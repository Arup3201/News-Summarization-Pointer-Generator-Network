While the tragic death of a president was about to kickstart Rather’s impressive career, the then 32-year-old managed to find Abraham Zapruder and his film but couldn’t quite get his hands on it for CBS.

‘This is not a time when everyone has a camera,’ Rather told Tom Brokaw in an interview for NBC News. ‘Not everyone has a motion picture camera.’

As the first journalist to report John F. Kennedy’s assassination, Rather is in a unique position to recount the terrible tale now, at the event’s 50 year anniversary.

Scroll down for video...

A tragic start to a famous career: Dan Rather was a 32-year-old bureau chief for CBS in Dallas when JFK was shot and recently recounted his struggle to find and then bid for a local man's unique footage of the terrible event

And he did so in Monday night’s 
television special My Days in Dallas: A Remembrance With Dan Rather, an 
exploration of the shooting on Nov. 22, 1963.

He recalls thinking, ‘The president is dead in front of thousands of people. There must be pictures.’

The race was on to become the first news organization to get footage of the president’s death.

‘We started making phone calls,’ Rather said, and within hours the CBS Dallas staff learned of a private citizen who had a camera. ‘Keep in mind, not many people had movie cameras.’

Miraculously, Rather says his team was able to track down Abraham Zapruder, a local businessman who took with him to the presidential motorcade his 8mm Bell & Howell Zoomatic camera.

Breaking it to the nation: Rather shot to national prominence not long after becoming the first to report to the nation the startling details of JFK's assassination in 1963

Near miss: Zapruder nearly left his 8mm Zoomatic that day, but his secretary insisted he take it despite the overcast skies. He later sold the footage he took for $150,000 to Life magazine

‘By the next morning, Mr. Zapruder, quite wisely, had a lawyer,’ Rather said.

Here, Rather leaves out a juicy part of the tale in his discussion with Brokaw that his national producer Don Hewitt does not gloss over in his own recounting.

Reports Newsday:

‘In my desire to get a hold of what was probably the most dramatic piece of news footage ever shot,’ Hewitt said, ‘I told Rather to go to Zapruder’s house, sock him in the jaw, take his film to our affiliate in Dallas, copy it onto videotape, and let the CBS lawyers decide whether it could be sold or whether it was in the public domain.’

In Hewett’s telling, Rather agreed that, yes, punching Zapruder and stealing the tape was the best idea. But the producer quickly had a change of heart.

‘I hadn’t hung up the phone maybe ten seconds when it hit me: What in the hell did you just do? Are you out of your mind? So I called Rather back. Luckily, he was still there.’

Instead of getting physical, Rather showed up to Zapruder’s attorney’s office to broker a deal to get the film. But he wasn’t the only newsman on the case.

Still, to this day: Much of what the world saw in the media from that November day in Dealey Plaza was in still photos like this. That's partially because Dan Rather and CBS were outbid for the motion footage by a print magazine, Life

Vantage: This recreation of the assassination  from 1997 shows a similar vantage point to the one Zapruder got in 1963. He was unique for the close vantage and also for having a motion camera in an era when they were relatively rare

Watch Dan Rather report to the world what he saw in Zapruder's footage...

‘I thought that we had the only access to Mr. Zapruder,’ Rather said. However, ‘Richard “Dick” Stolley—a great reporter—at Life magazine at that time…a tough reporter working for an outfit with deep pockets. I hated to see him there.’

Rather was told he could watch the footage once before making his bid for the film.

‘I’ll never forget being in that room. My head was back, my eyes were wide, my mouth was agape.’

‘I’ll never forget being in that room,’ he said. ‘My head was back, my eyes were wide, my mouth was agape.’

Rather was given the okay by his higher ups to pay at most $50,000 for the soon-to-be famous film.

But when he went to make his first offer, Zapruder’s attorney said the film had been sold. Stolley and Life had paid $150,000—what would be a million dollars today—for the film and stolen it right out from under Rather’s nose.

Nonetheless, Rather would go down in history as the first to report JFK’s death and his black and white likeness has become synonymous with the terrible moment in America.

Moments to live: Many still photos were taken and the first thing Rather and his CBS team looked for were shots of the moment JFK was killed. When he learned of motion footage and was then able to track it down, he jumped at the chance to buy it

Burned into his memory: 'I¿ll never forget being in that room. My head was back, my eyes were wide, my mouth was agape.'
