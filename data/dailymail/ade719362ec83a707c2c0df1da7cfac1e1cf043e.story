A broken neck would have put paid to most men's hopes of achieving anything in life, but instead it drove Warrick Brant on to becoming Australia's strongest man.     

Warrick, whose sister Lauren appeared in I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here earlier this month, suffered the traumatic accident playing rugby union when he was only 20 years old. The future had initially looked bright for the young prop who presented Australia at under-19 and under-21 level in 1998 and 1999.

But after playing a year professionally in England for Bedford, disaster struck when he returned to Australia and broke his neck in pre-season scrum training with the Queensland Reds.

Australia's strongest man Warrick Brant overcame a broken neck to fulfil his dreams

Warrick meets the world's most famous bodybuilder Arnold Schwarzenegger. He met the action star at the Arnold Strongman Classic in Columbus, Ohio, a fortnight ago 

Pulling a large truck is much easier than it seems according to Warrick 

It could not have come at a worse time as the following weekend he was due to train with the Australian national front-row training squad in Canberra.

‘It happened at scrum training. It was just one of those things – an unfortunate training accident,’ he told Daily Mail Australia.

‘I was in hospital for about a month and had two surgeries. I was in a neck brace for six months.’

The road to recovery was a long one. Just being able to drive his car again was a big ask, but it could have been worse.

Fed up with bodybuilding he began competing in strongman events to better utilise his training  

Warrick competes in the World's Strongest Man competition in Los Angeles last year. In this event he had to pull two trucks -the blue and maroon one behind are tied together - along a strip of road.

‘When I first got injured I could not use my right arm at all because I’d lost all my feeling in it. I couldn’t even eat my dinner; I had to use my left hand all the time. It was a pretty tough time,’ he explained.

The physical suffering he endured though was nothing compared to the mental anguish he went through at the time.

‘It’s not just the loss of a sport that you’ve loved all your life, but it’s the loss of a potential income as well,' Warrick told Daily Mail Australia. 

'Professional rugby was thriving, especially in England, and I thought I was set for life. But I couldn’t have been more wrong.

In this event at the World's Strongest Man competition in Los Angeles last year Warrick has to throw kegs of different weights over a bar five metres in the air

‘I don’t think I’ve ever got over it. I wouldn’t say I’m bitter but I’m still disappointed. I’m now working flat out and struggling to pay bills, which is the complete opposite to what I would have had if I’d been a professional rugby player.

‘But I have to remind myself that it could have been much worse and I may not have been able to even walk, so I have to constantly remember that.’

Contact sport was now out for Warrick. He soon put on a huge amount of weight and didn’t know what to do with himself until a friend came up with an idea – why not try bodybuilding?

After moving into powerlifting in 2005 he set an Australian record in the discipline

‘I had become depressed and was eating everything in sight. My weight ballooned,’ he said.

‘But my friend got me back in the gym training again and a year later persuaded me to get on stage and compete in the Queensland Bodybuilding Championships.

‘It was the best thing I could have done and my confidence started coming back.’

But after a year of this Warrick realised that what he enjoyed was the strength side of training rather than the appearance.

The Atlas Stones is one of strongman's signature events. Here Warrick raises one off the floor. The stones range in weight from 140-200 kilos.  

Instead of showing people his toned body he wanted to show them how strong he was. He did this by lifting massive weights in the gym to start with, before moving into powerlifting where in 2005 he set an Australian record in the discipline.

It was a simple transition after that to start competing in strongman competitions.

‘I always watched them on TV growing up. It was great to watch because they were big and strong, but they were also amazing athletes,’ Warrick said.

The fact that competitors were great athletes as well as being immensely strong was what attracted Warrick to taking part in the events 

Warrick first competed in America’s Strongest Man in 2008 and 2009. The rest as they say is history.

Last year he won the Southern Hemisphere’s Strongest Man title in Melbourne and Australia’s Strongest Man crown. He is also the only Australian to make the final of the World’s Strongest Man competition.

Unfortunately a muscle tear will rule him out of the 36th year of the World’s Strongest Man competition later this month in Malaysia, but he has nothing to prove at this stage.

He has pulled and lifted airplanes, trucks and buses over the years. But it's apparently easier than it sounds.

Warrick puts much of his success down to his wife Bethany who also acts as his nutritionist and physiotherapist

‘You can’t really train for it. You can’t go up to an airport and asked them to pull one of their planes. But funnily enough it’s not the hardest thing to do,’ he told Daily Mail Australia.

‘It’s more like conditioning work. It’s like doing a high-rep squats session where you just keep your legs moving. It may look spectacular but in reality it isn’t.’

Not that being Australia’s Strongest Man makes him the most famous person in his family. His sister Lauren was a member of the Australian pop group Hi-5 and recently appeared on television in I’m A Celebrity Get me Out Of Here.

His well known sister trains at the gym Warrick runs in the Gold Coast. Generally she does her workouts with her fiancée Warren. 

‘Lauren trains at my gym every day and is into general fitness. She trains there with Warren regularly. All my family is into sport in some way or another. We’ve got a very athletic background,’ he told Daily Mail Australia.

The 35-year-old trains four times a week for three hours each session doing a variety of weights regimes that will depend on the kind of strongman competition he'll be competing in. Generally he weighs in at between 145-150 kilos. 

Warrick attributes much of his success to his wife Bethany who is a former bodybuilder too. She has travelled with him to strongman competitions across the globe.

‘She acts as my trainer, my nutritionist, and my physiotherapist. She always makes sure I’m in perfect condition for every event,’ he said. 

Warrick's story proves that with dedication and perseverance you can still achieve your goals

The couple had their first baby, a girl called Indiana, in December. And it sounds like she also has her father’s fighting spirit.

‘She was born premature and arrived seven weeks early. She was three weeks in hospital in the Intensive Care Unit, but she’s all healthy now and doing well,’ Warrick said.
