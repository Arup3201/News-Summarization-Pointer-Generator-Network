It is a meeting which aims to promote everything good about racing in this country with over £4million of prizemoney.

But if you are betting, it has not always paid to be patriotic at Qipco British Champions Day at Ascot. 

The first three years of the end-of-season finale featuring five Group races, has seen over half won by runners from either France or Ireland and there is no sign of the foreign invasion relenting. 

Cirrus Des Aigles is tipped to repeat 2011 success in the Champion Stakes at Ascot

French warrior Cirrus Des Aigles, the 2011 winner, is favourite win a second Champion Stakes when his main rival could turn out be Free Eagle. 

An equally potent challenger from across the Channel is Charm Spirit, who can continue the wonderful month for the Head family in the Queen Eliazabeth II Stakes.

Two weeks after Criquette Head-Maarek secured a second Prix de L’Arc de Triomphe with Treve, brother Freddie saddles the winner of the Prix du Moulin and Prix Jean Prat insisting his colt is a different proposition to when he was fifth to Richard Hannon’s Night of Thunder in the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket in May.

The pair clash again and Head said: ‘I am very happy with him. The ground will be very testing and it will make it a tough mile but he will cope — he has won on the soft. He is more mature and relaxes which he never did in the Guineas.’

Seventeen Group One winners are due to line up, a decent number to soften the blow of high-profile absentees headed by Kingman and Australia.

By the end of the day, we should know whether Richard Hannon, in his first season since taking over from his father, will be champion trainer after his tussle with John Gosden.

Hannon leads by £215,000 and could be made to sweat as his rival attacks the Long Distance Cup (Flying Officer and Marzocco) and Champion Sprint (Gregorian) before his first runners — Night of Thunder and Toormore in the QEII Stakes — enter the fray.

Gosden also runs Western Hymn in the Champion Stakes, where Hannon saddles Pether’s Moon, worth £770,000 to the winner.

But the odds are in Hannon’s favour and, if results go his way, he could become the first British trainer to break the £5m barrier for the season.

He will hope for better than yesterday at Newmarket’s Future Champions Day when his favourites Ivawood (second in the Middle Park Stakes) and Estidhkaar (fourth in the Dewhurst Stakes) were beaten. Hannon said: ‘We still have air in our lungs and tomorrow might be different.’

It was Andrea Atzeni-ridden Belardo, a third Group One winner of the season for Roger Varian, who emerged on top in the Dewhurst and Charming Thought (William Buick) for Charlie Appleby, who landed the Middle Park.

The latter, now 16-1 for the 2,000 Guineas, was a first British Group One in the blue colours of Sheik Mohammed’s Godolphin since Saeed Bin Suroor’s Farhh won the Champion Stakes on today’s card a year ago.
