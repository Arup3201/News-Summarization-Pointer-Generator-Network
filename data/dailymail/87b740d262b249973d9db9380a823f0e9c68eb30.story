Matt Le Tissier believes Southampton look 'stronger' than they were last season, despite the summer sales of Adam Lallana, Luke Shaw, Dejan Lovren, Calum Chambers and Rickie Lambert.

Southampton sit second top of the Premier League after taking 10 points from their first five games, and striker Graziano Pelle is among the replacements proving an instant hit at St Mary's.

And Le Tissier, who made 540 appearances during a 17-year spell with Southampton, thinks the Saints look equally good despite Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal luring their stars away.

'They've done really well,' says Le Tissier. 'They put themselves in danger getting rid of so many players. Other clubs knew that (they would have to sell), but that's football.

'Ronald Koeman has done a cracking job on building the squad. In terms of depth, I think we're actually probably stronger than we were last season.'

Pelle's start to life in the Premier League has proved positive. The Italian striker has scored three goals to help Southampton creep up the table since signing from Feyenoord for £9million.

Dusan Tadic is another who, since joining from FC Twente for £10.9m, has fit in well and the Serbia international has two assists to his name.

But Le Tissier acknowledges the fixture list has not been the most challenging for Koeman's men.

Adam Lallana (Liverpool, £25m)

Rickie Lambert (Liverpool, £4m)

Luke Shaw (Manchester United, £31.5m)

   TOTAL FOR FIVE PLAYERS: £92.5million

'The fixtures since then were kind,' adds Le Tissier. 'They are all games you would look at from a standpoint and think you could win. 

'Then again, Manchester United probably looked at their first five fixtures and thought it looked like an easy 15 points on the board.

'Pelle has had a terrific start, he looks a very comfortable footballer and there's probably more to come. Toby Alderweireld got his debut against Newcastle and looked good. 

'Sadio Mane is yet to kick a ball for Southampton, and Jay Rodriguez is yet to start but he's on his way back from injury. Things are looking good.'
