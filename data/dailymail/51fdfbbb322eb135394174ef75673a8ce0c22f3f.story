A couple of decades ago, turning 60 meant a free carriage clock on retirement and joining the local bridge club. 

Nowadays, the outlook is remarkably different - as one kickboxing grandmother from Cornwall has proven.

Sharon Garner, 60, took up Thai-boxing after trying it out on holiday and claims the sport has helped to rid her of arthritis.

Sharon Garner, 60, started Thai boxing after trying it on holiday last April. The grandmother-of-seven from Cornwall has since lost two stone. She also claims the sport has helped to rid her of arthritis.

The grandmother-of-seven dabbled in the exercise during a trip to Turkey last April and enjoyed it so much that she took up weekly classes on her return. 

Since then, she has lost almost two stone and claims that many of her health problems have disappeared. 

She said: 'I live, eat and breathe it - all I think about is my kickboxing.

'I know it sounds silly at my age but I absolutely adore it.

'It works every exercise from your head to your toes and you do become a better person - I just wish I'd done it years ago.'

Sharon took up the sport to lose weight and beat depression. But she said it had also helped her tackle the arthritis that affects her spine and neck too

Sharon, who rents out property for a living with her husband Alwyn, took up the sport to lose weight and beat depression.

But she said it had also helped her tackle the arthritis that affects her spine and neck too.

She said: 'It's really helped me in a lot of ways.

'I was two stone overweight and suffering with depression when I started kickboxing in April 2014.

'Since then, I've lost weight, my arthritis has improved and I feel lots better.

'In fact I went for a check up with my GP recently and she said I was the healthiest woman she'd seen of my age.

'That's very pleasing.'

Sharon's son Carl, who now works in Saudi Arabia, used to kick-box and has several gold medals from national championships under his belt, but the sport never held any interest for her until last year. 

She now demonstrates her new skills during Skype sessions him and her seven grandchildren; Reece, 21, Alicia, 17, Jamie, 13, Anezka, 12, Ben,10, Amani, five and Ayeshia,

She said: 'My son was a British Champion and I just wasn't interested.

'Obviously I was interested in him as he was doing his fights and going to things and it was great but I never did it myself; I just think - by gum I wish I'd done it years ago. 

Carl and my grandchildren Facebook and Skype me all of the time about it.

'They're very proud – as is Alwyn.'
