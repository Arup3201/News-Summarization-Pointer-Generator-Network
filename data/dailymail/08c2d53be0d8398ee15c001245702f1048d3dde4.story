It's been several decades since she spread the message 'War is Over' with her late husband John Lennon, but Yoko Ono has embraced it once again in her latest work.

To The Light, in the Serpentine Gallery, is her first exhibition in a London public institution for more than a decade.

In one work of art on display there are three identical mounds of earth labeled 'Country A' 'Country B' and 'Country C' in front of the classic 'War Is Over' poster she made with John Lennon.

Visitors from all over the world can 
drop in to a specially-designed photo booth installed outside the 
Serpentine Gallery and record their smiles.

These
 images will then be collected to make #smilesfilm, which will be 
exhibited in a physical form on a screen at the Serpentine Gallery and 
presented globally in digital form on a dedicated website, 
smilesfilm.com, and apps for iPhone and iPad.

The Gallery says: 'Ono's project at 
the Serpentine will tap into the transformative potential of the smile, 
which can change an individual's view, but also radiate out into the 
world. Ono associates this transmission of positive energy with healing 
and peace.

'People from
 cities and countries around the world will be able to freely upload and
 send their smiles by mobile phone and computer to the world and its 
people. Each time we add our smiles to #smilesfilm, we are creating our 
future, together. Give us your smile! I love you!'
