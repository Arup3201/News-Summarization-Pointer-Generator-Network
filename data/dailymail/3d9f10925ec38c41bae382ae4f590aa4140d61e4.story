The South is battling to get back on its feet after an unusual winter storm pummeled the area on Wednesday, leaving hundreds of thousands without power and shuttering schools and businesses.

More than 600,000 customers are still without power and heat after the storm ravaged towns and cities from Texas to Virginia and left the area covered in a sheet of ice.

Utilities companies reported more than 228,000 customers had no power in Georgia on Thursday, 183,000 customers had no power in North Carolina and 210,000 had no power in South Carolina, the Weather Channel reported.

On Thursday, the North Carolina 
Department of Transportation began hauling cars off state highways to clear the way for snow plows, and the effort continued into 
the afternoon.

Clear up: On Thursday, police and wrecker crews work to remove dozens of vehicles that were either parked or abandoned in Raleigh, North Carolina as residents tried to get home during Wednesday's storm

States of emergency were declared from
 Louisiana to Virginia, and officials warned families to stay home on 
Thursday until temperatures start to thaw towards the weekend.

'Hunker down and stay home,' South Carolina Governor 
Nikki Haley told residents on Thursday.

Families were also warned about dangerous sheets of ice falling from the tops of buildings as the weather starts to warm. No injuries have been reported so far.

'The
 ice storm was as bad as we expected,' said weather.com meteorologist 
Jon Erdman. 'One inch or more of ice accumulation was reported in at 
least seven South Carolina counties, as well as Richmond County, 
Georgia.

'Meanwhile, up to 
11 inches of snow piled up in parts of east Tennessee, even into parts 
of northwest Georgia. Huntsville, Alabama picked up from 4 to 7 inches 
of snow.'

On Thursday morning, residents awoke 
to a world of ice-laden trees and driveways the area is unaccustomed to 
dealing with. Schools remained closed and look likely to stay shut on 
Friday.

Nineteen inches of snow were reported in Cherry Grove, West Virginia on Thursday morning, 18 in Winchester, Virginia, and 15 in Saluda, North Carolina.

A half-inch or more of ice also hit a wide area of central Georgia, including in Augusta and Marietta, while three inches coated Forest Acres, South Carolina.

Only a half-inch of ice is needed to bring down a power line, Rob Carolan, owner of Hometown Forecast Services Inc. in Nashua, New Hampshire, told Bloomberg.

Drivers in and around Raleigh, North Carolina became snarled Wednesday in huge traffic jams and abandoned cars in scenes reminiscent of motorist woes in Atlanta during a storm two weeks earlier.

Update: Georgia Governor Nathan Deal - who was much more on the ball regarding preparations this time around - said areas around Augusta had been hardest hit and were largely without power

Covered: Atlanta remained under a sheet of ice on Thursday, a day after the brutal winter storm

But meteorologists predict that the 
area will begin thawing out later this afternoon when sunnier skies 
appear - although authorities asked people to remain at home.

In
 Atlanta, many streets were eerily quiet this storm, with drivers 
heeding dire warnings to stay off the roads. State troopers say they 
worked more than 200 crashes in Georgia.

For some on slick, snow-covered interstates in North Carolina, commutes that should take minutes lasted hours after many got on the highways just as soon as snow and sleet began at midday.

And in South Carolina, more accustomed to occasional hurricanes, some could only relate the damage from ice-snapped tree limbs to that of bygone Hurricane Hugo.

Stunning: Snow falls and gathers on tree limbs in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning lasting into Thursday covering 95 of the state's 100 counties

Back on the road: Andre Randolph and William Evans ride their bikes through the snow, calling the conditions 'good training' for an upcoming race in downtown Fredericksburg, Virginia

Even normally balmy Myrtle Beach, 
where millions of visitors cavort each summer, cars were coated in thick
 ice that also frosted palm trees and kiddie rides by the shore.

The
 Weather Channel reported that at least 18 deaths have been blamed on 
the storm: four in North Carolina, three in South Carolina, two in 
Mississippi, two in Georgia and seven in Texas.

More than 300 car accidents occurred on Georgia roads and another 300 occurred in Mississippi on Wednesday and Thursday.

In Georgia, emergency responders reported that at least seven people have been hospitalized in sledding accidents.
