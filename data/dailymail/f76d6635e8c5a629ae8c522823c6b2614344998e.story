Grieving relatives of the two Australians killed when a Germanwings Airbus was flown into a mountain in the French Alps are preparing for an 'unbearably' sad day when they visit the crash site early next week.

Relatives of Carol Friday, 68, and her 29-year-old son Greig, both from Melbourne, are en route to Germany this weekend.

This comes as tributes continue to flow for the two Australians killed when Germanwings flight 4U 9525 lost altitude and crashed into a remote region of the French Alps.

The mother and son were killed when the passenger jet, en route from Barcelona, Spain, to Dusseldorf, northern Germany, came down early in the 90-minute flight on Tuesday.

New photos of the 29-year-old have since emerged, showing him as a political activist who campaigned for equality.

Greig, who was to turn 30 on April 23, was a mechanical engineer who studied at Melbourne's Monash University and worked for Jacobs Engineering

Relatives of the mother and son are expected to fly to France on Monday and travel by road to Seyne-les-Alpes near the crash site.

'We are expecting the family to visit the site early next week, probably on Monday,' said Australia's ambassador in Paris, Stephen Brady.

'We hope that provides a small degree of solace.'

Carol Friday's brother, Mal Coram, will represent the family in Seyne along with his two daughters, Georgie and Pippa. The Melbourne nurse's husband, Dave, and the couple's daughter, Alex, aren't travelling to France.

The Corams will pay their respects at a newly erected memorial for the victims.

Fairfax Media has reported they'll leave tributes from other family and friends including poems, photos and reminders of the Australian bush that Carol and Greig loved.

'I think that's a very beautiful gesture,' Mr Brady said on Friday.

'We'll do everything we can to make an unbearable day a little easier for them.' 

A statement from the Friday family said Greig was 'a man who loved others and life with a full heart'

Australia's consul-general from Paris will be on hand to help the relatives in southern France.

Specialists are combing the wreckage for body parts and DNA samples that will enable them to identify the 150 people who died in Tuesday's crash that was apparently deliberately initiated by co-pilot Andreas Lubitz.

Prosecutors have revealed the German hid a serious illness from the airline amid reports he was severely depressed.

Mr Brady on Friday thanked the French government for its handling of the disaster.

'I have nothing but praise for the swiftness and comprehensiveness of the French government's response,' the ambassador said.

'Despite not suffering any losses themselves the French have not stinted in providing a superb response to this tragic event.'

France was rocked by the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack in January and is now coping with what appears to be one of Europe's worst peacetime massacres since World War II.

'It's been two human tragedies of immense scale and consequence,' Mr Brady said from Paris.

'There's a resolve in government circles to ensure that the French state is able to cope with any crisis.

'But the atmosphere is sombre. It's deeply reflective.'

Germany and Spain bore the brunt of the tragedy with 75 Germans dead and at least 50 Spaniards on board the Barcelona to Duesseldorf flight 4U9525.

French Prime Minister Manuel Valls has said that 'everything is pointing towards an act that we can't describe: criminal, crazy, suicidal.'

Since the plane crash, Greig's Facebook page is now serving as memorial with posts on climate change, world heritage, and gay rights issues.

Greig's former manager at Jacob's engineering Sarah Alper said staff have been left devastated, according to SBS News. 

'It's really devastating because our memory of him is that he was so happy and so excited about his adventure. It is just really sad.'

Carol, a nurse for more than 40 years, had dedicated her life to helping others.

Lisa Fitzpatrick from the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation said Carol's work with both Indigenous and refugee communities was testament to her generous spirit.

'She's worked with Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory. She's a woman who's demonstrated that her social perspective in helping others is not something she's just done in her working life but she has certainly been involved with working with refugees when they came from Kosovo to Australia back in the late 90s,' she said. 

The Friday family issued a statement through Foreign Minister Julie Bishop  saying they were in 'deep disbelief and crippled with sadness' over the death of the 68-year-old nurse and 29-year-old engineer.

'They were both extraordinary and exceptional people who were loved by many, who they loved in return. They will forever be with us in our hearts, memories and dreams,' it read.  

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and Prime Minister Tony Abbott both offered their condolences to the family of the two Australian victims

Mrs Friday, who turned 68 just two days ago, was on a holiday with her son who was planning to remain in Europe so he could teach English.

Greig, who was about to turn 30 on April 23, was a mechanical engineer who studied at Melbourne's Monash University and worked for Jacobs Engineering.  

'He also loved to travel and had just completed a course for teaching English as a foreign language, which he was hoping to do in France in the coming year,' the family said.

'Greig was a man who loved others and life with a full heart.' 

His mother was described as a devoted wife to her husband Dave and loving mother to Greig and daughter Alex. She was a registered nurse and midwife who regularly travelled.

'Carol loved life! She enjoyed every minute with her family and friends,' her family said.

'She was a talented artist and enjoyed spending time creating with her local art group. She loved to travel and has seen many of the world's greatest sights.

'Carol and Greig were enjoying a few weeks holiday together at the start of his European stay.'

The news came as the first pictures of some of those lost emerged - and search teams recovered the black box from the crash site, where wreckage, bodies and personal belongings were strewn across a large area on the mountainside.

'I don't think it gets any easier announcing the death of Australian citizens in a tragedy overseas,' Ms Bishop said.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims of this shocking tragedy. We extend our condolences to the governments of Germany, France and Spain and their people who appear to have borne the brunt of this tragedy.' 

Ms Bishop's prayers were echoed by Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews. 

'This incident will be a very painful reminder of other disasters in recent times - whether it's MH370 or MH17 - this will be a very raw moment for many Victorian families who have had to live through those tragedies just in the space of the last 12 months,' Mr Andrews said.
