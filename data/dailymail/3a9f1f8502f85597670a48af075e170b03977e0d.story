Olivia Palermo impressed on the red carpet in Cannes last week with her long, luscious locks. Now the secret to how the actress achieved her flawless hairstyle has been revealed.

Her hairdresser, Mark Woolley from Electric Hair salon in London, told the MailOnline her beauty secret weapon is Electric Hair's new Intensive Treatment Masque, £23.50.

The protein-enriched serum is said to hydrate the cuticles for a glossy mane and nourish the ends to give the effect of longer looking hair.

Mark explained how he uses the masque on the actress's hair. He said: 'Olivia's got fine hair but lots of it, as most people have, so the masque treats the hair without making it heavy.

'The masque is really light weight due to its viscosity due to the way we mix it at high speed.

'She can have an Electric masque treatment the same day as a voluminous blow dry. No other masque allows it.'

Olivia regularly visits the 
Electric London salon as well as having home visits from Mark 
himself to cut, treat and blow-dry her hair to perfection.

The 27-year-old, who shot to fame in MTV's The City, showed off her glossy locks in Cannes last week. She wore her caramel hair down and wavy to the amfAR Cinema Against AIDS 2013 charity event on Thursday.

Then for The Immigrant premiere, she styled her mane into a sleek yet 
voluminous and bouncy ponytail.

The new Masque is rich yet lightweight in
formula, penetrating hair to leave it feeling nourished with a
glossy finish - without being weighed down.

Packed full of moisturising ingredients, it is suitable for all hair types to smooth, soften 
and detangle, leaving behind a healthy shine.

The 
advanced technology of the masque is said to nourish the hair and 
act 'as a moisture balancing mechanism'. It comes in stylish packaging and with a delicate fragrance.

Beginning as a salon ritual, Intensive Treatment Masque is now on sale to consumers due to high demand.

Harvey Nichols and Fortnum and Mason stock the brand from this month on their website.

Other fans of Electric Hair Care include 
Daisy Lowe and Paloma Faith, the brand reports.

The treatment masque 
is a cocoon for hair full of moisturising lipids and proteins without 
weighing down the hair- suitable for all hair types.

Forming a 
protective film over the hair with wheatgerm extract the treatment works
to hydrate the cuticle in ten minutes to reveal brand new glossy 
looking hair nourishing the ends to give the effect of longer looking 
hair.

Directions:

Use every 7 to 10 days as the ultimate home ritual.

Apply an almond-sized amount to wet hair and massage in with finger tips and thumbs, focusing on the mid lengths and ends.

For best results, leave on for 10 minutes then rinse out thoroughly.
