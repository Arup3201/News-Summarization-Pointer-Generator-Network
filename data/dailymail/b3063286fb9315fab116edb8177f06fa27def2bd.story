Lil Fatty, Baby Hobbit and Happy Meal are just a few of the bizarre and outrageous nicknames pregnant moms across the country have given to their unborn babies.  

Ovia, a pregnancy tracking app developed by Harvard scientists, quizzed more than two million of its users about their future children’s quirky monikers in order to discover the most bizarre baby nicknames from all 50 states. 

'Baby nicknames are so special because they're one of the first emotional connections a mother has with her unborn baby,' Ovia's director of design Ingrid Pierre told People.

She added: 'Creating pet names is a very human thing to do. It introduces intimacy into your language with your new child.'

While the app's top three chosen nicknames were Peanut, Bean and Baby, Ovia's default option, other parents-to-be, who were asked to come up with their perfect nickname upon signing up to the app, wanted to be as original as possible.

Pig products proved to be popular with a number of parents from Nevada, a couple of whom dubbed their babies Pork Bun and Pepperoni.

Some mothers from the Lone Star state were filled hometown pride when they chose the names Texas and Lone Ranger for their unborn children, while expecting parents in Massachusetts opted for ferocious fighting monikers such as Little Champion and Lil A** Kicker.

And when it comes to picking nicknames for their future children, there were notable regional differences.

Southern states favored confectionery inspired names, including King Cake Bebe and Sugarbutt. 

Special research: Ovia asked more than two million of its users to give their unborn babies a nickname when signing up for the app, which tracks pregnancies  

Meanwhile, animals and insects were popular on the West Coast as parents from those states chose Tiniest Bear, Little Ladybug and Lil Bird for their babies' nicknames. 

And Nebraskans were inspired by music. 

Little Drummer and Future Rockstar were the unique nicknames chosen by some moms in the Midwestern state. 

In response to Ovia's findings, People asked its readers to share their unborn babies' special nicknames. 

'I nicknamed my daughter Doodlebug and my son Dimples,' one parent responded.

Another wrote: 'My sister still to this day calls my oldest son "Rooster". She doesn't even recall why she started calling him that.'

Although Ovia's research revealed strange nicknames, unique monikers are also in demand for parents who want their children's names to one of a kind creations that are as special as they are. 

A Swedish company Erfolgswelle charges parents upwards of $30,000 for the creation of tailor-made and 'unheard of' names for their soon-to-be born babies.
