Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart is unconcerned by the soft goals his side have conceded this season, suggesting it is down to attempts from manager Manuel Pellegrini to develop their trademark attacking performances.

City have conceded 19 goals in 15 matches in all competitions and are third in the Premier League, already trailing leaders Chelsea by nine points.

Pellegrini's side will look to cut that deficit when they face Manchester United on Sunday and Hart believes as long as City stick to the Chilean's methods, they will have a successful campaign.

"We've leaked goals, simple goals have gone in and people have taken their chances against us, but with the way we play, we are quite open to conceding the odd goal or two," Hart said in an interview with The Independent. 

"Unfortunately, that is not great as a goalkeeper, but you've got to be realistic and understand we are trying to build a way of playing football that potentially is going to lead to letting the odd goal in. 

"It is not something we accept, but as long as we carry on playing the way we're playing under this philosophy that we've got under the manager, we will be fine."

Hart also dismissed criticism aimed at defender Eliaquim Mangala, a £32million summer arrival from Porto.

Mangala has endured a torrid beginning to his City career, epitomised in City's 2-0 defeat against West Ham United where he was relentlessly targeted by Diafra Sakho and Enner Valencia.

But Hart believes the France international will prove to be an astute addition to the Premier League champions.

"Mangala knows we are more than confident in him, the manager is more than confident in him, and that is the most important thing."
