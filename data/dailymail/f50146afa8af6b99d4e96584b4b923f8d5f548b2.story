Ministers have handed out billions in foreign aid even after being told that much of it is being wasted, it can be revealed.

Since the election, the Department for International Development (DfID) has given £3.3 billion to 12 organisations that offer ‘poor’ or ‘average’ value for money.

Five have been judged by civil servants to offer ‘poor’ value for money. The other seven, including the European Commission, are deemed ‘average’. Shockingly, DfID has increased funding for five of the groups.

The revelation will further anger Tory backbenchers who vehemently disagree with David Cameron’s decision to give 0.7 per cent of the country’s output in aid.

They say it is unfair that British people are suffering cuts to public services and defence budgets while money is being poured into ineffective multilateral bodies.

Yesterday it emerged that Britain spent £10.6 billion on overseas aid in 2013, an increase of 28 per cent on the previous year. We are second only to the US in terms of development cash being handed out.

Conservative MP Peter Bone said: ‘Because they are so determined to meet the 0.7 per cent target, there has been no time to hand out money based on need. 

'So they have been in a rush to give it to organisations that are below value for money – and that’s just crazy.

'The best way to get value for money is to give funds directly to charities and not dole it out to organisations. Aid policy is now based on targets, not need, and that's disappointing'

‘The best way to get value for money is to give funds directly to charities and not dole it out to organisations. Aid policy is now based on targets, not need, and that’s disappointing.’

The biggest beneficiary of Britain’s aid budget is the European Commission, which has been given £2.4 billion in the past three years.

Last year aid minister Alan Duncan said DfID was ‘forced’ to give a sixth of its aid budget to the EU and was powerless over how it was spent.

Department civil servants criticise Brussels for giving too much aid money to middle-income countries, saying its results are ‘mixed’ and its procedures are ‘inflexible’.

Robert Oxley, campaign director of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Throwing taxpayers’ money at organisations that offer poor value is all too typical of a department more desperate to hit spending targets than ensuring it spends its budget wisely.’

In 2011, the Coalition ranked all organisations which receive money in terms of whether they offered ‘very good’, ‘good’, ‘average’ or ‘poor’ value for money.

In the first year of the Government, £1.07 million was spent with the 12 ‘average’ and ‘poor’ organisations.

The next year (2011/12), this had gone up to £1.13million, while last year it was £1.09million. The total over the past three years has been £3.26million.

'I think we should actually be really proud of the fact we are leading on this'

One of the worst recipients in terms of value for money is the Food and Agriculture Organisation, to which we have given £96.9 million over the past three years – making us the world’s fourth largest contributor.

The money was given despite DfID’s annual report attacking the FAO’s ‘cost consciousness, transparency and financial management’.

Unesco got £55million, even though DfID is concerned about its high overhead costs and the fact that it needs to do ‘more work on transparency’.

DfID has increased spending since the election on five of the groups: the Caribbean Development Fund, the Inter-American Development Bank, the United Nations Population Fund, the World Health Organisation and UN Women.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg defended the aid budget, saying a failure to help could lead to instability in Africa or Asia. He said the country 'should be proud' of spending money on 'some of the poorest... some of the most wretched countries' in the world. Pictured are refugees crossing the border from Syria into Iraq

A spokesman for DfID said: ‘The Multilateral Aid Review process, introduced by this Government, provides a rigorous assessment of the value for money of multilateral agencies and has been adopted internationally.

'If under-performing multilaterals do not improve against the reforms we set, we are prepared to take decisions to end our funding.’

Nick Clegg defended the aid budget on his LBC radio phone-in yesterday, saying failure to help could lead to instability in Africa and Asia, and an increase in migrants.

He said: ‘I think we should actually be really proud of the fact that we are leading on this.

‘Spending money on some of the poorest countries in the world, on some of the most wretched communities in the world: it’s not just a sort of reckless act of charity; it is actually in our own interests.’
