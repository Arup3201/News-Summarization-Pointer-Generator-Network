Shoppers have been left outraged after town hall bosses ditched their traditional Christmas tree in favour of  a 'futuristic' £10,000 monstrosity.

The towering 21st century ‘tree’ has left people in Ipswich town centre bemused after it appeared this weekend - with one comparing it to 'a load of space-age hamster balls'. 

The 30ft Christmas decoration includes 41 aluminium spheres covered in more than 40,000 low energy LED lights.

The futuristic £10,000 tree looks out of place against the traditional backdrop in the Ipswich market square as Christmas shoppers rush past

The tree is part of a brand new £100,000 Christmas display across the town funded by taxpayers and businesses in Ipswich, Suffolk.

The costly display - which includes 250,000 low energy bulbs - was thought up by business bosses in a bid to help attract more shoppers to the town during the festive season.

But shoppers have been less than impressed by the tree.

Mother-of-two Maggie Bailey, 38, from Ipswich, said: 'It looks like a load of space-age hamster balls rather than a Christmas tree.

'I dread to think how much it has cost but surely Christmas is a time of tradition, so why do they have to have an arty tree?

'Children love to see a Christmas tree with all the decorations on but they are hardly going to get excited about this.'

Shoppers look on in bemusement at the 30ft futuristic Christmas 'tree', which popped up in the place of the town's traditional evergreen

Martin Hall, 64, from Bury St Edmunds, added: 'It is certainly unusual - I guess people will be talking about it so in that respect it could be judged to be a success.

'I certainly wouldn’t want one like this in my living room but maybe I am behind the times.'It looks quite futuristic but I would not say I am a big fan of it.'

Traditionally
Ipswich has celebrated Christmas by erecting a large fir tree in the 
Cornhill - a market square which has been in use for more than 500 
years.

But business leaders
- including members of business group Ipswich Central which helped pay 
for the tree - say the town needed to break from tradition

Last week shoppers in Herne Bay branded their new Christmas tree, pictured, 'disgusting'. The tree became a front runner for Britain's worst as locals BOOED the switch on

Paul Clement, chief executive of Ipswich Central, defended his towns controversial futuristic structure saying its now infamous design will help get people talking about the town.

He said: 'This is the most talked about tree in East Anglia - probably in the UK this year.

“Love it or hate it, everyone is talking about it, and thousands of people are heading into Ipswich to see it and make up their own minds.

'Most other towns would give their right arm to have this amount of conversation about them at this time of year.'

But that response didn’t impress traditional shopper Dennis Nedd. He concluded: 'I would have just liked a normal Christmas tree.

'I keep wondering when the real tree and decorations are going to be delivered.'

In Herne Bay, Kent, last week pantomime stars Gareth Gates and Toyah Wilcox were jeered by crowds who were shocked by the 'atrocious' decorations as they tried to turn on the lights.

The pathetic tree did not look like it was in the Christmas spirit with merely a handful of lights - leading residents and business leaders to slam it as having the 'worst decorations in Britain'.

Another contender for the worst decorations goes to a pathetically limp Christmas tree planted in the centre of Dunsdale, Cleveland, last year.

It was judged to be so lifeless it was removed by embarrassed council bosses in the middle of the night before December even arrived.

In 2009 a fake tree in Poole, Dorset, offended locals so much that it was vandalised and town bosses were forced to take it down and replace it with something more traditional - a 30ft Norwegian spruce.

The astroturf clad £14,000 'tree' was compared to a witches hat and a traffic cone by disgusted residents. It had originally been erected because of 'elf and safety fears that a traditional tree could blow over

This 2009 tree - costing £14,000 - upset people in Poole, Dorset, so much that it was vandalised. Town hall bosses had to give in and erect a real tree
