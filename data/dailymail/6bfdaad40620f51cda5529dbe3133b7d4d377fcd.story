Eric Erron Johnson, 29, from west London, was jailed for nine years in August 2008 for manslaughter

A drug-dealing killer who was jailed for nine years for manslaughter has been told he can’t be deported because he is an illegitimate child.

Eric Erron Johnson, 29, who was convicted of manslaughter in 2008 after killing a man by hitting him with a piece of wood and stabbing him, was born to a British citizen and a Jamaican woman out of wedlock.

He was facing deportation to Jamaica after being jailed but a High Court judge has now ruled there has been a violation of his human rights.

Because he was illegitimate he was not entitled automatically to become a British citizen on birth, and then did not apply before he was 18.

Mr Justice Dingemans, sitting in London, said it would be open to an immigration tribunal to conclude that Johnson cannot be deported because he has ‘unjustifiably’ suffered discrimination as an illegitimate child, in violation of Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which protects against discrimination, and Article 8 (right to private and family life).

The judge quashed a Home Office decision to certify Johnson's human rights claim was ‘clearly unfounded’ and said there must be further consideration of his case.

He said that, under 
human rights laws, ‘it is not permissible to treat children born out of 
wedlock as having no links with their parents' and said in this case 'paternity 
is established.’

It means Johnson, from west London, has the option to appeal to an immigration tribunal against the Home Office refusal to revoke the deportation order.

The judge described how Johnson’s London-born father went to Jamaica and had a relationship with his natural mother, but they did not marry.

Johnson was registered as a Jamaican national and at the age of four he came to the UK with his father and lived with his father's new wife and his half-brothers.

In March 1992 he was granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK and has lived in the country ever since.

At the age of nine he visited his natural mother in Jamaica, but that was the last contact he had with her.

Neither he nor his father made an application for him to acquire British citizenship before he was 18, although it would probably have been granted under the then existing rules.

The judge said Johnson now had ‘a very serious criminal record’ with offences committed over a five-year period since he became 18 in 2003.

The judge described him as ‘a supplier of class A drugs for commercial gain’ and told how he was convicted of manslaughter in August 2008 after a trial in which he falsely claimed to have acted in self-defence.

The Home Office immigration authorities began moves to deport him in March 2011 on the grounds that he was ‘a foreign national’ whose removal would be ‘conducive to the public good’.
