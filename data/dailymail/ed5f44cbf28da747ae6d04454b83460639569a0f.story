Steve Higgins, pictured, was awarded £1,000 in compensation from Synergy Leads Ltd. The company has yet to pay the money

A father-of-three has successfully won compensation from a phone company that bombarded him with calls about payment protection insurance.

Steve Higgins, 38, is believed to be one of the first people to receive a payout from such a business after he and his wife, Gemma, 27, received almost 100 cold calls in just two months.

The couple, from Northampton, told Synergy Leads Ltd that they were not eligible for a pay-out, but the calls kept coming.

He decided to take action against the firm, which is registered with Companies House at an residential address in Camerton, Bath.

He invoiced the company £10 per call he received, stating they were wasting his time. he gave them two weeks to reply but after not hearing anything he made a claim for a default judgement on the basis that they had not responded.

A judge ruled in his favour and Synergy Leads Ltd was ordered to pay £1,000 - £940 for the calls plus £60 for making the court claim application.

Little information exists on Synergy Leads Ltd. An address search shows it is based in a cottage in an idyllic part of Somerset, around seven miles out of Bath.

The company's contact number is ex-directory and it does not have a website.

Mr Higgins, from Nottingham, said: 'I think it sends a message to telesales companies that there's a way for customers to fight back.

'I don't think I'll get the money back to be honest. I'll go down the enforcement route and send bailiffs out to the registered address.

'It wasn't about the money - it was more about the principle and I wanted everybody to know that they don't have to stand by and allow these nuisance calls to persist in their homes.

'They were breaking the law because we were registered with the Telephone Preference Service - which means they should not have been contacting us in the first place.

'But when I tried to call them - I was just spoken too very rudely and sometimes they would even hang up on me.

'There was just no way of communicating with them and it had got to the point where it was unbearable and I felt like I had no choice but to chase it through the small claims court.'

Synergy Leads was given until today to pay up, but the company has not yet done so. The company could not be contacted for comment.

Nick Pickles, director of privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: 'People need to know that whether it’s their phone number or address, their personal information cannot be passed around by companies with no regard whatsoever for people's privacy.

'This case is another step towards tackling companies who fail to show our personal information any respect and might make more unscrupulous marketing companies think twice before ringing up every number they can get their hands on.'
