As bystanders gawped in horror at 144 years of history going up in flames in Eastbourne last week, one art student saw the opportunity for a classic photo. 

Clutching a bottle of cider and dressed in just a leopard-print bikini, Louisa Foley draped herself pin-up style across a wooden breakwater as behind her the town's pier went up in smoke. 

Now, after the provocative picture spread like wildfire across the Internet, she has spoken out to defend it from critics appalled by her 'irreverence'.

Irreverent: Louisa Foley poses pin-up style in the photo in front of burning Eastbourne pier which has gone viral

The Leeds College of Art student described the controversy surrounding the picture as 'ridiculous' and 'hilarious'. She says she plans to frame the photo and give it to her parents.

Eastbourne pier was engulfed in flames on Wednesday after a fire started in its domed amusement hall. 

'My friend was visiting Eastbourne, where I'm from, so we decided to pop down to the beach,' Miss Foley told Leeds student newspaper The Tab.

'We were drinking and enjoying the sun when she asked me if the pier usually has smoke coming from it.

'That's when we realised it was on fire and saw it as a great photo opportunity - it's not exactly something you see every day.'

The photograph was posted onto Imgur, an image sharing website, where in five days it has attracted nearly 1.3million views and hundreds of - mostly admiring - comments.

But some responding on the website were angry at what they perceived as a lack of respect.

'Really wish people would stop taking pictures of my town's historic landmark burning. So many memories on that pier,' wrote one Eastbourne local.

Another said: 'Uh...isn't that just a liiiiiitle bit insensitive?' while a third wrote: 'This actually seems kind of messed up'.

A fourth bitterly wrote: 'So fashionable to enjoy destruction and human suffering...'

Another opined: 'If it were in America or any patriotic country she would be confronted. No-one has respect in my town.'

Others were more appreciative of the picture's artistic merit. 'She's smoking,' quipped the top-rated comment, while others compared her to Betty Page or Katy Perry.

Miss Foley said of her critics: 'It's ridiculous. It's a great shame that it's happened as the pier's obviously a great landmark in Eastbourne but at the end of the day there's all kinds of photos throughout history of similar events.

'I think it's hilarious how some people are making assumptions of how I'm a tourist or on my day off from work - why do they care?

'They're making assumptions about my life and who I am, which is none of their business.

'It was literally just two girls on a beach, and we decided to take a few photos.

'Of course the burning pier is the main part of the picture but it's a historic event and we wanted to capture it. It's not like we were the only ones taking photos.'

She said that her friends and family had found the furore 'funny', adding: 'Might frame it for my parents.'
