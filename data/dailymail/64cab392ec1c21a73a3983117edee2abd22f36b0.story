Urine the clear: Despite being filmed urinating into his colleagues' kettle, police say Gao committed no crime as he is free of disease

Four female nursery teachers who were suspicious about their strange-smelling tea trained a hidden camera on their thermos flasks - and discovered a cigarette-smoking colleague was urinating in them.

Chinese police arrested 54-year-old Gao Chao and took him to hospital where he was tested for infectious diseases.

But they say the teacher at Dongsheng Art Kingergarten, in the north eastern city of Lianyungang, committed no crime because he has a clean bill of health so his actions caused no harm.

The four women aged between 21 and 26 complained to police after saying they had discovered the reason why their tea smelt strange.

They set up a hidden camera in one of the classrooms and saw that the kindergarten's only male teacher had been relieving himself into their thermos flasks.

The man reportedly felt his female colleagues did not respect him enough, and was bitter at being passed over for the job of kindergarten boss.

But teacher Li Kao, 26, one of the four, said she was furious that police had simply given the man nothing more than a stern lecture and a warning not to do it again.

She said: 'I first noticed there was a strange smell from my tea a few weeks ago after I returned to the class after taking the children out to play in the playground.

'The cups are not transparent, so it was hard to see if the liquid looked strange but there was certainly a strange smell which also came from the thermos flasks that the tea was stored in.

'I changed the flask and bought a new one but once I brought it to the kindergarten again I had the same problem with the strange smell.

Flushed out: One of the four teachers lays the trap before her colleague wanders into the room unawares

The perfect grime: The man zips up and walks away, not knowing police would soon swoop on the school

'Eventually I discovered that my three colleagues had the same problem, and we thought perhaps somebody was putting something in the water.'

The women complained to kindergarten boss Qiu Li Shih, 37, who advised them to put a camera in the room.

So they activated the camera on a mobile phone and put it in a basket filled with children's toys.

The video showed the man, who appeared to
 be smoking a cigarette, picking up one of the women's brand new pink 
flasks and holding it close over his genitals while he contaminated her 
morning drink.

All four women refused to return to work if their colleague was not sacked.

However, the stand-off was resolved when he agreed to pay around Â£200 to each of the women, apologised, and promised not to do it again.
