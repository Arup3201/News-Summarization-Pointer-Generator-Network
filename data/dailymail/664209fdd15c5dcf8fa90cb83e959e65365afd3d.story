The iPhone may just put the 'I' in phone as a new study reveals that those who left their devices behind for even a few minutes felt a 'lessening of self.'

A study from the University of Missouri called 'The Extended iSelf: The Impact of iPhone Separation on Cognition, Emotion, and Physiology,' found that being separated from the iPhone can lead to 'physiological anxiety' and 'poor cognitive performance.'

The study published on Thursday in the Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication surveyed 40 iPhone using subjects from three different journalism courses.

I miss my iPhone: The iPhone may just put the 'I' in phone as a new study reveals that those who left their devices behind for even a few minutes felt a 'lessening of self'

The group was meant to be representative of students at a large university.

CBS reports that during the first experiment members of the study were told to sit in a room and complete a puzzle while they still were in possession of their phone.

They were then instructed to complete a second puzzle but were told that their phone was causing Bluetooth interference and would need to temporarily be confiscated.

While subjects were completing the puzzle, the researchers called their phones and the subjects were able to hear it but did not know where it was nor were they allowed to answer it.

During the study the researchers conducting the study took note of participant’s heart rate and blood pressure.

A release published by the researchers said that when the subjects were separated from their phones their anxiety, heart rate, and blood pressure increased and they were less able to complete the puzzle. 

Researchers wrote that people should avoid being separated from their technology at all costs, especially during an important task.

'iPhone users avoid parting with their phones during daily situations that involve a great deal of attention,' said the release.

Russell Clayton who worked on the study said that  people in the study who were separated from their phones had debilitating separation anxiety.

'Our advice would be to carry your iPhone with you but to silence your phone during cognitively demanding tasks (i.e., work, meetings, exams, etc) in order to avoid any potential distractions that may reduce your attention throughout the day,' Clayton told The Huffington Post.
