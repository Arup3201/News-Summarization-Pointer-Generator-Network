It attracts one million visitors every year and counts itself among Britain’s most popular tourist sites.

So it is perhaps surprising that Stonehenge has been featured in a list of the world’s most disappointing destinations.

The prehistoric monument, located in Wiltshire, joined a host of the planet’s most visited destinations and attractions including the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt and Paris as places that left visitors most unimpressed.

Stonehenge is the UK's most famous prehistoric monument but has been branded a disappointment

Despite being located next to the busy A303, Stonehenge welcomes more visitors than any other English Heritage site in the country

Voters on social networking site Reddit.com,  criticised Stonehenge because it was ‘small, you can’t get very close to it, and it’s really not worth the rather long journey from London’.

It is also just yards away from the busy A303 main road.

One student pointed out that nearby Avebury Henge was much better, claiming it was ‘bigger and you can walk right up to it’.

The monument was built about 5,000 years ago, and is believed to have been used as a site where prehistoric people buried the dead.

It welcomes more visitors than any other English Heritage site in the country, and the organisation reported an 18.9 per cent rise is visitors last year and with up to 5,000 people a day flocking to the site in July and August.

It wasn't just Stonehenge that suffered the ire of disappointed tourists - Los Angeles was also listed as a let-down for visitors.

Despite being home to some of the world’s most glamorous celebrities, some travellers were left shocked by what they labelled ‘a run-down, dangerous and dirty urban sprawl’

Despite being home to some of the world’s most glamorous celebrities, some travellers were left shocked by what they labelled ‘a run-down, dangerous and dirty urban sprawl’.

Many said it was ‘uninteresting’, claiming there was little to entertain visitors outside the well-known Walk of Fame on Hollywood Boulevard.

Another gripe was that great distances make it impossible to walk around, and that the public transport is poor, making much of the city inaccessible to non-drivers.

Another surprise addition to the list was The Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt, long considered one of the Seven Wonders of the World.

Travellers bemoaned that the Pyramids of Giza site ‘can be seen from Pizza Hut’, and are so close to the noise and chaos of the city

For over 3800 years, the Great Pyramid of Giza was the tallest man made structure in the world

Built between 2560–2540 BC, the monument is the oldest and largest of three pyramids in the Giza Necropolis.

Also known as the Pyramid of Khufu, it is the oldest of the Ancient Wonders of the World and the last one still largely intact.

For more than 3,800 years, the Great Pyramid of Giza was the tallest man made structure in the world.

However, travellers bemoaned the fact that the ancient site ‘can be seen from Pizza Hut’, and are so close to the noise and chaos of the city.

Many said they were constantly harassed by locals trying to sell them things, while another said it the inside of the central chamber ‘looked like a cow shed’.

Paris was branded the ‘worst city on Earth’ in the survey, with many criticising the rudeness of locals towards tourists.

Earlier this year Paris was named as the world’s most visited city attracting some 32.3 million people last year, with the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, and Notre-Dame Cathedral all huge draws

‘I couldn’t order a f***ing coffee, in English or in French, without a disdainful look from any cafe employee,’ said one vsiitor.

Other accusations levelled at the city were that it was overpriced and dirty.

Meanwhile, Venice was labelled as a ‘gigantic tourist trap’, by voters.

The floating city welcomes around 60,000 visitors each day, leading to crowded streets and overpriced food and drink.

‘The famed canals are horribly polluted and filled with garbage,’ said one visitor.

Others said it was crowded and full of scammers, and worth a weekend visit at most. ‘Disneyland for middle-aged American yuppies,’ said another.

Dubai also featured on the list, with travellers seemingly unhappy by the ‘overpriced, superficial, fake and unfriendly’ destination.

The giant malls and towering skyscrapers left many visitors complaining of a lack of culture, while the heat was also a major concern.

Many said they were bombarded by local vendors who were aggressive or hostile, and even said they felt physically threatened by opportunistic sellers.

The most frequent complaints were that the famed beaches were filthy, overcrowded and overrun with scammers.
