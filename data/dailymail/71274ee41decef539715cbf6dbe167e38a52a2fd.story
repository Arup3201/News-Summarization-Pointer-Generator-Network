Emma Stanfield, 40, a hospital radio DJ, walked free from court today

A female radio DJ who had sex with a 15-year-old girl after plying her with vodka has walked free from court because she did not know the teenager's real age.

Emma Stanfield, 40, said she thought the girl was 16 and only found out her true age the morning after the night they spent together at her Oxford apartment.

The prosecution claimed that Ms Stanfield knew the girl was underage and then 'recklessly' pursued her, leaving her 29 missed calls and more than 100 Facebook messages in the days that followed.

However, the jury instead believed the emotional DJ’s account and she was acquitted of three counts of sexual activity with a child and one of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity.

Ms Stanfield met the girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, on the afternoon of May 28 last year.

The DJ had stayed over at a friend’s house following a night out drinking in Oxford on May 27.

Her friend had left to go to work the following morning, leaving Ms Stanfield alone in the house with her friend’s 16-year-old daughter.

The jury heard Ms Stanfield and the young girl began drinking vodka and shared a kiss.

That girl then said she was not attracted to women but said her bisexual best friend was coming over soon.

Soon after she arrived, Ms Stanfield gave the girl vodka and straddled her on the sofa with her top off, kissing her.

The DJ claimed she thought the bisexual girl was also aged 16 years, but prosecutors said both girls had made her aware that she was only 15 at the time.

Ms Stanfield said the girl was 'very keen' after they had kissed and fondled on the sofa.

She then left to present her 4-7pm radio show on community radio station OX105FM.

She returned to the house after 7pm and the girl asked to go back to her flat in Chapel Street, Oxford, where they had sex that night.

Ms Stanfield told the court they had spoken about the girl’s age the next morning.

Ms Stanfield said in her evidence: 'We got up - it was quite early - and she said ‘there’s something I need to tell you.’

'She told me her real age. She told me she had lied and she was really 15.'

The DJ told the jury she felt 'awful' on hearing the revelation, adding: 'She then said, "let’s look it up, let’s see what you would get if the police found out."'

Emma Stanfield told Oxford Crown Court she thought the girl was 16 and only found out her true age the morning after the night they spent together at her Oxford apartment

Speaking after the verdicts, Ms Stanfield said the case was a 'very stressful' experience for her and she was looking forward to putting it behind her

Afterwards, Ms Stanfield said there was a 'bit of an atmosphere' and the girl left her home.

In the days that followed, Ms Stanfield sent the girl more than 100 Facebook messages, including asking her if she enjoyed oral sex.

'I really like you, I want you to know that and I would like you to be my girlfriend,' she wrote.

The jury at Oxford Crown Court took just over 90 minutes to return their verdicts after the three-day trial.

As the verdicts were read out, Ms Stanfield gave a huge sigh of relief and said 'thank you' to the jury.

She then rushed from the dock smiling and hugged a man who was in court supporting her.

Speaking 
after the verdicts, Ms Stanfield said the case was a 'very stressful' 
experience for her and she was looking forward to putting it behind her.

'I have had every confidence throughout the case that I would get the verdict that we have just had,' she said.

'It’s not a situation that I would want to repeat being in. I was in a very bad place last year to where I am now.

'It’s
 not very nice to have your private life displayed publicly before a 
huge amount of people, not just within the courtroom but within the 
Press.

'It has had a hugely damaging effect.'
