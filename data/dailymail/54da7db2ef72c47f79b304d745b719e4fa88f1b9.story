Hit TV show Game of Thrones has been lambasted by linguistic experts for its dodgy use of British accents.

Set in a world which could be described as half medieval, half Lord of the Rings, the award-wining fanatsy series has won a worldwide audience with its lavish production values.

The show's cast consists of predominantly British actors including well known faces like Sean Bean, Charles Dance and MacKenzie Crook as well as newcomers Emilia Clarke, Richard Madden, Kit Harington and Natalie Dormer.

And while the hotchpotch of regional accents on offer appear to have fallen on deaf ears in the U.S. they have begun to attract ridicule in the UK.  

In one terrible blunder four members of the same family - the Starks - are all heard speaking with different accents.

Producers on the show, which is set in an ancient kingdom based on early Europe, have hired a growing army of famous and forgotten UK acting talent.

Each episode enjoys a mammoth budget, similar to that of a Hollywood movie, but experts said they should have paid more attention to our diverse accents.

The show's creators splashed out on constructing new languages called Dothraki and Valerian for the exotic Eastern kingdoms, but have let the Brit accents run wild.

Professor Anthony Grant, Edge Hill 
University Historical Linguistics and Language expert said the mistakes 
are caused because Americans don't know any better.

He said: 'The accents on Game of Thrones are a complete mish-mash and it is the one big mistake they've made.

'Some actors are better at accents than others and it really shows on the show.

'They
 should have had a dialect coach on set to ensure all the accents were 
consistent - but the actors must have been told to 'sound as British as 
you can, just not American.'

'When these actors audition for a role, they must show their ability to perform with a range of accents.

'The
 American producers cannot hear the inconsistencies on the show's 
British accents as they tend to be wowed by British accents, no matter 
where they come from.

'Most of them haven't had much exposure to British brogues outside of the standard London or Home Counties accents.

'They
 can't distinguish between people's speech from Liverpool, Edinburgh and
 Sheffield - those accents will all sound the same to them.

'The producers thought we'll get British actors and have lovely British accents, but they got a lot more than they bargained for.

'They have spent a lot of money on constructing the new Dothraki and High Valerian languages and no doubt the regional accents have come second to this.

'As long as it sounds exotic to them, the producers will be happy.

'It would be impossible for members of the same family, like the Starks, to have different accents unless one had been sent to live the other side of the country.

'It's more like a representation of life today where people travel and have partners from elsewhere.'

Dr Dominic Watt, Senior Lecturer in Forensic Speech Science at York University added: 'TV producers use regional accents as a shorthand for creating characters.

'Stereotypes born out of accents are a method of giving the audience a quick way to indentify their backgrounds - but they're out of place in this context.'

A HBO spokesman for Game of Thrones said the producers of the show 'declined to comment.'

It isn't the first time an American production has been slammed for its misunderstanding of British accents.

After starring in the 2010 production of Robin Hood, Hollywood hot head Russell Crowe famously stormed out of an interview with BBC Radio 4 after being accused of making the hero of Sherwood Forest sound a trifle Irish.
