Lance Bombardier Aydn Walster, 22, impersonated a police officer by pulling motorists over using flashing lights he bought on eBay

A soldier impersonated a police officer by using flashing lights he bought on eBay to pull motorists over and tell them their driving 'was not up to standard'.

Lance Bombardier Aydn Walster, 22, pulled over unsuspecting drivers he thought were driving poorly before taking down their personal details in a notebook.

The soldier even asked drivers to get back into the back of his Saab 9-3 saloon car to give them a telling off.

Walster appeared at Lincoln Magistrates' Court yesterday where his defence solicitor admitted the serviceman had been a 'bloody fool'. 

He pleaded guilty to three counts of impersonating a police officer and two charges of using a car fitted with a blue flashing warning light. 

Walster, from Lincoln, was fined £835, ordered to pay costs of £85, and a victim surcharge of £84.

The soldier, who has served in Afghanistan, now faces being kicked out of the Army as a result of his criminal conviction.

The court heard Walster bought the blue flashing lights on eBay before putting them on the dashboard of his car and pulling over fellow soldiers at his barracks as a prank.

But he then took the joke 'too far' by going on to public roads in Lincoln and stopping three members of the public between November last year and January.

The soldier pulled over motorists who he thought were driving poorly before telling them they had been breaking the speed limit.

Walster was caught when on January 22 he pulled over a car at Lindis Retail Park before taking their personal details. 

But a friend driving behind became suspicious and reported the incident to the police.

Prosecutor Iola Harris said: 'On each occasion, it seems to be that he believed the manner of driving was not up to standard.'

Ms Harris added: 'A motorist was followed on Tritton Road by a car with a flashing blue light. The defendant asked him to sit in the back of his car and he was asked questions.

'As a result of the investigation, the defendant was arrested and in his vehicle was a notebook containing personal details.

'He accepted that book belonged to him and he did take names and addresses of members of the public.'

While being interviewed by police, Walster admitted he had impersonated a police officer on another occasion.

His defence lawyer told the court that being arrested had been more terrifying for Walster than his tour of Afghanistan.

Dave Clapham, defending, said: 'In essence, what he says is that the lights were bought off eBay and used to stop his mates on the barracks as a joke.

'For whatever reason this continued into the public arena. He does not know why. He just says he has been a bloody fool and completely stupid.

'He tells me the process of being arrested was more terrifying than his tour of Afghanistan.

'The consequences of your sentence have ramifications that could go far higher. Not only could he be overlooked for promotions bonuses, he could face a reduction in rank - ultimately it could lead to his discharge. He is a good soldier.'

After the case, PC Robert McGhee, from Lincolnshire Police, said: 'Offences of this type are really very serious.

'Police officers are trained to the highest of standards and the job they carry out every day requires not only application of that training but a thorough knowledge of the law, as well as practice and procedure. Impersonating an officer carries hefty penalties for good reason.

'We are pleased with the outcome of the court case as it is a fitting sentence. We hope this serves as a stark warning to not only the gentleman involved but also to others that police and the courts take a very dim view of anyone acting in this fashion.'

An Army spokesperson said: 'All those who are found to fall short of the Army's high standards are dealt with as appropriate through the discipline process, up to and including discharge.'
