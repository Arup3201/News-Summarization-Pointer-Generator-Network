Gruesome: Richard Henderson said Jason Martin chomped on his genitals 'like a sandwich' and left him bleeding and in excruciating pain. He needed stitches both inside and outside his penis. File picture

A man bit his neighbour's penis until it bled in a row over loud music, a court has heard.

Jason Martin, 41, is alleged to have bent over and bitten Richard Henderson, 39, through his pyjamas after receiving a text message asking him to turn his music down.

Mr Henderson, 39, said Martin, of Dover, Kent, bit down on his genitals ‘like a sandwich’ and left him in excruciating pain and needing stitches.

Asked to describe the attack Mr Henderson told a jury: 'My willy was not attached to the rest of my body.

'I have never experienced that kind of pain to this day and I don’t want to experience it ever again.'

Police called to the scene found Martin 'with blood over his mouth'.

But the accused denied biting his neighbour and allegedly said: 'How could I bite him... I have no teeth?'

Photographs of the injury were shown to the jury at Canterbury Crown Court after they were warned 'they don’t make pleasant viewing'.

Martin denies wounding Mr Henderson with intent to cause him serious harm in the row in June last year.

Prosecutor Mary Jacobson said the attack happened when Mr Henderson and his partner Michelle Hilton grew annoyed at the late night music from Martin’s flat next door.

She said: 'The two men both lived with
 their families in the block of flats. Martin’s flat is on the ground 
floor and to one side of a flat where the Hendersons lived.

'On
 the evening of June 23, Mr Henderson’s partner Michelle Hilton sent a 
text to the defendant complaining about the volume of the music coming 
from the flat.'

She claimed that Martin then went to his neighbour’s flat 'to confront him' about the text and pyjama-clad Mr Henderson opened the door.

She added: 'A verbal altercation 
ensued, which culminated in the defendant reaching around Mr Henderson’s
 back with one hand and grabbing him by the crotch - his penis and 
testicles - with the other hand and then pulling Mr Henderson out of his
 doorway.

'Once out of the flat a scuffle ensued during which the defendant pushed Mr Henderson against a wall, stooped down and bit into and gnawed at, Mr Henderson’s penis.'

She told the jury that the victim screamed out in pain as Ms Hilton began shouting for help.

The prosecutor added: 'A female neighbour came out and saw the defendant with his face at Mr Henderson’s crotch and tried without success to pull the defendant off him.

'A male friend of the neighbour then also came out and managed to pull Martin away as Mr Henderson shouted: 'He’s bitten me!' and blood could be seen in Mr Henderson’s crotch area.

Martin allegedly told police he had been attacked after the two had argued over the music and he had grabbed Mr Henderson’s penis in self-defence.

Martin denied biting Mr. Henderson's penis and told the jury: 'I've only got a couple of teeth in the lower part of my mouth...I can't even bite into a hard-boiled egg.

'I am not homosexual and there is no way I would put a man's penis in my mouth. Even the thought of it makes me sick.'

But he admitted grabbing his neighbour's 'bits and bobs' to defend himself during the scrap.

Martin, who denies wounding with intent, claimed he was punched first and then held in a headlock before being kicked.

He claimed the blood around his mouth came from a 'fat lip' he suffered from a punch and not from the penis.

Martin said he went to his neighbour's flat because he thought the complaint was unfair and was grabbed by Mr Henderson who tried to ram his head into a metal staircase.

Sobbing in the witness box, he said: 'I had just grabbed around him (Mr Henderson), I didn't realise at the time that I had done anything to him.

'I just grabbed into an area, I didn't realise at the time it was his testicles.'

Judge Adele Williams asked: 'You must have felt his penis and testicles in your hand?'

Martin replied: 'I didn't know if it was his penis or his testicles or his upper leg or arm. I didn't know what it was. I was just getting beaten up and I was scared.'

'Now I know what happened, I can't be any more sorry for Mr Henderson.'

The trial continues.
