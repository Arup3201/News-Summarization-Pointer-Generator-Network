Melbourne is not only the most liveable city in the world but it also has Australia's number one restaurant.

Attica, run by chef Ben Shewry, was named as the country's best restaurant while Martin Benn, of Sydney's Sepia restaurant and wine bar, was crowned the peer-voted chef of the year.

The Melbourne restaurant and Sydney chef were among Australia's culinary finest awarded at this year's annual Gourmet Traveller awards.

Both chefs run the multi-award winning restaurants priding themselves in modern Australia cuisine with their own unique twist.

Sepia has a contemporary menu, which dishes up the best seasonal produce and draws inspiration from Japan.

Attica is one of Melbourne's premium fine dining restaurants, which offers carefully crafted meals with earthy tones.

New Zealand-born Shewry took to social media upon receiving the prestigious award to express his gratitude.

'This is 100 per cent possible because of the amazing team of talented, smart, hardworking and above all kind people that make Attica what it is, you inspire me daily,' he wrote.

'My beautiful wife Natalia is also a major stakeholder in this, all of the trust she put in me and the many sacrifices she has made and continues to make to allow me to follow a crazy dream.

'Love what you do with all your heart. Passion need not have an end.'

Attica may be deep in the Melbourne suburb of Ripponlea, south-east of Melbourne but it's Australia's culinary standard-bearer on the world stage, said Gourmet Traveller chief restaurant critic Pat Nourse.

Diners are taken on a voyage of deliciousness at Attica, said Mr Nourse.
