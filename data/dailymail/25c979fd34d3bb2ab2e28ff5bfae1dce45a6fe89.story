Germany may have emerged victorious at the World Cup, but Joachim Low wasn't the only manager who watched his players shine in Brazil.

Poster-boy Neymar enjoyed a fine tournament before injury struck, Arjen Robben tormented opposition defences in the orange of Holland and Giancarlo Gonzalez helped Costa Rica prove their credentials on the biggest stage.

With the final whistle having been blown at the Maracana, Sportsmail picks its team of the tournament.

MANUEL NEUER (Germany)

Could have turned up with one hand tied behind his back and still probably kept out most teams at this World Cup. A formidable goalkeeper for a formidable team.

Safe hands: Manuel Neuer kept Argentina out at the Maracana to help seal World Cup victory for Germany

PHILIPP LAHM (Germany)

Lifting the trophy was a fitting climax to the tournament for Lahm. Excelled in his more natural role at right-back, but did we expect anything less?

VIDEO All Star XI: Philip Lahm highlights

GIANCARLO GONZALEZ (Costa Rica)

A towering figure at the back who did more than any other Costa Rican player to ensure that the underdogs only conceded two goals in five games.

MATS HUMMELS (Germany)

Inspirational in the quarter-final win over France, Hummels confirmed his reputation as one of the best central defenders in world football.

Magic moment: Mats Hummels celebrates scoring the winning goal against France in the quarter-finals

DALEY BLIND (Holland)

Defended well and put in some wonderful balls from the left for the Dutch. Capped it off with a goal in the Third Place Playoff.

JAVIER MASCHERANO (Argentina)

A rock at the heart of Argentina’s run to the World Cup final, Mascherano was one player who didn’t deserve to be on the losing side at the Maracana.

BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER (Germany)

Just edges out teammate Toni Kroos based on his performance in the final. Those last 10 minutes were like a scene from Rocky.

Driving force: Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger takes a breather after lifting the World Cup

ARJEN ROBBEN (Holland)

The Dutchman seems to get faster with age. Too late to cut out the diving now, but there was no-one more dangerous when in possession.

Wing wizard: Holland forward Arjen Robben tormented defenders during his country's run to the semi-finals

NEYMAR (Brazil)

The poster boy of Brazil 2014 handled the intense pressure remarkably well with four goals in five games before he was kicked out of the World Cup, and Brazil duly followed.

Talisman: Brazil forward Neymar managed four goals in five games before breaking a bone in his back 

JAMES RODRIGUEZ (Colombia)

Outstanding player who scored arguably the outstanding goal of the tournament. Energy and verve a joy to watch until he came up against Brazil’s hatchet men.

Danger man: Colombia's James Rodriguez managed to score six goals in Brazil - more than any other player

THOMAS MULLER (Germany)

Is he a false 9, false 10 or a false something else? While we debated the point, Muller put on No 13 and scored five goals for the second World Cup in a row.

More to come: Thomas Muller scored five goals at the World Cup for the second consecutive tournament
