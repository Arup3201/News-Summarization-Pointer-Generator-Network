Manchester City have failed to win a Premier League game without Yaya Toure since April last year following the weekend draw with Everton.

And the bad news for City boss Manuel Pellegrini is that he could be without his talisman until they face Newcastle on February 21 as Toure takes part in the Africa Cup of Nations with Ivory Coast.

City's failure to win without the midfield powerhouse will be of grave concern for Pellegrini in this crucial month in the race for the title.

City have back-to-back Premier League games against Arsenal and league leaders Chelsea either side of an FA Cup clash with Middlesbrough in the next three weeks.

Toure was criticised earlier in the season after a dip in his typically exceptional form but the former Barcelona midfielder has since returned to his best, coinciding with a seven-game winning streak in the Premier League as City clawed back an eight point deficit on Chelsea. 

Manchester City have won nine of their last 11 league games and Toure was absent in the two matches that they failed to get the maximum - the 1-1 draw with Everton and the clash with Burnley on December 28 when City threw away a two-goal lead to draw 2-2.

During that impressive run, Toure was instrumental as he scored six goals in eight games to help fire City to within touching distance of Jose Mourinho's side.

Toure was present in four games that City have failed to win this season, including a defeat by Stoke and the draw with Chelsea at the Etihad in September.

Should Ivory Coast reach the final of the tournament in Equatorial Guinea, Toure could miss five matches for City in what could prove a decisive month in determining the destination of the Premier League crown come May.
