A 39-stone man has left his flat for the first time in three years after firefighters carried him out on a bed sheet.

Hang Hang, 20, was unable to leave his flat in Shenyang, Liaoning Province, because of his size.

The man, who lives on a diet of sugary foods such as pancakes, left the building for the first time in three years today - thanks to the help of Chinese firefighters.

Heavy load: Nine firefighters came to the assistance of Hang Hang, 20, today - lifting the 39 stone man out of his apartment on a bed sheet, pictured. He hadn't left the building in three years because of his size

Easy does it: The firefighters struggle to lift the man - who was 23 stone by the age of 17 - down the stairs of his apartment. His mother says he will eat a stack of pancakes, a big bowl of porridge and vegetables in one sitting

In order to get him outside, Hang was carried on a thick bed sheet down the stairs by 9 firefighters.

Following the success of the tricky maneuver, the man sat outside on a specially reinforced bed enjoying fresh air for the first time in 36 months.

The 'rescue' was organised by a local newspaper - who campaigned for people to help him leave the house so he could enjoy some fresh air.

Hang's mother told Chinese media her son had always struggles with his weight and tipped the scales at 23 stone by the ages of 17.

However, after moving in with his mother three years ago, his weight ballooned and he went from 23 stone to 39 stone - leaving him trapped inside the flat.

She told reporters: 'For one meal, he at least eats 10 pancakes, one large bowel of porridge, and vegetables.'

Outside: Hang Hang is propped up by the men once they managed to get him out of the building. The 'rescue' was organised by a local newspaper - which campaigned for people to help the man get out in to the fresh air

Last month, a Mexican man once listed as the world's heaviest human died at the age of 48.

Manuel Uribe weight 87 stone at the height of his obesity - and spent most of his final decade bed-ridden on a reinforced mattress.

Uribe had 'slimmed down' to about 61 stones after he was awarded the title of world's fattest human by the Guinness World Record's in 2006.

When he died, his body - lying on the same bed - was taken to the Serorrey funeral home in Monterry, Mexico aboard a flat-bed truck.

Funeral home director Pedro Reyes said Serorrey's cremation facility was the only one in the northern city of Monterrey able to handle Uribe's body.
