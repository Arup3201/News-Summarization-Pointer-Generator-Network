What started as a peaceful protest against the Albuquerque Police Department quickly turned violent by nightfall with officers in riot gear breaking out the tear gas.

At least 500 people gathered on the steps of the Albuquerque Police department on Sunday to condemn the recent police killing of 38-year-old James Boyd. Earlier this week hacktivist group Anonymous posted a video online calling for locals to occupy police headquarters and take a stand against Boyd's 'cold blooded' murder.

'Let them know that your city is not a place for war games against the homeless and the less fortunate,' the group said in the video.

While there were no reports of injuries or arrests in the early hours of the protest, things took a turn as night fell with police using tear gas on the group and making arrests.

The protest started around noon today, with hundreds gathering outside of police headquarters in downtown Albuquerque.

Justified? James Boyd was killed March 16 after a stand-off with police in the Albuquerque foothills where he was camped out

'Hey hey! Ho ho! Killer cops have got to go!' the protesters, wearing Guy Fawkes' masks, chanted.

The masks have become a rallying symbol for Anonymous, which also seems to have hacked into the APD website today - causing it to shutdown from morning until at least 4:30pm.

A Twitter account claiming to be connected to the organization tweeted a list of APD officers phone numbers.A police spokesman could not confirm whether the numbers were authentic.

While police showed up with batons and riot gear, the demonstration remained peaceful with protesters marching between APD headquarters, Civic Plaza and the University of New Mexico campus for several hours.

Police even shut down a street to make sure none of the protesters were injured in traffic.

But things took a turn about eight hours into the protest when the demonstrators started vandalizing property, with one person trying to take down a street sign, others spray-painting property and a group trying to push over a police cruiser.

When the protest returned to APD headquarters officers warned the crowd to clear the area since it was an unlawful protest.

But the protesters said they wouldn't stop until the police chief is fired, prompting police to release at least a dozen tear gas canisters on the group gathered on Central Ave around 9:30pm.

There were reports of several people being arrested and taken away in police cruisers.

At least one police officer was injured in the protest, and another was isolated in his car while a group of protesters tried to break the windows.

Locals are being told to avoid the area while residents at the University of New Mexico are sheltering in their dorms.

State Senator Joseph Cervantes tweeted that his daughter was in one of the UNM dorms impacted by the tear gas.

'We respected their rights to protest obviously,' Mayor Richard Berry said, 'but what it appears we have at this time is individuals who weren’t connected necessarily with the original protest … they’ve taken it far beyond a normal protest.'

The protesters were marching in 
response to the March 16 police killing of Boyd, 38, who was found 
camped out in the hills surrounding Albuquerque.

Lapel
 camera footage released by the APD shows half a dozen officers standing
 20 feet away from the man shouting 'get on the ground' and 'drop the 
knife!' before shooting unloaded beanbags, stun guns and live rounds on 
him.

Boyd, who police say had a lengthy criminal record, later died.

Shooters: APD Officers Keith Sandy (left) and Dominique Perez (right) were placed on leave following Boyd's killing

Officers Keith Sandy and Dominique Perez have been placed on leave since the incident.

But Albuquerque Police Chief Gorden Eden said in a press conference that he thought his officers' actions were justified.

‘The officers were attempting to affect a felony arrest using less-than lethal weapons, including a distractive device, K9, and a Taser shotgun,’ Eden said.

Authorities said Boyd threatened to kill a Crisis Intervention Team officer called to the scene.

When Boyd refused to follow police orders and an unarmed K9 officer got close to him, officers Keith Sandy and Dominique Perez shot toward Boyd, Eden said.

The video footage shows an injured Boyd with two five-inch knives in his hand when officers surround and handcuff him.

Police in Albuquerque are facing intense criticism after video footage was released which appears to show officers using excessive force to apprehend James Boyd, a homeless man who was holding two knives

Two police officers each fired three bullets causing Boyd to fall to the ground. A medical examiner has not yet determined if the bullets killed Boyd

‘The suspect did in fact make a decision not to follow the directions that (were) provided to him by the officers,’ Eden said.

‘On many occasions he said that he was not going to come off that mountain.’

However, Boyd's death is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to police killings in the New Mexico capital.

The U.S. Justice Department has been investigating the Albuquerque police for a year, following reports of  more than three dozen police shootings since 2010.

‘We need to look at some changes within the department, but I think more importantly we need to restore confidence in the Albuquerque police department,’ said City Council President Ken Sanchez.

State Senator Michael Padilla said he was responding to worried constituents.

He says he was disturbed not only by the video, but by APD Police Chief Gorden Eden’s comments that the shooting was justified.

‘I'm very concerned about the chief of police immediately jumping to conclusions,’ Padilla said.

‘I think we all know with camera on the lapel video - something definitely happened.’

Sanchez said he was concerned about how the public now sees the APD.

‘We need to work hard to restore confidence in the men and women who work for the Albuquerque Police Department,’ he told KOB4.
