Shocked: Uma Rupanya, wife of Richard de Wit who has been accused of murdering British backpacker Sarah Groves in India

The wife of the Dutch tourist accused of murdering a British backpacker in India yesterday told how her children had asked her: ‘Why has daddy killed that woman?’

Thai bride Uma Rupanya said her husband of ten years, Richard de Wit, had become increasingly paranoid and psychotic before abandoning the family six months ago to go travelling.

The first she learned of her husband’s alleged crime was when Dutch officers arrived to tell her that de Wit, 43, had confessed to the murder of former public schoolgirl Sarah Groves, 24, on a houseboat.

Miss Groves, a fitness instructor from Guernsey, was stabbed 45 times in a frenzied 15-minute knife attack at Lake Dal, near Kashmir’s capital Srinagar.

Yesterday Miss Rupanya, who is blind in one eye and suffers from multiple sclerosis, said she does not know what to say to her two daughters, aged 12 and ten.

‘I want to protect them but don’t know how,’ she said.

Jobless de Wit, said to be 7ft tall, fled the murder scene in a stolen rowing boat, which capsized before he swam to shore.

He was arrested by police, dripping wet, with £2,000 stuffed in his underwear and wearing no shoes, 50 miles away.

According to Indian police, he later said he murdered Miss Groves after being taken over by the devil.

Yesterday, Miss Rupanya, 31, said she was in a state of shock and felt immense sorrow for Miss Groves’s family. She told the Daily Mail: ‘My husband left us in November. He was seeing a psychiatrist but had become increasingly irrational and paranoid.

‘He believed the Government was out to get him, that spies were following him, that the house was bugged.

‘He had stopped taking his anti-psychotic medication also.

'He said he had to leave for his and our safety. I was very worried about him but never expected something like this to happen.

‘It’s
just so awful. He was a good father to our children, he was never 
violent towards me and he did not take drugs, although I have heard that
he started to smoke cannabis after he left us.

‘I feel angry as he left me with a few thousands euros to live on, he knew I couldn’t work or provide for the children myself because of my disability.

'I just have to try to be strong and be a good mother the best I can but it is a very dark time for us.

‘My children are very angry too. They 
ask me “why has daddy killed that woman?” I don’t know what to say. I 
want to protect them but don’t know how.’

De
Wit, a former councillor for an extreme right-wing party in his home 
town of Ridderkerk, met his wife while on holiday in Thailand 13 years 
ago when he went into her brother’s clothes shop where she worked as a 
sales assistant.

They had their two daughters before 
marrying in November 2002.  At the time, Miss Rupanya was seriously ill 
after giving birth to their second child so the ceremony took place from
her hospital bed in Rotterdam’s Erasmus Hospital.

Speaking from the tiny apartment they shared together in the town of Capelle aan den Ijssel, she said: ‘Richard never worked. He stayed at home and played on the computer.

'At the weekend he would take our children to the museum.

‘After he left us, he would phone and email to see how we were. But I felt very let down.

‘The last time I spoke to him was two days before the murder. He seemed OK and said he was enjoying India. I still can’t believe this has happened.’

De Wit, who has two children from a previous relationship, posted a rambling video online shortly before he left for India detailing his delusional fears that the Dutch authorities were after him and were trying to frame him for a fictitious bomb plot.

He remains in custody in India.
