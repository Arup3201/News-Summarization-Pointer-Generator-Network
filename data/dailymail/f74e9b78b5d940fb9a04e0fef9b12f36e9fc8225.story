Waste of talent: Emily McCaughan, 22, who wanted to be a doctor, died after falling 20 floors at Circus Circus hotel in Las Vegas

An aspiring doctor fell to her death from a Las Vegas hotel after having drug-induced hallucinations at a music festival. 

Emily McCaughan, 22, who attended the University of Arizona, died last week after 
falling from her room on the 27th floor to a third-floor roof.

Family members said that the young woman had suffered paranoid delusions after taking ecstasy at the 
three-day Electric Daisy Carnival - a festival which drew 320,000 people before ending last
Monday morning.

The family spokesman Mignonne Walstad told the Las Vegas Review-Journal: 'Damn it, they [drugs] are just killers every 
single time.

'Emily wasn’t a drug addict, it was just a tragic accident.'

Her friends told the paper she had become distressed after taking the drug on Sunday evening.

She had believed that a 'man was following her' and wanted to go back to the hotel on the Vegas strip, so her friends put her in a passing cab.

Back at the hotel, the 22-year-old sent a series of Facebook messages asking for help.

When her friends returned later she had disappeared. 

Her body was found after it was believed she had squeezed between the window bars of her hotel room.

Her death was confirmed by the medical examiner on Friday after Las Vegas police decided not to make it public at the time.

Miss McCaughan’s father, Richard, said he could not believe his daughter would have used drugs and suspected foul play.

He said his daughter had been inspired to go to medical school by her grandfather who was a doctor during the Korean War. The family live in Scottsdale, Arizona but are originally from Lake Stevens, Washington.

Friends and family held a 
'celebration of her life' on Saturday. She leaves her parents, Richard 
and Jaci, along with two brothers Justin and Ryan and an older sister 
Megan.

On Facebook, the young woman listed 
her interests as dance and snowboarding. Her father told the 
Review-Journal that she had planned to go to Thailand this summer to do 
charity work.

A man also died after attending the 
Electric Daisy Carnival last weekend. The 31-year-old party-goer died on 
Saturday after he was hit by a truck early last 
Monday morning.

The Florida man, who has not yet been identified, has been drinking, friends said.

The Clark County coroner’s office had not
yet announced a cause of death for Miss McCaughan and police were 
still investigating the circumstances of her fall.

Erika Raney, spokeswoman for Electric Daisy Carnival producer 
Insomniac, said her company goes out of its way to provide ample 
security and medical personnel, and was not responsible for the deaths.

She said: 'We are deeply saddened by the two tragedies that occurred last week
in Las Vegas outside Electric Daisy Carnival.

'The two tragedies occurred beyond the festival’s walls as well as 
beyond Insomniac’s control and these incidents will not threaten the 
future of EDC in Las Vegas.'

Ms Raney
said all Insomniac festivals have a zero-tolerance policy against drugs
and a strictly enforced policy barring those under the age of 18 from 
entering.

'It is a known fact that individuals who choose to 
partake in illicit drug behavior may suffer unexpected tragic 
consequences,' she said.

'We hope that our fans carefully consider the 
decisions they make and how those decisions impact their own safety and 
the well-being of those around them.'

The Florida man struck by 
the truck was within the care of two trauma doctors within minutes of 
the accident, she said, a response time otherwise unheard of had he not 
been in close proximity of the festival and its medical staff.

Ms Raney added: 'Electric Daisy Festival, in many respects, is one of the safest places 
to be in Las Vegas during the event weekend’s operating hours.

'With law enforcement, private security teams, and fully staffed 
medical facilities housing doctors, nurses and emergency medical 
personnel, the venue functions like a small city.'

The deaths are the latest in a string of fatalities linked to the festival.

The
rave was shunned in Los Angeles in 2010 following a 15-year-old girl’s 
fatal drug overdose. That party also resulted in more than 226 people 
receiving emergency medical treatment and 114 arrests for misconduct, 
drug possession and other charges.

Party time: The carnival is the largest electronic dance party in the U.S. but has been linked to several fatalities over the years

Last year, a Texas teenager died during an Electric Daisy Carnival in Dallas plagued by drug arrests.

Despite the festival’s troubled past, Las Vegas has warmly welcomed the Electric Daisy Carnival since it moved there last year.

Arrest and medical call totals for the latest festival in Las Vegas haven’t been released.

The
Electric Daisy Carnival is the largest electronic music party in the 
United States, complete with a towering ferris wheel, amusement park 
rides and celebrity DJs.
