Reid, 41, claimed in a new letter that it was part of God's plan for his attempted bombing of a passenger jet in 2001 to fail 

Failed shoe-bomber Richard Reid has claimed that God wanted him to bungle his attempt to blow up a transatlantic flight soon after 9/11.

Reid, 41, recently replied to a letter from a researcher of Islamic terrorism in which he said that it was not in God's plan for him to die in 2001 - or the other 197 passengers on American Airlines Flight 63.

Reid also said he believed his attempted act of terrorism would be permitted by Islamic law. 

In a letter, shown this week to NBC, he wrote: 'However, at the same time I also believe that it wasn't supposed to happen, not because it was displeasing to God … rather because it was not either my time to die nor that of those on the plane with me, and he had other plans for me which include my staying in prison and other matters which I may not be aware of as of yet.'

In a separate letter, Reid said that he did not see the terrorist attacks at the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo as a tragedy because the victims 'insulted Islam'.  

He also wrote to Dr Kimberly Mehlman-Orozco that although he had 'tactical regrets', he does not regret losing his freedom. 

British-born Reid is serving life without parole at a supermax prison in Colorado known as 'the Alcatraz of the Rockies'.

He was jailed in 2003 after he attempted to detonate explosives hidden in his trainers on a Paris to Miami flight on December 22, 2001.

Passengers on board the flight from Paris to Miami on December 22, 2001 were pictured subduing attempted shoe-bomber Richard Reid 

During his trial, he told the court that he was an enemy of the U.S. and 'a soldier of Allah'. 

The court heard how passengers complained of smoke in the cabin shortly after an in-flight meal. 

Reid was discovered sitting alone trying to light a match, where flight attendants told him smoking was forbidden.

He promised to stop but, a few minutes later, the attendant saw him hunched over in his seat holding one of his shoes which had a fuse leading into it.

The attendant called for help and passengers stepped in to subdue the 6ft 4in terrorist by binding him with plastic handcuffs, seatbelt extensions and headphone cords.

A doctor on board sedated Reid with a tranquilizer he found in the plane's emergency medical kit. The flight was diverted to Logan International Airport in Boston.

Tests on the explosives later revealed that Reid, who had been denied access to a flight 24 hours earlier because of his agitated behaviour, had been walking in rainy weather which had caused the fuse to be too damp to ignite.

His attempted bombing led to heightened security at airports across the world, with all airline passengers departing from the U.S. now having to pass through airport security in socks or bare feet while their shoes are scanned.

Other countries choose passengers at random to undergo the screening.

Dr Mehlman-Orozco is director of a non-profit organization known as The Justitia Institute which examines issues of immigration and social justice along with the radicalization of extremists. 

She explained in an interview that having spoken to convicted terrorists, including Reid and 'Jihadi Jane' Colleen LaRose, the common factor was not a hatred for Americans but 'an extreme love for their God and obedience for the jihadist who recruited them'.
