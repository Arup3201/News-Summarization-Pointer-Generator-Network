Child abuse charges: Shandi Garrison, 27, was arrested early Monday after allegedly attacking her 8-year-old daughter in Jenks, Oklahoma

A 27-year-old mother and aspiring model in Jenks, Oklahoma was arrested early Monday after allegedly attacking her 8-year-old daughter.

Police were called to Shandi Garrison's home in a trailer park on the south side of town around 10:30pm Sunday where they found her daughter hiding under the back porch saying, 'Please don't kill me'.

The mother appeared to be drunk since she smelled of alcohol, had watery eyes and was unsteady on her feet, police said.

According to the girl's step-father, Garrison had come home, started drinking and became belligerent.

The 8-year-old girl told paramedics that her mother chased her around the home, pulled her hair and threatened her with more harm before the girl went to find a place to hide.

When police arrived on the scene, Garrison accused the step-father of molesting her daughter, and the man denied the allegations.

He told police that he had to intervene to keep his drunk wife from hurting her child.

Garrison was booked in Tulsa County Jail early Monday on charges of child abuse and public intoxication.

In her mugshot, Garrison looked exhausted and had what appeared to be a black eye. The mugshot provides quite a contrast to Garrisno's photos on Myspace, which show a happier and healthier woman. At one time, Garrison was an aspiring model and actress, according to her listing on ExploreTalent.com.

She was last reported still in custody in lieu of $50,100 bond.

The girl has since been placed int eh care of her grandmother.Â
