Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert has revealed that a move for Manchester United midfielder Tom Cleverley has not progressed.

Lambert, speaking following Villa's impressive 2-1 win over Hull City, was honest in admitting that Cleverley is no nearer to joining the West Midlands side.

'There’s no update on that at the minute to be honest. He’s still Man Utd’s player. There’s nothing went forward on that,' Lambert revealed.

The Scot went on to confirm that Karim El Ahmadi is close to sealing a move back to former club Feyenoord.

'El Ahmadi looks like he's going to sign for Feyenoord. He's been great for me since he's been here. It's a chance for him to go back, he's in his last year. 

'We'd obviously lose him in the African Nations Cup so it'd make sense going back home. If we can do one or two lads to come in, then I'd look to do it.'

Away from the transfer window, Lambert believes owner Randy Lerner's honesty over his desire to sell the club has contributed to their best Barclays Premier League start in eight years.

Villa's 2-1 win over Hull, a scoreline that does not quite do justice to their dominance for the first hour, took them to seven points from a possible nine heading to the international break.

That is their best opening three-game return since 2006/07 and a far cry from the embattled atmosphere that shrouded the club towards the end of last season.

Some expected another year of struggle after American businessman Lerner put the club on the market in the summer, a move that has yet to lead to any concrete interest, but Lambert feels the transparency has helped everyone.

'I think what has helped is the chairman coming out and saying what he said,' explained the Scot.

'That's given people a clear picture of what is happening.

'Everybody knows the situation with the football club now, the way it is, it's out there.

'The chairman's being great, he's done everything he can here.

Gaffer: Lambert is very happy with the start that his side have made this season

'The crowd have galvanised as well. They've realised if they stick with it and get right behind it I'm pretty sure we'll win more than not.'

Villa endured a slightly nervy finale against Hull as Nikica Jelavic's deflected header halved a two-goal deficit created by the electric Gabriel Agbonlahor and Andreas Weimann inside 36 minutes.

The hosts should have been home and dry by the hour mark, but saw Fabian Delph and Ashley Westwood denied by the woodwork.

Lambert, whose side were dire at home last season, was content to focus on the positives of Villa's early dominance.

'I thought in the first half we were outstanding. If we'd scored another couple I don't think anyone could have begrudged us that and that would have made the second half a little more easy,' Lambert said.

'Gaby, especially in the first half, was unplayable today. Excellent.

'The movement of the midfield was terrific, the passing was so sharp, our willingness to go and win the game was excellent.'
