A beggar sits on the side of a bustling Indian road, his enormous swollen leg resting on a mat in front of him.

Sahajul Sheikh, 46, suffers from Elephantiasis - a rare disease that causes parts of the body, usually arms or legs, to swell to abnormally large proportions.

Charity: He says he earns up to £300 a month by begging in Kashmir during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan - in which it is mandatory for the Muslims to pay alms

It often leaves sufferers incapacitated as their painful and swollen limbs are incredibly difficult to move. This leaves many with the condition struggling to work.

The disfiguring condition has left Mr Sheikh's right leg so severely swollen below the knee that he is forced to wear shorts.

He also has smaller hardened lumps and growths across his face and arms.

Mr Sheikh, from the eastern Indian state of West Bengal, spends his days begging on the streets of Srinagar, the summer capital of Indian-administered Kashmir, India.

He says he earns up to £300 (30,000 INR) a month by begging in Kashmir during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan - in which it is mandatory for the Muslims to pay alms to those poorer and less fortunate than themselves.

Elephant Man: A portrait of Joseph Merrick

Born in 1862, Joseph Merrick began growing disfiguring tumours before the age of two.

He suffered from Proteus syndrome and had growths all over his body - especially on his head.

His skin appeared thick and lumpy, he developed an enlargement of his lips, and a bony lump grew on his forehead.

Merrick's painful condition and subsequent health problems made it difficult for keep any sort of job.

Poverty eventually forced him to enter the Leicester union workhouse.

Desperate to find a way out of such grim conditions, Merrick contacted the owner of a Leicester music hall in 1884.

Together, they established an act called 'The Elephant Man'.

As The Elephant Man, Merrick earned a living working in freak shows and circuses in the 19th century, where he was often abused by members of the public.

Merrick died on 11 April 1890, aged 27.

In 1979, Bernard Pomerance's play about Merrick called The Elephant Man debuted.

David Lynch released his film of the same name the following year.
