It is every petrol-head’s dream to drive a fleet of luxury motor cars.

But for Jeremy Clarkson and his Top Gear co-hosts it is just another day in the office.

Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May were captured filming an episode of Top Gear in central London today.

The trio drove three red, white and blue new Jaguars down the historic Mall.

Huge Union flags billowed from the back of the cars as they drove.

At one point the Household Cavalry even passed through the set.

Clarkson is also pictured driving his own invention, a one person hybrid car that he named P45 in the last series.

They had gathered £200million of great British cars for today's filming, including an ice cream van

They had a variety of cars, including classic racing cars and army vehicles

There was also a mock-up of the British-made Bloodhound, a super sonic car that is hoped to break the land speed record

The team also managed to trace a 1959 Le Mans winning Aston Martin DBR1

Also on display was the British made Bloodhound, a supersonic car that is hoped to break the land speed record.

Clarkson was also driving the P45, a miniature hybrid car that he invented last series.

It has a 100cc engine based on a quadbike, and looks like he is driving inside a robot.

He named it after the Peel P50 – the world’s smallest ever road-legal production car – by calling it the P45, as it is slightly smaller.

A crowd quickly gathered to look at the cars as much as their famous drivers.

The trio were pictured laughing in between takes and at one point even took a snap of the photographer.
