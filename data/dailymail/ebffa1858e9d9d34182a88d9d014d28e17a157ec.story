Full back Mathieu Debuchy believes Arsenal will be 'incredible' once World Cup winners Per Mertesacker, Mesut Ozil and Lukas Podolski have fully integrated back into the squad.

The Germany trio are expected to be involved for the first time this season for Saturday's evening kick-off at Everton, having returning to London following an extended break.

Arsenal have made a positive start to the new season, recording victories over Manchester City in the Community Shield at Wembley and Crystal Palace in the Barclays Premier League. They also left Istanbul with a goalless draw from the first leg of their Champions League play-off against Besiktas on Tuesday night.

Debuchy, signed from Newcastle earlier in the summer, is confident once Arsenal have all their key men up and running again, they will prove a force to be reckoned with.

'It is fantastic for me to be part of this team. When I see the squad now and I think that Ozil, Mertesacker and Podolski are still missing, it is incredible. It is an amazing squad,' Debuchy told the September edition of the official Arsenal magazine.

'Playing with them is pure happiness, even at training it is top level.

'You have to give your best all the time because the level required is immense.'

Debuchy has settled in quickly at right back, the £10million France defender filling the void left by the departure of compatriot Bacary Sagna to Manchester City on a free transfer.

The 29-year-old is in no doubt everything is in place at Arsenal to help develop his game.

'This is another dimension. If you compare the training grounds for example, nothing at Lille or Newcastle can match the one at Arsenal. It is another world,' he said.

'Everything here is made to optimise your preparation and you as a player so you can be in the best condition to play and win football games.'

Standards: Debuchy said the quality at Arsenal is higher than anything he has experienced before

Arsenal were beaten 3-0 at Everton in April last season, a result which looked to have dented their hopes of finishing in the top four.

Wenger feels his squad have what it takes to produce the required performance away to the Premier League's stronger sides.

'A team is life and life is movement. That means the team doesn't stand still, we move forward and improve,' said Wenger, who must do without captain and former Everton midfielder Mikel Arteta, who will miss the game against his old club because of an ankle problem.

Winners: Debuchy said that when Lukas Podolski and his fellow Germans come back Arsenal will be incredible

'We have young players, which means that every year they can be better, also the team improves with success, which we had a reasonable (amount of) last year.

'We have a good opportunity on Saturday to show that we have moved forward and that we are stronger than last year.

'It will be interesting, because Everton are a team now flirting with the Champions League places.

'They were close last year. They lost some pivotal games which allowed us to get (back) in front of them after they beat us, but they have the quality, so it is a good, good test.'
