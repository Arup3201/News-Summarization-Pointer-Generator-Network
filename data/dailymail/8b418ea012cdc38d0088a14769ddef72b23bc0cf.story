A furious family are desperate to move out of their dream home - after the trees at the end of their garden got torn down to make way for a brand-new prison block for dangerous criminals.

Ben Karrie, his wife Cheryl and their four-year-old daughter Isla were thrilled to move in to their £190,000 semi-detached home in Bridgend, South Wales.

Although they knew the notorious Parc Prison was near to their estate, they were protected from it by a large fence and dense trees, and hoped the property would be their 'forever home'.

Looming: Parc Prison, soon to be home to 1,500 dangerous prisoners, can now be seen clearly from the back of the Karries' house

Before: The prison used to be concealed from view by a dense row of trees

But not long after Mr Karrie, 35 and Mrs Karrie, 37, had bought the property in 2011, the prison was granted planning permission for a massive expansion to allow it to hold an extra 300 inmates.

The building work saw the shield of trees torn up, leaving their home in full view of what will be the prison's gatehouse and visitors' centre.

Once complete the category B prison - which has housed paedophile singer Ian Watkins - will be able to accommodate 1,500 category B prisoners once the extension is complete.

The family is so concerned by the development that they have moved their daughter's bedroom to the front of the house.

'Forever house: Ben Karrie, 37, saved for 12 years to afford the property in Bridgend, South Wales

Before: The prison used to be invisible, but now there will be a direct line of sight to the house

Mr Karrie, a retail manager, said: 'This was meant to be our perfect house - but now we feel like the prisoners because we’ve lost our privacy.

'The trees have been ripped out and every window at the back of my house overlooks a building site.

'It will be the gatehouse and visitor centre for a prison that houses some extremely dangerous men.

'It was the privacy of the house that appealed to us. We knew the prison was some way in the distance - you could only see the lights sometimes at night through the trees.

'It has devalued our property by tens of thousands of pounds'.

Despite paying a solicitor to check the area for them before buying, Mr and Mrs Karrie were not told about the prison plans. An application had first been submitted in 2010, but did not get formally approved until January 2013, so was not picked up.

Mr Karrie said: 'I saved up for 12 years to buy this house and I wanted it to be our forever home.

'We made the neccessary checks on the land behind our house and were assured everything came back clear. Now I am left with a house that has dramatically reduced in value.

'My neighbour just sold for £169,000. A huge reduction from the same houses at the other end of the street which are selling for £200,000. It’s put my family under huge strain, financially and emotionally'.

In light of the surprise development, Persmimmon Homes Wales, who sold the property to the Karrie family, has offered them the chance to move into a different home on their estate.

Glyn Mabey, Chairman of Persimmon Homes Wales, confirmed the family had been given the chance to move into another new home on their estate.

He said: 'We are aware of the concerns of Mr Karrie at our site and have offered the couple the chance to buy an alternate home. The prison facility has been there a long time before the homes were.

'We understand the couple are unhappy with the view now that the expansion work is ongoing. But we cannot guarantee anyone a view that is affected by building work on land we do not own'.
