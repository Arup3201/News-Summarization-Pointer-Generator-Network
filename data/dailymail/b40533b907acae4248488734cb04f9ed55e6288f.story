West Ham have made a £3million offer for Nice left back Timothee Kolodziejczak.

Sportsmail revealed interest from West Ham and Southampton last month but Sam Allardyce has taken the initiative with an opening bid.

The 22-year-old is regarded as one of the best young defenders in France and was wanted by Manchester United while a teenager at Lens, but turned them down as he preferred to join Lyon instead.

He failed to settle though and transferred to Nice where he has started to earn rave reviews once again.

Kolodziejcak, commonly known as Kolo, is a France U20 international but also qualifies for Poland through his father.
