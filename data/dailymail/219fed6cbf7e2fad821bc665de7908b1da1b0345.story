Michael Wade Propst took the school bus on a 14-mile joyride across Bay County, Florida when he was arrested by the local sheriff's department

Police in Florida have arrested a 12-year-old boy who stole a school bus and took it for a 14 mile joy ride to a supermarket.

Michael Wade Propst found the keys inside the yellow bus and took it from outside a house in Parker, Florida.

The driver did not notice the bus had been taken and it was not reported stolen.

The youngster was able to control the bus along the main road until he got to the Walmart superstore in Bay County, Florida.

His trip came to an end when an employee at the store noticed that the driver was having difficulty parking the vehicle.

Wal-Mart employee Roy Hoover told News Herald: 'He was having a hard time parking it, like he'd never drove one before.'

Propst
 was arrested by Bay County Sheriff's department and was charged with 
grand theft of an item worth more than $100,000 and felony criminal 
mischief.

The bus 
has an eight-foot long white scrape along the side of the vehicle, but 
Propst has told deputies that he cannot remember hitting anything during
 his joy ride.

When questioned by deputies, Propst said he was 'getting gas'.

Bay District School's head of security Mike Jones said Propst looked assured driving the bus despite his young age.

He said: 'You have to take a weeklong course to operate a bus like that. Yet at 12 he was able to drive one, and he didn’t just take it around the block.'

Major Tommy Ford of Bay County Sheriff's Office said he was investigating the cause of the damage on the side of the bus.

He said: 'We don’t know if that occurred before he got the bus, but there’s a potential he ran into something white.'
