Police are investigating the death of a two-year old boy who was found floating unconscious in a backyard pool of his Stanhope Gardens home at 10.15am on Saturday.

Emergency services were called to a home after the toddler was found floating in a backyard pool of his family home in Sydney's north-west

Emergency services were called to a house on Sentry Drive after the boy was pulled unconscious from the pool.

NSW paramedics and CareFlight's specialist doctor attempted to revive the boy before he was taken to the Children's Hospital at Westmead but he died a short time later.

Police from Quakers Hill Local Area Command are investigating the circumstances surrounding the incident and a crime scene has been established at the home. 

CareFlight spokesman Mark Lever said: 'As we go into summer it's an early reminder about the need for constant vigilance whenever young children and toddlers are near swimming pools, however secure they might seem.'

Investigations into the matter are continuing and police will prepare a report for the information of the Coroner.
