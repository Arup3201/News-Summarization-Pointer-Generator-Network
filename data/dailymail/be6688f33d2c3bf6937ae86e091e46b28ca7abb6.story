As if our children don't spend enough time staring at screens, these so-called Smart Pyjamas narrate a bedtime story when scanned by a smartphone or tablet device.

The £16 pyjamas - which start in sizes small enough for a one-year-old -  are printed with 47 clusters of dots which act like barcodes.

Are Smart Pyjamas the future of the bedtime story?

When a child scans them, one of 47 different stories plays on screen, from Mother Goose to The Little Mermaid.

The stories are written in text and narrated out loud, but children can read along on their own.

Not surprisingly, this American innovation has upset parenting groups, with one online commenter saying: 'What’s next, an app that potty trains?

'Read to your children and create memories that will last a lifetime.'

Are the days of snuggling up with a book at bedtime over?
