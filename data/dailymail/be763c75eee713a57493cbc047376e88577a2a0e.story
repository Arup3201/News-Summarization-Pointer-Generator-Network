Amal Clooney could find herself with one less high profile case to fight after Greece's new culture minister revealed they were reconsidering how to win back the Elgin Marbles.

Aristides Baltas revealed they were looking at the 'strategy' behind his country's attempts to get the 5th century BC statues returned - and were willing to 'tweak' it if necessary.

What this means for Mrs Clooney and the legal team from London chambers Doughty Street, who have been advising the Greek government on possible action in the international court to force the British Museum to hand over the marbles, is not yet known.

The Greek government began working with Doughty Street Chambers on the return of the Elgin Marbles, which have been at the British Museum for almost 200 years, last year

But new culture minister Aristides Baltas, of the left wing Syriza party, which came into power last Sunday, has said while the campaign will continue, the strategy may be tweaked. Pictured: Greeks celebrating after the election result

Mr Baltas was quoted in The Times as saying: 'Our campaign will continue, but the strategy and how we go about that may be tweaked, if required.

'We'll be looking over these details in the coming weeks and if we see a need to alter them, we will.' 

His comment comes as Greece's new left-wing government - which has pledged to ditch austerity and negotiate a better deal for the country - looks at other ways to save money. 

Syriza were elected to lead the country last Sunday.

It is thought the chambers are charging hefty fees, something which has raised eyebrows in the cash-strapped country. 

However, Mrs Clooney's attachment to the case brings with it a high profile.

Speaking in October, Mrs Clooney said it was time the British Government recognised Greece's just cause and return them

She and her husband, the actor and director George, have both spoken passionately on the subject. 

Mrs Clooney said in October: ‘The Greek government has just cause and it’s time for the British Museum to recognise that and return them to Greece. The injustice has persisted for too long.

‘The Greek government has the right to ask for the return of the marbles, 200 years after they were taken to the United Kingdom.’

MailOnline has contacted Doughty Street for a comment.
