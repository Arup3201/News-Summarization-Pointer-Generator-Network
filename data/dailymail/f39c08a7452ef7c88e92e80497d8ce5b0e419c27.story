Assaulted: Gerrard captains Liverpool in last weekend's Merseyside derby

Steven Gerrard has been assaulted in the street by a thug who abused and threatened the England and Liverpool captain.

The 33-year-old was reportedly left 'badly shaken' after the attack outside a convenience store near his luxury home.

He was alone and had just got of his Range Rover when he was confronted by the mystery attacker before the man ran away.

Gerrard was not seriously hurt, but the incident in the wealthy village near Liverpool, where he lives with his wife Alex and three young daughters, has raised fears about the family's security.

Merseyside police have confirmed they are investigating a case of common assault over the incident which happened in August.

Soon after the attack, a female police officer was arrested in an investigation into whether an attempt was made to obtain CCTV footage of the attack taken from a nearby shop.

She was questioned by detectives on suspicion of committing misconduct in a public office.

Officers took a statement from the player who is expected to captain Liverpool at Hull City on Sunday.

A Merseyside Police spokesman told the 
Sunday Mirror: 'As a result of this investigation, a female officer who 
has been on a career break since early this year is being investigated 
in relation to potential misconduct in a public office. It would be 
inappropriate to comment further at this stage.'

The attack is not the first time thugs have targeted Gerrard, who was raised in the city's Huyton area.

In September a fan scaled a perimeter wall at Liverpool’s training ground and yelled threats against his family.

The man sped away on a bike shouting: 'I’ll kill you and your f****** kids.'

In December 2007, masked raiders burst in and confronted 31-year-old Alex as the couple’s children slept.

In 2001, both Steven and Alex faced death threats from members of Liverpool’s underworld.

After Gerrard was said to have been chased by a local criminal through the streets of Liverpool in his car, steel gates 10ft high and state-of-the-art security cameras were put up at the footballer's £3million home.

Liverpool Football Club and the player’s agent refused to comment on the assault.
