QPR midfielder Joey Barton has revealed a death threat sent to him by a French fan during his time at Marseille.

The outspoken Englishman spent a season on loan at the Ligue 1 outfit in 2012/13, but according to a letter posted on Twitter, was not adored by the entirety of Marseille fans.

It appears the author of the 'fan-mail' doesn't count English as his first language, as the abusive piece is littered with grammatical inconsistencies, at one stage telling Barton he would 'die a knife'.

Joey Barton posted a letter he received from a Marseille supporter to social media site Twitter on Wednesday

The man ordered the one-time England midfielder to leave Marseille before June 1 2013 - which, coincidentally, he did - or to face the consequences.

The letter, addressed to Marseille's training ground, La Commanderie, said: 

'If you're not... I will come to you specially Marseille smash your head shots baseball bat. And then I will finish and you'll die a knife open mouth once emptied your blood b******. 

'Do you understand?'

Barton posted the letter on Twitter, with the message, 'Not sure what's more offensive, the grammar or the intent?'

Shortly after, channeling the Wealdstone Raider, the QPR man offered a reply:

''D'ue Wansum? Cos' if u du I'll give it yeh!,' before risking punishment by posting a picture of the sender's address to his 2.8 million followers.

The move could land him in hot water, as posting personal details without permission is a violation of Twitter's privacy rules.
