Prince Harry has finally arrived in Antarctica ahead of the charity trek involving wounded servicemen and women after the trip was delayed for 48 hours.

The group was forced to stay over in Cape Town this week as a storm in the south pole meant flights had to be cancelled.

This morning, Harry, a cluster of celebrities and 12 injured servicemen were given the all-clear and boarded a plane headed for Russia's 
Novolazarevskaya Station, which is situated at the edge of the Antarctic
continent.

They were met by temperatures of around minus 3C - cooler than they enjoyed in South Africa - but will face icy lows of up to minus 45C and biting 50mph winds on the trek itself.

Finally here: Prince Harry arrives in Antarctica ahead of a charity trek after his team was delayed by 48 hours due to a storm

Bracing: The Prince was certainly dressed for the weather as he stepped off the plane onto a snowy runway at Novo

Teamwork: The team, made up largely of injured servicemen and women gather next to the plane shortly after landing earlier today

Friendly: Prince Harry talks to other members of the Walking With The Wounded team after arrival

Drop in temperature: The party are expected to stay for the next couple of days to acclimatise to the Antarctic weather and make final preparations for the trek, which is due to begin next week

The three teams competing in the 
200-mile Walking With the Wounded charity trek were seen off by friends 
and family ahead of flying from Heathrow Airport last weekend.

The
royal, other supporters and the dozen injured personnel arrived at the 
Novo airbase in Antarctica this afternoon.

The party are expected to 
stay for the next couple of days to acclimatise to the Antarctic weather
and make final preparations for the trek, which is due to begin next 
week.

The teams spent the 
majority of the afternoon making adjustments to their kit, which had 
been dispatched to the base weeks earlier.

Glad to be here: Harry talks through the challenge with the Press after touching down in Antarctica

Close bond: (Right to left) Prince Harry, Kate Philp, Guy Disney, Richard Eyre, Ibrar Ali and Duncan Slater of Team UK in the challenge

Nervous? Despite having raced before with Walking With The Wounded, this will be tough for the prince

Excited: The team pose for a picture as they finally get to board the plane to start their 200-mile trek

Trained: The team are kitted out with expert equipment, having trained for months for this journey

All smiles: They have been enjoying the 30C degrees heat, but they are heading for decidedly colder climes

They are due to rest tonight ahead of skiing training tomorrow.

Once they are used to the altitude and freezing temperatures, the
teams will start the race next Friday.

The
29-year-old army attack helicopter pilot will trek alongside the 
British team in the charity race to the planet's southernmost point, 
which is expected to take 16 days. 

Ready for take off: The Prince strapped into his seat ready to fly to the edge of Antarctica

All set: The group will fly to Russia's Novolazarevskaya Station, on the edge of the Antarctic continent

Lift off: The small plane takes off signalling the start of the journey, due to finish around December 16

Team work: The British team will meet their US and Commonwealth counterparts when they land later

Ready to go: Prince Harry and actor Dominic West will spend a week acclimatising to the harsh conditions

Finally: Prince Harry and his teammates arrive at the airport to set off on their Walking With The Wounded trek

Checking in: Swedish actor Alexander Skarsgard checks into the Antarctic flight to get to the race

Excitement: The group bustle to the check-in counter. They will meet the US and Commonwealth teams later

The teams, who are taking part in the Walking
With The Wounded challenge, were told on Monday that their flight would
be delayed by at least 24 hours because of the adverse weather in 
Antarctica.

Each team has a mentor and a polar guide.

Harry
is patron of organisers Walking With The Wounded, which raises funds to
retrain injured troops and help them find new careers outside the 
military.  

Stunning: Actor Dominic West, who is captain of the Commonwealth Walking With The Wounded team, is seen looking over Cape Town as they wait to leave South Africa for the Antarctic

On hold: The teams of celebrities and injured service personnel arrived in South Africa have been told to wait in Cape Town until a storm dies down in Antarctica

Glorious: The challengers instead enjoyed some wonderful summer scenes in 30C temperatures

Life's a beach: The teams, who are taking part in the Walking With The Wounded challenge, were told on Monday that their flight would be delayed by at least 24 hours because of the adverse weather in Antarctica

On a high: The teams will eventually fly out from Cape Town to an air base near Russia's Novolazarevskaya Station, which is situated at the edge of the Antarctic continent

Waiting game: The Prince arrived in South Africa last weekend for what was meant to be a brief stopover with the teams of celebrities and wounded troops he has joined for his South Pole trek

Upbeat: Prince Harry looked relaxed as he landed in Cape Town, South Africa, last week

Pit stop: Prince Harry travelled with 12 wounded servicemen to Cape Town ahead of a 200-mile race

Calm before the storm: Prince Harry join other members of the British team in the team bus which headed to a nearby hotel along the coast for some relaxation time before leaving for the South Pole

Keeping calm: The Prince didn't seem at all daunted by the challenge ahead

He launched the charity's South Pole Allied Challenge in London's Trafalgar Square on Thursday.

'All the men and women behind me have achieved so much just to get here, let alone actually walk to the South Pole,' he said, flanked by the competitors. 'It's just a wonderful display of courage from their part.

'These guys aim to achieve something quite remarkable, and in doing so will prove to everybody else that even though you've lost a leg or lost an arm, or whatever your illness may be, that you can achieve pretty much anything if you put your mind to it.'

He added: 'This trip is another way of reminding everybody that as Afghanistan draws down and these guys aren't in the news any more... the support must continue.'

Trekking around 15 miles per day, the teams will be pulling 155lb sleds.They
will likely endure temperatures as low as -35C and wind speeds of around 50 miles per hour.

Patron: The Virgin Money South Pole Allied Challenge 2013, of which Harry is patron, will see them race across the Antarctic to the South Pole

Preparation: The teams will all fly on to a Russian base in Antarctica tomorrow where they will be given a few days to acclimatise to the freezing weather conditions

Speaking at London Heathrow Airport on Sunday before departing, British army veteran Ibrar Ali, whose right arm was amputated after a roadside bombing in Afghanistan in 2007, felt both nervous and excited about the challenge ahead.

'A bit like pre-tour when you're just about sat at Brize Norton (airbase) when you're just about to go out to Iraq or Afghanistan,' he said.

Speaking of Harry's involvement, he added: 'He's a great team member and just fits in really well so no different to anyone else.'

Harry, who is fourth in line to the throne, joined the Walking With The Wounded trek to the North Pole in 2011.

However, he had to come home early to be best man at his brother Prince William's wedding.
