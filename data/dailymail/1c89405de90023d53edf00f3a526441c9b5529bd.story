It's not often that Britain needs any help to get rain for a big sporting occasion but this week’s sunny weather means that Olympic opening ceremony director Danny Boyle may need to deploy his fake clouds.

Forecasters said there is only a 10 per cent chance of showers tonight.

Thunderstorms are likely to reach London by the afternoon but it is thought they will have cleared well before the  ‘pre-show’ starts at 8.12pm.

Searchlights shine over the Olympic Stadium during a rehearsal for the opening ceremony: Fake rain may be needed after all, is forecasts prove correct

It means that Boyle may need to fulfil
his promise to produce ‘fake rain’ from clouds hung over the Olympic 
stadium. He has previously said that he wanted a typical British 
downpour to feature during the ceremony and had created artificial 
clouds as a back-up.

Mr Boyle said last month: ‘The clouds will provide rain on the evening, just  in case.’

Last night, a forecaster with 
Meteogroup said there was only a ‘5 to 10 per cent chance of rain’ in 
the evening, while a Met Office forecaster said there was a ‘slim 
chance’ of a downpour.

It should be another warm day, with temperatures reaching up to 27C (81F) in the south and 22C (72F) in the north.

It will remain warm in the evening, 
hovering around 21C (70F). The weekend will be cooler, with 
temperatures  as low as 19C (66F) on Saturday.

However, it should remain dry for the 
men’s road race in Surrey, where British rider Mark Cavendish is 
expected to win a gold medal.

It will become wetter on Sunday, when the women’s race takes place, with widespread showers nationwide.

Meteogroup forecaster Gareth Harvey 
said: ‘There is a risk of a few thundery showers during the day, so 
people making their way to the Olympic Stadium could get a bit wet.

‘But these should have cleared in time for the opening ceremony. It will feel quite humid in the evening.’

Into the next week, the first full 
week of the Olympics, the weather will be cooler, reaching highs of 21C 
(70F) in the south and 18C (64F) in the north.

Minimum temperatures are expected to 
drop to single figures during Monday night, with lows of 8C in northern 
areas, but should rise later in the week.

Monday will be considerably milder, with highs of 18C (64F) in the south and 17C (63F) in the north.

Reverse rain dance: A Native American Apache tribe performed a sacred dance to hold off the rain throughout the London 2012 Games

From Monday and throughout the rest of
the week, the weather is expected to be a mixture of sunshine, clouds 
and scattered showers.

They are more commonly known to 
dance in the hope of bringing rain, but a group of Apache dancers 
performed in London today hoping to do the opposite.

British Airways flew the
group of five Native Americans of the Yellow Bird Indian Dancers from 
Arizona over especially for the dance. They did their thing near Tower Bridge in a bid to influence the 
weather during the Olympics and keep the sun shining over the capital.

They performed a traditional dance to ask 'the Creator' to keep the weather mild for the Games.

Chief
Ken Duncan, who leads the group, said: 'Over the past week I have begun
daily prayers and requests to the Creator, asking him to speak with the
rain on our behalf.

'I have
visited with and asked my spiritual elders from various tribes to pray 
with me. Many will be with me in spirit as I approach the rain, and the 
prayers will continue until I return to Arizona.

'I am asking the rain to watch from afar and see the many people from the many lands come together and play as one.'

The unsettled conditions are set to 
continue next week, with temperatures managing only 17C (63F) at the 
weekend and a risk of thunder on Saturday.

Barry Gromett, of the Met Office, 
said: ‘At the moment, we have high pressure coming up from continental 
Europe, hence the clear skies and hot weather in the South. Next week, 
we will return to a mixture of sunshine, showers and cooler 
temperatures.’

The long range forecast also paints a depressing picture.

A spokesman from the Met Office said 
they were 'not writing summer off' just yet but did explain that a 
lengthy spell of hot, sunny weather across the whole country looks 
unlikely for August.

The spokesman said August weather would 'remain changeable'.

'The south and east is perhaps most likely to see the 
best of any dry, bright, and at times warm weather,' they said.

The first week of August currently looks like it will be a washout. The spokesman said: 'Overall, temperatures will be below 
normal and it will feel much cooler than recent days.

'There is 
the possibility of some longer-lasting dry spells across southern parts 
of the UK later in the period, with temperatures perhaps returning to 
near normal in any dry and sunny weather. However, the cool and showery 
conditions will tend to persist elsewhere.'

Today temperatures have already reached 28.2C in Hampshire but forecasters say they are unlikely to beat yesterday's 31C.

Yesterday’s temperature beat the 
previous day by a fraction of a degree and was even higher than that in 
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where temperatures reached just 27C (81F).

What a mess: Thousands sizzled on Brighton beach
on Wednesday, on what was the hottest day of the year so far. This was the 
scene that faced litter pickers yesterday morning

In Bournemouth, 100,000 people hit 
the beaches. Staff at a sea-front ice cream kiosk reckoned takings were 
up four-fold compared with recent weeks. At nearby Poole, all the beach 
furniture had been hired out by 11am when an estimated 30,000 
sun-seekers arrived.

On the Isle of Wright, meanwhile, a road was closed when it started to blister and melt in the heat.

Not everyone is enjoying glorious 
weather, however, with Scotland and Northern Ireland seeing temperatures
of no more than 19C (66F) so far this week.
