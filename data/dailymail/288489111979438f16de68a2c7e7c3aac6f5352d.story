Have you seen this man? Dorset Police have released this image of a man with his face covered and gripping a knife during a robbery - but won't call him a suspect to protect his human rights

With his face covered by a makeshift balaclava and a knife gripped in his right hand during a robbery at a bookmakers, it is probably safe to say this man is up to no good.

CCTV footage also shows him threatening a cashier at Ladbrokes in the east Dorset village of West Moors before making off with cash from the till.

But today the county's over-cautious force refused to call him a suspect in the violent crime, in case it breaches his human rights.

And detectives have appealed for the public to help identify him - even though his face is impossible to see - and even hope he might come forward himself.

A force spokesman maintained today the man in the photos is not necessarily the robber, just 'someone we want to talk to' in connection with the attack.

This is because Dorset Police believe 
calling him a wanted man could impact on his 'right to a fair trial', 
and they say they would treat any person potentially involved in a crime
 in the same way.

Gawain Towler, a spokesman for UKIP, said: 'Actions like this are pointless and make the police laughable.

'It's all part of the retreat from common sense language. Calling a suspect a suspect does not imply guilt.

'In this instance they are being daft and it creates a lack of respect for the police if they can't be straight with us - it's counter productive.'

They have also failed to issue a description of the robber, leaving out key details such as his height, build and accent.

Members of the public who are being asked to help name the offender took to internet message boards to poke fun at the appeal.

One wrote: 'This has to be a wind up. Not sure what's more laughable, the detective asking the man to contact him - errr do you really think that's likely? - or the CCTV image showing a man with his face completely obscured from view?'Â 

Dorset resident Carol Smith posted: 'How stupid is that? Shall we look for a man with a black woolly thing over his head?'

Don't call him a suspect! The police have released these images in the hope he will be identified - despite his face being completely covered

The robbery happened at 6.50pm on February 26.

Detective Constable James Lee, the investigating officer, said: 'I am now able to release CCTV images of the man I wish to speak with.

'I urge the man pictured - and anyone who recognises him - to contact me, in confidence, as soon as possible.

'I also would like to hear from anyone who saw this man enter or leave the premises around the time of the incident.'

When asked about the fact that the suspect's face is hidden, a force spokesman said: 'We are looking for people to identify the man, not just his face.

'We are not suggesting the man in the pictures is the suspect, just someone we want to talk to.'

The spokesman confirmed that no arrests have been made in connection to the raid.
