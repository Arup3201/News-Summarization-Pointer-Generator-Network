Tesla Motors has unveiled plans for a $5billion Gigafactory to ramp up production of batteries for its electric cars.

The Californian firm is still deciding where the factory will be based, but the project is set provide more than 6,500 jobs.

Tesla claims the factory will cut current battery production costs by up to 30 per cent, and it will be powered predominantly by renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar.

Tesla Motors has unveiled plans for a $5billion Gigafactory, illustration pictured, to ramp up production of batteries for its electric cars. The Californian firm is still deciding where the factory will be based, but it is expected to be powered predominantly by renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar

A staggering 96,000 plug-in electric cars were bought in the U.S. in 2013
alone and while these eco-conscious consumers make up a small fraction of overall car
owners, sales are up 84 per cent on 2012.

While sales of electric vehicles are expected to reach 7.5 million across the world by the end of the decade.

By comparison, Tesla sells fewer than 2,000 of its Model S cars each month.

Shares in the firm rose by 16 per cent earlier this week, and reports claim it has risen by 700 per cent in the past year.

The shortlisted locations include Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and Nevada. 

The company said in a blog post: â€˜The Gigafactory is designed to reduce cell costs much faster than the status quo and, by 2020, produce more lithium ion batteries annually than were produced worldwide in 2013.â€™

Tesla is putting $2billion into the project and the remaining costs will be paid for by partners.

The companyâ€™s projected figures claim 
the plant will produce more than half a million batteries when it opens in 2020, to match the projected number of vehicles it hopes to produce. 

Market research firm Bharat Book Bureau believes sales of electric cars will rise by 19 per cent between now and 2020.

They did take a dip of more than 6 per cent last October when a fire that ravaged a Tesla Model S electric car was said to have begun in the vehicle's battery compartment.

In an incident report, released under Washington state's public records law, officials wrote they thought the fire had started in the car's battery compartment after the car hit a piece of metal debris.
