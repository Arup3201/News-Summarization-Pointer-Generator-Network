'It was a technology transfer project, we built a robot for the NY fire department, so we decided to put a fun twist on it,' Susan Payne of SuperDroid Robots, the North Carolina firm that developed it, told MailOnline.

The robot weight about 400lbs, and can run for two hours on two car batteries - with the option to add more.

The blade can be lifted and lowered pneumatically.

Options include chains for the wheels, cameras and WiFi access.

'It'll plow a parking lot on a single charge, and works best in 2-6 inches of snow,' said Payne.

The robo-plough was originally built for internal use, but has had so much attention the first has now started selling the gadget.

It can be controlled via a standard remote control unit, or upgraded with wifi and cameras.

'You could remote control is from your computer,' said Payne.

The firm can also customise the plough for each user, and has already upgraded it with headlights to make it easier to control.
