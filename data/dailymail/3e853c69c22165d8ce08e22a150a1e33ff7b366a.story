Clearly her new role as a UN ambassador left her with little time to make her first store as immaculate as she might have liked.

And it meant frantic preparations were still taking place at Victoria Beckham’s shop in the final minutes before it opened its doors.

Windows were boarded up, while the paintwork was still being finished. Boxes were still arriving, and there were reports of bags of clothes seen lying on the ground, not yet hung up on rails.

Frantic preparations were still taking place at Victoria Beckham’s shop in London in the final minutes before it opened its doors

Work was being carried out despite people having queued for hours outside the new Mayfair store

The shop is Mrs Beckham's first stand-alone venue, though she does sell of her line online 

Tins of paint lay discarded on stone steps outside the shop on the morning of the opening, as well as high-visibility jackets dumped by workers on their tea break.

And it shocked the customers who had been queuing for hours outside. Many began speculating the opening might never happen, with some giving up and going home.

The shop has employed a modern look and does not have tills or even a window display 

One, Declan Clancey said: ‘It’s just shoddy really. I’ve seen inside when someone came out and there’s all builders and bare floorboards, it’s a mess. There’s no ways it’s opening today, no way. It’s a mess.

‘They couldn’t even be bothered to sweep the fag ends off the steps. And the steps are crumbling, it’s a disgrace, I would be ashamed if I was her. I don’t even like the woman, I was just hoping David might be coming down. I don’t care about her shop but she’s making a mockery out of her fans. I thought there would be more people here than this but they haven’t missed much.’

Jessica Kalirai, 24, said: ‘It seems quite last minute thought it would have been ready, they’ve been doing it long enough. But I’ve been here since 9 and it’s been a bit frantic, lots of touching up and stuff.’

Mrs Beckham has advertised the launch of her store on Twitter over recent weeks and has described it as a family affair

David was on hand to man the store in his wife's absence, while Mrs Beckham’s mother, Jackie Adams, her father Anthony and sister Louise also dropped by 

Mrs Beckham was at the UN in New York with world leaders on the shop's opening day, where she was named goodwill ambassador 

Another woman, who did not wish to be named, added: ‘It’s not a terribly welcoming sight.’

The shop is Mrs Beckham’s first stand-alone venue, although her collections are also stocked in Selfridge’s and online retailer Net-a-Porter.

In a recent interview the designer insisted the shop will be a family affair, with Mr Beckham on the door, Mrs Beckham behind the till and their eldest son Brooklyn, 15, working as a Saturday boy.

The couple have three other children: Romeo, 11, Cruise, 9, and two-year-old Harper.

And after using Twitter to publicise the store in recent weeks, it was indeed a family affair - with David, Mrs Beckham’s mother, Jackie Adams, her father Anthony and sister Louise dropping in.

Outside the shop onlooker Surin Malik, 46, said: ‘The fact she [Mrs Beckham] is not here is a massive disappointment. I really, really hoped she would be. It’s such a shame. She’s let a lot of people down.’

Becks minds the shop: New goodwill ambassador Victoria wows UN in New York as her first fashion store opens its doors in London 

By Paul Harris 

They were separated by 3,500 miles and two rather different jobs.

In six-inch heels, Victoria Beckham click-clacked in the footsteps of world leaders at the United Nations in New York yesterday and made an impassioned plea to safeguard women’s health and stop babies dying of Aids.

And husband David? He stayed at home to mind the shop. The new shop in Mayfair.

While Victoria Beckham hung out with world leaders at the UN in New York, her husband David stayed at home to mind the new shop in Mayfair 

The world-renowned footballer-cum-charity do-gooder swapped roles temporarily with his fashion leader wife to allow her to make her political debut on the world stage.

Meanwhile he bowled up in scuffed brown shoes for the launch of the ex-Spice Girl’s swish new clothing store.

Ordinarily, those who queued for a first glimpse of VB’s sales floor might have expected their heroine to oversee the opening.

But even as they scrambled for a peek inside, perhaps equally excited at the prospect of meeting DB, Victoria was unavoidably elsewhere – wowing them at the UN after being made an International Goodwill Ambassador.

The role gets her instant membership of a celebrity club that includes Angelina Jolie, Emma Watson and Leonardo DiCaprio, who have all used their star status to draw attention to UN good works.

In a sober suit, and with barely a hint of her trademark pout, the 40-year-old said she was ‘humbled and honoured’ to represent the UN in its Aids campaign, adding: ‘For some reason people will listen to me. This is the beginning of an incredible journey for me.’

That journey appears to have been inspired by a trip to South Africa, where she met children stricken by Aids and spoke to afflicted mothers. The visit was part of the Born Free initiative, which tackles the issue of HIV being transmitted from mother to child.

‘I came home and I knew I had to do something,’ the mother-of-four said yesterday. ‘I think every woman has the right to health, and every woman has the right to give their children a healthy future.’

Elton, she said (that’s Sir Elton John) was a ‘dear friend’ of her and her husband, and the couple had been patrons of the piano player’s Aids Foundation for 20 years.

‘Babies should not be born with HIV and we can stop that,’ she said. ‘I’m a mother, a woman, and I want to reach out and help as many women and mothers as I can.’

Back in London, David - who was wearing scuffed brown shoes - was reaching out to help his wife’s other interests

Back in London, David was reaching out to help his wife’s other interests. Her store is a bold venture into traditional retail as opposed to online shopping. Traditional, that is, until you step inside the shop.

It would have been fun to see David Beckham behind a till, for example – but there aren’t any. Sales are made through iPads, doing away with anything so vulgar as a cash register.

There is no window display, and the goods are arranged with the minimalist chic of an art installation (or, depending on your point of view, in a way that makes it look as if the shop has already been burgled).

Victoria will be there from time to time – but she has other agendas. At the UN she said she would be back in South Africa in a few weeks ‘and then further afield next year’.
