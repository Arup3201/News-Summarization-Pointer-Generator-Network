An actor playing Jesus Christ Superstar became a family's real-life saviour after he rescued them from a house fire.

Levi James helped terrified Rebecca Hemmings, her partner Tom Dudley, both 19, and their 10-month-old daughter Phoebe to safety after a 15-foot-high blaze engulfed sheds outside their Bristol home.

Flames were seen leaping up the front wall of the home as the drama unfolded on Tuesday night in the Patchway area of the city.

In the picture Mr James, circled, can seen dwarfed by the flames as he tried to use a normal garden hose to douse the inferno.

Arsonists had set alight to sheds outside Durban House flats, off Pretoria Road in Patchway, at around 11.30pm.

The blaze, described as a 'towering inferno', threatened not only the house but also a car parked outside.

Mr James spotted the flames from his bedroom window and leaped into action. Neighbours told him the family were inside and he saw the family's Ford Fiesta was in danger of being set alight too.

Windows on the house had cracked and the paint on the side of the vehicle was starting to peel.

He said: 'I ran past the fire and 
hammered on the door. They came down with a baby but she was a bit 
nervous and didn't know whether she could come out.

'The fire was hot, it was a towering inferno. I saw the car's petrol tank sizzling.

'I stood between her and the fire and shielded her from it.'

Miss Hemmings' brother Jack, 22, was also in the house at the time and escaped.

She said the fire was all 
the more terrifying because her daughter was sleeping upstairs in
a cot next to the window where the fire broke out.

She said: 'There was a big bang and 
all you could see was flames coming up. I didn't know whether the fire 
had spread to the house.

'I got my brother, shut the doors and went into the living room.'

Mr James tried to use a hose from his house to put out the fire but it wouldn't reach, so he unscrewed it and took it a house next door to the fire.

He said: 'I started to try and get the fire under control. The fire service turned up a couple of minutes after that and I thought I'd probably let the big boys deal with it.

'I assumed it was a petrol bomb or some kind of arson.'

The 38-year-old actor has been earning praise appearing in an amateur production of the musical Jesus Christ Superstar.

He's now been dubbed 'our little saviour' by the family.

The fire completely destroyed the sheds, which included a bike and a number of Phoebe's toys, but no-one was injured.

Miss Hemmings said: 'None of us had shoes or socks on and my partner was just in his shorts.

'We got back into the house at around 1.30am but I didn't really get any sleep.

'They don't realise that every flat here has kids in. Her cot is by my window. If my car had gone up it would have smashed the windows.'

Mr James, who last week played the title role in an adaptation of  Andrew Lloyd Webber's Jesus Christ Superstar for the Thornbury Musical Theatre group, was humble about his part in the blaze drama.

He said: 'I don't think of it as a big hero thing. You've just got to get your head down and solve the problem.'

Avon and Somerset Police confirmed that the fire was an arson attack and appealed for witnesses to come forward.

A spokesman said: 'A communal shed was set on fire, causing the shed to be completely burnt out, and causing heat damage to a vehicle parked nearby and a block of flats.'
