When it comes to the FA Cup, Manchester United have edged Barclays Premier League rivals Arsenal in recent years, winning three of their last five meetings.

This year, the pair have been pitted against each other once again, in the quarter-finals - the difference this time being that Sir Alex Ferguson will not be in charge of United.

Can Arsenal, the current holders, balance the scales and reach the last four?

Goals either side of half-time saw Arsenal bag a comfortable win over their top-flight rivals. Edu opened the scoring for the Gunners in the 34th minute with a free-kick which deflected off the shoulder of David Beckham and wrong-footed Fabien Barthez. The visitors struck another blow to United's comeback hopes when Sylvain Wiltord took the ball around Wes Brown before converting a well-placed shot for Arsenal's second in the 52nd minute, putting the game out of reach.

Arsenal 0 Manchester United 1 - FA Cup semi-final, April 2004

United secured their place in the final by beating Arsenal at Villa Park, where Paul Scholes fired home the only goal. It came just after half an hour when Ryan Giggs squared a ball in from the right to an unmarked Scholes, whose fierce shot sailed past Jens Lehmann. Arsenal did have their chances, however, with Edu and Patrick Vieira both hitting the woodwork and frequently forcing Roy Carroll into action. The defeat ended the Gunners' 18-match unbeaten FA Cup run, which stretched back to their 2001 defeat to Liverpool in the final.

Arsenal 0 Manchester United 0 (Arsenal win 5-4 on penalties) - FA Cup final, May 2005

Arsenal held on for a goalless draw after a dominant Manchester United performance in the Wembley final, which the Gunners went on to win 5-4 on penalties. United were unable to beat in-form goalkeeper Lehmann, who made crucial saves throughout before saving Scholes' penalty to clinch the cup. United came close with chances from Wayne Rooney, who hit the post, and Ruud van Nistlerooy, whose effort was deflected onto the bar by Freddie Ljungberg. Come the shoot-out, Arsenal, who had Jose Antonio Reyes sent off in the final minute of extra-time, maintained their composure and scored all five penalties, the fifth converted by Vieira.

Manchester United 4 Arsenal 0 - FA Cup fifth-round, February 2008

A dominant first-half performance saw Manchester United ease to victory over Arsenal in the fifth round. United were 3-0 up by half-time thanks to headed efforts by Rooney and Darren Fletcher which effectively put the game out of reach after 20 minutes, with Nani netting a third just before the break. The Gunners' luck worsened shortly after the restart when Emmanuel Eboue was sent off for a foul on Patrice Evra, ruling out any glimmer of a comeback. The match was finally put to bed in the 74th minute when Fletcher headed in his second and United's fourth.

Manchester United 2 Arsenal 0 - FA Cup quarter-final, March 2011

United secured a comfortable win over Arsenal in the last eight, silencing a few of Ferguson's critics. The veteran Scottish manager had come under pressure prior to the game thanks to league defeats at Liverpool and Chelsea, resulting in a drastic squad reshuffle which saw seven defenders start against the Gunners. United went in at half-time 1-0 up thanks to Fabio's goal, with Rooney putting the game out of reach at the start of the second half. Arsenal's FA Cup exit came shortly after they had lost to Birmingham in the League Cup final, and to Barcelona in the Champions League.
