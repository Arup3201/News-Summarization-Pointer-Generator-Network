A hapless mystery driver has left police baffled after they discovered an empty truck wedged in a tree 10ft off the ground.

Emergency crews were called to reports of a vehicle spotted dangling from a tree in Sherwood, Oregon, on Sunday morning, and rushed to the scene in case anybody was trapped.

But after using thermal imagers to scan the vehicle and 
surrounding areas they were able to confirm the truck was empty and no 
passengers had not been thrown out in the crash.

Poor parking skills: Emergency services were baffled to discover a car wedged in a tree 10ft off the ground in Sherwood, Oregon, U.S.

The
firefighters' thermal imagers didn't pick up any traces of heat 
'signatures' - suggesting the crash had happened some time before the 
truck was discovered.

Calls to the local Providence Newberg Hospital revealed nobody had been admitted with injuries in the wake of a car accident.

A statement from Oregon's Tualatin Valley Fire and Rescue revealed details of how the truck came to rest in the tree still remain a mystery.

A statement from Oregon's Tualatin 
Valley Fire and Rescue revealed details of how the truck came to rest in
the tree still remain a mystery.

It read: 'After using thermal imagers
which did not pick up any heat 'signatures' a PGE lineman in a boom 
truck further validated that the truck was empty.

'The first 911 call reporting the situation was at 7.33am when Tualatin Valley Fire and Rescue responded.

'And a call to Providence Newberg Hospital revealed no patients overnight or early this morning related to a crash.

'The details of how the truck came to rest in the tree remains a mystery at this time.'

Bizarre: The thermal imagers failed to detect any heat 'signatures', indicating the vehicle had been left suspended in the branches of the tree for some time
