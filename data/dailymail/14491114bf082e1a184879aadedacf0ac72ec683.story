Police have ruled out allegations that the News of the World gave the parents of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler ‘false hope’ by deleting her voicemails.

A five-month investigation found that while staff at the now-defunct tabloid did intercept some of Milly’s messages, there was ‘no evidence’ to support claims that they then cynically erased them to make room for new ones to be left.

A senior detective told the Leveson Inquiry yesterday that although there was still a question mark over two of Milly’s messages which had apparently been wiped several weeks after her disappearance, they may well have been deleted automatically.

Anger: Bob Dowler and Sally Dowler, the parents of murdered Milly Dowler, give evidence at the Leveson inquiry last November. Mrs Dowler said she didn't sleep for three nights after being told that Milly's phone had been hacked

Detective Chief Inspector John MacDonald said the truth of exactly how they were erased will probably never be known.

The incendiary allegation made in the 
Guardian that journalists had deliberately deleted Milly’s voicemails 
accelerated the closure of the News of the World, and was a significant 
factor in prompting the Leveson Inquiry into Press standards.

It was also followed by a £3million 
compensation payment. News International, which ran the News of the 
World, paid the Dowlers £2million with Rupert Murdoch personally 
donating an additional £1million, which was split between six charities 
of their choice.

Milly, 13, vanished on March 21, 2002, while walking home in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey.

In heart-breaking testimony to the 
Leveson Inquiry last November, Sally Dowler recounted the night of March
24, 2002, when she rang her daughter’s mobile phone and found fresh 
space was available on its previously full voicemail account.

She shouted to her husband: ‘She’s picked up her voicemail, Bob. She’s alive!’

Victim: The News of the World admitted hacking Milly Dowler's mobile phone but it remains unknown whether two missing messages were deleted deliberately or were removed from her message box automatically

The previously automated response had 
suddenly reverted to Milly’s own greeting. The sound of her daughter’s 
voice led Mrs Dowler to believe Milly had deleted some messages.

But the Scotland Yard inquiry found 
the deletions had been made automatically by the phone company, which at
that time automatically wiped all messages after 72 hours.

Mr MacDonald said there is no evidence
anyone attempted to hack Milly’s mobile phone before March 26, 2002, 
two days after Mrs Dowler made the call which gave her false hope.

He said police cannot conclusively say
whether any of Milly’s voicemails were manually deleted after that 
date, although two messages are missing.

He added: ‘It is not known why that happened and it will not now be possible to provide an explanation.’

False hope: The Dowlers also criticised police for not prosecuting phone hacking in 2002, the year their daughter's mobile was accessed

Yesterday, after carrying out a 
detailed analysis of call data and phone company procedures at the time,
Mr MacDonald effectively confirmed that it was ‘unlikely’ the News of 
the World was behind the deletions.

Milly’s body was discovered in 
woodland in September 2002.

Last year former nightclub doorman Levi 
Bellfield was jailed for life for her murder.
