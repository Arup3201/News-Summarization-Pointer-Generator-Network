It was the time of her life he wanted to capture forever and when Justin Sylvester's wife became pregnant for the second time, he wanted to savour the moment with a photo shoot.

However, his wife refused to pose before the camera, so the 31-year-old Austin insurance consultant decide to organize a photo shoot for himself.

It wasn't just any point-and-shoot affair. Instead, Mr Sylvester struck the familiar poses of those taken by countless pregnant woman - and presumably the kind he would have liked his wife to mimic.

Striking a pose: Justin Sylvester, an Austin insurance consultant, and his wife are expecting their second child. He wanted his wife to commemorate the big event with photos, but she said no

Manternity: Sylvester decided he, and his beer belly, would stand in for some maternity photos

Of course, Mr Sylvester's belly isn't from pregnancy or any health condition of any kind, but beer.

With the help of Austin photographer Kerri Lohmeier, Mr Sylvester and his 'manternity' photos are now famous after going viral on the Internet.

Lohmeier has been shooting traditional maternity photos for about four years but had never done a man-ternity shoot before.

While her typical photo shoots are serious, she and Mr Sylvester couldn’t keep a straight face for this one.

Seeing double: So many husbands have taken a pose where they are seen to be kissing their partners pregnant stomach, but hear Justin Sylvester doubles up!

Sylvester is featured in a wide range of poses, trying to emulate what a photo shoot might have looked with his pregnant wife.

Posing in just Superman underwear the man is seen eating ice cream and gazing lovingly at his round belly.

The hilarious pictures show him proudly pushing out his belly while striking popular expectant mother poses.

'I call my Facebook feed 'Babybook,' because it's filled with nothing but people having babies and maternity pics,' he told People.

Pushing it out: Justin said that pushing his stomach out for half an hour in the way that he did, actually began to hurt after a while

'I asked my wife, Meghan, if she wanted to take maternity pictures,she is nine months pregnant and due any day now.

She didn't take them for our first child, and said she didn't want to now. When I sat back down I said, 'Screw it, I'll hire my own photographer and do it myself.'

'It was too hysterical,' says photographer Kerri Lohmeier of Harley K Photography.

Getting the photos just right meant Sylvester had to stick out his belly for about a half-hour.

'It hurts your stomach to stick it out for that long,' he told Austin360.

Sweet tooth: Mr Sylvester eats straight from a tub as his pregnancy causes massive cravings!

How he really is: See, he doesn't have a beer belly at all!

'After the shoot, my stomach and lower back hurt — for 30 minutes I realized what it might be like to be pregnant.'

In one photo, Ms Lohmeier even managed to manipulate the picture to show Sylvester kissing his own belly bump - just as so many loving husbands have done to their wives.

Sylvester says his wife was in tears, laughing so hard when she received her gift. And while all the attention was a surprise, he says his friends and family weren’t necessarily shocked by the photos. 'They all know me and my sense of humor,' he says.
