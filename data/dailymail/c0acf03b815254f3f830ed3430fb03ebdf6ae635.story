Ten days ago Manuel Pellegrini’s grey hair was going even greyer. Out came the Grecian 2000, mixed in with some jet black boot polish, and all of a sudden the City boss and his team are looking lively again! He’s proved his critics, including me, wrong.

Well, sort of.

It could all be temporary, of course.

The top four of the Premier League shows Manchester City six points behind leaders Chelsea after 13 games

Honestly, ask yourself this: should Mancheser City with the players they have, the recent years of success and the resources at the disposal be winning the three games they’ve just won? Yes of course!

It’s no shock that City beat Swansea, Bayern Munich’s 10-man reserve team, and Southampton.

By now, City should be standing tall alongside the very best in Europe. Pellegrini’s great escape from Champions League Group E will be looked on as something special. But they shouldn’t have got themselves into this mess in the first place.

The best defenders aren’t those who always end up making last-ditch tackles, they’re the ones who don’t get themselves into trouble at all.

And at the very top level the same applies to managers.

But what Pellegrini has proved this week is that he can deliver under pressure.

A City-supporting friend of mine spoke with me before the Swansea fixture, and said if they lost two of the forthcoming three games then the manager should go. Pellegrini knew that two defeats would almost certainly mean City were out of the only competitions Sheikh Mansour is interested in winning – the Champions League and the Premier League.

Pellegrini deserves credit for delivering under pressure... but three wins does not mean he's done enough

Samir Nasri, Aguero and Yaya Toure celebrate after the latter put City 1-0 up against Southampton on Sunday

Things couldn’t have gone better: Roma drew in Russia, Bayern played a weakened side and had a man sent off, Sergio Aguero turned it on at just the right time, City won all three games, and even Chelsea dropped points.

It could be the week that transforms City’s season. In fact it should be.

But they still have a tough task in the Champions League, and they are still six points behind Chelsea at the top of the table.

And that’s the problem for Pellegrini. He’s had a terrific week, but he can hardly wave it in the faces of us critics because City are still some way off where they should be this season.

A tough week for Pellegrini to come through and he deserves credit, but let’s not get carried away – he’s got a lot of work to do before he proves he is the right manager to take Manchester City to where the owners want them to be – dominating domestically and in Europe.
