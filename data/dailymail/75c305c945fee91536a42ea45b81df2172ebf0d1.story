John Garner, 53, died after being found with serious head and leg injuries surrounded by debris, oil and thick smoke off the coast of St Vincent on Wednesday

The diving instructor who was first to the scene of a British sailor’s yacht after it caught fire in the Caribbean does not believe he was murdered.

John Garner, 53, was found with serious head and leg injuries surrounded by debris, oil and thick smoke off the coast of St Vincent on Wednesday. He was pronounced dead upon arrival at hospital on Wednesday afternoon.

A murder investigation is underway and police have said they are hoping to speak to the Briton’s wife, Heidi Hukkelass. But Kay Wilson, a professional diver from Bristol who has lived in the Caribbean for 12 years, does not believe he was murdered.

Ms Wilson said: ‘My initial impression was that it was an accident. There is the fact that it had happened around lunchtime and there was an explosion on board.

‘The injuries this person had was, from my perspective, that something had exploded in his face and he had injuries to his face and leg.

‘I did not see any defensive wounds or anything that would suggest that there was foul play.’

Mr Garner flew to St Vincent with his wife on January 19.

But ex-pats living on the island - including Ms Wilson - said Miss Hukkelaas left her partner two days previously, to return to Norway to look after her children, as planned.

And despite Caribbean police claiming to be searching for Miss Hukkelaas, Norwegian authorities said no requests have been made with them regarding her whereabouts, only to inform Norwegian relatives that Mr Garner had died.

'We have not been asked to do anything but inform relatives of the incident,’ a spokesperson for Norwegian Police told Verdens Gang.

‘We are not aware that the Norwegian woman is wanted internationally and there is no such request regarding this woman in our system.’

St Vincent police commissioner Michael
 Charles said: ‘We are treating the death as suspicious and are looking 
at all lines of inquiry. We suspect foul play and will investigate the 
matter fully.

‘Miss 
Hukkelaas is a person of interest and as with every murder investigation
 we have to look at everyone and everything and will leave no stones 
unturned.’

Officers said checks revealed Miss Hukkelaas had not left the country via any of the island’s main airports or seaports.

The commissioner refused to confirm her nationality or relationship to the deceased last night.

However, Norwegian newspaper Verdens Gang
 has been in touch with the Miss Hukkelaas' family and they have confirmed
 that she is back in her home country, arriving the day before the 
incident.

Ms Wilson, who owns Indigo 
Watersports, said she was taking a boat trip full of guests from a 
nearby hotel resort when she saw smoke on the horizon and went to 
investigate.

She said 
she and her crew discovered Mr Garner's body free floating in the water 
wearing a life jacket, with severe lacerations to his face and legs.

A burning life raft was also found close to the yacht, which was well ablaze, she said.

His
 passport and personal documents were floating nearby in a waterproof 
'grab bag' - a tool commonly used by yachtsman in case of emergency.

Only his personal details were found in the bag, indicating that he was alone, she said.

She said: 'There was a lot of debris in the water, as there commonly is with explosions.

'He
 was free floating in the water. A life raft was nearby but it didn't 
appear to have deployed properly and that was on fire too.

'The heat from the burning vessel was such that we could feel it when we were approaching.'

She
 said: 'It was lunchtime, I think he may have gone to the galley to make
 himself something to eat and the lacerations on his face and legs lead 
me to believe he was bending over a gas canister.

'If someone had killed him onboard, he wouldn't have been able to try and deploy his life raft.

'I have been living in Caribbean for long time and have helped rescue people in severe floods.

'When
 you attend you expect to help people. If you do encounter someone that 
you are unable to help, one thing that makes it more tolerable, was at 
least we were able to uncover Mr Garner's body for his family. '

Police say the life raft was found approximately 15 nautical miles west of Buccament in southwestern St. Vincent

Mr Garner's yacht, Asante, was found floating about 15 nautical miles off the coast of St. Vincent

Mr Garner's daughter Elisabeth, 37,  
told the MailOnline on Thursday that her family were unaware that her 
father's death was being treated as suspicious, and was instead a 
'tragic accident'.

She 
said she had spoken to her stepmother who had left St Vincent two days 
before Mr Garner, to head back to Norway and look after her young 
children.

She said: 'She always leaves before him.

'This
 is a shock for everybody. We have not been told that this is being 
treated as suspicious. As far as we have been told, it is being treated 
as a tragic accident.'

A 
sailing friend in Norway, where Mr Garner has lived for many years, said
 the divorced grandfather was ultra-fit and previously worked as a 
physical trainer for British special forces.

He had previously divorced from a Norwegian woman and had several children and grandchildren, the source said.

The
 friend said on Thursday: ‘It is very shocking news. He was a very nice 
man. He loved his yacht, Asante, and he was meticulous about the way he 
kept it. He had a military attitude towards things and was a strict 
sailing instructor.

‘He 
is what you would call an English gentleman. He trained the special 
forces in Britain, the SAS I believe, although he was a civilian and did
 not have a rank.

‘He 
loved sailing and I know Heidi went with him sometimes, although I never
 met her. He was often in the Caribbean and would then come back to 
Norway, where he had a house.’

The friend said they had previously spoken to Mr Garner about the dangers of travelling to St Vincent.

‘Me
 and John spoke about St Vincent many times. In the yachting society, St
 Vincent is somewhere you sailed straight past and did not stop at.

‘It was not a safe place, it was a place to avoid. People were worried about thefts and robberies and rapes.

‘Boat
 boys would try to help you to anchor, when you did not need help, and 
then charge you money. You paid them because you feared they would come 
back at night time.

‘I told John this but he would say that it was okay and that he did not have a problem with them.'

On Wednesday, pictures emerged of the burning boat, with plumes of black smoke billowing out.

The yacht, called Asante, was found floating about 15 nautical miles off the beautiful coastal resort of Buccament, south-west of the island, which boasts several five-star hotels.

The Asante was is described as 'a large ocean-going yacht of 49 feet and very pretty' with four sleeping cabins

Police said Mr Garner and Miss Hukkelaas had recently been granted permission to extend their stay on the island until April 19.

Mr Garner had previously advertised sailing trips around the British Virgin Islands for between £5,500 and £9,000.

The
 online advertisement offers a journey around a ‘beautiful area’ and 
lessons in navigation, boat handling and overboard practice, among other
 kills.

It states: ‘The instructor of Asante, John Edward Garner is Norwegian / English and he is also the owner of the boat.

‘Skipper
 and instructor John at Asante is a graduate of the English Yachtmaster 
system and Yachtmaster Ocean from England, and has sailed far.’

The boat is described as ‘a large ocean-going yacht of 49 feet and very pretty’ with four sleeping cabins.

The course was described as suitable for beginners and adheres to ‘British Royal Yachting Association’s rules’.

The
 murder comes just two months after retired management consultant Roger 
Pratt, 62, was murdered and his wife Margaret, 60, injured when robbers 
attacked their yacht as it lay moored off the Caribbean island of St 
Lucia.

The couple, from 
Warwickshire, had been on a dream voyage around the world on their 
£200,000 yacht, when they were ambushed at the port of Vieux Fort, at 
night.

Four men have been charged with Mr Pratt’s murder and theft and are awaiting trial.
