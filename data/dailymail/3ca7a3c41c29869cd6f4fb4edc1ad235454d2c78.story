This is the bizarre moment a carer tried to disguise herself as an 81-year-old Alzheimer’s sufferer in a bid to steal £22,000 from a pensioner’s bank account.  

Linda Cramphorn, 47, of Whetstone, Leicestershire, wore a curly brown wig, glasses and a green hat and jacket as she walked into a Halifax branch.  

She managed to withdraw £400 last June while pretending to be her elderly victim - but aroused suspicions in the staff when she asked for a £22,000 banker’s draft.

They alerted police who apprehended Cramphorn and her partner Sanjay Patel, 43, who maintained he was waiting for an elderly woman and that she was the OAP.  

Both defendants were jailed for 16 months, after admitting fraud by false representation at Leicester Crown Court yesterday. 

Judge Michael Pert QC described Cramphorn as a ‘conwoman’ and said: ‘This was cynical exploitation of the elderly.’  

‘You obtained work as a carer and were caring for an elderly, vulnerable lady and you took the opportunity to help yourself to various documents of hers to prove her identity and gain access to her finances. 

‘You set out to bleed her account dry. Having obtained £400, Cramphorn, disguised as an old woman, attempted to obtain £22,000.’

Cramphorn, who along with Patel comes from Whetstone, also carried a shopping bag and walking stick in an attempt to steal the money.  

She had been employed as a carer through Quorndon Care and admitted to stealing the victim’s personal documents and cheque book between February and June last year.  

Alan Murphy, prosecuting, confirmed his client had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in 2012 and needed help carrying out routine chores as her condition deteriorated.  

Her finances were being attended to by a relative with a power of attorney, who lives in Australia.  

Mr Murphy said: ‘Cramphorn went to the bank disguised as the complainant and someone who would pass as being 81.  

‘The cashier thought the woman who presented as the account holder looked a bit odd. All of it was caught on the bank’s CCTV.’  

The carer told bank staff she needed the money for a wedding and produced a utility bill she had taken from the pensioner.

‘The cashier was concerned as it seemed she wasn’t 81, as she was pretending to be,’ said Mr Murphy.  

When staff said that was insufficient identification, Cramphorn asked to withdraw £2,100 and supplied a false signature.

As she was unable to answer further security questions the money was not handed over, and she beat a hasty retreat, claiming to be unwell.  

Having left the pensioners saving’s account book in the bank she had to return and was subsequently arrested.  

On her person she had the pensioner’s cheque book, Nectar card and utility bills and a piece of paper with practice signatures of the victim’s name.  

The court was told Cramphorn had a criminal record but her last offence was committed as a juvenile.  

Patel, a warehouse worker, had previous convictions, which included obtaining and attempting to obtain services by deception, but had been out of trouble since 2000.  

In mitigation Olwen Davies, acting for both defendants, said: ‘It’s not disputed it involves breach of trust. There was ultimately no loss and they pleaded guilty early.’  

She said Cramphorn was ‘well thought of’ at work, but said: ‘It’s surprising she got this job, given her record.  

‘She suffers from mental instability and has been sectioned in the past and accepts custody is a likely outcome.’
