 

Real Madrid's attack is beginning to gel, prompting the Spanish press to label them as 'the best in the world'.

Carlo Ancelotti's side beat Levante 5-0 on Saturday, with Cristiano Ronaldo continuing his superb early-season form. The World Player of the Year now has 15 goals in seven league games. 

And, with Liverpool and Barcelona coming up this week, the Madrid papers are delighted to see the midfield of Isco, Luka Modric and James Rodriguez finding their feet.

Marca call Real Madrid 'the best attack in the world' while AS say Carlo Ancelotti's team are 'a steamroller'

While Marca says that 'Madrid impress', AS say the side a 'a steamroller', as both papers heap praise on record-breaking Ronaldo.

However, Madrid are still four points behind rivals Barcelona ahead of next weekend's El Classico after the Catalan club saw off Eibar 3-0.

In Italy, the focus is on Juventus, who were held to a draw by minnows Sassuolo despite a brilliant strike from Paul Pogba. 

La Gazzetta Sportiva and Corriere dello Sport both lead on Juve's 100% start to the season being stopped, as Roma narrow the gap to just a single point.

Simone Zaza put Sassuolo, bottom of the league going into the game, ahead, and despite Pogba's equaliser, Juventus couldn't find a winner.
