A commuter was attacked by a mob with a machete as he waited on a train platform after he refused to flash a gang sign.

Four men and three 15-year-olds - two boys and one girl - have been charged in connection to the assault, which left the 26-year-old victim with serious cuts to his head and neck.

The group approached the man as he waited with his 17-year-old brother at a train station in Chicago's Albany Park neighbourhood shortly after midnight on Monday.

Surrounded: CCTV footage taken from a security camera on the platform shows the attackers gathering around the two brothers as they sit waiting for their train shortly after midnight on Monday

Attack: Police said that the group asked the brothers, aged 26 and 17, to throw gang signs. When the brothers refused Mario Elvira, 18, took out a machete and began repeatedly striking the 26-year-old, pictured

Fleeing: The brutal assault only stopped when the next train pulled into the station on Chicago's North side. The police said that all seven attackers, pictured running from the platform, were caught shortly afterwards

The attackers surrounded the brothers as they sat waiting on a bench and asked them to flash gang signs. 

When the pair refused, saying they were not in a gang, one of the attackers pulled out a machete and struck the 26-year-old in the head.

Mario Elvira, 18, hacked the victim's head and neck as the rest of the group surrounded the bench.

Footage taken from a platform security camera showed that the assault continued until the next train pulled into the platform - causing the attackers to flee.

The 26-year-old victim was taken to Swedish Covenant Hospital where he remains in a stable condition. 

He suffered a deep gash to the head, which required 30 stitches. His 17-year-old was not injured in the attack.

Police caught the group, all from the North side of Chicago, shortly after the attack. 

Charged: Mario Elvira, 18, (left) and Kevin Ramirez, 19, (right) were both charged with robbery, aggregative battery and trespassing. Police said it was Elvira who attacked the 26-year-old victim with a machete

One neighbourhood group said told ABC7 Eyewitness News that the incident was surprising because gang activity had been in decline. 

Eric Filson, of Albany Park Neighbours, said: 'There's some tagging and occasional incidents of violence, but it's not part of a larger systemic trend.' 

Elvira, 23-year-old Jean Salvatierra, 19-year-old Kevin Ramierz and 20-year-old Kevar Preston were charged with robbery, aggregative battery and trespassing.

On bail: Jean Salvatierra, 23, (left) and Kevar Preston, 20, (right) were also charged with robbery, aggregative battery and trespassing. One of the 15-year-old boys was charged with aggravated assault and trespassing

One of the 15-year-old boys was charged with aggravated assault and trespassing. The two other 15-year-olds, a boy and a girl, face only trespassing charges.

Police have not released the names of the three teenagers.

The four adults are being held on bails between $250,000 and $450,000. They are next due in court on 15 September.
