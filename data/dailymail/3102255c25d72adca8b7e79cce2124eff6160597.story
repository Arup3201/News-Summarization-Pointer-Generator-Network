Several of Manchester United's under-fire squad put their troubled season behind them as they enjoyed a day out at Cheltenham on Wednesday.

As the Festival marked Ladies' Day, Daley Blind, Michael Carrick, Jonny Evans, Ashley Young, Phil Jones and Rafael were in good spirits as they watched the action unfold from the grandstand.

United's defeat to Arsenal in the FA Cup on Monday night ensured Louis van Gaal's side will end the campaign without a trophy and they also face a fight to finish in the top four and qualify for next season's Champions League.

Blind and Young started in the 2-1 defeat by Arsenal on Monday in which ex-United forward Danny Welbeck scored the winner after Wayne Rooney had cancelled out Nacho Monreal's opener.

Carrick and Jones were introduced from the bench but could not prevent the Gunners leaving Manchester with a place in the semi-finals. Evans missed outas he served the first of his six-match ban for spitting at Newcastle striker Pappis Cisse.

Rafael, meanwhile, who's future at the club is uncertain, starred for the Under 21 side on Tuesday with a stunning strike in the 1-1 draw with Tottenham.

The opening race on the second day at Cheltenham was won by Windsor Park before Don Poli triumphed in the RSA Chase.
