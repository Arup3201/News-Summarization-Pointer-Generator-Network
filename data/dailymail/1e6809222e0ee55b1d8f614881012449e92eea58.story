Celebrity chef and Food Network personality Paula Deen says that some people ‘were kinda mean’ about her diagnosis, after she publically revealed she has type-2 diabetes.

The queen of Southern cuisine drew ire from many in the health and culinary worlds when she announced that nearly three years before, she had been diagnosed with the disease.

But all the while, she was promoting highly caloric and indulgent dishes, and appeared to hold her announcement until she had a paying endorsement.

Hurtful words: Paula Deen said some people were 'kinda mean' after she announced her struggles with diabetes

‘Yes, I am being compensated,’ Deen told the Associated Press today at the South Beach Wine and Food Festival.

However, she calls the decision ‘the 
way of the world’ and ‘the American way.’

Deen said she received much criticism
from those around her. ‘I think a few people who have access to a TV 
camera and ink kind of wanted to hate on me for coming down with 
something,’ she told AP, adding that she’s simply shrugged it off.

Deen, now 65, revealed to the Today 
show’s Al Rocker last month that she has been struggling with the 
disease for more than two and a half years.

Spotted last month chowing down on a 
cheeseburger, Deen vows to eat healthier, but says it would be 
impossible to cut out all the butter and bacon from her famously 
indulgent recipes.

Love of food: Deen has said the one food she could not live without is butter

‘I am who I am,’ she told AP, ‘But what I will be doing is offering up lighter versions of my recipes.’

Deen added that she’s giving a
portion of the remuneration she recieves for endorsing the diabetes medicine to the American Diabetes Association.

She told the Today show that she has 
‘broad shoulders’ to deal with people’s negative comments and says her 
long life has been ‘a blessing.’

Type 2 diabetes is a long-term condition caused by too much glucose, a type of sugar, in the blood. It is often associated with obesity.

In those with the condition, the body is unable to break down glucose into energy as there is either not enough insulin to move the glucose, or because the insulin that is there does not work properly.

The symptoms, such as tiredness and weight loss, can be controlled by eating a healthy diet and monitoring the blood glucose level.

Insulin medication, usually in the form of tablets, also controls the condition.

Around 25 million in the United States have diabetes, with around 90 per cent having Type 2.

‘I feel like God has given me a 
blessing, because my mother and daddy died very young,’ she said. ‘I’m 
so proud that I lived long enough…to deal with something like this.’

The condition, linked to obesity, is a
result of genetic factors and lifestyle choices. It is a result of the 
body not producing enough insulin or failing to use it efficiently, 
allowing excess sugar to build up in the blood.

It can be managed by making lifestyle changes, such as exercising more and lowering blood sugars by altering the diet.

It
might come as little surprise that the condition has affected a chef 
whose signature dishes include bacon, egg and a burger between a 
doughnut.

And in an 
interview with the Today Show last year, the mother-of-two revealed she 
could never live without butter or her deep-fat fryer.

But speaking about her diagnosis, the 'Queen of Southern cuisine' said people should take her recipes with a pinch of salt.

'I've always encouraged moderation,' 
she said. 'People see me cooking all these wonderful, Southern, 
fattening recipes... it's for entertainment. People have to be 
responsible.'

Speaking with Al Roker, Paula revealed how she told Oprah Winfrey to exercise the same sort of responsibility.

Signature dish: One of Deen's recipes is a Lady's Brunch Burger that features doughnuts in place of buns, bacon, a beef burger and a fried egg

'Like I told Oprah, "Honey, I'm your cook, not your doctor,"' she said. 'You have to be responsible.'

When asked if her high-fat recipes can lead to diabetes, she said: 'That is part of the puzzle.'

She added that there are other factors, including genetics, lifestyle, stress and age.

'When your signature dish is hamburger 
in between a doughnut, and you've been cheerfully selling this stuff 
knowing all along that you've got type-2 diabetes, it's bad 
taste if nothing else.'

-Anthony Bourdain 

To deal with the condition, she is 'making lifestyle adjustments, including lightened-up versions of her favourite recipes'.

Although it was rumoured Paula had the condition in April 2010, last week was the first time she confirmed it.

In 2010, Paula earned just under $10 million from her television shows, recipe books, endorsements, retail sales and speaking fees, based on figures by New York Magazine. It suggests she could have earned around $30 million in the time since she was diagnosed.

Some of Paula's peers have questioned her judgement in keeping her own diagnosis quiet.

Fellow chef Anthony Bourdain, who is often outspoken on other cooking show celebrities, told Eater.com: 'When your signature dish is hamburger 
in between a doughnut, and you've been cheerfully selling this stuff 
knowing all along that you've got type-2 diabetes, it's bad 
taste if nothing else.'
