It's one of the more serious awards shows on the calendar - focusing on the people behind the big movies.

But small screen sirens Lea Michele and January Jones livened up the Directors Guild Awards on Saturday night.

Lea Michele showed some leg while January took the plunge in a daringly low cut top on the red carpet.

Two sirens: January Jones and Lea Michele brought the glamour on Saturday night to the DGA Awards at the Hyatt Regency Century Plaza in Los Angeles

The 28-year-old Glee star and the 37-year-old Mad Men star both presented awards at the untelevised event held at the Hyatt Regency Century Plaza.

The top award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Feature Film went to Mexican film director Alejandro G. Inarritu, 51, whose Birdman film has been an awards season favourite.

'I never expected to be here tonight talking to you, never in my life,' he said while accepting the award from last year's winner and fellow Mexico native Alfonso Cuarón who won last year for Gravity.

Feature film winner: Alejandro G. Inarritu took home the feature film directing award for his work on Birdman 

Alejandro was up against Richard Linklater for Boyhood, Clint Eastwood for American Sniper, Wes Anderson for The Grand Budapest Hotel and Morten Tyldum for The Imitation Game. 

January was the centre of attention as she took to the stage to present an award.

The television star mixed golden age of Hollywood glamour with modern style as she rocked a blue pantsuit with shiny trousers and coat.

January displayed her ample cleavage in a black blouse with a plunging neckline that reached her waist. 

Award nominee: Clint Eastwood accepted his nomination plaque from American Sniper star Bradley Cooper

She had her blonde hair up and away with soft curls swept to one side and tucked behind her ear.

Lea showed her sultry side in a clingy black spaghetti strap backless dress with thigh high slit.

The actress and singer had her long dark hair pulled back into a ponytail and accessorised with earrings and bracelets.

Birdman built on its recent awards from the acting and producing guilds that favoured the movie about a washed-up Hollywood actor played by 63-year-old Michael Keaton.

The guild presented awards in TV and movie categories and its feature film award winner has usually gone on to win the Academy Award in the corresponding category.

In the past 66 years the winner of the DGA Award for feature film director has gone on to win the Oscar for Best Director 59 times.

Oh goodie. Another event for us to gawp at. We just love awards season here in the Fashion Finder office. Tons of posh dresses, suave style, sharp tailoring and billowing dresses - it's just all so drool-worthy.

And despite shunning the typical red carpet gown here, January Jones looked amazing when she stepped out at the Directors Guild Awards in a swish suit.

She teamed her midnight blue pick with a daring plunge bodysuit that kept this otherwise androgynous ensemble feminine.

And while her exact suit isn't available at Sandro, there is an extremely similar pick up for grabs by the brand - just click right, then see below for the matching suit trousers. We've even popped her exact plunging bodysuit into the carousel to help you achieve the look too.
