A new book on the hidden life of Fidel Castro claims the Cuban leader lived in luxury on his own private island, which included a turtle farm.

It was thought that Castro, who is now rarely seen in public, lived a simple, austere life similar to his fellow Cubans in the communist country.

However, in the new book La Vie Cachée de Fidel Castro (Fidel Castro's Hidden Life), a former bodyguard says Castro never renounced 'capitalist comforts'.

Juan Reinaldo Sánchez, who worked for the leader for 17 years and now lives in America, says that the vast majority of his 
countrymen weren't aware of their leader's lavish lifestyle, which is in
 stark comparison to normal Cubans.

He claims that Castro had a private island, Cayo Piedra, south of the Bay of Pigs, describing it as a 'Garden of Eden', complete with a turtles and dolphin farm.

He adds that he reached the island by sailing there on his luxury private yacht, which featured rare Angolan wood and motors given by the Soviet president Leonid Brezhnev.

Other properties he owned included an estate in the Cuban capital Havana, with a rooftop bowling alley and medical centre as well as a bungalow with a private marina.

Mr Sanchez also claims that Castro always had at least 10 bodyguards, including two 'blood donors' wherever he went.

In the book Mr Sanchez says: 'Contrary to what he has always said, Fidel has never renounced capitalist comforts or chosen to live in austerity. Au contraire, his mode de vie is that of a capitalist without any kind of limits.'

He also added that while Castro was enjoying these luxuries, the Cuban economy was starting to collapse after the their main trading partner the Soviet Union began to disintegrate.

Mr Sanchez also recalled how Castro's favourite film was Soviet version of Tolstoy's War and Peace  and that his bodyguard wrote everything he did down in a notebook 'for history'.

He also says that most were also 
unaware of Castro's complicated love life and that he had nine children,
 as the Cuban media was forbidden from mentioning them.

The former bodyguard decided to help with the book, written by French journalist Axel Gyldén, after he claims fell out of favour with Castro and was imprisoned and after asking to retire.

He says he was thrown into jail 'like a dog' in a cockroach infested cell and tortured.

On his release, he then went to live in America, like many Cubans in the country.

The author Mr Gyldén told the Guardian: 'This is the first time someone from Castro's intimate circle, someone who was part of the system and a first-hand witness to these events, has spoken.

'It changes the image we have of Fidel Castro and not just how his lifestyle contradicts his words, but of Castro's psychology and motivations.'

In 2006, Forbes magazine listed the Cuban leader as one of the world' richest leaders but Castro denied the report.

Other journalists who have interviewed him say although he has the best food and healthcare, he does not lead a lavish lifestyle.

Castro ceded power to his brother Raul in 2008 after falling ill in 2006 and has kept a low profile in recent years.

It even fuelled rumours that he may have died, however he has made short occasional appearances although he is starting to look very frail.

In January, he appeared in public for the first time in nine months, when he attended the opening of an art studio in Havana.

But despite the change in leadership, Raul has is said to have made little change to Cuba.

Fidel Castro was born in Cuba in August 26 in a sugar plantation in the south-east of the island.

He went to the University of Havana to study law and intended to run in the 1952 election, which was then cancelled.

In 1953, he and brother Raul led an unsuccessful uprising against General Fulgencio Batista and he was sentenced to 15 years in prison.

He fled to Mexico on his release under an amnesty where he joined together with Argentinian Marxist Ernesto 'Che' Guevara.

In 1956, the pair and their insurgents began a guerilla war against the government, which was overthrown in 1958.

The next year Castro was sworn in as prime minister of Cuba and adopted a communist regime.

In the 1960s Castro allowed Soviets to build sites for nuclear missiles, when they came close to war with the United States, sparking the Cuban missile crisis.

In the following decades, Cuba struggled economically due to the collapse of the Soviet Union, one of their main trading partners.

Castro eventually stood down as leader of Cuba in 2008 following a bout of ill health, handing over power to his brother Raul.
