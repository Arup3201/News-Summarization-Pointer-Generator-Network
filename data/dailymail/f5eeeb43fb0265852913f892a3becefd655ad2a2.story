There are two players in the post-Tiger Woods era who have left Graeme McDowell feeling utterly helpless and wondering how on earth he can compete. One, of course, is his old friend Rory McIlroy. And the other is Dustin Johnson.

As it turned out, McDowell, like everyone else, didn’t have to worry about beating the American because he was too busy beating himself. Johnson vehemently denies a failed test for recreational drugs use prompted him to take a six-month leave of absence that caused him to miss the Ryder Cup last year.

Whether that is true or not, there were plenty of other party-style vices he did own up to that needed addressing and were enough by themselves to turn an obvious world top-three player into one struggling to stay in the top 20.

Johnson stands 6ft 4in and is such a naturally talented athlete he had every sporting coach at his college clamouring for him to specialise in their particular pursuit.

When he started making millions from golf, it was hardly surprising that temptation lay at every turn. Only Adam Scott attracted more swooning women than Johnson, but only Scott was wise enough to pick his way through the pitfalls. 

And now Johnson’s back. Will this turn out like another John Daly fable, where he returns but only to fall back into his old ways as quick as a lead can disappear on a pressure-filled Sunday?

Happily, all the signs point the other way. 

During the break, his fiancee Paulina Gretzky — whose ice hockey-playing father Wayne holds the same revered status in Canada that Kenny Dalglish holds in Liverpool — gave birth to their first child. When Johnson starting practising ahead of his return, his coach Butch Harmon couldn’t believe the difference mentally.

It’s showing on the golf course. Heck, he’s only played five events following that long break and he’s already had two second-place finishes and, on Sunday, a classy win in the WGC-Cadillac Championship at Doral. How’s that for talent?

It was all on show on the 18th hole on Sunday. The water hazard that juts out at 300 yards to the edge of the fairway and caught even McIlroy’s drive? 

Johnson cleared it comfortably. McIlroy hit a three-iron for his third shot; Johnson had an eight-iron. It was the eighth consecutive season in which Johnson has managed at least one victory. The next best sequence on the PGA Tour is Justin Rose’s five.

Just like the Northern Irishman, his game is built on devastating power and accuracy from the tee. Now 30, he has given McIlroy an enormous head start. Imagine the pair coming down the stretch at a major with one man having four Grand Slam wins to draw upon while the other is still awaiting his first?

But if you’re looking for the player who ought to run McIlroy the closest over the next few years, Johnson has the game. And now — finally — it looks like he might also have the brain.

‘I can hardly believe I’ve played a tournament without a single bogey. I didn’t think it was possible on this course.’

It was a good job it was possible for the impressive Korean Inbee Park, for it’s about the only way any of the women can beat 17-year-old Lydia Ko these days.

Park (second right) won the tournament by not firing a single bogey across the four rounds

Ko, wh became golf's youngest-ever world No 1 last month, finished the event in second place

Even so, 26-year-old Park still only won the HSBC Women’s Champions tournament in Singapore by two shots from the New Zealander, who has two wins and now this second place to her name since becoming golf’s youngest-ever world No 1 last month.

Sections of the American press are wondering why Rory McIlroy was given a largely free pass for tossing his three-iron into the water last week while the criticism that would have followed Tiger Woods, if he’d done it, ‘would have blown up the internet’.

So let’s see if we can explain the difference. At the age of 25 Woods never engaged with spectators, rarely signed autographs, was frequently seen spitting on the side of greens and treated the press with barely concealed contempt. 

McIlroy acknowledges the crowds, devotes hours of his time to signing autographs and spends way longer than he needs trying to give an insight to the media. Reap what you sow, it’s called.

American media has queried if Tiger Woods would have got more stick than McIlroy for throwing a club away

As for whether Tiger will be back for the Masters next month there is, of course, no word. No update on his progress, nothing. To turn the question around: could you ever imagine McIlroy acting like that?

The only thing we can say with a degree of certainty is that Friday is surely a big day if Woods is to turn up at Augusta. 

That’s the deadline for entering the Arnold Palmer Invitational next week — and if he doesn’t play in that event, one he’s won a remarkable eight times, it’s hard to envisage him playing the Masters.
