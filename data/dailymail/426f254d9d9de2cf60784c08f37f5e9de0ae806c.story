Prison: Mark Howe has been sentenced to life in prison after he stabbed his mother 53 times and left her to die

A care home worker obsessed with TV serial killer Dexter has been jailed after he admitted murdering his mother after the pair had rowed about his cannabis smoking.

Mark Howe repeatedly stabbed and slashed Katrina Wardle in the face, mouth, neck, chest and arms before leaving her to bleed to death on her bedroom floor in an 'appallingly savage' attack.

A judge said the brutal assault was 'akin to torture'.

The 21-year-old, who the court heard 'lived in a fantasy world', attacked Mrs Wardle, 48, at the family home in St Matthew’s, Leicester, in the early hours of July 16 last year.

Leicester Crown Court was told Howe was 'a recluse' obsessed with US TV series Dexter, which features a fictional police worker, Dexter Morgan, leading a double life as a serial knife-wielding killer.

He used a photograph of Dexter Morgan with a blood-splattered face as his own Facebook profile picture - and had searched ‘Dexter’s kill knife’ on the internet in the run-up to the killing.

Judge Mr Justice Haddon-Cave sentenced Howe to life in prison, and told him he would have to serve at least 21 years and six months before he could be considered for release.

He added: 'You attacked your mother with appalling savagery, causing more than 53 separate wounds. One can only imagine the horror of her realisation at what was being done to her by her own son.

'The sheer brutality and ferocity of the attack, which must have lasted some minutes, was akin to torturing her.

'She curled up in a foetal position, trying to protect herself.'

The court heard Howe carried out the 'horrifying act' with a 12-inch knife, the tip of which was bent by the force used.

Mr Justice Haddon-Cave said: 'She didn’t die immediately. The totality of the wounds caused her to bleed to death.

'A passer-by heard her pleading with you to stop, but you didn’t and left her to die.

'You told Facebook friends you hated your mother, and became hateful towards her.

'Her family and friends are still struggling to understand why you committed this terrible and unnatural act.'

The judge said he had been told, in mitigation, that Howe 'spent more and more time dwelling in a fantasy world' that seemed more real than his own.

Howe lived with his step-father, Kris Wardle, 51, an HGV driver, and his mother, known as Tina, who worked as a cleaner.

Nirmal Shant QC, prosecuting, said the couple noticed he became increasingly withdrawn, spending most of his time in his bedroom and rarely speaking.

Miss Shant said: 'He had a history of self-harming and using knives, which they took from his room.

'He’d used knives to cut holes in his bedroom walls and made stab marks in the door and his punch bag was stabbed repeatedly.'

'You attacked your mother with appalling 
savagery, causing more than 53 separate wounds. One can only imagine the
 horror of her realisation at what was being done to her by her own son'

- Judge Mr Justice Haddon-Cave

Miss Shant said Howe was 'obsessed with Dexter' - a blood spatter pattern analyst for the Miami Police Department who hunts down and kills criminals he believes deserve retribution.

He told a friend in one message that he wished he was Dexter.

Miss Shant said Howe had downloaded reports on murder weapons, after searching for 'Dexter’s kill knife' and also searched for 'What does a sociopath need to do to blend seamlessly with society?'

The court heard that on the day before the murder, Mr Wardle set off for work, expecting to be away overnight. Howe went to work at a care home before returning home at 3.30pm and going to his room.

Mrs Wardle left for her cleaning job at 7.20pm, returning home an hour later.

At about 2.30am the next day - Tuesday, July 16 - a next door neighbour heard a woman either screaming or crying.

A man passing by heard a female voice saying: 'Oh please, please don’t do it.'

When interviewed by police after his arrest, Howe said he could not remember anything.

Miss Shant said: 'He says he was in the bathroom covered in blood and when he looked through a gap in the door he could see his mother on the floor covered in blood.'

Howe rang his older sister after the killing, asking if he could come to see her, saying he had been in a fight with a man and had badly cut his hand.

'His instructions remain that he can’t remember why or how he would have done such a thing, but he acknowledges he must have'

Having showered, he left the house taking a bag of clothes.

He disposed of a blood-stained grey top near a park, then used his mother’s bank card to withdraw £100 from a cashpoint before going to a branch of McDonald’s, in Leicester city centre, to wash his hands.

Howe then went to the Leicester care home where he worked and told staff he’d been attacked by his step-father.

He left and went to another care home where he also had a job, on the way confessing to his sister, over the phone, that he had killed their mother after an argument about him smoking cannabis.

He arrived at the second care home, initially claiming to have been in a fight.

The police were called and he was arrested.

Miss Shant said Howe’s sister, on hearing her mother had been stabbed, immediately contacted her step-father, who was in Barnsley.

US TV series Dexter features a fictional police worker, Dexter Morgan, a blood spatter pattern analyst for the Miami Police Department, who leads a secret life hunting down and killing criminals he believes deserve retribution.

Orphaned at the age of three, Dexter was and adopted by a Miami police officer who recognised he had homicidal tendencies.

He was then taught to channel his passion for human dissection into killing only heinous criminals.

The show has run for eight seasons and is set in Miami.

He asked his father, Brian Wardle, to go to the house to see what had happened.

Miss Shant said: 'When he got into the bedroom he could immediately see she was beyond help. She was dead.'

Rosina Cottage QC, mitigating, said Howe had no previous convictions and had a schizoid personality disorder, although he was not suffering from diminished responsibility at the time of the offence.

She said there was 'some pre-meditation' involved shortly before he got the knife from the kitchen and took it upstairs.

'His instructions remain that he can’t remember why or how he would have done such a thing, but he acknowledges he must have,' she said.

'He’s emotionally distant, but he does appear to be shocked by the magnitude of the offences and by what he’s done.'

After the case, Mr Wardle said in a statement: 'Katrina was my Pole Star, immutable and persistent, always guiding, always shining brightly.

'She was the force that held me to the ground, the force that let me fly free above the world.'

Detective Chief Inspector Siobhan Ashford, of Leicestershire Police, who led the investigation, said: 'This incident has destroyed a family and left many people devastated by the events.

'His actions have left ever-lasting consequences and he now faces a life behind bars.'
