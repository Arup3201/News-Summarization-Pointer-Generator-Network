It seems New York City cats are more competitive than we might think.

Weeks after a cat survived a 14-storey fall from her owner’s Manhattan flat, another has gone one better by recovering from a 20-storey plunge.

Gloucester, 16, survived the amazing fall from an Upper West Side flat last Monday, in the same area where Copper, nine, slipped out last month.

Gloucester fell onto the pavement below but managed to escape without even chipping a tooth or breaking a bone, reported the New York Post.

'In six years we've lived in the apartment I've never seem him interested in the window,' his owner, Barry Myers, 44, told MaiIOnline.

'I think something may have flown by and he took a swipe at it with his paw. The vets expect him to make a total recovery, but he's still a little wobbly.'

It's been an emotional few weeks for Mr Myers, as Gloucester's recovery came around the same time as the cat's brother Al died last week.

Owner: Barry Myers, his wife Miranda Schubert and their five-year-old son were away in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, when the incident happened

Mr Myers had left the window slightly open at his flat before leaving for Cape Cod, Massachusetts, on the 4th July weekend with his wife and son.

But the web developer never thought the 
cat would get through the six-inch gap and said he is ‘killing himself’ for
opening the window now.

A cat sitter raised the alarm when she was not greeted by Gloucester at the door, and went downstairs to find him unconscious.

A doorman and tenant were huddled around the cat and he was taken to an emergency vet.

Gloucester’s vet Richard Fried said he was lucky to be alive because most cats would die or suffer serious injuries from such a big fall.

Another fall: Nine-year-old cat Copper survived a fall from 14 stories last month after slipping off a ledge near a window at a different Upper West Side flat

‘He made a miraculous recovery,’ Mr Fried told the New York Post.

It comes after nine-year-old cat Copper survived a fall from 14 stories last month after slipping off a ledge near Upper West Side resident Angela Lang's window.

Vets at the Bergh Memorial Animal Hospital in New York say they often see up to five cases a week of cats falling out of windows in the summer.
