Maybe it was the war in Iraq, or the global financial crisis or even his dubious grasp of the English language that made President George W. Bush so unpopular.

Whatever the reason it appears that more than half of Americans view former leader 'unfavorably', making him the most disliked living U.S president.

According to a CNN poll released yesterday just 43 per cent of people questioned said they have a good opinion of Bush, while 54 per cent said the opposite.

Not winning popularity contests any time soon: George W. Bush is the least liked living former president

In contrast two-thirds of Americans said they have a positive view of Bush's predecessor, former President Bill Clinton reports The Huffington Post.

Strategy: Obama is using Bush's unpopularity to his advantage on the campaign trail

Bush's meager rating is roughly the same as it was in 2010 which is higher than it was immediately following his tenure in the White House in 2009, when his favorable rating bottomed out in the high 20s.Strategists say the new ratings could help direct President Barack Obama's campaign before the November election.

Obama has spent last few months blaming Bush for the economic crisis, the soaring federal debt and two unfinished wars.CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said:  'Don't be surprised if the Obama campaign mentions the name of George W. Bush at every opportunity, and don't be surprised if that strategy works.

'And the mention of Bush's name appears to prompt at least a few people to take a more positive view of their current financial situation.'The poll also reaffirms the Obama's decision to use Clinton to help campaign for Democrats in tough races around the U.S.
