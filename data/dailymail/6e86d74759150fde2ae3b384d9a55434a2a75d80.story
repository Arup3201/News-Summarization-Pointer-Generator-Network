The murderer who gunned down two NYPD police officers in December was betrayed by his friends, passed around from home to home as a teenager and was sexually abused as a child.

Ismaaiyl Brinsley killed Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu as they sat in their marked patrol car in the Bedford-Stuyvenstant district of Brooklyn on December 20 before shooting himself.

The 28-year-old's vile act was in part motivated by the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown at the hands of police officers, but his friends have struggled to understand what led him to commit such an atrocity.

His unstable upbringing and emotional turmoil leading up to December 20 may be to blame.

The New York Times revealed that his friends betrayed him in May when they pistol-whipped him and robbed him while the girlfriend he was madly in love with dumped him around Thanksgiving, prompting him to try and take his own life. 

He was also passed around from home to home as a teenager and abandoned by his parents.

When he was 14 years old, he tried to kill himself after being sexually abused while he lived a virtually homeless existence.

Upbringing: When he was 14 years old, he tried to kill himself after being sexually abused while he lived a virtually homeless existence

Before the shooting, after breaking up with girlfriend Shaneka Thompson, 29, he also threatened to hang himself, and had been disowned by his mother and two sisters for being violent and aggressive. 

A friend known as Mike Summerz on Instagram told the paper: 'I knew he had a lot on his mind.' 

Another close friend, Althea Hood, who saw him in early December during a visit to Atlanta also told the Times: 'I can't even understand why. Other than, what he did in the beginning with his girlfriend might have been a mistake, and then he lost it.'

He struggled with depression but did not have hallucinations and, unlike his older brother, did not have schizophrenia.  

As a teenager he would spend spells living on the couches of any relative who was willing to take him.

He travelled around the country and ended up being so estranged from his mother Shakuwra Dabre that she didn't know where he went to school. She split with Brinsley father when he was just nine years old. 

Brinsley became a thief in adulthood and was arrested 20 times while squatting anywhere he could. The charges included concealing a weapon, disorderly conduct, and trespassing.

In a bid to kickstart his life, he tried to start two T-shirt companies - one selling designs with naked women on the front and another with state outlines emblazoned on the chest. Both of them failed.  

On social media he would pose in pictures wearing fashionable clothes and accessories, most of which were stolen. 

He also strived to be a ladies man, having a child with a woman who wanted to be a model at the age of 21.  

On Myspace, which he used when he was 21 and 22, Mr. Brinsley posted photographs of himself holding wads of cash, with a pistol tucked into his jeans, in an album called 'Grown, Gorgeous And Gangsta.' 

Turmoil: Close friends said he was deeply in love with Shaneka Thompson who had broken up with him on Thanksgiving. He shot her in the stomach on the day the two officers were killed

Brinsley often took to social media to show off images of his clothes and weapons. Just weeks before the deadly attack he uploaded this picture on Instagram 

Thompson, 29, had dated Brinsley within the past year according to Baltimore County cops, although Delly said he knew nothing about the relationship and said he was 'shocked' that she would have had anything to do with a copkiller.

Brinsley, 28, shot Thompson in the abdomen shortly before 6am in her upscale apartment in the Greenwich Place development, which overlooks the Owings Mill AMC Cinema's parking lot.

He used the same silver 9mm semi-automatic handgun that killed NYPD officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu as they sat in their marked patrol car in the Bedford-Stuyvenstant district of Brooklyn.

Police found a bullet in the apartment that matched those used to kill the police officers. 

NYPD officers have traveled to Maryland to interview her in a bid to find out what triggered Brinsley's murderous spree, but have not yet been able to speak to her because of the severity of her wounds.

Brinsley stole Thompson's cellphone after he had shot her.

It was the location 'pings' from that phone that let police know he was on his way to New York. 

Just moments before gunned down the officers, he asked passersby to follow him on Instagram and said 'watch what I'm going to do' before killing the two men. 

Speaking at a press conference the day after their deaths NYPD Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce said: 

Brinsley became a thief in adulthood and was arrested 20 times while squatting anywhere he could. The charges included concealing a weapon, disorderly conduct, and trespassing

'His mother ... states he had a very troubled childhood and was often violent. His mother expressed fear of him and she hasn't seen him in one month.

'Brinsley attempted suicide in the past and attempted to hang himself a year ago.'

He has been linked with crime before, and has served jail time in Georgia and Ohio. It also emerged today that has admitted to suffering mental health problems in the past.

During a court hearing in Georgia's Cobb County in 2011, Brinsley was asked whether he had been in an institution or undergone treatment by mental health professionals, according to the New York Times.

He answered yes. 

A close friend of Brinsley's - Las Vegas janitor Jay Romero - described the shooter as 'intelligent' and 'funny'. 

He also said confirmed Brinsley was in deeply love with Thompson, 29, who he shot in the stomach near Baltimore, Maryland before heading to New York.
