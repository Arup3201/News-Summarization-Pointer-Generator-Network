The Bank of England may cut interest rates to below its current record low of 0.5% in the coming months to try to revive Britain's depressed economy.

Members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) opted to pump more emergency cash into the economy earlier this month, but not before discussing in more detail the possibility of a first cut in rates since March 2009, it was revealed today.

Detailed minutes show while they ultimately opted to increase its quantitative easing (QE) programme to £375 billion, its members agreed to consider cutting interest rates below 0.5%.

This would good news for millions of people with variable mortgages but a bitter blow for even more savers and pensioners.

Struggling: The Bank of England will pump a further 50 billion pounds into the British economy to try to improve the nation's slumping economy but may also cut interest rates this year

IMF boss Christine Lagarde has already urged the
Bank to lower its base rate and use more quantitative easing to
help the UK weather the 
eurozone debt crisis.

The minutes of the MPC’s July meeting, released today, 
said the impact of the recently unveiled funding for lending scheme 
might 'alter' the committee’s assessment of such a rate reduction.

The £80 billion funding for lending 
scheme was launched last Friday by the Bank and the Treasury in a bid to
free up the logjam in credit hitting the economy, by offering banks 
cheap finance on the condition they pass it on to borrowers.

Under the scheme, British banks are 
being offered funding at low interest rates over a four-year period - 
but it will be directly linked to bank lending performance to encourage 
lenders to increase loan availability and reduce rates.

Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: 'Members 
signalled that a rate cut was still possible further ahead, although 
only after the effects of the funding for lending scheme become 
apparent.'

The minutes also show the Bank voted unanimously to hold 
rates at 0.5% this month, while seven members backed the QE boost and 
two - Spencer Dale and Ben Broadbent - voted to hold the stock at £325 
billion

The economy is in a double-dip recession after contracting by 0.3% in the first quarter of 2012 and declining 0.4% in the final three months of last year.

Meanwhile, inflation has pulled back from 5.2% last September as the impact of the VAT hike fades and energy and commodity prices fall.

The near-term picture for growth is “somewhat weaker” than the Bank’s assessment last May, the Bank’s minutes added, and the UK is now potentially facing a period of two years where there has been 'little or no economic growth'.

Survey data continued to weaken in the month before the meeting, the MPC said, while there were increasing signs that the threat of the eurozone crisis was hitting UK growth.

The minutes added: 'Information during the month suggested export prospects had weakened, which would further impede the UK economy’s rebalancing away from domestic demand towards net exports.#

The minutes said the committee had considered the case for a cut to interest rates at its previous meeting in June - but added that such a move had drawbacks that made it 'less attractive' than a QE boost.

But the committee said it would 'review this option' when the impact of the funding for lending scheme was more apparent, although this was unlikely to be for several months.
