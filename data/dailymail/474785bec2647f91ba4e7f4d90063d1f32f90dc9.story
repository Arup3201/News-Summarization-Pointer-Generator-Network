A self-catering holiday close to home could be hard to beat this summer.

Take family or friends away to discover shell-studded beaches that stretch for miles, heaps of historical gems swathed in myths and legends, and locations from favourite TV shows - think Poldark and Doc Martin in charming Cornwall, and Broadchurch in dazzling Dorset.

Self-catering has come a long way, as competition and regulation drives owners to ever-higher standards.

So most cottages are now stylish sanctuaries - perfect to flop down in after sorties along the coastal path or up into the hills. And it's not just about the flexibility to feed yourselves and set your own schedule.

Snaptrip has seen a 25 per cent increase in people searching for somewhere to stay close to foodie delights - renowned pubs, Michelin-starred restaurants, food fairs and markets.

And there has been a 35 per cent increase in people booking activities alongside their stay - from sailing in Hampshire and Dorset, to cycling in the Brecon Beacons or horse riding in the new Forest and Scotland.

A bargain struck on accommodation will free up your budget for plenty of treats, experiences and explorations.

Neither are you confined to a full week's stay. 'There has been a marked shift towards short breaks taken within two hours' drive of home,' says Simon Altham, managing director of Hoseasons. 

'Nearly two-thirds of our business (62 per cent) focuses on short breaks of three or four nights.'

The choice has widened, with a growing demand for luxury lodge breaks that offer families, friends and couples that little bit extra - stylish, modern living spaces in beautiful countryside settings, with free wi-fi, en-suite facilities and private hot tubs on the decking. 

And holiday parks have had a modern facelift, sprouting upmarket facilities, sailing and surfing lessons and trendy restaurants.

So whether for a short break, Easter egg-scape or that full week or two's holiday, self-catering promises fun and freedom this summer.

Disney's Cinderella, released on March 27, updates the classic rags-to-riches tale by featuring humble Cinders's personal journey as she wins over the heart of her prince.

Looking for a dramatic location? South Foreland Lighthouse, at Dover, is perched on the White Cliffs, with outstanding views of the French coastline and ships passing in the Channel. 

National Trust Holidays' East Cottage, adjoining the lighthouse, is very close to the Trust's newest attraction, opening this spring - the Fan Bay Deep Shelter and Sound Mirrors.

The earliest sound mirror dates back to 1917, created as one of the first early warning systems to give notice of approaching enemy aircraft.

With surveys showing a quarter of British children spend just half an hour a week outdoors, adventurer and TV presenter Ben Fogle is to lobby Parliament this year to galvanise support for his Call of The Wild campaign, promoting forest school camps.

A self-catering stay can be equally outdoorsy. Toad Hall Cottages suggests The Shippen, one of a group of cottages on a farm near Honiton, Devon.

Here children can run through fields, splash in rivers, build campfires, make dens, or help collect eggs and feed resident pigs and smaller farm animals.
