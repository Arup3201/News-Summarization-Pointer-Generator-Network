Married comedian Jason Manford has been caught exchanging explicit messages with a female fan just two years after quitting his BBC job because of an online sex scandal, it has been reported.

TV star Jason, who appeared on Jonathan Ross' show last Saturday gushing about his 'lovely family', allegedly contacted the 32-year-old woman several times.

Father-of-three Manford is even said to have received a topless message from the woman.

New online shame: Jason Manford has reportedly been exchanging messages with a female fan - more than two years after the first scandal (pictured here in October last year)

Means of communication: The messages were allegedly received by Manford on social networking site Facebook

The 31-year-old comedian's latest shame allegedly began when he was messaged through Facebook by a fan.

According The Sun the
pair exchanged 'hundreds of messages' from November 2011 to March 2012 
after the woman told Manford, who has been married to his actress wife Catherine since 2007, that  her son was a fan of his.

There is no suggestion the pair ever met up or spoke on the phone.

A spokesperson for the comedian declined to comment on the claims when contacted by MailOnline.

Manford's flirtation with the stranger
continued until she eventually sent him a picture of her in the bath 
which reportedly led the comic to send her sexually explicit messages.

A
friend of the woman told The Sun: 'She was taken aback by the messages.

'At first they were very innocent. But then he started calling her 
gorgeous and nicknamed her his mistress.'

Although the sex messages from the star cooled off in March 2012, sources say they started again in January this year.

This is the latest embarrassment for 
Manford, who was forced to quit as The One Show host in November 2010 
after it emerged he was sending sexual messages to fans.

He later vowed to become 'a good husband forever.'

Confessing to his Twitter sex shame in 2010, Manford vowed to be the perfect husband and pleaded with his wife to forgive him.

He gave interviews saying how sorry he was but added his wife felt their relationship was worth fighting for.

Manford
admitted having internet sex sessions with a porn star and 12 fans and 
later left the One Show to concentrate on tour commitments.

It
will be fresh embarrassment for Manford who is busy promoting his First
World Problems tour, which will run until January 2014.

Comic Manford is believed to have earned more than £2million since he hit the big time on Channel 4's 8 Out Of 10 Cats.
