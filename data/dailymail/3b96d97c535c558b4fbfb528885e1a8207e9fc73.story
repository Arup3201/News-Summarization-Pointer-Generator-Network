Every family in Britain could be £380 better off from a landmark trade deal between the United States and Europe.

David Cameron hailed the ‘biggest bilateral trade deal in history’ at the launch of negotiations for an agreement which could be worth £100 billion to the European Union economy.

In the first major announcement of the G8 summit in Northern Ireland, Mr Cameron and US President Barack Obama removed their ties to strike a casual look at the Lough Erne resort.

Casual: The start of formal talks on an EU-US trade deal was announced by European Council President Herman Van Rompuy, US President Barack Obama, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and UK Prime Minister David Cameron

Mr Cameron had been keen to use this 
week's summit in start the formal talks to strike a deal which Downing 
Street claims could be worth up to £10billion to the UK alone.

Speaking
at a press conference, the Prime Minister said talks to break down 
trade barriers between the EU and the United States could create two 
million extra jobs and would help to ‘fire up’ global economies.

He
added: ‘There is no more powerful way to achieve that than by boosting 
trade and there's no better way than by launching these negotiations on a
landmark deal between the European Union and the United States of 
America, a deal that could add as much as G£100 billion to the EU 
economy, £80 billion to the US economy and as much as £85 billion to the
rest of the world.

We are talking about what could be the
biggest bilateral trade deal in history. A deal that will have a 
greater impact than all the other trade deals on the table put 
together.’

Contrast: President Obama chose to don a jacket at the press conference (left) but there was no sign of the tie he wore on a visit to a school in Enniskillen

Change: The Prime Minister looked smart at he visited the school but opted to go tieless and jacketless for the press conference at the G8

The announcement does not mean a deal has been struck, but signals what could be months of thrashing out the details of an agreement to make it easier for businesses in the EU and the US to trade with each other.

America will host the first round of negotiations next month, President Obama said as he hailed the ‘potentially groundbreaking partnership’.

He warned against ‘downgrading ambition’ in a rush to strike an agreement, insisting both sides had to be bold.

He added: ‘I am hopeful we can achieve the kind of high standards comprehensive agreement that the global trading system is looking to us to develop.

‘America and Europe have done extraordinary things together before and I believe we can forge an economic alliance as strong as our diplomatic and security alliances.’

President Obama said it was important that the US and EU ‘get it right’.

‘That means resisting the temptation to downgrade our ambition or avoid tough issues just for the sake of getting a deal.’

The president said the leaders would be giving a ‘mandate’ to their negotiators, but added that it was likely they would have to step in personally to resolve particularly difficult issues.

Their appearance at the press conference kickstarting the G8 summit was in stark contrast to an earlier visit by Mr Cameron and Mr Obama to a local school where, still wearing ties, they joined in with an art session.

The two leaders visited Enniskillen 
Integrated Primary School as they prepared for the formal start of the 
two-day summit being held in the Northern Irish town from this 
afternoon.

En route in the 
president’s armoured car, known as The Beast, the pair discussed the 
fraught issues facing global leaders gathered in the UK for the annual 
talks, most notably the serious split in the international community 
over the Syria crisis.

They 
were resuming the discussions in the vehicle on the return journey to 
the luxury golf resort on the shores of Lough Erne which is hosting the 
summit.

It was all smiles as
they chatted with pupils in a classroom of the modern school building -
which educates equal numbers of Catholic and Protestant pupils.

Message: Mr Cameron wrote 'with thanks for all you do' while Mr Obama added 'dream top dreams'

It is the only integrated primary school in County Fermanagh - and was set up by a cross-community group in the wake of the 1987 Remembrance Day Provisional IRA bombing in the town which killed 11 and injured 63.

At present, only 6% of primary and secondary schools are integrated and the importance of mixed-faith education was one of the central messages of Mr Obama’s speech about the peace process in Belfast this morning.

The politicians, who were shown around by 11-year-olds John Sammon and Meabh Mackin, also signed a G8 tapestry.

But the pair’s friendly rivalry - previously seen at table tennis, among other arenas - was soon on show when they joined a group in the playground finishing the large artwork.

“Do you think you can handle this David?,” the US president joked as he pointed the Prime Minister towards a section to paint.

Mr Obama was soon admitting he was in trouble for “going outside the lines” - securing an assurance from pupils that he would not be punished.

But it was Mr Cameron who received praise from the teacher - and three cheers from the pupils - for finishing his section first and not straying beyond the boundaries in his work.

“I didn’t realise David was going to move so fast,” Mr Obama joked.

But he refused to admit defeat, insisting: “I’m not as good as these guys but I’m better than David.”

The leaders - both wearing blue ties but with Mr Cameron in a blue shirt to the president’s white - first signed their names on a G8-themed patchwork quilt.

Mr Obama wrote ‘Dream Big Dreams’ while the Prime Minister added ‘With thanks for all you do’ under his signature.

Moving on to the classroom, they were treated to a show of the youngsters’ knowledge of the summit.

The leaders went to the playground to engage in their artistic contest - the President choosing to colour in with blue paint the initial ‘E’ of Enniskillen on the giant artwork spread across several tables while the Prime Minister took on the second ‘n’.

Within seconds, Mr Obama admitted: ‘I think I’ve gone outside the lines.’

He was later told that not only had he failed to match Mr Cameron’s neatness but had not managed to complete his colouring task either.
