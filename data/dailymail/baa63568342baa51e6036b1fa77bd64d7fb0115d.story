A classic Ferrari has been sold at auction for a record breaking £17.6million which will be donated to charity.

The Ferrari 275 GTB/4*S NART Spyder was sold by the family of businessman and philanthropist, Eddie Smith, who died in 2007.

Bought by Mr Smith in 1967 for £5,000, the unique sports car attracted global attention with experts predicting it could fetch £10million when it went under the hammer at RM Auctions' sale in Monterey, California on Saturday.

The classic Ferrari was purchased by Mr Smith in 1967 for £5,000. Its sale this weekend beats the last record for sale of a Ferrari by £6 million

But being one of only 10 of its kind ever made, it sold for a staggering £6million more than the previous world record auction price for a Ferrari.

The car was so desirable at its time of production that notorious fan Steve McQueen owned one, and requested that another be used in the filming of The Thomas Crown Affair.

Bidding started at $16million and 
went up in $1million increments with the hammer finally going down at 
$25million (£16m) on Saturday. 

The total price paid, including premiums, was $27.5million (£17.6m).

It is not known who the buyer is, only that the car will be shipped to Switzerland as part of a private collection.

James Cottingham who was at the auction said a sale of this kind in the public domain meant that many potential owners came out of the woodwork

The car boasts a 330bhp V12 engine. In 1967 it reached a top speed of 160mph, an extraordinary figure for a car of that era

James Cottingham, a vehicle acquisition specialist at classic Ferrari specialist, DK Engineering in Hertfordshire, was at the auction.

He said: 'A NART spyder is not only rare but exceptionally desirable and extremely capable.

'The offering of this car in such a public domain meant that many potential owners came out of the woodwork.'

'Added to the obvious appeal of the 
car itself the additional moral benefit of this sale certainly helped 
such a high price be achieved.

'It's rare that 100 per cent 
of the proceeds of a car sale will go to charity. What is even more 
extraordinary is that the donation is so sizeable.

It is a very noble commitment by the vendor.'

It is not known who the car's new owner is, only that the it will be shipped to Switzerland as part of a private collection.

Ferrari only built the Spyder after US dealer Luigi Chinetti persuaded them to manufacture it in limited numbers. Journalists described it as 'the most satisfying sports car in the world' when it was built
