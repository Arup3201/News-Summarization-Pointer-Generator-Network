Parminder Janagle, (pictured at court today) an award-winning property developer, has been jailed today for six months for running a brothel

An award-winning property developer has today been jailed for six months for running a brothel. 

Parminder Janagle was lauded as part of a new breed of ‘socially-aware’ 
landlords after successfully turning around a struggling portfolio of 12
buy-to-let properties in 2009.

But the 49 year old entrepreneur - who was previously pictured at an awards evening with TV beauty Konnie Huq - was caught after police raided a house in the Edgbaston area of Birmingham to find scantily-clad women working there.

A court heard Janagle, who used to earn £70,000-a-year, received a police caution for running the brothel in January last year but was caught doing the same thing after another raid on March 4.

Despite the married father of two not being prosecuted, the address was raided again on May 25 where police discovered him in a lounge - as well as several women having sex with men in other rooms.

Today Janagle, from Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, was jailed for six months at Birmingham Magistrates Court after he admitted running a brothel.

District Judge Neil Davison told him: 'You were managing a brothel in January last year and you were cautioned. 

'There's no doubt you knew exactly what you were doing but you carried on.

'So a warrant was executed in March and that warrant revealed you were behaving exactly as previously.

'When another warrant was issued two months later, you were doing exactly the same thing as before.

'Nobody forced you to do that, you did it because you chose to.

'You were receiving a financial gain from this because of the services provided by the girls in your brothel.'

Helen Shipley, prosecuting, told the court Janagle had been previously arrested for the same crime but escaped with a caution in January 2012.

Speaking about the third time police raided Janagle in May last year, Ms Shipley said: 'As the police approached the flat they recognised a lady they had encountered on the previous occasion.

'And when they got into the flat again they found a naked male and a naked female engaging in sexual acts.

Janagle had been credited with turning round his property business after being introduced to self-made millionaire Gill Fielding in 2009, who had recently appeared on Channel 4's Secret Millionaire programme

'They also found another man and a woman engaging in sexual activity in another room.'And discovered in the lounge was the defendant. The defendant was arrested and gave no comment in interview this time.'

Janagle had been credited with turning round his property business after being introduced to self-made millionaire Gill Fielding in 2009 - who had recently appeared on Channel 4's Secret Millionaire programme.

The turnaround of his business hit national headlines and he became a Landlord of the Year Finalist.

It was at that awards ceremony that he was pictured with former Blue Peter presenter Konnie Huq at Birmingham's NEC. 

But as the economic crisis began to bite, Janagle’s property empire was 
driven on to the rocks and he was eventually made bankrupt.

At previous hearings the fallen businessman - who claimed he was separated from his wife at the time -  told a court how he turned to the sex industry 
after falling under the spell of an individual ‘in that line of business
‘

Christopher Stapleton, defending, said:  'He accepts he has made a substantial error of judgement.'
