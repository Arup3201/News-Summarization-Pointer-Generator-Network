A woman was taken to hospital in a fire engine after being cut free from a car crash because there were no ambulances available.

Saira Khalid, 22, was trapped inside her brand new BMW One Series after colliding with another car in Preston, Lancashire, and had to wait 90 minutes for an ambulance which never turned up.

But firefighters came to the rescue by driving her the one-mile journey to the Royal Preston Hospital on a spinal stretcher.

Firemen cut off the roof off Saira Khalid's new car while they waited for an ambulance to take her to hospital

A bystander, who phoned 999 twice in a desperate attempt to summon paramedics, said: 'It was unbelievable.

'The woman was in distress and complaining of neck pain. The fire brigade were brilliant in the way they dealt with it. But no-one could believe an ambulance didn’t show.'

Miss Khalid, a customer services advisor from Ribbleton, Lancashire, had to be cut out of her vehicle after colliding with a Volkswagen on Wednesday evening.

The fire crew cut the top off the vehicle and removed her using a spinal board  and neck support, before securing her on the engine’s floor to transport her to  safety.

Her sister Nadia Hussain, 34, said: “I can’t praise the fire crew enough. They stayed with her, supporting her head all that time.

'The police made several phone calls to the ambulance. The fire service were  also talking to them. But we waited and waited and nothing happened.

'In the end the fire crew decided they needed to get her to hospital, so they lifted her up and slid the spinal board into the back of the fire engine and off they went.'

North West Ambulance Service said it has now started an inquiry into why an emergency crew didn’t attend the scene.

A spokesman said: 'Our initial views are that it was down to the numbers of life-threatening and serious cases we were dealing with at the time.

'There isn’t an awful lot we can say at the moment as this incident is being investigated.'

Miss Khalid, who is now recovering at home, suffered just bruising in the accident and X-rays at the hospital showed she didn’t have any spinal damage or broken bones.

Her sister said: 'When I got to the scene I was shocked to see her trapped inside the car.

'I lost another sister in a traffic accident at the age of four and it brought all that trauma back. My first thought was: "Oh my God, not again."

'We’re all relieved Saira is OK. I don’t blame the paramedics, I blame the Government for cutting back so much on the emergency services.

'There may have been other 999 calls to deal with that night, but you’d like to think there are enough ambulance crews to deal with every one of them. It shouldn’t be up to firefighters to take their place.'

A local resident who lives yards from the accident scene said: 'The poor girl was crying and clearly in pain and shock. She was cold, as well.

'We all waited, expecting an ambulance to come. But after 90 minutes they still hadn’t shown, so the fire brigade took her to hospital. We’re all glad she’s OK.'

A spokesman for Lancashire Fire and Rescue said: 'The driver had neck pain, arm injuries and burns from the airbag, so we asked for an ambulance to attend.

'But there were no ambulances available in Preston at that time, they were all  dealing with higher priority cases.

Our crew stayed with her to see if an ambulance would arrive. But later the ambulance service contacted us and asked if we could take her to hospital, which we did.

'It is quite rare for this to happen, although it isn’t unheard of. It is not something we do without getting permission from the ambulance service to move the casualty.

'On this occasion they were very busy and it made more sense for the fire engine to take her.'

Ms Khalid's brand new BMW One Series car was completely destroyed in Wednesday night's accident

Bob Parkinson, Unite branch secretary for North West Ambulance Service, said: 'We are very concerned to to hear about this incident and are demanding urgent answers as we have now reached a position which is unacceptable.

'We and the people of Lancashire need a thorough explanation as to what has  happened and reassurances that it will not occur again.

'This has happened at a time when we are fighting cuts to front-line services across Lancashire.'
