Samir Nasri put his World Cup disappointment behind him as he was put through his paces at Manchester City's pre-season training camp on Tuesday.

The midfielder missed out on a place in the France squad for the finals in Brazil, but looked champing at the bit to get going again during City's trip to Scotland.

Jesus Navas and Aleksandar Kolarov were among the other first-team players involved in the session at St Andrews as City prepare for Friday's friendly with Hearts.

Nasri, who has scored 22 goals in 129 appearances since his switch from Arsenal in 2011, recently penned a new five-year deal at the club.

‘It took me time to adjust to living in Manchester,’ said Nasri.

‘But last year everything was great. I enjoyed my football and I feel very much at home.

‘I understand that maybe in my second year I wasn’t great. City pay me a lot of money and the expectations are high.

'It’s normal that the fans show you their disappointment.’
