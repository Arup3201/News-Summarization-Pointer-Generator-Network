Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli may have missed Saturday's win over Aston Villa through illness, but the maverick Italian battled back to meet up with friends on Sunday night.

Balotelli headed to Manchester's San Carlo restaurant in the city centre, posing for a photo at the table which he later posted to Instagram... complete with a glass of coke in front of him.

After a poor start to life on Merseyside, the 24-year-old this week stated his intentions of proving his worth at Anfield, rubbishing speculation that he is heading for the exit door.

'He does want to stay,' manager Brendan Rodgers told the media. 'I think that is the case with him.

'He does care about doing well for Liverpool and wants to do well, but it just hasn't gone as he would have wanted.

'He's a good guy. He's not scored the goals he would have wanted, but we are determined to help him find a solution.'

Balotelli, dressed in black, smiled for photographers as he arrived at the restaurant popular with the area's footballers.

On the pitch, he has made 18 appearances for the Reds this season; 12 of which in the Premier League.

With Liverpool unbeaten in the league since December 14, things are looking up at Anfield, and Balotelli will hope that he can play a major role in a successful second half to the season.
