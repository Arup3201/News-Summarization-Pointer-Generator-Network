Alastair Cook, whose captaincy during England’s surrender of the Ashes has attracted considerable criticism, has had a lot on his mind on and off the pitch.

As well as England facing a series whitewash in Sydney, Cook is also expecting his first child with wife Alice and trying to buy a house, both of which can be stressful distractions.

While in Australia, Cook is understood to have been negotiating to buy a farm for around £1.2million.

Feeling the strain: Alastair Cook has had a stressful Ashes tour both on and off the field

The residential 52-acre farm with extensive equestrian facilities, including 10 stables, is situated near Alice’s family farm in Bedfordshire, where Cook loves to spend time helping with the lambing and having a beer with the locals to escape from the pressures of Test cricket.

There is planning permission in place for Cook to knock down the farm buildings, allowing for the construction of a country mansion with panoramic views over open rolling countryside.

Jonny Bairstow being given a second match as wicketkeeper was confirmed by captain Alastair Cook the day before the Test. Yet Australia skipper Michael Clarke, who declined to list the England side in advance as he did earlier in the series, did keep up the mind games by suggesting, at two pre-Test press conferences, that he believes axed wicketkeeper Matt Prior was especially missed by England in Melbourne and should have been back in the side for Sydney.

Colin Graves, Yorkshire chairman and deputy chairman of the ECB, and his family have more reason than most on the England tour in Australia for wanting to put 2013 behind them.

Three masked men, armed with a sledge-hammer, sword and handgun, smashed their way into the supermarket tycoon’s country home and stole £220,000 worth of jewellery.

Graves, who founded the Costcutter chain, was away on Yorkshire’s pre-season tour of Barbados last March when the raid took place. His wife Sharon was forced at gunpoint to lie on the landing while the gang opened the safe.

She was described as ‘a woman of commendable steel’ at Maidstone Crown Court where the four robbers, including a getaway driver, were recently given jail sentences of between four and 10 years.

Graves, in Sydney with his wife and daughter Francesca, who was also threatened during the armed robbery, said: ‘We were always coming to Australia as we did for the series three years ago. But it’s a chance to let us move on from a difficult time.’

Relationships between the two warring Ashes teams at Australian prime minister Tony Abbott’s reception improved to the extent that a wife of one of the England Cricket Board directors even queued up to have her picture taken with Aussie destroyer-in-chief Mitchell Johnson. However, the ECB remain furious with the way their counterparts Cricket Australia continue to use social media in an aggressive manner — and the subject will be raised after the fifth Test.

Piers’ charm offensive

Piers Morgan, who hijacked attention from the Ashes with his ludicrous MCG nets encounter with Brett Lee that resulted in a broken rib, continues on his self-publicity cricket tour Down Under by tweeting about his first meeting with the equally obnoxious Ian Chappell: “Hi, Mr Chappell, I’m Piers Morgan”, I said. “Nah mate, you’re a d*******,' he replied.’ But when it comes to d*******s, Chappell wins by a short head.

Sky Sports, who want former England captains to dominate their TV cricket commentary booth, already have a ready-made successor to current lead presenter David Gower on their team in Ian Ward, who will host the T20 internationals. Ward has managed to remain liked by the players while still asking them searching questions. However, Ward has 112 fewer England caps than Gower, which will likely count against him when the presenter role becomes available.
