Boat passengers caught a glimpse of a rare shark as it was spotted jumping out of the sea in 'shark infested waters' off the Welsh coast.

Swimmers and holidaymakers last week rushed for the shore after a blue shark ventured into the shallows on a beach in Wales.

Now a thresher shark has been caught on camera in the same stretch of water off the coast of  Ceredigion, mid-wales.

An unlikely sight: Boat passengers rushed to catch a glimpse of the 'threatened' species

The giant predator, usually seen in Asia and 
North America, shocked boat passengers when it suddenly hurled itself 
out of the water in front of the research vessel Sulaire.

As well as members of the public being on board the boat, researchers from the Cardigan Bay Marine Wildlife Centre were also conducting an-all day survey.

The sighting of the Thresher Shark caused much excitement.

Sarah Perry, the marine centre's science officer,
who was on board, said sightings of the sharks had been increasing in 
recent years in UK waters.

'Thresher sharks are normally found 
in deep waters but can follow their prey closer to the shore so maybe 
that’s what this one was doing,' she said.

'Perhaps either it or its prey were attracted by increasing sea temperatures.

'You can recognise thresher sharks by
their long tails - which they use to herd their prey into tight groups 
before feeding on them.

'They’re protected as a threatened species - they’re far more at risk from us.'

Days before the sighting, red flags were raised on the beach at New Quay, Ceredigion, as a baby blue shark swam between moored boats behind the breakwater.

The baby blue shark sparked panic when it was spotted by RNLI lifeguards heading for the shore.

The
creature came within yards of the beach and holidaymakers watched in 
wonder as it swam past their feet in water less than a metre deep.

The
incident, which happened at about 5.30pm last Tuesday, was caught on 
camera by 16-year-old, Jasmine Jones, who was on her boat as the curious creature 
investigated the shallows, the BBC reported.

Holidaymakers were advised not to swim in the water after the shark sighting. However, the beach re-opened on Wednesday.

While
the RNLI said it was very unusual to see a blue shark so close to the 
shoreline, the species are frequently spotted in waters of the coast of 
Wales, Ireland and Cornwall.

Miss Perry added: 'It’s actually not unusual to see a blue shark in British waters but they don’t usually come so close to shore. This one was very small and perhaps it was ill.'

Thresher sharks are not known as man-eaters, and tend to feed on schools of fish in shallow waters.

They use their long scythe like tails, which can make up around half of their total length, to stun prey before they tear at their flesh.

Earlier this month fearless angler Malcolm Roberts, 49, was fishing with a group of pals off the coast of Cornwall when he felt a 350lb thresher shark - which could decapitate a human using just its tail - tugging in his line.

It took him an hour and a half to haul in a 13ft shark out the water.

Mr Roberts and his five-strong crew wrestled with the giant predator before he finally pulled it into his boat.

The giant catch, landed around 20 miles off the coast of Looe, Cornwall, was one of the biggest ever caught in British waters.

In July a 20ft long thresher shark was caught by the trawler The John Boy, in Falmouth, Cornwall, which was fishing for mackerel in the English Channel.

The 550lb beast was bought by Ashton's Fishmongers in Cardiff market for a hefty price of £3,000.

Thresher sharks tend to feed on schools of fish in shallow waters. Their name comes from the sharks' unusually long tail, which can be as long as the shark itself.

They use their long scythe like tails, which can make up around half of their total length, to stun prey before they tear at their flesh.

An adult beast can grow up to 20ft long. The average weight for a thresher shark is roughly 250lbs but some can weigh as much as 1000lbs.

Its body is built almost like a torpedo-shape. There are three species of this shark, a pelagic thresher, a bigeye thresher and a common thresher.

The common thresher shark has a small body and broad head with relatively small sets of teeth.

Thresher Sharks love open and deep waters but are not generally not found deeper than 1,640ft.

They are usually seen in Asia and 
North America, but their exact habitat remains largely a mystery.
