A Townsville grandmother had been living in fear of some family members before she was brutally murdered in her home.

Ruth Dodd, 71, was stabbed to death at her house in Heatley, a suburb of Townsville, on Friday.

The well-liked community volunteer had been warned by relatives to leave her home once and for all after threats and harassment from other family members. On Saturday police questioned a woman and a man over the murder.

‘(The woman being questioned) was a high drug user. She was always after money,’ one of Ms Dodd's relatives told The Sunday Mail.

Ruth Dodd was brutally stabbed to death in her home at Heatley, a suburb of Townsville. She had allegedly been 'threatened' by relatives in the past 

 ‘(Ms Dodd) kept telling her ‘no more, no more’.

‘I know they always chased her for money. She has been threatened time and time again.

‘We’ve been trying to talk her into packing up and leaving for quite some time. We also spoke to her about taking out restraining orders.’

It was also alleged by the relative that Ms Dodd had been under pressure from someone who wanted her home.

A focus of the police investigation was her Astra hatchback car found at Aitkenvale.

A heated argument was heard at Ms Dodd's house by neighbours before the murder, with one local resident knocking on her door, but nobody answered. Police were called and made the grim discovery.

In 2010 she appeared in the Townsville Bulletin newspaper concerning a story about her house being broken into on eight separate times. 

A relative alleged that Ms Dodd knew who was breaking in, but although she took security measures to stop people from breaking in, it made no difference.

‘She said to me one day she didn’t think the police were taking her seriously,’ the relative told the told The Sunday Mail. 

The brutal murder shocked local residents as Ms Dodd, a mother of five, had lived in Townsville since the 1970s

‘I said ‘if you don’t do anything you’re going to wake up and find yourself dead one day’. 

‘They smashed her window, her kitchen bench. They even entered the house through the back through the toilet window.

‘They smashed the front door down. I saw all that when I was up there one day. It was always getting broken into.’  

The brutal murder shocked local residents as Ms Dodd, a mother of five, had lived in Townsville since the 1970s and was a volunteer for the Royal Flying Doctor Service for whom she had won many awards and accolades.
