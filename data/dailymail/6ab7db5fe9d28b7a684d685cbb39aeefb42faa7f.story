It's been almost 20 years since Duncan Ferguson celebrated Everton's FA Cup victory against Manchester United by parading the trophy around Wembley while wearing a blue nose.

But the big Scot, who is now a member of Roberto Martinez's coaching staff, has been pictured wearing a similar facial decoration as the club prepare for a different type of celebration.

Sunday's Premier League clash with Leicester City has been designated as the first ever Blue Nose Day, designed to recognise the 27th birthday of the club's charitable arm Everton in the Community.

Fans will be able to get the Ferguson look by buying their own blue nose and wearing it during Sunday's clash against the Foxes, a match which will raise money for the vital work carried out by the club on Merseyside.

First-team stars including John Stones, Steven Naismith and Muhamed Besic also wore their own blue noses in a fun photoshoot as Martinez's men prepare for a busy week of action.

The Toffees travel to Switzerland to face Young Boys in the last 32 of the Europa League on Thursday before returning to Liverpool to take on Nigel Pearson's struggling side.

Fans who purchase their own blue nose (for a suggested donation of £2) will be in with a chance of winning prizes if they are pictured wearing it at Goodison Park.

Supporters can also show their support for Everton in the Community by posting blue nose selfies to Twitter and Instagram using the hashtag #eitc27.
