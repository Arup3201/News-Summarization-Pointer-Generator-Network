Formula One drivers united today to send a message of support to their injured colleague Jules Bianchi, who is fighting for his life following an accident at the Japanese Grand Prix one week ago.

The 21 drivers gathered together shortly before the start of the inaugural Russian Grand Prix on the grid and were joined by Formula One chief Bernie Ecclestone and international federation president Jean Todt.

They stood behind the words 'Jules, we are all supporting you' inscribed into the grid.

Earlier, the entire Ferrari team sent a message of encouragement to Bianchi.

The two Ferrari drivers, Fernando Alonso and Kimi Raikkonen, flanked team chief Alberto Mattiacci behind a sign reading 'Forza Jules' (Go Jules).

Bianchi suffered a severe head injury when his Marussia car skidded off the wet course at Suzuka and ploughed into a tractor recovering another car that crashed out at the same spot one lap earlier. His condition is critical.

Bianchi's teammate Max Chilton, who was forced to retire from the race in Sochi, paid tribute to his injured comrade. 

'It's been a very, very difficult week for the team and the F1 family,' said Chilton.

'On the grid it wasn't easy and I could see the drivers were struggling a bit. Hopefully they can put on a good show for Jules today. It's just a shame I couldn't get the job done.'

And Hamilton dedicated his race win to Bianchi.

'All week there's been just one person on my mind, and that's Jules,' he said.said.

'There has been excitement and happiness for the team, but, without a doubt, every time I've got in the car this week, coming here, being here, I've been thinking about him and his family and keeping him in my prayers every day.

'Whether it means anything, or whether it does anything, it would be great to dedicate this to Jules and his family.

'It will make a very small difference to them, for sure, but every bit of positive energy hopefully will help.

'I need all you guys (the media), and all us teams to send him our positive vibes because positive energy is actually real.'
