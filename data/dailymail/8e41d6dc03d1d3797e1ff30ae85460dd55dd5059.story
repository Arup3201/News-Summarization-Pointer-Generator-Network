Christmas has been cancelled on the majority of the UK’s rail network as services wound down last night for up to 60 hours of train-free yuletide timetables.

As millions of families made their festive getaway, train services started to run down in advance of a complete shut-down of the rail network today, with services axed in most areas on Boxing Day, and a late start to a limited Bank Holiday  service on Tuesday.

East Coast, Virgin West Coast, First Great Western, Northern Rail, Cross Country, South West trains and  South Eastern are among those writing off the majority of Christmas with blank departure and arrivals boards.

Walk-out: London Underground workers will strike on Boxing Day

And many of those trains which do eventually run between Christmas and New Year will be subject to delays, diversions and cancellations caused by engineering works and the dreaded  bus replacement services.

In Scotland, railway signal workers started a 72-hour strike yesterday in a dispute over career progression.

Just to add to Britons' woes, Tube services will be hit by striking Underground workers who want extra pay to work on Boxing Day.

It means millions of families will have to resort to their cars to visit friends and relatives over the festive period – or simply stay at home.

Passenger groups and rail experts in Britain  want to know why British rail passengers have to put up with such a shoddy service – despite pledges by the Conservatives in opposition that they would end the Christmas shut-downs.

It comes as passengers face soaring New Year fares averaging 5.9 per cent but potentially as high as 11 per cent.

Philip Haigh, business editor of the respected Rail magazine said: ’It’s almost a three-day shut-down.

'Local services should be running – on Boxing day at the very least. It used to happen 30 or 40 years ago. But then the whole country used to work a lot harder over the Christmas period.

‘There’s clearly a demand for travel on Boxing Day – you only have to look at the queues in the busy shops and shopping centres. Some of them, like the Metro Centre in Gateshead and Meadowhall in Sheffield, even have their own stations.’

Up to 18 million cars took to the roads yesterday with a ‘delayed rush hour’ as people set off to spend Christmas with family or to do last-minute Christmas shopping.

But there was chaos in the capital as one of the main arterial routes into London was blocked because of a ‘serious structural defect’ at the Hammersmith Flyover on the A4 discovered on Thursday night.

Getaway traffic was heavy on major routes, including the M1 in Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire, the M4 between London and Newbury in Berkshire, the M25 around London, and the M4 and M5 in the West Country.

The Highways Agency said 19 sets of roadworks and lane restrictions had been removed to ease congestion, and will not be put back until the new year.

However 26 roadworks remain in place including on the M1 near Luton, the M25, and the A1 near Thirsk.
