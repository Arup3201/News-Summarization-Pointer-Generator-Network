Trayvon Martin was walking home from 7-Eleven with Skittles and an Arizona iced tea on February 26, 2012 when he was confronted by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman and shot and killed.

He was by many accounts an average American 17-year-old going about his business. In the 17 months since he death, the unarmed teenager has become the country's newest race icon.

And supporters last night compared him to Emmet Till,the 14-year-old boy who was tortured and brutally murdered by two white men in Mississippi in 1955.

Protestors have turned Trayvon Martin into a Civil Rights icon and argued that his death - and the way it was handled by law enforcement - was heavily influenced by him being a black teenage

The
acquittal of Zimmerman - a half white, half-Hispanic man charged with 
murdering a black teenager - has helped create a racial tinder box. 
Trayvon's supporters say he was targeted because he was a black teenager
walking through a gated community.

The attorney representing Trayvon's 
attorney poured gasoline on the embers on Saturday night when he 
compared Trayvon to Emmett Till and Medgar Evers.

Both Till and Evers were two young African-Americans who were brutally murdered by racist whites in the Jim Crow South and whose killers were allowed to walk free by a corrupt, prejudiced justice system. The injustice brought international attention to plight of blacks in the South and helped spark the Civil Rights movement.

'Trayvon Martin will forever remain in the annals of history next to Medgar Evers and Emmett Till as symbols for the fight for equal justice for all,' Benjamin Crump declared at a press conference after Zimmerman's acquittal.

Crump called for calm among supporters of Trayvon's family, but added that in 50 years, he believes the verdict by the all-female jury - all but one of whose members was white - would be remembered as an injustice similar to the acquittal of the men accused of killing Till.

Till was a 14-year-old black boy by from Chicago was a said to have whistled at a white female shopkeeper when he was in Mississippi visiting family in 1955.

Roy Bryant, the woman's husband, and his half-brother J.W. Milam abducted Till, tortured him, gouged out his eye and this shot him dead before dumping his body in a river.

An all-white jury acquitted both men despite witnesses who put them at the scene of the murder. They brazenly later admitted to the killing in a magazine article. Milam died of cancer in 1980. Bryant succumbed to the same illness in 1994, having never served  prison time for the horrific killing.

Thousands of protestors took to the streets in the spring of 2012 to demand that Zimmerman be arrested and tried for murder - which he ultimately was

Zimmerman's lawyers said he must remain in hiding because of the hundreds, perhaps thousands, of death threats he has received since he shot dead Trayvon

Evers was a 37-year-old civil rights campaigner who was shot in the back by  Byron De La Beckwith, a white supremacist, outside his home in Mississippi in 1963. An all-white jury failed to reach a verdict in the case against De La Beckwith. He went free or three decades until he was re-tried and convicted in 1994.

In August 1955, 14-year-old Emmett Till was visiting his family in Mississippi from his home in Florida.

At some point, he met 21-year-old Carolyn Bryant, the white owner of a grocery store and struck up a conversation.

Accounts of what happened in the store vary. Some say young Till wolf-whistled at Bryant. Others say he grabbed her around the waist and asked her for a date. Still others say the conversation was completely innocuous.

Either way, Carolyn was alarmed and told her husband, who vowed revenge on the boy who had 'disrespected' his young wife.

Several nights later, Roy Bryant and his half-brother J.W. Milam abducted Till and took him to a family shed.

Bryant later recounted in a magazine interview that it had been his intention to beat Till severely and 'scare' him. Instead, Till insisted he had had sexual encounters with white women 

That was too much for Bryant, a white southerner. He recounted to a magazine reporter years later that he told Till: ''Chicago boy. I'm tired of 'em sending your kind down here to stir up trouble. God**** you, I'm going to make an example of you - just so everybody can know how me and my folks stand.'

They tortured Till, gouged out one of his eyes and then shot him dead execution-style.

They then tied a large metal fan to his neck with barbed wire and threw his body in a river. It was recovered days later.

Till's murder caused international headlines - made all the more sensational by his mother's decision to keep the casket open at his funeral.

Bryant and Milam were put on trial - but both were acquitted by juries comprised of only white men. Their lawyers argued that the body found was not Till's and that Till was never killed.

They brazenly later admitted to the killing in a magazine article. Milam died of cancer in 1980. Bryant succumbed to the same illness in 1994, having never served  prison time for the horrific killing.

Both cases proved pivotal in the U.S. Civil Rights movements, as they seemed to prove to the country - and to the world - that the Rule of Law didn't apply to blacks in the South.

Crump implied on Saturday that Zimmerman's acquittal meant the same thing about the justice system in Florida.

He was not alone. Dozens of supporters took Twitter to make the comparison, as well.

'Not guilty. No surprise. Another line in the indictment of America. From Emmett Till to Trayvon Martin, never forget,' tweeted Greg Carr, the chairman of the Howard University Department of Afro-American studies.

'Emmett Till whistled and Trayvon Martin had a hoodie on. They were both killed by white men. Different centuries same problem,' twitter user iBennyTruise wrote.

'Emmett Till all over again.Can’t believe this is where we are as a country. Florida has dragged America back 60 years,' another user said.

Until Trayvon's fatal confrontation with Zimmerman, he seemed an unlikely symbol of the civil rights movement.

Trayvon was a high school junior living with his mother Sabrina Fulton in Miami Gardens, Florida.

He was suspended from school in February for possession of marijuana. Social media posts unearthed after his death reportedly show the teenager smoking the drugs.

One picture that surfaced shows him with a semi-automatic handgun as well.

Despite attempts by some supporters of Zimmerman to portray Trayvon as a juvenile delinquent, his family maintains he was a 'sweet and gentle' boy.

During his suspension from school, he went to Sanford, Florida, to stay with his father and his father's girlfriend - who was renting a townhouse in the Retreat at Twin Lakes - a gates community where Zimmerman also lived.

It was there - while Trayvon was walking home from a trip to 7-Eleven to buy an Arizona iced tea and Skittles - that he was spotted by Zimmerman.

By all accounts, he was minding his own business and just returning home from the store.

Supporters of Trayvon's family say the teen was targeted because he was black and had the hood on his black hooded sweatshirt up.

Defense lawyers said that the 29-year-old Zimmerman - who was a neighborhood watch volunteer patrolling the community - was on sharp lookout after numerous break-ins in the area.

He called the police and then tried to track down Trayvon.

What's next remains in dispute. Zimmerman says the 6-foot-2 Trayvon turned and assaulted him and smashed his head against the sidewalk.That's when Zimmerman opened fire.

Prosecutors argued that Zimmerman was the aggressor.

Ultimately, the jury sided with Zimmerman and acquitted him on all charges.

That has not stopped tens of thousands of protesting the decision - both online and in protests across the country.

Even defense lawyers concede that there are many who will not accept the 'not guilty' verdict.
