Phil Neville has swapped allegiances, from red to green, as the former Manchester United player has become a vegetarian.

The 37-year-old has been on a meat-free diet for a few weeks after his wife Julie persuaded him to do so and it is a decision Neville hasn't regretted.

New man: Phil Neville (right) has become a vegetarian after being persuaded by his wife

Food for thought: Neville (centre) was told on Sunday that his Manchester United coaching career was over

In an interview for animal rights charity PETA he said: 'I always used to think as a footballer, as a sportsman, that it was so important for me to eat meat, to have that in my diet.

'I thought if I became a vegetarian that would take away a lot of the nutrients that I would require to be a professional footballer and an athlete. I was really ignorant.'

Neville is the latest professional sportsperson to opt for a vegetarian diet which includes tennis star Serena Williams, former athlete Carl Lewis and boxer David Haye.

The former England international rejoined United as a coach at the start of the season as part of former Red Devils' boss David Moyes' backroom staff.

However, after a tumultuous campaign at the club he was informed by executive vice chairman Ed Woodward that, along with goalkeeping coach Chris Woods, he had no future at the club following United's 1-1 draw at Southampton on Sunday.

Neville's older brother Gary believed the deposed Premier League champions have panicked in the transfer market and the wants the club to only spend their money on quality signings.

Speaking on Sky Sports, Neville hopes expected United boss Louis van Gaal fine tunes the squad where necessary in order for the the club to compete for honours again.

‘Luis Van Gaal is potentially going to get the job and he will have to asses it. It won’t happen overnight, but they have a great chance to get back into the Champions League, especially as they have no European football next season,' he said.

‘If he decides he wants eight players, that doesn’t mean he should go and buy eight players. Signing three or four real top quality – and improving next season, bedding them in and then going again with two or three more the year after is the organic approach I would expect Manchester United to have.

‘However, I didn’t expect Manchester United to sack a manager after ten months, so what’s going to happen in the next few months, who knows?'

Panic buy: Maroaune Fellaini joined Manchester United for £27.5million on deadline day in August

Under sacked Manchester United boss David Moyes, the club struggled to acquire their much publicised summer targets - something Neville doesn't want a repeat of.

‘United have panicked into signing players who were not the top choices,' he added.

‘It was quite public last summer who United’s targets were – it was either Bale or Ronaldo, it was Fabregas, it was Baines and it was Fellaini. They were the targets, it was publicised – and I don’t know why because Manchester United have always kept their transfer dealings really quiet. I’m not quite sure how all of a sudden everyone knows who they are signing.

‘But if they can’t get No 1, No 2, three or four - I’m not in a rush. As a Manchester United fan, I’d rather seen James Wilson come through than some fourth choice striker who isn’t at the top of the list.

‘I don’t want signing number eight, nine or 10, because they can’t get No 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 - I have no interest in that.

‘I’m a supporter too, I want signings, as fan. I (only) want quality players.’
