The writers behind Game Change are working on a sequel about Mitt Romney’s failed bid for the White House - with a film already in the works.

Authors Mark Halperin and John Heilemann are writing Double Down: Game Change 2012 to dissect what went wrong with the Republicans during the election.

It will be published in Fall next year with the film coming some time after.

The book and film will likely make the Romney camp squirm as Game Change made the Republican party’s 2008 campaign appear riven with conflict.

It was also harsh on former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin and made it seem like she was completely unqualified for the role.

Her equivalent in this year’s election was Paul Ryan who some have claimed hijacked Romney’s campaign with his economic ideology.

Game Change 2012 will also lead to speculation about who will play the main characters.

The original had an impressive cast including Julianne Moore who won an Emmy for Best Actress in a Mini-Series or Movie for the lead role.

Ed Harris played Republican Presidential candidate John McCain whilst Woody Harrelson was Republican strategist Steve Schmidt.

It is unknown yet who will play Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan in the forthcoming Double Down movie

In total Game Change won four Emmys including the coveted Outstanding Mini-Series or Movie.

It was directed by a Jay Roach-directed and written by Danny Strong and according to the Hollywood Reporter, which first reported the news, both are likely to return for the sequel.

Whilst the original Game Change was a hit for HBO, Republicans were outraged by it.

Palin was deeply unimpressed and sent out her own video response to fans titled ‘Game Change We Can Believe In’, a pun on Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign slogan.

In a note she said that the film ‘lapsed into a tired routine of manipulating facts and omitting key parts of Governor Palin’s story in order to push a biased agenda and drive ratings.’

Palin later attacked it for being ‘based on a false narrative’ and said that she didn’t care about being ‘in the good graces of Hollywood's Team Obama.’

Both John McCain and Sarah Palin were critical of the original Game Change which documented their 2008 bid for the White House

In an interview McCain has said that even though he was portrayed sympathetically, he did not like how his character used so many swear words and that Palin was made to look bad.

He said: ‘I don't understand, even in the tough world of politics, why there continues to be such an assault on a good and decent person.

‘I admired and respect her. I'm proud of our campaign....I thought she was the most qualified person.’

Penguin publisher Ann Godoff said in a statement: ‘John Heilemann and Mark Halperin reinvented the campaign narrative with Game Change.

‘Their new book Double Down will, of course, break news; but more importantly, it will create the lasting story of the 2012 race for the presidency."
