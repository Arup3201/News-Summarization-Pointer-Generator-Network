Billed as Brazil's first player-powered football pitch, a field in a Rio de Janeiro slum has been opened that harnesses the kinetic energy of players' movements to provide night-time illumination.

Football legend Pele was on hand for the event in the Morro da Mineira slum, which saw a local youth team put the system to the test.

Under the project, sponsored by Royal Dutch Shell, about 200 energy-capturing tiles developed by British startup Pavegen were installed the width and breadth of the field and covered by a layer of AstroTurf.

Working in conjunction with solar panels also installed around the field, the player-powered tiles feed electricity to a system of floodlights overhead.

A safety gadget has been devised for athletes to prevent serious head injuries occurring during sports.

The Jolt Sensor device monitors the movement of players, keeping track of any dangerous impacts.

Any potential threat causes the clip - worn on the player's head - to vibrate and send a wireless message to referees, as well as parents and coaches on the sidelines.

The gadget was created by CEO Ben Harvatine from St. Louis, Missouri after he suffered from concussion himself. 

It is hoped the Jolt Sensor will help reduce serious concussion by encouraging sportsmen to stop play at the time of injury.

The company are aiming to start shipping the product in April 2015, with a Kickstarter campaign currently taking place to raise £36,000 ($60,000). 

While the head of Pavegen, engineer Laurence Kemball-Cook, did not reveal the exact science behind the tiles, his father and the company's chairman, Richard Kemball-Cook, said they use a system of cogs. 

When stepped on, the cogs spin like tops and act like generators, he said.

Each tile now costs about £310 ($500), but the price is falling as the 35-employee company refines its manufacturing process, Mr Kemball-Cook said.

Pavegen has installed similar tiles in train stations in Europe, shopping centres in Australia and Terminal 3 of London's Heathrow Airport, Laurence Kemball-Cook said, but the football field is a first.

'We've effectively turned this community into a real-life science experiment,' he said. 

'I believe this technology can be one of the future ways we illuminate our cities.'

Similar tiles have been employed in airports, shopping centres and more but this is the first time they have been used on a football field

The new pitch was launched by Brazilian football legend Pele. The technology could also apparently be used to power future cities

Pele got emotional over the project, tearing up as he said he hoped the new field would help spark local kids' interest not only in football but in science.

'My father named me Edson after Thomas Edison,' said the longtime star striker, whose birth name is Edson Arantes do Nascimento.

He said he hopes the next generation of Brazilians will help bring the country as much success in science as it has had in football.

'I'm sure that soon the number one scientists in the world are going to be Brazilians,' Pele said.
