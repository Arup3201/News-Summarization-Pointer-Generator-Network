Toronado is primed to give trainer Richard Hannon a Royal Ascot winner with his first ever runner when lining up in Tuesday's curtain-raising Queen Anne Stakes.

It is a massive day for the man who took over running the family stable from five-time champion trainer father, Richard snr, at the start of the year.

He also saddles his 2,000 Guineas winner Night of Thunder against Kingman, the colt which chased him home at Newmarket, in the feature St James's Palace Stakes.

Primed: Toronado has attracted the most confident update from Richard Hannon

That promises to be a re-match to settle the arguments still hanging in the air.

But it is Toronado, the mount of Richard Hughes, who has attracted the most confident update from Hannon.

The colt, owned by Sheik Joaan Al Thani, has not run since trailing in last of six in York's 10-furlong Juddmonte International Stakes in August.

The son of High Chaparral had previously proved himself one of the best milers of his generation with victory in the Sussex Stakes, a success which followed an agonising short-head defeat by Dawn Approach in last year's St James's Palace Stakes.

Back at that trip, he is a hot favourite for the first of three group one races on the strongest day's programme at this glittering five-day Festival.

Hannon said: 'Toronado is in great nick. He is the most awesome horse we have ever trained. Yes, he will improve for the race but I would be disappointed if he didn't win.

'He is awesome when he works and that has not changed from last year.

'He had a break and was not right after the Juddmonte but he is back right now. He is near unbeatable at a mile when he is right and the guys who ride him out each day tell me he is in fantastic form.'

Big day: Richard Hannon is looking for his first Royal Ascot winner after taking over the family stable

Eighty winner on board by Royal  Ascot is a start Hannon would have settled for. 

The big one  was Night Of Thunder's Guineas win, a Classic victory which sent out a message that it was business as usual at the biggest stable in the land despite a change of chief executive.

The 2,000 Guineas , which also featured Derby winner and runner-up, Australia and Kingston Hill, in third and eighth respectively, is looking a quality renewal but its tactical nature â€“ the field split into two separate groups â€“ left some feeling Kingman was an unlucky loser.

That view did not diminish when Kingman dashed home five lengths clear in the Irish 2,000 Guineas under jockey James Doyle.

Added spice to the re-match is provided by the fact that Hannon and Gosden are battling it out for the trainer's title race, with Hannon only Â£70,000 ahead.

But Hannon, who also saddles Guineas seventh Toormore in the race, is unfazed by those who think Night Of Thunder got lucky on the Rowley Mile.

He said: 'I see no reason for a reversal (in the form). We finished from behind Kingman at Newmarket and our horse also swerved. They should be  6-4 joint favourites.

'Kingman was impressive in the Irish Guineas but we are very happy with our fella.' 

If the battles on the track promise to be as intense, there is a more than a fascinating sideshow off it concerning broadcaster Channel 4 and its viewing figures.

Having taken a big plunge on Derby day, there is nervousness around the industry that there will be a similar trend at the sport's showcase Flat meeting.

C4 have called up the celebrity cavalry to add some pizzazz to their output in the form of fashion guru Gok Wan and the weighing room's best known face Frankie Dettori, who will be a pundit between riding commitments, something his boss Sheik Joaan surprisingly appears happy to happen.

But halting the fall is a challenge you would not back International Rescue to pull off.

Moving away from the BBC to saddle up with a minority channel has inevitably meant a lower profile for the sport.

It will probably need another win for the Queen's Estimate in Thursday's Gold Cup to place racing at the centre of the sporting agenda in such a packed wider schedule dominated by the World Cup.   

No one should be holding their breath waiting for a upturn in viewers although, sources insist, talk of imminent crisis talks with the broadcaster a year and a half into a four-year rights deal is premature.
