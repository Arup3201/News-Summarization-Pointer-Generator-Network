'Smart scales' could be the key to the rehabilitation of patients suffering from eating disorders.

A recent study has found that 75 per cent of patients treated using the Mandometer method were free of symptoms one year later.

The Swedish method sees patients re-learn normal eating behaviour by using a feedback device attached to a scale.

Success story: The Mandometer weighs the food on the plate and tells the patient at what speed they should be eating. It also asks them to register how full they feel, re-training normal eating behaviour

The Mandometer food scale is attached to a computer which tells the patient how much they should be eating and how full they should feel to achieve normal eating habits.

The patient places their plate on the scale and puts their allocated food on the plate. As the patient eats, the computer registers the speed they eat and the patient puts in how full he or she is feeling throughout the meal.

If the patient is eating too slowly, the computer registers this and tells them to speed up, aiming to finish the meal in 15 minutes.

The registered feeling of fullness is shown as a second curve, with the aim of following a 'normal' pattern.

The goal is to re-train the brain, and to see the patient return to a normal eating behaviour within three to four months.

Good work: A recent study has found that 75 per cent of patients treated using the Mandometer method were in remission 12.5 months later

Once patients normalise eating patterns they no longer feel rewarded for eating less or purging, targeting the psychiatric symptoms behind the eating disorder.

The new study, published in the American Psychological Associations' journal Behavioral Neuroscience, found that within 12.5 months on average, 75 per cent of all patients were free of symptoms and only ten per cent of patients relapsed over five years.

‘This follow-up on 18 years of work show that treatment on a neurobiological base is effective’, says Per Södersten, professor of behavioural neuroendocrinology at Karolinska Institutet's Department of Neurobiology.

The device can also be used in reverse, teaching people who are overweight not to eat too fast.

Just three years ago, the NHS bought several Mandometers to use to tell people to eat slower and to remind them to think if they are feeling full.

The Mandometer is a scale for your plate, connected to a computer

@highlight

It registers how much food is on the plate and how fast you eat

It also asks you to register how full you feel, to encourage normal satiation
