Nutcrackers are normally only a Christmas accessory. But one couple have amassed more than 200 of them after they began collecting them eight years ago.

Carol Northover, 60, and husband Robert, 68, have three China cabinets full of them. Classroom assistant Carol, from Chilthorne, Domer, near Yeovil, Somerset, said: 'We bore our friends rigid. We see their eyes glazing over. Our daughters think we are barmy.'

Their collection includes nutcrackers dating back to the 18th century and are made from wood, metal, silver and plastic.

The most expensive nutcracker they bought was £40, and the cheapest was just 50p.  Two of the nutcrackers come in the figures of ex-PM Margaret Thatcher and US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

But for Christmas, they will not be using any of their prized collection. Instead, Carol said, 'We are going to use the one that we bought in Lidl.'

Nuts have long been a popular desert in Europe,and the earliest known use of the English term nutcracker dates back to 1481. 

In the  fifteenth century, carpenters began carving decorative nutcrackers decorative nutcrackers in rural Germany. The carvings usually depicted a soldier or knight with a large mouth-piece opened by a lever - you could crack the nut by inserting it into the mouth.

Nowadays, these types of nutcrackers are mostly used for decoration at Christmas.
