John O'Neill's bad temper and foul mouthed rants have seen him locked up more than 50 times

A man dubbed 'Britain's rudest pensioner' has been jailed once again after drinking whisky, smoking cannabis and abusing passers-by.

John O'Neill's bad temper and foul mouth has seen him locked up more than 50 times.

The 71-year-old Scotsman, who claims to be a science graduate, terrorised people with his rants over everyday life - including one tirade launched at a mother feeding her child. 

In 2009 he was issued with a five-year ASBO after causing misery in the Didsbury and Rusholme areas of Manchester.

Council officials in Manchester took action after complaints about his behaviour in a string of shops and restaurants including M&S, Café Rouge, Lidl, Tesco Express and retail outlets at Manchester Airport.

Locals complained about him swearing and shouting aggressively, urinating on a vehicle and even defecating on a lawn in front of horrified passers-by.

One member of staff at a shop transferred to another branch to avoid having to deal with him. 

Last Friday O'Neill, who has clocked up 235 offences since 1968, was hauled back to court after police tackled him over an incident at a bakery in Crumpsall, Manchester. 

A PCSO who found him slumped on a park bench was told by the OAP: 'F*** you, I will put bullets in your f*****g head. Are you bomb proof? Because I will f*****g bomb you.'

At Manchester Crown Court, O'Neill of Chorlton, Manchester admitted breaching his ASBO and was jailed for three months.

Prosecutors said he has a 'voluminous' criminal record' and was once described by a judge as a 'thorough nuisance' who was 'foul mouthed, aggressive and had no respect for authority or for Police, shop keepers and members of the public.'

Manchester City Council provided evidence of 53 incidents involving O'Neill which also included shop lifting and being in possession of cannabis and having a knife.

At the time the ASBO banned O'Neill from using abusive, insulting, offensive, threatening or intimidating language or behaviour in a public place or in any place to which the public has access. 

He was barred from urinating or defecating in a public place or in any place to which the public has access - except for designated public toilets - and taking property belonging to someone else without paying or without the consent of the owner.

He was also excluded from a large area of south Manchester, including the airport unless he has a valid ticket for travel.

But last year O'Neill shouted at a young mother at a Costa coffee shop in Chorlton, claiming her 'hoity toity' and 'snooty' attitude set him off. 

The woman was breaking a biscuit to feed her son when O'Neill turned to the two-year-old and said 'she'll break you into pieces next'. He then told the boy, 'don't take any of that bull****, you will be taking that your whole life.'

When the mother confronted him about his language, O'Neill began screaming, calling her a 'f****ing balloon' and a 's*** mum.' 

The pensioner was in such a fury that he could be heard across Chorlton precinct, leading nearby shopkeepers to step in and restrain him.

During other incidents he flew into a violent rage on a bus, and pushed over a shop worker. 

At Manchester Crown Court, O'Neill of Chorlton, Manchester admitted breaching his ASBO and was jailed for three months. Prosecutors said he has a 'voluminous' criminal record' and was once described by a judge as a 'thorough nuisance' who was 'foul mouthed, aggressive and had no respect for authority'

Last July he was given a nine-month community order, with a plea from a judge to start behaving himself. 

But on January 15, he entered a bakery in Crumpsall, Manchester, and began to abuse staff to the point they called in the police.

Among his 'monumental' list of crimes, O’Neill has been prosecuted for:

Prosecuting, Justin Hayhoe said: 'Staff at the bakery in Crumpsall saw the defendant, who was highly intoxicated and being abusive. 

'They tried to eject him and a PCSO attended and saw the defendant slumped in a seat.

'They engaged him and he was abusive towards them.

'He has a voluminous antecedent record, with a plethora of convictions for dishonesty, some violent, several involving alcohol. 

'He has received a variety of sentences including discharges, fines, community orders and custody. He has habitually and repeatedly breached ASBOs.'

In mitigation, Robert Smith said: 'The defendant accepts he had consumed whisky and cannabis and has no memory of what has happened. Perhaps his biggest mitigation is he has pleaded guilty at the first opportunity.'
