A British climber plunged more than 2,000ft to his death after slipping on ice on a mountain in New Zealand.

Robert Buckley, 31, was with three compatriots but police said they seemed too poorly equipped and inexperienced for the trek.

Mr Buckley, of Shoeburyness, Essex, had been on a round-the-world trip and moved to New Zealand a year ago. In May, he had returned home when his father died.

Brit Robert Buckley died on Saturday while climbing Mount Sefton, in New Zealand South Island's Aoraki Mount Cook National Park, pictured

His mother Jill Ray, 58, said that he
told her he had been ‘living the dream’. Mr Buckley’s companions raised
the alarm but had to wait on Mount Sefton overnight for rescue by 
helicopter because of bad weather.

Mr Buckley was wearing crampons but was still under-prepared, local police officer Dave Gaskin said.

'There was a lot of snow and ice in very steep conditions,' Mr Gaskin said.

'It appears as if the party were insufficiently equipped and inexperienced for the climb they had undertaken.'

Mr Buckley's body was recovered by a team of rescuers yesterday afternoon after attempts to do so on Saturday were unsuccessful, according to local media reports.

Mr Buckley, who was originally from Essex, lived in Christchurch, New Zealand, and was with three other climbers from Britain and Ireland when he fell after slipping on ice, police said.

The three climbers were rescued yesterday after spending the night on the mountain, it was reported. The trio were released after an examination by medical staff.

Mr Buckley and his three friends were trying to reach a hut on the mountain when he fell 2,000ft to his death

He is the second Briton to die in a fall
in the country this month after film director Caroline Johnstone, 44, 
originally from London, fell 400ft to her death on Mount Ruapehu.

Mr Buckley's death came a day after 36-year-old Duncan Raite died after slipping and falling about 200 feet from a ridge in the same national park.

The New Zealand-born man, who lived in Australia, had been dropped off by helicopter and was walking to a hut when he fell in the Tasman Glacier area.

The fall happened on Mount Sefton, New Zealand

Mr Gaskin said the deaths were a reminder that climbers needed to use extreme caution.

'I can't speak for the first death, but in this case it looks like a lack of experience,' Mr Gaskin told the Timaru Herald.

A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: 'We are aware of the death of a British man in New Zealand. We are providing consular assistance at this time.'
