Controversial Radio shock jock Kyle Sandilands could be on his way to an early death if he continues to live an unhealthy lifestyle.

The Kiis FM host’s latest antic of vomiting live on air this morning has put the spotlight on his ballooning weight with medical professionals expressing grave concern about the 43 year-old’s future.

Sandilands and his co-host Jackie O were halfway through an interview on their morning show when he announced ‘hang on, I feel really sick,’ before vomiting into a bin.

The outspoken host managed to take time between vomiting to commentate on the incident: ‘I don't know whether it is that bloody ridiculous story you have been telling.’

Producers promptly switched to advertising as Sandilands continued to vomit into the plastic bin but later on tweeted about the drama to followers and posted a video on the station’s website.

Accredited practising dietitian Julie Meek described the unnecessarily public moment as a possible cry for help.

‘If he wanted to keep that quiet he would absolutely not make any mention of that publicly maybe some of it is “I need some help”,’ she said.  ‘If he keeps going on with these habits the end result will be a heart attack or obviously early death which is fairly major.’

Sandilands has admitted in the past to eating half a loaf of bread with a milkshake every day for breakfast but his manager told the Daily Telegraph in 2012 that his client did not have diabetes and he saw a doctor regularly.

He even received an offer from the radio station's CEO to train the host with his boss tweeting:

'We’re safe to say that -  based on previous experiences with exercise - Kyle isn’t likely to take up the offer and has no interest in changing his lifestyle just now.'

It was well-reported that he attempted to train with Commando from The Biggest Loser but gave up almost as soon as he started back in April 2007.

But Sandilands is not alone with his issues to keep his weight down with one in three Australians overweight suffering the same problem - equating to an an astounding 12 million people.

Obesity is only beaten by smoking and high blood pressure as a contributor to burden of disease with Sandilands well known as a smoker but not a drinker.

Sandilands is deemed a majority with almost 65 per cent of Australians overweight or obese

The 43-year-old is at ‘absolute prime danger age’ for a heart attack or heart disease, Meek says.

The 43-year-old is at ‘absolute prime danger age’ for a heart attack, Meek says.

‘The 40 – 50 years old age group is the danger period for men,’ she said. ‘It’s a time when a lot of men carry a lot more weight than they did in their earlier years and are less active because they might have jobs that are a bit demanding and a lot of competing priorities.’

But Meek said Sandilands was far from a minority with almost 65 per cent of Australians overweight or obese.

‘Unfortunately it’s extremely common - he’s among the majority,’ she said. ‘Other people would be looking at him and thinking that he’s really overweight and not in a good place but some of those people need to look at themselves because they are in exactly the same situation.’

‘He’s in a public position where he can’t hide any of that but a lot of people are doing exactly the same thing but they are just not in the public eye - they don’t have people making comment on them.’

Like so many Australians, Sandilands needs to be educated about food by a dietitian, Meek says.

‘He also needs to find a buddy to exercise with because when you get to a particular size that in itself can be overwhelming – it’s almost like ‘it’s too hard, I can’t do it’,” she said.

‘There’s no way he could be happy about how he not just looks, but he must feel terrible as well.’
