Luis Suarez is hopeful he will be fit to face England at the World Cup after undergoing keyhole surgery on his knee.

Uruguay chiefs allege that the Liverpool striker sustained the injury on the final day of the Barclays Premier League season against Newcastle.

The 27-year-old gave his nation a scare as he was rushed to hospital for an operation.

Shock: The news of Suarez's injury came as a big surprise on Thursday morning

Although it is uncertain he will 
recover in time for Uruguay’s Group D opener against Costa Rica on June 
14 at the Estadio Castelao, Suarez is convinced he can be fit in time 
for the tournament.

‘Thank you all for the support,’ he told La Ovacion in his native Uruguay.

‘I’ll work quietly and very hard in the coming days to be 100 per cent and help my team-mates.’

The
 news will come as a relief to the South American nation, who reached 
the semi-finals at the last World Cup in South Africa four years ago.

Suarez’s mother Sandra Diaz was pleased her son’s surgery was a success.

She said: ‘The surgery is over and thank God everything went well. What Luis had wasn’t as serious as we thought.’

But Uruguay FA president Wilmar Valdez suggested if Suarez’s recovery went to plan he could return to training in just over a fortnight.

‘We know the surgery was a success and that the injury is not serious. We have to wait and see how he recovers,’ he told Uruguayan newspaper La Ovacion.

‘We had very little time to react and without knowing the extent of the injury, we didn’t want to raise the alarm to the public.

‘These
 are injuries that, considering Suarez’s fitness and if the recovery is 
good, will not take long for him to return to play.

‘We have to calculate if he will arrive for the first, second of third (group game at the World Cup).

‘We know that normally the recovery period, if all goes well, is around 15 days to return to training.

‘We all know what Luis represents to the national team and more so, considering the great form he was in.

Looking up: It was initially thought certain that Suarez would miss the World Cup

‘Considering how valuable he is to the national team, it is a big concern for us.’

Suarez, who was named the Professional
 Footballers’ Association and Football Writers’ Association player of 
the year after scoring 31 league goals, is his country’s all-time 
leading scorer with 39 in 77 appearances.

He
 picked up the injury in training and, following the meniscus surgery, 
the worst case scenario for this type of injury is 16 weeks on the 
sidelines.

Suarez’s sister 
Giovanna said her brother began feeling an uncomfortable pain during his
 last Premier League game and it returned during his first day of 
training with the Uruguayan national team on Wednesday.

Year to remember: Suarez scored an incredible 31 goals in 33 Premier League games last season

However, she believes the Liverpool star will be ready for the World Cup.

‘The problem is that these days he won’t be able to play, and will only be able to do physiotherapy,’ she said.

‘He underwent a magnetic resonance and it came out that he had to undergo surgery. It was that quick.’

On
 the injury, an Uruguay FA official said: ‘It was all unexpected. The 
latest information is that we are deciding what to do, but there are 
increased possibilities (involving surgery).

Optimistic: Suarez's family are confident he will make the World Cup

‘I can’t tell you anything more. The AUF (Uruguay Federation) will announce it officially on Thursday morning.’

Suarez was checked over by medical staff on Wednesday after picking up the knock in training just three weeks before the tournament starts in Brazil.

With the final 23-man World Cup squad needed to be ratified on June 2, it leaves Uruguay with very little wriggle room.

Any decision to include Suarez - not match fit - would still represent a sizeable risk.

Plenty to ponder: Uruguay manager Oscar Tabarez will want to give Suarez as long as possible

They won’t be encouraged to know that Fernando Torres underwent meniscus surgery prior to the 2010 World Cup in April and didn’t play his first game for seven weeks.

Should Suarez be out for longer, it would heavily impact on Liverpool’s start to the next campaign. The Reds are aware of the injury but haven’t been officially informed.

The 27-year-old arrived in Montevideo for training on Tuesday morning, feeling discomfort in a session with Oscar Tabarez’s squad on Wednesday but continuing before encountering the major problem later in the evening.
