In Aaron Rose's breathtaking photographs taken in the early 1960s on Coney island, Brooklyn’s famed beach emerges as the ever-egalitarian human melting pot simmering in the sun.

From the very beginning, the humble working class resort has been attracting sun worshipers from all walks of life and of every race, creed and color. Between 1961 and 1963, Rose traveled to Coney Island to document life on the beach in all its many facets.

His candid snapshots invite the viewer into the world of couples passionately kissing in full view of their neighbors, mothers with their nude children playing in the surf and Rubenesque goddesses reclining on the sand in all their glory.

Sea of humanity: Photographer Aaron Rose traveled to Coney Island in Brooklyn more than 50 years ago to capture sun worshipers in their natural habitat

Grand dames of Coney Island: Rose caught a glimpse of this beach-goer on the left who appears to be more interested in her hand of cards than the ocean; the Brooklyn grandmother on the right is clearly not afraid to show off her decolletage

Anatomy lesson: What Rose found most fascinating is the great variety of body types all on display on the beach

It's getting hot in here: The photographer's candid camera captured intimate moments between amorous couples letting loose in the sand

Dare to be different: Unusually tall, muscular, lanky, fat and skinny - Coney Island has attracted everyone like a great big melting pot 

Egalitarian: The beach as seen in Rose's pictures is the great equalizer welcoming the young, middle-aged and elderly alike

Supreme self-confidence: No one in Rose's series of photos appears self-conscious or concerned with body image

No one in Rose's series of photos, aptly titled In a World of Their Own, appears self-conscious or concerned with body image.

Less-than-pert
 behinds, fleshy arms, ample bosoms and rotund bellies squeezed into 
bathing suits are all proudly on display in the 50-year-old photographs.

In an interview with Museum of the City of New York
 where Rose's images go on display for the first time May 9 to August 3, 
the photographer explained that he was fascinated by Coney Island's 
uniquely uninhibited way of life.

'Where
 else could I find the variety of flesh so close and natural?' he said. 
 'Coney island represented the sea of humanity coming together from so 
many parts of the world to worship the sun and the sea.'

Ready for their closeup: In order to catch sunbathers off guard, Rose had to move quickly from place to place and be almost invisible

Lost in each other: The scantily clad strangers, like this young couple, appear blissfully unaware that they are being photographed at all

60s style: Rose's portraits and group photos also allow us to look back on the daring beach fashions from half a century ago

Big beautiful women: Many of the women in the images are distinctly Rubenesque - and inspiring in their approach to body image

Their private beach: Photography critic Vince Aletti has described Rose's Coney Island photographs as intimate portraits of people relaxing as if in the privacy of their own homes

Rose's photos do not shy away from strangers’ most private moments, often in closeup, as they appear blissfully unaware that they are being photographed at all.

The artist explained that in order to achieve that effect and allow people to behave naturally around him and his camera, he had to move very quickly and be almost invisible to those around him.

Photography critic Vince Aletti has described Rose's Coney Island photographs as remarkably intimate portraits of people relaxing as if in the privacy of their own homes.

Nap time: Some of the strangers depicted by Rose were caught snoozing on the beach - a great place for an afternoon catnap

Vintage look: Rose used special chemical processes and color to make his images look like they are radiating heat

The beach as seen in Rose's pictures is a way of life: the great equalizer welcoming the young, middle-aged and elderly.

Using special chemical processes and color, Rose’s Burnt-Sienna images seem to radiate pulsating, sweaty summer heat that brings to mind a day at the beach.

Like many of the subjects in his portraits, the pictures have a burnished, almost sun-tanned look.
