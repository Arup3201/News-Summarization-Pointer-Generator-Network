A young leopard found itself in a deep trouble, after it fell down a well in northeast India.

The poor animal was discovered trapped in the pit at Kamakhya temple in Guwahati, India. 

Forest officials, temple staff and volunteers all rallied around the narrow well to save the leopard and bring it back to the surface.

According to locals, the leopard had been scouring for food at the temple fell down the narrow well.

Forest officials were called to the scene where they were forced to tranquilize the animal before climbing a ladder and going down the pit.

They tied a rope around the groggy leopard and it was successfully pulled out of the hole.

After drying off the animal, forest officials transported it to a safe place for the leopard to recover before it is to be released into the wild.

The Indian leopard is smaller than 
its African relative, with the Indian leopard normally between 4ft 2in 
and 4ft 8in long, compared to the sub-Saharan leopard, which can grow to
be 5ft 4in long.

The leopard can be found across the Indian 
subcontinent, but as it is under threat from poachers and habitat loss is rarely found outside protected areas.

It is currently classified as ‘Near 
Threatened’ by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)
but as a result of the downward population trend it may soon qualify 
for a ‘Vulnerable‘ status.
