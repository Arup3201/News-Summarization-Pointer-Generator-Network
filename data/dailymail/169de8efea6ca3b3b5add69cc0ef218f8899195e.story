Brendan McBride, 19, died after getting his arm stuck in a charity clothes bin in Bradford, an inquest was told

A teenager died after getting stuck trying to climb into a clothes bank where he was hoping to sleep for the night, an inquest heard.

Brendan McBride, 19, was found by a passer-by suspended by his arm from the metal hatch of a charity clothes bin in Bradford.  He had bled to death.

It is thought that Mr McBride had been standing on a plastic container trying to reach into the bin when he slipped, trapping his arm and leaving him hanging.

He was found by a member of the public walking to work next morning but pronounced dead at the scene.

An inquest in Bradford heard how the hatch of the Save The Mothers Trust clothes bank in the Great Horton area of Bradford had caused a serious arm injury which led to significant blood loss. 

Mr McBride’s mother, Paula Denison, 44, from Bradford, said: 'I don't know why he would have been trying to get into the bin that night - he could have been looking for somewhere to sleep.'

'He had a home here [where] he could have a bed, a meal, a bath when he wanted.  He'd spend a couple of nights here, maybe, then at his dad's or his friend's.'

Mrs Denison, who has four other children, told the inquest she thought she had heard knocking on her door at midnight the night before her son's body was found.

She said: 'I thought I heard knocking at the back door at about midnight.  A neighbour said they heard something too, but I didn’t answer the door.

'Now I’m worried it could have been him.  I’ll have to live with that guilt.'

Assistant Bradford Coroner, Dr Dominic Bell, was told Mr McBride had been drinking the night before he was found and had told his mother he was going to visit friends. She told him to be back by 9.30pm, but he never returned. 

Mrs Denison said her son had started drinking too much after losing a job he loved at a car breakers’ yard. 

She said: 'We were worried about him.  When he was working he loved being busy, but then when the job went it all changed, everything started going down and he drank too much...

Location: Mr McBride was found by a passer-by near here in the Great Horton district of Bradford

The recently-unemployed teenager was found near Beckside Lane on 23 May by someone walking to work

'We are all heartbroken.  All we wanted for him was to enjoy his life, get another job and to be happy.'

She added: 'It was a freak accident that no-one could have predicted, and in the end no-one could have stopped.' 

Save The Mothers Trust spokesman, Mohammad Shahid, said the charity would now be putting up a bigger fence made from metal.

He said: 'We have been saying prayers for the young man and his family.'

The inquest continues.
