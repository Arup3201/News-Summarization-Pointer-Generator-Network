A Lithuanian builder was held last night after a wealthy property developer and his wife were found dead.

Viktoras Bruzas, 38, went on the run following the fatal stabbing of Patrick Kettyle, 55, and his wife Gillian Kettyle, 54, in an attack at their £750,000 Surrey home.

After a ten-hour manhunt Bruzas was stopped by police in his Mercedes at 6pm last night in Oxshott, Surrey, just five miles from the scene of the double murder. 

Surrey Police had been urgently searching for 38-year-old Lithuanian builder Viktoras Bruzas (right) after the bodies of married couple Patrick (left), 55, and Gillian Kettyle, 54, were discovered at about 12.30am yesterday

Mr Kettyle (pictured) and his wife  are said to have known Bruzas, and the two suspects were also known to each other

Police had been called just after midnight yesterday by Mrs Kettyle’s 16-year-old son Timothy, who is said to have witnessed a knifeman lashing out, stabbing his victims in the chest, head and legs.

Paramedics tried to save the couple but they died at the scene.

Kristina Bruziene, is reportedly the estranged wife of Bruzas. She was employed by the dead couple as a secretary in 2012

Police confirmed that Bruzas and the Kettyle family were known to each other, and said this relationship was an ‘important part’ of their investigation.

Mr Kettyle had employed Bruzas’s ex-wife, Kristina Bruziene, 37, as a secretary at his million-pound building and property development firm after the builder introduced them.

Bruzas grew up in Kaunas, Lithuania, the country’s second biggest city, 65 miles west of the capital, Vilnius.

He married his wife in Lithuania before they moved to the UK in their twenties. The couple settled in Forest Gate, East London, and had their son Richard, who was born in September 2007.

Bruzas was known by his neighbours as a quiet man who worked hard to support his family, doing odd jobs in people’s homes and fixing locks.

Apparently earning well, he moved with his family five years ago to a £400,000 home in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey.

Bruzas was working as a builder for Mr Kettyle’s construction firm while his wife handled the accounts.

Pictures posted on Facebook suggest they were happy, devoted parents.

A window at the Kettyle's home appears to have been smashed. The middle-aged couple were found by a family member who was not hurt in the attack, police revealed at a press conference

A police spokesman said: 'A potential weapon has been found near the property and we are currently examining it. But we cannot confirm if it is linked to the incident at this early stage'

A forensics officer could be seen putting the knife, which had a black and silver handle and appeared to have a bent and broken blade, into a plastic evidence container

Last night another man in his 30s arrested in Walton-on-Thames on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder was released on police bail.

Police were called at around 12.30am on Thursday and issued an appeal seven hours later to find Bruzas, whom they believed was on his way to West Sussex.

But he was later found just five miles away and arrested on suspicion of murder.

Last night detectives were examining a knife with a broken blade found by a dog walker not far from the murder scene, in the leafy stockbroker village of Fetcham.

The killer is believed to have smashed a glass window in a conservatory at the rear of the house to gain entry.

Stunned neighbours described the Kettyles as a quiet, friendly couple who were often seen taking Mrs Kettyle’s son to his grammar school in Guildford where he recently achieved top GCSE grades.

The couple married in 2004 and have three children between them from previous marriages.

Last night Mrs Kettyle’s stunned niece and nephew Bronwyn, 21, and Lewis Davies, 18, said: ‘It’s the worst thing that could have happened. They were fantastic people. It’s so sad for the whole family.

‘They didn’t deserve this. It’s a tragic loss. Patrick was such a gentle man, he was always so loving. It just doesn’t feel real at all, it’s such a shock.’

Mr Kettyle founded his own construction company, Kettyle Ltd, in 1985 which had a £6million annual turnover and also let several properties.

He is understood to have retired, but it is thought his wife worked as an office administrator in nearby Cobham, Surrey.

The Kettyles were close friends of Friends Reunited founders Steve and Julie Pankhurst who made £30million from the sale of the site in 2005.

Neighbour Gwynaeth Laxton, 80, said: ‘I am in complete shock and feeling quite shaken up about it. We had not long been asleep when we heard a commotion outside.

‘I thought it was foxes or other animals jumping over the fence. But then a short while later we heard the police turn up.’ 

Speaking at a press conference, Detective Superintendent Nick May, said the couple had been subjected to a 'sustained attack'

At the scene, police tape was stretched across the street to cordon off a large area outside the house, while shocked residents chatted in the road

The head of Surrey and Sussex Joint Major Crime Team, Detective Superintendent Nick May, said: ‘At this stage we believe that the offender or offenders entered the property at some time after midnight and subjected the victims to a sustained attack.

'Officers and paramedics were called to the scene at around 12.30am by a family member who was in the property at time but was unharmed in the attack.’

Prior to Bruzas’s arrest, police had been liaising with both the National Crime Agency and Interpol, who were in touch with the Lithuanian authorities.

Officers also carried out a fingertip search of a street close to the Kettyles’ home, checking residents’ front gardens, and emptying household bins.
