Five nurses were today found guilty of neglect at a care home where malnourished pensioners lived on porridge and had pressure sores so deep that their bones were exposed.

The abuse came to light after five residents aged between 83 and 100 died in just two weeks at the scandal-hit Parkside House Nursing Home in Northampton.

Home manager Phyllis Johnson and nurses Anastacia Madulu, Girlie Franklin, Maria McKenzie, and Mary Ombui, were all found guilty of failing to provide basic care to ten residents between them.

Johnson was also found guilty of not reporting the deaths of three residents to the Care and Quality Commission, and failing to provide them nutritious meals and ensure staff were adequately trained.

The residents died at the site between July 22 and August 6, 2009, after being left malnourished, immobile in bed, and with putrid pressure sores, a hearing was told.

Concerns were first raised when an elderly woman was admitted to Northampton General Hospital on July 21, 2009 with severe pressure sores on her heels exposing her bones and tendons.

She was unresponsive and died the next day, exhibiting signs of dehydration and malnourishment.

Another resident with severe pressure sores died on the same day at the home, while three people were shipped out of the home over fears for their health.

The third vulnerable pensioner died in a community hospital on July 28 while two died in separate care homes on August 4 and 6.

Alzheimer’s sufferer Doreen Sheridan, 83, died on August 4 after contracting bronchopneumonia which doctors said was caused by a lack of movement.

Healthcare manager Karen Stagg undertook an assessment of some of the residents on July 24 following ‘serious concerns’ about the care provided.

Mrs Stagg reported a series of fundamental failings, including staff who could not use basic equipment, residents fed ‘mainly porridge’ and meaningless care plans that were out of date.

One female pensioner who suffered from physical and mental disabilities had skin which ‘appeared to be paper thin and dry’.

Mrs Stagg had told the panel that an elderly woman at the home had a sore that was ‘necrotic and yellow, slow to heal and granulating’.

One pressure sore she inspected was 2.8in across and 2.4in deep - deep enough to ‘feel the bone’, the panel heard.

Parkside House’s remaining residents were moved elsewhere and its registration was later cancelled. A serious case review into the deaths found the ‘causes considered to be consistent with the effects of severe neglect’.

Madulu, who represented herself at the hearing, and Ombui, who was with her representative, admitted all allegations against them on the basis that McKenzie prevented them from providing basic treatment to patients.

McKenzie and Franklin were found guilty of the bulk of the charges relating to the residents - referred to as A, B, C, D, E, F, G H, I and J - including failing to provide adequate care.

But the pair were cleared of charges including not completing nutrition risk assessments for certain residents, failing to monitor the weight of some residents and not using documentation to help monitor care.

Johnson, who denied all the charges, did not attend the Central London hearing and has now retired to Trinidad and Tobago.

She was found guilty of the majority of the charges against her and cleared of failing to review procedures and policies at the home and failing to notify the CQC when Residents A, B and C were admitted to hospital.

If the nurses are found guilty of misconduct, they could face being barred from the profession.

Two other Parkside House nurses, Alice Nojozi and Nobuhle Moyo, were let off with cautions following earlier Nursing and Midwifery Council hearings.

The hearing continues with the panel set to decide on whether the charges amount to misconduct tomorrow, before moving on to sanction.
