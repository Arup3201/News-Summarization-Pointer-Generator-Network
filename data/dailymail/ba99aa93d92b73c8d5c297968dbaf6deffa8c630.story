The daughter of a man who died in a house fire faced the horrifying ordeal of finding her father's body after firefighters failed to see the corpse in the ruins.

Larry Pearman, 61, was inside his home when the fire started last Thursday but the outcome of his death has not been determined. Foul play was not suspected and an autopsy has been scheduled for today.

Mr Pearman's body was not found by firefighters who tackled the blaze near Halltown in Lawrence County, Missouri.

Mr Pearman's daughter Kelly and her boyfriend discovered her father in his living room armchair when they went to the scene later that day, according to ABC.

A distraught Miss Pearman told local station KY3 News: 'It's been difficult...because it's all I think about.

It was reported that firefighters didn't look for any victims as they were under the impression that no one was home when the fire broke out. Mr Pearman, who lived alone and had health problems, was buried under rubble.

The sheriff said it was unacceptable that firefighters missed Mr Pearman's body. An investigation is currently under way to determine the cause of the fire.
