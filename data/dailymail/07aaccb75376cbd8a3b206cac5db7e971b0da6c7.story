Holland have under Louis van Gaal developed a style more like "Power Football" than the fabled "Total Football" - which came to the fore in the seventies with Johan Cruyff the inspiration.

It’s highly effective, with Holland having won all their group games and scored 10 goals. But Cruyff is critical and wants to see the Dutch turn on the style against Mexico and, ironically, be more German by turning their old power game into a more attractive style

'The Oranje has qualified but the football isn't that good,' the Dutch legend said.

Not impressed: But Dutch legend Johan Cruyff says the team should be playing more like Germany

'I liked the way that Germany kept playing in their own style – even during the moments when things weren't going well against Ghana.

'That's the way Netherlands should be playing as well. The results are good, now we have to start playing good football.' 

Mexico will test just how good Holland’s counter-attacking is, given that they have proved to have one of the toughest defences so far.

Along with Belgium and Costa Rica, Mexico are the only team to have conceded just one goal.

Cult hero: Mexico coach Miguel Herrera is one of the most popular bosses at the World Cup in Brazil

They have made 42 tackles compared to a tournament average of 36.7 and have achieved 121 recovered balls compared to 88.8. Also, there have been nine offsides given in their favour against an average of 4.9.

He is hardly the best known but Mexico coach Miguel Herrera has become a cult hero.

His impassioned touchline antics, plus the generous was he treats fans, has seen him gather nearly 800,000 twitter followers; easily the most of any coach at the World Cup.

Colombian Jorge Luis Pinto is Costa Rica’s coach, but just after World War Two they had an Englishman in charge. Randolph Galloway, a pre-War striker for Derby and Nottingham Forest, managed several clubs in Europe – including Valencia and Racing Santander – and briefly took charge of Costa Rica in 1946

Oh and the last time they made the round of 16 on their World Cup debut in 1990, memorably beating Scotland 1-0 on their way to qualifying behind Brazil in their group. But they were then beat 4-1 by Czechoslovakia.

Fine job: Costa Rica's Colombian coach Jorge Luis Pinto exceeded all expectations by guiding them through the group stage

Georgios Samaras is a familiar face after spending two years at Manchester City then six at Celtic.

He will be the focal point of the Greece attack on Sunday night and is the player Costa Rica need to stop having ended a goal drought that lasted 1,478 minutes with his last minute penalty winner against the Ivory Coast.

Now 29m his contract has expired with Celtic and he could move back to the Premier League. Everton have expressed interested. Sevilla are also looking at him.

I-say

Brazil are still favourites to win the World Cup but I say they are there for the taking when they face Colombia in the quarter finals on Friday.

It was not a surprise they were taken all the way by Chile and only scrambled over the line on penalties on Saturday.

With the exception of Neymar they have been distinctly lacking in Samba skills upfront and ironically for them have been indebted to a pretty tough defence.

No mistake: Neymar handled the pressure of the penalty shoot-out and sent Brazil into the last eight at the expense of Chile

Off beat: Fred (left) has struggled to find his best form in the tournament so far as was again pretty ineffectual against Chile

Hulk and Fred don’t seem up to it and Oscar hasn’t clicked.

It’s as if they have been carried through on the wave of emotion and support that surrounds. It could still see them through but Colombia, familiar opponents in the Copa America, won’t be fazed and with James Rodriguez up front could well deny Brazil’s dream of winning the World Cup on home soil as Uruguay did in 1950.

One to Watch

Giorgos Karagounis is a modern-day Greek god.

He was an inspiration when Greece won the 2004 Euros and is still going strong at the age of 37.

He will retire from international football after the tournament and is out of contract at Fulham.

But in what is dubbed the clash of the underdogs he has still has the energy and passion to drive Greece who, like Costa Rica, are seeking to reach the quarter-finals for the first time.

World Cup moment

It’s argued that Holland’s 1974 were the best side never to win a World Cup.

They couldn’t have go off to a better start when English referee Jack Taylor awarded them a penalty in the first minute, which was converted, but Germany, led by Franz Beckenbauer, bounced back to win 2-1.

The Dutch lost the 1978 final too but have so far showed they can at last be champions.

World Cup Bet

Holland to win and both teams to score is 4-1.

The Dutch to beat Mexico 3-1 is 18-1

Costa Rica v Greece could be a slog so a draw at 90 minutes at 2-1 is prudent… 1-1 is is 11-2 and 2-2 is 20-1.
