Team news

Liverpool 

Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard, fellow midfielder Jordan Henderson and forward Raheem Sterling are all expected to be recalled for the visit of league leaders Chelsea.

The trio were among seven players left out of the midweek defeat at Real Madrid but not all are guaranteed to return.

Good performances by the likes of centre-back Kolo Toure and forward Fabio Borini could see them retain their places.

Provisional squad: Mignolet, Johnson, Skrtel, Toure, Moreno, Gerrard, Henderson, Allen, Coutinho, Sterling, Borini, Balotelli, Jones, Manquillo, Lovren, Can, Markovic, Lucas, Lallana, Lambert.

Chelsea 

Striker Diego Costa will start for Premier League leaders Chelsea at Liverpool despite being left out of the Spain squad to recover from his persistent hamstring trouble.

Striker Loic Remy (groin) and midfielder John Obi Mikel (knee) are available following recent injuries, with Jose Mourinho having a fully-fit squad to choose from.

Full-back Cesar Azpilicueta is available again after completing his three-match domestic suspension following his dismissal against Crystal Palace.

Provisional squad: Courtois, Cech, Ivanovic, Luis, Fabregas, Zouma, Ake, Ramires, Oscar, Hazard, Drogba, Mikel, Schurrle, Salah, Costa, Remy, Matic, Willian, Cahill, Terry, Azpilicueta, Christensen, Baker, Schwarzer.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

After a run of four successive Premier League wins against Chelsea, Liverpool are winless in four against the Blues (D2 L2).

Eden Hazard has scored in two of his three Premier League appearances against Liverpool.

Cesc Fabregas has recorded nine goal assists already for Chelsea this season, more than any Blues player managed last season.

Only four players set up more goals in the whole of last season’s Premier League than Fabregas has created this term (Gerrard 13, Suarez 12, Lambert 10 & Rooney 10).

Luis Suarez, Andy Carroll and Maxi Rodriguez all starred in Liverpool's last win over Chelsea, a 4-1 triumph at Anfield in a May 2012 Premier League clash

Only three teams have ever had more points than Chelsea (26) have accrued after 10 games of a season in Premier League history (Man City 2011-12 28, Chelsea 2005-06 28 & Newcastle 1995-96 27).

Liverpool have had fewer points at this stage in four Premier League seasons and in each case they finished outside the top four – 1992-93 6th, 1993-94 8th, 2010-11 6th and 2012-13 7th).

Despite that, the Reds have gone on to finish in the top four on the three previous occasions that they have had exactly 14 points after 10 games.

Jose Mourinho’s side have been the most clinical in the top flight scoring with 23% of their attempts.

Chelsea have netted four goals in the opening 15 minutes of matches this season, more than any other team in the top flight.

Half of the Premier League goals Chelsea have conceded this season have come in the final 15 minutes of matches.
