Daphne Oz stormed the New York Fashion Week runway yesterday at eight months pregnant.

The Chew co-host and daughter of Dr. Mehmet Oz wore a Sarah Liller-designed gown for the annual Heart Truth Red Dress Collection show, which benefits both the American Heart Association’s Go Red For Women movement and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.

Ms Oz, 27, starred in the show 
alongside fellow personalities like Taryn Manning, Giada de Laurentis, 
Ireland Baldin, and Joan Jett.

The nutrition advocate - who is 
expecting her first child in March with husband of three years John 
Jovanovic - danced down the runway in her bump-hugging ensemble.

Unlike many of the show’s outfits, Ms Oz’s look had a decidedly casual feel.

Her semi-sheer lace gown was paired with sensible combat boots – a practical approach to maternity fashion.

Its blouson silhouette also complimented Ms Oz’s growing shape.

Ms Oz made her runway appearance just days after her Pinterest-ready baby shower, which she hosted last weekend.

She has also celebrated her pregnancy by appearing on the cover of this month’s Fit Pregnancy magazine.

Inside the issue, Ms Oz instructs fellow expectant mothers on how to remain in-shape and slim during their pregnancies.

She provided readers with meal inspirations, saying ‘for lunch I do sandwiches with avocados and cheese or hummus. Or a big salad.’

Another option, she said, are smoothies which ‘are a great way to get a huge dose of nutrition and not think about it.’
