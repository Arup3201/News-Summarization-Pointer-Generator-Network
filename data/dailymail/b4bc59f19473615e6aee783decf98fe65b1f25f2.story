A Major League Baseball player has been ordered to pay more child support despite just singing the fourth largest contract in leauge history.

Robinson Cano, who has just joined the Seatlle Mariners for $240million (£147m), has been ordered by a judge in the Dominican Republic to pay an extra $600 a month to support his three-year-old son, Robinson Miguel, who lives there with his mother Jackelin Castro, 38.

That money will form a 'provisional pension' and will be on top of the $600 he already pays in child support, but Castro says she will be going back to court and pushing for $25,000 a month.

Robinson Cano, who has just singed a $240million contacts with the Mariners, has been ordered to pay an extra $600 a month in child support

However Jackelin Castro is asking for $25,000 a month in order to support their son Robinson Miguel

Speaking to the New York Daily News she said: 'It’s never consistent,We’re talking about someone who made $15 million last season.

'Robinson, the son, he doesn’t have a secure income as of now. That’s a shame.'

She claims that child support and the $100 a month she receives as a pension for being a retired volleyball player, are not enough to raise the boy.

She added: 'His son doesn’t even go to see his dad at games. That’s not fair to the kid.

'All I wish is that his dad was more involved in his son’s life. My son deserves better.'

Cano and Castro, who were a couple between 2008 and 2011, have been embroiled in a long-running child-support dispute.

In October she claimed Cano had a lawyer come to her home in February to try and get her to agree to accept $600 a month over the next 10 years, which she refused.

‘The intention of him and his advisers was somewhat to intimidate me,’ Castro told ESPN.com. 

Cano, who made $15 million last season, disputed the mother’s claims in a statement.

Former New York Yankees star Cano, has been accused of neglecting the upkeep of his three-year-son son who lives in the Dominican Republic with the baseball player's ex-girlfriend

Jackelin Castro says Cano's support is intermittent and her son isn't even invited to watch his dad play

Castro has previously claimed Cano sent a lawyer to her home to get her to accept $600 a month

‘I have gone above and beyond to care
for my child including an agreed upon monthly stipend, a house, a car, 
insurance, school and other essentials for the baby and his mother as 
well many other things including toys and clothing,’ he said.

‘This
is a private matter and I will not fight it in the media, nor will I 
say anything disparaging about the mother of my child or comment any 
further. I look forward to an amicable resolution that will allow me 
time with my son.’

Castro has complained the Cano’s $600 a month payments are delivered sporadically by a relative and without notice. Her lawyer Wendy Diaz is demanding $25,000 a month.

‘I believe the money he gives to the son, when he does, is not enough to feed the dogs of Robinson Cano’s house,’ Diaz said.

‘Maybe he is expending more money on the dogs and cars that he has than on his own child.’

Castro has also attacked Cano's public image including the RC24 Foundation, which helps underprivileged children

Castro also attacked Cano’s public image that he conveys through his RC24 Foundation, which helps underserved children.

‘What hurts me most [is] he shows the world that he helps children, that he's a good person, he's very humane,’ she said.

‘So with something of his own, he may trick the world and everybody who sees him because he's the big star that he is, but there's a reality, which is a son who doesn't [receive] the quality of life he's supposed to.’
