More than 6,000 children across England have been reported as at risk of sexual exploitation in the past 18 months, according to new figures.

The data, collected by Channel 4, shows that 6,300 children aged under 16 have been flagged up to social services for being vulnerable to exploitation since January last year.

The figures, which were obtained from 88 councils across the country, have been disclosed following the Rotherham sex abuse scandal where more than 1,400 children were sexually abused over a 16-year period.

According to the new information, social services were aware of 3,202 children at risk in 2013 and a total of 3,009 children were referred to social services, or known to them already, in the first six months of 2014.

The data shows that those as young as newborn babies and toddlers could have been exploited and the council reported potential exploitation of children aged between nine and 14 through gangs, social media, family members and massage parlours.

Children were found to be most at risk in northern regions, with 452 deemed at risk in Manchester, 407 in Derbyshire, 363 in Sheffield and 311 in Blackburn and Darwen.

However, the problem is not just confined to the north, as the data shows that children are at risk nationwide – including 256 in the London borough of Havering, 230 in Northamptonshire, 196 in Hampshire and 140 in Southampton.

Of those reported at risk, the majority were girls but 523 cases involved young boys.

Ann Coffey, the Labour MP for Stockport who is chairing an inquiry into child exploitation, said agencies were being more pro-active in tackling exploitation nowadays.

She told Channel 4 News: 'I think that child sexual exploitation has been under-identified for a very long time - part of the reason being that victims feel they are going to be blamed for what happened to them.

'Agencies are being much more proactive in going out and identifying children at risk of sexual exploitation and hopefully intervening before that sexual exploitation and the trauma that it causes children occurs.'

She also said that with proper information being widely available, the public may become better at recognising the signs and symptoms of sexual exploitation in their own neighbourhood, making it easier for them to report children who are at risk.

The issue of 'victim blaming' by the agencies and authorities who were tasked to support the children had been 'a real problem for victims' in the past, but Ms Coffey said this situation was now changing.

She said: 'I don't think the police can deal with this by themselves - that is why we need to engage the community.'

According to the NSPCC, child sexual exploitation involves the manipulation or coercion of young people under the age of 18 into sexual activity in exchange for money, gifts, accommodation, affection or status.
