Leicester City have had a bid accepted for Queens Park rangers right back Danny Simpson.

The 27-year-old joined Rangers last summer, and played 34 games in the Championship to help the club achieve promotion to the Premier League. 

But the arrival on loan of Chilean wing back Mauricio Isla has left the former Newcastle defender surplus to requirements at Loftus Road.

A new start: Danny Simpson (left) has been a consistent performer for QPR but looks set to join Leicester  

Replaced: Mauricio Isla (left) has joined on loan from Juventus and taken the right wing back slot 

Rangers manager Harry Redknapp confirmed that the Foxes had made a bid, and said the deal was likely to happen.

Redknapp also praised the full back for his efforts at the club, and said: 'I think it's going to happen. Danny's a good lad, a good player. He did a great job for us last year.'

Nigel Pearson's Leicester team have conceded four goals in their first two league games, and it is hoped Simpson will help to shore things up at the back.  

Committed: QPR manager Harry Redknapp said Simpson will leave but 'he did a great job for us last year'
