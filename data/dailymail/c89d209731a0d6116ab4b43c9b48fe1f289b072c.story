A US pilot and his British passenger have been killed in a joyride flight after their Second World War   P-51 Mustang fighter crashes off Galveston coast.

Police said Keith Hibbett, 51, of Denton, Texas, was flying the plane, 
and John Stephen Busby, 66, from Britain, was the plane's only 
passenger.

The cause of the accident has not been determined, but the pilot was not in contact with air traffic control just before the crash at about noon local time, Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Lynn Lunsford said.

The P-51 Mustang was manufactured in 1944, according to FAA records, and owned by the Texas Aviation Hall of Fame, a part of the Lone Star Flight Museum in Galveston.

Mr Busby had paid the museum to take the flight as part of a program offered by the museum.

Mr Busby and his wife had been visiting to celebrate their 41st wedding anniversary.

Recovery: Emergency crews recovered the bodies after combing over Chocolate Bay for about an hour

According to museum officials, Hibbett was an experienced pilot.

US Coast Guard petty officer Steve Lehmann said the captain of a charter boat notified authorities after seeing the crash in an area between Chocolate Bay and Galveston Bay.

He said the plane went down in water 4ft deep.

Emergency crews recovered the bodies after combing over Chocolate Bay for about an hour, KHOU.com reported.

The P-51 Mustang was the nemesis of the Luftwaffe, shooting down over 4,900 enemy planes and therefore, greatly assisted the bombing campaign against Nazi Germany in World War Two.

It gave the bombers of US 8th Air Force the fighter cover it so desperately needed over occupied Europe.

The P-51 was originally ordered in April 1940 by the British Air Purchasing Commission.

There was a realisation in Britain that its bomber squadrons were open to attack during bombing raids and that Fighter Command did not have the aircraft available to give Bomber Command sufficient protection.

The P51 Mustang had an astonishing success rate - its ratio for kills to losses was said to have been 19 kills for every 1 Mustang lost.

Such was the success of the Mustang, that the Senate War Investigating Committee set up by Harry Truman in 1944, called it 'the most aerodynamically perfect pursuit plane in existence.'

Witnesses told police the plane went down without warning or any signs of trouble.

Jennifer Spaulding told KHOU.com she was on another boat and she heard the impact of the crash.

'We saw the water spraying up in the air, but we never saw what it was,' Spaulding said.

'We never saw a plane go down or anything, so we didn’t think anything like a plane. We just figured it was a boat.'

According to the museum website, the plane was used by the El Salvadoran Air Force in the 1960s, during which time the one-person plane was modified to allow it to carry two people.

It had been painted with the markings of the Galveston Gal, a tribute to the World War II fighter group of a Galveston native.

The museum offered rides in the plane for $1,995 for one passenger, according to its website.

Museum officials did not respond to requests for comment.

Investigators with the FAA and National Transportation Safety Board will investigate the cause of the crash.

In 2011 a pilot and 10 people on the ground died when a souped-up World War II-era P-51 Mustang fighter crashed into spectators at an air race in Reno.

Investigators said it bore modifications that weakened its structure and showed evidence that the pilot flew it beyond its limits.

Pilot Jimmy Leeward was blamed for failing to fully document and test extensive modifications to the aircraft before the September 2011 crash which left over 70 people injured.
