She's known for splashing about in the water - and were she a dog she admits she would probably be a breed that enjoys doing much the same.

British Olympic swimming sensation Rebecca Adlington has revealed her inner dog is a Golden Retriever or Labrador, 'because I'm big and blonde and slobbery!'.

Puppy love: Rebecca Adlington with a Battersea Dogs Home resident at the Collars & Coats Gala Ball 2012

The 23-year-old dog lover from 
Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, was attending the Battersea Dogs & Cats 
Home Coats & Collars Gala Ball 2012 in Battersea Park in London last
night.

Speaking to MailOnline, Adlington 
said: 'I absolutely love dog. I've got two, my mum and dad have two, and
my sister has two, so whenever we go home at weekends there's six 
little terrors running around causing mayhem.

'If I were a dog I'd definitely be a Golden Retreiver or a Labrador because I'm big and blonde and slobbery!'

Last
night's event saw model residents from the famous dog rescue home 
strutting their four-legged stuff on the dogwalk, wearing coats and 
collars made by designers including VIvienne Westwood, Jenny Packham, 
Philip Treacy, Julien Macdonald, Matthew Williamson, Henry Holland, 
Giles Deacon and Faberge.

The coats are being auctioned online to raise money for Battersea and help the home care for 9,000 dogs and cats every year.

Other celebrities in attendance included
Dolce & Gabanna model and Battersea Ambassador David Gandy and his 
model girlfriend Sarah Ann Macklin - who said they would be a spaniel 
and a dachshund, respectively.

Guest Tamara Ecclestone, who has two dogs, said her sister Petra often likens her to a particular breed of dog.

The daughter of Formula One supremo 
Bernie Ecclestone said: I shouldn't say this but my sister always says I
have the characteristics of a bulldog because I'm lazy and stubborn. If
I were a bulldog I'd wear something Union Jack.'

She added: 'I have two chihuahaus 
called Frankie and Duke, but they hate when I try to make them wear 
clothes. And my sister only has big dogs and it's hard to get a 
Rottweiler into anything. But I see lots of sequins in doggy style for 2013.'

Actress Amanda Holden hosted the 
ceremony alongside presenter Paul O'Grady, and admitted her inner pooch 
is a Shih Tzu: 'Just because I like saying the word!'

Designer
Henry Holland said he would most probably be a red setter with long 
hair and corn rows, and Zandra Rhodes said she'd be a spaniel covered in
diamonds.

Sarah Ann Macklin, model: 'I'd be a dachshund because they're long, like me.'

Amanda Holden, actor: 'I'd be a Shih Tzu - just because I like saying the word!'

Zandra Rhodes, designer: 'I'd be a poodle and I'd wear lots of jewellery - poodles look fabulous in diamonds!'
