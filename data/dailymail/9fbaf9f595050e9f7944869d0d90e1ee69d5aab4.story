A doctor could spent the rest of her life in prison if found guilty of poisoning the co-worker with whom she was having an affair. 

The trial for breast cancer doctor Ana Maria Gonzalez-Angulo began today in Houston, Texas. The 43-year-old stands accused of spiking her ex-lover Dr George Blumenschein's coffee with antifreeze. 

The two met working at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center and started a casual sexual relationship in 2011, while Blumenschein was living with his long-term girlfriend, Evette Toney.

In their opening statements on Monday, prosecutors argued that Gonzalez-Angulo had a 'fatal attraction' to Blumenschein, and poisoned him when she found out that his girlfriend had suffered a miscarriage.

'This case is about a woman who was totally obsessed,' Assistant Harris County District Attorney Justin Keiter said.

Blumenschein told his lover about the miscarriage last year, at which point Gonzalez-Angula allegedly started to make strange claims.

She told her co-worker that she had been getting anonymous and threatening phone calls and that she had been attacked by a man and woman outside her home.  

On the morning of January 27, 2013, Blumenschein left his home to go to Gonzalez-Angula's house, where they drank a shot of vodka and engaged in oral sex before work.

Sickening: Traces of the chemical ethylene glycol were found in Blumenschein's system. The chemical is a common ingredient in automotive antifreeze 

Afterwards, Gonzalez-Angula made Blumenschein a cup of special Colombian coffee allegedly laced with ethylene glycol, a chemical commonly found in automotive antifreeze. 

Blumenschein drank one cup at his girlfriend's house, and one cup once they got to work, after Gonzalez-Angula packed it in a travel mug. 

He reportedly complained about the coffee being too sweet, and thought it was strange since his girlfriend knew he preferred black coffee. She reportedly insisted that he drink it, even though it wasn't made to his liking.

Hours later, Blumenschein began to feel tipsy at work and that evening, he cut himself while making a snack.

Knowing something was wrong, Blumenschein drove himself back to work at the hospital where doctors discovered he was suffering kidney failure. 

Thanks to his quick thinking, Blumenschein survived the poisoning. 

Gonzalez-Angulo was charged with aggravated assault five months later.

However, her defense says there is no conclusive proof that  the coffee was poisoned, and that the prosecution has dramatized the relationship 'to fit a theory that just doesn't match the facts'.

'This man is a distinguished physician who is frankly a committed life-long bachelor,' defense attorney Andy Drumheller said. ' He is going to come in here...all 6-foot-3 inches of him and try to suggest to you that that woman forced herself on him. That suggestion is laughable.' 

Jurors will also get the opportunity to see surveillance footage of Gonzalez-Angulo in the emergency room with Blumenschein after the poisoning, which the defense believes will prove her innocence. 

'That video doesn't point to her guilt,' Drumheller said. 'It points decidedly to her innocence.'

It is also alleged that Blumenschein could have ingested the lethal chemicals on a business trip a few days before he got sick. 

The trial is expected to last two weeks.
