A woman conned her husband into thinking that he was the father of her son after undergoing IVF treatment using her ex-boyfriend's sperm, a court heard.

The husband, who has not been named to protect the identity of the child, said that in 2004, he and his wife travelled to a clinic in Barcelona, Spain, where he gave a sample of his sperm.

But he claims a few months later the woman returned to the clinic without him and was impregnated with her ex-boyfriends sperm instead. The couple have since divorced. 

The man, a lecturer in his 60s, claims that he paid more than £80,000 in maintenance towards the child over a number of years and is now seeking more than £100,000 in damages.

The businesswoman, who is representing herself at the hearing, says there is 'no merit' in her ex-husband’s claim. 

Barrister Thomas Brudenell, who represented the man at Central London County Court, said his client was claiming damages for 'deceit'.

He said the man did not know at the time that his wife, who is in her 50s, had used her ex-boyfriend's sperm, although it was 'now quite clear what had happened'.

Mr Brudenell said the little boy was born in late 2005 and when he was around six months old the couple separated. Divorce proceedings began and their divorce was finalised in 2008.

He addded the man looked after the child when the woman was working and paid more than £80,000 in maintenance over the following few years

In 2011 a dispute arose over the amount of contact he was having with the child - and the woman then told him that he was not the 'biological father'.

Shortly afterwards that was confirmed when he took a DNA test.

A lawyer told the judge today that the case was thought to be the first of its kind.

The judge was told that the man was in his 60s, the woman was in her 50s, and the little boy was nine. She heard that the man and woman lived in different parts of the London area.

The hearing continues and is expected to end tomorrow.
