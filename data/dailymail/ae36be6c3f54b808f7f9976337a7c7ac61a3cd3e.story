It might not be the safest place to nestle down for the night, but one resourceful - if foolhardy - blue tit has been captured on camera making a home inside a silver cigarette bin. 

The small bird well known in the UK for its white, blue, green and yellow feathers alights on a opening designed for  cigarette butts to be thrown though.

It has a quick look around before flying off again. The same bird returns and, without a thought, disappears straight inside.

But making a nest inside may not be such a bad idea at all. The cigarette bin is secure, out of reach of predators  and warm - so long as no one uses it to stub out their Benson & Hedges in.

There have been other reported instances of blue tits seeking haven in similar spots. 

At Fairlawns Hotel, Aldridge in the West Midlands blue tits were spotted flying in and out of a cigarette bin on the outside wall of a function room, prompting management to put up a sign warning smokers not to use it.

Another family of tits made their home in an ash tray bolted next to the entrance to a new community hall in Boat of Garten in the Cairngorms National Park. 

Winter can be a dire time for hungry blue tits.

Families join up with other flocks to search for food and, according to the RSPB, a garden with four or five blue tits at a feeder at any one time may be feeding 20 or more.
