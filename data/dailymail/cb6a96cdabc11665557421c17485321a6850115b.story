He is his great rival in the battle to prove who is best at running the economy and the country.

But Ed Balls has challenged George Osborne to join him in running the London Marathon.

Labour's shadow chancellor threw down the gauntlet to the top Tory after discovering they were both following the 5:2 diet fad.

Running mates: Ed Balls has run the London Marathon twice before, but wants George Osborne to join him this year

Mr Balls has twice completed the grueling 26-mile run through the capital. In 2012 he finished in 5 hours and 31 minutes, insisting he would never do it again.

'The euphoria only lasted so long before the pain really set in,' he said.

But he donned his trainers again last year, shaving 17 minutes off his time and raising £100,000 for charity.

Now he has issued the invitation to his great political foe to join him in this year's race.

'Mr Balls told The Sun: 'George Osborne sponsored my last two marathons for Action for Stammering Children and Whizz-Kidz.. Now he's trying to get in shape, maybe he'll join me this year.'

Labour aides said they are yet to receive a response to the invitation from Mr Osborne, who is in Sydney for a meeting of the G20.

The challenge came after the Mail revealed Mr Osborne was following the 5:2 diet, which means he has to fast twice a week. Mr Balls has previously been a devotee of the weight-loss plan.

Mr Osborne imposed austerity measures on his food intake as part of an 
image makeover, which aides hope will boost his chances of succeeding 
David Cameron.

The Chancellor has also been pictured sweating and exhausted running around St James’s Park, across the road from the Treasury.

The Chancellor has already abandoned his foppish former haircut in favour of a close cropped Caesar cut, which his allies believe looks more serious.

A Government source said: ‘George is on the 5-2 diet. Given the job he’s doing turning around the health of the economy, it’s unsurprising that he’s keeping himself in shape as well.’

Ahead of last year's spending review Mr Osborne tweeted this picture of himself tucking into an upmarket Byron burger

The diet requires Mr Osborne to limit his intake to 600 calories two days a week and eat normally on the other five.

That
 would allow him to continue enjoying occasional indulgences like the 
Byron burger he was pictured with at the time of the Budget last year.

On that occasion, Mr Osborne tweeted a picture of his dinner from the upmarket chain as he was preparing his big speech.

A "Classic" Byron 6oz hamburger with 
lettuce, tomato, red onion and mayonnaise costs £6.75 with fries an 
extra £2.95. If cheese is added, the price of the burger rises to £7.95.

Mr
 Osborne’s quest to get into shape first became apparent last year when 
he was spotted wearing a computerised wristband called the Jawbone Up, 
which monitors the amount of exercise he takes and the quality of his 
sleep.

He has not been slow to taunt Eric Pickles, the corpulent Communities Secretary, repeatedly telling gags about his weight in speeches at Tory Party conference. Mr Pickles once hit back, tweeting an image of himself eating a salad.

Treasury officials declined to discuss how the Chancellor is coping with the diet or what foods he is surviving on during fast days.
