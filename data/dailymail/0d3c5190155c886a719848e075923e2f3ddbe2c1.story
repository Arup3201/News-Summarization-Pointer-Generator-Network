Paul Scholes says he doesn't expect to be part of Louis van Gaal's coaching set-up next season, as Manchester United look to rebuild on a disappointing campaign.

The 39-year-old rejoined the Red Devils as part of Ryan Giggs' interim backroom staff in April following the sacking of former manager David Moyes.

However, Scholes has admitted he hasn't had any contact with executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward about his future.

'I’ve not spoken to Edward Woodward,' he said in his first column for Paddy Power.

'I came back for Ryan Giggs for the last few games to try to help out but I’m not waiting for a phonecall and don’t expect to be at Old Trafford next season.'

Following the appointment of Van Gaal on Monday, former Old Trafford midfielder Scholes believes the Dutchman has what it takes to turn the club's fortunes around provided the club back him financially in this summer's transfer window.

'Louis van Gaal has the credentials. He’s been at the biggest clubs in the world but he has a major job on his hands at Man United,' he added.

'It’s a massive task and there’s a big gap to fill to catch Manchester City, Chelsea and Liverpool next season. United are a long way behind. If van Gaal gets them to the Champions League, it’ll be a start.'
