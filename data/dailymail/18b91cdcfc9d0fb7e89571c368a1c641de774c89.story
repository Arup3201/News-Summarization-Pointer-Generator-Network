Jeremy Hunt was fighting to keep his job today but it appears he has cycled himself into even more trouble by breaking the law three times and risking £3,000 in police fines during one short bike ride.  

In just 13 minutes and two miles of peddling the beleaguered Culture Secretary was snapped riding through a red traffic light and twice down one-way streets as he wobbled home from work on his bike.

Dressed in jeans and a casual shirt, he was not only flouting the highway code but also acting illegally, with each offence carrying a maximum penalty of £1,000.

And to top it off he wasn't wearing a helmet, which is not against the law, but will anger safety campaigners.

No stopping him: Jeremy Hunt simply ignores the red traffic light and rides off on his merry way

Still going: He doesn't stop to look for traffic and just ploughs on across a Westminster street

Roger Geffen, of the National Cyclists' Organistation told the Mirror: 'All road users should respect the rules - and ministers, especially, should set an example.'

The exercise fanatic, who is also known to be a keen runner, was sweating for another reason today as he was today grilled at the Leveson Inquiry over his handling of Rupert Murdoch News Corp's £8 billion takeover bid of BSkyB.

He is battling to keep his job because he is 
accused of being 'too cosy' with the Murdoch empire and urging David 
Cameron not to block the deal despite needing to be independent.

No entry: The beleaguered Culture Secretary next takes his journey the wrong way up a one-way street, which is also illegal

And another: He also travels through another no entry sign as he travels back from the office

And his law-breaking cycle ride started on Sunday at around 7pm just after he left work near Downing Street for his plush London home in Pimlico.

By 7.10pm he approached a red light and despite a queue of traffic at the T-junction he followed two other cyclists through it.

Two minutes later he flew down a one 
way street, and then at 7.15pm ignored another stop sign before arriving
home and chaining up his bike.

One witness told the Mirror: 'He didn't seem to care about the rules, 
but it's not fair on other people. He could have caused an accident.'

Nearly there: Mr Hunt arrives at his home after the two-mile journey unaware he has been spotted breaking the law
