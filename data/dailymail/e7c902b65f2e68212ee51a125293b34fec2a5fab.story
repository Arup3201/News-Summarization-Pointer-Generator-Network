Sportsmail brings you the second column from Formula One star Nico Rosberg. The Mercedes driver looks back at his victory in Australia and ahead to this weekend's Malaysian Grand Prix.

My victory at the Australian Grand Prix was a special moment for the team. For us all to be together – and I was with my fiancée Vivian, too – it was great. But we didn't really celebrate too much because it should only be the beginning. 

We swiftly turned our attention and focus to the next race here in Malaysia, which shows that maturity is a huge strength within the team. In fact 'mature' is probably the best word to describe us at the moment. We have grown as a team and our time will come very, very soon where we will be winning more races – already to have success is a huge thing for us.

After the race, I went to Bali on holiday with my fiancée and some friends, which was very nice, but throughout the trip, I remained in close contact with the team because there was so much that we learned from Melbourne, and subsequently there was so much information to go through – even while I was on holiday!

Despite winning by almost 25 seconds, my victory in Australia was not as straightforward as it appeared. There were various issues that we had to deal with. The tyres, for example, were right on the edge of being too cold, so I had to keep the pace up all the time to ensure they stayed at the right temperature.

Of course, pre-season testing had gone well so we expected to look good in Australia, but to have such an advantage was still a surprise. Understandably, I was very happy with that.

I'll drink to that: Rosberg toasts with Daniel Ricciardo - the Red Bull man was later disqualified from the race

In Melbourne, we had the fastest car, but we must be careful because Malaysia is a totally different story, so we must keep an open mind. However, it is possible that we can do really well here, too. 

Daniel Ricciardo was disqualified from 
the Australian Grand Prix. I don't wish to comment on the details because I don't have all the information, but it was definitely a big pity 
because he is Australian and to have an Aussie on the podium was a great
 thing for the home crowd.

There have been lots of comments about the new sound of Formula One. The thing with this sport is that we always tend to focus on the negatives, but there are so many more positives this year.

The power units are much more contemporary and fuel efficient. The pack has also been shuffled around so there isn't always the same winner and that is very good for Formula One.  

I can understand people's views about the noise. It isn't the same as with the V8 engines, but let's focus on the positives. We are going to have some good racing for sure, and the cars are really exciting to drive and watch, from what I saw after the race. We shouldn’t rush into anything but take our time and see how things unfold over the next races.

I have been in Kuala Lumpur since Sunday. Petronas are the team's biggest partner, so I have been representing them and doing a lot of PR.

We have done a lot of interesting things, like diving with sharks for instance, and it is great to do different activities, but the main thing is the Malaysian people are backing us and they are really enthusiastic about our team which is excellent to see.

It has obviously been a very difficult week for Malaysia with the focus on the tragic events of flight MH370, and my thoughts and sympathies go to all the families and friends who have been affected. I only hope that, with the race this weekend, we can help to focus a more positive light on Malaysia and its wonderful people.

The Malaysian Grand Prix is one of the toughest on the calendar because of the intense heat and humidity, so you have to be very fit. I try and acclimatise to the conditions by staying outside as much as possible and doing sport outdoors.

It is vital to stay hydrated, too. In fact, I am drinking right now because during the race I can sweat up to four litres which is massive and probably double the amount of a regular race.

The race will be very demanding. By the end of the grand prix, your concentration levels will not be as high as they were at the beginning nor my fitness which will have reduced, too.

No hard feelings: Lewis Hamilton (left) and Rosberg shake hands after last year's Malaysian Grand Prix

At last year's Malaysian Grand Prix, I was asked to 'hold station' behind my team-mate Lewis Hamilton, but I don't want to go into that because it is history. 

What I can say is that this year we will give you some exciting racing because that is what Mercedes is here to do. We want to entertain and put on a good show.

At the same time there will be circumstances where we as drivers have to put the team first, and they have already been discussed so everything is clear.

Closed chapter: Rosberg says his incident with Hamilton at last year's race has been consigned to history

Bayern Munich won the Bundesliga title earlier this week which is an amazing achievement. I am very happy about it. They were rewarded with the Laureus Team of the Year award on Wednesday night which was great to see because they fully deserve it.

I was at the ceremony because it was held here in Kuala Lumpur, and I am an ambassador, so it was nice to be there. 

We face Manchester United in the Champions League next week which could be very exciting. United aren't at the top of their game at the moment so hopefully we will beat them, and I am confident that we can.
