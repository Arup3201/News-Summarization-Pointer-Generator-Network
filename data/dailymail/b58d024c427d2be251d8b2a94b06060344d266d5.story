Russia is in danger of losing the 2018 World Cup due to the country's military action in Ukraine. 

The country may also be banned from hosting Formula One races and its football clubs expelled from the Champions League and Europa League.

‘Beside economic measures, thought could be given to taking coordinated action within the G7 and beyond to recommend suspension of Russian participation in high profile international cultural, economic or sports events (Formula One races, UEFA football competitions, 2018 World Cup etc),’ according to leaked European Union documents seen by  the Telegraph newspaper.
