Disgraced San Diego Mayor Bob Filner may be considering a deal with his attorneys that would force him to resign, the local ABC News affiliate is reporting.

Two sources told ABC 10 News that Filner's attorneys were in a mediation session Monday morning with City Attorney Jan Goldsmith and Gloria Allred, who is representing some of the women who have made sexual harassment claims against Filner.

A retired federal judge is reportedly presiding over the mediation, which includes a review of a potential resignation deal, according to the station's sources.

'The meeting was at an undisclosed location, but Team 10 discovered Filner entered 101 West Broadway Monday morning,' the station reported. 'Sources said the mayor was on the 15th floor, where the U.S. Attorneys office is located. However, it was not clear if that was where the mediation was to be held.'

The meeting was reportedly held as Filner was set to return to City Hall after undergoing a two-week program for behavioral counseling.

Over the last month, 16 women - including a university dean and a retired Navy rear
admiral - have gone public with accusations that he sexually harassed 
them. Many claim that he cornered them, groped them and slobbered them with kisses.

Over
the weekend, demonstrators demanding that the embattled mayor step down 
from his position marched with posters that read, 'Filner: Resign or 
Recall!'

The protestors are also collecting signatures that they hope will lead 
to the recall of Filner - they need to get more than 101,000 by September 26

As
part of the recall effort, protesters - including attorney Gloria 
Allred and some of the women accusing Filner - rallied at City Hall on 
Sunday, Day 1 of the official recall effort.

'There is no excuse for abuse and there is no excuse for you to stay in power,' Allred told the crowd.

She was joined by one of her clients, 67-year-old Peggy Shannon, a volunteer city worker who assists senior citizens and the latest person to accuse Filner of sexual harassment.

On Thursday Shannon revealed that
Filner had repeatedly asked her out during work and that he once 
grabbed her and kissed her on the lips.

Shannon claims that Filner, 70, also once told her that he could 'go eight hours straight' in an apparent reference to sex.

Filner's
former communications director, Irene McCormack Jackson, filed a 
lawsuit claiming that he asked her to work without panties, demanded 
kisses, told her he wanted to see her naked and dragged her in a 
headlock while whispering in her ear.

Filner, a Democrat, returns to louder calls for his resignation, and an even stronger fight to boot him out if he does not step down.

While he was undergoing therapy, more women went public with lurid claims. He also returns to investigations over his handling of city finances, including questions over a trip to Paris.

Even the local Hooters restaurants have posted signs saying he is not welcome there.

The
feisty liberal - who served 10 terms in Congress - has long had a 
reputation for berating employees and has been dogged by rumors of 
making sexual advances on women, but critics say it's uncertain how he 
can survive the onslaught of accusations that have come out every few 
days over the past month and a half.

‘He
is a ferocious campaigner, but this will be most difficult campaign of 
his life,’ said Steve Erie, a political science professor at the 
University of California, San Diego.

‘This is a monumental hill that he has to surmount. The allegations are like Chinese water torture, the way they keep coming out. It's like drip, drip, drip. At this point, I'm waiting for first woman who has been around Bob to say “he didn't manhandle me.'"

The 70-year-old has become a punch line for comedians and regularly mocked on national programs such as ‘The Daily Show.’

U-T TV, a local news station in San Diego, has called for Mayor Bob Filner to resign in a controversial music video parody of pop artist Robin Thicke's 'Blurred Lines'

A cable television affiliate of the 
local newspaper, U-T San Diego, recently produced its own musical parody
of Robin Thicke's 'Blurred Lines' that shows a man's body with Filner's
face superimposed on it hip-thrusting and chasing women in short skirts
and high heels.

The video by U-T TV was criticized for making light of a serious situation.

Before going into therapy, Filner asked voters to be patient while he gets help.

‘Before I even think of asking for forgiveness, I must demonstrate that my behavior has changed. And that will only happen over time and only if such incidents never, ever happen again,’ Filner said.

He vowed when he returned that his ‘focus will be on making sure that I am doing right by the city in terms of being the best mayor I can be, and the best person I must be.’

Filner has agreed not to meet with women alone on city business and has delegated broad authority to a new interim chief operating officer, Walt Ekard, a highly regarded former county administrator.
