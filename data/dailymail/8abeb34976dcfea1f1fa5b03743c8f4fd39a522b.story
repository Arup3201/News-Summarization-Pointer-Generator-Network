Diego Maradona slapped a journalist after he allegedly winked at his ex-girlfriend Veronica Ojeda.

The Argentina legend was filmed stepping out of a car and angrily approaching the reporter in Buenos Aires.

He slaps the man and calls him an ‘idiot’ in front of a hoard of fans and camera crews who were celebrating a Children’s Day event in the capital on Saturday.

Maradona, 53, was captured on camera by crews as he approached the journalist and slapped him on face

Reports say the man winked at his ex-partner and mother of his son, leading the former football star to say: 'What's up fool? Why mess with my wife if I do not mess with you?'

The 53-year-old then gets back in his car, with his children in the back, and drives off.

Maradona had been telling reporters he was celebrating a day with his son before the slap: 'This is a gift for my child. One of the first days I have spent with my son.

'I have a happy environment so stop breaking balls, because I am 53 years old and I'm not the "Dieguito", my name is Diego Armando Maradona!'

His latest spat has made headlines in Argentine newspapers after the clip appeared online - and gave a whole new meaning to the Hand of God.

He first made the saying famous after he was said to have used his hand to score a goal in the 1986 World Cup, knocking England out.

And it is not the first time he stirred up a frenzy with the press when he was given a suspended sentence in 1998 for shooting journalists with an air rifle.

He was reportedly enjoying a Children's Day event with his son in Buenos Aires when the incident happened 

Reports say the man winked at his ex-partner and mother of his son Veronica Ojeda, which sparked the attack
