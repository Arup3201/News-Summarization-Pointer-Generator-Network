If you’re looking for your next must-have ‘glamping’ accessory – then this Pelty bluetooth speaker could be it.

Not only does it provide ambient lighting, but it can also play your favourite tunes using nothing but the power of a candle.

The Pelty gets its name from something known as the ‘Peltier effect’, the physical process that powers the speaker.

If you’re looking for your next must-have ‘glamping’ accessory – then this Pelty bluetooth speaker could be it. Not only does it provide ambient lighting, but it can also play your favourite tunes using nothing but the power of a candle

The Pelty gets its name from something known as the ‘Peltier effect’, the physical process that powers the speaker.

The phenomenon describes the temperature difference created by applying a voltage between two electrodes connected to a semiconductor material.

On the Pelty, the effect provides power using a thermoelectric effect, where a voltage is produced using a device with contrasting temperatures. 

This is a thermoelectric effect where a voltage is produced using a device with contrasting temperatures. No batteries or charging cables are required.

Noise from the speaker will last as long as the candle, and a user can switch it off by blowing out the flame.

Milan-based inventor, Gianluca Gamba, came up with the idea for the device as he was organising a dinner on his terrace for his fiancée.

He needed some music to create the right mood, but he realised his traditional bluetooth speaker wasn't appropriate for the occasion.

What he came up with, instead, was a design that was made from ceramic, wood, and glass.

According to Gamba, the system can connect to a musical player within a few seconds of the candle being lit.

The designers claim a typical candle can last up to five hours and the loudness of the system is comparable to any other docking station.

The Pelty is currently trying to attract funds via Indiegogo and is aiming for a $100,000 (£58,900) goal.

The regular pledge price for a Pelty is $269 (£158) but an early pledge of at least $199 (£117) will secure you a model.
