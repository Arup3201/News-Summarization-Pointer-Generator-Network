Four years ago, Dan Black was paralysed in a cycling accident. Ever since, he has been raising money for pioneering stem cell treatment which could one day help him walk again.

But now, after collecting £20,000, the  25-year-old has given it all away – so a little boy can learn to walk instead.

Mr Black abandoned his own dream after hearing about five-year-old Brecon Vaughan, who lives near him just outside Chepstow, in South Wales.

Brecon was born with rare spastic diplegia cerebral palsy which causes stiffness in his legs, poor balance and coordination.

He has to use a walking frame to get 
around, and his family are desperately trying to raise £60,000 for an 
operation in America to help him walk unaided for the first time.

Mr Black, who is wheelchair-bound, 
said he made the extraordinary gesture because Brecon had a better 
chance of walking than he does.

‘I know for me that things aren’t 
going to get better any time soon,’ he said. ‘I just wanted to do 
something that could help someone whose life could get better.

‘Brecon can definitely walk if he has 
the surgery. I wouldn’t wish being paralysed on anyone, so if I can help
 someone walk, I will.’

Dan Black (pictured before his accident) was paralysed from the chest down when he was knocked off his bicycle in 2009. He also suffered a stroke which denied him use of one arm

Mr Black raised £20,000 to pay for stem cell treatment but he then gave all of the money to Brecon Vaughan (pictured with his parents Ann and Rob) who has cerebral palsy

He continued: ‘While there is hope for Brecon, I will do everything I can, because I don’t want to see a young boy suffer.

‘I’m incredibly grateful to everyone who has helped me out but this boy needs it more than I do at the moment.

‘It would make me very happy to see 
the difference made to Brecon’s life. I just hope when I give the money 
it encourages others to [give].’

The treatment Mr Black was hoping to 
get is in development. While there has been progress in trials abroad, 
it would be at least five years before he could be helped.

Mr Black was knocked off his bike by a car in 2009, as he cycled to work at Tesco.

He broke a vertebrae which left him 
paralysed from the chest down. He also suffered a stroke as he recovered
 in hospital, which left him without the use of his right arm.

He requires 24-hour care at his home in Llanvair Discoed, near Chepstow, which costs £180,000 a year.

The family will use the money to pay for Brecon to have surgery in the U.S. The treatment should allow him to take his first unaided steps and to run around with his friends

Mr Black (pictured before his accident) says that he made the decision because the surgery will make more difference to Brecon that stem cell treatment would to him

Mr Black (pictured before his accident) needs round-the-clock care and knows that stem cell treatment is his only hope of walking. Even if it could help him, he would not be able to have treatment for five years

Brecon was born with two dislocated 
hips. He was put in a pelvic harness at five days old, and had had three
 operations by the time he was 13 months.

Mr Black's mother, Michaela, said: 'That little boy needs to be out playing football with his friends in the sunshine, not at home asking his mummy why he can't. I'm so proud of Daniel'

His family, from the nearby village of
 Mathern, are desperately trying to find £60,000 to send him to America 
for a procedure called selective dorsal rhizotomy.  

His mother Ann Drewery, 44, described 
Mr Black’s £20,000 gift as ‘phenomenal’. The family had already raised 
just over £11,000, so they now have more than half of the £60,000.

She said: ‘What Dan has done is brilliant. So many people have helped Brecon and we are grateful to them all.’

Brecon’s father Rob Vaughan, also 44, 
added: ‘Dan has given us a phenomenal amount of money. I don’t think it 
is even possible to say how grateful we are, or to put into words what 
it means.

‘It is incredible. How do you even start saying thank you for something like that?’

Yesterday Mr Black’s mother Michaela 
said: ‘It’s heartwarming what Daniel has done. It’s crazy that that 
young lad Brecon could be able to walk, if he had the money.

‘Daniel can’t walk, not right now, and
 he accepts that. That little boy needs to be out playing football with 
his friends in the sunshine, not at home asking his mummy why he can’t. 
I’m so proud of Daniel.’

Selective dorsal rhizotomy is a neurosurgical technique used to treat spasticity (increased muscle tone) in the lower limbs.

The lower vertebrae are opened to reveal the spinal cord which contain the neurones of the central nervous system. These neurones (bundles of nerve fibres) channel messages between the brain and different areas of the body.

Electrical stimulation is used to identify and sub-divide sensory and motor nerves.

This process continues until the specific nerves and nerve roots affecting the spastic muscles and which may not be 'transmitting' properly are identified and cut.

Due to the size of the nerves and rootlets, this is a very precise procedure and therefore the surgery can last several hours and requires a general anaesthetic.

Many months of physiotherapy are needed after the surgery to retrain the legs.
