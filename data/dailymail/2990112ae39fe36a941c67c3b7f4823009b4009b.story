Man who would be President: Texas Senator Ted Cruz will reportedly announce his bid on Monday

Ted Cruz will reportedly announce his intention to run for President of the United States this Monday, which would make him the first officially declared hopeful in the 2016 election.

The Texas Republican senator, who is still in his first term of Congress, is due to commit himself to a presidential campaign at a speech in Virginia next week, according to senior advisers.

Aides in the Cruz camp spoke about his intentions to the Houston Chronicle, but insisted on remaining anonymous.

Cruz will hope to triumph against other GOP front-runners such as Jeb Bush, Scott Walker and Rand Paul to win his party's nomination.

The Chronicle reported that Cruz will announce at a convocation ceremony held at Liberty University, Virginia, the world's largest Christian university.

Sketching out his campaign strategy, Cruz aides said he will hope to raise more than $40million to help him compete in the primary campaign.

Cruz is said to be skipping the step of forming an 'exploratory committee', which Jeb Bush has already taken, and will directly announce the bid. 

He will hope that his conservative credentials will play well with the Tea Party wing of the GOP, and also rely on scooping up second and third-preference votes from less convinced voters.

Though he lacks the clout of other candidates within Washington and the political establishment, strategists admit, they hope that with the voters of key states like Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, he will be able to carry the day nonetheless.

However, Cruz remains an outlier in a busy Republican field. A poll earlier this month, from Quinnipiac University, gave him 6 per cent of the GOP vote.

Men to beat: Jeb Bush, left, and Scott Walker, right, both command more GOP support than Cruz. Bush has formed an 'exploratory committee' for his bid, while Walker has yet to announce

In comparison, Wisconsin governor Scott Walker took 18 per cent, former Florida governor Jeb Bush won 16, with three other hopefuls still polling better than Cruz.

However wins the Republican nomination will still have to win out against the Democratic contender, most likely Hillary Clinton, to take the White House next year.

Nobody else has outright declared an intention to run yet. However, MSNBC reported last week that Rand Paul is planning to announce on April 7.

The Kentucky senator will reportedly make the direct announcement is Louisville, which would give Cruz a two-week head start.
