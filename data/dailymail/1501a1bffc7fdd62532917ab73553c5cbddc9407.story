David Cameron is to unveil a new generation of apprenticeships to make vocational training more academically challenging for youngsters.

The Prime Minister was due to visit the Mini factory in Oxford today to announce the 100,000 vocational training schemes for young people over the next two years.

In the future, apprenticeships will last at least a year and will be based on standards designed by employers, to meet the specific needs of their industry. The apprentices will also leave with the knowledge to be fully competent in an occupation.

But apprentices will also be subjected to more thorough academic assessments - including English and maths tests.

At least 20 per cent of their training will take place away from their work stations. Downing Street said it was intended that all new apprenticeships will meet the new standards by 2017/18.

The new scheme has been developed in response to last November’s report by entrepreneur Doug Richard, which called for higher quality training and more educational rigour to give apprenticeships ‘serious kudos’ with both employers and employees.

More than 60 companies - including Mini owners BMW, BAE Systems, Microsoft and Barclays Bank - have signed up to be ‘trailblazers’ for the new-style apprenticeships.

Mr Cameron is expected to say: ‘I said earlier this month that I want us to deal with the scourge of youth unemployment by giving young people more chances and choices in life. This goes to the heart of my vision for this country: backing hard working people who want to get on in life and making sure Britain competes and thrives in the global race.’

He will add: ‘If you want an apprenticeship, we’re going to make sure you do the best apprenticeship in the world. The reforms we’re announcing today will put employers in the driving seat and ensure that we deliver high quality training that supports you and our economy for years to come. And as the range of companies signed up today shows, these are apprenticeships in different industries and sectors meaning people have a real choice about the career they want and our economy is balanced.’

Mr Cameron will also say: ‘If you need help preparing for an apprenticeship or want to get straight into the world of work, we’ll help you too. We’ve been talking to some of the biggest companies in Britain, massive global brands where young people have a real opportunity to progress up the ladder, and they have said they want to offer 100,000 vocational training schemes for young people.’

The Prime Minister will concede that the new apprenticeships are not a cure-all and will not ‘abolish youth unemployment overnight’. ‘But this is a massive step forward for young people and for our country.’

New vocational training schemes are being pledged by Accenture, BAE Systems, Barclays, BT, Centrica, Diageo, GSK, HSBC, Kingfisher, M&S, National Grid, Tesco, Unilever, and WPP, and will include intensive vocational training, mentoring and on-the-job experience.

The scheme is being modelled on those run by the Prince’s Trust.

A spokesman from The Prince’s Trust said: ‘Too many young people are facing long-term unemployment, believing their destiny lies in the dole queue. Prince’s Trust programmes are proven to help unemployed young people into jobs. Now, this backing from some of Britain’s biggest businesses will support thousands more disadvantaged young people into work.’
