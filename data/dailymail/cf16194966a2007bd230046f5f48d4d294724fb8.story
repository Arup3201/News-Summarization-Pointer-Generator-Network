A young boy died from an asthma attack after a 'tragic' blunder from a 999 call handler led to the ambulance arriving 23 minutes after the emergency call was made.

Eight-year-old Clayton Barker, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, started struggling for breath while enjoying a sleepover at his grandmother's house in March last year, an inquest heard.

But when his grandmother Elaine Barker phoned 999, the operator thought the emergency was less serious than it was.

It meant the next waiting ambulance was 
sent to another emergency instead - and Clayton was not reached by 
paramedics until 23 minutes after the call.

The young boy was eventually taken to hospital by ambulance staff, but was pronounced dead on arrival. Tests showed he died of an acute asthmatic attack.

The tragedy - described as a 'subconscious and isolated mistake' - unfolded when the call handler asked a scripted question, but took the wrong answer, the inquest at Heywood Magistrates' Court was told.

The call operator - who had taken nearly 80 calls during the 12-hour shift - asked Clayton's grandmother: 'Is he having any difficulty speaking through breaths?'.

But when the operator heard Clayton mutter something in the background, she wrongly registered the answer as 'no' instead of 'yes'.

It meant Clayton's situation was thought to be less urgent than it was - leading to a 13-minute delay in the ambulance arriving. 

If the ambulance had been sent the first time, it could have arrived at Clayton's grandmother's within six minutes - at 7.27pm - from a station located just six miles away, the inquest was told.

'Full of life': Clayton, who had suffered with the condition since he was five, was said to be 'mischievous' and 'full of energy and life'

Young Clayton, described by his mother as 'full of life and energy' was not reached by paramedics until 23 minutes after the 999 call. He was taken to hospital but pronounced dead on arrival

But, after the call was labelled as 'green' rather than a life-threatening 'red', the ambulance was not sent as a priority.

Instead, an ambulance was not sent until 7.29pm, from a station 11 miles away. It meant the ambulance arrived for Clayton at 7.40pm - 13 minutes after the first ambulance could have arrived.

The inquest has been adjourned until June for an expert witness to be called to establish whether the time difference could have made a difference to Clayton's life being saved.

Clayton, one of three brothers, had been diagnosed with asthma when he was five, the inquest was told.

Attacks could be triggered by being 
exposed to cat and dog fur and hot summer weather.

Clayton had often 
been admitted to hospital due to asthma attacks, including that same week.

Clayton was enjoying a sleepover at his grandmother's house when he started 'wheezing', the inquest at Heywood Coroners' Court was told

Bur four days later, Clayton was at a sleepover at his grandmother's home in Derker, Oldham, when he started wheezing heavily.

His mother Gemma Barker, 31, who described her son as 'mischievous and full of life and energy', told the inquest her son had played outside after school.

But she'd received a worried phone call from her mother just after 7.15pm.

Ms Barker said:
 'She said Clayton was wheezing. I thought he was okay but I could hear 
him in the background. I told her to give him his inhaler.

'Whilst on the phone I could hear 
Clayton panicking. I could tell by the tone of his voice. I told her I 
would come back and that she should ring the ambulance.'

His mother Miss Barker, pictured here, rushed to his grandmother's house by taxi. She said her son was running around trying to catch his breath and she'd never seen him in such a state before

While Clayton's grandmother rang 999, Ms Barker phoned a taxi who took her to the house.

When she 
arrived at the house, and there was no ambulance in sight, she assumed 
Clayton had already been taken to hospital, she told the inquest.

But then she saw Clayton running out of the house, wheezing.

She said: 'He
 was running around the garden, he was trying to get his breath back. He
 was leaning back. I had never seen him in such a state before.

'He collapsed as I was holding him. I
 was lifting him up off the ground, carrying him like a baby to get him 
to the taxi. His eyes just shut and he stopped breathing and he was 
limp.'

The inquest heard the 999 operator had wrongly thought the young boy was not struggling to breathe. It meant the next available ambulance - which would have arrived at the home 13 minutes earlier - was sent elsewhere instead

Clayton's grandmother made a second 999 call to find out the whereabouts of the ambulance. Meanwhile, the taxi driver attempted to give Clayton CPR.

An ambulance eventually arrived at 7.40pm and left the house at 7.56pm, the inquest heard.

It arrived at Royal Oldham Hospital at 8.02pm, but the boy was pronounced dead on arrival.

Angela Lee, assistant service manager at the emergency centre of North West Ambulance Service, said inquiries showed the call handler had made an error while asking a series of scripted questions.

Mrs Lee said: 'We went through the call. The caller heard him in the background. She asked ‘is he having any difficulty speaking through breaths?’

'The caller said she heard the child speak in the background and in her subconsciousness clicked ‘no’ when it was ‘yes’. We have talked about valuing the integrity of the caller. It is a human error.'

Due to the mistake, Clayton's attack was coded as 'green' instead of the more serious 'red'.

Mrs Lee explained life-threatening conditions were categorised as Red 1 and Red 2, which means the ambulance service respond in eight minutes.

Green 1 and 2 are to be responded to in 20 minutes and Green 3 within 60 minutes, she said.

The inquest, heard at Heywood Coroners' Court, has been adjourned so an expert witness can be called. The coroner wants the expert to shed light on whether the delay in the ambulance arrival had a significant impact on Clayton's death

She said: 'The first call received by the emergency operator was at 7.17pm on March 14. It was given a green 1 response. The call for Clayton was green and should have been code red.'

Due to the coding of Clayton’s case, the next available vehicle was sent to the home of a two-year-old toddler instead, the court was told.

The ambulance which was eventually sent to the Barker house was dispatched from Ashton-under-Lyne, 11 miles away. That first ambulance was stationed just six miles away.

Mrs Lee said: 'That evening was extremely busy. There was a huge influx of emergency calls after 6.05pm. 51 calls were sending.

'At 7pm there were 58 incidents still waiting. We had to instigate calling back emergency calls. It shows the significant demand that evening.

'The call taker has had a period of reflective action which has meant she has reflected on the on the call itself.

'She listened to it to see what went wrong. We have also issued a bulletin to staff of NWAS about the importance of recording information accurately given by the caller.'

Representing NWAS, lawyer Mr James Down: 'It is an isolated error by a person. It is human error, a tragic mistake.'

Coroner Simon Nelson said: 'Mrs Barker you have shown great dignity by your presence here today.'You will remember with great affection all the great traits Clayton clearly had in his character.

'I also commend Mrs Lee for coming forward and giving the evidence as she has done so.'
