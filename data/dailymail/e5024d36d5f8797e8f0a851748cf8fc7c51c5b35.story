The
state-backed Royal Bank of Scotland is under fire for lavishing 
hundreds of thousands of pounds on corporate hospitality at Wimbledon.

Staff
and guests of the bank, bailed out with billions of pounds of 
taxpayers’ cash, will enjoy the run of plush ‘Suite H’ overlooking the 
famous No 1 Court throughout the tournament.

They
will be able to watch the top matches from the best seats at the All 
England Club’s show courts, and dine on gourmet food such as lobster, 
gammon and Gressingham duck.

A free bar will serve champagne
cocktails, and other delicacies will include Vale of Evesham asparagus,
slices of a £50 pork and sage pie with pickle and tasty British 
cheeses. 

Other companies using the tournament to entertain clients include the BBC, oil giant BP and Barclays Bank.

RBS,
which was taken to the brink of collapse by former boss Fred Goodwin, 
was saved by a Treasury bailout in 2008. The Government now has an 81 
per cent shareholding. 

The
bank axed 15,000 jobs and pledged to cut corporate hospitality, but 
continues to sponsor Britain’s No 1 tennis player, Andy Murray.

Bailed out: The Government has an 81 per cent shareholding in the bank which has recently axed 15,000 jobs

It is 
thought that RBS is paying about £260,000 for its suite at Wimbledon.

News
of its extravagance was met with disbelief last night.Matthew Sinclair,
chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘It is outrageous 
that hard-pressed families are still paying the price for propping up 
the banks yet RBS can afford to wine and dine clients.’

An
RBS spokesman said that as well as entertaining, the bank used 
Wimbledon to promote an initiative to help foster children’s sport.
