Minnesota United were officially confirmed as the next Major League Soccer expansion team on Wednesday.

Minnesota, who have competed in the second-tier North American Soccer League since 2010, will make their MLS debut starting with the 2018 season.

Coupled with already-announced expansion plans for Atlanta and the recreation of the team formerly known as Chivas USA in Los Angeles, Minnesota United will be the 23rd franchise in MLS.

'We have a plan here that we believe in,' MLS Commissioner Don Garber said during a news conference at the home of Major League Baseball's Minnesota Twins. 'A plan that we believe will take the sport to a higher level.'

MLS grew to 20 clubs this season with Orlando City and New York City FC both joining the league.

Miami is in line to become the 24th MLS franchise but the Florida team is in doubt as the would-be owners have been unable to secure a stadium deal.

Until recently, MLS had said it would stop expanding for the foreseeable future once it reached 24 teams. But last week the league said that over the course of 2015 it will evaluate further expansion beyond 24 clubs.
