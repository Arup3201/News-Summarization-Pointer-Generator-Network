Mick Schumacher, the 15-year-old son of seven-times Formula One World Champion Michael, appears primed to follow in his father's racing footsteps after he was crowned World Karting Vice-Champion on Sunday.

The Schumacher family was devastated in December of last year when Michael, who claimed 91 grands prix victories during a spectacular career, was left fighting for his life after sustaining serious brain injuries when he hit his head on rock while skiing off-piste with his son Mick in the French Alps.

The severity of the injuries left the 45-year-old German in an induced coma for six months, but earlier this month there was some encouragement for his family and army of fans after he was transferred to his family home in Lausanne, Switzerland to continue his rehabilitation.

And there was further cause for optimism over the weekend when his son Mick finished runner-up to British youngster Enaam Ahmed in the FIA's KF-Junior category at the World Championships in Essay, France.

Mick had until this year adopted the racing surname of Betsch - his mother Corinna's maiden name.

But this season he has raced under the guise of Mick Jnr and after tasting victory in four of his heats, finished six seconds adrift of Ahmed in the grand final to stand alongside the Londoner on the podium.

'Of course I am proud of such an important result,' Schumacher Jnr said before tellingly adding: 'But it is also clear that it is my goal to be world champion. This is only the beginning of my career.'

His father Schumacher broke numerous records en route to claiming seven world titles and staking his claim among the sport's all-time greats.

The German won back-to-back titles with Benetton in the mid-nineties before remarkably winning five successive championships with Ferrari at the turn of the century.

Updates on his condition since his freak skiing accident on December 29 have been sparse. And in a typically brief statement issued earlier this month, his manager Sabine Kehm warned that he faces a 'difficult road ahead' despite the encouraging news that he has been transferred to his home off the shores of Lake Geneva to continue his recovery.

'Considering the severe injuries he suffered, progress has been made in the past weeks and months,' said Kehm.

'There is still, however, a long and difficult road ahead.

'We would like extend our gratitude to the entire team at CHUV Lausanne for their thorough and competent work.

'We ask that the privacy of Michael's family continue to be respected, and that speculations about his state of health are avoided.'
