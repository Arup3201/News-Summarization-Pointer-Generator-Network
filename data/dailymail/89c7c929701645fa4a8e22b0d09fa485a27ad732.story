Spending long hours at work could lead to relationships beyond the professional kind.

With every relationship, comes a catch that could lead to a heartbreak but when it comes to office romances, it could mean tricky business.

From risking careers to a short fling at an after-work-drinks – no matter how far you go in keeping it a secret – it’s important to prepare yourself if things end on a sour note.

With Valentine’s Day fast approaching, Randstad’s group director Steve Shepherd, 49, shares his professional and personal experiences on dealing with a sticky situation and how it could turn into a long-term prospect if you play your cards right.

Steve Shepherd, from Melbourne and his wife Joanne met when they were working together 27 years ago

Be discreet. Being overly affectionate or making it too obvious in a relationship or even a fling in front of colleagues would not result in a good outcome

Do tread carefully. Always keep it at a professional level and control your behaviour. If your relationship turns soar - not only will it affect the both of you, it'll harm the rest of your office or put your career in jeopardy - so be sensible about it

Do think about the consequences. Before plunging into a relationship, you need to consider why you're doing it and whether you can both work professionally and maintain your romance outside of working hours? 

Don't involve too many people. Depending on how it goes in your relationship - only involve your colleagues when you know things are heading in the right direction 

Don't keep it a secret for too long. Most people tend to build it up inside because they think of the worst case-scenario if they tell their colleagues but most of the time - it's a positive reaction and it'll end those rumours

‘If you’re in a relationship at work – my advice is discretion,’ Mr Shepherd told Daily Mail Australia.

‘Being overly affectionate or making it obvious with actions in front of other colleagues tends to not have a good outcome.

‘And if a relationship goes soar, trying to hide your emotions could have an impact – not only yourself on terms of how you perform in the workforce but it could harm the dynamics of a team environment.'

Whether sparks fly or the chemistry is heating up, Mr Shepherd said it’s important to consider the consequences and what that potentially means for their career before starting anything serious.

‘We spend most of our waking lives at work and when you’re working at a large company and you’re single – the chances are – you’ll meet someone because it’s inevitable,' he said.

‘The real things to consider are keeping it at a professional level and control your behaviour.

‘We’re all here to do our jobs but if you get yourself into a little fling and not much is in it for either of you – don’t tell anybody. Not only will you put your career in jeopardy but it could be frowned upon.

'As long as you know what you're getting yourself into and it's not affecting your job - then it won't affect me and the rest of the office.'

The pair have been happily married since with two children after colleagues and bosses attended their big day

The 49-year-old from Melbourne met his wife Joanne at work many years ago.

‘We were working together at another organisation at the time and we got invited to a housewarming party and we started chatting there,’ Mr Shepherd said.

‘When we started dating, we kept it on the down low and at a professional level at work for a good eight to nine months.

After working for 18 months while being in a relationship, the pair got married and  Mr Shepherd said he is still happily married to his wife 27 years later.

The father of two said he is pleased to say that there was never an awkward moment or a public spat at work between himself and Joanne.

‘It was important for both of us to focus on our careers and what was more important – we made it clear that we didn’t want to damage the relationship with other colleagues,' he said.

Mr Shepherd said it’s important to consider the consequences before being involved in any office romance

‘You don’t want people around you to walk on egg shells and we both stepped back and worked as co-workers but after work, we would laugh about how we interacted at work.

‘The greatest thing for us was when we started telling people - half had already known  but joked they were waiting for the day for us to come clean and others never picked up on it.'

And would he recommend others to get romantically involved in an office romance too?

‘We’re still together 27 years later and I love my wife more each day. We have two great kids. How can I not recommend that?’ Mr Shepherd said.

‘Always tread with caution and make sure you have a great life and career – not one or the other.

'Be sensible. If you get wind up in another office fling – maybe consider having one less wine glass at the next function,’ he laughed. ‘Common sense prevails.’

Mr Shepherd is not the only person who has found love inside an office.

Andy and his wife Fiona met six years ago when they worked together at an agency company in London

Andy, who wished to not give his surname, met his wife Fiona, 34, while they were both working in the same agency company more than six years ago.

‘It was one of those situations where you’re working long hours and spending lots of time together – you just grow fond of each other,’ 33-year-old Andy told Daily Mail Australia.

‘We kept it a secret at first because we didn’t know if it would progress after a couple of dates or turn into a long term thing.

‘But overtime, we started to tell one or two people and it grew from there. It obviously got serious and people were talking about it so we came out and said we were an item.

It took the couple six months before progressing into a serious relationship but Andy admits it was quite challenging to maintain at first.

‘One thing that helped was, we worked in different teams so it’s certainly different when you’re working with each other every day,’ Andy said.

‘When we started telling people, most of the office had already known so it was the worst kept secret,’ Andy laughed.

The pair hit it off and they both shared similar interests and ambitions - they had plans to travel the world

Andy and his wife married last year in Scotland where their colleagues and bosses attended the big day

When it comes to working, it could also be a great place to meet a potential partner with similar interests and ambitions as Andy discovered they both dreamt about travelling the world.

‘Neither of us thought we’d be working together for the rest of our lives and we knew we both wanted to travel,' Andy said.

‘We moved to Australia four years ago and got married last year in Scotland [where my wife is from]. Lots of our colleagues came to the wedding as well.

‘I think if you’re serious with each other, then there is nothing to worry about starting a relationship in the workplace.

'The only negative comment I got was "you're punching above your weight",' Andy laughed.

Andy, who now lives in Sydney with his wife, said it was important to make it public to colleagues and bosses that you're in a serious relationship with another colleague because 'it’ll tear up those office rumours'.

‘A lot of people think it's a bad situation or it’s not going down well if they tell people but often what we picture in our minds would be different in reality,' Andy said.

'And in most cases, it’s actually not bad at all and you'd be surprised with the positive reaction.

'We've been happily married since and I plan to start a family with her in the future.'
