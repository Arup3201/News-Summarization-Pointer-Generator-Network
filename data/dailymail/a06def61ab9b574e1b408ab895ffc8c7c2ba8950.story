A South African monkey sanctuary is preparing for the world’s first live streamed chimpanzee birth.

Nine-year-old chimpanzee Nina is set to give birth to her first baby within the next couple of days and can already be seen 24-hours-a-day on a video feed from her quarters.

The online stream from the Jane Goodall Institute South Africa in Cape Town show Nina playing in her pen, sleeping on straw and appearing as impatient as the rest of the world watching.

Nina was rescue by in 2007 having been captured by South Sudanese wild meat hunters, who is presumed to have killed her parents.

Although the institute is a non-breeding facility it appears that Nina’s contraceptive implant failed.

The centre believe fellow rescue chimpanzee Thomas is the culprit, resulting in the exciting event which can be viewed all over the world.

Nina and Thomas came to the centre as infants alongside three other orphaned chimpanzees after authorities in South Sudan and placed in a zoo before arriving at the centre in Cape Town.

Premiere: The world's first live-streamed birth will see nine-year-old Nina welcome her first baby, and it will all be available online in real-time

Mother-to-be: Nina is nesting in her pen as the institute announces the worldwide broadcast of her giving birth within days

Rebel: The rescue chimp is believed to have fallen pregnant despite having a contraceptive implant, and it is thought her 'childhood sweetheart' is the father

The Jane Goodall Institute South Africa said: ‘We have a very strict non-breeding policy, but the implant failed and today we wait for Nina to give birth.

‘We do not know if she will accept the baby, as she herself was tragically robbed of a normal childhood in the wild with her chimpanzee family.

This is not the first time an animal birth is streamed online, just last October, South Carolina's Grenville Zoo broadcast the birth of baby giraffe Kiko to the world through an online feed.
