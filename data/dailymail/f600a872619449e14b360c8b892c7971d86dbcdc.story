Jason Lee, a managing director at Goldman Sachs, was initially arrested a month ago after the woman accused him of attacking her at a home he had rented in East Hampton with his wife

A New York City investment banker is free on bail after being arraigned on Friday on charges that he raped a woman he met at a nightclub on Long Island.

Jason Lee, a managing director at Goldman Sachs, was initially arrested a month ago after the woman accused him of attacking her in a bathroom at a home he had rented in East Hampton, a summer resort town, with his wife.

Lee, 37, left a courthouse in Riverhead after his arraignment without saying a word.

He was hand in hand with his wife Alicia who appeared strained but the couple were wearing their wedding rings.

A judge set his bail at $100,000.

Lee's lawyer, Edward Burke Jr., told reporters his client is innocent.

'We have what is a rush to arrest my client, a rush to the grand jury and a rush to indict my client,' Burke said.

'My client is adamant that he did not do this and adamant that he did not perform these serious allegations upon this complainant at all.'

When asked whether the sex between Lee and the woman was consensual, Burke said: 'Yes, it was.'

Prosecutors said Lee was celebrating his birthday at a club in Wainscott when he invited the woman and her friends back to his rental home for an alleged 'naked pool party'.

The woman said that once at the house, Lee undressed, forced his way into a bathroom and pinned her to the floor.

Suffolk County District Attorney Tom Spota said the woman was treated at a hospital following the assault.

He said she was from Ireland but was working in the U.S. at the time of the attack. She has since returned home, Spota said.

Lee,Â who is managing director of the firm's equity capital markets group, is on a leave of absence from Goldman Sachs' equity capital markets department. He lives in Manhattan.

At the time of the incident last month, police who arrived at the house reportedly found the banker cowering in his Range Rover.

It also emerged Lee's own friend, 
Rene Duncan, called the police, believing one of the alleged victim's 
friends had stolen a car from Lee's rental home.

But
when police arrived, the young woman's brother drew a female officer 
aside and led her into the house where his sobbing sister reported she 
had been raped, according to The East Hampton Star.

A
source told the newspaper that Lee then went to the driveway of the 
$33,000-a-month summer home he was renting, got into his late model 
Range Rover, which was dark with tinted windows, and hid. But officers 
soon found him cowering inside, the source said.

The
Star reported Lee and Duncan met the alleged victim, a foreign student,
and her friends at Georgica restaurant and lounge in Wainscott on 
August 19, where the two men were celebrating Lee's 37th birthday.

They
asked the group back to Lee's rental home, where the banker is accused 
of going into the house with the young woman, holding her down by the 
forearms and raping her.

One of the other foreign students 
borrowed Duncan's car to drive home another friend and did not return, 
prompting Duncan to call the cops. However, the car was found the next 
day.

If convicted, Lee will serve between five and 25 years in state prison.

Lee
had been renting the luxury Hamptons summer house with his wife, 
Alicia, according to The Star. However, she was reportedly in the city 
when the party took place.

Police allege Lee sexually assaulted 
the woman during a naked pool party at the four-bedroom rental, called 
Clover Leaf Lane house in East Hampton on Long Island, New York.

The New York Times reports the mansion was listed for $33,000 a month.

Accused: Lee is a managing director for Goldman Sachs and works at the investment bank's headquarters at 200 West Street in Lower Manhattan. He lives in TriBeCa
