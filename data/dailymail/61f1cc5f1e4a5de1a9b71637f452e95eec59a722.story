Judging by the overwhelming response to this Kickstarter campaign, it is the invention that travellers everywhere have been waiting for.

A couple from New York have invented state-of-the-art, zipperless luggage that features a sliding door, a phone charger, a digital scale and GPS tracker.

Just three days into their 59-day funding period, the Trunkster team have already raised more than $137,000 (£85,000) - far surpassing their $50,000 (£32,000) goal.

'Game-changer': A New York duo have launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund their new suitcase design

State of the art: The 'Trunkster' features a sleek zipperless sliding door that opens at the touch of a button

Gaston Blanchet and Jesse Potash, from New York, are keen travellers who set about creating their ultimate suitcase after tiring of 'brittle zippers, cumbersome flaps, flimsy handles, and unreliable wheels' on traditional luggage.

They came up with the 'game-changing' design for the sliding door on the luggage  which opens at the touch of a button.

'We're all too familiar with that frustrating moment when you realise you quickly need something out of your bag,' The Trunkster team writes on their Kickstarter page.

Charge on the go: There are a host of smart features including a removable battery pack to charge devices

'With Trunkster’s revolutionary sliding door, you no longer have to unzip your entire bag and flap it open. The rolltop door lets you instantly access your belongings in one swift motion.'

The suitcase, which comes in both checked ($600) and carry-on ($500) sizes, is made from brushed airplane grade aluminum and 100 per cent virgin polycarbonate that is durable, lightweight, and scratch resistant.

As well as the nifty sliding door, there are also a whole host of features that make this suitcase truly smart.

No more overweight fees: The handle has a built-in digital scale to weigh luggage 

Dude, where's my bag? As an optional extra, the suitcase can come with GPS tracking

There is a removable battery pack that can charge a device up to nine times, and can even be separated to be used independently of the luggage.

As an upgrade, the suitcase can also have a built-in GPS tracking system that uses the same technology as Apple's 'Find my iPhone'. 

If your luggage goes missing, it can be tracked by any connected device. This optional extra costs $40. 

Popular: Three days into the campaign, backers have pledged $137,409 - far surpassing the $50,000 goal

Big and small: The design will come in both checked ($600) and carry-on ($500) sizes

Zipperless entry - a rolltop sliding door

Removable battery and USB charger

Built-in digital scale

Complete control handle

GPS enabled as an upgrade

Five-year warranty

A side-to-side handle is designed to not infringe on the space inside the suitcase as with traditional cases. 

The built-in digital scale in the handle will make balancing the suitcase on the bathroom scales - and worse yet, being told in front of a long queue of passengers that you luggage is overweight - a thing of the past. 

The scale also converts pounds to kilograms.

Sponsors of the Kickstarter campaign will also benefit from a 'no questions asked' five-year warranty.

The estimated retail price will be $500 for the carry-on and $600 for the checked. They will be shipped worldwide.

Concept: 'With Trunkster’s revolutionary sliding door, you no longer have to unzip your entire bag'

Trunkster's Kickstarter campaign was launched on November 18, and in those three days more than 350 backers have made pledges totalling $137,409 (£87,791).

Some 125 backers have made a pledge of $205, which gets them a carry-on Trunkster in return, while 94 backers have pledged $245 to receive a checked one. 41 backers have donated $450 to get both. 

The fundraising period of their projected timeline still has 56 days left, with production to start in January, and delivery expected by August.
