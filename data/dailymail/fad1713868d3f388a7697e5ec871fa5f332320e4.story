A man who lay down on train tracks after a heavy drinking session survived with just a cut to the head when a commuter train went right over him.

William McNeil, 51, from Blackburn, stumbled onto the track outside the Lancashire town's station shortly before a Northern Rail commuter train thundered towards him at 50mph, Preston Crown Court heard.

Despite the driver slamming on the emergency brake, the train did not stop until after it had gone over McNeil, leaving the traumatised driver sure he was dead.

Astonishingly, though, the intoxicated man had survived with merely a cut to the head.  Later, when police asked him how drunk he was on a scale of one to 10, he replied: '11'.

Details of McNeil's escape emerged at court where he was jailed for 12 months after admitting obstructing an engine using the railway - an offence under the Malicious Damage Act of 1861.

The incident occurred in June after train driver James Wilding spotted McNeil staggering onto the railway line ahead of him just outside Blackburn station.

Mr Wilding sounded the horn to alert McNeil but the man - whom the court heard was drunk - ignored him, instead crossing one set of tracks before lying down in the middle of the track.

Prosecutor Robert Elias said: 'The driver tried an emergency stop but he was travelling at 50mph and he didn’t succeed in stopping when he passed over the top of the defendant.

'The driver was quite sure he had killed him and went to investigate. He found blood but no corpse.

'Investigations were made and the conductor of the train said that he had seen a man run off. His head was covered in blood and was found walking in the road nearby.'

McNeil was taken to Royal Blackburn Hospital where he was said to be 'confused.'

He was later interviewed at home at Blackburn and confessed to being drunk and was going to sleep on the tracks.

He admitted: ‘I feel sorry for the train driver'.

Mr Elias added: 'It is hard to imagine anybody putting themselves down on a track in front of a fast moving train without realising the possibility of death.'

The court heard that the trauma of what Mr Wilding had gone through was 'probably his worst nightmare' on thinking that his train had killed the man.

In mitigation defence counsel Rick Holland claimed his client was planning to take his on his own life.

But passing sentence, Judge Stuart Baker said: 'I note there is no history of of mental illness and when you were arrested by the police you were clearly under the influence.

'The explanation for your actions was to the effect of: you didn’t know why you got onto the track and that you were very heavily intoxicated.

'You put the driver in the agonising position of having to apply the brakes as fast as he could and he knew he hadn’t stopped in time.

'As far as the driver was concerned his immediate thought was that there had been a fatal accident described as being the nightmare that any train driver would suffer.

'Usually anyone who ends up under a train ends up dead'

  - ASLEF union spokesman Andy Botham

'It must have been absolutely awful for the driver to think that despite his efforts his train had killed someone who had chose to lay down on the track.'

In a statement at the time of the incident, ASLEF train drivers’ union spokesman Andy Botham said: 'It is amazing that this man survived.

'Usually anyone who ends up under a train ends up dead or with dramatically life-changing injuries. It is traumatic [for the drivers] and I don’t think people consider the consequences of their actions.'

He added: 'There are around 200 incidents on the track each year so drivers are going out there every day afraid of this happening to them.

'Many drivers have been involved in an incident then have to travel down the same stretch of track every day.'
