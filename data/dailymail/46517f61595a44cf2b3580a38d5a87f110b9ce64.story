George Clooney's mom today confirmed her son's engagement to Amal Alamuddin, saying: 'You can say I'm extremely happy, Amal's a lovely girl.'

Nina Clooney has met British barrister Amal, 36, on various occasions and told MailOnline: 'I like her very much', agreeing the striking brunette has both 'brains and beauty'.

Speaking from her home in the tiny 
village of Augusta, Kentucky, Mrs Clooney said her son first introduced 
Miss Alamuddin to his parents about a year ago - and said the clan 
bonded over their mutual interest in international affairs.

Mrs Clooney, 74, and her veteran broadcaster husband Nick, 80, 
also accompanied the Oscar winning actor, 52, and his new fiancée to a 
private White House screening of The Monuments Men with President Obama 
in February.

It was that date, revealed 
exclusively by MailOnline, that showed the world just how serious 
Clooney was about Miss Alamuddin, a human rights lawyer of high standing
 who is currently representing Wikileaks founder Julian Assange.

Miss
 Alamuddin is also an adviser to Kofi Annan, the special envoy to Syria,
 while Clooney and his activist father are known for their work trying 
to resolve the Darfur conflict .

And Mrs Clooney said: 'We weren’t at all surprised when they told us they were engaged, and we couldn’t be happier for them.

'On
 an intellectual level, they are equals. That is very important to him. 
Amal’s world couldn’t be more different from the Hollywood lifestyle.'

Asked
 if Amal is anything like the other women who have swarmed over her son 
in the past, Mrs Clooney said, 'Heavens, no! She’s a lawyer, she is 
brilliant, she is a very bright woman and at the very top of her career.

'They also share a sense of fun, a sense of humour and they are both very caring people.'

Clooney
 is understood to have proposed recently after the couple enjoyed a 
series of exotic holidays around the world during a seven-month romance. The pair were pictured yesterday enjoying a ride on the star's motorbike, with Miss Alamuddin in plum position behind him.

Today, Nick Clooney echoed his wife's sentiments, telling TMZ: 'We are thrilled...my wife and I are absolutely thrilled...we are excited for both of them. Amal is a very lovely girl.'

Miss Alamudin's law firm also congratulated her on her engagement.

A
 statement released to Reuters read: 'The barristers and staff of 
Doughty Street Chambers offer their best wishes and congratulations to 
Ms. Amal Alamuddin, a member of Chambers, and Mr. George Clooney on 
their engagement to be married.'

Barrister Geoffrey Robertson added, too, that Miss Alamuddin is a 'brilliant and passionate defender of human rights' who is respected by her colleagues. And Robin Jackson, chief executive of her law firm, told Reuters: 'She brings a bright light to everything she is involved in, and I am so delighted at her happy news.'

Clooney's relationship with Miss Alamuddin is a departure from the long list of actresses and models he has dated in the past.

Rumours of their engagement began to circulate after she was spotted several times in the last week sporting a 'huge ring'.

Entertainment Tonight reported that on Thursday, the lovers were spotted at celebrity restaurant Nobu in Malibu, California, with Clooney's friends Cindy Crawford and her husband Rande Gerber. At the dinner, Miss Alamuddin had a conspicuous ring on her left ring finger, according to an onlooker.

The same ring was seen by another diner at another LA restaurant, Craig's, on Wednesday, when the pair were understood to be celebrating their engagement.

A friend told People: 'George and Amal are trying to keep things very low-key but they also aren't really trying to hide this, it doesn't seem.

Big news? George Clooney's girlfriend Amal Alamuddin, pictured here in October, was reportedly seen by multiple people showing off a ring at Nobu in Malibu, California, on Thursday.

'I think it's like they want the people they love to know that this is real, that they plan on being together for ever.'  

Clooney was first photographed with Miss Alamuddin last October in London. 

And just hours after the small screening at the White House on Tuesday, February 18, Clooney and Miss Alamuddin were pictured standing intimately together at the Round Robin and Scotch Bar at the Willard Hotel in Washington D.C. in a group that included Clooney’s pal and co-star Matt Damon and his wife Luciana, and fellow actor and co-star Bill Murray.

An onlooker at the bar revealed: 'They looked very much together, George had his arm around her and she appeared to be a girlfriend

In March, they went to Tanzania, where they were photographed on safari, and they also visited the Seychelles.

History repeating? While known as a diehard bachelor, George has been married before briefly to actress Talia Balsam from 1989 to 1993, pictured here in 1990

Miss Alamuddin was once voted the 'hottest barrister in London' by a law blog, but her life could not be more removed from the celebrity world which Clooney inhabits.

She comes from a prominent intellectual Lebanese family who fled war-torn Beirut when she was a child and settled in a large modern house in Buckinghamshire. Her mother, Baria, was a noted beauty when she was younger – a Liz Taylor of Lebanon, by  all accounts.

Her father, Ramzi, is a retired professor of business studies at the American University of Beirut.

The family are believed to belong to the Druze religious sect, an offshoot of Islam. After leaving Oxford, where she gained a 2:1 in law, Miss Alamuddin studied at the New York University School of Law.

Now working out of London's Doughty Street Chambers, she specialises in international law, human rights, extradition and criminal law.

Asked about the engagement news yesterday, her parents' housekeeper beamed a large smile and said: 'I don't know.'  But a neighbour said: 'I'm really happy for her – who wouldn't be happy with George Clooney as their husband?'  

Yesterday, Clooney's spokesman Stan Rosenfield did not deny the engagement rumours but just said: 'I do not comment on his personal life.'

Clooney was married to actress Talia Balsam from 1989 to 1993. Since then he has said that although he is not completely closed off to the idea of another wedding, he is not the marrying type.

Last December he told Esquire: 'I haven't had aspirations in that way, ever. I was married in 1989. I wasn't very good at it.'

His previous girlfriends include British model Lisa Snowdon, former wrestler Stacy Keibler, cocktail waitress Sarah Larson, Italian actress Elisabetta Canalis and Baywatch star Krista Allen.
