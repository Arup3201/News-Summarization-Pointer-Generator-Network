An unemployed father-of-13 who was given a new supersize council home while claiming £53,000 in benefits has threatened to have another child simply to spite his critics.

Tim Fisk and partner Mandy Ball had their seven-bedroom home specially created for them by their local council in Ipswich at the taxpayers expense, by knocking their existing house into the empty one next door.

Mr Fisk, 44, revealed that he 
and Miss Ball, 41,  who between them receive £53,000 in benefits every 
year, might be having another baby when they appeared on the Channel 5 
documentary ‘Benefits Britain: Life on the Dole’ on Monday night.

The couple already live with their children Sadie, 16,
 Daniel, 14, Lauren, 13, Callum, 11, Kyle, ten, Elektra-Mae, five, 
Serenity, four, Jayden, three, Starlight, two, 14-month-old Neatheus and
 their six-month-old baby girl Sotin Tia.

Tim Fisk, an unemployed father-of-13 who was given a specially made new supersize council home while claiming £53,000 in benefits, has threatened to have another child to spite his critics

Their
 oldest daughter Charlie, 20, lives with her boyfriend and has two 
children of her own, while another daughter Ashley, 18, no longer lives 
at home.

The couple claim they have endured death threats and constant abuse since the work was approved last October.

He told crews: 'It’s got nothing to do with anyone whether I can support my kids or not. If we need support that’s why we have a social service system surely.

'What is the problem. We are a large family. We don’t bother no-one. We are entitled to live anywhere as well as anyone else is.

Mother Mandy Ball holds baby Satin-Tia. She said: 'It is irrelevant how many children I have. It is my choice to have as many children as I have'

'I ain’t going to be dictated to, nobody in their life is going to be dictated to and told how many kids you can have.

'That’s not right. It’s p****d me off so much with all the c**p people keep writing and making up, do you know what I think I’ll have another one.'

Earlier he said: 'If I had my way, no, I wouldn’t want more, I’m getting a bit old now. If Mandy had her way I think Mandy would want another one.'

But speaking about how easy it was to have children, he went on: 'You go to bed at night and it just happens doesn’t it.'

Miss Ball added: 'It is irrelevant how many children I have. It is my choice to have as many children as I have.'

Mr Fisk - a former security guard and fencing contractor -  moaned that Ipswich Borough Council had made his family stay in their home during the construction work earlier this year.

Speaking at the time of the work, he said: 'The noise is horrendous really, I would have thought they’d have moved us while they were doing the work. With the newborn baby it’s a bit much.

Miss Ball added: 'I am looking forward to it being done, but it’s just the c**p that you have to put up with while it’s being done.'

Mr Fisk said he had also been forced to set up surveillance cameras outside his home because of fears for his family’s safety.

The couple live with their children Sadie, 16, Daniel, 14, Lauren, 13, Callum, 11, Kyle, ten, Elektra-Mae, five, Serenity, four, Jayden, three, Starlight, two, 14-month-old Neatheus and their six-month-old baby girl Sotin Tia

He has also given personal cameras to his partner and children so that they can film anyone making threats towards them.

He said: 'What the hell? I have had threats saying they’re going to petrol bomb us and murder my family. I’m quite disgusted with it, to be honest.

'On the street we have had verbal abuse, people shouting out, we have had cars pull up shouting out* fingers stuck up at Mandy.'

Ipswich Borough Council had estimated that the work to knock the two council houses together would cost £6,000 - but the conversion bill rocketed to £15,000 due to the chimneys of both houses having to be removed to join the homes together.

Underpinning work was also carried out to strengthen the houses because of the partition walls being knocked through.

Some of the children on holiday in Great Yarmouth. The huge family are expected to be able to move into their large home within two months

Tim Fisk says he cannot work because he has to care for his son, who is blind in one eye and has serious learning difficulties

A wet room bathroom was also installed for the couple’s son Daniel, 14, who is blind in one eye and has serious learning difficulties.

More than 80 residents had signed a petition objecting to the pair of three bedroom homes being knocked together after the council revealed its plans last October.

One near-neighbour said there is still a lot of bad feeling around the area, from people who think they don’t deserve such a big house.

The couple have previously answered criticism about their spending by saying they were living off a compensation payout from Ipswich Hospital after Miss Ball lost a baby boy during childbirth in 2008 due to an alleged medical blunder.

Mr Fisk said: 'That is why I can afford to buy stuff for my kids. I don’t get taxpayers’ money. I am not a dole scrounger.'

Mr Fisk is unable to work as he is a full time carer to his son Daniel.

He also claimed that he was having to care constantly for his partner who has suffered from severe depression since losing her baby in 2008.

He said that she had carried on having even more babies as a way of coping with her grief.

An Ipswich Borough Council spokesman said: 'It was decided that knocking two homes into one was the most cost effective way of meeting this family’s housing needs.'
