A marketing manager who was too heartbroken to leave her dog at home every day has quit her high flying career of 20 years to open up a café for dogs.

Lisa Owen-Jones, 44, from Stoke Newington, north London, was so distraught at leaving her Wire Fox Terrier, Florence, at home that she decided to do something about it.

Earlier this year she realised her dream and opened a coffee shop catering exclusively to four-legged-friends and their owners.

Lisa Owen-Jones, 44, from north London, was so distraught at leaving her terrier Florence at home when she went to work that she quit her job - and opened Scooby's Boutique Coffee Bar, based in Muswell Hill

Scooby's Boutique Coffee Bar is based in Muswell Hill and has proved immensely popular with local dog owners.

The menu includes doggy lollypups, cheese bone biscuits, flap Jack Russels, dog-gestives and puppaccinos as well as extra special weekend treats for hounds - and Lisa's tried them all.

All dogs and humans are welcome and Lisa's over the moon that her beloved Florence can now go to work with her every day.

The former marketing manager at BBC Concert Orchestra, said: 'I love my job, I can't think of a better way to spend my time than with man's best friend.

'When I got Florence in 2012 it really was love at first sight, I even carried her round in a puppy rucksack before she could even walk.

'Florence came everywhere with me, on the tube, to the pub, I'd have a beer and Florence would have an ice cube.

Some dogs 'refuse to walk past unless they can come in for their cheese bone or dog-gestive biscuit'

'But over time I found it harder and harder leaving her to go to my day job. Florence would sit next to the door with sad eyes, I felt so guilty.

'I started thinking about ways I could spend more time with her and Scooby's was born.

'Now some of my most loyal doggy customers refuse to walk past unless they can come in for their cheese bone or dog-gestive biscuit.

'I wouldn't have my life any other way now.

'We have both a human and hounds menu and we also host birthday parties and afternoon tea, we have so much fun.

'But you don't need to have a dog to come to Scooby's, everyone's welcome. It's a place to relax, meet friends and have a nice time.'

Both humans and hounds can enjoy a nice drink and treat inside come rain or shine

Lisa has wanted a dog for more than a decade. And after being dragged to countless dog shows, her mother decided to give her the best Christmas present she could ever wish for - a wire fox terrier puppy.

The idea of Scooby's came to Lisa after she was left angered by other coffee shops turning her and her pooch away.

Lisa said: 'I was tired of waving outside coffee shops trying to get the attendant to notice us.

'I got tired of standing in the rain drinking my coffee, there was no reason why we couldn't go in we just weren't allowed.

'Now both humans and hounds can enjoy a nice drink and treat inside come rain or shine.'

Lisa had worked in classical music for over twenty years and had no experience of running a café or coffee bar before.

Lisa said: 'It's been a sharp learning curve from writing business plans, learning about coffee machines to sourcing beans.

'In the beginning I signed me and Florence up for dog training classes, I really wanted to be able to feel in control of dogs in all situations.

'We've now passed our puppy foundation, bronze and silver Kennel Club Good Citizenship tests, we will get gold one day.

'Sometimes I think I must be barking but I don't regret the career change.

'I've now tried everything off the human and hound menu, it's all healthy, so why not. Florence favourites are the dog-gestives and mine are the flap Jack Russles.

'I really do love servings my hounds and humans and I've discovered that I really do like trying to make the perfect cup of coffee and love making puppaccions for the dogs - it's very satisfying.'

Scooby's has recently started hosting events, last month Lisa held a photo-call with a pet-friendly Photo Booth to launch a competition for flea and tick protection company Frontline Spot On, which named Christine Hanson as the UK's most dedicated pet owner.

Lisa said: 'We hold all kind of different events here at Scooby's, this has been one of my favourites.

'We had a photobooth and the dogs loved dressing up more than the humans, it was a lovely afternoon.

'The most dedicated pet owners were nominated and Christie was a worthy winner.

'Every week Christie drove her dog Roxie to have chemotherapy after she was diagnosed with Lymphoma.

'Sadly in September, Roxie lost her battle and left Christie and her other pooch Copper heartbroken.

'It was an honour being involved in an event with people who adore their pets just as much as me.'
