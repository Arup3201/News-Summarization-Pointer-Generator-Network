A mandolin player, a pre-Civil War historian and a scientist investigating parasites were among the winners of MacArthur Foundation 'genius grants', announced today.

The $500,000 prizes are awarded in a process shrouded in secrecy, with recipients having no idea they have even been nominated until they get a telephone call.

Grants are paid out over five years to 23 deserving citizens across America, giving them freedom to pursue a creative vision.

Winners, who work in fields ranging from
medicine and science to the arts and journalism, do not have to report 
how they spend the money and nominators must remain anonymous. 

Mandolin player and composer Chris Thile ignored the incessant phone calls from the foundation at first, thinking they were campaign calls for the U.S. presidential election. Then he received an ominous message: 'Don't tell anyone about this call.'

His tour manager searched for the phone number online and told him, 'It appears to be from something called the MacArthur Foundation.'

'I think I must have turned white,' said Mr Thile.

The musician, who played with Nickel Creek and is now touring with Punch Brothers, said he may use the grant to fund a chamber music project for a bluegrass quintet.

Northwestern University historian Dylan C. Penningroth said he now can expand his search for court records of property owned by slaves in the pre-Civil War South.

'This grant will make it possible for me to think big, to be more ambitious about the time period I cover and the questions I'm trying to answer, like, what's the connection to the modern civil rights era?' said Mr Penningroth.

For other winners - there have been 873 so far, including this year's recipients - the grants bring prestige, opportunity and, in some cases, moments of profound reflection.

'It left me thinking about my childhood,' said Dominican-American author Junot Diaz, who wrote the Pulitzer-winning novel The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao.

'It would never have dawned on me to think such a thing was possible for me,' said Mr Diaz, reflecting on his early years in New Jersey 'struggling with poverty, struggling with English... I came from a community that was about as hard-working as you can get and yet no one saw or recognised in any way our contributions.

'I have to wonder, but for circumstances, how many other kids that I came up with are more worthy of this fellowship than me?' 

David Finkel, author and national enterprise editor for the Washington Post, said the grant will allow him to complete a story he began in his book, The Good Soldiers.

The non-fiction work recounted the experiences of a U.S. Army infantry battalion deployed to Baghdad in 2007. Mr Finkel is now following returning soldiers and their families, 'watching a lot of them sink lower and lower and try to get help and maybe not doing so well.'

Winning a MacArthur grant felt like an endorsement not only of his own work, he said, but also of the type of long-form journalism he practices, which is in jeopardy as newspapers respond to the digital age.

Other winners include An-My Le, 52, a 52-year-old photographer at Bard 
College, who approaches the subjects of war and landscape from new 
perspectives and Dr. Terry Plank, a geochemist at Columbia University who researches tectonic plate collisions.

Maurice Lim Miller has started a project called the Family Independence Initiative, which rewards self-sufficiency in low-income neighbourhoods by uniting groups of friends to help each other achieve their goals.

University of California scientist Elissa Hallem is studying how parasitic worms find hosts through their sense of smell. Her work may someday prevent parasites from harming humans and improve the efficiency of good parasites that infect crop-killing insects.

'I feel very honoured that they recognised my work in this way and are making this investment in my research,' she said, after receiving the call as she was working in the microscope room.

The other winners are African diaspora writer Dinaw Mengest, conceptual photographer Uta Barth and documentary filmmaker Natalia Almada.

Two fellow winners with more unusual jobs are Claire Chase - who engages audiences with classical music through her International Contemporary Ensemble and experimental bow-maker Benoit Rolland.

The other scientists who will receive grants are marine ecologist Dr. Nancy Rabalais, bioengineer Melody Swartz, mathematician Maria Chudnovsky, computer scientist Dr. Daniel Spielman and paediatric neurosurgeon Dr. Benjamin Warf.
