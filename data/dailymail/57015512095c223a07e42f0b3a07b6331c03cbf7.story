For years, they were the  preserve of youngsters.

But now video games are proving to be a popular tool for the older generation as they look to stay in shape.

A survey by Saga has found that one in 25 over-50s exercise using Nintendo’s Wii Fit video game.

The title is even popular among those who have long since retired, with one in 50 over-75s using the game to keep fit.

The poll of more than 10,000 older 
people found that 80 per cent were more conscious of the need to 
exercise and live a healthy lifestyle now than they were in their 
thirties.

It revealed 
that more people are putting in the hours as they get older, with a 
quarter of women saying they do more exercise now than when they were 
younger.

Almost 40 per cent of fiftysomethings 
flex their muscles for two to five hours each week – but of those aged 
between 65 and 69, the rate rises to almost half.

Wii love it: The game can tell you if you have lost weight

Wii Fit, which comes with an 
electronic ‘balance board’ to monitor the player’s weight, has even 
overtaken the perennial pensioners’ favourite, bowls, in popularity.

The video game guides players through a variety of exercises, including yoga.

Ros Altmann, Saga’s director-general, 
said: ‘It’s really beginning to dawn on the older generations that the 
retirement age is not a countdown to the nursing home, but the start of 
the 'bonus years'.

‘To make the most of the opportunities
 in work and play, they need to have a decent standard of fitness – so 
more older people are spending more time exercising.’

However, rather than using the Wii to 
ward off the ill-effects of old age or prepare for working longer, some
 of the survey participants said they decided to do more exercise in 
order to improve their sex life.

The comments follow a survey earlier 
this year which found that people in their fifties prioritise sex more 
than those in their thirties.

For fiftysomethings, sex was  the third most popular pastime, behind eating out at restaurants and gardening.

However, it was only tenth in the list for thirtysomethings, who preferred going to the gym or watching television.
