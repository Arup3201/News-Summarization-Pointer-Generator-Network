A 14-year-old boy arrested for posting a pornographic video of himself and a schoolgirl on Facebook has today been bragging about his new-found notoriety on Twitter.

The unnamed teen was pictured smirking and holding up the front page of a local newspaper which featured his story under the headline: 'School kids in sex video'.

His clip - which features a 14-year-old girl consensually performing a sex act - was said to have been in 'common circulation' among pupils before being removed.

'Proud': the unnamed 14-year-old has apparently been boasting of his actions, which involved filming a girl, 14, performing a sex act on him

Police arrested the boy and he was given a final warning for making and distributing an indecent video - which will stay on his record for six years.

Disgusted parents slammed the teen’s behaviour after the picture of him holding the Gloucester Citizen newspaper was tweeted among pupils.

He has been 'bragging' about his actions and attained 'cult status' among some male pupils, according to one parent.

The anonymous parent added: 'This incident has been the subject of much tweeting among my son’s peers.

'When it first hit Twitter a couple of weeks ago I read reams of banter between the boy and girl involved, and their friends.

'I find it hard to fathom that he was apparently allowed access to Twitter, Facebook or any other social media site to brag about his new-found "fame"'.

Viewed: Scores of children were thought to have seen the film

The parent added: 'Most - predominately girls - have posted that they are disgusted by his actions.

'Inevitably,
 however, he has also attained some kind of cult status, which, as is 
evident from the picture posted on Twitter of him holding up a copy of 
yesterday’s Citizen, he seems to be revelling in.

'Sadly, it would appear that arrest and a police warning have done nothing to teach this young man a lesson.

'I
 feel desperately sorry for the young girl involved who, according to 
her tweets, was not aware that he was filming her, or that he intended 
to put the footage on Facebook.

'This boy has humiliated her and her family on an absolutely immense scale.'

The
 boy, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, was arrested in connection with 
making and distributing an indecent video on Facebook and has been given
 a final warning by police.

It was claimed the girl in the clip is from the nearby Forest of Dean but did not attend the same school.

Pupils at St Peter's High School in Gloucestershire - which is not involved in the incident - have seen the video, warned headmaster Lawrence Montagu

As Gloucestershire Police warn, the danger of posting images and videos online is that they can then be distributed freely and without control

The video came to light after Lawrence Montagu, headteacher at St Peter’s High School, informed parents in a school newsletter.

He
 wrote: 'I am led to believe that this video involves young people from 
schools in Gloucestershire but not, I emphasise, St Peter’s.

'However,
 I know that the video has been viewed by students in St Peter’s and I 
have spoken to the school about the lack of dignity and self-respect 
people have who allow themselves to be portrayed in such a way.

'It is very sad that our young people are exposed to such pornography, but it is one of the evils of modern technology.

'We
 simply have to continue educating the young to reap the benefits that 
modern technology offers but not to fall into the trap of misusing it.'
