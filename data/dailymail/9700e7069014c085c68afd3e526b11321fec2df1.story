The world's longest commercial flight - from Singapore to Newark, New Jersey - is being cancelled, it emerged today.

Singapore Airlines has announced it will end its non-stop flight, which covered a distance of about 9,500 miles (15,300km).

A slightly shorter route between Singapore and Los Angeles, holds the record for the longest by duration, will also end. The two routes were flown on gas-guzzling Airbus A340-500s.

Axed: The trip from Los Angeles is about 1,500 miles (2,400 kilometers) shorter than the one to Newark

The airline found the only way to 
make the routes profitable was by configuring the plane with 98 business
class seats that sell for about $8,000 round trip.

Other airlines operate the same plane with about 250 seats in first, business and economy classes.

The flight from Newark, right outside New York, to Singapore takes about 18 hours.

The trip from Los Angeles is about 1,500 miles (2,400 kilometers) shorter but takes 18 hours and 30 minutes.

Headwinds
over the Pacific Ocean slow the Los Angeles flight while the Newark 
flight goes over the North Pole and can fly faster.

The
Newark flight is the longest distance flight in the world and the Los 
Angeles one holds the record for duration. The flights started in 2004.

The new titles for longest flights 
will go to a Qantas route between Sydney and Dallas - which at about 
8,500 miles (13,700 km) is the longest distance-wise - and a Delta 
flight between Johannesburg and Atlanta, which at 17 hours will hold the
title of longest duration.

Singapore Airlines is selling its five A340-500s back to Airbus as part of a deal announced Wednesday.

Singapore
is ordering five more Airbus A380s and another 20 A350s. The planes 
have a list price of $7.5billion, but airlines often negotiate steep 
discounts for large orders. Deliveries are due to begin in 2017.

Singapore
currently operates 19 A380-800 superjumbos. It already had firm orders 
in place for 20 A350s, for delivery starting in 2015.

The A340s currently used on the world's longest flights will be retired by the end of 2013.

Singapore will continue to serve New York on its existing A380 route which connects in Frankfurt.

Los Angeles has an existing A380 service via Tokyo, which will also continue.
