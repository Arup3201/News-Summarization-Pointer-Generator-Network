The level of brain injury, bleeding and damage to University of Virginia student Yeardley Love's brain was to such an extent that it could only have been caused by a powerful punch to the head, a jury heard today.

Dr Christine E. Fuller, a 
neuropathologist, testified in the trial of George Huguely V as the 
prosecution continued to build the medical case that the defendant 
killed his ex-girlfriend in one final, violent encounter on May 3, 2010.

She said the blow was delivered with such a force that it 'twisted' the blood vessels in her brain, which is what caused the brain to hemorrhage and ultimately led to her death.

The 22-year-old lay dying for two hours before her roommate returned home and found her lying face down in her underwear.

Hearing: George Huguely V's weight loss was noted from the first day he appeared in court as prosecutors draw attention to the fact he was much bigger at the time of his ex-girlfriend's death

Prosecutor Dave Chapman drew attention to the difference in size and stature between Huguely and his ex-girlfriend during the trial to highlight the line he broke her door down and shook her violently

Dr Fuller described a lesion on the lower portion of Love's brain which said was a contusion, 'a fancy name for a bruise'.

Asked what the bruise would signify, Fuller replied: 'It means there's been blunt force trauma to the head,' adding it was consistent with a head banging against a wall.

Dr Fuller also described another injury 
near the base of the brain in the vicinity of the spinal cord that would
have been caused by torque — a violent twisting.

The damage to the brain would have shut 
down Love's heart and lungs, Dr Fuller said, according to WJLA. 

She added there was no possibility that
Love's brain injuries could have happened during attempts to 
resuscitate her - as the defense have suggested.

Her testimony goes to the heart of 
the prosecution's case - that Huguely violently attacked Love, banging 
her head against the wall of her bedroom.

Huguely,
24, of Chevy Chase, Maryland, is accused of first-degree murder in the 
death of Love, his on-again, off-again girlfriend and also a former UVA 
lacrosse player.

Both were seniors. Love, who was 22, was from suburban Baltimore.

The defense, which has not presented any witnesses, has suggested Love's death was an accident, possibly related to her use of a prescription medicine for attention deficit disorder.

Huguely has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder and other charges.

During highly technical testimony on Tuesday, Dr Fuller testified she found no pre-existing problems with Love's brain.

The bruising was found on what she 
described as the underside of the temporal lobe. She said it was the 
result of the brain moving within the skull, and compared it to a 
passenger in a car that comes to an abrupt halt.

Asked
by Chapman what her conclusion would have been if she had not been 
aware of Love's autopsy, Fuller said: 'Just looking at the brain, no 
history, I would have called it trauma. No question.'

The
testimony is important because of Huguely's claims, outlined in a 
police interrogation interview hours after Love was found dead, that he 
had grabbed Love and possibly shaken her but otherwise played down their
physical encounter.

Threat: Prosecutors told the jury that Huguely 
sent Yeardley Love (centre) an email before she died saying: 'I should 
have killed you'

He claimed she had banged her head against the wall of her apartment bedroom.

On Monday, a medical examiner said 
his autopsy found evidence of suffocation, though it did not cause 
death, as well as a potentially deadly neck injury.

Evidence: A love letter written to Yeardley from Huguely was shown to the court yesterday

Dr
Michael Gormley also described a series of bruises on Love's legs, 
lower back, left forearm and hand and a small series of bruises on her 
chest, which he said could be caused by grabbing.

Love's
most severe injuries were on the right side of her face. The injuries 
included a battered right eye, bruising to her neck and under her jaw.

Police officers have testified that Huguely had bruises on his arms and legs and knuckles the morning Love's body was found.

Huguely told a police detective who 
interviewed him hours after Love's body was found that his bruised 
knuckles were the result of a lacrosse injury.

The prosecution contends Huguely went to Love's apartment after an alcohol-fueled day of golf.

He kicked a gaping hole in the door of her bedroom door when she refused to let him in, prosecutors said.

Witnesses who testified last week described their relationship as fiery and both had accused the other of infidelities.

If convicted of first-degree murder, Huguely could be sentenced to life in prison.

Talented: Yeardley was a star lacrosse 
player at the University of Virginia and was just weeks away from 
graduating when she was murdered

Yesterday a love letter written by the lacrosse player to Love was also used as evidence but was only shown to the judge, jurors and attorneys.

It was recovered from a drawer in Love's bedroom after her death.

The court heard yesterday that Huguely had scrapes and bruises all over his arms and legs when he was arrested.

Officer Jeremy Carper testified in the first-degree murder trial and identified the bruises and scrapes on Huguely's arms and legs from photographs taken following his arrest.

The lacrosse player's appearance was also highlighted yesterday, namely his considerable weight loss since he was arrested.

On trial: Huguely has pleaded not guilty to all charges against him and said to did not cause enough injury to his girlfriend to kill her but admitted 'shaking her a little'

Prosecutors were quick to point out Huguely's size in 2010 when he is accused of battering down his ex-girlfriend's door, putting in her in a choke hold and shaking her so violently she died.

Ever since the former student turned up for his first courtroom appearance, the difference in his size and stature has been noted from the burly 200-pounds-plus lacrosse player who was arrested in May 2010.

According to the Washington Post, during several days of testimony, prosecutor Dave Chapman repeatedly pointed out the difference in size between Huguely and Love at the time of her death - emphasizing Love's slim build in comparison to her ex-boyfriend's heavy, muscular build.

Yesterday he asked Officer Carper what his height and weight was and asked him to compare it with Huguely when he arrested him.

The stocky officer stood before the jury and said his height was six foot and weight about 200 pounds. He said the accused was 'maybe a little taller' and 'maybe a little heavier' than him.
