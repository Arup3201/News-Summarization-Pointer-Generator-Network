It would seem to be the perfect getaway for Downton Abbey fans wanting to sample first-hand the sumptuous aristocratic lifestyle depicted in the hit drama.

For the first time in its 172-year history, Highclere Castle, where the series is filmed, is offering guests the chance to stay the night – for £500 a time.

However, despite the wallet-busting fee, fans will not get to stay in the imposing 19th Century stately home familiar to millions of ITV viewers, but in a remote gatehouse a mile down the road.

Nor will they get to sample lavish feasts served up by obliging, well-mannered below-stairs staff in the mould of fictional butler Carson – as the accommodation is strictly self-catering.

Highclere’s owners, the Earl and Countess of Carnarvon, have built the guest quarters in London Lodge, the castle’s Georgian Grade II-listed gatehouse, perched at the top of the mile-long driveway which leads to the famous front door.

It was built by the first Earl of Carnarvon in 1793, but had been left disused for decades.

Now, after two years of restoration, it is expected to open this summer, with guests able to rent it for up to two nights.

Lady Carnarvon told The Mail on Sunday: ‘It’s a new step for me. We will welcome people from all over,  I expect. Access is going to depend on the time of year. It will be cosy, charming and unique.

Self-catered: Guests paying £500-a-night will not be treated to service like the show's stars receive from Carson, Mrs Hughes and Miss O'Brien. Their stay will be strictly self-catered, it has emerged

‘It’s exciting bringing back to life an old, sad building and again giving it purpose. It is a new departure  for us to try short lets and we hope it will amuse people.

‘I hope to suggest some walks around various paths in the estate as well as suggesting local pubs.’

The castle is already immensely popular with visitors, particularly Americans, many of whom visit Britain specially to take in the stunning grounds.

Currently there is a long waiting list to marry there, with each wedding earning the estate £15,000.

And Lady Carnarvon will, no doubt, encourage her overnight guests to head to the gift shop after they have signed the visitors’ book.

The Countess has revealed she will soon be releasing her third book about the house, a cookbook called Dining At Highclere Castle: The Real Downton Abbey. Recipes, Etiquette And Anecdotes. ‘I’m hard at work so we can rush it out for the Christmas market,’ she said.

Lady Carnarvon and her husband Geordie were burdened by the high expense of running a stately home before their friend Julian Fellowes wrote the series, with Highclere in mind, for ITV in 2010.

Reports at the time suggested £1.8 million of urgent repairs were needed to keep Highclere going after it had been ravaged by damp and rot. At least 50 rooms were uninhabitable and its stone turrets were falling into disrepair.

Lady Carnarvon added: ‘Downton has helped our marketing in an extraordinary way and has meant we have been able to tackle various projects earlier than otherwise because of the increased tours and visitors. And I suspect the effects from Downton will still roll out over the next 20 years.’
