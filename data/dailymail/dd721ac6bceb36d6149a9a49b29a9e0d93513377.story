Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini hopes Champions League opponents CSKA Moscow will learn from last season's Yaya Toure racism storm ahead of this winter's return meeting.

City midfielder Toure was racially abused by CSKA fans in last season's competition, meaning that the Russian club will play their first game this season with part of the stadium closed.

Pellegrini has outlined his hopes that there will be no repeat after City were drawn in the same group as the Moscow club once again.

City star: Yaya Toure, racially abused by CSKA Moscow supporters last year, in training on Thursday

Hands up if you're winners: Manchester City's players train at the Etihad Stadium

'I remember well what happened last year,' said Pellegrini. I hope for CSKA it is a lesson they have learned.'

City have once again been drawn in a tough group in the Champions League, with Bayern Munich and Roma also in the section.

Pellegrini said: 'It's a tough draw but these are the rules. It could have been easier but it could have been harder.'

Domestically City have started ominously well, with a 2-0 win at Newcastle followed by a show of strength at home as they beat Liverpool 3-1.

They face Stoke at the Etihad on Saturday and expectation is already rising - but Pellegrini thinks that is something they can handle.

He said: 'That expectation does not depend on one game against Liverpool - it depends always.

'We are a strong team, the same as five or six other clubs in England.

'We don't have a problem with that expectation. We need to win and we will try to win always.'
