The wife of a Mexican mayor whose police force turned 43 students over to a drug gang that allegedly killed them has been charged with organized crime and money laundering.

Maria de los Angeles Pineda is the wife of Jose Luis Abarca, the former mayor of Iguala, a city in southern Guerrero state. 

Pineda's brothers were leading members of the Guerreros Unidos drug gang, according to prosecutors. Federal prosecutor Tomas Zeron said Monday that Pineda has been charged with organized crime related to drug trafficking, and use of illicit funds.

In custody: Maria de los Angeles Pineda was  transferred to a Mexican state prison on Monday. She has been accused of turning a group of 43 students over to a gang to be mass murdered when the students threatened to interrupt a speech she was giving

Going behind bars: Pineda was the wife of the former mayor of the city of Iguala, and her brother was a member of the Guerrero Unidos drug gang 

Out of comfort: Pineda has been under house arrest since her arrest on November 4 in Mexico City. Pictures above on Monday, as she was being transferred to the federal prison

Abarca and Pineda were arrested November 4 in Mexico City.  Abarca was charged with organized crime, kidnapping and homicide in November, for events previous to the students' disappearance. 

Pineda had been held under a form of house arrest, but has now been transferred to a federal prison. It is unclear if the charges against her were related to the students' disappearance.

Video footage showed a grim-faced, stolid Pineda being escorted aboard a truck and then a plane as she was transferred to prison.

Abarca's police force allegedly worked hand-in-glove with the Guerreros Unidos gang. 

When students from a rural teacher's college went to Iguala to hijack buses on September 26, Iguala police detained them and turned them over to the gang, which then allegedly killed them and burned their bodies. 

Only one of the students has been identified from charred bits of bone.

Resting place: The group of 43 students are believed to have been mass murdered and then their remains burned. One of the victims was identified in a clandestine grave using DNA testing
