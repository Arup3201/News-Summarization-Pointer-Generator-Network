David Cameron admitted yesterday his decision to hire former News of the World editor Andy Coulson had ‘haunted’ them both.

The Prime Minister faced repeated questioning at the Leveson Inquiry over the assurances he sought from Mr Coulson about his knowledge of phone hacking at the paper before appointing him as his director of communications.

He said he had considered ‘two or three others’ – including former BBC journalist Guto Harri – for the job, but hired Mr Coulson in 2007 as ‘the only tabloid editor available’.

David Cameron admitted yesterday his decision to hire former News of the World editor Andy Coulson had 'haunted' them both

He insisted he, his chief of staff 
Ed Llewellyn and Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude sought assurances
from Mr Coulson, who resigned from the newspaper over the hacking 
scandal.

‘Why did I feel he deserved a second chance? Because I thought that he had done the honourable thing. Something very bad had happened on the newspaper he was editing. He did not know and he resigned,’ Mr Cameron told the inquiry into media ethics.

‘There were some people in the Conservative Party who would have said, “Don’t have a tabloid editor”. My view was that it was necessary to have someone tough and robust.’

The PM said he had considered 'two or three others' - including former BBC journalist Guto Harri (above) - for the job, but hired Mr Coulson in 2007 as 'the only tabloid editor available'

Mr Coulson – who resigned in January last  year and is now facing perjury charges in Scotland as well as being on bail in relation to allegations of phone hacking – had given similar assurances that he knew nothing of phone hacking to the police, Press Complaints Commission and the  Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, which had all ‘accepted his word’, he added.

‘So, yes, I accepted these undertakings but so did many other people and organisations... I just make one point, because I recognise this is a controversial appointment.

‘This has come back to haunt both him and me, but in doing the job of director of communication for the party and in Downing Street he did the job very effectively.’

Confirming that Chancellor George Osborne had thought the appointment was a ‘good idea’, the Prime Minister insisted the fact that Mr Coulson worked at and had close links with the Murdoch media empire had been irrelevant.

The Cabinet Office also testified that Mr Coulson was the first Downing Street communications director of recent times not to have been properly security vetted.

All six previous incumbents  had received so-called ‘developed  vetting’ – the most thorough such procedure – within seven months of taking the job.

But Mr Cameron dismissed accusations he had been lax in checking Mr Coulson out and said the whole issue was a ‘red herring’.

Cameron: Why Press must be self-regulated

The Prime Minister yesterday voiced his opposition to statutory regulation of newspapers, telling Lord Justice Leveson it would lead to ‘real concerns’ that the freedom of the Press could be compromised.

Instead, Mr Cameron advocated a ‘genuinely independent’ form of self-regulation ‘with teeth’, saying such a system would be ‘fantastic’.

And he told the inquiry the existing Press Complaints Commission under its new chief Lord Hunt should be given the chance to draw up this tougher, more accountable regime.

In what was seen as a clear rejection of some of the more draconian proposals floated during the inquiry, he said: ‘The Press and people who, like me, care about a free Press, have a real concern about ... full-on statutory regulation. We have to understand the real concern there is about statutory regulation.

'That doesn’t mean you rule it out, but it means try and make everything that can be independent work before you reach for that lever.

‘I worked in television where we had statutory regulation. Newspapers are different, and we have to respect that and understand that, so if we can make a self-regulatory system work that is genuinely independent, that would be fantastic.’

The Prime Minister said the new regulator should have the power to dish out significant penalties to organisations which flout the rules.

These would include ‘front page apologies’ for damaging or inaccurate stories, and the possibility of hefty fines. He also rejected a proposal to outlaw the blurring of news and comment in newspapers.

That idea, advanced by Lord Justice Leveson, has been described as dangerous by several serving politicians, who believe it would lead to government effectively engaging in censorship.

Mr Cameron fired another warning shot, saying: ‘I think it’s quite impractical. So often a headline encapsulates both a fact but also an opinion. It happens and I think it’s rather a forlorn hope to think you can somehow separate them.’

Mr Cameron’s views have been echoed by his fellow party leaders Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband, and Cabinet members George Osborne, Michael Gove and Theresa May.

The PM said the new system would have to be adhered to by every newspaper group and suggested that those who fail to sign up – such as the Express group, which pulled out of the PCC – could face a range of sanctions, including expulsion from the Parliamentary Lobby.

He said the system could be ‘effectively compulsory’ if No10 said: ‘If you’re not part of this, you’re not in the lobby, you don’t get any information from Government’.

He praised the ‘good ideas’ of Tory peer Lord Hunt, who has been working on plans to give ordinary people greater redress over stories they object to.

And the PM said it was right that ‘those of us who put ourselves in the public eye’ expect more scrutiny, pointing to a recent revelation about his own family.

‘They could probably safely leave their children in the pub and not have the same focus on them – which I do not complain about at all.’
