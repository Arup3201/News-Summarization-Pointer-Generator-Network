Federal agents have arrested more than 90 people and seized about five million packets of synthetic drugs, known on the street as bath salts, K2 and Spice.

The operation is the first U.S. nationwide crackdown on 'designer drugs', the Drug Enforcement Administration said yesterday.

The DEA said the haul from multi-agency raids in more than 100 U.S. cities included 4.8million packets of synthetic cannabis, 167,000 packets of 'bath salts' and more than $36million in cash.

Operation Log Jam: Federal agents have arrested more than 90 people and seized about five million packets of synthetic drugs, known on the street as bath salts, K2 and Spice

Operation Log Jam involved the DEA, five federal agencies, state and local police.

DEA Administrator Michele Leonhart said in a statement: 'It has disrupted the entire illegal industry, from manufacturers to retailers.

'Together
with our federal, state and local law enforcement partners, we are 
committed to targeting these new and emerging drugs with every 
scientific, legislative and investigative tool at our disposal.'

Synthetic drugs - with street names 
like bath salts or plant food - mimic more traditional illegal narcotics
like cocaine, LSD, MDMA and methamphetamine, and have rapidly grown in 
popularity.

Bath salts have been blamed in several incidents of erratic and violent behaviour across the U.S.

Smokable herbal blends marketed as 
Spice, K2, Blaze, and Red X Dawn and labelled as incense contain illegal
psychoactive compounds that mimic THC, the active ingredient in 
marijuana.

Bath salts are likely to be stimulant drugs such MPDV or ephedrine.

Bath salts does not refer to a single chemical, but instead to a range of synthetic drugs that can be sold legally in the U.S. as long as they are not marked for human consumption – hence the misleading name.

Drugs such as MPDV are highly potent stimulants, similar to some amphetamines, and in MPDV's case particularly, cause a strong compulsion to 'redose' with more of the drug.

In high doses, such drugs can cause violent and unpredictable behaviour, and terrifying hallucinations – and the compulsion to take more of the drug continues, even once the 'high' has begun to make the user feel bad.

They have become popular among teens and young adults.

New research suggests the drug affects the brain in the same way as cocaine.

The drug's active ingredient is mephedrone. Scientists have shown that mephedrone acts the same way as cocaine in the brain - giving it the potential for abuse and addiction.

Studies were conducted on mice using a technique developed in the 1950s - intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) - that measures a drug's ability to activate reward circuits.

In ICSS studies, animals are trained to perform a behavioural task - pressing a lever or button with their nose or spinning a wheel - to receive a reward.

Mice were implanted with brain stimulating electrodes, with measures of their wheel spinning effort made before, during and after they received various doses of either mephedrone or cocaine.

Dr Carl Malanga, of the University of North Carolina, explained: 'One of the unique features of ICSS is that all drugs of abuse, regardless of how they work pharmacologically, do very similar things to ICSS: they make ICSS more rewarding.'

Results of the Behavioural Brain Research study showed cocaine increased the ability of mice to be rewarded by self-stimulation and mephedrone did the same.

On July 9, President Barack Obama signed into law legislation passed by Congress to permanently ban the sale of bath salts in the U.S.

'Bath salts' have been implicated in a recent spate of violent attacks across the U.S.:
