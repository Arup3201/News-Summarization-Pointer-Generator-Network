Reverend Kat Campion-Spall of St Mary's Church in Merton weeps after the session which allowed women bishops

The Church of England finally voted yesterday to let women become bishops – to the anger of many traditionalists.

The move was passed by a comfortable majority at a tense gathering of its parliament, the General Synod, in York.

It ended 14 years of hand-wringing and faction-fighting, delighting Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and almost all of his fellow bishops.

The decision freed the Church from the risk of intervention by politicians.

MPs had threatened to step in to force the Church to accept women bishops in 2012, after a disastrously botched vote saw traditionalists narrowly block reform.

David Cameron described yesterday’s vote as ‘a great day for the Church and for equality’. Ed Miliband said it was ‘wonderful news’, while Nick Clegg called the decision a ‘long overdue step’.

But some evangelical conservatives and Anglo-Catholics – a branch of the Church which affirms its Catholic heritage – were left divided and angry, having long argued that the Bible and tradition do not permit women to become bishops. One said he had ‘betrayed’ his supporters, while others accused Synod members of being too worried about outside reaction.

Their comments provoked protests from Church liberals and left the Synod chairman, the Archbishop of York John Sentamu, calling for quiet, telling its members not to behave like rowdy MPs.

The crucial vote, in which lay members of the Synod approved women bishops by a majority of more than three to one, led to clapping and a single shout of ‘brill’.

Only Parliamentary formalities now remain before the Church can appoint its first female bishop.

This is expected to come early next year, 21 years after women were first ordained as priests by the CofE.

The vote yesterday which approved the consecration of women bishops overturned centuries of tradition

How long has the row been rumbling on?

The debate over female bishops started soon after women were ordained as priests 20 years ago. The CofE set up the committees and inquiries that led to yesterday’s vote in 2000.

What went on before?

The vote in the General Synod that was meant to finally approve women bishops ended in narrow defeat for reformers in November 2012.

Who is opposed?

Anglo-catholics, who believe the Bible and tradition do not allow women bishops, and conservative evangelicals, who believe the Bible says women should not be church leaders.

What is different now?

In 2012, it was felt there were too few provisions for those opposed to female bishops. But Church leaders have now drawn up a new compromise, including a dispute procedure.

How does the new plan work?

The CofE has laid out principles saying that women shall have the full powers of male bishops and that everyone must recognise the decision. All dioceses, even those dominated by traditionalists, must include a junior bishop who will ordain and promote women.

But it recognises that opponents of women bishops have the right to ‘flourish’ – so there must be ‘pastoral and sacramental provision’ for disputes.

What about disputes?

Church councils which oppose the move can send their bishop a resolution stating that they do not want a woman vicar or clergy, nor any male priests who have been ordained by women bishops. They should then be sent male clergy when jobs become vacant.

If an objecting parish is in a diocese run by a woman bishop, she will allow it to be supervised by a male junior bishop. If no junior bishop is available within the diocese, one can be brought in from outside.

What if there are still arguments?

There will be an appeals system, in which parishes can turn to an ‘independent reviewer’. But if a parish does not accept an appeal decision they can be subject to disciplinary action, which can culminate in dismissal from the Church.

The first appointment may be seen as an anti-climax, with a woman picked to fill a junior post, subordinate to a male bishop.

After
 the vote, the Archbishop of York led the General Synod in a rendition 
of We are Marching in the Light of God, with members clapping along, 
some even shedding tears of joy.

Reverend
 Dr Rosemarie Mallett, from Southwark diocese, said yesterday: ‘I’m 
absolutely joyful, thank God after 20 years of very hard work we now 
have a decision that can help us work for everyone in the Church.

Yesterday’s vote came nearly 20 months after the Church’s last attempt to approve a law allowing women bishops. The lost Synod vote in November 2012 left the then Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, humiliated and apparently with little hope of reviving the cause for several years.

But a new compromise, which allows scope for traditionalists to challenge the appointment of a female bishop in their parish, was brought to the vote in record time.

The plan is based on the hope of compromise between opposing liberals and conservatives.

Archbishop Welby said CofE members must ‘continue to demonstrate love for those who disagree on theological grounds’.

He added: ‘As delighted as I am for the outcome of this vote I am also mindful of those within the Church for whom the result will be difficult and a cause of sorrow.’

During the debate, Guildford traditionalist Adrian Vincent said he would reverse his position from 2012 and vote in favour.

‘By doing so, I am betraying what I believe, I am betraying those who trusted in me,’ he said.

‘I hope that the promised commitment to mutual flourishing is not a commitment that will run out of steam in a few years.’ But opponent Dr Chik Kaw Tan, of Lichfield, said: ‘Men and women are equal but their roles are not interchangeable ... if we allow the Church to be guided by secular thinking our teaching will soon unravel.’

In 2012, the House of Laity voted just six short of the necessary two to one majority.

Yesterday, it voted 152 to 45 for women bishops.
