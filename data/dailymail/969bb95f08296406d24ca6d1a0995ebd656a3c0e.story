Michael Baptist left his shaken victim with blood pouring from her nose after viciously swinging at her close to Newcastle's Bigg Market just after midnight.

Mr Baptist, who lives in Newcastle with his mother Sarah, 47, father Steven, 49, and twin brothers Steven and Alan, 24, was said to be 'distraught' at the situation.

Named and shamed: The yob who punched a woman in the face on New Year's Eve has been identified as 19-year-old scaffolder Michael Baptist

The teenager, accompanied by his parents, handed himself into Etal Lane police station in Newcastle yesterday, close to the family's home.

Northumbria Police confirmed a man had volunteered to speak to officers in connection with the incident.

Michael was asked to return to the station after officers have spoken to his alleged victim, said to be a 18-year-old student.

His father told The Sun: 'It's totally out of character for him. He's a good lad. We've just come back from speaking to the police. They're going to speak to the girl.'

The woman was left with a bloody nose after the bust-up and received treatment from the St John Ambulance

The punch was thrown after two men and two women appeared to get into an argument in Newcastle's Bigg Market just after midnight

A family friend added: 'We were all stunned when we saw his picture in The Sun. He's such a quiet, shy boy normal. But I've heard he's not when he gets a drink in him. He can get rowdy.'

Dramatic pictures captured the moment a row broke out between revellers  on an evening in which drunken fun led to fighting in many towns and cities.

After the argument became heated, the man alleged to be Michael Baptist is seen throwing a punch at one of the women, as another woman tries to hold him back.

A later photo then shows the victim trying to find medical help as blood streams down her face.

A witness to the incident told The Sun the man was pushed before striking out, punching the woman in the face. She was then treated by St John Ambulance.

A spokesman for Northumbria Police said today: 'A 19-year-old man attended Etal Lane Police Station on Friday January 2 voluntarily.

'Initial inquiries have been carried out with an 18-year-old victim.'
