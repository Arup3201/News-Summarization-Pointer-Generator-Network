A single police force had nearly 800 car crashes this year, with repairs costing a staggering £396,000, it has emerged.

Thames Valley Police recorded 789 crashes involving its patrol cars, with over half of the incidents deemed the fault of the police driver.

Thirty members of the public were injured in collisions with vehicles from the force which covers Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire.

A teenager was killed in one of the accidents when his car collided with a central reservation while he was being pursued by two Thames Valley vehicles.

Matt Seddon's body was thrown into the road and hit by a police car in the incident which has seen eight officers and a member of civilian staff served with misconduct notices.

Kevin Clinton, head of road safety at 
the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, said: 'When we need 
the police's help, we all want them to get there as quickly as possible,
 which often requires them to drive in ways that create extra risk to 
the officers and to other road users, as these figures tragically 
illustrate.

'These risks 
must be balanced and managed; the worst thing for everyone is one 
emergency turning into two emergencies because of a crash en-route to 
the original incident.

'High speed, emergency drives should only be undertaken when essential and by authorised and trained police drivers.

'Even
 in these times of reduced public spending, it's crucial that police 
forces maintain their driver and motorcycle training - for the sake of 
their own officers and for members of the public.'

Thames Valley Police press officers have not responded to requests for comment.

Surrey Police logged 477 incidents ranging from serious collisions to windscreen chips with repairs to vehicles costing £374,058.

Two people were killed in and 20 were injured as a result of incidents in which the force was involved, with Surrey Police drivers at fault for 37 crashes.

A spokesman for Surrey Police said: 'Only a small percentage of the incidents involve a third party.

'The
 majority of Surrey Police vehicles are in constant 24-hour use and are 
used to respond swiftly and effectively to a number of challenging 
emergency situations.

'The 
force polices parts of some of the major arterial routes in the region 
such as the M25, the M3 and the A3, in addition to the county's rural 
road network.'

The spokesman
 added: 'Any collision involving a police vehicle is treated extremely 
seriously and any cases which result in serious injury or death are 
automatically referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission 
to provide independent scrutiny.'

A Hampshire police officer was killed in one of the 413 crashes recorded by the force with 26 members of the public suffering injuries in others.

More than 300 of the crashes were caused 
by Hampshire Police personnel, causing damage which cost the force a 
total of £172,371 pounds. The force had 1,045 vehicles on the road in 
the last year.

A Hampshire Police spokesman said: 'Our 
fleet of vehicles covered 15.8 million miles in all weather conditions 
in 2012/13 but were involved in an incident where blame can be 
attributed to the police driver once every 53,000 miles.

'Although the vast majority of incidents were minor collisions, any incident involving a police vehicle is regrettable.'
