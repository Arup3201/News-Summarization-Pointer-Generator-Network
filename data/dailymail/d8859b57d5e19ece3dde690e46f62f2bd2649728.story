After looking around, the blonde mother of two spoke extensively with patients at PARC, the physical activity research centre, and, according to the Vancouver Sun, asked detailed questions about every single person she spoke with.

'It was almost worth putting a suit on for,' said Mike Skelton, who showed the countess how the equipment worked. 

Volunteer Mustafa Hasan also showcased a robotic exoskeleton, a piece of equipment that allows him to stand and walk. 

Busy schedule: The couple are packing the activities into their whistle-stop tour. On Monday, they will travel to Vancouver Island and meet with First Nations before making a trip to Kelowna on Tuesday
