While the Duchess of Cambridge won the hearts of Australians during her royal visit last month, the very elegant Crown Princess of Denmark ensured she left quite an impression on the very first day of her three-day visit in Poland.

The native Australian opted for a chic black and white ensemble teamed with a feathered facinator as she attended a number of official events on Monday.

The princess matched her head piece with pastel pink heels and gloves while teaming it with a white coat, a black pleated dress and a clutch.

The Crown Prince of Denmark steered clear of the fashion limelight and wore a simple dark grey suit with a blue shirt and red tie.
