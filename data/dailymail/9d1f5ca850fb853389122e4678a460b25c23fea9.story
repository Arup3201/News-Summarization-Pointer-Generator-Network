A rise in sadistic murders and attacks on children accused of witchcraft by their families and loved-ones means police will now receive specialist training.

The Met has admitted its officers are rarely able to spot the signs that a youngster is in danger despite dealing with 81 sorcery cases in the last decade.

Its religious violence unit will now offer all staff training in a pilot scheme that could be rolled out across the country after a spate of high profile cases.

Tragic victims: Innocent Kristy Bamu, 15, left, was killed by his sister and her lover because they believed he was a witch. While Victoria Climbié, right, was tortured and starved by carers who said she was possessed

Last month a woman who tortured her teenage brother to death after accusing him of witchcraft was jailed for life.

Magalie Bamu and her boyfriend Eric Bikubi inflicted more than 130 injuries on 15-year-old Kristy Bamu over the course of a horrific four-day attack in Newham, east London.

While eight-year-old Victoria Climbié was
tortured and starved to death twelve years ago partly because the 
people who should have cared for her believed she was possessed.

Detective Superintendent Terry Sharpe, head of the Metropolitan Police's Religious Violence Unit, told the Independent: 'We're very well aware that usually the first person on scene is going to be the young cop with two or three years' service who probably has no understanding of this whatsoever.

'We're not naïve enough to think this is just happening in London. It is happening in Birmingham, it's happening in Leeds, Manchester and other big cities across the country.'

A new booklet is to be handed to all officers and new recruits will get extra training.

The paperwork will spell out language they should listen for when they enter homes and how to judge whether any child is at risk.

Magalie Bamu, right, were both jailed for life for the horrific torture 
of Magalie's brother Kristy, which led to his death

This summer the Government will also send out similar advice to GPs, hospitals and schools so they can better spot the signs.

Witchcraft abuse and female genital 
mutilation are most often carried out by the religious and superstitious
in Britain's immigrant communities.

Killers Bamu and Bikubi, like many Congolese nationals, were obsessed with kindoki, or witchcraft.

The couple accused innocent Kristy of 
trying to bewitch a child in the family after he arrived from Paris for 
Christmas 2010 with four of his siblings at their council flat.

Violent evidence: Kristy Bamu suffered 130 injuries after being tortured for four days with weapons including broken ceramic floor tiles

Witchcraft: These weapons were found at the scene in what officers called an 'unprecedented scenario'

The pair beat him with a metal weightlifting pole, a curtain rod and a wooden plank, knocked out his teeth with a hammer and smashed heavy floor tiles over his head.

The torso of a Nigerian boy, named Adam by police, was previously found in the Thames after he was ritually sacrificed.

Police believe he may have been killed by someone with a terminal illness who believed his murder would save them.

In 2005, three people were convicted of beating, cutting and rubbing chilli peppers in the eyes of an eight-year-old Angolan girl to ‘beat the devil out of her’.
