Tragedy: 10-year-old Eric Klyaz was shot in the chest Tuesday afternoon while playing with a friend in his Southern California apartment complex

Eric Klyaz, a 10-year-old in Miramar Ranch North, California, died Tuesday after accidentally being shot in the chest.

The shooting occurred at an apartment complex on Ivy Hill drive, in a garage owned by a neighbor's family.

Klyaz was playing with a 9-year-old girl in her parent's garage when a repairman heard a single gun shot and the girl screaming.

He found the two kids in the garage and called 911 - dispatchers then instructed him on how to perform CPR.

A neighbor, Mike Mee, also heard the gunshots and ran to the scene.

Mee told San Diego 6 that he 'saw a young child laying on the floor in the fetal position with his back and there appeared to be a blood spot on his right side.

Klyaz was on the floor, and the gun was laying on a nearby sofa.

Police investigators said it was unclear yet whether Klyaz brought the handgun himself, or if the two found the 9mm semi-automatic in the garage. It was also unclear who shot the gun.

The girl's parents were not home at the time of the shooting - her 14-year-old brother was in charge of her.

After hearing the gun shots, Klyaz's father rushed out and found his son, who was not breathing. He cradled his son's head as CPR was performed on the boy.

An injured Klyaz was rushed to Rady Children's Hospital, but was pronounced dead there later.

Klyaz was a fourth grader at Dingeman Elementary, and had celebrated his tenth birthday the weekend before.

Before the shooting, neighbors saw him riding his scooter around the neighborhood. Neighbor Michelle Rhea said he played with her children almost every day.

Rhea described Klyaz to San Diego 6:'He was very sweet, he was very athletic. He loved to ride his bike and his scooter and he used to sound really creative and just - he was a nice kid.'

Pending the investigation, the owners of the gun could face charges such as negligent storage of a firearm.
