Wind turbines and solar panels have often been touted as the solution to the growing energy crisis, but could the answer really lie in the movement of water and air?

That’s what one company based out of Maryland thinks - The Solar Wind Energy, Inc. has recently been given permission to build a giant downdraft tower.

Known as the Solar Wind Energy Tower, it would stand nearly half a mile (0.8 kilometres) tall and generate as much power as the Hoover Dam.

The Solar Wind Downdraft Tower (artist's illustration shown) is the first hybrid solar-wind renewable energy technology on the market. The patented structure is comprised of a tall hollow cylinder with a water injection system near the top and wind tunnels containing turbines near the bottom

The tower works by spraying water in at the top, making air heavy and causing it to fall, which causes 120 huge turbines to turn at the bottom.

At peak operation, during a particularly sunny day, the tower can apparently produce 1,250 megawatt-hours - roughly equivalent to the power output of wind turbines spread over 100,000 acres.

But the main advantage of this system, according to the company, is that it can run day and night and it does not rely on particular weather, such as wind or sunshine, to operate.

Downdraft technology is not entirely new, but the company claims they have an innovative new patent that makes it more feasible.

One of the biggest drawbacks was the sheer size and cost of attempting to construct such a tower.

But now they have been given permission to begin the funding and operation of the project in San Luis, Arizona.

The company also hopes to export the technology to other countries including Chile, India and the Middle East.

Water is sprayed in at the top of the structure, which stands 2,250 feet (685 metres) tall, almost twice the height of the Empire State Building.

This causes hot air to become heavy, and it then falls through the tower.

At the bottom of the tower are 120 turbines, with the ability to circulate 2.5 billion gallons of water.

As it falls through the tower the air reaches speeds of up to 50 miles (80 kilometres) per hour.

This runs the turbines and produces power, some of which is used to pump water back to the top.

The exterior of the tower could also have ‘wind vanes’ that would capture wind and use it to produce additional electrical power.

This makes it, according to the company, the first ‘hybrid solar-wind renewable energy technology’ on the market.

The system can run 24 hours a day, but it does require large amounts of water.

It also needs to be in an environment with hot air, which is why the Arizona desert is ideal.

One possible stumbling block could be the cost of the project, which is estimated to be about $1.5 billion (£890 million).

However, Solar Wind Energy have been granted preliminary funding by National Standard Finance, which should make the project feasible.

On their website, the company outlines their goal of eventually building multiple towers and providing a new source of renewable energy.

‘Each Tower will be constructed on location using conventional materials, equipment and techniques, associated industries, as well as local workers in the surrounding town or city,’ they write.

‘Each location will benefit significantly from the creation of professional manufacturing, construction and transportation jobs, in addition to having a high efficiency energy resource close by – providing clean renewable energy at a cost more favourable than nuclear plants with no negative impacts to the environment.’

At peak operation, during a particularly sunny day, the tower can apparently produce 1,250 megawatts per hour - roughly equivalent to the power output of wind turbines spread over 100,000 acres and about the same as the Hoover Dam in Nevada (pictured)
