New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie says he's 'readier' to be president than he was a few years ago and has hit back at claims he knew about Bridgegate as 'ridiculous' and 'arrogant.'

He claimed in a softball interview conducted by Yahoo! News on Friday that the hardball experience of learning about incriminating emails sent by his deputy chief of staff, Bridget Kelly, was 'completely disorienting, like I got hit across the forehead with a 2x4.'

Pressure on Christie has intensified in the last week as his political and campaign offices and 18 aides and political appointees received subpoenas for documents related to the George Washington Bridge fiasco.

And Fort Lee mayor Mark Sokolich isn't the only Democratic city official to take pot shots at the Republican governor.

Dirty politics: Christie appeared with Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer (L) following Superstorm Sandy. She now claims she was told aid cash would be cut off unless she gave support to a controversial development

Offensive: Christie's Lt. Gov. today branded Zimmer's claims 'completely false' and 'illogical' before she met volunteers during the Dr Martin Luther King Jr National Day in Union Beach, New Jersey

Christie's lieutenant governor, Kim Guadagno, was forced to defend herself Monday against claims from Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer that she and Christie held Hurricane Sandy relief money hostage, pressuring her to green-light a commercial development plan in her city.

Guadagno held a brief news conference where she read a statement calling Zimmer's claims 'completely false' and 'illogical.', but then refused to take questions from reporters.

Zimmer fired back almost immediately.

'I am genuinely disappointed that 
Lieutenant Governor Guadagno has lived up to her promise that she would 
deny linking Hoboken's application for Sandy hazard mitigation funding 
with expediting a private development project,' she said.

A day before Zimmer made her stunning claim, the governor addressed the bridge scandal in his Yahoo! interview with uninterrupted soliloquies seemingly rife with talking points.

Asked to explain how Kelly, one of his closest advisers, could have carried out the bridge traffic scheme without his knowledge, he insisted that he didn't know what she was up to on a day-to-day basis.

'Now I understand that people say, well ... this is someone in your office,' he said.

But 'if someone doesn’t tell you the truth, there is often very little you can do in reaction to that.'

Threat: Zimmer wrote in her diary that Guadagno: 'Pulls me aside and says that I need to move forward with the Rockefeller project. It's very important to the governor... the word is that you are against it...and you need to move forward or we are not going to be able to help you'

Christie has said he and the Hoboken mayor have had a good relationship, but her journal outlines a governor-endorsed plan to use Sandy funds as political leverage -- something his administration flatly denies

Referring to banking giant JP 
Morgan's loss of $ billion in 2012 by a rogue trader a continent away, 
Christie compared himself to the bank's CEO.

'How
 could Jamie Dimon not have known about a trade that was being put on by
 a trader in London? Well, you know, I think it’s fairly safe to say 
that Jamie Dimon didn’t know that a trade was being put on, and that 
when people lied about it, he didn’t know they were lying. ... So I 
think that’s a ridiculous criticism and kind of an ignorant one.'

A
 sighing Christie reflected, first to Yahoo and then later on Twitter: 
'I'm trying to get my arms around an awful situation, and understand it,
 and then address it, and then resolve it.'

But the governor told Yahoo that he's better prepared to be president than he was a few years ago.

'Yeah. I’m readier, if that’s a word,' Christie said.

Christie
 may soon have to personally address and resolve the possibility that 
his lieutenant governor's interactions with Zimmer took on the flavor of
 political blackmail in the months following Superstorm Sandy.

Zimmer said Saturday that she had met with federal prosecutors and provided copies of her journal showing that Lieutenant Gov. Guadagno pressured her to approve a real estate development favored by Christie, saying Sandy relief dollars won't flow to Hoboken until she did.

'She pulls me aside and says that I need to move forward with the Rockefeller project. It’s very important to the governor,' Zimmer recalled in her journal. 'The word is that you are against it and you need to move forward or we are not going to be able to help you.'

'She wrote at the time that Guadagno promised: 'If you tell anyone I said it, I will deny it.'

'She said that to me – is that this is a direct message from the Governor,' Zimmer said on CNN's 'State of the Union' program.

'Readier' to be president: Despite the taint of scandal from multiple directions, Christie insists he's politically on track

A stretch? Christie said keeping tabs on Bridget Kelly, a senior aide in his Trenton, N.J. office, was as difficult as JP Morgan's CEO in New York staying on top of a security trader's activity in London

In
 a statement later, she said she would be willing to 'testify under oath
 about the facts of what happened when the Lieutenant Governor came to 
Hoboken and told me that Sandy aid would be contingent on moving forward
 with a private development project.'

Guadagno – among the few top figures 
in the Christie administration to remain untainted by the bridge scandal
 – responded on Monday at a Martin Luther King Jr. holiday service 
project.

'Mayor Zimmer's
 version of our conversation in May of 2013 is not only false but is 
illogical and does not withstand scrutiny when all of the facts are 
examined,' she said.

'Any suggestion that Sandy funds were tied to the approval of any project in New Jersey is completely false.'

'I deny any suggestion made by Mayor Zimmer that there was ever any condition on the release of Sandy funds by me,' she added during her brief statement to the press.

Zimmer shot back, saying she was 'genuinely disappointed.'

The slow drip of percolating scandals surrounding Christie now seems to be an impediment to what was considered an easy road to the top tier of Republican presidential hopefuls just a few months ago.

Christie aides told The New York Times that an overseas trip planned to boost his foreign policy bona fides was still 'to be determined.'

Matt Mowers, Christie's man in New Hampshire, the state party leader who formerly served on his re-election campaign staff, is himself under subpoena.

And former Republcian National Committee chairman Michael Steele criticized the governor for jetting to Palm Beach, Florida for a fundraising trial balloon as subpoenas flew out of a majority-Democratic legislative committee in his state capitol.

'They dropped 20 subpoenas on him, and so now that’s baggage that’s going to come into the conversation,' he said.

MSNBC, the most liberal of U.S. cable 
news networks, broke the Zimmer story, devoting much of its weekend 
coverage to the brewing episode.

Christie
 spokesman Colin Reed, who is under subpoena himself in the bridge 
scandal, said Saturday that 'it's very clear partisan politics are at 
play here as Democratic mayors with a political ax to grind come out of 
the woodwork and try to get their faces on television'

'MSNBC
 is a partisan network that has been openly hostile to Governor 
Christie,' he said, 'and almost gleeful in their efforts attacking him.'
