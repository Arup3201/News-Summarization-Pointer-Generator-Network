The pilot Prince: William at the controls of a helicopter before his son George was born

He always said giving up his flying career would be a wrench. But even Prince William’s closest friends are surprised by quite how strong the pull of piloting his own helicopter has proved to be.

Little more than eight months after quitting the Armed Forces and his role as an RAF search and rescue pilot, it emerged this week that the Prince is itching to get airborne again.

Plans are being drawn up that could see him joining the East Anglian Air Ambulance service, based near his country home, Anmer Hall, in Norfolk.

Some will doubtless see this as perverse, but then William has always been something of a ‘reluctant royal’.

Even with last year’s announcement that he wanted to devote himself to conservation and charitable projects, it was also made clear that he had no wish to become a full-time working member of the Royal Family.

From his military career to wanting to be a farmer, to full-time dad to hankering after a return to the helicopter cockpit, all have crossed the Prince’s mind — anything that delays the inevitability of his royal role.

Yet when the Prince has carried out public duties — as he and the Duchess of Cambridge did in Scotland on Thursday — he has done them with great aplomb.

His visit with Kate to Australia and New Zealand last month was such a success and PR coup, thanks partly to the winning presence of son George, that anti-monarchy support Down Under slumped to its lowest level for 35 years.

To the frustration of royal aides the issues that now cloud the mind of this young man — who is, surely, with his wife and son the House of Windsor’s greatest asset — have turned the clock back to another period of uncertainty in William’s life, the time when he dated but seemed reluctant to marry Kate Middleton.

They are asking if Prince William is now wobbling over his career in the same way he once wobbled over his choice of wife.

It may be hard to picture now but almost exactly seven years ago the relationship between William and Kate was almost dead and buried. After more than four years together, they split up after William was photographed in a nightclub with his arm around a pretty young woman, his hand apparently cupping her right breast.

Kate, who was already enduring the barbs of her ‘Waity Katie’ nickname was not looking for a ring. She simply wanted to know where she stood and that he was committed to her.

Faced with what he saw as her demand for his long-term commitment, William declined to give it. And on that sad and uneasy note the romance was abruptly ended.

As we know it was not terminal. Kate resolved to show William what he was missing, partying in thigh-skimming skirts. Three months later, William, in the words of one of her friends, ‘came crawling back’.

Now it seems similar uncertainties have come crowding in as William struggles to adjust to a life that demands an increasing commitment to royal duties, and puts him more firmly in the limelight than he enjoys.

Should he — having first obtained a commercial pilot’s licence — take a role with the air ambulance? The decision would expose the question that lies at the heart of William’s hesitant attitude to his role in the monarchy; just what kind of prince does he want to be?

Like his mother princess Diana, he is a man of contradictions, capable of exhibiting a common touch. Palace aides, for example, to the fact that whether they feel obliged to or not, William does not expect staff to bow to him or curtsey to Kate, and deny that, like his father, he possesses a short temper.

So what has brought on this problem? According to a friend he has missed the camaraderie of his air-sea rescue days in North Wales more than he realised.

‘He genuinely loves flying and he loved being part of a proper working team in which he could be pretty anonymous and not given any special privileges,’ the friend explains.

‘I think he has now found his royal life rather boring and feels he is worth more than just shaking hands.’

William has always been something of a 'reluctant royal'

There is no doubt that being in uniform gave William a structure and routine that allowed him and Kate to live as ‘normal’ a life as possible. Since moving from their simple whitewashed Anglesey farmhouse to their grand Kensington Palace apartment so much has changed.

The couple’s altered circumstances have coincided with a growing number of official engagements being passed to Prince William as he and the Prince of Wales take on more of the ageing Queen’s duties.

So the idea that he might return to flying will not thrill courtiers who fear a spanner is being thrown into the well-oiled royal works.

But then William, 32, next month, has always been a headstrong young man intent on doing things his way. It was he who chose the moment to announce his engagement — and the date of the wedding, ignoring officials who wanted the nuptials to be held in the summer.

It was he who from the outset included Kate’s parents in all the plans — unlike previous royal in-laws. And it was William who decided to give his fiancée his late mother’s iconic sapphire and diamond engagement ring.

‘He likes to be doing things — but not being told what to do as he is for royal duties,’ says a friend. ‘Talking to him the other day he was enthusing about the farming course he had gone on at Cambridge earlier this year. It gave him a purpose.

‘There is no doubt he misses the adrenaline rush of flying his own helicopter. Saving lives piloting an air ambulance would be the kind of excitement he has been missing. And he would be making the decisions rather than being told what to do by someone else.’

There is one other crucial factor — privacy. According to a close friend, the publication this week in Germany of a tasteless picture of Kate’s bottom, snapped in Australia when a gust of wind caught her flimsy dress, has infuriated William.

‘He cannot bear that every time they perform public duties they are being scrutinised for everything they say and do,’ says the friend.

‘It is how he remembers his mother being treated and he is determined neither he, Kate nor George will suffer the same way.’

On Thursday he will visit an air ambulance team during a trip to Crieff, near Perth, with his wife, the Duchess of Cambridge

After Diana’s death William was given considerable privacy at school and university and he managed to prolong this by choosing a military career.

Since his teenage years, William’s single-mindedness to do things his way has marked him out. It is why he did not join in when he might have been persuaded to fall in with roistering friends and do foolish things —– drugs, for example —– which characterised the growing-up years of his brother Harry.

This self-control and assurance was something prized within the Royal Family. The Queen in particular knew how much stronger willed William was than his father, and appreciated that he was more positive than Charles who so often seemed to be wringing his hands about this or that.

‘William was seen as a young man who makes up his mind about something and then he does it,’ says a Palace figure.

But now, just as the royal roadshow needs to shift more towards Charles and his sons, William’s stubbornness suddenly appears not to be such an asset.

‘The Queen is 88 and quite simply the younger royals, like William and Harry, will have to do more royal engagements, not fewer. Equally, the popularity of William and Kate in particular cannot be overstated.’

Quite how these increased royal demands could be met by the Duke of Cambridge if he started to fly air ambulances — which might involve him working ten-hour shifts on a rota of five days on and three days off — is unclear. ‘There are bound to be some misgivings,’ says the figure.

Charles is sympathetic to his son’s wishes because he always regretted leaving the Royal Navy and losing his action-man life when he was still young.

For William, however noble the intention, the danger remains that such a move will be seen as an attempt to postpone his royal destiny.

It may be that William, who didn’t realise what he had with Kate until he had almost let her go, needs to apply the same cool head that allowed him to swallow his pride then, and make up his mind.

Queen and country deserve that.
