Match-winner Danny Welbeck celebrated securing three 'vital' points as his goal fired Arsenal to a 1-0 Barclays Premier League victory at West Brom.

The England striker headed Santi Cazorla's cross beyond Ben Foster to help his side secure victory. The hosts went close to equalising late on as Saido Berahino rattled the crossbar with a header.

Following Arsenal's 2-0 midweek Champions League win against Borussia Dortmund - which came after back-to-back Premier League defeats - Welbeck feels confidence is high among his team-mates.

He told BT Sport: 'I think the clean sheet's very important and we always believed in ourselves to score goals so it was a vital three points for us today.

'It's only one game and the most important thing is to take it one game at a time and we have to prepare well for every single match.

'When we go into games we really want to get the three points.'

Cazorla added: 'It was an important game for us because we needed to win. The last two games have been important for the confidence of the team and we played very well.

'When I play with (Welbeck) it is good and the team's performance was good and now we need to continue playing the same way.'
