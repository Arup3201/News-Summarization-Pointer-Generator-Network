Patricia Baines, 62, failed to inform authorities that her mother Dorothy passed away in August 1986 and stole almost £70,000 by collecting her pension

A daughter who stole almost £70,000 by collecting her dead mother's pension for  17 years has been spared jail.

Patricia Baines failed to inform authorities that her mother Dorothy passed away in August 1986.

Officers found £6,000 of the cash hidden in the 62-year-old's shed during a police search, Nottingham Crown Court heard. 

Baines, of Arnold, Nottinghamshire, was given a 26-week prison sentence, suspended for two years, on Friday after pleading guilty to theft earlier this year.

An investigation is now under way to establish where the rest of the money is. 

Recorder David Chinery said he took account of her personal circumstances and decided not to send her to prison, even though her crime crossed the custody threshold.

He said: 'I think you are a vulnerable lady and I am comforted to hear you now have support and are prepared to let people assist you.'

Baines stole  £68,211.13 between August 1986 and April 2013, the court heard.

Justin Wigoder, prosecuting, said the defendant's father  received the pension under the Nottinghamshire Local Pension Scheme.

His wife then claimed a widow's pension until her death, when Baines should have alerted the authorities.

Mr Wigoder said Baines abused a position of trust.

He said: 'The pension should have ceased. This defendant did not notify Nottinghamshire local government of her mother's death and she carried on receiving over 17 years.'

Digby Johnson, defending, said Baines was of good character. 

He added that she recently let the Salvation Army into her life to help.

Recorder David Chinery told Nottingham Crown Court he took of account her personal circumstances and decided not to send her to prison, even though her crime crossed the custody threshold

He said: 'Before, she said she was okay. The reality is she was not.

'She will let The Salvation Army into her home and will accept the support that they can give. I'm confident there is genuine support there.'
