Marouane Fellaini claims the reason he went down in pain during Tuesday's 2-1 win over Stoke was because he twisted his neck in an incident with  Oussama Assaidi.

Assaidi's outstretched leg seemed to just catch the Belgian on the hand in the middle of the park, but Fellaini bizarrely went to the ground in pain holding his neck as Stoke went on to equalise through Steven N'Zonzi.

He remained down as the goal flew in, but Fellaini insists he was injured, not play-acting to gain a free-kick.

Some have criticised Fellaini for the reaction, but the Belgian insists he cricked his neck

He said after the game: 'My neck twist a little bit, I stayed down because I felt the pain and they scored so, unlucky as well.'

Fellaini scored with a towering header in the first-half, and despite N'Zonzi's equaliser, United went on to win through Juan Mata's strike in the second-half.

Fellaini said: 'It's a good moment, a good goal I think and a good cross. We won and it's an important win. Now we have to stay focussed and the luck was with us.

'Today we didn't play very well but we won the game, that's the most important thing.

'We will see, we take it game by game and will see at the end of the season.'
