Seven motorcyclists have been arrested and dozens more issued citations after a pack of up to 50 bikers wearing in Halloween masks terrorized several Long Island towns.

The bikers sped through residential areas in Brentwood, Islip, Bay Shore and Deer Park in Suffolk County on Sunday afternoon.

Dozens of 911 calls were logged from residents reporting a gang of bikers riding recklessly between 3pm and 4pm.

When police responded to calls about a disturbance on Sunrise Ave at Deer Park Ave, the motorcyclists spread out and fled.

According to CBS, seven motorcyclists aged between 19 and 35 were arrested for reckless driving.

One, Joel Hernandez, 19, of Brentwood, was charged with criminal mischief and reckless driving after he allegedly backed into a police car.

More than 30 more were charged with trespassing for congregating behind a municipal building in Bay Shore.

The New York Post reports that the riders were clad in hoodies and skeleton masks for the pre-Hallween ride.

Resident Jason Tunbull told the Post that the bikers 'were acting pretty foolish, doing wheelies and getting in the way.

Suffolk County Police Sergeant Rocco 
Baudo said that many motorists who reported the bikers were scared 
because of recent events involving motorcyclists in New York.

On
October 14, seven bikers were arrested after speeding en masse along 
the Long Island Expressway, weaving in and out of traffic and causing 
havoc.

On September 29, a 
pack of motorcyclists dragged a terrified driver out of his Range Rover 
and beat him in fron of his wife and child just off the West Side 
Highway where he had pulled off to try and get away from them.

It later emerged that three off-duty police officers, including an undercover officer, were part of the gang.

Nine people have been arrested in relation to that incident.
