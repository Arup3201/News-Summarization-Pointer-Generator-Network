Peter McAlear, 75, would have to carry a load of gear like spare trousers, underpants and pads

Something as simple as having a cup of tea at a neighbour's house used to be fraught with anxiety for Peter McAlear, 75. And staying overnight at his son's home was all but impossible.

A little under a year ago, Peter underwent treatment on his prostate that left him, like thousands of other men, suffering from incontinence.

'It destroys your confidence,' says Peter, a retired chartered engineer who lives near Glasgow. 

'I'd have to carry a load of gear with me - spare trousers and underpants, as well as pads.

'I'd dread going round to other people's houses. If you sat down on their furniture, there was the worry you might leak.

'I used to stay overnight at my son's home, but then I didn't dare. And a holiday was out of the question.'

It has been isolating for Peter, a father of two and grandfather of three. 'I lost my wife five years ago, and it's important to keep going,' he says.

Urinary problems are often the first sign of prostate cancer. The prostate is a small gland that sits between the bladder and the penis and surrounds the urethra, the tube that carries urine out of the body.

In the early stages, prostate cancer is often symptomless, but as tumours grow, they can press on the urethra and/or the bladder, making men feel the need to go to the loo more frequently or more urgently.

More severe incontinence is a common side-effect of surgery to remove the prostate. Around 5,000 men have this surgery each year and at least half will have short-term incontinence in the months afterwards, says James Catto, a consultant urological surgeon at the University of Sheffield.

Men have two sphincters (rings of muscle acting like a one-way valve) that keep them dry. One between the bladder and the prostate - known as the internal sphincter - and one in the urethra just below the prostate gland.

'These weaken with age, but in some men the prostate enlarges and reduces leakage by acting like a cork in a bottle,' he says.

Removing the prostate (radical prostatectomy) can expose the weak sphincter and lead to incontinence in some men. The internal sphincter sits next to the prostate, so surgery to take out the gland involves removing it, too.

'Men are left relying on the remaining sphincter,' says Professor Catto. 'Many have a degree of incontinence just after surgery because this can be bruised by the operation.'

Incontinence after surgery is usually stress incontinence. Here, leaks occur as extra pressure is put on the bladder, for instance, by coughing or laughing.

In theory, once the bruising has settled down, so will the urinary problems.

However, two in every ten men will have long-term incontinence that leaves them using pads, according to the NHS.

Some, like Peter, are left with no control at all - with a near continual stream from the bladder. This can occur when key muscles and nerves around the bladder are damaged during surgery, so the bladder contracts when it shouldn't.

Mandy Fader, professor of continence technology at Southampton University, says far more needs to be done to support men practically - with better guidance on products that improve quality of life - and psychologically.

It's not only men who have surgery who are at risk - older forms of radiotherapy, using an external beam of radiation, can also lead to incontinence.

New, more focused techniques, such as brachytherapy, which places radioactive seeds in the tumour, are thought to have a much lower risk.

In rare cases, incontinence can be a side-effect of a procedure called TURP (trans urethral resection of the prostate), which is sometimes offered to treat an enlarged prostate, a benign condition thought to affect 60 per cent of men over 60.

TURP involves trimming the prostate to widen the gap for the urethra. Again, this can leave the sphincter damaged - usually temporary, indirect damage from the heat used.

But problems can persist if the sphincter is damaged during the procedure.

Peter's problems were probably triggered by the radiotherapy he had after being diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1999. The treatment worked, and his PSA level (a measure of a protein secreted by the prostate gland, very high levels of which can be caused by cancer) had been 115 when he was diagnosed, but went down to 0.4 - a healthy level.

Though it started to rise again after four years, it was controlled with hormone therapy and regular scans.

Around three years ago, however, Peter started to lose control of his bladder. 'Sometimes, I couldn't make it to the loo in time. Then it started happening all the time,' he says.

Peter mentioned his problems a few times to his urologist, but it was a year before he was offered pills to desensitise his bladder.

These, he says, 'worked too well'. He was hospitalised with a bladder infection as a result of fluid retention, where he wasn't able to pass urine at all.

He was told that the radiotherapy he'd had before had made his prostate less elastic and his urologist suggested he have a TURP procedure. Peter knew this could cause temporary incontinence.

'After a few days, my problems should have settled down - but they didn't,' he says. 'I became totally incontinent. At the hospital, they gave me a pads, but they were not fit for purpose, as they're so big and bulky.

'No one talks to you about what's happening to you.'

But a new research project, led by Professor Fader, is designed to transform the experience of men like Peter. The incontinence management project, as it is known, is part of a wider programme called True NTH, focusing on improving quality of life for men with prostate cancer and funded by the Movember charity campaign.

The first part of the project will be a website offering advice.

'Men can be too embarrassed to ask for this information,' says Professor Fader. 'It's common to see incontinence products for women advertised on telly, but it's still not talked about for men.' Indeed, many end up relying on sanitary pads bought for them by their wives. But these tend to be rectangular - men need a triangular pad.

And there are other products to keep men dry. 'For instance, a clamp (a cushioned clip that fits on the end of the penis to hold the urethra shut) can allow men to exercise for a couple of hours,' says Professor Fader.

There are also sheaths and external bags. These cover the opening of the urethra to collect urine and can be worn inside clothes, strapped to the leg. 'These devices are available on prescription,' says Professor Fader. 'The problem is GPs often don't know this.'

Another option is surgery: to fit an artificial sphincter to keep the urethra closed or a sling that repositions the urethra to take the pressure off the sphincter.

Men taking part in the project will be able to try different devices. They will also be involved in designing new products, including a more comfortable clamp and an absorbent, washable pair of boxers to replace towelling nappies many rely on at night.

And there will be training for health professionals to offer more personal support, including psychological therapies.

Peter is helping the True NTH researchers. Meanwhile thanks to a successful operation to fit an artificial sphincter, he has regained almost total control of his bladder.

'I get the odd leak if I cough,' he says. 'But I can go out again. And I was able to stay at my son's house this Christmas without worrying.'
