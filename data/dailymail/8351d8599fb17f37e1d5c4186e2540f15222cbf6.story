A man whose ribcage was crushing his heart and lungs has been saved after doctors slotted a metal bar through his insides - to fashion a bizarre ‘ribcage brace’.

Dale Hay, 25, was born with the unusual 
Pectus excavatum - a Latin term meaning hollowed 
chest.

But ingenious doctors managed to create a ‘brace’ for his ribcage - a foot-long metal bar, which holds his bones in place, protecting his heart and lungs.

Dale Hay's ribcage was growing inwards, slowly crushing his heart and lungs. Doctors used a foot-long metal bar to hold the bones in place

And three years after having the bar put in place, doctors are now confident that it can now be removed, and Dale’s ribcage will remain normal.

Pub worker Dale, from Atherstone, Warwickshire, said: 'I’ll be really pleased to finally get the bar out, as it can be a bit uncomfortable.

'It protrudes out of my ribcage a bit too, which looks a bit weird - but it has saved my life.

'My mates are always joking that they’re going to sell me off as scrap metal - I don’t know how much they’d get for me though.'

The condition, known as Pectus excavatum - a Latin term for hollowed chest - left him struggling to breathe

Although Dale was born with the condition, it didn't develop until his early teens.

After struggling to understand why 
he was constantly struggling to breathe, Dale tapped his symptoms into 
Google - and diagnosed himself with the unusual condition.

He added: 'I went to my GP and showed him what I’d found on the internet. I expected him to tell me off for looking up symptoms online and trying to diagnose myself, but instead he sent me to a chest expert.

Dale has now been told that he can have the rod removed and is waiting for an operation date

'I had a scan at Heartlands Hospital, in Birmingham, and they said that my chest was very closed in, and if I wasn’t treated, it would crush my heart.

'They told me they would insert a metal rod into my chest to try and separate my ribs, and force them to grow normally.

'It sounded a bit weird, but it was certainly worth it.'

Three and a half years after his original operation, in summer 2010, Dale has now been told that he can have the rod removed.

But he has been let down after the operation was cancelled four times - once when he was in his surgical gown.

Despite the situation, he refuses to criticise staff on wards.

'The staff - the nurses - are brilliant,' he said. 'It seems to be a time management issue.

'The nurses have always been polite and helpful and happy to assist... then they have to deliver the bad news.'

Dr Aresh Anwar, Heartlands’ medical director, said: 'We are extremely sorry that Mr Hay’s operation has had to be rescheduled several times as this is certainly not what we would want for our patients.

Unfortunately, our hospitals currently remain under extreme pressure due to the high number of emergency admissions.'
