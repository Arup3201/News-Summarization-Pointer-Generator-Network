New Yorkers are known for their resilience when trouble comes along - and these fantastic photos show how skaters are still having fun by using their boards on the city’s storm-wrecked streets.

Skateboarder Calvin Nonato took these pictures of his friends skating on a newly-formed ramp in their neighbourhood of Sunnyside in Queens, New York, after a tree pulled up huge concrete slabs.

The amazing photos taken after Superstorm Sandy had struck the city show the thrill-seekers flying through the air on 48 Street and Skillman Avenue after shooting off the top of the concrete blocks.

Mr Nonato, 21, said: ‘My friends and I decided to go out and look for potential new skating spots because there were some new places to skate after last year's storm (Hurricane Irene).

‘Sandy was much crazier though. Many blocks in my neighbourhood are closed because of the trees blocking the road. I saw at least 10 cars that were smashed.

‘But I'm lucky we didn't lose any power here. Many other neighbourhoods by the water got destroyed and also some of our skate-parks.’

Mr Nonato added that many of his friends still don’t have power or mobile phone signal - and some were forced to leave their home because of severe flooding in New York City.

He said: ‘Halloween was ruined for many people because transportation is down and it’s hard to drive around, which is making many people start bringing their bikes out.

'It's a very weird time for New York right now, but this is a little bit of happiness amongst a lot of misery'

‘Most of the trains are down and a lot of people can't go to work. It's a very weird time for New York right now, but this is a little bit of happiness amongst a lot of misery.’

Four days after Superstorm Sandy lashed the US East Coast with high winds and a huge storm surge, frustration has mounted across New York City and well beyond as millions of people remained without power today.

Sandy was blamed for at least 98 deaths in the US and Canada, and left New Jersey's barrier islands a wasteland of eroded shoreline, ruined beachfront homes, flooded streets and damaged utilities.
