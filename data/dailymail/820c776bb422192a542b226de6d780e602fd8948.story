The federal government has appealed to the public to help them invent new hazmat suits for doctors and soldiers fighting the Ebola epidemic in Africa and at home.

The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has sent out an appeal for internet crowdsourcing to design a radical new anti-contamination suit that will lower the risk of health workers becoming infected.

USAID wants applications submitted immediately and any successful design accepted will be awarded $1 million in funding. The USAID has set a deadline of two months on the whole process.

Improvements: The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has sent out an appeal for internet crowdsourcing to design a radical new anti-contamination suit

The USAID has labeled their crowdsourcing scheme, 'Fighting Ebola: A Grand Challenge for Development' as it announced its requirements for their hazmat suits to deal better with tropical heat stress and the risk of contagion when de-suiting.

It did not offer any guidance on current hazmat standards, only requiring 'entirely novel' personal protection equipment.

In addition to suits for those working on the front line of patient protection, the agency issued a demand for suits to be used by airport staff, TSA staff and for those involved in burials.

Current ideas suggested to Sky News to overcome the heat stress of working in a hazmat suit are to equip them with cooling devices, stress detectors and thinner, stronger suits.

The USAID is also looking for suits that provide face cooling shields and suits that are designed to be reusable. 

Many of the personal protection suits are usable one-time only and when they are thrown away they increase the risk of accidental contamination.

This comes as the Illinois Attorney General's office said it is aware that members of the public are being sent email scams directly related to the Ebola crisis.

The emails promise to provide an Ebola 'surplus personal protection kit' costing $29 which will provide 'infection defense for emergency response teams,' says the bogus email.

'People being quarantined,' one subject line reads. 'Ebola outbreak pandemic update,' says another.

'We suspect these emails are the handiwork of scammers seeking to take advantage of people’s understandable fear and anxiety surrounding this international public health risk,' Attorney General Lisa Madigan said in a statement.

Across the nation, American hospitals have increased Ebola training sessions as health workers are placed on high alert for potential cases of the deadly virus in the U.S.

At the University of Chicago Hospital on Monday, doctors practiced pulling on bulky white suits and helmets that make them look more like astronauts than doctors preparing to fight a deadly disease.

However training sessions on Ebola preparedness for U.S. medics and health workers heading to Africa can make the reality sink in - learning how to safely put on and take off the medical armor is crucial.

'When you're in the real deal, remember to take your time,' biosafety expert John Bivona told doctors during a course this week in Chicago. Suits splashed with patients' vomit or blood must be removed carefully, he explained.

'As much as possible, grab from the inside' to avoid touching contaminated parts of the suits, he said. 'Be liberal with disinfectant.'

Across town, at Rush University Medical Center, doctors got a frightening test run this past weekend when a man coughing up blood said he had been in contact with someone from Nigeria, one of the countries in West Africa where Ebola spread.

ER staffers donned protective gear and immediately escorted him to a nearby isolation room, but tests showed he had bronchitis, not Ebola, said Dr. Dino Rumoro, Rush's emergency medicine chief.

Rumoro said he's worked through similar scary disease threats - AIDS, SARS, swine flu and smallpox after 9/11 - that were in some ways more worrisome because they can spread invisibly through the air. Ebola is transmitted through direct contact with blood, vomit and other body fluids, or contact with needles, syringes or other objects contaminated by the virus.

'At least with Ebola we have a fighting chance,' Rumoro said, 'because I know that it is coming from body fluid and I know if I wear my (protective) suit I'm safe and I know if I don't stick myself with a needle or cut myself with a scalpel I'm safe.'

'There's always going to be a little bit of fear in your head,' Rumoro said. 'But that's OK. That's what keeps us safe.'
