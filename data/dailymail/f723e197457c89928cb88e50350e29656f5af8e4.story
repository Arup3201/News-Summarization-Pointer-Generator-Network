Mary Creagh, MP for Wakefield, obtained evidence which suggest contaminated horse meat may have entered the food chain

An investigation has been launched after claims a farming family bred and ate one of their own horses which was not fit for human consumption. 

The horse is believed to have been butchered in the UK and should have gone to France.

But instead the meat from the carcass was sent to two farms - one in Kirklees, West Yorkshire, and another in Chorley, Lancashire. 

Food safety officials say the horse had been injected with phenylbutazone, a drug commonly used to treat inflammation in horses, and should never have been eaten before the test results came back.

They also say the banned meat was sent back to the horse's original owner, a farmer in Kirklees, where it was eaten.

The owners of the two farms are believed to be related. 

Mary Creagh, MP for Wakefield, obtained the information after asking the Secretary of State for Environment Food and Rural Affairs what happened to carcasses which tested positive for phenylbutazone in 2012.  

The reply given was that most of the contaminated horse meat was shipped to France, but one carcass was divided up and sent to two farms in the North of England.

In a written Parliamentary answer, health minister Anna Soubrey said the Food Standards Agency had contacted the relevant local authorities as soon as it realised the food was contaminated - believed to be in September 2012.

But she said when environmental health officials visited the farm in question, they were told the meat had been 'purchased for personal consumption - and had already been consumed.'

A spokesman at Kirklees Council added: 'We were notified by the Food Standards Agency that contaminated meat had been present at one farm in the area.

'On investigating, we established that the meat had already been eaten.'

The shocking news comes only weeks after a nationwide scandal of horse meat found in supermarket burgers.

The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is under pressure to begin testing a much wider range of beef products following revelations that contamination goes far wider than originally believed.

It emerged last week that pies and pasties supplied to UK prisons as halal beef actually contained pork, which is contrary to Muslim religious laws.

The FSA has been put in charge of handling Britain’s investigation into the contamination of beef products with horse meat and pork.

Phenylbutazone, or 'bute' is an anti-inflammatory drug which is regularly given to horses to treat lameness, pain and fever.

It is the most commonly used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory in equine practice.

Bute is banned from entering the human food chain in the EU because it can cause cancer and other lethal effects.

Horses that have been treated with it should have the information 
recorded on their passport, but Labour claim the issuing of such 
documents is fragmented in the UK, where there are 75 approved issuing 
organisations and no national database to track the information.

The Food Standards Agency tests to see that horses in slaughterhouses 
are fit for consumption and carries out further checks on the meat later
down the line.

Ms Creagh has appealed for reassurances that the meat is safe and that regular checks are taking place. 

'The public must have confidence that the food they buy is properly labelled, legal and safe,' she said.

The Food Standards Agency insisted there was no risk to the public and that none of the meat had been placed for sale in the UK.

In a statement it said: 'Horses treated with bute are not allowed to enter the food chain.

'The FSA carries out checks in slaughterhouses to ensure that horses presented for slaughter are fit for human consumption.

'In 2012, the FSA identified five cases where horses returned non-compliant results. None of the meat had been placed for sale on the UK market.'

Figures this week revealed that nearly 10,000 horses were killed and butchered for their meat in British abattoirs last year. 

Just over 150 were tested for 'bute' with nine coming back positive.
