Four Greenpeace activists were hurt, one of them badly, when the Spanish navy rammed their dinghy during a protest, the environmental group said.

One 23-year-old woman had to be airlifted to hospital after her leg was broken, and another activist had to be treated for cuts and bruises following the dawn clash off the Canary Islands.

Video footage of the confrontation taken by Greenpeace shows Spanish navy high-speed boats ramming the activists' dinghies as they approach an oil drilling ship.

Confrontation: A Greenpeace activist is rescued from the sea after she is thrown overboard during a clash between environmental campaigners and the Spanish navy in the waters off the Canary Islands

'It's another reminder of the lengths governments will go to protect the oil industry from peaceful protesters,' Greenpeace said in a statement.

The navy disputed the environmentalists' account, saying had it dispatched two boats to prevent Greenpeace from boarding the large oil drilling ship.

The activist was seriously injured when she fell out of her dinghy and was hit by its propellers, the navy said.

Speaking to The Associated Press by radio-telephone from Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise, Captain Joel Stewart identified the badly hurt woman as a 23-year-old Italian activist.

The other three other injuries were minor, he said.

The navy told the AP it rushed the badly hurt activist to a Spanish hospital in a helicopter.

Greenpeace's statement said: 'The 23 year old Italian who was knocked overboard and had her leg broken, has been taken to a hospital on shore by a navy helicopter, and is in good condition. Another activist was treated on board the Arctic Sunrise for minor cuts.

'We're thankful that no one else was seriously injured, and outraged at the unjustified use of force.'

In Madrid, lawmaker Diego Lopez Garrido of Spain's main opposition Socialist party, said he would call defence minister Pedro Morenes to parliament to explain the navy's actions.

Last month, at the Spanish government's request, the Constitutional Court blocked a proposal by the Canary Islands regional government to hold a referendum on oil exploration in waters.

Some residents of the sun-kissed archipelago off north-west Africa fear oil spills could damage their islands, which are one of Europe's tourism magnets and home to an important fishing industry.

The World Wildlife Fund also recently launched a campaign against drilling off the Canaries, which are home to nearly a third of the world's whale and dolphin species.

WWF Spain’s secretary general, Juan Carlos del Olmo, told The Olive Press: 'We’re talking about an area that’s Europe’s richest when it comes to whales and one of the top in the world.'

Oil spills, contamination and loud noises could all threaten their fragile ecosystem, he warned. 

The government licensed the Spanish energy company Repsol YPF SA to begin oil exploration there, and it is doing that now from a large oil drilling ship with a platform.

The navy also dispatched a frigate to the area where the Repsol facility is due to operate.

Greenpeace geologist Julio Barea said today that he believes its oil exploration could cause "grave" environmental damage around the islands.
