A suspicious package has been destroyed at Fremantle Prison after a former inmate contacted police claiming a bomb had been hidden in the building 25 years ago.

The bomb squad were called to the confinement block of the historic Perth prison on Tuesday, where the explosive device was unearthed from underneath the floorboards.

It is suspected the bomb was being stashed away in conjunction with a thwarted mass break out planned in the 80s.

Western Australia police said the area was evacuated while the bomb was destroyed. 

Acting on the tip-off, police discovered a package, reportedly containing gelignite.

While police refused to confirm where their information had come from, they did clarify that the bomb had been destroyed due to its age.

The former prisoner, who is still believed to be locked-up in another prison, told police he had been an inmate of the prison when the bomb was buried underneath the floor. 

The cell had been used as a solitary confinement unit when the prison was functioning, but was later renovated into an art supply and storage room. 

Speaking to the ABC, The prison's executive manager Bevan Beaver said the bomb was not a danger to the public, even though visitors were taken past the cell where the bomb was buried.

'They came down, investigated, found a substance, they buried it, and exploded it,' he said.

'They didn't want to take it away on precaution; they didn't know what it was so they just buried it. It was in a bag, they didn't uncover the bag, they just took [it] as it was, and buried it. 

It has been reported that the bomb may have been linked to the 1988 prisoner riots, where officers were overthrown and the prison was set on fire.

Fremantle Prison operated as a maximum for almost 140 years before it was decommissioned in 1991. 

Daily tours operate out of the prison and it is listed as as one of the top tourist attractions in Perth. 

Since opening to the public in 1992, the prison has seen over three million visitors walk through the doors.
