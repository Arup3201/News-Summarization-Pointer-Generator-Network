NSW Premier Mike Baird said he experimented with cannabis in his youth

Recently appointed NSW Premier Mike Baird has admitted to experimenting with Cannabis during an interview that canvasses his support for legalising the drug.

The devout Christian and father of three, who succeeded former premier Barry O'Farrell in April, said he had used cannabis as a young person but was quick to dismiss it had any part to play in his life - other than as a one-off experiment.

The Premier told the Daily Telegraph in an interview to mark his 100th day since being thrust into the state's top job, 'we've all been young, so I'm not going to deny I did experiment in my youth.'

He made the remark when quizzed about decriminalising the drug for medicinal purposes in NSW, but said his own experience with drug-taking was neither 'pleasant' nor 'regular'.

'It's got nothing to do with this issue anyway.'

Mike Baird supports legalising marijuana in NSW to help people cope with terminal illness

Daniel, pictured with his mother Lucy Haslam, has found relief in cannabis during chemotherapy and a campaign to legalise the drug for terminally ill patients by his parents has more than 188,000 signatures

The premier, and a number of NSW MPs, have given in-principle support for legalising marijuana for terminally ill patients in the state after Mr Baird visited a Tamworth cancer patient.

Daniel Haslam, a 24-year-old, was told in 2010 that he only had months to live but begun taking cannabis as a pain coping mechanism to help him deal with the disease.

He has made vast improvements in his health, his mother - a former head the north west NSWÂ  drug squad said, and she is now asking politicians to legalise the controversial drug.

Mr Baird said he was 'struck with Daniel and the battle he's in' after meeting with him.

'It's heart-wrenching,' he said. 'I've got deep sympathy and empathy with their position.'

Clinical trials of medicinal cannabis could happen in NSW, but Mr Baird is waiting on details about regulation and supply before making any commitments.

Under a private member's bill to be introduced next month by Nationals MP Kevin Anderson, terminally ill people and their carers will be legally able to carry up to 15 grams of cannabis.

Asked if he would support a clinical trial, as proposed by the Australian Medical Association, Mr Baird said 'it may well be something we have to do'.

'I'm open to that,' he told ABC Radio on Thursday.

But Mr Baird is waiting to see details of the bill and whether it will address his concerns about the sale and regulation of the drug.

But if the bill satisfies Mr Baird, it seems likely Daniel and his family won't be forced to break the law for much longer.

'If we can provide relief to them in those circumstance, well, what premier would not want to do that?" Mr Baird said.

NSW Opposition Leader John Robertson said he's willing to work with the government but, like Mr Baird, wanted to see how the bill addresses things such as supply and access before fully endorsing it.

'I'm not writing a blank cheque, but I am very supportive of his notion," he told reporters on last week.

'If marijuana is part of the solution to dealing with those issues as a means of relieving people's pain, then we should be looking at that.'
