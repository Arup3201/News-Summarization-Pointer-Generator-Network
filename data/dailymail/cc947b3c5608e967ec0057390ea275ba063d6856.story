Horrifying footage has emerged of a woman being beaten with sticks and rods by four men.

The woman can be heard crying out in agony as the men thrash her in the grainy clip, which was filmed in Ludhiana in Punjab, northwest India.

She is seen putting her hands out in a vain attempt to block the blows in the footage filmed on a mobile phone.

Attack: Horrifying footage has emerged of a woman being beaten with rods by four men as onlookers watched

Abuse: The woman is seen crying out in pain as the men hit her with the wooden sticks in the clip, which was filmed on a mobile phone

As she moves around trying to avoid the attack the men corner her and hit her at the same time.

The woman, who is said to be from Bihar, had allegedly lent Rs 20,000 (Â£242) to one of the accused.

She claimed that she was attacked because she had asked for her money to be returned.

The video shows an old man and a woman attempting to save her, but they were also attacked and forced to go away.

Even after she falls to the ground the men continue to thrash her.

The woman handed the mobile phone footage to police as evidence and it has now been registered.

'We have identified the accused and they will be arrested soon,' a police officer said.

Last month a probe was launched after 
police were caught on camera beating a woman who complained to them 
about sexual harassment.

Attacks on women have topped the 
national agenda recently since December 2012 when a medical student was 
assaulted and raped by six men on a moving bus.

The attack in the heart of the Indian capital shocked a country often inured to such sexual violence.

It brought hundreds of thousands of 
angry citizens out in the streets to demand more safety for women and 
harsher laws to deter the perpetrators of such acts.
