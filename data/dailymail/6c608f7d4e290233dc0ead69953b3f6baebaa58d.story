As well as fancying himself as a boxer, Wayne Rooney believes he is the finest singer at Manchester United.

Rooney was subjected to an unwanted set of headlines on Sunday after apparently being knocked out by Phil Bardsley during a sparring session in the kitchen of his Cheshire mansion.

The England and United captain did not seem unsettled by the episode, scoring a fine goal in a 3-0 rout of Tottenham and then engaging in some celebratory shadow boxing.

Rooney took part in a 'Chevrolet FC hosts Man Utd in Google+ Hangout' on Monday, which was full of light-hearted exchanges and made no mention of his boxing.

When Rooney, who was sitting between Michael Carrick and Ander Herrera and apparently at Old Trafford, was asked who the best singer is at the club, he replied: 'Probably me.

'Over Christmas a few of the players got up and did a few songs. Quite good some of them. Michael's not bad.' Herrera said of Carrick: 'He's humble, but he's the best.'

The host then asked Rooney what songs he liked to sing. 

'Opera,' Rooney said, before adding: 'Only joking. I like to sing a bit of indie rock.'

There was a slight sneer when it was suggested, tongue in cheek, that Rooney would be asked to sing later in the Hangout, something which did not materialise.

Rooney was asked who his favourite English footballer and hero was growing up.

His answer was Paul Gascoigne, a player who also attracted tabloid attention for his off-field antics as much as his on-field displays.

Rooney added: 'I think he's probably still to this day the greatest English player. For excitement and goals, he was my favourite player.'

Asked what it was specifically about Gascoigne that Rooney liked, he said: 'His ability to turn games round on their head and produce magical moments. He was a perfect entertainer on the pitch.'

A number of other questions were Rooney related.

Told only one player had scored more penalties for United than Rooney, the skipper conferred with Carrick and Herrera before saying: 'We think it's Dennis Irwin.'

Asked how confident they were in their answer on a scale of one to 10? Rooney replied '11'.

But they were wrong. The correct answer was Ruud van Nistelrooy with 28 penalties.

Asked how many he had scored, Rooney said: 'I've no idea.'

The next Rooney related question was about the percentage of his 229 United goals scored at Old Trafford.

'We think 58 (per cent),' Rooney said. The correct answer was 54 per cent.

Rapid fire questions followed for Dwight Yorke, co-hosting the event in London in front of a live audience.

Rooney asked: 'What was the score on your Manchester United debut?'

Yorke was correct in answering a 0-0 draw at West Ham.

Rooney's next question was, 'Can you spell Januzaj backwards?'

Yorke was right, with Rooney saying, 'Yes, well done.'

Asked if it surprised him that Yorke was correct, Rooney said: 'Knowing Dwight the way I do, it actually did surprise me.'
