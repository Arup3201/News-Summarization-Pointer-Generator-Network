Cheaper clothes and shoes have helped bring down the cost of living, new figures show today.

The consumer price index (CPI) rate of inflation fell to 2.5 per cent in August, down from 2.6 per cent in July.

But it was still much higher than increases in pay, which have gone up by just 1.5 per cent year-on-year.

New figures today show the Consumer Prices Index rate of inflation fell to 2.5 per cent in August, down from a peak of 5.2 per cent in September last year but still above the Bank of England's two per cent target

While petrol prices, heating bills and transport costs continue to climb, increases in shopping bills for fashion were down.

Clothing prices rose by 2.8 per cent between July and August compared to a record 3.7 per cent rise a year ago.  Rises were lowest in menswear.

However, the reduction was not enough to offset fears that the Bank of England’s two per cent target inflation will now not be met until 2013.Inflation has been falling since peaking at 5.2 per cent in September last year.

A fall in the rate of clothing price rises helped has helped to bring down the cost of living

A Treasury spokesman said: ‘Inflation coming down is good news for households and business.

‘The rate of CPI inflation has now more than halved since its peak last September, bringing welcome relief to budgets.’

However, there is more grim news for consumers with warnings that droughts in the USA will force up food prices, and energy firms are expected to increase charges in the run up to the winter.

Brendan Barber, TUC General Secretary said: ‘Inflation is not falling fast enough, particularly as wage growth is so anaemic.

‘Real wages have been shrinking for nearly four years now and the prospect of an ease in living standards any time soon looks remote.’
