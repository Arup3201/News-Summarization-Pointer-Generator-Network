While the film is currently topping box offices around the world, former Minnesota gov and Navy SEAL Jesse Ventura has confirmed he will not be seeing American Sniper, saying that Chris Kyle was 'no hero'.

Ventura won a $1.8 million defamation lawsuit last year against the estate of the late Chris Kyle, the SEAL protagonist in the movie.

He said yesterday he will not see the film partly because Kyle 'is no hero' to him.

'A hero must be honorable, must have honor. And you can't have honor if you're a liar. 

'There is no honor in lying,' Ventura told The Associated Press from his winter home in Baja California, Mexico. 

Ventura also dismissed the film as 'propaganda' because it conveys the idea that Iraq had something to do with the 9/11 attacks.

'It's as authentic as 'Dirty Harry,' he said, referring to fictional movie series starring Clint Eastwood, the director of 'American Sniper.'

The film has sparked debate over whether snipers should be considered heroes.

Kyle was killed in February 2013 on a remote shooting range in Texas by a disturbed veteran  said to have been suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.

Ventura was criticised by some for continuing his lawsuit against Kyle's estate following his death.

He filed suit against Kyle's widow, Taya Kyle, who inherited an estimated $6million Kyle had gained from the book.

Ventura claimed Kyle fabricated a subchapter in his 'American Sniper' book, where Kyle claimed he punched a man in a California bar in 2006 for allegedly saying the SEALs 'deserve to lose a few' in Iraq.

Kyle later identified the man as Ventura.

Ventura, who worked as a professional wrestler after leaving the military, said this incident never happened and sued.

After deliberating for nearly six days, a jury in St. Paul, Minnesota, returned a verdict against Kyle's estate - finding that the Ventura had been defamed by Kyle's account.

Publisher HarperCollins removed the passage from the best-seller, and it gets no mention in the movie. 

Kyle's estate has since appealed. Ventura's separate lawsuit against HarperCollins remains pending.

Shortly before his death Kyle defended his story in videotaped testimony, and said the account was accurate. 

Ventura is now working on the second season of his online-only political talk show 'Off the Grid' at Ora.tv, which he records in Mexico, where he lives in a solar-powered home with a satellite Internet connection.

Ed Huddleston, a lawyer for Mrs Kyle, said they won't comment on Ventura's remarks because the lawsuit is on appeal.

The former Marine charged in Kyle's death goes on trial in Texas next month.

The 'American Sniper' film has earned more than $200 million domestically since it was released  on Christmas day.

 It was recently nominated for six Academy Awards, including nods for Best Picture and Best Actor for Bradley Cooper's portrayal of Kyle.

While the movie has been a box office hit, it has also divided opinion, with some criticising the film's 'jingoistic' stance.

Critics of the movie included talk show host Bill Maher, who claimed the film is only cleaning up at the box office because audiences lap up its 'psychopath' hero.

Speaking on his HBO show Real Time with Bill Maher, he drew on excerpts from the autobiography Kyle wrote before he was killed in February 2013, in which he said he enjoyed war and referred to his targets as 'savages'. 

The film tells the story of Kyle, who was raised in rural Texas and started out working as a cowboy.

He applied to join the SEALs but was turned down because a rodeo accident had left him with metal pins in his arms.

However, in the late Nineties the unit relaxed its entrance requirements and Kyle was put through the fearsomely tough selection and training regime.

In 2003, he was deployed to Iraq where he made his first long-distance kills even though he had not been trained as sniper.

Spotting his obvious talent, the military sent him to SEAL sniper school, where he was taught how to perform the controversial job.

In 2004 Kyle was posted to Fallujah in west Baghdad, a major battleground of Iraqi insurgency - and it was during the battle for the city where he first made his mark.

However, it was in 2006 in Ramadi, a city in central Iraq, that Mr Kyle gained his nickname as 'The Legend' from his fellow SEALs.

One day, while positioned on a roof, Kyle watched a moped coming down a street. Riding it were two men, one of whom dropped a backpack into a pothole.

Realising that it contained an improvised explosive, Kyle took a shot at the speeding moped from a range of 150 yards. The bullet hit one of the riders, passed through him, and hit the other.

In 2009, after four tours of Iraq, Kyle retired. 

The most lethal sniper in U.S. military history, Kyle had 160 confirmed kills and also gained himself a chestful of medals, including three Silver Stars for gallantry.
