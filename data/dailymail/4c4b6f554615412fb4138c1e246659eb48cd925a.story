Actress Victoria Rowell is suing CBS and Sony, claiming that they refused to re-hire her on soap opera The Young And The Restless because she publicly reprimanded them over a lack of racial diversity on the show.

Rowell, 55, joined the cast of the show as Drucilla Barber Winters in 1990. But she claims that experiences of racial discrimination on set led to her 'reluctantly' leaving in 2007 after starring in 2,000 episodes.

In 2010, Rowell, from Maine, approached the show – made by Sony and broadcast by CBS – in the hope that her role could be reprised, or that her character could appear on sister production The Bold And The Beautiful.

However, she claims that she was denied re-employment and blackballed ‘because of her public appeals to hire more African Americans in front of and behind the camera’, according to a statement.

It said: 'She knew she was being impoverished and blackballed because she had chosen to speak out against discrimination and injustice that she had endured and witnessed happen to other African Americans.'

Last year, for example, she wrote on Twitter: ‘Young & Restless on air for 40 years, loyally watched by their absolute competitive-edge audience (blacks) & not one black Exec Producer?’

Her attorney Cyrus Mehri said: ‘All Ms Rowell is seeking is basic fairness. We are confident that Ms Rowell will be rehired if the issue is considered in a serious and non-retaliatory manner.

'Ms Rowell made Drucilla Winters one of the most compelling characters ever to appear on daytime television. In refusing to re-employ her, the defendants aren’t just hurting Ms Rowell, they’re acting against their own economic self-interest.’

Ms Rowell said: ‘The Young And The Restless holds such a special place for the millions of viewers who tune in to watch these characters every day. It’s unfortunate that the cast and crew do not reflect this diverse audience. 

'The character Drucilla was popular because she represented a positive role model for African Americans and audiences need to have that represented in their favorite shows.’

Rowell claims in the suit that ‘racial discrimination is blatant at The Young And The Restless’, pointing out that as of 2010, over 100 writers had been used, but not one was African American.

The suit claims that the defendants’ retaliation 'has caused substantial financial and monetary harm to Ms Rowell', forcing her to ‘tap into employee benefits’ - and caused 'mental anguish'.

When MailOnline asked Ms Rowell whether she was confident of winning the case, she explained that throwing the spotlight on the perceived issue was victory in itself.

She said: 'As for winning, I have won, exposing this unacceptable racist and retaliatory behavior in 21st century America.' 

CBS, quoted by People.com, said: ‘We were disappointed to learn that, after leaving the cast of The Young and the Restless on her own initiative, Ms Rowell has attempted to rewrite that history through lawyers' letters and a lawsuit that has no merit. We harbor no ill will toward Ms. Rowell, but we will vigorously defend this case.’

Rowell received 11 NAACP Image Awards and two Daytime EMMY nominations for her role as Drucilla.
