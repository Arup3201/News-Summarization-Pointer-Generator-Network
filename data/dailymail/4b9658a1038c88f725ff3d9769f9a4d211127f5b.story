Scottish nationalists are preparing to form a secret intelligence service in the style of MI5 once independence is secured, it has emerged.

With Scotland preparing for a vote on separation in 2014, ministers have indicated that an independent country would require its own 'McMI5' spy agency.

And security analysts believe such spymasters will target the brightest minds at St Andrews University, where Prince William and Kate Middleton studied, for the James Bonds of the future.

Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said she expects that an 'independent domestic intelligence machinery' would be set up post-independence.

But during a visit to Glasgow last week, the Home Secretary Theresa May said that if Scotland were to become a separate state it would not be guaranteed to have access to intelligence on terrorism and organised crime from the UK.

She warned that as a new country, Scotland would have to gain trust before it could expect to share sensitive information.

'The point is that if Scotland is separate it becomes a separate state. So it is not the same as sharing intelligence across the UK,' she said.

Stuart Crawford, a defence and 
security analyst, told the Sunday Times: 'Intelligence needs the brightest and the best, 
and that's what you can get from the top universities such as St Andrews
 or Edinburgh.

'I know a 
number of senior academics who work as talent spotters for the security 
services and this is how any new agency in a post-independence Scotland 
would operate.'

The Scottish MI5 may recruit spies from students at St Andrews' university, it has been claimed

But the plans have been criticised by former top MI6 officer who warned that
 an independent Scotland could not rely on the ‘umbrella’ of Britain’s 
security agencies.

Baroness Margaret ‘Meta’ Ramsay said the SNP needs to ‘think again’ if 
it believes intelligence from MI6, MI5 and the UK’s communications 
headquarters, GCHQ, would be shared.

The Labour peer – once tipped as a future head of the Secret 
Intelligence Service – also questioned whether Nationalist ministers 
‘realise the magnitude’ of providing Scotland with its own domestic 
security body to replace MI5, not to mention an external agency to 
replace MI6.

Her comments came after Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was 
challenged on the issue at a recent meeting of Westminster’s foreign 
affairs committee.

Miss Sturgeon struggled to outline the SNP’s plans and claimed there 
would still be ‘very close intelligence sharing with the rest of the 
UK’.

MPs on the committee outlined the huge cost of gathering security data. 
The UK government is spending £650million to upgrade its systems to cope
 with the growing threat of ‘cyber-terrorism’.

The work of 14,000 UK diplomatic staff in 270 offices around the world 
would also come to an end post-independence, with the Scottish 
Government forced to set up its own embassies. Establishing just 100 
outposts has been estimated to cost around £1billion.

Baroness Ramsay, a Glasgow University graduate who went on to become a 
case officer with MI6, was head of station in Helsinki, Finland. She 
left the intelligence service for politics and was foreign policy 
adviser to John Smith, Labour leader from 1992 to 1994.

In an opinion piece published yesterday, Baroness Ramsay wrote: ‘It can 
never be assumed that diplomatic or historic friendships will result in 
any intelligence liaison, other than the most basic and low grade, until
 credentials have been established. Of course, it is not impossible to 
begin a new security service, but it has to be realistically recognised 
that it demands considerable resources both human and financial.'

Asked at the recent committee meeting if Scotland would expect to be 
able to read the rest of the UK’s secret intelligence, Miss Sturgeon 
replied: ‘Scotland and the rest of the UK share an island. It would be 
not just in Scotland’s interest for there to be very close 
intelligence-sharing with the rest of the UK. It would clearly be in the
 interest of the rest of the UK as well.’

A Scottish Government spokesman said last night: ‘The UK Government has 
recently offered to share intelligence with Algeria, so if that is in 
its interests it will be overwhelmingly in the interests of the rest of 
the UK to share intelligence with counterparts in an independent 
Scotland.’
