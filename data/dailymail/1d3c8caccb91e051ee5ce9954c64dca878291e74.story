Ronny Deila believes Celtic may never again sign a first-team player from the English top flight due to the unprecedented sums of money flooding into the Barclays Premier League.

The game south of the Border was further enriched this week with news of a three-year deal worth over £5bn being brokered with Sky and BT from 2016-17.

With the Scottish game earning around £15m per season from broadcasters, the huge disparity in resources between clubs like Burnley and Celtic is widening.

Ronny Deila has revealed he struggles to compete against Premier League clubs for signings 

Deila insisted that he found some English games ‘boring’ in comparison to what’s going on in Scotland but he realises that the days when his club plundered the likes of Chelsea for Chris Sutton are unlikely to be witnessed again.

‘There are two ways to get players. One, they are Scottish and they want to come back and play for Celtic or other teams in Scotland. Or two, they are young and need to play,’ Deila said.

‘But if they are an established player at Chelsea there are grades where they will go, and we are not even the next one down. They will go to somewhere like Southampton, maybe then West Bromwich Albion and then even the Championship, because the money there is much better than at Celtic.’

Asked if there was any point in now deploying scouts to watch first-team games at the top end of the English game, Deila replied: ‘Yes, for the youngsters. But Willian, Costa … I don’t think they will come.

‘There has to be a special reason — maybe players between the ages of 15 and 25 and again they have to have some relation to Celtic.

‘Maybe they are Irish, someone who loves Celtic and has a dream to play for Celtic. We need to bring up our own and then they go out, and we bring them back again. That is possible I think.’

Intimidating though the latest TV deal down south is, Deila maintains it only has limited relevance for Scottish football.

England may virtually be a no-go area now as far as signing ready-made talents is concerned but the Norwegian sees no barriers to Scottish clubs rearing their own.

Martin Odegaard, who played for Deila at Stromgodset aged 15, has just joined Real Madrid and the Celtic manager feels there could be other such talents within Scotland.

‘Martin Odegaard is a once in every 10 years players in Europe. I have seen very good players but he is very special at that level,’ he added.

‘But Messi can come from Scotland if you believe in it. You have to develop him like Messi and that is not about results. It is about making him into a complete football player.

‘If I tell my players they have to give the ball back to the midfield because they can’t take the ball with their back to the goal then they will never play for a Liverpool or whatever.

Real Madrid were able to entice Norway international Martin Odegaard to the Santiago Bernabeu in January  

‘You should never give young players boundaries. I have told my first-team players if they make a mistake with a pass I couldn’t care less.

‘As long as you work hard, mistakes will happen. If they make a mistake I will never have a go at them because they have to have freedom on the pitch so they learn.’

Despite being financially hamstrung, Deila feels there is much to commend the Scottish game for compared with much of what he’s witnessed in England.

‘Scottish football has so much enthusiasm,’ he added.

‘I don’t think too much about money. It is important for fans to understand the English clubs are getting more money and we have no chance to compete with budgets. But we can be better at other things that doesn’t cost money like developing players and people.

‘I think we should be more proud of it (the game in Scotland). The interest here is phenomenal. It is something special.

‘When you go to Celtic games away, the fans are fantastic.

‘I have been many times to England and I am bored compared with what’s happening here in the stands sometimes.

‘The game against Rangers is special. They don’t have that.

‘I have been at United, Arsenal, Liverpool, Tottenham and it’s not near the atmosphere there was in that game.’

Deila has said the atmosphere at the likes of Manchester United and Arsenal does not rival the Old Firm derby
