There used to be an unremarkable gravestone in a garden in Windsor etched with the line 'Here lies Joy' - but behind that simple sentence is a truly remarkable story that stretches back to the early 20th century and across hundreds of miles to Russia.

The grave was the final resting place not of a human, but a spaniel – who belonged to the son of Russia’s last monarch, Tsar Nikolai II Romanov. He was executed in Ipatiev House, along with his wife, Empress Alexandra, five children and four servants by revolutionary communist forces on 17 July 1918 in Yekaterinburg.

How Joy came to be buried in England, in the shadow of Windsor Castle, is a story that’s not even very well known among Russian historians.

Crown Prince Alexei with Joy, whose fate remained a mystery for many years

Joy was much-loved by Alexei, who was killed at the age of 13 by Bolshevik forces

Joy was a constant companion to Tsar Nikolai’s son, 13-year-old Crown Prince Alexei, and it was thought for a long time that he was shot dead by a Bolshevik execution squad that wanted no trace of the Romanov family left, as they were perceived to have been responsible for many of Russia’s problems at the time.

However, it turns out that while two other dogs the royal family owned were shot dead, one of the soldiers in the execution squad took pity on Joy and allowed him to live.

The soldiers had to retreat, but on their return to the house eight days later found Joy running around the yard in a malnourished state, according to The Siberian Times.

Joy was eventually homed with Colonel Pavel (Paul) Rodzianko, who was serviing with the British Expeditionary Force in Siberia, according to the paper.

The British were expelled from Russia by the Bolsheviks and Rodzianko had grown so fond of Joy that he took him back to England.

He wrote in his book Tattered Banners: ‘With heavy hearts we sailed away from Vladivostok. Joy, the little ill-named spaniel who had seen his master murdered, that fateful night, travelled with me. I have never seen Russia again.'

Joy was given a home somewhere on Clewer Hill Road in Windsor, where he saw out the rest of his days in comfort.

It's thought that the garden has now made way for a car park.
