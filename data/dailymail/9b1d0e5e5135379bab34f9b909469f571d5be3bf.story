Jordan Rhodes shrugged off the fierce speculation over his future by snatching an injury-time winner for Blackburn at Ewood Park.

This derby was drifting towards a goalless draw when Tom Cairney sent over a corner with 15 seconds remaining of the four added minutes. Doneil Henry flicked on and Rhodes stuck out a boot to score his 14th goal of the season from close range.

It was an amazing finish after 48 hours of questions about the possibility of the striker leaving Blackburn.

Middlesbrough have offered to take Rhodes to the Riverside on loan for the rest of the season with a view to signing him permanently for a fee of £8million, potentially rising to £10m.

Their Championship promotion rivals Derby, Norwich, Sheffield Wednesday and Nottingham Forest have also registered an interest in Blackburn’s record £8m signing who still has four-and-a-half years left on his contract at Ewood.

But having rejected a £12m offer from Hull City last summer, Blackburn’s owners Venky’s are reluctant to sell while their club still have an outside chance of reaching the playoffs following this win, as well as the prospect of a FA Cup quarter-final replay with Liverpool next month.

Asked if he has been given assurances that Rhodes will not be sold, manager Gary Bowyer replied: ‘Yes, it just wouldn’t add up. Why would you loan out your top goalscorer? My five-year-old nephew might be able to work that one out.

‘I can’t answer on behalf of Middlesbrough but Jordan has just scored the winner and he will be starting at Charlton on Saturday.

‘He just handles the speculation enormously well. I was quietly confident of him scoring tonight, to be perfectly honest, because that’s what he does when there’s all the talk.’

Bowyer described this as Blackburn’s best win of the season after the physical and mental energy his players exerted in Sunday’s goalless draw with Liverpool at Anfield.

They lost Corry Evans and Markus Olsson to injury in the first-half but Ben Marshall should have put them ahead in stoppage time when he headed over from Craig Conway’s cross.

Substitute Craig Davies wasted Bolton’s best chance when he raced clear only to shoot straight at Jason Steele, and Rhodes should have scored with a 79th -minute header from close-range before making amends at the death.

Conceding another yet another late goal was a sickener for Bolton who are still not free of relegation danger.

‘It’s unacceptable,’ said manager Neil Lennon. ‘That’s five games in the last month and it’s cost us seven points. We’d be home and hosed but we still have a bit of work to do.

‘If we can’t defend a set-piece in the last 30 seconds of the game… the players aren’t learning so we’ve got some work to do to make them mentally stronger because it’s obviously a psychological thing.

‘You think it can’t happen again then lo and behold it does. I’m lost for words.’
