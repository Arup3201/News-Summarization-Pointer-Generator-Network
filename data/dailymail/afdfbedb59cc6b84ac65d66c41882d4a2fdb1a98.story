One of North America's rarest birds has fought back from the brink of extinction and is enjoying a renaissance - on a rocky outcrop used by the US Navy as a firing range.

The San Clemente Island loggerhead shrike is thriving on the rocky outcrop off the Californian coast, known as the 'boom box'.

In the 90s its numbers had dwindled to just seven breeding pairs, but now there are believed to be 70 on the island.

It is a remarkable success story given the black, grey and white songbird shares its home with an area that is regularly bombed by US Navy battleships.

The Navy itself has claimed credit for the shrikes survival after it launched aÂ  $3-million-a-year captive breeding programme to protect the threatened species, according to a report in the Telegraph.

Where once the volcanic island was pitted with craters, the investment programme has allowed native plants to be reintroduced, such as the Channel Island tree mallow.

Vital work: Wildlife biologist Melissa Booker is helping to protect a variety of endangered species on San Clemente Island

Navy biologist Melissa Booker said: 'The shrike seems to be unaffected by the loud noises.

Ms Booker added: 'Some places that 
resembled cratered moonscapes are now covered with native shrubs so 
thick it's hard to wade through them.'

Snipers have been told to the nests of 
endangered birds, such as the shrike. The nests of western snowy plovers
have even been moved out of the way of tanks.

Aid: The US Navy injects $3million each year to help protect the wildlife on the island, such as the shrike

Saved: Botanists have prevented the Channel Island tree mallow from being wiped out on San Clemente Island too

San Clemente Island
fox numbers have also bounced back from just a few hundred 10 years ago to about 1,100

And the Navy is now trying to get the San Clemente night 
lizard taken off the endangered species list, after numbers increased.

According to the Pentagon, $73 million was spent on protecting more than 400 species across an area of 28 million acres last year. They are making the investment to avoid possible confrontations with conservationists.

Commander Christopher Kirby, the officer in charge of San Clemente, said: 'If we were to abuse the island, we would lose it.'Noah Greenwald of the Center for Biological Diversity, said: 'They're doing some good things for endangered species, which is great, but there are activities that are really damaging to the environment at the same time.'
