A man has been jailed after crashing his car and killing his girlfriend while driving at 'vastly excessive speeds'.

Daniel Day was sentenced to nearly three years in prison after losing control of his partner Alice Hicks' car on a country road at 80mph.

She was a passenger in the convertible Mini-cooper and was thrown from the car when he crashed into another vehicle driving in the opposite direction.

Day, 34, denied causing death by dangerous driving but was found guilty by a jury at Taunton Crown Court after just 40 minutes of deliberations.

'Reckless': Daniel Day, 34 (left), has been jailed for causing death by dangerous driving following the smash that killed his girlfriend Alice Hicks, 27 (right)

The court heard that neither Day nor 
Miss Hicks, 27, were wearing seatbelts at the time of the collision 
which happened on September 24 2011.

He was speeding along the A38 near Rooksbridge, Somerset, when the road was blocked by a van that was waiting to turn right.

Witnesses described how Day had 
little or no chance of stopping behind the stationary traffic and he 
swerved to avoid the van but hit a Mazda on the other side of the road.

'Deep grief': The trainee accountant's father Raymond Hicks said the family will 'never recover' from Alice's death

Lucy Fulford, a passenger in anther 
car driving in the opposite direction, said: The speed shocked me. I saw
the driver, he looked panicked. His arms were rigid and his eyes were 
wide. I smelt rubber.'

Miss Hicks suffered head injuries after being thrown from the car and died the next day.

After Day was found guilty Miss Hicks' mother Yvonne, 59, a receptionist, described her daughter as 'the centre of the family'.

She said: 'We
all miss her terribly, she was the centre of our lives, she did so much
for us all. We now need to think of all the happy times that we all had together.'

Her father Raymond, 79, added: 'We are 
pleased that Daniel Day, who drove Alice to her death, has received 
punishment for the way in which he drove her car.

'Nothing
will replace her and we will never recover from losing her in a 
completely unnecessary accident caused by his criminally irresponsible 
driving.

'It’s about 
time that UK law recognised that a motor vehicle in the hands of an 
irresponsible driver is as lethal as a gun or knife.'

Miss
Hicks' father added that his daughter had been months away from 
graduating from an accountancy course at Weston College in 
Weston-super-Mare.

The retired BT national sales training manager said: 'She died in the September but was due to graduate the following June.

'I had saved my cap and gown for her and she was going to wear it to the ceremony. It is still laid out on her bed.'

Tragedy: The trial heard Day approached the blind bend in his girlfriend's convertible Mini Cooper at up to 80mph (file photo)

In a letter to Recorder Jeremy Wright, Day expressed his remorse and said: 'I will never forgive myself'.

In
excerpts read out by the judge, he said: 'I have so much guilt and no 
respect for myself. I have brought terrible suffering to her family and 
shame to my family.'

Mr Hicks said he believes swifter action should be taken against dangerous drivers.

'Where
responsibility is clear the individual should be arrested immediately, 
and their driving licence and passport removed,' he said.

'While
all Alice’s family were suffering in deep grief, particularly on the 
anniversary of her death and over two Christmases, Daniel Day was 
allowed to spend the time in the bosom of his family.

'A review of the law relating to driving offences is urgently required.'
