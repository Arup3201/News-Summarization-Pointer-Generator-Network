Liverpool are in talks over a deal to sign former Barcelona goalkeeper Victor Valdes.

Valdes is a free agent after his release from his boyhood club this summer but, after suffering a cruciate ligament injury in March, the ex-Barca No 1 will not be fit until December.

The 32-year-old Catalan keeper would provide cover for Brendan Rodgers' first-choice in goal, Simon Mignolet.

Valdes had been set for a move to mega-rich French side Monaco, but his injury put paid to the move.

Rodgers had originally planned to move for Alex McCarthy from Reading, but the highly-rated England keeper has joined QPR for £6million.

Valdes is a legend at the Nou Camp after keeping goal for over 500 matches for the La Liga giants, winning three Champions League finals and six La Liga titles.

Liverpool were impressive during a 3-0 demolition of Tottenham at White Hart Lane on Sunday. Raheem Sterling, Steven Gerrard and Alberto Moreno all scored while Mario Balotelli impressed on his debut.

Mignolet also proved his worth to Rodgers with a stunning save from a thunderous volley by Nacer Chadli. 

But the arrival of Valdes would ensure the Belgian had serious competition for the No 1 jersey at Anfield.
