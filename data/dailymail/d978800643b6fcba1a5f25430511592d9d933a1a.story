She's one of the world's most famously slender royals but it seems even Queen Letizia isn't averse to whittling down her curves with an illusion dress.

The Spanish royal took to the stage at a Spanish cultural awards show wearing one of the famously slimming frocks, which work by tricking the eye with blocks of colour.

Joined by husband King Felipe, 47, the mother-of-two was all smiles as she arrived at the El Pardo Palace for the event.

Although the ceremony took place on Sunday, officially a day off for the busy Spanish royal couple, the pair were all smiles as they handed out certificates to those deemed to have made a significant contribution to Spain's cultural life over the last year.

Both Letizia, a former journalist, and Felipe are famous for championing Spanish culture, with Letizia even flying to Vienna last October to open an exhibition dedicated to Diego Velázquez.

Velázquez, who was born in 1599, is best known for his 1656 work, Las Meninas, which is usually housed in Madrid's Prado Museum.

The painting, which shows Infanta Margarita Teresa surrounded by her maids of honour and servants, was commissioned by Felipe IV - an ancestor of the current King Felipe. 

Happy: The royal pair appeared to be on cheerful form, despite giving up a Sunday at home

Chic: Queen Letizia looked wonderful in her dress, while Felipe was dapper in a grey pinstripe suit

Supporters: The Spanish royal couple are enthusiastic champions of Spanish culture

On her travels: So enthused by Spanish culture is Letizia, she even travels abroad to promote it

The National Culture Awards came at the end of yet another busy week for the Spanish royal couple, who, on Thursday, attended an event celebrating a very different slice of Spanish culture - the wine. 

During their visit to Freixenet Winery in the village of Sant Sadurni d'Anoia in north-eastern Spain, the pair posed next to a barrel of Cava wine that they had autographed during a previous trip. 

Freixenet, a global leader in traditionally-made quality sparkling wines, is celebrating the 100-year anniversary of its first Cava (sparkling white or rose wine).

The company is run by the same family that produced the first bottle one century ago, and remains a leader in exports, selling 150 million bottles in more than 140 countries all over the world.

Guests at the event included Esperanza Aguirre - a Spanish politician and former President of Madrid - and the Peruvian writer, Mario Vargas Llosa. 

The style chameleon wore her hair up for a change, twisted into a low plaited bun, as she enjoyed a tipple with her husband and honorary president of Spanish winery Freixenet, Jose Luis Bone
