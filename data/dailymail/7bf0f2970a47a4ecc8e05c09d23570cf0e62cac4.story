These heart-warming pictures show the moment a baby giraffe came down to earth with quite a bump after its mother gave birth.

Two friendly giraffes stood guard from hyenas as the mother spent 30 minutes patiently waiting for the birth.

Slowly but surely the calf begins to emerge, with the mother momentarily dropping to all fours before standing straight again, causing the baby to fall around six feet on to its back.

Following its ungraceful entrance to the world, the calf, which spent around 15 months in the womb, lifts its head up moments later as its mother looks down on her newborn.

Just minutes later, the mother's two friends come over to see the baby, watching as the giraffe begins to lovingly lick its offspring clean.

One of the mother's friends even bends down to help, as the calf begins to perk up and take in the world for the first time.

As the newborn quickly discovers, taking your first steps is never easy, as it stumbles around and falls over several times.

Eventually the calf gets to its feet and tentatively edges its way towards its mother for a feed.

Later the baby was seen plodding carefully around, its mother following behind as it tried to continue preening the playful calf.

Loving: As the calf raises its head and takes in its first view of the outside world, the mother bends down to to tend to her newborn, tenderly nudging its head

Friends: Another giraffe, which had been standing guard, wanders over to inspect the new calf as the mother starts licking her offspring clean

Speaking of the moment of birth, Mr Knausenberger, 32, from Germany, said: 'It was so special - I've never seen anything like this before.'

Baby steps: The calf stumbles and its short legs quiver as it tries to get to its feet for the first time, failing at several attempts to do so

Tour operator Andreas Knausenberger, 32, captured the miracle of birth after stumbling on it by accident during a safari in the Masai Mara National Reserve, Kenya.

He spoke of the moment he and his tour group spotted the giraffe giving birth: 'It was so special - I've never seen anything like this before,' he said.

'When we approached the giraffes we noticed something dark hanging out of one of their backs and we immediately realized she was in labour.

'Not to disturb them, we waited a good distance away and it was really interesting to watch the others guard the one in labour as there were some hyenas sniffing around.'

'After about 30 minutes the baby came out bit by bit and finally fell about two metres on to its back,' Mr Knausenberger, from Extrakt Exclusiv Travel, said.

'Only 15 seconds later, the new-born lifted its head and the mother started cleaning it carefully.

'After another half an hour - and several failed attempts - the baby finally managed to get up on its long feet and started looking for milk.'

Success: After just half an hour in the outside world, the calf eventually clambers to its feet and tries to take its first steps in the Kenyan safari

And we're off: The calf, which spent 15 months in its mothers womb, carefully plods along as its mother tries to keep up with and continue preening it
