Ever wondered who can find out where you are and discover what you’re doing by looking at your mobile data?

The answer, according to security researcher, Brendan O’Connor, is just about anyone.

That is, anyone, who has access to a Raspberry Pi Model A computer, a few over-the-counter sensors and a plastic box.

With $57 (£37) Mr O’Connor managed to create a device, named ‘creepyDOL’, which can track the movement of everyone on the street.

He then connected each of the boxes to a command and control system, and constructed a data visualisation system to monitor what the sensors picked up.

‘Actually it’s not hard,’ said Mr O’Connor in a New York Times interview. ‘It’s terrifyingly easy.’

‘It could be used for anything depending on how creepy you want to be,’ he said.

Mr O’Connor found that he could pick up the websites he browsed when he connected to a public Wi-Fi.

He got the unique identifier connected to his mobile and managed to get huge amounts of unencrypted information about where he had been.

When he wasn’t connect to a Wi-Fi network, his sensors were still able to track his location through Wi-Fi ‘pings.’

A ping test is used to determine whether your device can communicate with another system over the network.

The CreepDOL boxes are small enough to be hidden under a table, or scattered around city streets without being noticed.

By placing the sensor boxes near the places a person visits, you can spy on just about anyone. 

‘It eliminates the idea of “blending into a crowd”’, said Mr O’Conner.

Most people are willing to take their mobile phone wherever they go. 
According to research by Morgan Stanley, 91 per cent of today people keep their mobile phone within 3 feet of them, 24 hours a day

The FBI is hacking people's mobile devices so that they can turn the mic on and listen in on conversations.

This is according to court documents and interviews with people involved, uncovered by the Wall Street Journal.

The records show that only members of organised crime, terrorist cells, and child pornographers have sofar been subject to this sort of surveillance.

The FBI is also reportedly only using these techniques when 'they have no other choice.'

‘If you have a wireless device (phone, iPad, etc.), even if you’re not connected to a network, CreepyDOL will see you, track your movements, and report home.’

He added that no one can guard against the invasion of privacy, adding that applications leak more information than they should.

For instance, a VPN connects to tunnelling software after connecting to a Wi-Fi hub, meaning that at least for a few seconds, their web traffic is known to anyone wants to find out.

Alongside this, every Wi-Fi network that your mobile has ever connected to in the past is also stored in the device and can be shared.

‘These are fundamental design flaws in the way pretty much everything works,’ he said.

Mr O’Connor is founder of a consulting firm called Malice Afterthought. He is also a law student at the University of Wisconsin at Madison.

He told the New York Times that he only used the device to spy on himself due to a law called the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

One of his fellow students, Andrew Auernheimer, was sentenced to 41 months in prison for exploiting a security hole in the computer system of AT&T, which made e-mail addresses accessible for over 100,000 iPad owners.

‘I haven’t done a full deployment of this because the United States government has made a practice of prosecuting security researchers,’ he said in the interview. ‘Everyone is terrified.’

It uses the unique identifier code on tablets and mobiles to get information about a person's location from public Wi-Fi connections

Works even if someone is not connected to a network by using Wi-Fi 'pings'
