Devastating: Evidence has surfaced that Churchill ordered chemical weapons to be dropped on Russia

He is feted as a national hero, but new evidence has come to light that Winston Churchill once ordered 50,000 of the most devastating chemical weapons ever made to be dropped on Russia.

In two months at the end of the First World War, Churchill authorised the M Device - shells with chemical tips - to be dropped over villages and military posts held by the revolutionary Bolsheviks in northern Russia.

Then secretary of state for war, Churchill had wanted the British Government to support the White Army in its civil bitter fight for power with the Bolshevik Red Army, according to Giles Milton author of Russian Roulette.

Mr Milton told The Telegraph Churchill had wanted to 'really go hard against the Bolsheviks, who had seized power from Tsar Nicholas II in 1917.

He said: 'The British had developed this highly secret chemical weapon called the M Device, which is like a shell with a canister of gas on the end.

'It was developed at Porton laboratories in Wiltshire and described by the head of munitions as the most devastating chemical weapon ever devised. It had been invented but not used.

'Churchill’s idea was to use the M Device against the Russian Bolsheviks. Fifty-thousand
 were taken up in planes and then dropped on the Bolshevik Red Army 
positions and Bolshevik controlled villages in northern Russia between 
August and September 1918.'

Although Churchill had wanted to help the White Army, the Government refused to take sides.

Mr Milton, 47, has also revealed Churchill wanted to use chemical weapons against rebellious tribes in North India.

He added: 'What I found really shocking was when he wrote this internal memo to the India Office, along the lines of ‘we should use it against the tribes on the North West front. They’re really troublesome, let’s gas them.'

'There’s a line in the memo that says "I really don’t understand this squeamishness about poison gas". Today that reads pretty badly.'

Minority: In 1917 the Bolsheviks were in the minority, but that did not stop them seizing power and ordering the assassination of Tsar Nicholas II and his family

Mr Milton explained he was researching material for his new book when he discovered a document in the National Archives that had been written by British scientists, who had been sent to Russia to record the effects of the M Device.

Shortly after breathing it in, victims started vomiting blood. They then fell unconscious.

Mr Milton said the British tried to 'play it down' by claiming fatalities were limited. But Russian evidence tells an altogether different story, with one soldier claiming 50 of his comrades were killed.

Despite their fearsome reputation, the M Device did not prove as devastating as Churchill had hoped and thousands of the shells were dumped in the White Sea on the north-west coast of Russia because they were too unstable to fly home.

Asked what effect the latest revelation could have Churchill's image, Mr Milton said: 'He’s a great Briton but there are other sides to his character. He was advocating the mass use of chemical weapons.'

Mr Milton's new book, Russian Roulette, is the true account of British spies who were sent to Russia to undermine Lenin's plot to bring down British India.

Lenin: Churchill was vehemently against the Bolsheviks and described their leader as a 'bacillus'

The Bolsheviks finally seized power in October 1917 following a five-month struggle. Tsar Nicholas II had been toppled during a coup in March, but it was not until later that year that the Bolsheviks finally managed to solidify their grip.

From the outset they were locked in a bitter struggle for power in the Russian parliament, known as the Duma, principally with the liberal Mensheviks.

Bolshevik leader Vladimir Ilych Lenin was living in exile in Switzerland when the first revolution took place.

He struck a deal with the Germans - who were still officially at war with the Russians - that he be allowed to travel on a 'sealed train' from Switzerland, through Germany, and onto Finland, where he crossed the border into Russia.

Churchill later said of the journey: 'They transported Lenin in a sealed truck like a plague bacillus from Switzerland into Russia.'

The Bolsheviks could count on the support of the navy, which proved key in their bid to take power and in October 1917 the Bolsheviks overthrew the provisional government and appointed party members to key posts.

A bloody civil war ensued between the counterrevolutionary White Army and the Bolshevik Red Army that was to drag on four nearly four years.

But by 1922 the Bolsheviks finally defeated the White Army and in 1922 the Union of Soviet Socialist Republic (USSR) was declared.

After a lifetime of fighting to bring about the revolution in Russia, Lenin died in 1924 leaving behind him a power vacuum that would lead to the inauguration of Joseph Stalin in 1928, one of the most brutal dictators the world has ever seen.
