A rural Christian college has banned homosexuality after two of the school's volleyball players came out as gay.

Erskine College in Due West, South Carolina, said that homosexuality wasn't part of 'God's intended design for humanity'.

The liberal arts school with 575 students is affiliated with the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church.

This week, the college issued a 'Statement on Human Sexuality', saying it intended to 'add the statement to its official manuals and determine how it will be integrated into campus culture and procedures'.

'We believe the Bible teaches that all sexual activity outside the covenant of marriage is sinful and therefore ultimately destructive to the parties involved,' part of the statement read, according to OutSports.com. 

The statement comes after two students, Drew Davis and Juan Varona - both players on the Div. II Erskine College men's volleyball team - publicly acknowledged they are gay. 

However, both of them say they have received nothing but support and encouraged from their peers following the admissions.

Both Davis and Varona - who grew up near San Juan in Puerto Rico - admitted they were worried how others would take their sexuality, but say they have been embraced, especially by his teammates, whom he describes as 'like brothers'.

'At first I didn't know how they were going to take it because I'm not from this country,' Varona told OutSports.

'But everybody has been great. 

'I've even had baseball players come up to me and say they were homophobic until they met me. 

'I guess they look at my personality more than whether I'm gay or not.' 

It is for that reason Varona was shocked to learn of the statement his school had put out.

'The release of this statement makes me disappointed because I have never received anything but kind treatment from everyone at this school, and my sexual orientation is no secret,' he said.

'So it took me by surprise.

'I feel that in the time that we are living right now, where even in the conservative state of South Carolina same-sex marriage is legal, the school took several steps back instead of progressing towards a future where everyone can be treated as an equal, which is a future most of the country is moving towards.

'I understand the religious stand on adultery, which is part of the Ten Commandments in the Bible, and that would apply to heterosexual and homosexual people. 

'But when I saw the mention of sexual orientation being an issue, it just made me sad and worried for other gay people who might be struggling with confidence to come out.'

A Christian website, ARPTalk, recently called upon the college to address the fact it had two gay students, after news of Davis and Varona's coming out sparked some media attention.

'With the “outing” of two gay student-athletes on the internet, the gay and lesbian issue is now front-and-center at Erskine College,' the site editor, Charles W. Wilson, posted online.

'Do Acting President Brad Christie and his administrators, staff, and faculty have the Biblical convictions, understanding, and rectitude to competently and Christianly address the gay and lesbian issue at Erskine?'
