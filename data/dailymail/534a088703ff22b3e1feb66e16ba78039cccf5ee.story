Care Quality Commission chairman David Prior chose to have a private hip operation rather than face the three-month wait endured by health service patients. He has come under fire from patient groups who claims he has used a 'fast-track route reserved for those who can afford to pay'

The head of the NHS watchdog chose to have a private hip operation rather than face the three-month wait endured by health service patients.

David Prior, chairman of the Care Quality Commission, had the surgery paid for by his health insurance policy earlier this month.

As well as bypassing NHS waiting times – which are the longest they have been for three years – he was given his own hospital room with en suite bathroom and TV.

His decision provoked fury among patient groups last night, who said it was wrong for a top health official to take advantage of ‘a fast-track reserved for those able to pay’ while others were forced to wait months. They said Mr Prior’s choice to go private showed he had ‘no confidence’ in the hospitals his organisation has been charged with improving.

Official figures this week showed that nearly three million patients are currently waiting for treatment – the highest number for six years – with the average delay for hip surgery more than three months.

As a private patient, Mr Prior would have been able to have the operation almost as soon as he was referred by his GP.

The 59-year-old would have benefited from additional nursing care in a wing partly reserved for private patients at the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital – where he was previously chairman. He would also have been able to personally choose his surgeon and consultant.

Critics said his decision to have the operation privately was evidence of a ‘two-tier’ health system with those who could afford to  pay able to benefit from quicker, safer treatment.

Dr Richard Taylor, co-leader of the National Health Action Party, said: ‘It’s remarkable that the man in charge of assessing the quality and safety of NHS services has just spurned a unique chance of assessing those services for himself from the patient’s point of view.

‘I don’t know the circumstances that influenced his decision to go private. But it appears to be further confirmation that this Government’s policy of running down and selling off our NHS is creating a two-tier service with the fast-track reserved for those able to pay.’

Julie Bailey, founder of Cure the NHS who helped expose the Mid Staffordshire scandal, said: ‘He should be ensuring our hospitals are safe, not going private.

‘He should be setting an example. It’s very disappointing and it’s sending out the wrong signal when the head of the NHS regulator feels he has to go private.’

Mr Prior is understood to have had his operation at the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital earlier this month. A CQC spokesman confirmed Mr Prior had used his health insurance to pay for the operation but denied he was treated on a private ward

John Mann, Labour MP for Bassetlaw in 
Nottinghamshire, added: ‘It’s hardly a vote of confidence in the NHS. 
The person who regulates the NHS should be using the NHS and setting an 
example to all the rest of us.’

In November the CQC’s annual report into the health service said it had found poor care in one in ten hospital inspections – and earlier this month Mr Prior admitted 30 hospitals were providing ‘c*** care.’

His private room and care after the operation would have ensured he was far less vulnerable to infections and conditions related to neglect, such as bedsores.

Earlier this week figures from NICE showed that as many as one in 16 patients pick up an infection in hospital largely because staff are failing to follow basic hygiene measures such as washing their hands. A Labour source said: ‘Patients will be worried to learn that people who run the NHS don’t use it themselves.

‘They will see it as a sign that Prior has little confidence in the NHS, not least after his recent calls for privatisation.’

Since being appointed chairman of the watchdog in January last year, Mr Prior has been highly critical of the NHS and in particular hospital care.

In December he said the health service had become ‘too powerful’ to be criticised and said certain areas were ‘out of control’.

And earlier this month he said the care in 30 hospitals in England was dire and called for greater involvement of the private sector.

Mr Prior – who earns £65,000 a year – is believed to have had his operation done at Norfolk and Norwich’s Cringleford Ward, as this is the only ward in the hospital designated for private patients, as well as teenagers and some NHS patients.

It is not known which insurance firm he is covered by but the largest are BUPA, Prudential, Aviva and AXA PPP, with average annual premiums for a 50-something man ranging from £1,000 to £2,000.

The watchdog chief, who is married and lives in London, was formerly a Tory MP for North Norwich and previously served as a director of a steel-making firm.

He was chairman of Norfolk and Norwich NHS Trust from 2002 until he became chairman of the CQC. A spokesman for the watchdog said: ‘David Prior recently underwent a hip operation and subsequent hospital care at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital.

‘He was not treated in a private ward. He does, however, have private medical insurance and that insurance paid for his procedure and the subsequent care.

‘So he received NHS treatment, the cost of which will be recovered from his insurer.’

The spokesman later added that Mr Prior stayed in one of 12 single side rooms off the main ward.
