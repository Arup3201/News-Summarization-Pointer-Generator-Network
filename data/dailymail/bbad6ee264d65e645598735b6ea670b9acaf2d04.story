Convicted: Darren Newton stole the contents of a kitchen belonging to his friends, Andrew and Michelle Milton

A financial adviser stole an entire kitchen from two friends after pretending to help them out of debt.

Darren Newton, 40, persuaded Andrew Milton and his wife Michelle, both 48, to give up their £310,000, five-bedroom home when it was in danger of being repossessed.

Then, while the couple were living in rented accommodation, Newton paid two tradesman – who knew nothing of the plan – to enter the house and strip the kitchen of various appliances.

They took kitchen goods - including an
oven, a hob, utility room units and even the kitchen sink – knocking 
around £15,000 off the value of the house.

Mr Milton noticed the kitchen had been gutted when he went to visit his home, in Sleaford, Lincolnshire, for one last time.

Police then arrested former RAF man Newton as he returned from a holiday in Abu Dhabi.

When questioned, Newton lied to detectives and told them he had not been to the house since his friends had vacated it.

But yesterday, at Lincoln Magistrates’ Court, he was found guilty of stealing the goods.

During the trial, Mr Milton said he couldn’t ‘comprehend’ what he was seeing when he made the discovery.

‘It took a minute to sink in and then I realised the whole kitchen was missing,’ he said.

‘It was total disbelief.

‘It was so awkward because I couldn’t work out how or why it had happened.

‘But the only other person who had keys was Mr Newton.’

Mrs Milton said they had been shattered by the actions of a man they had considered ‘a really good friend’.

She said: ‘We’re a family just trying to live our lives. You put your trust in someone and this is what happens.

‘If you can’t put your trust in someone like Darren, who can you trust?’

Before: Mr and Mrs Milton's kitchen in the £310,000 home they had lived in for five years

After: £6,500 worth of kitchenware was stolen by former RAF man Milton

Newton, from Evedon, Lincolnshire, first met the Miltons in September 2011 to give them mortgage repayment advice after their house had failed to sell.

He told the court he then asked if he could have the Miltons’ kitchen, to which he claimed the pair told him ‘take whatever you want’.

The businessman, who runs mortgageforce in Sleaford, also suggested the pair took anything of value out of the house.

However, the Miltons told the court this was untrue and explained they could not bring themselves to gut the kitchen.

When the tradesmen entered the property to take the goods, they used keys given to Newton by Mrs Milton on the understanding they would be passed on to the mortgage provider.

Oblivious to their part in the wrongdoing, they took out the goods and put them in the mortgage adviser’s garage so he could use them to refit his utility room.

Mr Milton realised the items - worth more than £6,500 - were missing when he went to visit his home of five years for a final time in November last year.

The police were called and they visited the financial adviser’s business.

When questioned by police he declined to answer any questions but later admitted in court he had lied to a detective when he told her he had sent the house keys to the mortgage provider that June.

Summing up, Paul Wood, prosecuting, said: ‘The Miltons came across as clear and credible.

‘In complete polar opposition to that you heard evidence from Mr Newton which lacked credibility across the board.’

The businessman, who claimed he was ‘protecting the Miltons’ because he thought they were in trouble, was arrested after he returned home from a nine-day holiday to Abu Dhabi last November.

Newton will be sentenced at Lincoln Crown Court at a later date.
