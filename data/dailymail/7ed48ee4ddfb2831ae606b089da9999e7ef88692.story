Loyal: Private Thomas Lake who was killed in an explosion while on foot patrol on Sunday evening

A soldier killed on a patrol in Afghanistan was named as Private Thomas Lake, 29, from the 1st Battalion The Princess of Wales’s Royal Regiment.

His mother Carol said: ‘Tom was a wonderful son and I will miss him more than I can say.

‘He had so many friends who will remember him as a loyal, fun-loving action man.

‘Tom loved the Army and was so proud to be a soldier; he died doing something he loved.’ Pte Lake, from Watford, was hit by a blast from an improvised explosive device while on foot patrol with Afghan forces in the Nahr-e Saraj area of Helmand on Sunday.

A Ministry of Defence spokeswoman said 
Pte Lake was taking part in a patrol to reassure the local population 
when he was caught in the explosion.

She added that he was airlifted to the field hospital at Camp Bastion where he was pronounced dead. Pte Lake had joined the Army in November 2009.

On joining the battalion he attended 
courses, including the Infantry Assault Pioneers’ Course and the Team 
Medics’ Course, and recently completed part one of the Snipers’ Course 
in Brecon, Mid Wales, the MoD spokeswoman said.

His death takes the number of British troops who have died since operations in Afghanistan began in 2001 to 389.

His commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel James Coote, said: 'Pte Lake epitomised the very best qualities of the British infantryman. He was a true Tiger - ever professional and totally committed to his mates and his battalion.

'He had an irrepressible smile and an understated manner that together made him hugely respected by all those that had the privilege to serve with him.

'He packed an almost impossible amount into his two years in the Army, both at work and off duty.

'Where many soldiers would have sought one specialisation in that time he had three - he was a medic, an Assault Pioneer and was also training as a sniper.

'Equally energetic out of uniform, he 
represented the battalion at football, easily earning a coveted place in
the team in his first season.'

'Older than many of his peers, he was often the man that they would turn to for help or advice; maturity and potential abounded and he was fully expected to attend the promotion cadre on his return to Germany.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said: 'The tributes paid to Private Lake by his friends portray a brave soldier who was held in the highest regard.

'His professionalism marked him as an outstanding member of his platoon and he was, by all accounts, destined for promotion.

'Sadly, his full potential will not now be realised and at this tragic time my thoughts are with his mother, Carol.'
