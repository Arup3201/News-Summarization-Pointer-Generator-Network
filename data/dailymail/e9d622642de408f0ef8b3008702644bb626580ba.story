 A Good Samaritan Royal Marine lost his leg after he was hit by flying debris when he stopped to help the victims of a motorway car crash.

Lee Spencer, 45, had stopped to help the stricken driver and passengers, but as he tried to alert other motorists another car smashed into the BMW.

In the force of the crash, the BMW's engine was torn from the vehicle and flew across the motorway lanes, hitting the Colour Sergeant from Horrabridge, Devon, and knocking him over the crash barrier onto the grass verge.

Royal Marine: Lee Spencer lost his leg after he was hit by flying debris when he stopped to help the victims of a motorway car crash

His right leg was severed in the impact, but the serviceman's Forces training kicked in and he was even able to instruct bystanders on how to tie a tourniquet around his leg, and help paramedics to save his life.

Doctors were unable to save the limb, which had to be amputated, but CSgt Spencer, formerly of 3 Commando Brigade, has now dedicated his life to helping others, having raised thousands of pounds for charity before his accident.

Speaking for the first time about the  incident, the married father-of-two said: 'I was extremely close to death, but now I’m in this position where I’m just glad to be here today.

'Now I just want to help people.'

CSgt Spencer had been driving on the M3 through Surrey on January 5 when he spotted hazard lights flashing in the distance.

He could see a BMW had collided with the central reservation, and was partially blocking the middle and outside lanes.

'My immediate thought was well, I’m a first aider, if anyone is left in that car they are in mortal danger and I need to get them out,' he said.

'I pulled over onto the hard shoulder.

Caring: CSgt Spencer, pictured with his wife Claire and children Billy and Harriet, says he has 'no excuses but to get on with life', and wants to use his experiences to help others

Staying positive: CSgt Spencer spent five weeks in hospital, and is now undergoing rehabilitation at Devonport Naval Base’s Hasler Company

'There I saw two men and a woman who were originally in the car, and another person who had stopped to help.

'I made sure they were okay, and that no-one was left in the car.

'I then walked about 200 metres up the hard shoulder using my phone as a torch to try and make drivers aware of the accident.'

CSgt Spencer said he then remembers hearing a loud 'bang' before the sound of people screaming.

He was then hit by something, which he at first thought was a car.

In fact, an Audi had collided at speed with the BMW and the force of the impact between the two cars was so great that the engine of the BMW was thrown from the vehicle.

CSgt Spencer said the engine hurtled 70 metres across the lanes of the motorway, striking him with full force.

The impact knocked him several metres from the hard shoulder, over the barrier, and onto a grass verge.

'I came to a stop, and I was thinking I could feel myself moving and I could hear people screaming,' he said.

'I looked down and saw my left leg at right angles to my body, my right leg was barely still attached.

'I guess it was my training because I started shouting ‘medic, medic’ without thinking where I was.

'I could see I had a catastrophic bleed in my right leg. I knew from my medical training that I had to stop the bleeding fast.

'I knew I had four to six minutes before I was dead. I could feel the symptoms of shock coming on.'

CSgt Spencer’s wife, Claire, said her injured husband had called her from the roadside.

'He rang me and said he’d been in an accident, and then hung up - he later said he didn’t want me to just get a knock at the door with someone bringing the news,' said the 47-year-old.

Charitable: Even before his accident, CSgt Spencer was a keen charity fundraiser, and raised £11,000 by running a 52-mile double marathon

Kind hearted: He ran the back-to-back marathons in aid of Dominic Lovett - a former Royal Marine also from Horrabridge - who was paralysed from the neck down in an accident while on exercise in Norway

Determined: CSgt Spencer also ran a marathon across Dartmoor, which took him nine hours due to a severe snow storm hitting the high moor

'Apparently he was telling people how to save his life. That was the Royal Marine training in him.

'Everyone was panicking and he was just so calm telling people how to tie a tourniquet using a belt.

'He even helped the paramedics when they arrived.

'It’s unbelievable really but that’s how Lee is.'

When he came around from his medically-induced coma in the Intensive Care Unit at St George’s Hospital in Tooting, CSgt Spencer was told that doctors had been forced to amputate his right leg.

While being treated at the Headley Court rehabilitation centre earlier this year, a Warrant Officer suggested Csgt Spencer attend an event supporting Royal Marines  completing the final phase of their ‘1664 Challenge’.

As part of the event, the six marines took on a moonlit 30-mile march from Greenwich to London, and Prince Harry was there to wish the marines good luck.

'I planned to do a sponsored one-mile walk, leading them on the first mile,' said CSgt Spencer. 

'After I finished I met Prince Harry and his first question to me was "why wasn’t I doing the whole 30 miles".

'I don’t think he realised I had only lost my leg six months previously, and had only been out of a wheelchair for a month.'

CSgt Spencer completed the mile in 19 minutes and 38 seconds, and has so far raised more than £7,000.

His left leg had been dislocated and had to be totally reconstructed, while CSgt Spencer was told he had lost more than half of the blood in his body.

He spent five weeks in hospital, and is now undergoing rehabilitation at Devonport Naval Base’s Hasler Company.

Mrs Spencer said her husband is a true hero in every since of the word.

'He’s served in Afghanistan three times, as well as tours in Northern Ireland and Iraq,' added Mrs Spencer, who works for West Devon Borough Council.

'He’s served his country.

'He comes back unscathed from war, and then loses his leg on leave while helping someone.

'He just amazes me.

'We’ve been together for 28 years, and married for 21 years, and he’s always amazed me.

'He is inspirational to others - a lot of others - but to me and our children he’s just amazing.

'He has dark days, which is understandable, but he just gets up and gets on with it.'

Csgt Spencer, whose bravery has been recognised with nominations for the Pride of Plymouth, and Pride of Britain Awards, said he was 'lucky to be alive'.

'It has been hard and I wouldn’t recommend it,' he said.

'It’s been far from a totally negative experience.

'I’ve done three tours of Afghanistan, and an untold amount of patrols.

'Every soldier who has done that and gone outside the gate, you’ve mentally prepared yourself for an injury like this.

'I think that mentality is still in me. Bizarrely it wasn’t a massive shock for this to happen to me.

'I look at other marines like Plymouth marine Mark Ormrod who lost both his legs and an arm and they’ve been in a worse position than me.

'I feel like I have no excuse but to get on with my life. You can’t just wallow in self pity.'

Joining forces: CSgt Spencer joined fellow Royal Marines for a one mile sponsored walk through London

Even before his accident, CSgt Spencer was a keen charity fundraiser and last year raised £11,000 by running two back to back marathons in aid of Dominic Lovett - a former Royal Marine also from Horrabridge - who was paralysed from the neck down in an accident while on exercise in Norway.

He also raised £2,000 through running a marathon over Dartmoor, which took him nine hours due to a severe snow storm hitting the high moor.

While in hospital recovering from his injuries he began planning his future fundraising efforts, and is considering undertaking a variety of challenges.

'Crazy things like swimming the Channel, running a marathon and using what happened to me in a positive way,' he said.

'My main aim is to continue with the rehab and I want to use the experience to help others.

'I’ve loved my time as a Royal Marine. When I look back what I have enjoyed so much is the service; there is something meaningful in service - it is very much a part of me.'
