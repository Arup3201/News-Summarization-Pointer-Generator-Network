He began his career in television 61 years ago - and he's not stopping now.

Veteran broadcaster Sir David Attenborough will return to the small screen in the New Year with a new wildlife series that could be his most extraordinary adventure yet.

The 87-year-old will bring to life a dozen iconic skeletal and fossilised exhibits in London's Natural History Museum for a groundbreaking 3D film.

Among the resurrected beasts are the museum's diplodocus, 
the huge dinosaur named 'Dippy' that has dominated the central hall since 1905.

Other creatures chosen by Sir David include the moa, a giant 
flightless bird that became extinct in the 14th century, and 
a gigantophis, a huge snake that grew up to 36ft in length about 40 million years
ago.

The exhibits will be
revived for David Attenborough's Natural History Museum Alive using advanced computer-generated imagery and 
the latest 3D technology.

Sir David, who first visited the museum when he was eight, said: 'We've applied the very latest technology to bring back to life some of the most romantic extinct creatures imaginable.

'We've also drawn on the expertise of 
the museum's specialists to explore some of the biggest and, until now, 
unanswered questions surrounding their existence.'

The film was shot at night in the 
museum over seven weeks last summer and at one stage Attenborough worked
10 nights in a row from 7pm to 4.30am, The Sunday Times reported.

Anthony Geffen, producer and chief executive of Atlantic Productions, said: 'Remember how old he is and how hot last summer was? Yet David was on remarkably good form throughout.'

In the film, Sir David appears to react to the CGI images as they walk or fly around the museum and watches in delight as the diplodocus comes alive.
