Devastated family members have paid tribute to a 13-year-old honor student who plummeted to his death from a 15th-floor hotel balcony as he and his family were wrapping up their Florida vacation.

Zach Dickman, from Plainfield, Indiana, was checking out of the Palazzo Condominiums in Panama City with his mother, Rita, and grandparents when he realized he had left his phone in their room.

He returned to theroom to retrieve it, but as the 7th grader searched for the device, he somehow fell to his gruesome death from the balcony down to a pool deck below.

When he failed to meet his family, his grandmother went to check on him and made the heartbreaking discovery.

Don Dickman, the boy's great-uncle, said he heard about the tragedy late on Saturday.

'Zachary
 was an honor student and big into soccer,' he told the Journal Review. 
'He was active in school and just a great kid. It is pretty hard on the 
family right now.'

Dickman, himself a police officer, 
said the Panama City Beach police told him that no foul play is 
suspected 'and that it was just a horrible accident'.

He
 continued: 'I asked if any family members were witnesses, and thank 
goodness none of the family saw it happen. Right now we are all 
heartbroken and devastated.'

He said that the family left Florida for their home in Indiana on Sunday.

Friends and relatives also flocked to his mother's Facebook page to pay tribute to her beloved son.

 floors from this balcony on Saturday as his mother check out of the hotel. He had returned to the room to retrieve his forgotten cellphone

Tragic: Zachary plummeted to a pool deck below, but authorities have not yet said how he fell

'Zach
 was always such a grounded boy who seemed far mature for his years,' 
one wrote. 'Heaven gained another angel to light the heavens.'

Authorities were dispatched to the hotel around 10am after receiving a call from the boy's grandmother.

She
 said she had gone to the room to check on Zachary but 
when she called out his name from another room, she did not get a 
response.

'[She] waited for a few seconds. 
Started calling his name no answer, that's when she realized he fell off
 the balcony,' Panama City Beach Police Chief Drew Whitman told WJHG.

Authorities
 say they have no reason to believe Zachary's death was anything but 
accidental. However, the cause of death would not be named until an 
autopsy could be performed.

Funeral arrangements will be made later this week.

Plainfield school officials said counselors were being made available for students.

'We are deeply saddened to learn of the death of one of our students, Zachary Dickman, who died while in Florida over spring break,' officials wrote in a statement, shared on Fox59.

'Zach was in 7th grade at Plainfield Community Middle School. He was an honor roll student, well-liked and extremely bright. He was also active in the Plainfield Community Middle School band.

'The loss of Zach is a sobering tragedy for our school community. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to Zach's family.'
