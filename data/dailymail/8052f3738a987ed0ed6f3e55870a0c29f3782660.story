Andrew Oldham, 48, from Blackpool

Andrew Oldham took one look at his mother, Barbara, asleep in the chair and felt tears catching in his throat. Her head was lolling on to her chest, her eyes were glazed and she was drooling slightly. When Andrew called her name she barely responded.

'It was as if all her personality had gone - it didn't feel like this was my mum any more,' says Andrew.

What was so upsetting for him was that Barbara, then 83, had until the previous three months always been so outgoing and chatty. But she had suddenly, inexplicably gone downhill.

Barbara, who formerly worked in a department store, had lived in the care home since 2002.

'She was not incapacitated nor did she have dementia,' says Andrew, 48, a theatre promoter from Blackpool. 'She had such a zest for life, always cracking jokes.'

Yet the woman sitting in front of him on his visit to the Carders Court Care home in Castleton, Rochdale, on Christmas Day 2011 was very different.

Staff claimed it was just that she had not slept well. 'I said that's not poor sleep - that's someone who's drugged,' says Andrew.

He was right. An inquiry by Rochdale Council in 2013 found the Bupa-run care home had been giving his mother the sedative Promazine 'almost nightly'. They had requested her GP prescribe it five months earlier on account of her 'inappropriate behaviour', claiming she was agitated and disrupting residents.

Yet no one else - not Andrew nor even the GP who prescribed the drug - had seen such behaviour.

How drugs can raise stroke risk

Promazine is an antipsychotic drug commonly prescribed to the elderly for 'moderate to severe agitation'.

Potential side-effects include drowsiness, confusion, slow or irregular heart rate, deep vein thrombosis, eye problems and a drop in blood pressure that can cause dizziness.

What is shocking is that two months before, Andrew had discovered his mother was being given the drug inappropriately and had already kicked up a fuss.

The changes in her behaviour had slowly crept on since the summer.

'I'd visit once a week or more and would normally find Mum bustling about, helping staff clear up or chatting to others,' he says. 'Yet she started seeming strangely subdued and tired,' he says.

'By October 2011 she was getting worse. We couldn't laugh and joke as before - her speech was often slurred and sometimes she barely opened her eyes.'

'I spoke to her GP, who listed all the medications Mum was on and mentioned Promazine.

'I said 'hang on, what's that for?' and the GP said it was because of her 'inappropriate behaviour'. I asked if she'd seen my mother like this? She admitted she hadn't. Yet this GP had prescribed this drug at the request of the care home staff.'

The GP agreed to halve the dose. But the Rochdale Council inquiry - launched after a complaint by Andrew - found the care home staff continued to give it to his mother almost every night, not merely as needed as the GP had prescribed it, and for one week she had the full dose.

The inquiry found that what the staff had done was tantamount to 'physical abuse'.

Andrew, with the help of Patient Claim Line solicitors, took legal action against the care home and eventually received an apology and a £5,000 payout from Bupa last year.

Days after that Christmas in 2011, Andrew moved his mother to a different care home. He says it took six months to clear the drug out of her system. 'A week after she arrived she was still very drowsy and fell on her face. Then three weeks later she fell again and broke her ankle. She had osteoporosis, so could never stand or walk again - all because, I think, of that Promazine.'

Tellingly, the new home never reported any 'inappropriate behaviour', nor did she need any sedatives right up until she died in March 2014, aged 85.

A Bupa statement says: 'This incident happened two years ago. Since then the care home has taken action to prevent this happening.'

The Oldham family's experience is hardly unique. In a shocking study published in the Nursing Times last year, pharmacists went into 463 care homes nationwide to audit the antipsychotic medication given to elderly patients.

They found a quarter receiving it did not have symptoms to warrant its use.

Doctors told to cut prescriptions

The use of chemical coshes to subdue the elderly to make them easier to handle by care home and other staff was meant to have been stamped out after a 2009 edict from the Department of Health for doctors to reduce prescription of antipsychotics such as Promazine by two-thirds.

This was the result of a 2009 study of 180,000 people with dementia who were on the drugs, which found the medication was inappropriate for 140,000 of them. It also found that about 1,800 frail dementia patients died each year as a result of these drugs. Antipsychotics were originally developed for treating schizophrenia to reduce delusions, but they also have a sedative effect.

However, they increase the risk of blood clots and stroke. And a 2008 study in Sweden found putting elderly people on antipsychotics made them twice as likely to have a fall, possibly due to the drugs' effect on alertness.

For an elderly person, falls can be fatal - as highlighted by the case of Peter Ryley, 76. The grandfather, from Long Eaton, Derbyshire, died after falling and injuring his head when an excessive amount of sedatives left him 'practically delirious' after his admission to Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham. The hospital later apologised.

In the aftermath of the 2009 report, an audit found the prescriptions for antipsychotics dropped by 52 per cent, but there has been no audit since.

However, a 2013 study by Queens University Belfast found that about 20 per cent of elderly people in care homes are still given anti-psychotic drugs compared with 1 per cent of people the same age still living in the community.

Why the pills are sometimes justified

Liberal Democrat MP Paul Burstow, a former health minister who announced the drive to push down the use of antipsychotics, says the results of another audit were due to be published last autumn. 'Quite why that has not happened we don't know,' he says.

The Health and Social Care Information Centre says there has been a delay in publishing the new audit because of changes in how the data is collected.

Mr Burstow fears the move to reduce the use of these drugs has 'slipped down the agenda' for both GPs and care home staff.

'We were making good progress by training GPs and staff,' he says. 'But there is such a high turnover of staff in care homes that it's something we need to keep at, and we need repeat audits.

'There is little justification for the systematic use of these drugs that we know can shorten lives. There are other ways of managing behaviour than doping people.'

The problem is that once people get put on these drugs, often they don't get taken off them, says Clive Bowman, visiting professor at City University and a former medical director of care homes and a NHS gerontologist.

He says elderly people who go into hospital with a chest or urine infection can become delirious, seem confused and become disruptive, so may be put on sedatives. Delirium affects as many as a fifth of all hospital patients, but is most common among elderly patients.

'There are occasions when someone causes a disturbance and you have to make a hard decision,' he says. 'Do you allow the other 29 people on the ward to suffer or sedate the person making the disturbance?'

But once the infection clears, the patient leaves hospital and the sedative drugs go with them.

As Professor Bowman explains: 'They may then be discharged to a care home with a new GP, and the only information the GP will have is 'chest infection, became confused' and the medicines they are on, including sedatives. The GP will assume these medicines need to be continued.'

Is the answer as easy as a cup of tea?

Dementia patients are some of the most likely to be prescribed sedatives because they can become agitated and aggressive - but there is often a reason, explains Professor June Andrews, a former nurse who runs the Dementia Services Development Centre at the University of Stirling.

'They may become agitated when they need the loo or a drink, or because they've become fixated on the idea their daughter needs to be taken to school,' she says.

One common trigger for agitation in dementia patients is untreated pain, according to recent reports - painkillers can help. In other cases, Professor Andrews says taking the person for a walk, playing music or even giving them a cup of tea may ease the agitation.

GPs often assume staff will have done all they can to address agitation before asking for a prescription. The Alzheimer's Society agrees that these drugs are too readily handed out and wants better training on the alternatives for care home staff.

Professor Andrews agrees: 'These drugs are wonderful used in the right dose with the right person, but with the frail and elderly they must be used really sparingly.'

Andrew Oldham misses his mother deeply, but says: 'I'm pleased she spent the last part of her life happy being herself and not a drugged zombie.'

The Royal College of GPs did not respond to a request for comment.
