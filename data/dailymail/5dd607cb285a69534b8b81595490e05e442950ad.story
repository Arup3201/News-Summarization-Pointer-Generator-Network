It is usually patients who are afraid of dentists, but when a 75 stone polar bear needed root canal treatment yesterday, the dynamics of that relationship could easily have changed around.  

Arktos the polar bear had been suffering from toothache so vets from the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland had to check over his 42 razor sharp teeth.

Early yesterday morning Arktos was darted with tranquilisers and the three hour dental operation began.

Keepers had noticed that the usually playful polar bear seemed to be feeling sorry for himself and not hanging out with fellow bear Walker quite so much.

Broken or infected teeth are a major cause of large carnivore debilitation and death in the wild.

Walker and Arktos, the only polar bears on display in the UK, had been trained to open their huge powerful mouths to show their keepers their terrifying teeth.

A small area of discolouration was spotted on Arktos’ upper left canine tooth and the Highland Wildlife Park called in external dental experts to fix the problem.

When experts got four-year-old Arktos into the equivalent of a dentist’s chair - a specially reinforced table made from scaffolding poles and planks - they discovered he needed a root canal.

One of his teeth had become damaged at the tip and rotted through, so it needed drilling out, cleaning and then packing with dental cement. Exactly the same procedure as in humans, just with a tooth canal almost six times the size.

Douglas Richardson, Animal Collection Manager at the Highland Wildlife Park, said: 'Because we regularly train our polar bears and other large animals to take part in regular health checks, this means that we can spot issues like this before they become a problem and give our animals the best possible care available.

'Arktos really is a lucky bear and we were delighted to be able to save his tooth; in the wild the infection would have tracked through his system, causing him a great deal of pain and discomfort and, over the longer term, it could eventually kill him.

'Although due to his size an operation like this is never straight forward, the dental work carried out is actually very similar to a root canal that we humans would have - although obviously on a much larger scale.

'Arktos needed a specially made and reinforced operating table and a team of 12 to carry out the procedure.

'As far as we can tell, the operation was a success. It took three hours in total and Arktos just took 20 minutes to come round. He was then up on his feet, although still a bit wobbly.

'He quickly had a drink and we expect him to start eating again this morning, when we will try him on some of his favourite soft foods as his mouth will still be a bit sore.

Arktos spent the night in a small holding area and then should be reunited with Walker later today.'

The operation lasted three hours and involved a team of ten experts: two dentists, two radiographers, two veterinarians, one vet nurse and three senior animal staff.

Arktos arrived at the Highland Wildlife Park in early April 2012 from Hannover Zoo. He was born in Vienna Zoo in 2007.

After the operation it’s hoped he will soon be able to enjoy food again for his fifth birthday on November 30.

Earlier last year the Park’s other polar bear, Walker, also underwent a dental procedure. In this case a tooth extraction, Walker had a canine tooth that had not developed properly, likely due to an injury when he was a cub, which had become infected.
