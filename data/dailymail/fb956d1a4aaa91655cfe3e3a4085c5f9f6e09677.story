It's a trend that's already been popular in the U.S. after Mariah Carey painted her baby bump - now the craze is taking off in the UK as expectant mothers seek to celebrate their pregnancies in artistic fashion.

Leila Searle, 27, a face painter from Upton in Poole, Dorset, has expanded her face painting business to include body art on baby bumps after she received requests from mothers-to-be.

She found the service was popular at baby showers - another tradition from the U.S. that is becoming more common in Britain.

Leila explained: 'I opened my beauty business a few years ago and then took a face painting course. Last August I had a phone call from a customer asking me if I would paint their baby bump.

'I love face painting and was up for 
it, and so I went along to her baby shower and began decorating her bump
and it kicked off from there. Unlike children, adults sit still while I'm painting, and I can be more creative which is great.'

Artistic way to announce the news: Mothers who know the sex or have chosen the name of their baby can have this included in the style

The beauty therapists uses theatrical
make-up, glitter, and diamantes to create the images on blossoming stomachs that wouldn't seem out of place on a canvas - but won't be to everyone's taste.

Her designs have included intricate flowers, pretty butterflies, a realistic-looking globe, and potential baby names.

Leila creates each image by building up layers of individual colour and waiting for them to dry before adding extra details and blending the shades.

Marking the occasion: Leila's services are in demand at baby showers

Temporary creation: The pictures last for about a day and can be washed off with soapy water or baby wipes

Each picture is created with non-toxic paint that is completely safe for pregnant women to use and lasts all day before it can be removed with baby wipes or soapy water.

Leila said: 'Once it's dry it shouldn't smudge, but the idea is to take photos to have as keepsakes and memories that will last.'

The art sessions £35 pounds for an hour, £20 pounds per additional hour or £65 pounds including a photoshoot.
