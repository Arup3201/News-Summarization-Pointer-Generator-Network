The former boss of Scotland Yard has been condemned for urging the public to boycott elections for police and crime commissioners.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling attacked Lord Blair for telling people not to vote for elected commissioners because he doesn’t believe they should be managing forces.

The cross-bench peer, who was branded ‘New Labour’s favourite policeman’ during his time as Metropolitan Police Commissioner, said the best way to stop the shake-up was to stay away on November 15, when elections will be held across England and Wales except in London.

Boycott: Lord Blair (right) has told voters to ignore the elections for police and crime commissioners but Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said the remarks were 'silly' and former senior officers should not make them

But Mr Grayling hit back, saying: ‘I 
think it’s a very silly thing to say. I’m very sorry he’s said that. 
Nobody should ever look upon a democratic election as something they 
shouldn’t take part in.

‘Parliament has decided to put these 
positions in place, I think they’ll make a real difference locally and 
they will give frustrated communities unhappy about their policing 
somewhere to turn to get help. We should not have a former senior police
officer making a silly comment like this.’

The commissioners – who will be paid 
between £65,000 and £100,000 – will replace police authorities, taking 
charge of budgets and overall strategy for the 41 forces. They will also
have the power to hire and fire chief constables, which critics warn 
could politicise policing.

Lord Blair, who was forced out of his 
job in 2008 when Boris Johnson took over as London Mayor, said: ‘I 
actually hope people don’t vote because that’s the only way to stop 
this. This is not an appropriate system.’

Questions on police commissioners

He said the police areas, which are 
larger than constituencies and local authorities, would be too big for 
any individual to manage properly.

David Cameron yesterday said the 
commissioners would ‘put people in charge of policing’ and ‘bang heads 
together to get things done’.

He added: ‘If you want more tough 
policing, you can get it. If you want coppers who are on the beat, on 
your street, cracking down on anti-social behaviour, focusing on the 
things you care about, then don’t just talk about it, get out on 
November 15 and vote for it.’

Ministers have been accused of failing
to explain the shake-up to the public, or attracting enough 
high-profile candidates. The Electoral Reform Society says turnout could
be as low as 18.5 per cent.

Former deputy prime minister John Prescott and Labour MPs Tony Lloyd and Alun Michael are  the best-known candidates.
