Shoppers may soon be able to walk through a secret Victorian shopping street after it was revealed the maze could be reopened for business.

The cavern of former shops and stables were uncovered under the Royal Arcade - a two-storey complex of stores and flats in Keighley, West Yorkshire.

Last used in the 1890s, it was found after builders smashed their way through while converting the arcade in 2002 - but has not yet been redeveloped.

Times gone by: Old shops and stables were uncovered under the Royal Arcade - a two-storey complex of stores and flats in Keighley, West Yorkshire

Underground: Last used in the 1890s, the concealed cavern was found after builders smashed their way through while converting the arcade in 2002

Hopes: Nick Holroyd, manager of the Royal Arcade, is seen underground. It's believed these adverts were put up after its closure, for the purposes of tours to the street

Much of the Victorian building work on the cellars of seven shops was still intact, while wooden shop-fronts and stable pens were in place.

Constructors also found doors, signs and fittings from some of the original shops in the street, which was then owned by Frank Booth and Mark Holroyd.

The pair could not allow people into the street due to health and safety concerns - or secure funding to create a permanent visitor attraction.

But after the Holroyd family bought out Mr Brook, they have begun developing the arcade through an internet presence and events.

In recent years there have been tour groups taken down to the street, which has been wired up  - and some items from the post-1890s have been added.

Nowadays: The exterior of the Royal Arcade in Keighley is pictured in modern day - and it is hoped that people will soon be able to shop underground

In the past: This is an undated view of the Royal Arcade interior, which is situated above the underground shopping street in West Yorkshire

Interior: This is what the Royal Arcade looks like today - although people have not yet been allowed into the underground street due to health and safety

Above: Mr Holroyd has enlisted an architect and structural engineer - and plans are being made to develop the street below, which has space for up to eight units

A basket of groceries is much cheaper today than 150 years ago, costing just one-thirteenth of what it did in the 1860s, according to research by The Grocer magazine.

Tea (250g): £49.17 // £1.20 today

Sugar (500g): £16.41 // £0.99 today

Milk (4pts): £4.96 // £1.29 today

Eggs (12): £22.30 // £2.50 today

Pineapple: £149 in 1860 // £1.00 today

Now Nick Holroyd, manager of the Royal Arcade, is investigating whether the street - once at ground level - can be restored.

'It will be a working environment - shops that would fit in with what it used to be. We’ll utilise what’s in there'

Nick Holroyd, Royal Arcade manager

Mr Holroyd said: ‘We’d be very restricted for what we could do.

'It’s mainly on safety and fire assessment grounds. If we can get these things sorted then we definitely will develop it.

'It’s something we would really like to do. We’ve looked at opening it up with craft shops. It will be a working environment - shops that would fit in with what it used to be. We’ll utilise what’s in there.’

Other ideas being considered include creating a visitor attraction or converting the old shops for use by craftsmen and specialist traders.
