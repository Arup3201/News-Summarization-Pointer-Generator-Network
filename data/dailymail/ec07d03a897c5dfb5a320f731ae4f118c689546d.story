A relieved Australian couple are on the way to the World Cupil in Brazil after a travel agent blunder first sent them to El Salvador's crime ridden capital by accident.

Newlyweds Orin and Melissa van Lingen ended up in San Salvador, in El Salavador, instead of Salvador in Brazil, where they planned to watch Spain and Holland play at the Arena Fonte Nova stadium on Friday June 13.

'We are just through transit now to get on another flight,' Melissa told MailOnline on Monday, three days after arriving in the wrong country.

San Salvador is 6332km from Salvador and it will take the couple over 15 hours to fly between the two cities.

Disaster: Newlyweds Orin and Melissa van Lingen ended up in San Salvador, in El Salavador, instead of Salvador in Brazil, this week

Long journey: The couple arrived in San Salvador, in El Salvador, 9,736 miles from home. They were meant to be in Salvador, Brazil, which is 10,527 miles from Darwin

The van Lingen's holiday of a lifetime was organised by travel agent Escape Travel, which is a secondary company of Australia's leading travel agent, Flight Centre.

The pair didn't realise the wrong flights had been booked until they were on a flight to Los Angeles airport in the US.

The couple, from Darwin, ended up missing Holland thrash Spain - thanks to Dutch players Robin van Persie and Arjen Robben - 5-1, on Friday.

Speaking from a hotel room in San Salvador, Ms van Lingen told the Sunday Terrotorian: 'We assumed there must be connecting flights but it was not until we got into the airport and there were no other flights.'

San Salvador is known for its high murder rates and gang crime. It is 9,736 miles from their home in Darwin, whereas their final destination was meant to be 10,527 miles from home.

They originally had a hotel booked in Brazil and the couple have been promised by Escape Travel that they will be reimbursed for any money lost.

The couple are hopeful they will catch the next World Cup soccer games to be played in Salvador.

On Monday, Germany will play Portugal at 13:00 and Switzerland will take on France on Friday at 16:00, Brazil time.

Flight Centre Travel Group spokesman Haydn Long told MailOnline: 'This was a misunderstanding on Escape Travel's part and our people are working with the customers to resolve the issue, to ensure they are as happy as possible and to ensure they can enjoy the rest of their holiday.

'In this instance, Escape Travel has provided alternative accommodation and arranged flights to Brazil to ensure their plans are back on track ahead of the next game.'

He added: 'Although Escape Travel didn't book the customers' match tickets, we have also worked today to help resolve an unrelated issue that the customers were experiencing.

'In addition, we will continue to work with the customers to see if we can make amends in other ways for the initial error.

'We have apologised and hope the arrangements we are making now will lead to a positive outcome.'
