ADVENTURES IN STATIONERY by James Ward (Profile £12.99) 

It seems we just can't get enough of stationery and many of us grow attached to our staplers and notebooks

Ah, stationery. Pens, notebooks, staples, paperclips. Envelopes in countless sizes, files and folders, rolls of white stickers, paper lined and plain. Do I love stationery because I’m a writer? Or here’s a more terrifying thought: did I become a writer because I have a bit of a thing about stationery?

Not everyone who writes for a living has a weird and over-arching interest in the tools of their trade, though you can spot many of us loitering dangerously outside Ryman’s most mornings of the week.

Muriel Spark, interviewed a few years before her death, revealed that she wrote each of her slender, but pithy novels in a particular type of notebook she had found at a stationer’s in Edinburgh.

When she heard that the manufacturers of the notebook were going out of business, she quickly bought up the remaining stock. In her 80s, she had only two or three left. When her supply ran out, she would stop writing. I have often wondered since whether she lived long enough to run out of these books.

James Ward understands all this implicitly. He grew up in Worcester Park, Surrey, and used to hang around Fowlers, an independent stationers on the High Street. They had foolscap suspension files. The young Ward was entranced.

‘I would spend long periods of time here studying these objects. Picking them up, turning them over in my hand. Sometimes I’d even buy something.’

Children's author Roald Dahl famously favoured American pencils and sharpened six each morning

Recently, he returned to Fowlers, which hadn’t changed at all, and rooting around on the shelves found a Velos 1377 revolving desk tidy. Remember that?

It was a small, round plastic item, with a transparent cover and six compartments. In each section you’d keep drawing pins, paper clips or bulldog clips. The box was covered with dust and obviously hadn’t been touched for years. He had to have it. It was so old it didn’t have a barcode. He thought it might be older than he was.

Ward’s book (his first) is a heartfelt paean to stationery, as well as a history of some of its component parts. If you ever wanted to find out who invented Tipp-Ex or how paper clips came to be that shape, this is the place to find out. Foolscap paper, for example, was named after the fool’s cap watermark that particular size of paper used to carry from the 15th century onwards. How much more romantic a name, somehow, than A4.

The Moleskine notebook, a beautiful artefact in itself, calls itself ‘the heir and successor’ to the ‘legendary’ notebook used by such notable figures as Van Gogh, Picasso and Hemingway.

This does not mean it’s exactly the same thing. When the Moleskine brand was bought by its current owners, the note ‘bound and printed in China’ started appearing on the products.

Picasso enjoyed using Moleskine notebooks

There was uproar. Had production of these ancient and important notebooks been moved there? No, they had always been made there. But that didn’t stop some Moleskine aficionados from stockpiling the old, ‘proper’ Moleskines. Stationery can drive people doolally.

In the 18th century, Keswick, in Cumbria, was the global centre of pencil manufacture. The highest quality graphite in the world was mined nearby. Roald Dahl favoured American pencils, and sharpened six each morning.

John Steinbeck had a huge callus on the third finger of his right hand just from using a pencil for so many hours a day. He favoured Faber-Castell’s Blackwing 602, but acknowledged that, in one sense, his life had been an unending quest for the perfect pencil.

Stationery is, according to research, the most effective form of promotional merchandise there is. Give people a free pen and they will love you for ever. In 2007, Ikea customers in the UK used 12,317,184 pencils.

Morrissey once described visiting Ryman’s as ‘the most extreme sexual experience one could ever have’. As Ward points out, this probably means ‘the most extreme sexual experience one could ever have with Morrissey’.

Which office stationery item lasts longest? Ward thinks it might be the stapler. ‘You’ll move on to another job, but your stapler will remain. Returned to the stationery cupboard, awaiting a new owner, ready to build a new relationship.’ Sometimes, though, the bond becomes too strong. According to Rexel, during the recent recession many staff made redundant took their staplers home.

Ernest Hemingway was also devoted to a particular brand of stationery

Ward reveals, en passant, that he worked in libraries ‘for many years’. (His favourite classification number in the Dewey Decimal system is 651: Office Services.) Anyone who can call a chapter ‘Everything I know about people, I learnt from pens’ is likely to have a singular take on the world, and so it proves.

Most important of all, in this age of rampant technological advance, he believes that stationery has a bright future. ‘No one has ever needed to borrow a charger because the battery on their pencil has died.’

This is the optimism that created the Post-it note and Pritt stick. Stationery devotees across the globe can only hope he’s right.
