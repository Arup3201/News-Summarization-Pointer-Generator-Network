Germany coach Joachim Low has called up newcomer Karim Bellarabi for the upcoming European Championship qualifying matches against Poland and Ireland.

The Bayer Leverkusen attacking midfielder was born in Berlin but was also eligible to play for Morocco. 

Bellarabi is enjoying a breakthrough season, catching attention when he scored the quickest goal in Bundesliga history, nine seconds into a 2-0 victory over Borussia Dortmund in the opening round of the season.
