Families will start to feel they have more money each month, George Osborne will claim today as he urges Britain to 'celebrate' low inflation.

The Chancellor will use a speech to claim the cost of living could start to fall within months after inflation dropped to a record low of 0.5 per cent.

A supermarket price war and falling petrol prices means the Consumer Price Index rate of inflation is at its lowest point for almost 15 years.

Chancellor George Osborne will use a speech to claim the cost of living could start to fall within months after inflation dropped to a record low of 0.5 per cent

The Consumer Prices Index takes into account the changing cost every aspect of daily life, including housing bills, food, transport and recreation.

A rise of 0.5 per cent means an average basket of goods which cost £100 in December 2013 had risen to only £105 last month. 

Economists said that the continued plunge in the oil price means inflation is likely to fall further and that brief period of negative inflation was 'not entirely out of the question'. This would mean that average prices are falling, making life cheaper for most people.

At the same time wages have started to rise, up 1.6 per cent in October, well ahead of falling inflation, which means people are better off in real terms.

In a speech tonight to the Royal Economic Society, Mr Osborne will say: 'Of course we will always remain vigilant to ensure that inflation is low for the right reasons.

'But we should not confuse this welcome news for Britain's households as a result of falling oil prices with the threat of damaging deflation that we see in the eurozone.

'Rising real incomes, a recovery spreading to all parts of our economy, and family budgets that can stretch that little bit further - let's celebrate these effects of low inflation, not fear them.' 

Latest figures show that wages were up 1.6 per cent in October, well ahead of falling inflation

Sharp falls in food and transport costs were the biggest drivers in the fall in inflation to 0.5 per cent, the ONS said

Here are five key questions about the fall in inflation:

Why is inflation so low?

The key drivers are falls in fuel and food costs. These are caused by tumbling oil prices, which are at their lowest level for nearly six years, and fierce supermarket competition, which has resulted in negative food and drink inflation for six months.

Is it good news?

Ultra-low inflation means the cost of living is barely rising, so wages give households more spending power than they would have. Experts say this should spur spending, boosting the economy and cheering voters ahead of the general election in May.

What might it mean for interest rates?

Policymakers tackle rising inflation by raising interest rates, so low inflation should push back the timing of any hike in rates, which have been held at 0.5% for nearly six years - easing the strain on mortgage borrowers but spelling more pain for savers.

Is there any downside to falling inflation?

Negative inflation, or deflation, could potentially lead to a spiral of falling prices in which consumers postpone purchases and firms cancel investment. If wages then fall repayments on loans such as mortgages would become less affordable.

What might happen now?

Economists predict inflation will continue to fall to new record lows of around 0.2% and some say there is an outside chance of a brief period of deflation, though the path is hard to predict given the volatile nature of oil prices. 

In addition to food and petrol bills falling, gas and electricity bills barely rose last month unlike last year when the Big Six came under fire for large price hikes. 

The fall in inflation will ease pressure on household budgets as it boosts real-terms pay as well as pushing further into the future any need to raise interest rates.

The Bank of England’s governor Mark Carney said inflation was likely to ‘drift a little lower’ in the coming months, admitting that deflation is ‘possible’. 

He insisted that interest rates would ‘move up over the next couple of years’ – but economists say they are unlikely to rise before 2016. 

Mr Carney said: ‘By and large, these figures are good news in the short-term for British households.

‘[It] means your pound is going to stretch further. The issue is to make sure this doesn’t become more generalised... a little bit of inflation is good for the economy.’

The drop will trigger a letter of explanation from Mr Carney to the Chancellor, because it means inflation is more than 1 per cent off the Bank’s 2 per cent target.

Mr Osborne will add: 'The low inflation we see here in the UK - driven as it is almost entirely by external factors such as the oil price - is much more welcome than in the eurozone where inflation has been very low for some time and is now negative.

'There the debate has understandably turned to the dangers of deflation - the risk of a self-reinforcing spiral where economic activity falters, consumers defer purchases as prices fall and nominal debt burdens become ever harder to manage.'

Mr Osborne suggested the European Central Bank's (ECB) inflation target could be changed so it is obliged to take action when inflation is below 2 per cent - as well as above it.

'In the UK our system is well equipped to deal with negative inflation shocks just as it dealt with the surge in commodity prices in 2010 and 2011,' he said.

'A few months of very low or even negative inflation, driven mainly by external factors, does not in and of itself mean that we run the risk of deflation.

'Core inflation, which strips out those factors, remains relatively stable and indeed rose slightly in the data.

'Even more importantly, expectations about future inflation remain well anchored and the latest data show that earnings growth is accelerating not slowing down.'

Labour's shadow Treasury minister Shabana Mahmood said: 'Plummeting global oil prices are the reason why the rate of inflation is falling here in Britain. 

'But wages continue to be sluggish and the squeeze on living standards since 2010 means working people are £1,600 a year worse off under this government.'
