The campaign arm of Congressional Democrats has raised more than $7.6 million since House Republicans announced a lawsuit against President Barack Obama last month.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign committee says it raised $1 million in a single day after newly elected Republican Whip Steve Scalise repeatedly refused to tell Fox News' Chris Wallace on Sunday that the House wouldn't impeach the president.

House Speaker John Boehner has said time and time again that the legal action the House intends to take against Obama is not a precursor to impeachment, but Democrats have continued to link the two together, causing headaches for Republican leaders.

And if the DCCC's banner fundraising is any indication, the strategy is working. Still, Democrats have a huge hurdle to overcome ahead November's elections if they are to win the 17 seats needed to take control of the House.

SCAM: Boehner said Democrats have cooked up baseless impeachment fears in order to raise money ahead of November's elections

DCCC Chairman Steve Israel said on Wednesday that his party's odds of taking back the legislative body have certainly been bolstered by Republicans' lawsuit and impeachment talk.

Republicans' 'accusations of presidential overreach have 
become a Republican overreach and that is motivating swing voters and 
persuadable voters,' Israel told CNN today, arguing that Republicans 'stepped into a mess on this.'

Israel said that as a result of Republicans' election year scheme to take on the president, Democrats are more fired up than ever.

'The phone calls, the emails, people signing up, wanting volunteer on
 campaigns, has surged literally over the past several weeks,' he said. 'Now it 
always surges as you get closer to an election, but I'm telling you the 
August numbers are what the Octobers numbers should be.'

The Washington Post reports the DCCC raised $2.1 million last weekend alone.

Even before Boehner announced the House's intention to sue Obama, the DCCC was having a lucrative election cycle. As of the end of June, the DCCC has outraised its Republican counterpart, the National Republican Congressional Committee, by roughly $23 million.

The DCCC also has more money in the bank - $50.9 million - than the NRCC - $42.5 million.

The House's lawsuit against Obama was meant to turn out volunteers and voters of its own. But so far, the strategy has backfired, giving Democrats the upper hand as they return to their home districts this weekend for Congress' month long recess.

Israel told CNN the House's lawsuit would be a major part of Democrats' campaign strategies throughout the next month and the fall.

'You bet we're going to run on a Congress that is just obsessed with 
lawsuits, suing the President, talking about impeaching him, instead of 
solutions for the middle class, talking about jobs and infrastructure,' Israel noted.

'You bet that we're going to ask people to support us based on that 
contrast.'

Smoking gun: The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee begged donors for money on Monday by floating the idea that Republicans could impeach the president

On
 Monday the DCCC emailed its 
largest donor list with a request for money based specifically on 
impeachment fears.

The 
president, vice president and first lady, the solicitation read, 'need 
your help, because it’s a critical moment. House Republicans will vote 
THIS WEEK to sue the President. And the White House believes it could 
lead to Barack Obama’s impeachment.'

'It’s
 time to have the President’s back. With the most critical deadline 
we’ve faced in just days, we’re still 75,000 donations short of our 
goal.'

Boehner lambasted the impeachment claims on Tuesday as 'a scam started by Democrats at the White House.'

'This
 whole talk about impeachment is coming from the president's own staff, 
and coming from Democrats on Capitol Hill,' Boehner told reporters.

'Why? Because they’re trying to rally their people to give money and to show up in this year's elections.'

Adding fuel to Boehner's contention, a top White House aide used the 'I' word on Friday during a Christian Science Monitor breakfast event, tying the threat of impeachment to a lawsuit Boehner is pursuing against the Obama administration.

The legal action, Dan Pfeiffer said, has 'opened the door' to a presidential impeachment.

'Impeachment is a very serious thing that has been bandied about by the recent Republican vice presidential nominee and others in a very un-serious way,' said Pfeiffer, hat-tipping former Alaska governor Sarah Palin.

'We take it very seriously and I don't think it would be a good thing.'

Palin said of Obama just days ago in Denver that 'if he's not impeachable, then no one is.'

Boehner has said plainly that his lawsuit, which focuses on the White House's unilateral changes to the Obamacare law, is not a prelude to removing Obama from power.

'This is not about impeachment,' the House speaker said on July 9. 'This is about faithfully executing the laws of our country.'

He added a more definitive statement on Tuesday, saying that the House leadership has 'no plans to impeach the president. We have no future plans.'

Staying: Obama doesn't face an impeachment threat, Boehner said, preferring to take the president to federal court over his administration's changes to the Affordable Care Act

Impeachment refers to a formal process prescribed in the U.S. Constitution for throwing a president or a federal judge out of office.

The House would first bring charges against Obama and vote to approve them. The Senate would then hold a trial on those charges and vote on whether to convict.

The Constitution reserves impeachment as a remedy for 'high crimes and misdemeanors,' which the framers understood to be official crimes committed while in power.

Boehner and other House leaders have tried to tamp down conservative Republicans' expectations in recent weeks.

A senior House staffer told MailOnline that Tuesday's words would be welcome in establishment circles since Democrats' control of the Senate makes removing Obama from office a guaranteed non-starter.

'It shouldn't have taken this long for him to say it, but now that he's said it we can get back to things that won't backfire,' the aide said.

A CNN/ORC International poll released on Friday found that one-third of Americans, 33 percent, believe Obama should be impeached and removed from office. Fully 65 percent disagreed.

Republicans' measure to sue Obama passed the House 225-201 on Wednesday.
