Google may have a host of Easter Eggs and special features, but Bing may have just stolen a significant charge against its rival.

The Microsoft-owned search engine now recognises searches made using just emoji - either when used on their own, or as part of longer typed search terms.

As well as searching for specific items, the search engine will additionally reveal what each of the emojis represent, or are based on.

Microsoft-owned Bing now recognises searches made using just emoji - either when used on their own, or as part of longer typed search terms. The engine can also create sentences using multiple emojis, such as 'Fuji apples', when an image of Mount Fuji and an apple are entered (pictured)

For example, the white circular food emoji with a pink swirl is known as Narutomaki and is a type of fish surimi from Japan.

The engine can also create sentences using multiple emojis, such as 'bridal shower', when an image of a bride and a shower are entered.

Emoji were originally popular in Japan, and widely used online, however, in recent years they have become hugely popular elsewhere.

Originally meaning pictograph, the word emoji literally means 'picture'
 (e) + 'letter' (moji).

Twitter allowed emoji to be used on its web version, as well across its apps earlier this year, and a study in April found that the top trending word of the year, so far, is emoji.  

Since then, its popularity has continued to rise.

Last month, London-based developers released the Emojli app.

It only lets users communicate using the popular miniature images - and even usernames have to be comprised of a selection of emoticons.

Meanwhile, Apple now lets users download keyboards to use on its iOS 8 devices, which includes the Keymoji app.

Keymoji converts any text into emojis as the user types.

In an official blog post, Nick Roberts, senior program manager of Bing Relevance and Intent said: ‘As you likely know, emoji are small pictures used to express an idea or emotion.

‘With the explosion of mobile devices and the ubiquity of texting, it has become a shorthand language used by billions of us around the world.

‘At Bing we want you to be able to search the same way you communicate every day.

‘Today, we are announcing the support of emoji characters in Bing search in all English markets.

‘With this new feature, you can search using your favorite emoji, and Bing will return results based on the semantic meaning of the emoji.’

Emoji were originally popular in Japan, and widely used online, however, in recent years they have become hugely popular across the globe.

Originally meaning pictograph, the word emoji literally means 'picture'
 (e) + 'letter' (moji).

Icons
 are standardised and include some specific to Japanese culture, such as
 a bowing (apologising) businessman, a face wearing a face mask, a white
 flower used to denote 'brilliant homework' or a group of emoji 
representing popular foods: ramen noodles, dango, onigiri, Japanese 
curry, and sushi.

Some 
emoji character sets have been incorporated into Unicode, allowing them 
to be used elsewhere in the world - and more could are expected to be added.

Users have the option of adding emojis mid-sentence along with their text, or replacing the text completely with miniature cartoon images.
