It's a university league table – but it has nothing to do with academic excellence.

The latest rankings on Britain’s higher education institutions reveal that the University of Roehampton is the UK’s most amorous campus.

Roehampton, in south-west London, romped to victory – with students getting intimate with an average of 6.32 partners since starting their courses, the survey showed.

A survey by a student website found the University of Roehampton was Britain's most amorous seat of learning

The result means a meteoric rise for the university which has jumped from 99th last year to 1st in this year's rankings.

Many students at Roehampton have been asking what or who is responsible for the dramatic surge.

Ciaran North, a student at the 
university, said: 'A large amount of it is already being attributed to 
this year’s freshers. This is a fair argument.

'If you are looking purely at the 
stats, you have to accept that something must have changed since last 
year, and why not blame it all on the freshers.

'After all, they are paying all that extra money to go to university, so why would they not make the absolute most of it?

'But there are alternatives. Maybe it took our second years a bit of time to settle in to their rhythm?'

Another theory is that with a ratio of one man to three women, the male students have been making hay while the sun shines.

Hot on the heels of Roehampton was 
Liverpool Hope (6.06), the Open University (5.91), the University of 
Dundee (5.55) and Edge Hill (5.53).

Coming last were the hard working 
students of Salford, who have only slept with an average of 1.35 people 
during their university careers so far.

Bangor, who topped the table last year, failed to live up to their name this year and slipped to a underwhelming 39th place.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the more successful students from the 'red brick' universities did not fare too well in the sex table.

Oxford came in 33rd place with a score of 4.17, Cambridge came 44th with 3.92 and LSE came 18th with 4.68.

Studentbeans.com interviewed 6,653
UK university students via an online survey between April 21 and May 1.

Oliver Brann, editor of studentbeans, said: 'University is often the time when young people have the freedom to explore, experience new things and express themselves, and that includes sex and relationships.

'Once again the north of England and Wales are well represented in the league table with Manchester Met and Aberystwyth University making an appearance in the top 10 for the second year running.'
