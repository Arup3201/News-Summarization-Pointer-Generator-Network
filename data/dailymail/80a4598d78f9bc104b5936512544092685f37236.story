Rubbish is piling up in Brighton as the seaside city's binmen continue their week-long strike.

Overflowing bins and boxes line the streets, with unions warning that the popular tourist destination would soon look like a ‘bomb site’.

Union and council officials were set to meet later today over disputes concerning pay cuts and work conditions after workers marched in the streets in protest over the weekend.

Piling up: Unions warn that the popular seaside tourist spot would soon look like a 'bomb site' as Brighton and Hove Council apologised to residents for the disruption

Brighton and Hove Council issued an apology to residents for the disruption today and have extended opening hours at their household waste centres.

On Twitter, the council wrote: ‘We are very sorry that our service is being affected during the dispute and will keep you up to date with developments.’

Residents also took to social media 
to post photos of discarded bottles and wrappers and to complain that 
waste in the area ‘stinks to high heaven’ over the weekend.

Among the tirade of ill-feeling on Twitter were moans about a waste of council tax money, and worries about health and safety.

One Twitter user wrote: ‘The rubbish on the streets of Brighton today is an embarrassment and health hazard.’

While another sarcastically thanked 
the council for issuing advice on how to deal with the smell: 
‘Brighton's rubbish men on strike for the next week. Council says we 
should prepare for the impending binpocalypse by double bagging. Thx 
(sic)!’

One resident, 
tweeting as 'Brighton Station', called for support for the city workers,
writing: ‘Big Hello to the Brighton Bin people who are on strike and 
marching today (Saturday). Please support them. #brighton.’

Meanwhile, fire chiefs have issued warnings of the dangers of uncollected rubbish.

Dave
Statham, watch manager at the Preston Circus station, said: ‘What 
starts as a small fire in a pile of rubbish can quickly escalate to 
involve nearby buildings and property with devastating effect.

‘I would remind property owners and 
occupiers of the importance of storing their refuse in a safe manner, 
away from buildings and consider the use of lockable commercial bins to 
try and prevent these incidents occurring.

‘In addition, to those that might be tempted to start fires in piles of rubbish and waste, I would remind them that arson is a criminal offence which, on conviction, carries a significant custodial and financial penalty, especially when it endangers people's lives.’

Brighton and Hove council’s refuse, recycling and street cleaners officially began their week-long strike over pay and conditions last Friday.

Caroline Lucas, MP for Brighton Pavillion, joined strikers on the picket line to show her support.

Mark Turner, GMB union branch secretary in Hove, said: ‘In my 29 years I've never seen a workforce filled with such anger, determination and passion.

‘Morale is up but equally it's not a position these guys want to be in.

‘They're not going to get paid for a week.

‘They are city residents too who have families to feed.’

Mr Turner urged the council to get back to the table and engage in discussions to bring an end to the chaos as quickly as possible.
