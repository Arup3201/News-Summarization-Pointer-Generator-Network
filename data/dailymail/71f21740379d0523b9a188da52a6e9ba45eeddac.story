The talk among England fans leaving Twickenham last Saturday was about predictable topics: a soporific second half and some erratic kicking.

But a new development at HQ was also under discussion: the giant television screens showing replays.

For some they represent the inevitable and welcome march of technology. For others they have the potential to have a malign influence the game.

The giant television screens at Twickenham had a significant effect on England's game against New Zealand 

Former England coach and Sportsmail columnist Sir Clive Woodward is among those who feel there should be strict protocols in place if England are to avoid criticism of abusing their home advantage at the 2015 World Cup.

Against New Zealand the constant use of big-screen replays — and the inevitable partisan reaction of England fans — appeared to play a part in referee Nigel Owens’s decision to yellow card All Black hooker Dane Coles.

It might also have contributed to Owens’s late decision to review New Zealand’s third try just before the conversion was being attempted.

Coach Steve Hansen was not impressed: ‘My biggest concern is not the TMO (television match official) or the refs. My biggest concern is that TV directors are starting to have an influence on the game.’

Woodward shares Hansen’s concerns, saying: ‘England have got to be really careful about home advantage and with my Olympic hat on I feel qualified to talk on this.

‘While you want to encourage massive home support there is a solid red line which you must never cross.

Nigel Owens stops Beauden Barrett from taking a conversion as he consults the TMO to check on the try 

‘You must never ever do anything which could be perceived in any way as influencing the result.

‘The London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games worked hard in 2012 to ensure fairness because it could have totally undermined the Games.

‘There would have been uproar in the athletes’ village and the media would have had a field day on reports of any perceived GB bias. The first thing that needs to be nailed down with the big screens is who makes the decision to show what and when. And then a protocol must be put in place.

'You must show tries from both sides the same number of times. You show alleged incidents of foul play the same number of times. You can’t have these “Come on England” signs flashed up. I sense Steven Hansen was annoyed on Saturday and so would I be if I was the visiting team.

‘Are referees influenced by crowd noise? Yes, definitely. Before an international I used to study refs much more than any opposition player because they have a much bigger influence on the game.

‘Assistant refs reporting to them are influenced by crowd noise. And then you magnify that by the crowd reacting to the big screen. ‘Sky has no say in what pictures go on the big screen, but if they choose to dwell on a try decision or an incident that is their editorial decision.’

Former England wing Mark Cueto is strongly in favour of the screens. ‘Big screens are here to stay,’ he says.

 ‘We had a couple of games at the start of the season at Sale without a big screen and it was an absolute killer in terms of the atmosphere. 

‘Everybody is standing around wondering what’s happening. If you are asking people to pay good money to support the game you can’t exclude them from all the key moments and drama which everybody else back home or in the bar is enjoying. When a big screen is available I would do something a bit radical and cut out the conversation between the referee and the TMO.

‘I hate all this, “Try or no try?” or “Is there any reason I cannot award a try?” stuff. The only question that matters is “What happened?”

‘The TMO should go through all the camera angles and then put the “money shot” up on the screen for the referee to decide. It puts pressure on the ref but everybody is under pressure on match day.’
