She's been flashing her Robert Procop diamond engagement ring since Brad Pitt proposed to her over two years ago.

But Angelina Jolie has been much more coy about showing off the wedding band from the 50-year-old Fury star.

However, that changed on Friday when the 39-year-old Unbroken director offered a good look at what is most likely her wedding jewelry when she signed autographs outside the Paley Center for the International Council Summit in New York City.

Proving she's definitely the new Mrs Brad Pitt: Angelina Jolie flashed her wedding band from her new husband while outside the Paley Center for the Media International Summit in NYC on Friday

Hello gorgeous: The 39-year-old Unbroken director offered a good glimpse of the wedding jewelry as she signed autographs on the street

Ring of truth: The band, or bands, consisted of diamonds and yellow gold

It appeared the Oscar winner was wearing one band with dozens of diamonds and textured yellow gold.

Or it could have been two bands that were stacked on top of each other.

It was too difficult to tell.

Previously the Wanted actress has been seen with just a gold band on her ring finger.

Brad has been seen with a wedding band since he tied the knot with his Mr And Mrs Smith co-star in August.

The two married at their residence Chateau Miraval in the South Of France with their six children - Maddox, Pax, Zahara, Shiloh, Vivienne and Knox - in attendance.

No glamor gown here: The Oscar winner, who wed Pitt in August, wore a grey blazer, black skirt and knee-high boots, making her look very professional

Nice purse: The Maleficent actress carried with her a large black designer handbag that screamed chic

Hello my fans: The newlywed appeared to be in great spirits as she headed to the Summit, where she was no doubt talking up her film which comes out Christmas day

Their wedding photos were shared in People magazine where it was revealed Jolie wore a veil decorated with drawings made by her children.

On Friday, Jolie looked business professional in a tailored grey blazer over a white blouse. A to-the-knee black skirt spelled no-nonsense. Knee-high boots added some sex appeal. 

The Maleficent actress chose an interesting time to reveal her new sparkler.

The night before Brad's ex-wife Jennifer Aniston heavily flashed her diamond engagement ring from fiancé Justin Theroux while at the LA premiere of her new film Horrible Bosses 2.

The 45-year-old hit maker constantly lifted her left hand to fix her hair, giving a good look at the bauble.

Angelina and Jennifer have not seemed to mend fences since they got into a cold war over Pitt over a decade ago.

Aniston split from the Legends Of The Fall A lister after he started filming the 2005 film Mr And Mrs Smith with Jolie.

The happy Pitts: The couple looked well groomed at the Sydney premiere of Unbroken on November 17; notice Brad was flashing his gold band from the beauty 

The engagement ring: The Robert Procop designed bauble Brad proposed with is seen here on the Gia star's hand in April 2012; she seems to have not been wearing it much since she said 'I do'

According to the latest issue of InTouch, Jennifer and Angelina will most likely face off during January's Golden Globes awards where each is expecting to appear.

Aniston is getting awards buzz for her turn in Cake while Jolie is getting talked up for her efforts on Unbroken, a heart-wrenching saga about Louis Zamperini's survival in a Japanese prisoner of war camp during WWII.

Pitt will most likely be working the awards circuit too as he handed in a good performance in his WWII epic Fury. 

The Pitts are currently co-starring in By The Sea, which is filming in Malta under her direction.
