Triple police killer Harry Roberts enjoyed a champagne-fuelled birthday party and trips to a bowling alley and restaurant while on day release from prison.

The murderer, who was jailed for life in 1966 for the murders of Geoffrey Fox, 41, Detective Sergeant Christopher Head, 30, and Detective Constable David Wombwell, 25, has been allowed periods of temporary release to reintegrate him with society.

Roberts received a minimum term of 30 years and was released three months ago after serving 48 years behind bars.

Despite the heinous nature of his crime, for which he has never expressed any remorse, Roberts was allowed out on temporary release back in 2001.

He was allowed to volunteer in an animal sanctuary in the East Midlands. At the time of his 65th birthday in July 2001, staff at the sanctuary arranged a secret birthday party and even arranged for a birthday cake and champagne. 

One source told The Mirror: 'Harry was in a good mood at the party. He wasn't aggressive or angry. He loved it. We had a slice of cake . He has a real sweet tooth and loves sugary treats like cake and chocolate. After that he got tipsy on champagne. 

'At one point he raised his glass and said, "Here's to freedom." Then he goes, "I cannot believe that the Home Secretary would let me out".' 

He also received presents of aftershave and socks.

Around that time he was also treated to a night out 10-pin bowling at the Hollywood Bowl centre in Chesterfield, Derbyshire.

He joked with friends as they fooled around with an electric shock machine.

The criminal had never been bowling before in his life, but enjoyed his trip telling friends he couldn't believe that the Home Secretary had let him out.

There was also a trip to a restaurant when the killer sent back a steak meal, saying he'd waited 40 years for the dish so wanted it to be perfect. 

The murders were committed just six months after the abolition of hanging. 

Roberts went on the run for six months after the triple murder and was found hiding in a barn.

Roberts was convicted of the murders of Geoffrey Fox, 41, left,  Detective Constable David Wombwell, centre, and Sergeant Christopher Head, right, in west London in 1966 - just six months after hanging was abolished

His trial judge described the crime as 'the most heinous in a generation'.

Gillian Wombwell, 67, whose husband David was murdered by Roberts said she was disappointed by the ease with which the killer was able to serve his sentence.

She said: 'As if it's not bad enough knowing he's free, these photos make me feel sickened and angry. He was hardly rotting away in his cell. He was sipping champagne and and enjoying 10-pin bowling. Is that the kind of punishment for a man who had killed three officers? These photos make me feel sickened and angry.'  

Roberts was jailed in 1966 for life for the murder of PC Geoffrey Fox, 41, Detective Sergeant Christopher Head, 30, and Detective Constable David Wombwell, 25. 

Following his release in November, it emerged that Roberts had earlier had a three-year long affair with a woman 27 years his junior, who claimed she broke his heart when she ended the relationship.

The 78-year-old triple killer met the woman who eventually dumped him, while he was serving his  jail term.

Roberts and the woman exchanged dozens of letters while the career criminal was in prison. He admitted that he wanted to move in with her whenever he was able to secure his release. 

The woman initially made contact with Roberts in 2010. When he responded, the killer claimed he wished he had never shot the three police officers as he would not have been in prison. 

Just one year before Roberts was eventually released, the woman told him it was over as she never expected that he would ever be free.  

According to the Sunday Mirror, the woman, who they called Susan, was incredibly nervous the first time she met Roberts at HMP Littlehey in Cambridgeshire. 

Susan claimed: 'Before I met him, I'd seen pictures of him on the internet, but when I met him he did look older than I imagined, but he didn't look like a really old man.'

The 51-year-old woman said they had made plans to live together if Roberts was ever released from prison. 

She said that at the end of their prison visits, she was allowed to 'kiss and cuddle' Roberts. 

She said: We talked about going off together. The problem was he didn't have any knowledge of when he would get out. He was just fighting always to get out.' 

Susan admitted that she loved Roberts and believed that the feeling was mutual. 

She added: 'I only found out Harry was going to be released from the news. It was a strange feeling as I always thought I would be the first one there to congratulate him. But my life has gone in a different direction.'
