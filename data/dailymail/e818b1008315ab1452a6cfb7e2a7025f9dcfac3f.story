A train company has admitted receiving up to 5,000 complaints a day.

Southern trains made the surprising confession yesterday after an irate passenger tweeted asking how many complaints it had notched up.

The company replied: ‘We are currently receiving between 2,000 to 5,000 tweets a day.’

Confession: Southern Trains admitted to receiving up to 5,000 complaints a day from frustrated customers

The online admission provoked a storm of criticism on social media, with a wave of angry commuters weighing in.

One person wrote: ‘Something to be proud of, huh?’, while another tweeted: ‘Which really demonstrates the level of dissatisfaction that we all have with the way you run the trains. Awful.’

Among the tweets Southern trains received yesterday was a flurry of complaints about its poor Friday morning service. One commuter posted: ‘Another bad start to a day. Not late enough to reclaim a tiny bit of my ticket but late enough to annoy my bosses.’

Another wearily tweeted: ‘Another morning. Another cancelled Southern train to Victoria. Another subsequently packed and annoying later train. Same old....’

A similarly frustrated passenger posted: ‘8:06 from Streatham Hill cancelled. 15 min wait then next train so packed some didn’t get on. Far from unusual.’

Rail watchdog Passenger Focus said the latest Twitter outcry amplified the findings of its own survey, in which Southern was ranked as one of the worst train companies for customer satisfaction.

Flooded with complaints: Three customers make their feelings about Southern trains clear on Twitter

Annoyed passengers: In a recently-published passenger satisfaction report from rail customer watchdog Passenger Focus, Southern was found near the bottom of the rankings

The only train firm with a lower figure in last autumn’s poll was Southeastern at 74 per cent, with Southern and Govia Thameslink scoring just 77 per cent. By contrast, the companies with the best scores were the Heathrow Express and Grand Central – both with 94 per cent. The average score was 81 per cent.

Here is a list of train operators along with the percentage of customers who say they are satisfied with their services. 

The figures come from a survey by Passenger Focus published on January 27 this year.

Heathrow Express: 94 per cent

Chiltern Railways: 91 per cent

Merseyrail: 90 per cent

First Hull Trains: 89 per cent

London Overground: 88 per cent

First Great Western: 81 per cent

South West Tarins: 80 per cent

Southern: 77 per cent

Southeastern: 74 per cent

Southern’s lowest scores in the Passenger Focus study were for how it deals with delays and availability of staff where only just over a third – 36 per cent – of passengers were satisfied. Passenger satisfaction with punctuality and reliability of the service fell 5 percentage points in one year to 68 per cent. Less than half were happy with the toilets provided, or the amount of space for luggage, while satisfaction with the helpfulness of staff fell to 53 per cent.

The watchdog’s director David Sidebottom said: ‘Our last survey showed that less than four in ten Southern passengers were satisfied with how the company manages delays. The increasing number of Twitter queries adds weight to this finding – it is now up to Southern to make sure it is communicating service problems clearly and accurately across all channels that its passengers use.’

Southern services have been one of many rail firms going to the capital struggling with continuing disruption caused by refurbishment at London Bridge station.

One Network Rail boss admitted he was ‘ashamed’ by the chaos affecting thousands of delayed and frustrated passengers. Rail minister Claire Perry also branded the delays there this week as ‘clearly unacceptable’.

A Southern trains spokesman said there were a higher number of complaints than usual, with the problems at London Bridge station ‘probably a factor’.

He added: ‘The figure of 2,000 to 5,000 a day referred to all tweets and included requests for information.’
