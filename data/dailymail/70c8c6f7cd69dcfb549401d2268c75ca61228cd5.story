These two rare tiger cubs, hand-reared from birth, were far from shy as they made their public debut today.

The five-month-old Amur tigers, named Kazimir and Arina, bounded playfully into their enclosure and nestled up to their 'father figure' keeper Ben Warren who has watched over them at Howletts Wild Animal Park near Canterbury in Kent after they were abandoned by their mother.

It is estimated that there are only 400 Amur or Siberian tigers remaining in the wild in north east China, eastern Russia and parts of North Korea.

Keeper Mr Warren said: ‘These cute cubs had a hard start in life, as their mum left them alone.

‘We made the decision to hand raise them so that they would get the nutrition and care that they needed.

‘This involved hand-feeding them both at
two-hourly intervals, constant supervision and regular medical checks 
by the on-site vet team at the wild animal park.

‘It’s great to see them doing well. They’ve both got huge characters.’

The female cub, Arina, has shown signs of a lack of bone mass, causing her to walk with a limp, and has already undergone surgery to correct it, which has been partially successful.

The tigers are endangered because of a loss of natural habitat as well as hunting for their striking coats and the false belief that their bones and teeth have medicinal properties.

Neil Spooner, animal director at the park, said: ‘It’s a sad fact that Amur tigers are endangered in the wild.

‘That’s why all births are so important. We need to ensure that these beautiful big cats continue to survive for generations to come.

‘It’s great to see how far Kazimir and Arina have come. They are really enjoying their new surroundings.’

Amur tigers grow up to 80 inches long and weigh up to 380lbs.

Bad bones: Arina has shown signs of a lack of bone mass, causing her to walk with a limp, and has already undergone surgery to correct it, which has been partially successful
