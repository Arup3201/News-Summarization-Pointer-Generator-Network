North Korea's internet connection has been cut for the second day in a row today, says a US Internet Research group tracking the country's connectivity.

According to Dry Research, North Korea's four networks supplied by the Chinese company China Unicorn were offline at 1541 GMT on Tuesday , reports AFP.

North Korea also lost internet connection for more than nine hours on Monday leading some to believe the US might be behind a cyber-attack in retaliation for the hack of Sony Pictures.

US Officials have blamed North Korea for the Sony Pictures hack and President Obama promised a 'proportionate response' to the alleged hack of the Hollywood film company.

The US has not come forward about the North Korean internet outage but online experts say that it resembles a 'denial of service' attack. 

The US State Department suggested on Monday that America may be behind the virtual attack on North Korea Yesterday. 

Very few people in the country have access to the internet, with connections often failing. However, the continuous problems reportedly being experienced led experts to raise the possibility that it might be under a cyber attack. 

Deputy State Department Spokeswoman Marie Harf reminded a reporter on Monday of Obama's threat to take action against North Korea while responding to a general question about the possibility that the country was undergoing a cyber assault

A spokesperson for State lent credence to the theory on Monday when she reminded a reporter of Obama's threat while responding to a general question about the possibility that North Korea was undergoing a cyber assault. 

'As the president said, we are considering a range of options in response,' deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf said. 

'We aren’t going to discuss, publicly, operational details about the possible response options — or comment on those types of reports in any way — except to say that as we implement those responses some will be seen, some may not be seen.' 

She added, 'So I can’t confirm those reports, but in general, that’s what the president has spoken to.' 

For nine hours on Monday, the hermit regime went completely offline. 

'It's as if North Korea got erased from the global map of the Internet,' Matthew Prince, president of internet security company CloudFlare, told CNN.    

The outage followed President Obama's public shaming of North Korea on Friday after the U.S. government definitively determined that it was behind the hacking of computers at Sony Pictures over the studio's new film, The Interview, which depicts the assassination of North Korea leader Kim Jong Un.

Doug Madory, director of Internet analysis at Dyn Research, said the internet connectivity problems were discovered in the last 24 hours and had gotten progressively worse to the point that 'North Korea's totally down.'

Internet connection was restored after nine hours on Monday but on 

Madory said one benign explanation for the problem might be that a router suffered a software glitch, though a cyber-attack involving North Korea's Internet service was also a possibility. 

'I haven't seen such a steady beat of routing instability and outages in KP before,' he told North Korea Tech. 

'Usually there are isolated blips, not continuous connectivity problems. I wouldn't be surprised if they are absorbing some sort of attack presently.' 

The outage comes just days after President Obama's public shaming of North Korea after the U.S. government definitively determined that it was behind the hacking of computers at Sony Pictures

Although very few citizens in North Korea have access to the internet, it allows the country's state media to link to the outside world.

The communist state's internet access is wired through China, which today, in a foreign ministry statement, said it 'opposes cyber attacks and cyber terrorism in all of its forms,' without referring directly to its ally North Korea.

The instability is in North Korea's main link, which runs through the northern Chinese city of Shenyang. 

Madory said this applied to North Korea's main Internet connection via Chinese company China Unicom, although it was possible the country had limited connection via satellite.

'All I can say is that in the last 24 hours, their communications have been degraded to a point where they are unable to communicate,' he said. 

'They have disappeared from the global Internet presently.'

Dyn Research monitors Internet performance though live feeds of router tables from about 450 telecommunications providers worldwide. 

Madory said North Korea's Internet connection has historically been stable, although it has come under attack in the past, including during a period of high tension with South Korea in 2013.

He said there were a lot of players - including potentially teenage hackers - who could mount a 'distributed denial-of-service' cyber attack on North Korea, if this were the cause of the outages.

'It doesn't need to be some big nation state,' he added.

Another Internet technology service, Arbor Networks, which protects companies against hacker attacks, said its monitoring had detected denial-of-service attacks aimed at North Korea's infrastructure, which started on Saturday and continued into today. 

Such attacks transmit so much spurious data traffic to Internet equipment that it becomes overwhelmed, until the attacks stop or the spurious traffic can be filtered and discarded to allow normal connections to resume. 

Washington has accused Pyongyang of being behind the hack that led to the release of embarrassing company emails and caused Sony executives to halt the debut of the comedy action film 'The Interview'

It is not immediately clear if the connectivity problems were an act of retribution for the hack that the FBI last week linked to North Korea. 

Distributed denial-of-service attacks are a relatively unsophisticated type of cyber warfare, in which a targeted computer system is bombarded with traffic, rendering it temporarily useless.  

Asked about the internet problems, North Korean diplomat Kim Song, said: 'I have no information.'  

Washington has accused Pyongyang of being behind the hack that led to the release of embarrassing company emails and caused Sony executives to halt the debut of the The Interview.

According to the FBI, there is 'significant overlap' between the Sony Pictures attack and other 'malicious cyber-activity' with direct links to Pyongyang, including an attack last year on South Korean banks blamed on the North. 

The hackers behind the attack on Sony Pictures said they were incensed by the comedy, and the studio pulled the film from distribution after major U.S. cinema chains declined to exhibit it.

The film about a fictional CIA plot to kill the country's leader infuriated North Korea, although Pyongyang has repeatedly denied it was behind the cyber assault. 

Despite calls from Republican critics for a robust response to the alleged hack, Obama told CNN in an interview that aired on Sunday: 'I don't think it was an act of war. I think it was an act of cyber vandalism that was very costly, very expensive. We take it very seriously.'

He also promised to 'review' the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism and potentially re-add North Korea, but added: 'We've got very clear criteria as to what it means for a state to sponsor terrorism. And we don't make those judgments just based on the news of the day.'

The White House declined to comment today and Harf refused to confirm or deny that North Korea had lost internet access because of a cyber attack.

North Korea has threatened to hit back at the White House and other U.S. targets if it was sanctioned over the alleged hacking.

Today Harf said of those threats: 'We have no specific credible threat information that leads credence to these reports.'

'Obviously, we take very seriously any threats to U.S. citizens, to U.S. companies, regardless of what that threat looks like.'

North Korea's National Defense Commission, in a statement on the official news agency, said the country's army and people 'are fully ready to stand in confrontation with the US in all war spaces including cyber warfare space to blow up those citadels.' 

Meanwhile, South's Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power Co (KHNP) began conducting drills at its four nuclear plant complexes today after a series of online information leaks by a suspected hacker.

The hacker, using an account entitled 'president of the anti-nuclear reactor group', published a variety of information on Twitter, including designs and manuals for two reactors as well as personal information on some 10,000 KHNP employees.

There did not appear to be any link between the drill and the Sony Pictures hack, and North Korea says it has never attempted or made a cyber attack on South Korea.
