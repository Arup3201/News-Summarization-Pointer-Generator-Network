This is the extraordinary moment a family of meerkats pulled together to save their newborn pups from a deadly snake.

The drama unfolded when a venomous puff adder invaded a burrow where five newborn meerkats pups were sleeping.

The meerkats, which are renown for living in tight-knit family groups, were forced to rally round and drag the babies from the burrow out of danger, but not before one female was bitten by the deadly snake.

Despite a serious injury to her leg the female continued to help and eventually carried all five pups to safety.

Photographer Robin Hoskyns from Leicester captured the commotion on camera.

Mr Hoskyns was working as a research assistant at the Kalahari Meerkat Project in South Africa at the time and said the event summed up the strength and determination of meerkats.

Robin said: 'Meerkat pups stay underground and don't emerge for up to three weeks until their eyes have opened and they are able to react to their environment a little.

'During this time the group generally leave up to three individuals to babysit at the burrow.

'On this particular morning I arrived at the burrow and sat down to wait, and waited, and waited.

'About three hours after the usual time for this group to be up, the sunrise had long gone and it was starting to get hot when I heard noises coming from the burrow.

'Suddenly the group emerged. Usually a group gets up casually one by one and they sit about at the entrance for a while to warm up before leaving but this time was different.

'It was a frenzy of meerkats coming up from different holes and popping back down again. After about 10 minutes of this activity I spotted a slightly purplish lump in the middle of the frenzy.

Rescued: The pups were transported to another burrow about 300 metres away

'At first I thought it was dead but I saw it try to raise its head. In the next 20 minutes they brought up two more pups and then another two, so five in total.

'The action was frantic but luckily I had my camera so I was snapping away trying to capture what was going on.

'At some point I noticed the dominant females leg was badly swollen and bleeding. Due to the swelling I predicted that it was a snake bite and sure enough when I managed to get a glimpse down the burrow I saw the head of a rather angry puff adder.

'The group at that time had four juveniles which were almost sub-adults who were all obviously very excited by everything that was going on and kept trying to pick up the pups which they could only just lift, moving them a couple of metres and running back to the burrow.

'This carried on for quite some time. Eventually the dominant female picked up one of the pups and made for the next nearest burrow, probably about 300 metres away.

'She eventually managed to carry all five pups to the next burrow almost by herself with a now massively swollen front leg. All the pups survived their ordeal and so did the dominant female.

'Looking back, it was up there with the top wildlife experiences I had in the past year as a meerkat research assistant.

'It was amazing to witness the strength and determination of that dominant female and I'm glad I took my camera out that day.'
