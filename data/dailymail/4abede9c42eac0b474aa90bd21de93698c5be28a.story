An Arizona six-year-old has broken the world record for the half-marathon in his age group after running a two-hour, 19-minute and 48-second half marathon.

When Cael Schwartz, six, heard that a six-year-old boy from Texas had run a half marathon, he decided that he wanted to run one, too.

He began training with his father Adam Schwartz, setting a personal record of two hours and one minute - a pace of about 10 minutes a mile.

Adam Schwartz ran alongside his son at the Desert Classic in Surprise along with 184 other runners.

The course was hard, said the elder Schwartz, with an incline in the first half of the race.

'It’s
 a pretty tough half-marathon course in that regard,' Adam told Arizona 
Central, 'so we fell about nine, 10 minutes short of our goal, but it 
was still a pretty impressive performance.'

Impressive
 enough, certainly, to break the previous world record, set by a 
six-year-old from New Orleans of two hours, 37 minutes and 34 seconds.

The record must be submitted to the Association of Road Racing, but it is expected to be accepted.

Adam Schwartz said the half-marathon was the longest race Cael has ever run

Cael, who loves competition and most sports, said he was just 'a little tired' after he finished the race.

'I
 felt good,' said Cael, who turned seven the day after the race. 'When I
 finished... I just couldn’t believe that I broke the record.'

Cael's interest in sports started with Adam Schwartz began competing in triathlons last year.

The
 then-five-year-old decided he wanted to compete in triathlons too. He's
 planning to run in six triathlons this spring in preparation for the 
main event.

'My next goal is to win the national championship in triathlons for seven-year-olds in August,' said the determined athlete.

Competitive edge: Cael loves competing and does triathlon, wrestling and half-marathons

Cael, the eldest of three boys, has made his his father and his mother, Michelle, very proud with his dedication.

'Both of us through this journey have choked up on occasion,' Adam Schwartx told Arizona Central.

'It’s a pretty neat experience and it’s not one you get to have very often. To be able to share it with family and friends is a very neat experience for us.' 

Cael wants to run another marathon soon, after he's given his legs a rest. But in the meantime, he plans to take up wrestling.
