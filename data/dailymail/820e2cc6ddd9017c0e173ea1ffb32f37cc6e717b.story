An NYPD officer was caught trying to fast-track a woman's recruitment in return for sexual favours, it is claimed.

Prosecutors say Delfin Lantigua contacted the budding police officer on Facebook and said he could get her hired - but only if she gave him 'multiple instances of sex', $1,000 and her underwear.

Shocked by the alleged offer, the woman told police who fixed her up with a wire tap and met the Lantigua at a Brooklyn branch of Dunmkin' Donuts on March 11.

Arrest: Prosecutors say 34-year-old Delfin Lantigua demanded sex, $1,000 and the woman's underwear in exchange for getting a budding female police officer hired to the NYPD. He could face seven years in jail

Lantigua, who has been with the NYPD for nine years, was arraigned yesterday on charges of third-degree bribe receiving, second-degree coercion and official misconduct.

He faces up to seven years in prison if convicted.

Brooklyn District Attorney Ken Thompson said: 'This defendant shamefully violated his duty to uphold the law by demanding sex from a woman who simply wanted to become a police officer.

'He will now be prosecuted for his outrageous conduct.'

DA Thompson said according to the investigation, Lantigua, who worked with the Brooklyn North Task Force, contacted the applicant on Facebook on February 9, 2014.

Officers claim that during the follow-up meeting at Dunkin' Donuts he demanded regular sex, $1,000 and 'other conditions', which are believed to refer to her underwear.

She agreed to meet Lantigua, who lives in Kensington, New York, at a motel two days later where he thought they were going to have sex.

But instead, when he arrived he was arrested by officers from the NYPD's Internal Affairs Bureau.

Lantigua reportedly worked in the applicant processing department of the NYPD, where he handled candidates' details.

His defense attorney Stephen Flamhaft suggested he would contest the case, telling theNew York Daily News: 'It’s my belief that this entire thing appears to have been orchestrated by the police department.'
