Bacon has topped a list of Britain’s favourite 100 foods, ahead of chicken, chocolate and delicacies such as duck and lobster.

Britain’s first ever Top 100 Food Index is a comprehensive study into what now makes up our favourite tastes.

One in ten Brits named the breakfast and sandwich favourite their top food, followed by chicken and chocolate in second and third spots.

Nation's choice: Bacon has been voted Britain's favourite food in the first ever Top 100 Index

The entire list ranges from the everyday - baked beans, jam and apples - to more exotic foods such as sushi and spices like ginger.

Meat dominated the top 10 with steak, beef and lamb also featuring.

The research, commissioned by Food 
Network UK, found that the banana is now Britain’s favourite fruit, 
coming in at number eight on the list, ahead of apples.

Bananas are now our favourite fruit

And asparagus is our preferred vegetable, at number 14 in the list, with artichokes coming second at number 19.

The study, carried out among 2,000 adults, also suggests we are not a nation of sweet tooths with ice cream, the top ranked favourite dessert, down in 27th.

Salmon was voted the top fish, in 15th, ahead of anchovies in 24th.

And chilli would seem to be our preferred spice, in 22nd.

Quintessentially English spread Marmite was voted 35th favourite food.

The study indicates bacon may retain top spot for years to come, with more than two thirds (67 per cent) of Brits saying their favourite food has been the same for the past ten years.

Meanwhile, a third claim they could eat their favourite food every single day without ever tiring of it.

British ingredients dominate with asparagus, blue cheese such as Stilton and strawberries making the top 20 and two-thirds claiming they use more British ingredients than 10 years ago.

Although some more exotic foods are represented, such as chorizo, mango and lobster, the majority are more traditional fare, with bread at number 7.

Not to everyone's taste: But anchovies (24th) and Marmite (35th) both ranked highly in the survey

Food Network UK chef Andy Bates said: 'The study shows we tend to be quite traditional and safe with our tastes - leaning towards ingredients considered staples rather than more unusual, luxury ingredients.

'We definitely favour foods we’re more familiar with but also those that are affordable, simple and versatile.'

Nick Thorogood, Managing Director of Food Network, added: 'We are seeing a resurgence of British ingredients, including asparagus and black pudding - along with many others that made the Top 100 Index.

Exotic: Foreign delicacies such as Spanish chorizo (39th) and Japanese sushi (58th) are also popular

'It will be interesting to see how this list evolves in the next few years - Food Network UK aims to inspire people to try new foods but also new ways of cooking with existing ingredients.'

Bacon, which contains Vitamin B1, B12, Zinc and Selenium, is one of the oldest processed meats in history - the Chinese began salting pork bellies as early as 1500BC.

It is so popular that pigs from Yorkshire and Tamworth are bred especially for bacon.

The phrase ‘to bring home the bacon’ comes from the ancient country fair sport of catching a greased pig. The winner kept the pig and ‘brought home the bacon’.
