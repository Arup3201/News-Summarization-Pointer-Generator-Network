Becks' fluorescent peroxide blond hairstyle from 2007 was voted his biggest style shocker in a poll

He may be a champ on the field, a doting father to four children and dutiful husband, but David Beckham is less successful when it comes to fashion.

From garish hairstyles to bizarre clothes choices, he's committed his fair share of 'embarrassing dad' style crimes.

Ahead of his 40th birthday in May, a new poll has revealed Becks' worst fashion fails.

His biggest style shocker was his fluorescent peroxide blond hairstyle when he was playing for Real Madrid in 2007, which contrasted starkly with a slight burned tan.

In second place is the matching his-and-hers Versace leather outfits worn with Victoria Beckham  in 1999.

In third place was the famous cornrow hairstyle from 2003, which showed off inches of pink scalp.

The dodgy sarong Becks showcased  at the 1998 World Cup while again out with his wife - complete with clunky leather slide-ons - came fourth.

In fifth place was his now deeply unfashionable 'curtains' haircut he had during the years when he was first dating Victoria back in 1996. Plenty of  gel meant his locks were permanently shiny and finely separated.

And in sixth place was the bushier beard he grew five years ago, which looked more 'I haven't slept in days' than stylishly manly. Thankfully, the football star prefers to crop his beard more closely these days.

The father-of-four is often considered somewhat of a British style icon, but as well as often hitting the right note, he's certainly tried and failed many times.  

His seventh biggest howler was the spiky highlighted hair he had in 2002 shortly before leaving Manchester United. 

In eighth place was his Mohican haircut from 2001 and coming in at ninth place was the disastrous, misspelled Sanskrit tattoo in tribute to his wife Victoria from 2002. When translated, it spelled 'Vihctoria'.

Another hairstyle from Becks' Madrid years is his tenth fashion fail - this time, it was the ponytail he wore to control his growing locks in 2003. 

Becks' fashion disasters were chosen in a poll of 1,000 people by the menswear brand Theidleman.com. 

Beckham has freely admitted to some spectacular fashion fails in the past - not least those leather jackets. 

He has said: 'What were we thinking. I look back on some of the stuff and think, "I can't believe I actually wore that."

'I have no regrets, though - I knew at the time it was good! 

'Maybe I've sometimes overstepped the mark with something that a footballer in the past wouldn't wear, and that's led to trends or people trying new things. 

'Some people would probably look at me wearing the sarong - that's been mentioned so many times over the years. But I thought it was great.' 

David's famous cornrow hairstyle (left) from 2003 was voted third worst look and his deeply unfashionable gelled 'curtains' haircut (left) from 1996 came in at fifth place

In sixth place was the bushier beard he grew five years ago, which looked more 'I haven't slept in days' than stylish (left) and his seventh biggest howler was the spiky highlighted hair he rocked in 2002 (right)

Beckham is a firm champion of self-expression, which sounds like a promise of further fashion howlers from our national hero. 

'Everyone should be allowed to be who they are and dress how they want,' he said.

Becks said he was adventurous with fashion choices even as a child. 

He explained: 'I was a pageboy and had a choice between wearing a boring old suit or a pair of knickerbockers with ballerina tights and slippers. I went with the tights.' 

Oliver Tezcan, founder of British young menswear e-tailer The Idleman.com, said Beckham remained a style icon for millions of men and he should be applauded for his boldness when it comes to fashion.

Tezcan said: 'Beckham has done more to improve the dress sense of British men than probably any other man this century.

10 The ponytail haircut he had while playing for Real in 2003.

David's Mohican look (2001)was only voted eighth worst fail, while his misspelled 2002 tattoo came in ninth

Becks' tenth fashion fail is the double ponytail he wore to control his growing locks in 2003

'But it is notable that only one of his top ten fashion fails has come in the last five years - his rather unfortunate bushy beard. 

'The fact is, Beckham is now a father-of-four who will be celebrating his 40th birthday in May. 'He looks as good as ever but there is no doubt that his sense of style is becoming far more conservative. 

'He changes his hairstyle a lot less frequently and has a well-cropped beard more or less constantly.

'You can't imagine him ever having a Mohican again or going platinum blond. 

'I'd love to see the sarong-wearing Beckham re-emerge in his 40s to shake things up again. 

'I guess you have to ask whether the big brands he represents these days want one of their ambassadors sporting a Mohican.' 

As he approaches the big 4-0, Beckham's sure to have lots more style blunders up his sleeve.
