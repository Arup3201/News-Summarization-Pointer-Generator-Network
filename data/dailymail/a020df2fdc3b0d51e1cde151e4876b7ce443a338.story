Tragedy: Fletcher Kenned died within 24 hours of returning home from hospital after doctors said his poor health was 'wind', an inquest heard

A bereft mother has been forced to relive the harrowing moment she tried to revive her dying newborn baby hours after medics sent him home saying he had wind, an inquest heard today

Gemma Smith, 35, claims she told hospital staff three-day-old son Fletcher Kennedy was grey, grizzly and not feeding properly but a Lancashire maternity unit believed he was fine and discharged them.

Just a few hours later Gemma was watching TV with Fletcher's father Sean Kennedy when the infant made a noise in his Moses basket as if he had taken his last breath, she said.

She desperately gave her son mouth-to-mouth and he was rushed into a different hospital but was pronounced dead shortly afterwards.

Today Miss Smith spoke out at her son's 
inquest where she and her partner claimed doctors at Burnley General 
Hospital should not have allowed Fletcher to go home.

But a coroner has ruled that doctors were right to send a newborn baby home, even though the child died just eight hours later.

'He was grey in colour he just looked poorly. He would only settle if he was upright, he seemed uncomfortable. We had to keep him upright all the time,' she told the hearing

'When he was born on the Thursday he was a lovely pink, big chunky baby. On the Saturday he was a totally different baby.

'He had been grizzly all night. He looked a totally different baby. Everyone commented that it was not the same baby. I had a photo of him taken that morning, he was not looking a healthy pink colour he looked grey.

'Everyone thought I was putting pictures of him up after he had died, I said no that was before.'

Tender: Fletcher's father Sean kisses his son in the minutes after his birth but he later turned grey and grizzly, his parents said

Bereft: Gemma Smith, pictured while pregnant with Fletcher, said within 24 hours of returning home her son was distressed and struggling to breathe

Moving: Fletcher's mother said 'all of a sudden I heard him make a noise', which she told the hearing sounded like his last breath

The hearing was told Fletcher had been born on February 14 last year weighing 7lb 7oz and at 39 weeks after Miss Smith underwent a Caesarean section, as she had done when giving birth to her two previous children.

Miss Smith was told by midwife that upon his birth Fletcher looked healthy but he had a low set of ears and a small chin and a fat pad on the back of his neck.

The secretary from Burnley said: 'I was a bit shocked because I have read up on all sorts of things when pregnant and I had never heard of a low set of ears. I asked if it was a problem and she said that he would need to be referred to paediatrician. It was only briefly mentioned, when the paediatrician came round to do the checks I mentioned it and he said 'no it's fine - no concerns'.'

'Fletcher was feeding fine for the first 24 hours. He was brilliant, he took it every two hours, he was perfect. But he gradually stopped over the next 12 hours. He didn't want to know, by Friday evening he wasn't feeding, he was constantly crying. He was very, very unsettled he wasn't feeding at all.'

Blame: The parents say staff at Burnley General Hospital should not have discharged the baby when he was struggling to feed

The inquest was told Gemma told a midwife her son wasn't feeding but added: 'She said that the baby of this size was a bit hit and miss with breastfeeding and to carry on persevering because he had fed.

'I was getting stressed. I thought he must be hungry. They said it was quite normal not to feed they didn't seem concerned. I wanted to breastfeed, this was the first baby who actually took to it.'

Family: Sean with Fletcher in hospital where he was born via C section and there were no concerns or any difficulties within the pregnancy

She added that the nurses put it down to the baby being 'windy.' Miss Smith said: 'How can I have a windy baby if he has not eaten? I don't remember him passing urine. I told the nursing staff he was wasn't weeing.

'I monitored his nappies, on the 15th I kept three nappies at the bottom of the bed. I asked the midwife to check them, they were bone dry but she said they felt alright and threw them in the bin. All they kept saying, he had wind. That's what they put it down to.'

The hearing was told hospital notes claimed Fletcher was passing urine and 'gulping milk.' Further notes taken later recorded noth mother and baby were sleeping following breast feeding and at 3.40am that Fletcher had been unsettled for a few hours.

The inquest heard hospital notes recorded the baby being 'a good colour, clear eyes and skin'.

Gemma was discharged from hospital at 4pm onÂ  February 16 and family visited later that evening.

But she said: 'Nothing settled him. I sent Sean to go and get some milk. He wasn't feeding, he was still crying lots. We got him a bottle. He didn't take the bottle, he wasn't opening his mouth, he was pushing away. He was a really funny colour.'

The couple decided to bath him to try and settle him. Miss Smith said: 'He seemed to cry less but obviously he was on a downward spiral. It wasn't a cry, it was more of a dull cry, he was whimpering. I thought 'we have cracked it, it seems to be calming down'. We decided to stay downstairs with him that night.'

She added that he was placed in a Moses basket and they watched him and Sean watched a film in the early hours of February 17.

Miss Smith said: 'I could hear him making a noise, all of a sudden I heard him make a noise (demonstrated like a last gasp of breath). I said to Sean to ring the ambulance he has stopped breathing. I whipped him up. I was trying to blow into his mouth trying to give him air. I knew from picking him up he had just gone limp.'

Innocent: Gemma and Fletcher were discharged from hospital on February 16 last year but the next day he fell ill and an ambulance was called

He was taken to Blackburn Hospital where he died at 3.01am after attempts to resuscitate him.

Neonatologist Dr Chi Ning Mo claimed in a medical examination Fletcher appeared healthy. Dr Mo said: 'I found him to be a well looking baby, he had been reported to be breastfeeing well, he was pink.

'He did have a heart murmur but normal heart sounds, no breathing difficulties, liver not enlarged. He did not look to have any unusual features..

'He didn't strike me as unusual in any way. He cried when he was disturbed but did settle once given something to suck. He behaved as a newborn baby would do'.

Midwife Lola Wild said: 'Nobody raised any concerns to me about the baby's colour. After 24 hours they can become paler, it's not uncommon, the only difference I saw was the large fat pad on the back of the neck, other than that he seemed healthy to me and I had no other concerns.

'I have no recollection of Gemma raising concerns about her or her baby. We would advise to save the nappies if parents have got concerns I don't recall seeing them.'

Returning a death by natural causes East Lancashire coroner Richard Taylor: 'Indeed the loss of a child is always a terrible thing whatever the age of the child, but in four-days of life, our hearts go out to you.

'What then occurred after the first 24 hours with Fletcher, as in mum's evidence was he did well with feeding and sleeping but then concerns were expressed of lack of wee, feeding and sleeping. It is very noticeable that none of the health care specialists thought these concerns were worthy of note or delay in discharge.

'I didn't find that it was unreasonable to discharge Gemma and Fletcher. No one suggested there should've been any delay after checks on him.

The conclusion I have to return is one of natural causes, all we can say is that it was an unknown medical cause, the medical cause of death was not fully established.'

Speaking after the inquest Fletcher's dad, Sean Kennedy 27, said: 'If I have another child there is no way I'm going to believe the things they say but I'm sure they won't have this happening again. I hold the staff accountable for this, it is a total disgrace.'

The inquest continues.
