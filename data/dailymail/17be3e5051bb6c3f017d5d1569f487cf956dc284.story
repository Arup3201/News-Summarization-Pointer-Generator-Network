He may have been accused of being Photoshop and been mocked on Saturday Night Live, but Justin Bieber clearly has the golden touch.

The young heartthrob's recent Calvin Klein campaign boosted the brand's social media credentials immensely.

According to WWD, the designer brand has amassed 3.6 million followers across its social media channels ever since Justin - alongside Lara Stone - was unveiled as the face of its Spring campaign.

If that wasn't enough, the campaign's hashtag #mycalvins generated 1.6 million Twitter mentions in the first 48 hours; that's five times the amount of #breaktheinternet mentions that Kim Kardashian and her bare derriere accumulated for Paper Magazine. 

Despite his naysayers, the Believe singer has revealed that he worked extremely hard to whip his body into shape for his latest gig.

The 20-year-old singer claims that he exercised intensely with his trainer.

He said: 'I work out with my trainer, Patrick Nilsson, five days a week for about 45 minutes each.

'We do three-days splits: back and triceps one day, chest and biceps on day two, shoulder and legs on day three, and abs every other day.

'I'm not on a special diet, but I do try to watch what I eat. I do eat unhealthy sometimes - I am a 20-year-old guy!'

Justin today reunited with Hailey Baldwin as the duo were spotted riding in a black vehicle together in Los Angeles.

The two certainly weren't trying to go under the radar, rolling down the tinted windows to give a clear view inside the vehicle.
