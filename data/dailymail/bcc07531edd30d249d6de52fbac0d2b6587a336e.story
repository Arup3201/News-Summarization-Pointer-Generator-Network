A eye doctor in Orlando is suing his former fiancée for the return of a wide array of gifts that he now claims are rightfully his since he paid for them.

Divorced Claude 'Jack' Parker III treated Kimberly Herbstritt, an employee at his eye center, to a $60,000 diamond engagement ring when he proposed in 2012.

During their time together Parker, 56, showered his fiance with other gifts including a $70,000 Porsche and a Weimaraner dog that cost $3,500 to train.

Three months ago Herbstritt moved out of Parker's 5,400-square-foot home in Longwood, Florida, after breaking off their engagement.

Last month he filed a lawsuit and is suing her for the return of not only the ring, Porsche and dog, but also his Keurig coffee maker, two ladders, a $400 flower arrangement and $2,350 worth of Christmas decorations and tablecloths from Pier 1.

Herbstritt isn't willing to hand the gifts back and on Monday her attorney filed paperwork asking for the suit to be dismissed. 

She argues that Parker has provided nothing in writing to show that he owns the items. 'It's my stuff,' she told the Orlando Sentinel.

Parker has refused to comment on the legal action, but according to the suit he wants the 31/2 diamond carats ring he gave Herbstritt when he proposed on her 47th birthday returned because he paid for it.

Among the items that Parker and Herbstritt are fighting over is a Weimaraner dog, pictured, that he claims he paid $1,500 for and then invest another 43,500 on 'extensive training'

According to his personal profile on his business' website, Parker enjoys boating, fishing, working out, and he has a special interest in fast exotic cars.

According to the suit, the Porsche he bought Herbstritt this year is jointly registered in both their names. 

The father of two college age sons also says the dog he bought Herbstritt is worth $5,000 after he paid $1,500 and then invested another $3,500 on 'extensive training.'  

Parker divorced his wife in 2009, while Herbstritt started working at his clinic in 2008.

According to the suit, the couple hadn't set a wedding date and Herbstritt left without advance warning when she moved out on September 16.
