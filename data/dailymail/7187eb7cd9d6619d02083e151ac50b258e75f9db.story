Pope Francis admitted he has fallen asleep during his bedtime prayer

Pope Francis has admitted nodding off while praying at the end of a long day, but said he thought God ‘understands’.

The pontiff was appearing before 200,000 people gathered in St Peter’s Square when he made unscripted comments on subjects ranging from memories of his grandmother, his decision to become a priest and political corruption.

To laughter from the crowd, he described how he prays each day before an altar before going to bed.

'Sometimes I doze off, the fatigue of the day makes you fall asleep, but he (God) understands,' he said.

Calling
 on Catholics to do more to help the poor and needy in society he went 
on: 'If we step outside of ourselves, we will find poverty.

'Today, it breaks my heart to say it, finding a homeless person who has died of cold, is not news.

'Today, the news is scandals, that is
 news, but the many children who don’t have food - that’s not news.

'This
 is grave. We can’t rest easy while things are this way.'

The crowd, most of whom are already involved in charity work, interrupted him often with applause.

'We cannot become starched Christians, too polite, who speak of theology calmly over tea.

'We have to become courageous Christians and seek out those (who need help most),' he said.

Francis, the former Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio of Buenos Aires, said the world was going through not just an economic crisis but a crisis of values.

'This is happening today. If investments in banks fall, it is a tragedy and people say "What are we going to do?"'.

'But if people die of hunger, have nothing to eat or suffer from poor health, that’s nothing. This is our crisis today. A Church that is poor and for the poor has to fight this mentality.’

The Pontiff told a crowd of 200,000 people about his moment of shuteye, but said he thought God understands that it's hard to stay awake after a tiring day

Pope Francis delivered an off the cuff speech. Today, he celebrated Pentecost mass in St. Peter's Square

He was speaking after meeting German Chancellor Angela Merkel to discuss Europe’s economic crisis.

Apparently
 responding to his criticism of a heartless 'dictatorship of the 
economy' earlier in the week, Merkel, who is up for re-election in 
September, later called for stronger regulation of financial markets.

On
 Thursday, Francis appealed in a speech for world financial reform, 
saying the global economic crisis had made life worse for millions in 
rich and poor countries.

The crowd in Rome laughed as the Pope told some light-hearted anecdotes. The Pontiff said mass to celebrate Pentecost day, which falls 50 days after Easter
