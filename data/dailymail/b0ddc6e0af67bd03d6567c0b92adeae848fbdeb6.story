A woman convinced she was suffering a bout of hayfever has been diagnosed with a brain tumour, leaving her unable to walk.  

Beth Frazer, from Valley in Anglesey, visited her GP three times, complaining of suffering headaches.

But each time her doctor sent the 20-year-old away with hayfever remedies, to try and treat her symptoms.

When Miss Frazer's condition worsened she was sent for rounds of rigorous tests.

A brain scan revealed a growth, leading doctors to diagnose her with a cystic brain tumour. 

Beth Frazer, 20, from Anglesey in North Wales, has been diagnosed with a brain tumour after becoming convinced her symptoms were the result of hayfever. She noticed a her left eye had drooped, right, and is now confined to a wheelchair, unable to walk, left

Miss Frazer, a student at the University of South Wales, now requires round-the-clock care, the brain tumour having left her wheelchair bound and unable to walk.   

She said: 'I feel like a 90-year-old trapped in a 20 year-old's body.

'I feel like an old lady suffering with arthritis because sometimes my body is just so sore.

'My life is nothing like it used to be I was so independent before my diagnosis and now I have to rely on other people every day.

'My family and boyfriend have become my carers and I can't go anywhere without someone being with me.'

The singer and songwriter began suffering with symptoms in June this year.

After weeks of tests and brain scans, she was finally diagnosed with a pineal cystic tumour.

But due to the location of the cyst doctors warned her that surgery was not an option.

She is now plagued with health problems including extreme fatigue, anxiety, chronic headaches, insomnia, extreme upper body stiffness and pain, and sensitivity to light.

She said: 'I had always suffered with bad hayfever and when it began in June I just thought it was worse than normal this year.

The musician visited her doctors three times but was sent home with hayfever remedies, before further tests and a brain scan revealed a growth on her pineal gland

Doctors warned Miss Frazer that due to the position of the tumour, they will be unable to operate

'I had the usual watery and itchy eyes but then one day I woke up and my left eye had completely drooped down.

'My eye drooped down with my hayfever symptoms for a week or so but came to themselves after a couple of hours.

'I had started to get really bad headaches as well to the point where I couldn't be in any light because it would be so painful. 

The pineal gland is located in the brain and is responsible for secreting melatonin.

Pineal cyst tumours are rare and are normally benign.

Commonly the tumours are diagnosed using MRI scans to detect the growth.

Symptoms often include problems with eye movement, headache, nausea and vomiting and double vision.

Pineal region tumours represent less than one per cent of all primary brain tumours, however three to eight per cent of childhood brain tumours occur in the area.

The tumours tend to be diagnosed in young adults, aged 20 to 40.

Various treatments are used, including radiotherapy and chemotherapy to reduce the size of the tumours.

Surgery can be possible in some patients, to remove part of the growth or insert a shunt to relieve pressure caused by the tumour.

'I was sent to A&E, eye clinics, and two different hospitals for tests but it wasn't until they did the highest strength MRI that they found the tumour.

'We literally came the full circle because when I first went to doctors they said it could be one of three things, inflammation on the brain, a bleed on the brain or a tumour.

'But after the MRI and CT scans came back with no worrying results they ruled out a brain tumour, but that's exactly what it has turned out to be.

'It was hard to be told it wasn't a tumour and be relieved that it wasn't to then be told it was and have to then try and deal with that.'

Miss Frazer has been told by doctors that due to the location of the tumour they are unwilling to do surgery as the nine-hour procedure is too risky.

The once outgoing student is now on constant pain relief medication to try and keep her symptoms at bay.

Doctors at the Walton Centre in Liverpool are also unable to determine whether she will regain use of her legs.

Self-employed musician Miss Frazer, said: 'Doctors told me that I am the first person they have seen with this type of cyst that has lost use of their legs.

'I was able to walk with an aid at first but my legs are just too weak now and I need a wheelchair to get around.

'I feel sorry for my family and especially my boyfriend who I live with because he is now not just a boyfriend but he is now my carer.'

She has now set up a fundraising page with the hope of raising £150,000 to go to America to see the world's leading experts on pineal cystic tumours.

She said: 'It was hard to be told it wasn't a tumour and be relieved that it wasn't to then be told it was and have to then try and deal with that. I was able to walk with an aid at first but my legs are just too weak now and I need a wheelchair to get around'

She will also be undergoing cosmetic surgery to correct her left eye.

'I want to get treatment and be able to come out the other side of this and be able to walk and drive and just be a normal 20 year old again,' she said.

'I miss singing as I used to do a lot of gigs and I want to be able to get back to university and continue with my music industry course.

'We have raised near to £4,000 already and I am so grateful to everyone who has donated I just hope it continues so I get as close to my target as I can.'
