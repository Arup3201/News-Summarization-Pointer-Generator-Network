This is the picture that nearly cost a teenager his life when he plunged 2,500ft down a mountain after stepping back to fit a bit more scenery in his shot.

Jack Fox, 14, from Southport, fell on the last run of the last day of a school skiing trip in the Alps during half-term.

He suffered ice burns to his arms but miraculously survived the ordeal relatively unhurt.

The costly picture: Jack Fox took this snap the moment before he fell on the last day of a school skiing trip in the Alps

Jack's injuries: Despite bouncing off rocks and ice during the fall he only needed treatment for ice burns on his arms after his jacket was pushed up to his elbows during the plunge

Jack's iPhone 4S, containing the last picture he took, also survived the fall.

He said: 'The battery goes quite quickly now, but there is not a crack on it. After I had stopped falling I just saw it there and tried to turn it on but it wouldn't. Then, when I got to the hospital and it had dried out, it turned on.'

Mum Amanda, 41, said Jack was disappointed the phone still worked.

Jack had hoped the accident would land him a phone upgrade but his old mobile survived

She said: 'Jack has been after an iPhone 6 for ages and when it wouldn't turn on, he thought he was going to get a new one.

But we are glad it came on because that was when he first spoke to me.

 'My husband had been told that he had been airlifted off, but we didn't know about any injuries. His phone coming back on was like it was meant to be.'

Jack said: 'I was facing forwards taking pictures of the scenery, and I was about to put my phone away when I started to slip and lose my footing. I was shouting for help as I was falling – but then I couldn't because I had snow in my mouth.'

Most of Jack's horrified friends feared the worst as he tumbled down the mountain.

Amanda added: 'Jack said when he got to the bottom of the mountain he knew he hadn't broken anything as everything moved.'

At the top of the mountain, Jack said a lot of people had taken their helmets off to take photos. His mum Amanda said: 'Luckily he hadn't, because his helmet was all smashed. Kids think helmets are not cool but Jack has now realised that they are.'

'It was cracked and bits had fallen off it,' said Jack, 'As I was going down I was trying to stop myself by digging my boots in, but it flipped me over and hit my head – it was a scary experience and was the first time I've ever thought I was going to die.'

He added: 'You do need a helmet. It has saved my life.'

After being airlifted off the mountain near Salzburg, in Austria, Jack was later treated at Alder Hey Children's Hospital for severe ice burns.

He said: 'As I fell, my jacket pushed up to my elbows and I got to one point when I started to slow down and I moved over on to one arm because the other one was hurting. That is when the left arm went bad.'

Amanda said Jack's left arm was 'quite a mess'.

She added: 'He is lucky to be here. It could have been a totally different story.

'He is here and can tell the tale, which is the important thing.'

Jack feared the snap had cost him his life and said for the first time ever he thought he was going to die during the experience
