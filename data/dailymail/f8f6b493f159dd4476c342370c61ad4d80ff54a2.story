A stag party sparked an overnight search operation costing £8,000 after taking boats out on a river for a boozy session.

A witness called the coastguard just 
after midnight saying he was concerned the 20 men were drunk and not in 
control of the four 16ft day boats on the Helford River in west 
Cornwall.

But an extensive search involving two lifeboats and a cliff rescue team failed to locate them as the group had made their way to bed by the time the rescue attempt was in full swing.

The next morning Nick Bailey, of Helford River Boat Hire, who had rented them the boats for a weekend of fishing, found them at their accommodation in Port Navas.

He said: 'I was furious and they were 
severely reprimanded. They acted contrary to all the instructions I'd 
given them. I warned them not to take the boats out after dark and not 
to consume alcohol.

'But they took it upon themselves to take them just after 5pm when we had left, and hit the pub pretty hard.

'The
next morning they were very apologetic and swore the skippers were 
sober. It would appear they were fine and the boats were tied up 
firmly.'

Wasted resources: The operation by coastguards and a cliff rescue team cost around £8,000

Mr Bailey took away the boats and ended the hire contract saying it was the first time in seven years anything like this had happened.

James Instance, of Falmouth coastguard, said: 'We received a report the men were worse for wear and not in a fit state to be in the boats.

'The people acted irresponsibly on boats late at night, which caused concern for their safety and triggered quite a large response. We had volunteers out overnight.'

Tamsin Thomas, of the RNLI, said: 'Every time there's an incident we always react, we don't judge.'
