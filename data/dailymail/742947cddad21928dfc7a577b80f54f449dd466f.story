Firefighters worked to protect hogs in one building as a fire burned through another, killing over 4,000 baby pigs at a North Carolina farm.

Emergency responders arrived at 700-acre Deerfield Farms in Eagle Springs around 11 p.m. Wednesday to find the nursery already in flames.

Aberdeen Times reports that 10 emergency teams were on the scene working to put out the blaze as well as keep it from spreading to other structures or setting nearby propane tanks on fire.

Water needed to be shuttled onto the farm  down the mile of dirt road where the farm is located because there was no sufficient water source on the farm itself.

Though fire officials said the fire was eventually controlled, about 4,200 pigs housed in the nursery were killed.

The pigs ranged from 14 to 45 pounds.The animals are not considered hogs until they reach about 120 pounds and are ready to be butchered at about 220 pounds.

'It smelled bad,' said Eagle Springs Fire Department Chief Marshall Nall. 'It didn't smell like what you're going to eat at a restaurant.'

'When you have animals confined indoors they're not able to escape from problems like this,' said Gene Baur, president of Farm Sanctuary, a non-profit that opposes factory farming. 

The USDA categorizes facilities that house more than 1,000 animals for more than 45 days in a year to be a Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation, or CAFO.

According to officials, the pigs were valued at $400,000 and the structure was $600,000.

Officials are still investigating the cause of the fire.
