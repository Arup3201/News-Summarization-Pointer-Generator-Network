Russia is going on a huge military shopping spree for warplanes, tanks, missiles and submarines as tensions with Nato and the U.S. continue to escalate.

Kremlin demand boosted Russian arms companies' sales by more than a fifth last year compared to the year before, according to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

Russia's top 10 weapons makers had combined sales of £31billion in 2013, SIPRI's research revealed, placing the country behind the U.S. and the UK in the list of biggest arms-selling nations.

The increase in the revenue of Russian arms makers is largely due to Moscow's 'ongoing project to strengthen indigenous arms procurement,' SIPRI says.

This summer the Kremlin announced it will spend about $600billion on its state armaments programme by 2020 to upgrade and modernise its military capabilities.

The rise in sales comes after an even bigger increase registered the year before, 2012, when SIPRI said Russian arms makers' revenues were up 35 per cent.

The military modernisation programme comes despite an economic crisis in Russia worsened by Western sanctions and plummetting oil and gas prices.

Russia's has the world's third highest defence budget, having doubled its military expenditure since 2004. Spending on the military is set to rise by 85 per cent between 2012 and 2017, CNN Money reported.

The Kremlin's spending is still dwarfed by the world's biggest players, however. China spent twice as much as Russia on its military last year, while the U.S. spent more than seven times as much.

Growth industry: Sales by Russian arms makers were up 20 per cent between 2012 and 2013, even as sales by other countries' arms industries slid, according to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute data

CNN Money reports that the Kremlin has 'airfields, hundreds of fighter jets and a new fleet of battle tanks ... in the works', as well as eight new ships ready by 2020 and a new advanced nuclear submarine already delivered. 

The figures come from SIPRI's index of the 100 leading arms companies, published today. The 100 companies had global sales of a mammoth $402billion last year, which despite three years of declines remains 45.5 per cent higher than the total figure for 2002. 

SIPRI's index excludes Chinese arms companies due to a lack of data. 

Russia and the West are more at odds than at any time since the end of the Cold War.

Russia accuses Europe and the U.S. over engineering a right-wing coup in Ukraine, while Nato says Moscow is providing material support to partisans opposing Kiev's new regime.

Meanwhile, Nato allies have accused Russia of stepping up military activity around Europe.

British Foreign Secretary Micheal Fallon yesterday accused Vladimir Putin of playing a ‘provocative and dangerous’ game by ordering Russian Bear bombers to fly near British waters.

Mr Fallon said Mr Putin’s new aggression could even spark a war with Nato forces. In a blunt message, he said Britain should ‘prepare for the worst’ as the Russian President flexes his muscles.

SIPRI says the crisis in Ukraine could help boost Russian arms sales.

Aude Fleurant, research director at the institute, told CNN Money reporter Ivana Kottasova: 'It is too early to say, but the conflict is likely to have an impact on some specific orders - especially conventional ammunition.'

Siemon Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms and Military Expenditure Programme, said: 'The remarkable increases in Russian companies’ arms sales in both 2012 and 2013 are in large part due to uninterrupted investments in military procurement by the Russian Government during the 2000s.

'These investments are explicitly intended to modernise national production capabilities and weapons in order to bring them on par with major U.S. and Western European arms producers’ capabilities and technologies.'
