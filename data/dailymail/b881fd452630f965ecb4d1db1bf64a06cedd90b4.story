Which is the best football league in the world? Best not just for the fans but for the players, and the clubs, and the national game in each country?

That is a question that The Mail on Sunday have tried to answer using objective measurements of a wide range of factors as part of the most in-depth study of global football ever conducted. We have considered 34 leagues around the world, from England to Australia and back via Europe, Africa, Asia and the Americas.

We have looked at each league’s income and wages paid out, goals, ticket prices and attendance, ‘stardust’ and talent production, managers, trophies, competitive balance and contribution to the national game.

Manchester City are the Premier League champions, but is the English league the best in the world?

Points were assigned to every league for every category — and added up to see who comes out on top. The Premier League emerges top by the tiniest margin over the Bundesliga, a debate-provoking result if ever there was one.

TROPHIES

While fans of the Bundesliga wax lyrical about the brilliance of Bayern and the wonders of cheap tickets and beer on the terraces, Germany's top division hasn't pulled up many trees in the past decade in Europe, winning the Champions League once and the Uefa Cup / Europa League not at all.

Two major leagues have dominated Europe over the past decade when it comes to sticking major continental silverware in the trophy room: Spain and the Premier League.

La Liga teams have won the Champions League four times, had a further runners-up slot, won the Uefa Cup five times and been runners-up in that twice.

Premier League teams have won three Champions League finals over the past 10 years - one apiece for Liverpool, Man United and Chelsea - and had another five as runners-up: Arsenal, Liverpool, Chelsea and Man Utd twice. Chelsea have also won the Europa League while Premier League middle-rankers (at that time) Middlesbrough and Fulham have been runners-up.

Taking into account continental trophy wins over a decade around the world, Spain and England's top divisions are well ahead of any other leagues, with Bundesliga in third place just ahead of Italy's Serie A in second, then Brazil's top division (dominant in Copa Lib.), then Mexico, Portugal, Argentina, Russia, Ukraine and Japan. See table for details.

MANAGERS

Only one football league in the world in 2014 could boast a club manager who has won both the World Cup and the Champions League among his career honours - and it's not the Premier League, Bundesliga, La Liga, Serie A or Ligue 1.

The league in question is the Chinese Super League (CSL), the manager is Marcello Lippi, and the CSL's collection of leading bosses does not stop with the Italian.

Lippi has just retired as the boss at Guangzhou Evergrande, the CSL champions and 2013 Asian club champions. Sven Goran Eriksson, former Serie A winner and European Cup-Winners’ Cup winner (as well as former England manager) is also working in the CSL, at Guangzhou, and there is former winning manager of the South America’s Champions League equivalent, the Copa Libertadores in the CSL - that’s Cuca of Brazil. The former Argentina manager Sergio Batista is also there.

The CSL is therefore one of four leagues in the world who in 2014 have collectively employed most of the world’s best managers between them - the other three being the Premier League, the Bundesliga and La Liga.

‘Best' in this case is not just a subjective tag. As part of MailSport’s wide-ranging study of the world’s best leagues, we have scrutinised the trophy records of managers across 34 leagues around the world, awarding points for every trophy of genuinely major significance. These are the World Cup, the Champions League and equivalent, major continental season-long trophies such as the Europa League, and league titles in England, Spain, Germany and Italy.

Each trophy win has been assigned a points value, from 10 points for a World Cup win or Champions League win to three points for winning one of those four league titles to 1.5 points for winning the continental club titles in Africa or Asia.

The points totals for each manager have been added up, and the points totals for the managers in each league combined have been added up. The accompanying table shows the 12 leagues with at least one 'world class' manager.

By this measure, the Premier League has the best trophy haul among its managers, Jose Mourinho leading the way with a supporting cast headed by Louis Van Gaal. The Bundesliga is next, with Pep Guardiola the star man, then La Liga (Ancelloti) and the CSL (Lippi) with Brazil’s top division next (Big Phil Scolari) and Serie A (Rafa Benitez).

This table considers big-time winners in major competitions. If you've 'only' got a runners-up medal in a major tournament, or 'just' a national cup to your name - forget it.

COMPETITIVE BALANCE

The Premier League title has been the preserve of a handful of clubs over its entire 23-year existence and the past decade has become more exclusive still, with just three different winners in the past 10 years and just five different teams even featuring anywhere in the top three at the end of the season.

Those five - Manchester United, Chelsea, Man City, Arsenal and Liverpool - represent 25 per cent of the Premier League, and that figure (just 25% of teams in the top three in a decade) is the lowest proportion in any league in the whole of world football.

Some leagues are less competitive in terms of different winners in a decade: Olympiacos have won the Greek title in nine of the past 10 years; the same is true for Dinamo Zagreb in Croatia. Shakhtar Donetsk have won the Ukraine title eight times in 10, and Porto have won in Portugal seven times in 10, and Basel seven times in 10 in Switzerland. These leagues are virtually one-horse races most seasons. In fact only two teams have won in each of those leagues in the past decade, as is the case in Scotland.

That makes this group, along with the Premier League, Spains’s La Liga and Italy’s Serie A (also just three winners each over decade) the least competitively balanced nine leagues in MailSport’s 34-league study. And even these other leagues have more teams getting inside the top three than in England (see table).

While the Bundesliga has been and remains dominated by Bayern Munich (six wins in 10 years), it has at least had four different winners in a decade and eight teams in the top three. The honours in France have been spread further still with six winners of Ligue 1 in a decade and nine teams finishing in the top three.

The most competitively balanced of the ‘big’ leagues (18 teams or more) are the Championship (eight winners in 10 years, or 33% of teams, no team more than twice, and a staggering 22 different teams in the top three), Mexico’s Liga MX (seven winners in 10 years), the J-League in Japan (ditto) and MLS (ditto).

In the ‘small’ leagues of 16 or fewer teams, Sweden’s top division has been most competitive with eight winners in 10 years, followed by the top divisions in Australia, Norway and China, with six winners in 10 years.
