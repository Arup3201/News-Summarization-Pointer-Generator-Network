It’s amazing enough that two teenage lesbian lovers allegedly stole an estimated $30,000 in cash and electronics as they burgled 29 homes.

But what makes the story of these 19-year-olds even more incredible is that they claim to have been greeted by a lion inside one of the homes.

Harley Rose Gifford and Britney Singleton, of Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, have been stealing iPods, jewellery and money since July, police said.

‘If we find a lion it will be a bigger story than this,’ Upper Darby Police Superintendent Michael Chitwood told the Philadelphia Inquirer.

Police have not yet verified the girl’s claim about a lion - as nobody was home at the house in Cardington, Pennsylvania, when they went to call.

Detectives have dubbed the lovers ‘the Thelma and Louise bandits’ after the 1991 crime film starring Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis.

They looted the homes, left them ransacked and either walked or took public transport home, Superintendent Chitwood said.

Recovered: They allegedly stole jewellery, iPods, toys, toiletries, trainers, make-up, purses and other household items, as well as around $23,000 in cash

Most of Gifford and Singleton’s crimes happened in broad daylight and they even took a 55-inch TV back to their apartment on foot, police said.

‘They just enjoyed stealing,’ he told 
the Philadelphia Inquirer. ‘They used people's homes as their own 
private shopping centre.’

In addition they took a .22-caliber revolver, knives, a Sony PlayStation, a Nintendo Wii, baseballs and even a Virgin Mary statue, police said.

Police say they also found a hookah pipe and marijuana - but are not expecting these items to be reclaimed by their original owners.

‘This was their shopping spree,’ Police Captain George Rhoades told the Philadelphia Inquirer. ‘They took whatever they could get their hands on.’

Detectives had thought the girls might be supporting a drugs habit - but eventually concluded they were ‘just thieves, pure and simple’.

One alleged victim, Curtistine Willis, claimed to ABC that the home she shares with her 12-year-old daughter was ransacked.

‘They went through my medicine and they took my medicine,’ she said. ‘The medicine cabinet was destroyed, so it was really bad.'

Gifford and Singleton were arrested at their flat on Thursday night and taken into custody. They were arraigned on Saturday.

They were arraigned on charges of 25 counts each of burglary, criminal mischief and trespass, theft and receiving stolen property.

The alleged burglaries happened between July 16 and September 13, reported the Delaware County Daily Times.
