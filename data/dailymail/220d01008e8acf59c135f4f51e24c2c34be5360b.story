A huge manhunt has been launched for a suspect in the murder of a guest house landlady, police revealed today.

Detectives searching for John Heald, 53, say they are concentrating on the Rotherham area of South Yorkshire after members of the public reported sightings in the town and in nearby Mexborough.

The public have been warned not to approach him as police consider him 'a dangerous man'.

He is wanted in connection with the murder of Bei Cater, 49, who was found dead at Morayland Hotel, Marshall Avenue, Bridlington, East Yorkshire, late on Friday night.

Humberside Police revealed he is also wanted in connection with a serious offence in Rotherham.

Mr Heald, who is from South Yorkshire, was believed to have been staying at the guest house before she was killed. 

Detective Superintendent Mathew Hutchinson, leading the search for the wanted man for Humberside Police, said: 'There have now been reported sightings of John Heald in Rotherham and Mexborough and we have officers on the ground here to locate him.

'John Heald is a dangerous man and he needs to be found and arrested as a matter of urgency.

'He is wanted for a serious offence in the Rotherham area as well as for the murder of Bei Carter in Bridlington and I believe that people here in this local area know him and may well know where he is.

'It is absolutely imperative that anyone who has seen this man or has any information about his whereabouts calls the police now and tells us what they know.

'To anyone who might be helping Heald evade the police, I would say; consider your actions, this is a very dangerous man, he needs arresting before he can harm anybody else.

'I believe Heald poses a threat to the general public and therefore people should not approach him. If they do see him they should ring 999 immediately.

'Anyone with information can also contact the Major Incident Team on 01377 208989 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.'

South Yorkshire Police's District Commander, Chief Superintendent Jason Harwin, said: 'We are working closely with our colleagues in Humberside Police to quickly locate and arrest this individual.

'Additional officers are being deployed to support the investigation and to provide reassurance.

'However, the support of the public is essential in this investigation. He has contacts in this area and I would urge anyone who sees him to contact police immediately.'
