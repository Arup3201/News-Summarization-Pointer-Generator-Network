Should Manchester United sign Juan Mata?

Wayne Rooney was pictured arriving at Manchester United's Carrington training base on Tuesday morning in a boost for the ailing champions.

The England striker, whose future at Old Trafford is uncertain, hasn't played for David Moyes’s side since their 2-1 home defeat against Tottenham on New Year’s Day.

Rooney was sent to Egypt to speed up his recovery from a long-standing groin injury and returned to training at Carrington on Friday last week.

And his presence is sure to 
provide a timely boost to United ahead of their Capital One Cup 
semi-final against Sunderland on Wednesday.

Rooney’s absence from the first team 
has coincided with United’s woeful run which has seen them lose four of 
their last five matches and slump to 14 points behind table-toppers 
Arsenal.

Ahead of his side's defeat by Chelsea at the weekend, Moyes was coy on a potential return date for the England striker.

'He's back and he's looking good but he's not ready for this game,' Moyes said in his pre-game press conference.

'He's done some running on the grass and I don't want to put a date on his return but I've watched him running and he's in good condition. He's kept himself right while he's been away.'

Another huge boost for Moyes is that Robin van Persie is expected back in training this week.

The Holland striker had a huge influence on United's title-winning campaign last season, but this term he has been hampered by a recurring thigh injury.

The return of United's two talismanic strikers could provide the stuttering champions with a renewed confidence with games against Arsenal, Olympiacos and cross-town rivals Manchester City on the horizon in the coming months.

Meanwhile, Sunderland goalkeeper Vito
 Mannone believes his side, who carry a 2-1 aggregate lead into the Old 
Trafford second leg, are in with a genuine chance of reaching the 
Wembley final.

'Wednesday is another game and a 
massive one for the club and the fans,' the former Arsenal stopper said.
 'We need to focus on the semi-final again as we did in the first leg.

'We are not afraid of anything. We 
are unbeaten in quite a few games. I think we have lost one in 11.

'We’re
 not supposed to go there afraid. We go there 2-1 up with a slight 
advantage, but it is a new game and we have to treat it as if it is a 
new game and the score is 0-0.

'You don’t need any motivation to go 
to Old Trafford, you just need to belief you can win and if we do that 
we will perform better.'
