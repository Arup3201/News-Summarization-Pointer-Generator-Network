There’s something in Nathan Cleverly’s eyes that’s making me even more excited about this rematch between him and Tony Bellew. 

We all know this is a grudge match and that they don’t like each other. They hate each other, really. But I always had a bit of a thought that the spite was mostly coming from Tony’s side. For two years it’s all he talks to me about: ‘I want to fight Cleverly.’ He’ll constantly tell me how much he hates him, can’t stand him, even the look of him. He has nothing but violent thoughts towards him.

With Nathan, I’ve always had the feeling it was maybe a bit more relaxed. This rematch was always on his agenda and it was a big part of our conversations when he signed with us. Then, after he and Bellew won in Liverpool earlier in the month, I saw a slightly different side. Bellew got up close, they nearly went for it and I saw in Nathan right there that he was willing to go, at ringside.

He wanted to fight right there. He wants this fight as much as Tony does. As a promoter this is good and bad. If this spills out of control, it will be bad for all of us. These guys are role models and it has to happen in the ring. But on the other hand, when the grudge is authentic and the fighters are well matched, then you have something special. I'd say there is much more venom in this than Carl Froch- George Groves.

I think this fight will be something special. At the moment I am going over some of the final logistics. I’m down to two main options – November 29 in the Echo Arena or November 1 at the MEN in Manchester. Manchester will hold more, about 20,000 versus 12,000, but my instinct is leaning towards Liverpool. I have to take my hat off to Nathan, he went to Tony's back yard before and he is willing to do it again but ultimately the numbers will decide.

I can reveal here that I'm working to ensure this fight is a final eliminator for a world title, even though I believe the winner AND loser will go on to fight for a world title. Title or not, this fight is huge.

I have signed Matthew Macklin and his first outing for Matchroom will be on August 30 in Dublin against Jorge Sebastien Heiland. It will be a WBC eliminator, with the winner moving within one fight of Miguel Cotto. It’s a huge bout for Macklin. We sold out at the box office after a few minutes.

Heiland is a tough, live opponent. He is ranked No 4 and Macklin is No 9, so he has a tough night ahead. He came to us a few weeks back wanting an opportunity and now he has it. 

Although Andy Lee was on the radar, this WBC opportunity could set up a final eliminator with Martin Murray - what an enormous fight that would be. All roads had seemed to lead to Lee for Macklin, but while that would have been a huge fight in Ireland, this is the best way to a world title. 

For us, Macklin opens up the markets in Dublin and the Midlands so fans there can expect more shows.

On board: Matthew Macklin has signed for Matchroom Boxing and will fight in Dublin on August 30

On the same Dublin bill, Anthony Joshua will fight Yaroslav Zavorotnyi. This is a step up that I hope will get him some rounds. The challenge we are facing with AJ is that he is destroying everyone we put in front of him, regardless of their credentials. He is that good.

This fight ought to test him. This guy went 10 rounds before losing on points to David Price, a big puncher, and has only been stopped twice, once against Nikolai Valuev and once in a European title fight. He is tough, has fought top fighters and has stopped 14 of his 16 victims. This fight will give us a good comparison with David Price, as that’s a fight we are looking at for the future. 

Our plan is to win this fight, then fight Michael Sprott in London on October 11. Then we go for a big name. It might be Sam Sexton, Tyson Fury or Dereck Chisora. It might be Price. 

My personal opinion is that he would beat any of those now. But this is a special talent and we are managing him correctly. At the moment we are taking him around the country and the crowds are just amazing. Everyone wants to see him fight and rightly so. He is growing every fight.

Chisora-Fury is off due to a late injury suffered by Chisora. I mentioned earlier about the value of a proper grudge match. I’m not sure I ever saw that in Fury versus Chisora. After months of head-to-head press conferences the fight failed to live up to expectations at the box office and never really captured the public's imagination.

I like Tyson, he’s a good guy. I have met him and he seems a decent fella in a sport that needs characters. I’d never tell him to completely change but as a role model in the sport he often over steps the mark and loses a bit of control, hence why the BBBC have been talking to him lately about his behaviour.  

It looked to me like sometimes he is pressured into behaving wildly in the build up to this fight to try and sell it. They had such a long lead up and so many head-to-heads that they always needed to say something new and exciting. It just didn’t feel very real and I think the punters can see through that.

I thought that Fury would have won that fight and looked good in doing so.

The Commonwealth Games are wonderful for amateur boxing but they are good for promoters as well. It’s competitions like this and the Olympics and world championships where promoters will have an eye on who the emerging talent is. 

At Matchroom we have always committed to young talent and I think it was a huge coup for us to get the likes of Anthony Joshua and Luke Campbell, two Olympic gold medallists, after 2012. 

Going into these Games, I think the two guys making the most noise are Antony Fowler and Andrew Selby. They have had excellent amateur careers and I think they will be good pro prospects as well. Fowler reminds me a bit of Carl Froch in his style and work ethic– he is really good to watch. And Selby looks like one of the very best amateur talents to come out of this country. 

I’ll be keeping an eye on them and so should you.
