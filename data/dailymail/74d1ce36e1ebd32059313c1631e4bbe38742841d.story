Supporters of the policeman who shot Michael Brown have launched a campaign to put up a billboard in the city backing the officer.

The campaign was launched by a supporter from Tennessee last month and has already raised the $3,000 goal to erect the sign.

Plans are for the billboard to read 'Pants Up, Don't Loot' - a phrase made popular by National Review in response to the chant 'Hands Up, Don't Shoot' recited by Brown's supporters.

What could go wrong? This is the design for the billboard that the supporters of Darren Wilson want to erect in Ferguson

The campaign website says it intends to erect the sign in the 'heart of Florissant' where many of the violent protests have taken place.

Although the $3,000 target has been reached, the billboard has not yet been purchased, it was noted by TPM Livewire.

According to the campaign website: 'The funds collected from this campaign will be used to purchase this billboard for as long as possible.

'Whatever funds we receive will go directly to keeping the billboard campaign up as long as possible.

Vocal: More than 100 people donated more than $3,000 to the fund to purchase the billboard supporting the controversial officer

'If we come to an agreement with a company and can fund it for 3 months, 5 months, 7 months... we will.'

Fortress America identified Don Alexander of Tennessee as the campaign founder. He told them: 'Whatever funds we receive will go directly to keeping the billboard campaign up as long as possible. If we come to an agreement with a company and can fund it for 3 months, 5 months, 7 months..., we will.'

The billboard is arguably incendiary and in terrible taste considering the situation currently in Ferguson.

Outrage: People took to Twitter to complain about the billboard - which they want to erect before the grand jury announcement 

Support: Some of the public have sympathized with Officer Darren Wilson and have taken to social media to express this fact

'Hands up' of course refers to Michael Brown's alleged surrender to Officer Darren Wilson and 'Pants up' to the fashion for wearing low-on-the-waist trousers as popularized by hip-hop aritists.

Most people who donated money did so anonymously and it is estimated that more than 100 did so.
