'DIY king': Philip Dickens, pictured, admitted his company, Baumhaus, supplied an unsafe item

A furniture boss is facing jail after his company produced a cot that nearly caused the death of two young children.

Philip Dickens admitted his company, Baumhaus, supplied an unsafe item at Aylesbury Crown Court, Buckinghamshire, today.

The firm produced the Nutkin cot bed which was blamed for incidents where two children 'came very close to very serious harm or death,' the court heard. 

Dickens, described as 'the king of DIY' on a profile on the Baumhaus website, could now face a jail sentence or a fine of up to £20,000.

The site says the solid hardwood Nutkin cot, a modified version of which is still being sold, is suitable for children aged 0 to 12 years as it 'transforms easily from cot into stunning sleigh bed.'

It says the cot is 'extremely versatile' and can be set to three different heights.

In 2013, Baumhaus released a product recall for the original design of the cot, explaining that parts of the bed, particularly the gaps at the top, had been identified as a potential trap-hazard.

A notice published online by consumer watchdog Which? said there is a 'risk of children trapping their head and neck in the gaps at the top.'

It added: 'A child's legs or arms could become trapped between the end slat of the drop-down side of some products sold.' 

The company, which produces a number of ranges of furniture, has since modified the design and it is available from a number of retailers for around £500.

Appearing in court today on behalf of Baumhaus, Dickens was told he could face up to 12 months behind bars or a fine of up to £20,000 for the offences.  

Baumhaus recalled the cot bed in December 2013. 

At the time, consumer watchdog Which? released a notice detailing the risks presented by the bed, advising readers to stop using the cot immediately. 

The risks included: 

Alex Greenwood, prosecuting the case on behalf of the Trading Standards Institute, told the court, sitting at Amersham, Buckinghamshire, that Baumhaus and its director had been neglectful.

Mr Greenwood said: 'As a result, three individuals received that product and used it. In the case of two children they came very close to very serious harm and/or death.

'They placed it on the market and it was subsequently supplied and the incidents occurred.'

Entering pleas on the company's behalf, Dickens pleaded guilty to two counts of placing an unsafe product on the market between January 2010 and July 2013.

Dickens was referred to personally in one of the charges. 

Mr Greenwood said: 'This is a small company. He is the director. Anything that has been done is attributable to his neglect.'

Judge Karen Holt told Dickens they were 'serious' offences.

She said: 'You know what happened to those two young children. All options ought to be considered.'

Dickens, from Burnley, Lancashire, was released on bail to return for sentencing on April 13.
