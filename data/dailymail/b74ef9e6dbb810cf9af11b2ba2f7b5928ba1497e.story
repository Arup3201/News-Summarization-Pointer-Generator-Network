China has become the world’s largest source of international tourists – but it appears they are leaving London off their itineraries.

New research from CityMetric Intelligence suggests that Chinese tourists are skipping the UK capital – one of the most popular destinations in the world – in favour of places such as New York, which has six times as many visitors, Los Angeles and Moscow, the most popular destination in Europe.

That means London is missing out on a massive amount of business as the market for Chinese holidaymakers was worth an estimated $129bn (approximately £82bn) in 2013 – accounting for 11 per cent of the global tourism industry, according to the study.

It is estimated that the market could be worth $310bn (approximately £200bn) in 2018.

In terms of long-haul destinations, London ranked a distant 22nd with just 94,162 visitors from China in 2013 – well behind New York, which topped the list with 646,000, even though it requires a longer flight.

The second most popular long-haul destination was Los Angeles with 570,000 visitors, followed by Sydney (387,000), Moscow (376,500) and Melbourne (303,000)

London also found itself behind Dubai (275,675), Venice (242,059) and Paris (226,068).

Overall, Seoul had the most visitors in China in 2013 at more than four million

When factoring in cities that are closer to home for Chinese holidaymakers, London ranked 33rd on the list, which was topped by Seoul with more than four million visitors from China.

Bangkok was second with more than three million, followed by Singapore with more than two million.

The CityMetric Intelligence report suggests that Chinese tourists are skipping London because it is more difficult to obtain a visa for the UK than neighbouring countries, and due to the fact that the UK is not a member of the Schengen zone that allows for free travel within Europe under one visa.

But it says there are signs that the numbers have improved in 2014 and the UK government is taking steps to lure Chinese tourists amid calls for the visa regime to be simplified.

It has made it easier for them to obtain visas and in September announced plans to refund the cost of 25,000 visas for Chinese tourists visiting the UK in organised tour groups.

This is in addition to an increased marketing push in the world’s most populous country.

Robin Johnson, the director of the China Project at Visit Britain, told CityMetric: ‘We’ve stepped up our activity considerably in China over the past 18 months to further increase visits, not only to London, but crucially across the whole of Britain.’

He said the average Chinese visitor spends more than time and more money in Britain than in other European countries, and is more likely to travel outside the capital to other destinations in the UK.
