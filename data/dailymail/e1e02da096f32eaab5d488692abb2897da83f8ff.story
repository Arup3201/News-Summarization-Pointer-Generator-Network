Fashion statement: Vogue editor Anna Wintour is rumoured to be about to 
become the next Ambassador to London

Anna Wintour was keeping tight-lipped over rumours that she is set to become the new US ambassador to London as she stepped out at the premiere of a new documentary about her role as editor of Vogue.

Miss Wintour, who donated tens of thousands of dollars to the Obama election campaign and helped raise another $500,000, is in line to top a shortlist being drawn up by President to replace outgoing ambassador Louis Susman.

The UK-born editor of US Vogue was joined on the red carpet in New York by Sex and the City's Sarah Jessica Parker at whose house she hosted a $40,000-a-plate fundraising dinner.

She is being linked to the job of ambassador in both the UK and France with some speculators suggesting her glittering contacts book would make her the perfect choice and others writing it off as laughable.

A Vogue insider said that Miss Wintour was 'very happy with her current job' and a spokesman for the White House did not deny that it was courting her, but added: 'We have no personnel announcement to make at this time'.

The new documentary, In Vogue: The Editor's Eye, portrays a totally different Wintour to the aloof and arrogant ice maiden lampooned in the film Devil Wears Prada.

Fenton Bailey, the co-director of the latest HBO production described the 62-year-old as being 'accessible, smart and fuzzy.'

As well as hosting fundraising dinners for the Obama campaign, Miss Wintour also brought together leading designers to create accessories emblazoned with the President's image.

Her main competition for the job comes from Matthew Barzun, finance chairman of the President’s re-election campaign.

A Democrat source in Washington said: 'A large number of Obama’s ambassadors have been fundraisers. Both these two fit the bill.

'Anna Wintour is just the kind of figure who could be an effective ambassador.

'You’re
a messenger boy or girl for the President to the host government and to
the business and political worlds, but you’re also supposed to be able 
to throw a party.

'She’s
obviously got fantastic connections in London and that would be an 
advantage. She’s the definition of a glamour pick. I can see it 
happening.'

Ambassadorships to friendly countries 
are commonly given to top-tier fundraisers as a thank you gift after a 
tough campaign, and the post in London is one of the nicest among them. 

An article by Bloomberg cites
two people, described only as being 'familiar with the matter', as 
saying Susman is one of three ambassadors with plum positions who will 
not be continuing abroad.

Dan
Rooney, the owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers who is currently the 
ambassador to Ireland, and Charles Rivkin, the former executive of Jim 
Henson Co. who is the ambassador to France, will also be returning to 
the U.S.

The fact that she is a dual 
citizen of the U.S. and the U.K. also helps Wintour's cause, but 
Bloomberg asserts that she may have competition for the gig.

Matthew Barzun, who served as finance chairman for the re-election campaign, is said to be interested in the job.

Miss Wintour is known for her 
withering put-downs in her fashion empire and has even been given the 
unflattering nickname Nuclear Wintour.

The
daughter of one-time Evening Standard editor Charles Wintour, she was 
born in London but has relinquished her British citizenship.

Wintour has hosted a number of 
fundraisers for the President in the past few months, all of which have 
shown the strength of her Rolodex.

In
May, she co-hosted a $40,000-per-plate dinner for 50 people in actress 
Sarah Jessica Parker's Manhattan townhouse. Prior to the dinner, she 
even appeared in a YouTube video promoting the dinner which offered up 
two raffled tickets to the event.

Wintour was born in London on November 3, 1949, the eldest daughter of Charles Wintour - editor of the London Evening Standard.

As a teen, she worked at boutiques and gained experience at a series of magazines before moving to New York. She became junior fashion editor at Harper's Bazaar in 1975 and she secured a role at Vogue in 1983 as the magazine's first creative director.

After
stints at British Vogue and House & Garden, she eventually took 
over as editor of Vogue in 1988 and changed the direction of the 
magazine, elevating photographers and covering harder news pieces.

Amid
rumours she would be replaced, Wintour said in 2009 that she would not 
retire. That year, she also appeared in a film about the magazine, The 
September Issue.

She is known for her withering 
put-downs in her fashion empire and has even been given the unflattering
nickname Nuclear Wintour.

She
has two children with child psychiatrist David Shaffer, who she married
in 1984 and divorced in 1999. She started dating Shelby Bryan and the 
pair are still together.

In August, she moved her sights out of
the city and partnered up with Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein and 
his fashion designer wife Georgina Chapman to host a $38,500-per-plate 
dinner in their Connecticut home.

She used more than just her contacts to make the money flow in for the President during the long campaign.

Wintour
used her fashion and business savvy to draw up a spreadsheet and prove 
to the President's aides that the creation of a high-end accessories 
line would bring in a sizable amount of cash for the campaign.

From there, she enlisted a host of designer friends to create the goods.

Derek
Lam designed a $75 tote bag, Thakoon Panichgul made a $95 scarf with 
Obama's face pictured, and Richard Blanch was behind the makeup bag that
contained red, white and blue nail polish.

Considering
her prominent position on the donor list and the cycle of turning 
donors into ambassadors, it comes as little surprise that Wintour's name
has been floated as a possibility.

Similarities: Pamela Harriman was made the American ambassador to France in 1993

With her English upbringing, expensive taste and cosy relationships with Democrats, Anna Wintour strikes similarities with a former ambassador for the U.S., Pamela Harriman.

The powerful socialite, who is also known as Winston Churchill's daughter-in-law, was appointed as U.S. Ambassador to France by President Clinton in 1993, when she was 73 years old.

After a charmed childhood in the southwest of England, Harriman studied in Germany and Paris, before working at the Foreign Office in London as a translator. There, she was introduced to Randolph Churchill, the prime minister's son, and he proposed to her in 1939 - on the first night they met.

After having a child, they eventually 
divorced and she moved to Paris. And after meeting 
Broadway producer Leland Hayward in 1959, she moved to New York, and they married in 1960. She 
enjoyed a lavish lifestyle from his successful musicals, including the 
Sound of Music.

After his death in 1971, she married a former flame, Averell Harriman, moved to Washington D.C. and became a U.S. citizen.

She became involved with the Democratic Party and helped create fundraising 
systems, throwing desirable parties - which she oversaw with an exacting eye - attended by the city's most famous faces, much like the events previously thrown by Wintour for Obama.

After her husband died, leaving her with $75 million, Harriman's presence among political soirees grew and she was known to charge as much as $1,000 for a ticket to her parties, with proceeds going to the Democrats.

She was appointed at U.S. Ambassador to France by President 
Clinton in 1993.

In a sign of their close friendship, when she passed away aged 76 in 1997, Clinton dispatched Air Force One to bring her body 
from France to the U.S. and even spoke at her funeral in D.C.
