EU foreign minister Baroness Ashton is facing calls to resign after appearing to use the fatal shootings of three Jewish schoolchildren in France to criticise Israeli policy in Gaza.

In a speech on Palestinian affairs in Brussels, the British EU official suggested that the shootings outside a Jewish school in Toulouse were the same as the deaths of children inadvertently killed in Israeli attacks on Palestinian militants.

Lady Ashton also seemingly compared the deaths in Gaza to the slaughter of innocents in Syria, the rampage by a gunman in Norway last year in which dozens of teenagers were killed and the bus crash in Switzerland that killed 22 Belgian schoolchildren a week ago.

Coffins of the dead lie in shrouds. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a 
statement that he was incensed by Ashton's comments about the tragedy

She said: ‘When we remember young 
people who have been killed in all sorts of terrible circumstances – the
Belgian children having lost their lives in a terrible tragedy and when
we think of what happened in Toulouse, when we remember what happened 
in Norway a year ago, when we know what is happening in Syria, when we 
see what is happening in Gaza and in different parts of the world – we 
remember young people and children who lose their lives.’

The Israeli government demanded that 
Lady Ashton step down, with defence minister Ehud Barak denouncing the 
mention of Gaza as inappropriate and demanding a retraction.

He said: ‘The comparison made by 
Ashton between what is happening in Gaza to what happened in Toulouse, 
and what is going on in Syria every day, is outrageous and has 
absolutely no grounding in reality.’

Israel’s interior minister Eli Yishai 
said Lady Ashton’s statement ‘further harms the ability of the EU to be 
an honest broker’ in the Middle East, adding: ‘She can no longer serve 
in her position.’

He was joined in his calls for a retraction by Avigdor Lieberman, Israel’s foreign affairs minister.

A spokesman for Lady Ashton, who was a
surprise appointment to the new post of EU High Representative for 
Foreign Affairs in 2009, claimed the remarks had been grossly distorted.

‘In her remarks, the High 
Representative referred to tragedies taking the lives of children around
the world and drew no parallel whatsoever between the circumstances of 
the Toulouse attack and the situation in Gaza,’ he said.

But that explanation was not accepted 
by Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said she wrongly 
sought to draw a parallel between the calculated murder of children and 
Palestinian casualties who have died in attacks on adult terrorists in 
Gaza.

‘What especially outrages me is the 
comparison between a targeted massacre of children and the surgical 
defensive actions of the IDF [Israel Defence Forces], intended to strike
at terrorists using children as human shields,’ he said.

Tory MP James Clappison, vice-chairman
of the Conservative Friends of Israel, said: ‘It is entirely 
inappropriate for her to make a comparison between events in France and 
Gaza when she is speaking as the EU’s foreign minister. She needs to 
think again.’

Downing Street launched  a lukewarm defence of  Lady Ashton.

The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: ‘I’m not entirely sure that was the comparison she was making.’

He said Baroness Ashton’s team ‘feel her remarks were taken out of context’.
