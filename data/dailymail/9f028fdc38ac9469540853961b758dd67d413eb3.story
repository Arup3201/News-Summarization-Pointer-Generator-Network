New Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal will make his first appearance at Old Trafford in a pre-season friendly against Valencia on August 12.

Van Gaal's role as Holland coach will end after Saturday's third-place play-off against Brazil at the World Cup and he will then turn his attention to making the Red Devils competitive again after last season's seventh-placed finish - a dismal season which cost David Moyes his job.

Welcome to Old Trafford: Louis van Gaal will meet his new fans at Old Trafford in August

New signings: Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera could make their first Old Trafford debuts against Valencia

The Valencia friendly is also likely to feature new signings Ander Herrera and Luke Shaw playing at their new home for the first time.

Midfielder Darren Fletcher said: 'Obviously they (Herrera and Shaw) will have a taste of it playing on the tour in the US but it will be nothing like playing at Old Trafford. That’s where it is, the bread and butter. That’s where the real fans come and watch.

'They’ll be looking forward to it. It’s a magnificent arena. Where it’s still a friendly it will be good but it won’t be like what it can be, so it will be a gentle introduction for them which will be nice.

'They will soon realise in the league and cup games what Old Trafford can be like. On its day, with the fans behind us, there’s not many better places in the world, and they will experience that.'

Looking 
ahead to the new campaign under Van Gaal, Fletcher said: 'It’s another 
season and an exciting one with a new manager coming in. We really want 
to push on from the disappointments of last season. We’ve got some new 
signings and a real buzz about the place again.

Temporary charge: Ryan Giggs is leading Manchester United's training sessions while Van Gaal is away

'I
 think everyone’s looking forward with great anticipating to the manager
 coming back and getting his ideas across. I know all the players are 
thoroughly excited to get out there and get the team back where they 
belong.'

Manchester
 United will travel to the United States to face LA Galaxy, Roma, Inter 
Milan and Real Madrid before they host La Liga outfit Valencia in their 
last pre-season fixture before their first game of the Premier League 
campaign. 

Red
 Devils assistant manager Ryan Giggs has been placed in temporary charge
 of events at Manchester United's Aon training complex while Van Gaal 
completes his two-year stint at the Dutch national team.

Giggs said: 'The whole of pre-season is important but the nearer you get to the first game in the Premier League the more sharpness you have in your game and you more or less get a feeling if you’ll be involved in that first game.

'It will be Louis’s first game in the dugout at Old Trafford and for Ander (Herrera) and Luke (Shaw) it will be there first game as well, so it will be an introduction for the new players and the new manager.'
