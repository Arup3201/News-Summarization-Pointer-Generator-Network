If you believe Chris Christie is going to put himself at the mercy of a late-night comic, we've got a bridge to sell you.

But it's true. NBC said today that the New Jersey governor is booked to appear on Jimmy Fallon's Tonight show on Thursday, alongside comic Chris Rock and musician Kacey Musgrave.

Christie is no stranger to late-night television. He appeared on Fallon's Late Night three times before the star took over Tonight in February.

But this is his first foray into 
late-night comedy since the story about lane closures on the George 
Washington Bridge became a problem for the Republican governor.

The governor had been accused of making his staff intentionally clog traffic near the George Washington Bridge to punish a political adversary.

Beginning on September 9, 2013, three lanes leading from the town of Fort Lee to the bridge's toll booths were choked into a single-file line, with the other toll lanes serving other bridge traffic.

The resulting backup snarled traffic in the town, delayed school buses and first responders, and led to the death of an elderly woman.

The Republican strongly maintains he never had any knowledge that the bridge closing was orchestrated by staffers in his own office - and certainly never ordered the closing.

Christie was photographed at a 9/11 memorial event in New York City that day and insisted he had no knowledge of any plot regarding the bridge until January.

However, the scandal damaged Christie's brand. He had been considered an early front-runner for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination before Bridgegate.

Now, his name comes up in conversation considerably less.
