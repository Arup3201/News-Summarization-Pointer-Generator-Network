Despite a miserable year on the pitch Manchester United have rocketed into second place on a list of the world's richest football teams with a revenue of £423.8million.

So what will they spend the money on?

Firstly, it is worth noting that United may not fare as well on next year's Deloitte Football Money League thanks to missing out on Champions League football.

Manchester United brought in more revenue for 2013-14 than any other club in the Premier League

Louis van Gaal's side have moved up to second on the list despite not being in the Champions League

The club itself forecasts a drop from £423.8m to between £385m and £395m.

But with the first instalment from their world-record £750m kit deal with adidas due in the summer and their trailblazing commercial operation showing no signs of slowing, experts say they could overtake Real Madrid within two years.

One could be forgiven for imagining that a chunk of the cash could go on wiping out the debt that still remains from the Glazer family's controversial 2005 takeover.

At the last count that stood at £362.2m, which was actually a rise of £1.2m on the same period in the previous year.

A major plan for United is to return to the glory days of the Champions League, like their win in 2008-09

Real Madrid were top of the tree in world football for revenue in the 2013-14 season, with £459.5million 

 

1. Real Madrid - £459.5m

2. Manchester United - £433.2m

3. Bayern Munich - £407.7m

4. Barcelona - £405.2m

5. Paris Saint-Germain - £396.5m

6. Manchester City - £346.5m

7. Chelsea - £324.4m

8. Arsenal - £300.5m

9. Liverpool - £255.8m

10. Juventus - £233.6m

11. Borussia Dortmund - £218.7m

12. AC Milan - £208.8m

13. Tottenham - £180.5m

14. Schalke 04 - £178.9m

15. Atletico Madrid - £142.1m 

16. Napoli £137.8m

17. Inter Milan - £137.1m

18. Galatasaray - £135.4m

19. Newcastle United - £129.7m

20. Everton £120.5m

21. West Ham United - £105.3m

22. Aston Villa - £101.9m

23. Marseille - £100m

24. Roma - £97.7m

25. Southampton - £97.3

26. Benfica - £96.6

27. Sunderland - £95.7m

28. Hamburg - £92.2m

29. Swansea City - £90.5m

30. Stoke City - £90.1m 

That indicates that the US-based bean counters are not looking to pay it off any time soon.

And while Sportsmail understands that United's ownership are at ease with the situation the fact that money spent on servicing the debt is tax deductable is notable.

As for new players, not too much attention should be paid to a relatively quiet (so far) January transfer window.

Manager Louis van Gaal recently said that the lack of activity was due to the traditional problem that very few players who could improve an elite side are available at the turn of the year.

In a call to investors when the club's latest financial figures were released in November, Ed Woodward struck a similar chord.

However, the executive vice-chairman did point to the summer and say the club were already monitoring targets.

With a number of players set to depart it would not be a surprise if the Dutch boss was handed a similar amount to last summer, when £156m was spent on the likes of Angel di Maria, Radamel Falcao and Daley Blind.

Roma midfielder Kevin Strootman, Southampton full back Nathaniel Clyne and Borussia Dortmund defender Mats Hummels are all thought to be on the radar.

United broke the British transfer record to sign Angel di Maria from Real Madrid during the summer

An audacious swoop for Barcelona star Lionel Messi has also been reported, but he is unlikely to leave

An unliklely £200m swoop for Lionel Messi has also been reported but the Argentine is unlikely to leave Barcelona - although a new striker could be on the cards should Falcao continue to frustrate.

Further down the line, qualifying for next season's Champions League is essential with a new TV deal due later this year. United will also benefit from the auctioning of the next Premier League broadcast rights.

Old Trafford officials are also known to be keen on turning the club's remarkable social media following into cash.

If revenues continue to grow as expected, there is a chance that United will look at making Old Trafford bigger

According to United, they attract 380,000 tweets a day and 12m social media posts each month and the club are known to be keen on stepping up its mobile operation.

With regards to matchday revenues, a long-term aim has been to extend the existing South Stand which is dwarfed by the other three structures.

This would be a complex, costly operation given the train line that runs behind it.

However, if revenues continue to grow as expected do not rule out England's largest domestic football stadium getting even bigger.
