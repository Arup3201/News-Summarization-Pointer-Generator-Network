It started with one nose job, ten years ago. Brazilian-born Rodrigo Alves decided to use an inheritance to change the one thing he had always hated about himself.

Fast forward to today and the thirty-year-old flight attendant has spent over £100,000 on 12 operations, including jaw liposuction and six-pack, arm and leg implants.

He claims that he may never end his quest for the perfect face and body, despite almost dying after a recent procedure went horribly wrong.

Rodrigo told This Morning hosts Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield: 'Growing up in Brazil I hated the way I looked. I'm
 a naturally smiley person and my nose would spread all over my face. My
 family would say: "Where did you get that nose from?"

'It started with a nose job. And it 
carried on.I did one nose job and I wasn't happy with it, so went back 
for another one. I'm still not happy with it.'

Rodrigo, who appeared on the show wearing a smart brown suit and piercing hand-painted contact lenses, claims that he doesn't have any celebrity role models that he looks up to or wants to emulate, he said: 'I just want to enhance and better myself, that's what I am striving for.

Three nose jobs = £30,000

Liposuction on jaw = £3,000

Two six-pack operations = £20,000

Fillers in arms = £7,000

Liposuction on legs = £6,000

Calf-shaping operation = £3,000

Botox and fillers = £8,000

Pec implants = £10,000

Laser lipo for weight loss = £7,000

'I tried working out to get the 
results. I went to the best gym in the country, had personal trainers, 
but it never worked for me. So I went for the quick fix.'

Interestingly,
 the South American says that he doesn't want people to copy him: 'It's 
nothing that I'm proud about and I don't encourage anybody else to do it
 either,' but that hasn't stopped him from ruling out any future 
operations, despite the dangers.

In January Rodrigo suffered dangerous complications after undergoing
 a procedure to enhance his biceps, triceps and shoulders with silicone.

The chemical 
leaked into his system and within days his arms has swelled so much that
 he couldn't feed or bathe himself.

Soon he was back in hospital having 
litres of fluid drained from his body. He was perilously close 
to death.

Rodrigo has undergone 20 cosmetic procedures including nose jobs, liposuction, six-pack and pectoral implants, calf shaping, Botox injections and fillers

Rodrigo has vowed to go under the knife again - even though his obsession nearly killed him

Rodrigo's unhappiness with his looks started as a child (left) with a dislike of his nose, prompting an obsession with surgery and 'perfection' that has transformed his appearance (right)

People with BDD may:

At one point doctors told him that one arm might have to be amputated. If the infection caused by the leaking fluid reached his heart he would have died.

After three weeks in hospital with the support of friends and family, Rodrigo recovered and flew back to the UK.

His long list of surgery includes £8,000 on Botox and fillers, £30,000 on three bouts of nose re-shaping surgery, £3,000 on liposuction to his jaw and £10,000 on pectoral implants.

He has also spent £22,000 on a fake six-pack, £7,000 on fillers to his arms, £7,000 on hospital bills, £7,000 on laser liposuction, £6,000 on leg liposuction and £3,000 on calf shaping.

Additionally he indulges in twice-yearly Botox and filler top-ups and takes a cocktail of daily pills consisting of collagen tablets, anti-water retention and hair growth pills. Rodrigo said he 'admires' Barbie’s boyfriend Ken - because the toy looks like the 'ideal man'.

But Rodrigo said that he was still considering a fourth nose job while the doctors and nurses around him attempted to save his life.

He said: 'I was extremely depressed. I would just pray and cry. It was definitely a lesson to me, but I always want more.'

Rodrigo is now being treated for Body Dysmorphia, an anxiety disorder that effects about 1 per cent of the population, he said: 'I am really hoping that that is going to help me. Help me not to keep changing myself.'

But when This Morning host Phillip asked him what will happen when he is 60 or 70 years old, he replied: 'I don't think I'm going to let myself age gracefully.'
