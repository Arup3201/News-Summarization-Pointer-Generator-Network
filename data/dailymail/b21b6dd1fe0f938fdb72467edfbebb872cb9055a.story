April Jones would have been eight next month.

The schoolgirl was murdered by lifeguard Mark Bridger in 2012, who abducted the five-year-old whilst she was out playing on her bike, just minutes from home.

Speaking to Closer magazine this week about how she will mark her dead daughter's birthday, Coral, 43, admitted that she will be baking April's favourite chocolate cake.

Coral, who still carries April's teddy bear everywhere she goes, says: 'I’ll make a chocolate sparkly cake because that was her favourite. We’ll take balloons to her graveside and release lanterns into the sky in our garden in her memory.

'April loved birthdays and would get so excited. On her fifth birthday, we had a children’s entertainer, and she was singing and dancing – we had no idea that would be her last party. 

'April is a hard month for us. I still can’t go out alone and I can’t eat or sleep properly.'

April's violent murder united the country in revulsion and shock in 2012. 

Bridger, it emerged, was obsessed with violent child pornography: he hoarded 400 disgusting images on his computer and watched a horrific rape scene in a film before killing April. 

Bridger’s depravity and evil were matched by his duplicity: he failed to admit to his crime, lying that he had killed April by running her over in his car. He has also steadfastly refused to say what he did with her body. 

What remained of April's body was buried in September 2013 in the family's home town of Machynlleth, Wales

As a result Coral, and April's father Paul have been denied the scant solace of burying their little girl.

‘Mark Bridger is behind bars, but we are trapped in our own prison, too,’ Coral told The Daily Mail in January last year.

‘We’ll carry our pain for the rest of our lives. We’ll never be free from it. I cry every day.' 

It emerged that April Jones's killer Mark Bridger made as many as 100,000 indecent searches online

Coral and Paul, who have two other children, Jazmin, 18, and Harley, 12, have since set up April’s Law – a campaign to stop indecent images of children being allowed on the internet.

The couple have met with Prime Minister David Cameron and say: 'We want a new law to stop people being able to access online child pornography. We also want longer sentences for paedophiles and think they should be on the sex offender's register for life.

'I am really overprotective towards April’s brother and sister now. Jazmin is 19 and has a boyfriend, but I need to know where she is all the time. 

'I miss April every day. She was such a kind-natured girl. She wanted to swim with dolphins, but she’ll never fulfil that dream now.

'I wish April was here to celebrate her birthday. She will never grow up into the beautiful young woman I know she would have been. I hope Bridger rots in his cell.'
