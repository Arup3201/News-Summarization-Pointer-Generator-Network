Colombian Navy found 47-year-old missing fisherman Solano Salazar floating on a portable icebox

The man had set out on with a companion on October 31 and two days later, their boat had capsized

This video from the Colombian Navy shows the exact moment when coast guard sailors, who were running drills in the area, found the man floating in the water.

They managed to rescue the castaway, soon identified as Solano Salazar, and transfer him to hospital.

He is expected to make a full recovery.

The man was sent adrift for 48 hours, before the Coast Guard found him while running routine drills

Thankfully, they were able to rescue the dehydrated man and take him to Malaga Hospital

'The person was rescued and taken to Malaga Hospital,' the commander of Colombia's Pacific Coast Guard, Captain Andres Mejia, said in the video.

'He was given first aide. He was dehydrated and according to what he said, they left (port) on Friday from the Guapi area to fish with another person and they were turned over in bad weather.

'He drifted tied to a portable cooler.'

According to the man, the pair had set out from the Guapi area, but had turned over when they hit bad weather

Found 22 nautical miles from the southwest coast of Colombia, the man is expected to make a full recovery

The 47-year-old fisherman was found 22 nautical miles from the southwest coast of Colombia where he had apparently set out on a fishing venture with the other man.

Salazar said he was doing well now that he is back on dry land.

'I am OK now because the Navy rescued me,' he said.

'I thought I was going to die. I didn't think about anything else.'

His companion is still missing.
