An Instagram hashtag is allowing parents around the world to share their children's weird and wonderful letters to Santa, with this year's requests including everything from 'two packs of gum' to 'a princess castle'. 

The festive tag #lettertosanta also showcases a number of notes from kindhearted youngsters whose only wish this holiday season is for those less fortunate than them to receive something nice from Santa. 

'Finally I have been waiting for Christmas to come all year,' one young girl called Maddy wrote in her letter. 'I hope that the poor people will be safe.'

One young boy called Christian, who clearly has incredibly expensive taste, lists a variety of ornate jewels and precious gems on his list, before asking Santa Claus to help make his sister feel better. 

'This is what [I want for] Christmas,' he writes. 'Crystals and diamonds and a gold ring with red rubies and a big blue crystal and a big bit of gold and blue rubies. 

'And I hope my sister gets better. 

'And an electric guitar and a saxophone. Love from Christian.' 

In an adorable letter to Father Christmas, one youngster asks that he find a friend for his stuffed animal Terry.

'What I would like most for Christmas is a friend for my stuffed animal called Terry who's a penguin,' the letter explains. 'Because Terry feels a bit lonely. He would like a friend who looked similar to him.'

Others are much more specific about what they would like to find under the Christmas tree this year, with one young girl requesting nothing other than 'new bows' in her letter. 

'Dear Saint Nick, hello!' she writes. 'I hope you have the most excellent Christmas. This year, I need some more bows. 

'First of all, some of my bows don't even match my clothes. That is a big deal to me. 

'I had bows since I was a baby. I believe I need some more bows.' 

Another eager letter writer has made Santa's job even easier this year, listing just one simple item on his Christmas list: a magazine. 

Other children are happy to give old Saint Nick the chance to be a bit creative with his gift giving, asking him to choose something that he thinks they might like. 

'St Nicholas (Santa),' young Bianca writes. 'I want to wish you a Merry Christmas... May I have two packs of gum and other sorts of stuff.'

She signs off at the end of the letter: 'Love you silly boy.' 

Strict instructions: Some of the letters featured incredibly detailed suggestions about how Santa might best go about delivering the gifts

'I have been very good': Many of the children are sure to explain to Santa that their behavior throughout the year has been well above average

Then there are the children whose letter come with very strict instructions about how Santa should deliver their gifts - and there are even those who include warnings about what will happen to him should he fail to get them what they ask for.

One child explains: 'Dear Santa Claus, I have a stocking. It is new. If you bring a lot of stuff, use the big stocking. If you bring not so much, use the little one.'

Unsurprisingly, merchandise from Disney's hit animated movie Frozen was high on a lot of children's lists, with Princess Elsa dolls, Anna costumes and Olaf teddies all included in this year's letters to the North Pole.

Rather surprisingly, a number of the letters featured don't include any requests at all - but rather include lovely stories and anecdotes which the authors wanted to share with Santa in order to brighten up his holiday - or in some cases to explain away any bad behavior which might land them on the naughty list.

'He is very fun. Thank you for letting me have him. 

'Every morning I have fun looking for him. He is a sneaky elf and I like that... 

'He is not too hard to find and not to easy, he is just right.'

Another child adds: 'Dear Santa Claus, how are your reindeer? How are you feeling? I have been very good this year. Sometimes Taj and I fight but we love each other!'
