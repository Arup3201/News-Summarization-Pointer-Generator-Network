A video warning Poles of the dangers of coming to Britain has been issued with the backing of the Government.

Migrants who are unprepared could be ripped off, made homeless and even set on fire by thugs, it says.

The three-minute film funded by Whitehall warns of the consequences of illegal working, sleeping rough and street violence.

Warning: The stark video advises people in Poland that without a job and home in Britain they risk being attacked by thugs

Homeless: It tells the story of Jacek who ends up sleeping rough after losing his cash in hand job

Fire: In the most dramatic moment flames appear to engulf him in his sleeping bag

It advises Poles to ‘be well prepared’ if they are coming to Britain – with a guaranteed job and back-up money.

But it also shows dramatic and 
alarming images of a Polish immigrant, played by  an actor, who loses 
his job and is then beaten up and burned while he is sleeping on the 
street.

The advice – not to assume the streets
 of London or other British cities are paved with gold – comes at a time
 of increasing concern about the plight of unemployed eastern European 
migrants.

Official counts say that around four 
in ten of the rough sleepers in London come from eastern Europe and more
 than a fifth are Poles.

Romanian migrants are also living in desperate 
poverty in Britain. Westminster Council is anxious to stop begging by 
organised Romanian groups in the  capital and this week there have been
 concerns over the appearance of an eastern European shantytown in 
Hendon, North London.

Whitehall has already backed efforts 
to warn Romanians and Bulgarians over the potential difficulties of life
 in Britain to try to prevent the arrival of unprepared migrants when 
the labour market is opened to citizens of the two countries at the end 
of the year.

Immigrant: The video talks about how Jacek moved to England in search of work and a better life, but was not well-prepared

Streets: Up to one in 10 rough sleepers in London are Polish, according to latest figures

The Department for Communities and 
Local Government and the Foreign Office have both backed the 
three-minute Polish language video, as has the Polish embassy in London.

Narrated by an actor playing a successful Polish immigrant, it tells 
Poles that his success was achieved only by hard work and that many 
pitfalls await those who move to Britain.

Before You Go tells the story of what 
can happen if foreigners do not have a job or accommodation when they 
arrive from overseas.

Advice: Another character in the three-minute film, Andzrej, boasts of being well prepared when he moved to Britain

London: The video is entitled Before You Go - Zanim wyjedziesz in Polish

Mick Clarke, of charity The Passage, 
which made the film, said: ‘In recent years we have seen firsthand the 
devastating impact of people failing to prepare before they travel to 
the UK … Before You Go enables us to get a clear prevention message out 
there before people travel, to help ensure that for those who do come to
 the UK their move is a success.’

Housing Minister Mark Prisk said: 
‘Sadly too many rough sleepers are foreign nationals who arrived in the 
UK without realistic prospects and as a result ended up with a life on 
the streets.’

He said the film aimed to ensure migrants ‘understand the risks’.
