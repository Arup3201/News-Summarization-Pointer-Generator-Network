Ministers have been accused of sacrificing centuries of English shipbuilding to placate Scottish voters before next year’s independence referendum.

The Ministry of Defence announced yesterday that warship construction will end at Portsmouth – home of the Royal Navy since the days of the Mary Rose and Sir Francis Drake – in order to save shipyards on the Clyde.

Defence giant BAE Systems announced that it was cutting 1,775 jobs. Some 940 shipyard workers – along with 170 agency workers – will be laid off in Portsmouth, where ships will undergo maintenance.

Job losses: Another 835 jobs will be lost at yards in Govan (pictured) and Scotstoun on the Clyde in Glasgow, at Rosyth in Fife and at the firm¿s Filton office near Bristol

Another 835 jobs will be lost at yards in Govan and Scotstoun on the Clyde in Glasgow, at Rosyth in Fife and at the firm’s Filton office near Bristol.

However, the Clyde yards won a contract for three offshore patrol vessels to keep them active until the building of a new generation of Type-26 frigates.

David Cameron’s official spokesman claimed the Portsmouth dockyard was losing out ‘in the UK national interest’ and repeatedly failed to deny that the decision to prop up the Scottish yards was influenced by the referendum.

In a clear signal that Scottish political considerations were part of the equation, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond made it clear that the frigates contract would be stripped from Scotland if voters chose to leave the United Kingdom.

‘The UK has not – except during the two world wars – ever placed orders for complex warships outside the UK, and I don’t anticipate that the UK would wish to do that in the future,’ he said. ‘I think there’s something there that people in Scotland need to think about very carefully.’

But critics warned that the closure of Portsmouth would rob England of its expertise to build the new frigates if there was a Yes vote in Scotland.

Caroline Dinenage, Tory MP for Gosport, said: ‘Scottish jobs have been protected at the expense of those on the South coast.’

BAE Systems and the MoD said the cuts were necessary because shipbuilding work was declining as the construction of two aircraft carriers neared completion. David Cameron was consulted, but the issue was not discussed in full at the National Security Council, where strategic decisions are supposed to be taken.

Speaking out: The decision on where the Type 26 frigates will be built will not be made until the end of next year, after the Scottish referendum in September, but Mike Hancock, the Lib Dem MP for Portsmouth South, pictured, said that could be too late

To plug the gap between the completion of the aircraft carriers in 2015, the MoD said it would commission three offshore patrol vessels to play ‘a key role in counter-terrorism, counter-piracy and anti-smuggling operations’.

Work on the vessels is due to begin next year in Scotland, with the first ship being delivered to the Royal Navy in 2017.

Shortly after 10am yesterday, workers in Portsmouth were told to attend a meeting with BAE bosses who told them they could apply for voluntary redundancy, retrain or be redeployed to Govan.

Painter Jim Wheatcroft, 33, the father of four daughters under 10, has worked at the yard for 17 years. ‘It’s definitely a political decision,’ he said. ‘It’s disgusting. They don’t care about us.’

Shipbuilder James Jackson, 45, from Birkenhead, Merseyside, said: ‘The mood in the room was sour and bitter. They have kept us in the dark for so long and now, just before Christmas, they’ve told us we are going to lose out jobs.’

The decision on where the Type 26 frigates will be built will not be made until the end of next year, after the Scottish referendum in September, but Mike Hancock, the Lib Dem MP for Portsmouth South, said that could be too late.

‘Five hundred years of tradition is going to be swept away,’ he said. ‘If the referendum went against the UK government then it would be very hard to replace what we’ve taken apart in Portsmouth. It’s a very foolish government that puts all its eggs into one basket.’

For more than 800 years, Portsmouth’s proud shipbuilding tradition has played a key role in Britain being a major naval power.

In 1194, Richard I – Richard the Lionheart –  built the first dock. Under Henry VII, it grew as a naval base and the world’s first dry dock was constructed there in 1495.

His son, Henry VIII – regarded as the founder of the modern navy – added at least 85 ships to the fleet and made Portsmouth its main base.

Work on his flagship the Mary Rose began in 1509 and she was later refitted to become the first British warship to have a complete lower deck of guns with hinged ports.

In the 18th century, the dockyard, with its engineering and armament yards, was the largest industrial complex in the world.

The first iron-hulled warship, HMS Warrior, was built in 1860, ushering in a new wave of shipbuilding.

The revolutionary HMS Dreadnought, launched in 1905 by King Edward VII, gave its name to a new type of battleship.

During the First World War, 1,658 ships were docked for refit or repair in Portsmouth as personnel numbers rose to 23,000 and for the first time women were employed at the yard.

After the war, construction continued but was limited to cruisers and smaller ships. By 1937, numbers had declined to 15,000.

Some 2,550 ships were docked at Portsmouth during the Second World War, but the yard suffered major bomb damage and the Royal Navy’s larger ships were moved to ports further north. Numbers employed rose to a record 27,000.

After the war, Portsmouth built only destroyers and frigates. The 2,860-ton frigate HMS Andromeda, completed in 1967, was the last of nearly 300 ships entirely built at the dockyard.

The renaissance of shipbuilding came in 2006 with the launch of the £80million, 1,300-ton offshore patrol vessel, HMS Clyde.

The dockyards were bought by BAE Systems in 2009 and projects included building a 7,000-ton midship section, 5,000-ton stern section and control towers for aircraft carriers HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales.

The Portsmouth Historic Dockyard attraction is home to HMS Victory, in which Nelson set sail from the city before the battle of Trafalgar in 1805, HMS Warrior and the Mary Rose.

She sank in the Solent in 1545 as she led an attack on the French fleet. The wreck was salvaged in 1982 and finally went on display last May.

Labour defence spokesman Vernon Coaker said: ‘Britain must retain a sovereign ship-building capability. None of us want to see Scotland leave the United Kingdom, but we need clarity from the Government about what safeguards are in place to meet all eventualities after next year’s referendum.’

Gerald Vernon-Jackson, leader of Portsmouth Council, said: ‘I condemn the decision to shut down the last remaining shipyard in England with the capability to build advanced surface warships.

‘This decision is bad for Portsmouth, with the loss of many highly skilled jobs, but it’s also bad for the defence of the UK and for the Royal Navy.’

Scots have developed a ‘sense of victimhood’ after the collapse of their heavy industries, one of the country’s most senior judges said yesterday.

In a lecture at Lincoln’s Inn, Supreme Court judge Lord Sumption said the push for independence was a result of the failure of Scotland’s steel, shipbuilding and heavy engineering industries and the state takeover of its economy.
