A woman was saved from being thrown into the Grand Union Canal in Milton Keynes after police fired a Taser at her abductor

The ordeal began when Thames Valley Police received a 999 call from a house in Great Linford, near Milton Keynes, and could hear loud shouting in the background.

The call was received a few minutes after midnight yesterday. A police spokesman said the woman, believed to have previously been in a relationship with the man, was being held against her will.

‘Officers tried to negotiate her release but the man was not co-operating and eventually the situation was deemed so serious, it was decided the Taser should be deployed,’ he said.

‘A 32-year-old man from Milton Keynes was subsequently arrested on suspicion of kidnap. He is currently in police custody.’

The victim was not injured during the incident.

Chief Superintendent Gilbert Houalla said: ‘A Taser is only considered for use in cases where it is necessary and proportionate to the behaviour the officer encounters.’
