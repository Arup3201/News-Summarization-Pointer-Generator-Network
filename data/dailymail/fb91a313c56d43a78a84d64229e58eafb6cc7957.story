A recovering meth addict resisted the temptation to run off with a small fortune when he returned a bag filled with $125,000 he saw fall from a Brinks armored truck.

Joe Cornell, of Fresno, has been living at a Salvation Army rehab center and trying to get clean.

He was the only one who saw the bag fall on Wednesday, and could easily have made off with the cash.

Joe Cornell was living at the Salvation Army and finishing rehab for meth addiction when he saw a bag filled with $125,000 fall off a Brinks truck

Instead he returned the money to Brinks.

Cornell told reporters the act of integrity was spurred after thinking about all the people missing cash could affect.

'Deposits from businesses and stuff, so that could have trickled down
 to a lot of peopleâ€™s jobs, who knows what,' he told KTLA. 'So I just 
figured it was the right thing to do.'

Joe's wife Virginia hopes his honesty will help him find a job when he finishes rehab next month

Brinks was so impressed with Cornell's honesty they gave he and his wife Virginia a $5,000 debit card as a reward.

Cornell will be out of rehab in July.

Hopefully, his reputation for doing the right thing will help land him a job.
