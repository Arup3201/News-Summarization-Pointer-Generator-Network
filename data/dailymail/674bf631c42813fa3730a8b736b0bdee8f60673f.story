The grief-stricken owners of Jagger the Irish setter  have shared heartbreaking photographs of the dog with their nine-year-old son, in whose arms he died after being 'murdered at Crufts'. 

Aleksandra Lauwers will join her husband and 'devastated' son, Jeremy, tomorrow in scattering the ashes of her second ‘beautiful child.’ 

Just five days ago the family were celebrating after he was a medal winner at Crufts, the world’s most prestigious dog show.

But a little over 24 hours later their life was ripped apart when without warning he fell into a coma and died in their arms.

Now the family has released a collection of photographs of Jagger and his 'best friend', nine-year-old Jeremy as they vow to find the culprit of the dog's death.

Devastated: Jeremy, now nine, runs Jagger round a competition field. The Irish setter died in suspicious circumstances last week, his owners convinced he was the victim of meat poisoning 

Mrs Lauwers shook with emotion yesterday as she told the Mail ‘To the person who has done this I would say: I hope you can sleep well knowing you have killed my beautiful child.

‘He was our love, our family member and the very best friend to our son.

‘We are still in a state of shock.

‘My son is devastated. He does not know how somebody could be so cruel and do this to an innocent and helpless animal.

‘Why would anyone want to cause Jagger such a slow and painful death?

She realised something was very wrong when Jagger’s jaw dropped and he started to tremble after they returned from Crufts to their large detached family home in the quiet village of Lauw in east Belgium on Friday evening.

She said: ‘I thought he was having a heart attack but he fell into a coma.

‘The vet arrived very quickly, but it was too late. Within fifteen minutes Jagger was dead.’

Jagger was born in Britain on 1 May 2011, the son of prize winning dog Mr Jingles who retired earlier this year.

His pedigree name was Thendara Satisfaction, after the kennels run by his co-owner Dee Milligan-Bott.

The Lauwers bought him as a 10-month old puppy for around £850. By then he was affectionately known to all as Jagger.

At the time the Lauwers posted a picture of him on their website with the caption: ‘We are all looking forward to a great fun in the future with this stunning boy.’

Mrs Lauwers said: ‘He lived with us but knew he had a mum and dad in England too. He was a loyal and dedicated pet.’

From the start he won them over with his sense of adventure, and was particularly close to the couple’s now nine-year-old son, Jeremy.

Other pictures show Mrs Lauwers and her son cuddling Jagger and the puppy larking about with decorations at his first family Christmas.

Jagger followed in his father’s footsteps and was soon picking up awards and commendations at dog shows.

At just over a year old he was crowned Luxembourg Junior Champion and a few months later finished second in the Junior Day Belgium competition.

The following year he finished second in a category at the East of England Championship Show, prompting the Lauwers to post: ‘our boy did us proud.’

The three-year-old Irish setter was 'best friend' to the couple's son, Jeremy. The family have vowed to find the person responsible for his 'slow and painful' death

The Lauwers said when he travelled to Crufts he was in terrific form and there was no indication of any problems, and certainly no suggestion that anyone meant to harm him.

Gillian Barker Bell, a judge at the show, said when she saw him for the mid-limit class at 2.30pm on Thursday he looked ‘absolutely fine’ and that his subsequent death was ‘incomprehensible.’

Mrs Lauwers said they would not let Jagger's death stop them from competing again in the future 

She added: ‘He did not look ill. The rules say if you think a dog seems ill you excuse him the ring.’

Mrs Lauwers said the only time he was alone during the competition was when he was on the bench awaiting to perform.

‘That is the only time it could have happened. It was the only time he was unsupervised.

‘That is also the time people come and see the dogs, which is something we fully support.’

After Jagger’s death a vet found cubes of meat laced with a slow-acting toxin in his stomach and the family contacted local police.

Toxology tests will be completed by the end of the week which should determine the cause of death, amid suggestions they could be rat poison or slug repellants.

Before then Jagger will be cremated.

Mrs Lauwers said: ‘We will hold a little memorial service with my husband and son to say goodbye.

‘We will then scatter his ashes over the fields and woods by our house where he used to love going for a walk.

‘I will be back at Crufts in the future.

‘I think he was just the wrong dog at the wrong place at the wrong time.

‘I won't let the pitiful actions of one mindless idiot put me off doing what I love.

‘I will return in future and I will compete in his honour.

‘I will win in Jagger's memory. ‘

Mrs Lauwers and her husband William (above outside their home) said they believe their dog was in 'the wrong place at the wrong time'
