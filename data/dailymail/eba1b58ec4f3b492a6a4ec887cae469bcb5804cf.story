A dog in New York has become an internet sensation after modelling the very latest in menswear fashion.

Photographed wearing an array of stylish outfits from 'geek chic' to 'vintage grunge', the handsome hound has become a style guru for fashionistas the world over.

Known as the Menswear Dog, four-year-old, Bodhi, now has over 140,000 followers on picture sharing social media site Instagram and has even landed paid modelling contracts with brands such as Salvatore Ferragamo, Coach, Todd Snyder, ASOS and many more.

The brainchild of New York based owners, Yena Kim, 27, and Dave Fung, 29, the pair began dressing their adorable Shiba Inu dog simply as a way of passing a few hours on a Saturday afternoon.

After posting pictures on their Facebook page, the pair were overwhelmed with the positive response and soon decided to start their own Tumblr page, featuring the pooch posing in the most up-to-date trends.

But it wasn't long before the fashion conscious canine appeared on the website of men's style guide, GQ Magazine, gaining a small army of followers in the process.

With Yena's background as a fashion designer for Ralph Lauren and Dave's extensive experience as a graphic designer, its no surprise that Bodhi has been propelled into the style stratosphere and now uses his new found fame to help raise funds for various animal welfare charities across the US.

However, it seems the Menswear Dog is destined for bigger and better things and even has plans bring out his own clothing range, donating a percentage of each outfit to sponsor a rescue animal for a month.

Yena said 'We didn't have any epic plans when we started our blog, we were bored one Saturday afternoon so we decided to pass the time by dressing up our handsome Shiba in serious menswear.

'We snapped a few photos and posted to our personal Facebook and the response was unreal, so the next day was spent putting together a Tumblr, the following day, our Tumblr was featured on GQ's website and it just snowballed from there.

'We receive countless emails for collaborations with fashion labels and he has worked with some really great brands already, such as Salvatore Ferragamo, Coach, Todd Snyder, ASOS among many more.

'He likes to wear clothes that will get him the most attention and peanut butter, he knows he can pull off anything so he's not all that concerned.

'We receive most of the clothes from the brands that we are working with but we're constantly shopping around for the most exciting items in menswear to show on Menswear Dog, since we're both designers, we design and create the clothes that he wears to appearances.

'Bodhi essentially does whatever he wants, we wouldn't say he's a well-trained dog, but he is phenomenal at what he does.

'The first time we dressed him up in menswear, we saw a spark in his eye and he sat still and gazed at the camera, no directions needed.

'We are currently working on a clothing line for dogs and we hope to continue to collaborate on projects that benefit animal charities.

'Dave has been a professional Graphic Designer for close to a decade and I have a background in Fashion Design, working at Ralph Lauren until Menswear Dog hit the scene, we both decided to quit our jobs so we could have an adventure as a family and live a life less ordinary.

'We've been so blessed with Bodhi and we know that every animal has something special and unique about them, so we're never been more motivated.'
