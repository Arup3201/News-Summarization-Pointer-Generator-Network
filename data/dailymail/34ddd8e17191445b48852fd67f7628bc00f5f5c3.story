Geraint Thomas has signed a new two-year deal with Team Sky that will run until the end of 2016.

The versatile Welshman has become an important part of the team since joining in 2010 and produced some brilliant rides in this year's Tour de France as he eventually placed 22nd.

His result was his highest finish in a Grand Tour, while last year he helped Chris Froome clinch Team Sky's second yellow jersey in two years in France.

Thomas, one of eight British riders at the team, said: 'I'm really happy to be staying with Team Sky for another two years. I've been here since the start and I firmly believe it is the best place for me to fulfil my potential as a bike rider.

'I feel very supported here and I'm excited about what the future holds. I'll look forward to challenging myself both on and off the bike and striving to become the very best at what I do.'

Thomas, a two-time Olympic gold medalist in the team pursuit, has committed himself to the road in the last couple of years and Team Sky boss Sir Dave Brailsford is delighted the 28-year-old has decided to extend his stay.

Brailsford said: 'We're delighted that Geraint has re-signed for another two years. He's been with Team Sky from the start and has been essential to the success that we've had.

'Team Sky has always been built around a strong British core, developing and nurturing home-grown talent to be the best they can be - and Geraint has been at the heart of that.

'On and off the bike Geraint is an influential member of Team Sky. Not only is he a strong character but he's one of a handful of world-class riders that can do it all, whether that's on the climbs, flat, cobbles or time trials, which proves what a valuable member of the team he is.

'Over the last three weeks of the Tour de France Geraint has again underlined his qualities and has shown that he's an exceptional rider with an exciting future.

'He's a great guy, a good leader and we're delighted that he'll be a key part of the team going forward.'
