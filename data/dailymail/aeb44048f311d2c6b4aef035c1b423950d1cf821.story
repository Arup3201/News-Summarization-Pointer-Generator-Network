Militia loyal to Syrian president Bashar al-Assad were accused of the massacre of more than 200 civilians yesterday after helicopter gunships and tanks attacked a village.

The mass killing – the bloodiest since the beginning of the Syrian crisis 17 months ago – was described by Foreign Secretary William Hague as ‘shocking and appalling’.

United Nations envoy Kofi Annan also condemned the ‘appalling’ attack.

Massacre: More than 250 Syrians were killed yesterday when the village of Tremseh was shelled and stormed by what are thought to have been pro-government forces

UN monitors demanded immediate access 
to the village of Tremseh, in the war-torn Hama province, to investigate
what had taken place.

The Syrian government denied any 
involvement, instead blaming ‘terrorists’. But survivors insisted the 
military had attacked from the air and with artillery before 
pro-government militia carried out waves of executions.

Women, children and the elderly were said to be among the victims.

Damage: Black smoke rises from buildings near a mosque in Homs

Horrific: The massacre in the Sunni Muslim village Tremseh, Hama province, would be the worst yet since a rebellion against the rule of President Bashar al-Assad began 17 months ago

But the Syrian state news agency said 
the bloodshed was caused by dozens of members of ‘armed terrorist 
groups’ who had raided the village and were randomly firing on 
residents.

Security forces clashed with the armed men, killing and capturing many of them, the report said.

It said three soldiers and some  50 
residents were killed. The massacre took place on Thursday, as the UN 
Security Council began negotiating a potentially crucial new resolution 
on Syria.

The mandate for the UN’s observer 
mission expires next Friday and council members are locked in debate 
about a resolution, which must be passed if the mission is to be 
renewed.

Tremseh was attacked on Thursday. One 
video posted online showed the dead bodies of 15 men lined up on a 
floor. Some were covered in blood and had head and chest wounds. Another
showed a young man wailing over the body of an elderly man wrapped in a
blanket in the street. Mr Annan said: ‘I condemn these atrocities in 
the strongest possible terms. It is desperately urgent that this 
violence and brutality stops and more important than ever that 
governments with influence exert it more effectively to ensure that the 
violence ends – immediately.’

Mr Hague said he would press the UN 
for firmer action and insisted the incident should increase the pressure
for a united response from the international community, including 
Russia and China.

‘Everything we have seen of the Syrian
regime’s behaviour over the last 17 months suggests that these reports 
are credible,’ he said. ‘They demand a united response from the 
international community. The time has come for decisive diplomatic 
action to bring about a peaceful end to the violence.’

Activists say more than 17,000 people have so far been killed in the uprising against Assad’s regime, most of them civilians.

The Syrian government says more than 4,000 members of the security forces have been killed.
