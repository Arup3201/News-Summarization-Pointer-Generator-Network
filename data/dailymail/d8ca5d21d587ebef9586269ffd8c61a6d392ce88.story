Tragic: Police have confirmed that they have found a body in the search for missing mother-of-three Karen Simpson who went missing on Sunday

Police searching for a missing mother-of-three who vanished while suffering post-natal depression have found a body.

Karen Simpson, 31, disappeared from her home in the village of Burscough, near Ormskirk, Lancashire, on Sunday morning when she went to a local Tesco store leaving her three-month-old girl with relatives and never returned.

She had told family members that she needed to 'clear her head.'

More than 170 people had been involved in a search of the area including 70 police officers plus mountain rescue teams, police divers, the force helicopter and volunteers.

But Lancashire Police have confirmed that they found a body, believed to be that of Mrs Simpson, in a field in her home village this morning.

A police spokesman said: 'Karen’s family have been informed and are being supported by specially trained officers.'

The force said the death was not being treated as suspicious at this stage.

A post-mortem examination will be carried out to establish how she died.

Mrs Simpson was married to husband Philip and had two young sons as well as her three-month-old daughter.

She was seen leaving the Tesco store in the village at about 11am but did not return to her nearby home as expected.

In a statement today, Lancashire Police said: 'Very sadly, at around 10.30am this morning, the body of a woman was found in a field off Marsh Moss Lane in Burscough.

'The body is believed to be that of missing 31-year-old Karen Simpson who had not been seen since the weekend.

'A post-mortem examination will be carried out to establish the cause of death but at this stage there are not thought to be any suspicious circumstances.

Desperate hunt: Those involved in the search for Mrs Simpson had put up posters appealing for information as to her whereabouts

Grim discovery: Police found a body at around 10.30am this morning in a field close to where Mrs Simpson was last seen

'We would like to thank all the community for their overwhelming support and assistance during the searches for Karen.'

Yesterday, her sister, Clair Dobrec, said Mrs Simpson had been receiving support for post-natal depression as the family made an emotional appeal for the young mother to return home.

She had said: 'This is one of the reasons we are so concerned for her.

'I want to say to directly to Karen: if you see or hear this appeal, we know you haven’t been feeling well and we want you to know that we are all here to support you.'

Karen's other sister Paula Caunce had added: ‘The hardest thing at the moment is not knowing what has happened.

Treatment: Mrs Simpson, who also had two young sons and was married, suffered from post-natal depression following the birth of her daughter last year for which she had been receiving treatment

‘I
was with her the day before. She was a bit quiet but otherwise OK. She 
was supposed to come to mine the next day but never got the chance. We 
all just want her home safe.’

A Facebook page set up appealing for 
Mrs Simpson to come home had attracted more than 7,000 followers as hundreds 
of volunteers rallied together to search footpaths, fields and gardens 
around the area where she was last seen.

Karrin
Burrows, one of Mrs Simpson's close friends who had known her since 
high school, had described her as an 'amazing person'.

She added: 'Karen is the life and soul of 
anything, she lights up a room.

Worry: Sister Paula Caunce (pictured left with Mrs Simpson) said the hardest part had been not knowing what had happened to her sister

Appeal: Mrs Simpson's other sister Claire Dobrec, who flew from Western Australia to help with the search, (pictured with brother-in-law Andrew Simpson) said Mrs Simpson was receiving help for post-natal depression

‘She is always there for everybody and loves her children. They are her whole world.

‘There is not a bad bone in her body. She's friends with everybody and you can see that by the turnout for the search today.'

Friends of Mrs Simpson paid tribute to her today on the Facebook group set up in a bid to try and find her.

A message posted this afternoon said: 'Sadly heaven has got a new angel today, 
thankyou to everyone who has helped with searches, food leaflets etc.

'All we ask is for you now to give the family some privacy. RIP our dear 
Karen, sleep well angel xx'

Carolyn Harvey posted: 'Such sad news. RIP Karen.

'I didn't know you well but on the few occasions I did meet you you were always so lovely.

'My thoughts are with the family at this incredibly sad time xxx'

Jackie White added: 'She will be the most beautiful Angel ever.

'Sweet dreams Karen you were a wonderful person and will be sadly missed x x x'
