Despite never once having had a conversation with their eldest daughter about sex education, Mr and Mrs Gallop - 81 and 78, respectively - took Cindy's news remarkably well. 'In good spirit', even.

'They have gotten used to me over the years,' said New York-based Cindy Gallop, 52. 'They know I am doing good.'

Gallop, you see, is the Oxford-educated brains behind MakeLoveNotPorn.tv, a website featuring homemade, for-rent videos of real-life couples having sex.

Gallop was brought up in Borneo by her strict Chinese mother and British, school-inspector father, educated at boarding school in England, and lost her virginity aged 21.

Speaking to the Sunday Times Magazine, she said the aim of her online start-up is to provide an alternative to the industrial-strength hardcore porn on the market.

The videos on her site, she feels, look less like hardcore porn and more like sexy indie films.

Admitting that she likes porn and watches it herself, she also says that children today are watching incredibly graphic reenactments of sex, often before they have even had their first sexual experience, and wouldn't it just be better for them to see something more realistic?

The average age for children to start watching porn is, she says, around 11 years old. Some even begin as early as eight. Teachers have already told her they are planning on incorporating MakeLoveNotPorn.com into their sex education lessons.

Cindy Gallop describes her new venture as 'of the people, by the people and for the people who believe that the sex we have everyday is the hottest sex there is'

Describing herself as a 'rampant 
feminist', Gallop worries that men, women and children are being give an
unrealistic, anti-feminist, violent and misogynistic vision of what sex
is - something that can only give them an extremely damaging 
relationship with both sex and their future sexual partners.

Gallop, who has worked in advertising
for most of her working life and was president of British company BBH (Bartle Bogle Hegarty), describes her new venture as 'of the 
people, by the people and for the people who believe that the sex we 
have everyday is the hottest sex there is'.

The subtitle for her site - which so 
far features 18 videos, each of which cost $5 (£3) to rent - is 'Porn 
World Vs. Real World', and she wholeheartedly believes 'we can change the world through sex and porn'

MakeLoveNotPorn.com, the website explaining Gallop's mission, receives 3,000 unique visitors a day

To sign up to MakeLoveNotPorn.tv you must enter your address on the webpage and wait for an invitation

Just six weeks since its launch, the site already has 76,000 members - even though membership is still invitation only.

MakeLoveNotPorn.com, the sister site which provides her mission statement, receives 3,000 new visitors every day.

As for the rental fee paid on each video, half goes back into her business - which received private investment of $500,000 (over £300,000) from a donor who wishes to remain anonymous in May 2011 - and half goes to the real-life stars of the films.

Her campaign for 'real-world sex' was initially launched through a speech she gave at a Technology, Entertainment and Design (TED) conference in 2009 in front of speakers including Bill Gates and Sir Tim Berners-Lee who invented the internet.
