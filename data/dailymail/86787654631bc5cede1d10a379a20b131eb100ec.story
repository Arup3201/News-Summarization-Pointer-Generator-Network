Britons will have to be mindful of protecting their skin in the coming days of surprisingly strong sunshine to avoid sunburn (pictured)

A lobster-red sunburn is not a good look on anyone and can result in painful blistering and long-term skin damage.

Now Britons will have to be more careful than ever of protecting their skin in the coming days of surprisingly strong sunshine.

This is because a recently formed ozone hole over the UK is allowing high levels of potentially harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays to travel through the atmosphere, increasing the risk of fair skin being burned.

The ozone layer in the Earth’s stratosphere usually prevents most of the UV rays reaching people far below.

Every year ozone levels over Antarctica and sometimes the Arctic, plummet because of the use of CFCs by humans and ozone from other areas fill the gap.

Consequently, UV levels in Britain have soared in recent days with the formation of a new ozone hole.

As skin has been swathed in warm clothes over winter, it has not had time to acclimatise to UV by making a brown pigment called melanin, which protects the DNA in skin cells against damage from UV rays by absorbing the incoming radiation.

People particularly susceptible to sunburn also have to be careful at this time of year, as although temperature may not be as high as summer, the light is still powerful as the sun is higher in the sky.

John O’Hagen of Public Health England told The Times: ‘There’s more sunburn at Easter than the middle of June’.

‘It’s not necessarily hot, but the levels of ultraviolet in sunshine are rising and if there’s an ozone hole it exacerbates the problem.’

The ozone hole is an annual thinning of the ozone layer over Antarctica, caused by stratospheric chlorine. Smaller areas of thinning are known as ozone holes.

Every year ozone layers over Antarctica fall drastically during the Southern Hemisphere's spring and the Arctic can be affected too.

Experts think this started happening in the 1970s as a result of the use of CFCs, which were popularly found in aerosols, How Stuff Works explained.

The hole forms in the Antarctic because cold air is trapped by strong circulating winds and leads to the formation of ice clouds, which break down chlorine-containing compounds, because of our use of CFCs. This makes the area especially susceptible to ozone depletion.

To plug the gap, ozone from other areas returns over the affected poles every year. But small holes still occur elsewhere.

Experts advise wearing a summer hat – even though it is Springtime – especially between 11am and 3pm when the sunshine is at its strongest.

They think that people are caught unawares by the danger of being burned as they sit outside for longer and do not get so hot at this time of year.

While there are warnings that an ozone hole will be over Britain over the Easter Bank Holiday, cloudy weather is forecast, which will act as a filter to stop the worst of the UV rays getting through. The weather is expected to be cloudy and rainy next week.

While it is important to protect skin against the harmful effects of sunburn, including premature ageing and an increased risk of skin cancer, experts have also stressed the health benefits of being outside so that our bodies get enough Vitamin D.

Being outside in the sunshine has also been linked to lower blood pressure and lowering the risk of a heart attack or stroke.

Skin cells detect UV light using a photosensitive receptor previously thought to only exist in the eye, according to a 2011 study.

The receptors sense light and trigger the production of melanin within hours - more quickly than previously thought - in a rush to protect against damage to DNA.

'As soon as you step out into the sun, your skin knows that it is exposed to UV radiation,' said senior author Elena Oancea, assistant professor of biology in the Department of Molecular Pharmacology, Physiology and Biotechnology at Brown University in Rhode Island.

'This is a very fast process, faster than anything that was known before.'

Scientists believe that melanin protects the DNA in skin cells against damage from UV rays by absorbing the incoming radiation and while it is effective, it isn’t perfect, which is why people must use sun block to protect their skin.

The study showed that the body mounts its defence much sooner than thought and well before it becomes apparent in the form of a tan.

Previously, scientists only knew that melanin production occurred days after UV radiation had already begun damaging DNA.
