It’s advice no betrayed woman wants to hear.

British author and relationship counsellor Andrew G Marshall says in his new book that women should apologise to their cheating husbands if they want to save their marriage.

Like many of us, agony aunt Denise Robertson couldn’t disagree more - and more battled it out with him during a debate today on This Morning.

Heated debate: Denise Robertson and Andrew G Marshall battled out the pros and cons of apologsing when your husband has cheated on you

Denise Robertson, the morning magazine programme's long-standing agony aunt, said that while Marshall’s theory might well get a man’s attention, it would be for all the wrong reasons.

‘It might arouse their contempt or it might make them feel as though they have carte blanche to do it whenever they feel like it,’ said Robertson.

‘You should not have to say I’m sorry if you are the wronged person,’ she continued.

‘It’s not always the fault of the other partner.’

Marshall’s controversial comments come from his book My Husband Doesn't Love Me... And He's Texting Someone Else.

In the book, which was adapted by Mail Online last week, Marshall says you should: 'Commit to change.

'Have you made a full apology?

'This is one that acknowledges your unhelpful behaviour (eg taking him for granted), accepts your responsibility (you've been so wrapped up in the children you've forgotten to be a wife as well as a mother), expresses sorrow and a determination to change, and is sincere.'

Say you're sorry: Marshall's believes that when a man cheats, it's his partner who should apologise to him

Appearing on This Morning, he maintained that a woman is not responsible for her partner’s bad behaviour, but said: ‘If your husband is a good man who has been behaving badly and you want to save your marriage, you need to work.’

‘You are one half of the relationship.’

Marshall argued that be criticising your partner for his affair, you’re pushing him away and giving him more reason to leave and believe he’d been right in cheating.

‘But instead, as yourself “What comes next?”’ said Marshall.

‘What would you would have done differently? By apologising you get his attention.

‘You get him to look at his half, look at what he’s done.

‘Criticising makes people angry, apologising gets people talking.’

Robertson grew increasingly frustrated with Marshall as the debate heated up.

‘You say men are pre-programmed to need sex,’ she put to Marshall.

‘Are you suggesting women aren’t?

‘There’s a grain of truth is what you’re saying but you’ve gone too far to suggest someone should apologise for the other person’s affair.’

The programme took a poll from viewers while the debate was raging.

At the end, it revealed 90 per cent of the voting audience agreed with Robertson’s stance, and just 10 percent with Marshall’s.
