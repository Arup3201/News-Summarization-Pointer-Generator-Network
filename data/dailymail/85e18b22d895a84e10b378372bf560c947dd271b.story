In airline travel, less is apparently more, at least when it comes to cost and customer satisfaction.

Low-fare and budget airlines like JetBlue and Southwest, which centre their advertising around affordability, ranked higher in customer satisfaction than their large-network competitors. 

Meanwhile, customer satisfaction for major airlines hit significant turbulence, with most major airlines falling several points from the year before.

Unhappy fliers: The pollsters ranked U.S. Airways lowest, at 614 out of 1,000 possible points

The annual survey, conducted by J.D. Power and Associates, polled almost 14,000 passengers and asked them to rank their experiences on major North American carriers from May 2011 to April 2012.

The poll ranks all airlines – discount and network – on a 1,000-point scale, based on satisfaction with categories such as cost and fees, boarding and deplaning, the politeness of the flight crew, check-in and reservation, and baggage.

JetBlue, the top ranked of the low-fare airlines, rose three points from last year’s ranking to 754.

JetBlue: 776 - up 3 points

Southwest: 770 - up 1 point

WestJet: 733 - up 4 points

AirTran: 698 - up 8 points

Frontier: 694 - up 6 points

Alaska: 680 - down 2 points

Delta: 650 - up 9 points

American: 647 - down 9 points

United: 625 - down 15 points

US Airways: 614 - down 11 points

'We are honoured and humbled to be ranked highest among low cost carriers by the traveling public, and to receive this highly-respected and sought-after industry accolade for the eighth consecutive year,' Dave Barger, president and CEO of JetBlue Airways, said in a statement. 

Meanwhile, Alaska Airlines ranked the top for network carriers, at 680 points, down from two in 2011’s ratings.

As the Wall Street Journal notes, all five budget carriers (JetBlue, Southwest, WestJet, AirTran, and Frontier) improved their standing from the past year, while all major network carriers save Delta fell by several points.

Fasten seat belts: Airlines were ranked by ease of boarding, cost and fees, and customer service, among other things

Service with a smile: Many respondents said they preferred checking in with their cell phone; the least-preferred method was at the airline kiosk

J.D. Power’s vice president of global travel and hospitality Stuart Greif said around half of the point differences between budget airlines and network carriers came down to money – their price points and fees.

‘Part of the gap is due to cost and fees, whether it’s a matter of the base fares being a bit lower,’ he said, adding that airlines like JetBlue, Southwest, and WestJet do not charge for the first checked bag.

In an era where many airlines are now charging for what was once industry standards – including free checked luggage and airplane snacks – customers showed a deep appreciation for these services.

United Airlines just announced its plan to charge $100 for the second piece of luggage checked on some international flights.

Notably, it dropped an alarming 15 points from last year to 625.

Southern hospitality: Southwest Airlines ranked second overall in budget carriers with an 'outstanding' staff experience

Mr
 Greif told msnbc.com: ‘On average, charging for the first checked bag 
results in a satisfaction score that’s 85 points lower vs. not charging 
for it.’

He called the decline in network carries somewhat ironic, in that it was a moderately good year for the airline industry. 

He
 said that network airlines could take a leaf out of the budget 
airline’s book on policies like hospitality and no fees for checked 
bags.
