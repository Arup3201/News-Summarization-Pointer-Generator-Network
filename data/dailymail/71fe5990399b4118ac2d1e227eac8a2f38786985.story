Blackpool are primed to lose two of the brightest prospects the club have brought through in years in a wrangle over pay.

Teenagers Dominic Telford and Mark Waddington remain on youth contracts and have been offered a paltry £200-a-week to sign professional deals.

That stands to decrease to £150 should the Seasiders suffer relegation from the Championship this season.

Telford is attracting Premier League interest after scoring on his Blackpool debut against Rotherham United on December 28, while Waddington started at Aston Villa on Sunday.

The strict financial restrictions imposed at Bloomfield Road mean the young stars are likely to leave the Fylde Coast this year.

And that will serve as a kick in the teeth to chairman Karl Oyston, who saw central defender Harrison McGahey up sticks and move to League One Sheffield United at the back end of last season.

Waddington has made three appearances for the Championship strugglers this season

Telford has also featured three times for the Seasiders this season

McGahey had impressed for the club as they managed to stave off relegation but scoffed at a similar offer to that of Waddington and Telford.

The departure of Telford in particular is likely to sting even more, however.

The striker, 18 last month, has scored several stunning goals for the club’s youth team this term and looks set to go on to big things.
