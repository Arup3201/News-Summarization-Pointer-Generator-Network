Sleazy pick up artist Julien Blanc has been chucked out of Australia after a massive backlash since his arrival this week. 

American Blanc was due to hold one of his seminar's at Melbourne's Como Hotel but it had to be cancelled after a massive uproar on social media. 

Immigration Minister Scott Morrison has told Sky News he decided to cancel Mr Blanc's visa, reports ABC.

Mr Morrison said: 'This guy wasn't pushing forward political ideas, he was putting a view that was derogatory to women and that's just something that our values abhor in this country.'

A spokesman for MP Scott Morrison told Daily Mail Australia: 'The Minister's office can confirm Mr Blanc's visa was cancelled and he has departed Australia.' 

Blanc described how his choking pick up technique makes him seem like a 'rock star celeb' with a 'f***ing attractive, like, magnetic personality' at a seminar where he encouraged his followers to be more like the comedian Russell Brand.

Daily Mail Australia has obtained a recording - removed from Blanc's YouTube account - of the lecture where Blanc makes the remarks, ‘Russell Brand’s Secret to Having a Magnetic Personality: Get Flashed While Behaving Like a Rockstar’.

Victoria Police announced on Friday that Blanc had left Australia overnight after outraged protests erupted over his dating techniques, which include performing a so-called 'choke opener' on women. 

He also once told a seminar how he grabbed Japanese girls' heads, placed them on his crotch and yelled 'Pikachu!'

In his remarks, Blanc said the best way to stand out to women was to 'do what most people wouldn't do and get away with it'.

'If you take, like, any celebrity, like f***en', Russell Brand, for example, what does he do?

'He does the s*** that most people wouldn't do.

'He pushes it a little bit further - that's it - and he gets away with it.

'You do that, you stand out.'

He said his choking pick up technique was an example of 'pushing it a bit further', although he recommended that attendees should not perform the move 'at home'.

'Most people wouldn't do that,' he said. 'Now by me doing it and getting away with it, BANG, now I stand out.

'She's like, oh shit, here's that main guy. Here's, like, that rock star. Here's that celeb.

'Here's that f***ing attractive, like, magnetic personality.'

He said people can get away with things like this if they do it in the spirit of 'self-amusement' and fun.

'As long as it's genuine fun, you can choke the girl.'

'That's usually my go to. If I go and choke if she like tenses up, I'm like, 'ha ha it's sexy! Ha ha, yeah, look it's like Star Wars, you're supposed to walk into it?

'How can you get mad about someone who says it's like Star Wars? You can't.

'If you want to do whatever you want, as long as you're having genuine fun, you're good.'

He said Russell Brand could get away with trouble because people expected it of him.

1. Yelling 'Pikachu!' and placing their heads on his crotch

'At least in Tokyo, if you're a white male, you can do what you want,' Blanc says, in a seminar recorded on video. 

'I'm just romping through the streets, just grabbing girls heads, just like, "head, on d***", "head, on d***", yelling "Pikachu!" with a Pikachu shirt.'  

2. 'Deadly' jokes

A blog post on Blanc's 'Real Social Dynamics Nation' website appears to suggest using cruel jokes as a way of picking up women. 

The post is titled '"My Girlfriend Passed Away" - The Twisted Humor That Inevitably Knifes Through To Her Panties. 

Explanatory YouTube videos placed in the article have been taken down. 

A Tinder exchange also published on Blanc's website shows a person, who is chatting up a woman on the dating app, suggesting that the person's father had died.

'I just buried my father today.. Who would lie about something like that,' the person writes.  

3. The 'choke opener'

Blanc is pictured choking women and hushing them in multiple Instagram posts. In one caption, written on October 10, he dubs this his 'choke opener', a means of starting a seductive conversation with women. 

4. Use 'pull talk' 

In a video on the RSD Nation website, Blanc encourages his fans to use 'pull talk' - or, 'spewing bulls***' - while physically leading women to the 'sex location'.

'Your words? Spewing bulls***,' he explains. '(They are) wizard stories, pull talk!'

'It's very light hearted, it's very fun, it's kind of like: "Oh yeah so when this, oh yeah and what about this.

 'Just any f***ing thing you want to say and again, your actions are making it happen. '

'Your actions are taking the responsibility off of her, they're leading, it's not permission seeking, and that is how you move closer to the sex location'.

5. 'Deconstruct her self-esteem' 

Another blog post provides tips about how to 'manipulate' a woman's self esteem.

'Click on this video right now that (sic) reveals how to deconstruct any girl's self-esteem,' the post says. But the clip has since been removed from YouTube.

'It's like, of course he would say that obnoxious s***. If it was anyone else, it would be harder to get away with it.'

Blanc has not responded to requests for comment despite numerous interview requests from Daily Mail Australia via email, voice message and social media. 

Eighteen months ago, he posted a selfie-style image of himself with Brand.

He did not provide the story behind the image, sounding excited about the encounter in his caption.

'Pimp it?' it said. '#RussellBrand #RightNow'. 

Blanc's forthcoming tour to the United States likewise appears in jeopardy.

The Courtyard Marriott in Seattle tweeted: 'This event will no longer be taking place in our hotel.'

Staff at another venue, the Hilton Garden Hotel in Austin, Texas, wrote on Facebook: 'We will not be having this seminar in our hotel in support of the values we believe in'.

In an interview with SBS's The Feed program last night, #takedownjulienblanc campaign organiser Jennifer Li, from Washington DC, said: 'I didn't know this was going to actually take off, I just knew I had to try in order to tell myself, "you know, I did something"'.

In a Change.org petition, initially addressed to Melbourne's Como Hotel, Ms Li labelled Blanc's pick-up techniques 'sexist' and 'racist'.  

'Julien Blanc... has made a living by teaching men how to violate women through physical and emotional abuse,' she wrote on the petition.

Ms Li went on to say the hotel should not soil its good name by associating with 'a man who chokes women around the world as part of his pick up game'.  

She asked the hotel to stand up for the women of Australia and around the world and not to host the event which would teach other men 'how to violate and harass women'. 

When the hotel announced it had cancelled Blanc's visit, it was bombarded with thanks on social media.
