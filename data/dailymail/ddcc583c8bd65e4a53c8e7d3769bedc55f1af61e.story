Victim: Llywelyn Thomas found bludgeoned to death at his home in December last year

Six people have been arrested following a dawn raid on a gypsy camp in connection with the murder of a retired farmer who was found bludgeoned to death in his own home.

Llywelyn Thomas, 76, a widower and classic car fanatic, was found dead in his home in Chittering, Cambs., on December 18 last year.

It is thought he was killed the previous evening during a botched burglary. Several items were later discovered missing from his home.

Dozens of officers swooped on the gypsy camp in Cambridge in the early hours of this morning before arresting four men aged 26, 24, 22 and 20.

They also apprehended a 16-year-old boy and a 26 year-old woman.

The dawn raid at the Fen road travellers' site in Cambridge was launched at 6am.

The 24-year-old man was arrested from the camp while the woman and the 26-year-old man were arrested in Milton, Cambs.

The 16-year-old was arrested at a property in Ely, Cambs., and the men aged 22 and 20 were produced from prison and will be questioned by officers.

Crime scene investigators spent the morning at the site sifting through evidence and searching caravans.

One traveller said: 'They came storming in at about 6am. It was scary. There were loads of police and they woke everyone up and started searching the caravans.'

Officers also searched ditches and fields around the travellers’ site.

Mr Thomas, a widower and classic car 
fanatic, lived alone in a £500,000 converted Victorian chapel. His wife,
Glenys, died in 1999 aged 62.

A silver Rover car was taken from the
property in the remote village of Chittering, Cambridgeshire, and later
found dumped five miles away in Milton.

A family friend described Mr Thomas as 'The nicest man you could meet'.

They added: 'He travelled a lot, he 
was bubbly and used to go on lots of trips. He liked engineering and 
enjoyed working on cars. It's really horrible what's happened. This is a
sign of a broken society.'

Neighbour Shirley Stronge, a 
56-year-old IT consultant, said: 'His son bought him the chapel in 1998 
and converted it for him so we assumed he had a bit of wealth behind 
him. He sometimes sold cars from his property.

'A few months ago there was even a truck for sale, which is surprising considering he is quite old and frail.'

Neighbour Greta Rice, 75, who lives 
at a nearby farm with her  husband Raymond, said Mr Thomas was a 'very 
pleasant' although 'quite reclusive' man.

She added: 'He did not communicate 
with other people that much. It is not a close-knit  community – the 
area is quite sparsely populated.

'He would be very friendly if we walked past each other.

'It is so sad to hear that he has been murdered. My thoughts are with his son.'

Mr Thomas sold his farm in Wales and 
moved 12 years ago to Chittering, a small village with no shop, pub or 
church, to be closer to his son.

The pensioner would work on several cars at once and is understood to have had as many as 20 in various locations.
