Islamic State hostage John Cantlie has told his family to ‘let him go’ and ‘get on with their lives’ - days after appearing on a propaganda video which he ominously warned was the last in the series.

In an article released last night for the terror group’s magazine, Dabiq, Cantlie thanks his relatives and fiancee for their ‘tireless efforts’ campaigning for his release.

However, he adds: ‘Let it go. Leave it be and get on with your lives, all of you’.

Cantlie - who has previously claimed to have accepted that he is likely to be brutally murdered by the terrorists - said the video released three days ago (pictured) was 'the last in this series' 

Referring to an interview given by his partner, the photo journalist says: ‘That was my fiancee, whom I hope now has long since forgotten me and moved on.

‘What can the remnants of one family, smashed and emotionally exhausted after two years of campaigning, be expected to do by themselves.’

In the article, Cantlie, 44, has also been made to criticise the international campaign of air strikes against Islamic State, claiming that ‘every bomb dropped in Syria or Iraq serves as a recruitment tool for the Islamic State’.

The magazine and video have been released in the wake of the horrific video showing the burning to death of captured fighter pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh by IS fighters and claims by the group that US aid worker hostage Kayla Mueller had been killed in air strikes in revenge for the Jordanian’s shocking murder.

There has been concern for the safety of Cantlie since he was captured in Syria in November 2012 together with the now murdered US correspondent James Foley.

Eight international hostages, including two Britons, have been executed by the group but during the period of their murders Cantlie has been used for a series of nine expertly-made propaganda videos by IS.

He is among at least four international hostages believed to be still held by IS in their Syrian headquarters of Raqqa.

Two previous videos have shown him in the cities of Kabani and Mosul and, in the most recent one, he was filmed inside the city of Aleppo walking among the rubble caused by years of fighting and air strikes while showing life going on as usual under IS administration.

He says the city had been ‘smashed to rubble’ but points to what he calls is a thriving economy.

After pictures taken inside a religious school, he tells the camera the children ‘will form the Mujahideen of the next generation.’ The British hostage talks about food supplies, drone strikes, education and sharia law adding in the video, ‘the death of leaders of jihad only emboldens and motivates us upon this path.’

Slick: The documentary-style 12-minute film saw John Cantlie giving a guided tour of the city of Aleppo

The high-quality 12 minute documentary-style production is titled ‘From Inside Habab’, the ancient name for the Syrian city of Aleppo. Dressed sometimes in the black shirt of IS and at othertimes in a brown jacket, Cantlie, who appears well if unshaved, describes the ‘advance and stretch’ of IS as ‘remarkable and breathtaking’.

The group, which has a media wing, is reported to be launching its own online TV channel, featuring a series from the Briton and a weekly programme called ‘Time to Recruit.’ Social media accounts linked to the group have begun sharing a so-called ‘teaser’ video, which claimed the channel would broadcast 24 hours a day and be named ‘The Islamic Caliphate Broadcast’.

IS already operates a radio station based in Mosul called al-Bayan, as well as a satellite TV station called Tawheed in Libya, but a 24/7 news channel targeting an international audience would be seen as a significant move by the group’s propaganda wing.
