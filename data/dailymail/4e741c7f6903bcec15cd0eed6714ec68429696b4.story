Avtar and Carole Kolar were found by their son this morning after they failed to answer his calls

A Lithuanian man appeared in court this morning charged with the double murder of a policeman's parents who were found dead in their home.

Rimvydas Liorancas, 37, appeared at Birmingham Magistrates' Court, wearing a black T-shirt and black tracksuit bottoms. He is accused of killing Avtar Kolar, 62, and his wife Carole, 58, who were discovered at their house in Handsworth Wood, Birmingham, last Wednesday.

Liorancas spoke only to confirm his name and address, through an interpreter and the case was sent to Birmingham Crown Court for January 23.

Among the people in the public gallery were the couple's daughter Michelle Kirwan, 39, and son Avtar Kolar, 32, who gave an emotional press conference last week, saying their hearts had been 'broken forever', as well as Jason Kolar, who found his parents' bodies. Both brothers  stared intently at Liorancas throughout the brief hearing.

Before the court appearance, police said that the motive for the murders of the couple was nothing to do with their policeman son's job, police work with gangs, or the theft of gold.

The murder weapon used was a lump hammer recovered at the scene, Detective Chief Superintendent Steve Jupp said.

He added: 'I can confirm that the motive of these murders was not due to the fact that Jason is a serving police officer.

'I can also confirm that it was nothing to do with the work the force undertakes in relation to gangs. Neither was the motive  in relation to the theft of gold.'

However, the officer confirmed that a number of items had been stolen from the family home. Those items have now been recovered

'The devastating impact of such a senseless crime has been far-reaching and the comfort drawn by the family from words of friends, the community and further afield has been much appreciated by them,' Mr Jupp added.

'The investigation into Carole and Avtar's death has been complex and very fast-moving.

'I would like to say thank you to those who have come forward and given us our information. It is the information given by local people to our officers that is vital and in this case we have received a number of very important phone calls.

'We are not looking for anyone else in connection with this murder but much work remains to be done to bring this investigation to court.

'The Kolar family have been updated at each stage of our inquiry and continue to be supported by specialist officers and staff. We hope that they will now be given some time and privacy to grieve their tragic loss.'

Mr and Mrs Kolar, who had been married for 40 years, were found at the Friary Road property by their policeman son Jason, 37

He had gone to the property in Friary Road to check on them after family members had been unable to make contact.

In an emotional appeal, the couple's daughter Michelle Kirwan said her parents were ‘the sweetest, kindest people’.

Referring to their brother and 
sister, their four children and eight grandchildren, the 39-year-old 
added: ‘Whoever has done this has taken not just two lives, but 16.

‘My mum and dad were the sweetest, kindest people that I have ever met and would do anything for anyone.

‘As
a family, we could not have been closer. We did everything together – 
holidays, Christmas, birthdays and weddings. Our hearts are broken for 
ever and our lives will never be the same.'

Mr Kolar described the impact of the 
murder on his family. ‘The hardest thing anyone could ever do is to tell
their children that they will never see Nanny and Grandad again,’ he 
said.

Tearful: Ms Kirwan told the press conference that after her family learned of the killing 'the light was switched out in our lives and our hearts have been broken forever'

‘I just don’t know where to start.’

Struggling
to contain his composure, he added: ‘They were so special – not only to
us, but to everybody who ever met them. They wouldn’t hurt a fly.’

Post-mortem examinations revealed both died as a result of blunt-force trauma to the head, each sustaining a number of blows.

Liorancas, who was arrested at a 
Birmingham address on Monday, was the third person to be arrested on 
suspicion of the double murder.

Two men, aged 41 and 24, who were previously arrested in connection with the murders have been released without charge, West Midlands Police said.

Last week a large cash reward was offered to encourage people to come forward with information about the 'atrocious' murder of the couple, who had been married for 40 years and have four children and eight grandchildren.

Crimestoppers has described the double murder as a 'vile crime' and put up a reward of up to £10,000 for details leading to the arrest and conviction of the perpetrators.
