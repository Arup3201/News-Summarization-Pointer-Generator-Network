Kelsey Smart who died of meningitis just 24 hours after her family were told by a GP it was just a bug

A girl of five died from  meningitis only 24 hours after she was twice diagnosed with a bug and sent home by doctors.

Kelsey Smart was initially taken to an out-of-hours emergency GP after she developed a red rash across her stomach.

The next morning, the schoolgirl’s own doctor told her worried mother that she was merely suffering from a bug and sent her home without any medication.

However, just hours later Kelsey began to have fits. Despite emergency surgery, she died from meningitis in hospital early the next day.

Last night her devastated parents Jamie and Hannah said they believed their daughter could have survived  if doctors had acted more quickly.

‘If she had gone to the hospital  after she saw the GP then she could still be alive,’ Mr Smart said. ‘I have spoken to the charity Meningitis UK  and they told me if a child that age exhibits those symptoms they should be given penicillin and sent to hospital straight away.’

Kelsey first started being sick on February 25 and continued to be ill the next day. Although still alert, she was tired, and could not eat or keep any drink down.

That evening Mrs Smart took her to the emergency GP service Frendoc, where Kelsey was examined.

Mrs Smart, 24, from Kingswood, Bristol, said: ‘Kelsey had a pinprick rash on her belly. I wondered if it was chickenpox as that has been going through my son’s playgroup. I didn’t think for a second it might be meningitis.

‘The out-of-hours doctor told me to go to my own GP in the morning. I phoned up at 8am and was told I was in queue position 13. I eventually saw a GP, who again said it was a bug and so we went home.’

Later that day, as Kelsey began to grow increasingly restless, her mother decided to take her to the children’s hospital, where 34-year-old Mr Smart was working as a painter and decorator.

On the way, Kelsey started to have fits so her mother stopped the car and called 999. At the hospital, Kelsey was given morphine and anti-inflammatory drugs after doctors feared she may have had a stroke.

A neurosurgeon also operated  on her to 
try to remove fluid from the brain, but the disease had taken hold. She 
was diagnosed with meningococcal meningitis, a bacterial strain of the 
disease.

Shortly before her death, Kelsey was christened. She died surrounded by 
her parents and her Hello Kitty toys, and listening to her favourite 
singer Justin Bieber.

Mr Smart said: ‘We have had lots of support from family and friends, 
from local MPs and from around the country, and if this raises awareness
to help another child that would be good.

‘We want to do what we can to make other parents aware of the signs of meningitis.’

Kelsey’s parents, who also have a  two-year-old son Jayden, donated 
their daughter’s organs. They  have been told her heart has already been
given to a child and that five others will also be helped.

Her mother said: ‘We couldn’t let her go to waste. She was beautiful.’

Mark Dee, headmaster of Park Primary School, where Kelsey was a year-one
pupil, said: ‘This is a tragic and devastating time and our thoughts go
out to Kelsey’s family.

‘She was such a lovely little girl who found joy in all that she did. It’s really so sad.’

A post-mortem examination was carried out and an inquest will be held into her death.
