Students will be asked to analyse the speeches of Tony Blair and Boris Johnson as part of their English GCSEs.

They are also scrutinising the commentaries of international cricket matches and transcripts of Hairy Bikers TV cookery programmes.

It comes after recent exams have asked pupils to analyse the rambling armchair stories of Ronnie Corbett and Eddie Izzard’s performances, fuelling the argument of those who claim the exams are being ‘dumbed down’.

Former Prime Minister Tony Blair, left, and London Mayor Boris Johnson, right, are both politicians who could see their speeches analysed in the exams. Blair's addresses on the death of Princess Diana and the eve of the Iraq War are two of the texts students could find themselves studying

Transcripts of television programmes, such as cookery show The Hairy Bikers, will also form part of the exams

Pupils studying English Language with the OCR exam board must write an essay on extracts of spoken language – worth 10 per cent of the marks. But critics have questioned why pupils are being encouraged to study the language of TV hosts and entertainers rather than great orators such as Winston Churchill and Abraham Lincoln.

The exams are among those facing the axe in a radical exam overhaul.

Even the commentaries on sporting events, such as international cricket matches, could form part of courses

Education Secretary Michael Gove has ordered examiners to rethink GCSEs in English and other core subjects to counter apparent dumbing down. As part of the changes, being phased in from next year, so-called ‘controlled assessments’ – such as the spoken language assignment – will be scrapped and all marks will rest on performance in final exams.

But teachers preparing pupils for exams in 2015 have been told that youngsters can study either Tony Blair, London mayor Boris Johnson or comic David Mitchell.

Critics of the courses say students should study history's great orators, such as Britain's Prime Minister during the Second World War, Winston Churchill, left, and America's President during the country's civil war, Abraham Lincoln, right, who gave famous speeches such as the Gettysburg Address

They are then given four hours of classroom time to complete a 1,000-word essay on the spoken language of their chosen person.

Education Secretary Michael Gove has launched a crusade against what he sees as the 'dumbing down' of exams

Schools are allowed free rein as to which of Blair’s speeches they select but his ‘People’s Princess’ speech on the death of Diana is known to be among those chosen, as is his address to the Iraqi people on the eve of war.

Guidance to schools says pupils should focus on how the speaker establishes a rapport with the audience, how they create impact with their speech and how they use techniques such as timing and pace.

The interviews of Jeremy Paxman, Michael Parkinson and John Humphrys have also made it onto the syllabus, as have transcripts of commentaries of cricket matches and the men’s Wimbledon singles final. Extracts from cookery shows hosted by the Hairy Bikers, Jamie Oliver and Delia Smith have also been considered suitable material.

One recent year saw the examining board use the Queen, Martin Luther King and comedian Rob Brydon as speakers to be studied.

Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said: ‘It is important that children are not denied access to speeches that have stood the test of time.

The interviews of Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman, top, chatshow host Michael Parkinson, bottom left, and Radio 4 Today Programme presenter John Humphreys, bottom right, will also be texts for study

‘Abraham Lincoln and Winston Churchill, for example, provide a much richer source of oratory than contemporary radio show hosts and TV comedians. In a study of spoken English the only real justification for studying the words of Tony Blair or Ronnie Corbett is to expose the limitations of their language in comparison with truly great oratory.’

An OCR spokesman said: ‘Where speakers are selected for the controlled assessment task, schools are given the flexibility to choose speakers or topics which will engage and interest their students.‘Speakers are selected because they are public figures whose speeches are widely available and have the breadth to sustain a critical appraisal.’
