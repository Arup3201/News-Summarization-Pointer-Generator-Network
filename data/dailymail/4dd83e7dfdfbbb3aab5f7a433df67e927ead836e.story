A stray puppy with a plastic jug stuck on his head has been rescued and finally freed from its headpiece.

The Bohannons from Magnolia, Texas, said they saw the dog around their property for two months before they managed to pin him down.

The jug, which was open on both ends, was part of a gravity pet feeder on the family's farm.

Snip: Audra Bohannon's believes the pooch - nicknamed Lucky Bucky - got stuck while looking for food

Lost and found: She planned to take the pup to a veterinarian Tuesday to see if the German shepherd mix has an identifying microchip

Audra Bohannon's believes the pooch - nicknamed Lucky Bucky - got stuck while looking for food.

KPRC-TV reports Bohannon planned to take the pup to vets Tuesday to see if the German shepherd mix has an identifying microchip.

He's believed to be about five months old. 

Bohannon says she saw the dog around her property but could never catch him.

In the meantime she took him scraps of soft food that he could lick up.

'He was slowly starving but he was eating just enough to live,' Bohannon said.

Finally on November 22 she was able to catch the pup after she spotted him sleeping and called her brother for help. 

The dog was captured and the jug cut off in a videotaped rescue. 

'It's OK baby, it's OK,' Bohannon is heard saying in a bid to comfort the dog. 

Bohannon said he was infested with fleas and a 'little skiddish' but didn't have any injuries.

Her brother and sister-in-law hope to adopt Bucky if an owner doesn't step forward.
