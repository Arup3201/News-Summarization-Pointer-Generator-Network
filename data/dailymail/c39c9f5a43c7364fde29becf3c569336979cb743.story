This is the dramatic moment a captive golden eagle was knocked out of the skies after straying into the airspace of its wild cousins in Scotland.

The 15-year-old trained raptor was hunting in the Grampian mountains with its owner when a pair of wild golden eagles pounced. 

The aerial battle erupted at 1,500ft and ended with the trained golden eagle crash-landing in the snow. 

Attack: This is the dramatic moment a captive golden eagle (bottom) was attacked by a wild female in the Grampian mountains in Scotland. A wild male had already just pounced

Owner Barry Blyther was forced to intervene to rescue his golden eagle from the talons and beaks of the wild pair. 

The trained bird, a female weighing 4.5kgs and with a wingspan of 2.1m, escaped unhurt. 

She managed to fend off an attack by the wild male  but was no match for the female of the pair. Barry, who owns Elite Falconry in Cluny, Fife, said the experience was 'terrifying'.

He said: 'I've owned this bird from when she was just a chick and she's been with us for 15 years. 

Trained raptor: The 15-year-old bird is owned by Barry Blyther, who said the incident was 'terrifying'

Prepares to swoop: As the trained bird (right) soars through the Scottish sky, a wild female golden eagle appears from above and begins to circle the smaller animal

Sent spinning: The wild female dives into the smaller trained male, who is sent tumbling through the air

Moves in for second attack: As the 4.5kg captive bird struggles to regain its composure, the wild golden eagle prepares to launch another assault

'I have quite a connection with her and my heart was in my throat when I saw she was being attacked by a wild male. 

Length: 75 - 90 cm

Weight: 3 - 6 kg

Wingspan: 190 - 230 cm

Scottish population: 400 wild pairs

World population: Around 170,000

Main prey: Rabbits, hares and squirrels

'My heart about exploded when the wild female turned up. Females are much larger than the males and she was the one who eventually knocked my girl out the sky.

'Once she had crashed into the snow I ran over and managed to scare the wild birds off. 

'Luckily, she seemed absolutely fine and after about 20 minutes she was up and hunting again.' 

There are over 400 pairs of wild golden eagles in Scotland, and their territory can range in size from three to 100 square miles. 

Adults will aggressively defend their territory and ward off any rival birds who come near. The male will usually begin the attack, and if he is unsuccessful then the female will intervene. 

Hot pursuit: The captive bird, who had already managed to fend off a wild male, is struggling to cope with the wild female's relentless chase

Crash-landing: Much to the dismay of owner Barry Blyther, his trained eagle hits the snow at speed in its desperate attempt to escape

Safe again: Once the trained eagle had crash landed Mr Blyther ran towards it to scare the wild birds away.
