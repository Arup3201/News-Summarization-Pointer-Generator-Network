Three men have been charged over a pitch invasion stunt which caused a Tottenham match to be temporarily suspended.

Nathaniel Thompson, 23, Helder Gomes, 22, and Daniel Jarvis, 26, were arrested after the bizarre scenes during the London club's Europa League match against Partizan Belgrade on Thursday night.

The match was halted shortly before half-time after men encroached onto the pitch on three separate occasions.

Spurs striker Roberto Soldado looked to strip one of the invaders of his T-shirt, which like those worn by the other two intruders bore the name of headphone manufacturer BassBuds.

BassBuds issued a statement via Facebook that condemned the actions of the pitch invaders.

'We have been made aware of an incident at the Tottenham game tonight,' the statement read.

'We are appalled that the game was interrupted in this manner. We do not condone the interruption of any sporting fixture in this way.' 

The company issued a statement via Facebook condemning the actions, saying it was 'appalled' that the match was interrupted in such a manner.

Scotland Yard said on Monday that Thompson, of Harringay, north London, Gomes, of Stockwell, south-west London, and Jarvis, of Gravesend in Kent, have been charged with pitch invasion.

They have been bailed and will appear at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court in north London on December 18.

Jarvis was bailed to attend a police station in early January in relation to his arrest for handling stolen goods, police said.

Tottenham were charged by European football's governing body UEFA after the incidents.

The second pitch invader was eventually stopped by Mousa Dembele, who tripped him up. Three men have been bailed and will appear at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court in north London on December 18
