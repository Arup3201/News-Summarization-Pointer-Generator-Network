Under fire: Sam Laidlaw, chief executive of Centrica, wants to build another pool at his mansion in the Cotswolds

The millionaire boss of British Gas has been dubbed 'Sammy Two Pools' after splashing out on a second pool in the grounds of his mansion.

Sam Laidlaw, who was paid £5 million last year, uses twice the amount of energy to heat his pool than the average family spends heating their homes.

His plans have been revealed just two days after British Gas announced price increases of 10.4 per cent for electricity and 8.4 per cent for gas.

Customer duel-fuel bills will rise from £1,321 to £1,444 a year.

But that may not unduly worry 57-year-old Mr Laidlaw, chief executive of British Gas parent company Centrica, who already has a 52ft pool at his sprawling estate in the Cotswolds.

Specialists estimate that to heat the 17,600 gallons held in the pool would require almost double the energy used in  a year by a British home.

Now he wants to add a 46ft pool and has applied for permission from his local council. Heating both would cost £4,500 a year.

Kim Catchpole, of Gravesend, Kent, told the Sun : How can Sammy Two Pools have any idea how hard it is when he wastes double what I spend.'

And Saga's Paul Green joked: 'Maybe he will be generous enough to open up one of them for pensioners to have a dip when they get a little chilly.

Mr Laidlaw, an old Etonian, was among five directors who were paid a total pot in 2012 of £16.439 million.

Energy prices have already risen by 24 per cent over the last four years, according to regulator Ofgem, ramping up the pressure on household finances at a time of wage stagnation.

The paper reported British Gas chairman Sir Roger Carr, 66, has a pool underground at his £10 million home in Kensington, west London.

In the past few days British Gas's Twitter feed has been filled with iangry customers slamming the company for the price rises,

One user tweeted: "Do the @BritishGas board prefer to bathe in £20 or £50 notes? #AskBG"Another said: "I have been concerned for some time now that your chief executive Sam Laidlaw only took home £5million last year.

'Could I set up a large direct debit to him personally? Alternatively, I do have a son. Could I give him to Sam?'

Other tweets included: 'How do you feel knowing even Mr Scrooge will struggle to afford the gas to cook the turkey for the Cratchit family this Christmas?? #AskBG" and "BritishGas #AskBG What is the best temperature to thaw an elderly relative at and what seasoning would you use with one?'
