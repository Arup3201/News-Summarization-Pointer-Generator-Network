Police had to use a chain saw to saw their way through the front door of a suspected drug den.

The dramatic swoop happened at a house in Droitwich Spa, Worcestershire, in the early hours of yesterday morning.

Officers from West Mercia Police's drugs task force wore helmets and balaclavas when they raided the property at dawn - in one of two raids carried out on suspected drug dens in the town.

After: What remained of the door following the police raid, when a large hole was carved in it. The raid was witnessed by stunned residents who watched as the police stormed the property

Incredible pictures show an officer hacking at the front door in half using a 3ft-long petrol-powered chain saw.

Three men, a woman and an 18-month-old toddler were discovered in the property along with a quantity of drugs. One man was arrested on suspicion of possession of class A drugs with intent to supply.

PC Jon Griffith, who was involved in the raid, said: 'I have been in the police 12 years and it’s the first time I have seen this [rapid entry with a chainsaw].'

The raid was witnessed by stunned residents who watched as the police stormed the property in Woodmans Close.

One said: 'It seems a bit over the top to use a chainsaw but it was better than watching morning TV.

Target: Officers approach the property, with one holding the chain saw, about to cut into the front door. Police have a range of tools at their disposal to gain entry into properties, including a heavy battering ram

'The police leapt out the back of a van, ran up the front path and one started carving a massive hole in the front door.

'I ran outside to see what was going on and could hear screaming and a baby crying from inside.

'I suppose the police have got to send a message out about drugs but it was pretty heavy handed if you ask me.'

But the force today defended the tactics, saying the raid had been a success.

PC Paul Cound said: 'We are constantly getting reports from members of the public about drug dealing and taking. It is nice to have a positive outcome from the warrant.'

Arrest: One man was arrested at the property on suspicion of possession of class A drugs with intent to supply. One of the officers involved in the raid said he considered it to be a success

Officers have a range of tools at their disposal to gain entry into properties, including a heavy battering ram and the ‘Hooligan bar’ which has a pike and duckbill and claw radius.

The chain saw is needed on specific doors or where certain conditions are identified by police in advance of the warrant being executed.

Police cadets and police community support officers later performed ‘reassurance patrols’ in the area to explain to neighbours what had happened.
