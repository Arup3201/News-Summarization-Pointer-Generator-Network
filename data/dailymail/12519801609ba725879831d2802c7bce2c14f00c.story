Shock jock Howard Stern on Monday 
apologized for criticizing Girls' star Lena Dunham by calling her a 
'little fat chick' and saying that seeing her naked on the show 'feels 
like rape.'

The controversy began on Stern’s 
radio show last week, when he described Dunham as 'a little fat girl who
kinda looks like Jonah Hill, and she keeps taking her clothes off, and 
it kind of feels like rape.'

Stern said he told his producer to contact Dunham and let her know he wants to explain and apologize for his comments.

'It makes me feel bad and I think she
is getting the impression that I somehow think she’s just a talentless 
little fat chick,' Stern said.

The 59-year-old had earlier criticized Girls for focusing too much on the exploits of Dunham's character Hannah 
Horvath. He says he was introduced to the show by his wife Beth Ostrosky
but has obviously watched enough to become acquainted with the format.

'I learned that this little fat chick 
writes the show and directs the show and that makes sense to me because 
she's such a camera hog that the other characters barely are on,' he said.

'My opinion, if I was a producer on 
that, I'd say, 'Honey, you're a little too close to the project. You 
need to allow the other characters to breathe a little and let us get 
invested in them,' he continued. 

'Good for her. It's hard for little fat chicks to get anything going.'

Unfortunately for Stern,  26-year-old Dunham is also the show's producer but she said she had no hard feelings against the America's Got Talent judge.

'I
did find out that Howard Stern really hates [Girls]. I'm a Howard Stern
fan, and really think he has earned the right to free speech and he 
should just go for it," she told David Letterman on the Late Show 
Thursday.

'But he did say something that is so funny that I wanna get it on my gravestone: 'Congrats to her 
(Dunham).

'It's so hard for little fat chicks to get anything going these
days',' she said, 'I want my gravestone to say, 'she was a little fat chick and she got it going'.

Letterman then joked: 'I think that's the essence of life's struggle,
isn't it? Before you go to bed tonight, before your head hits the 
pillow, please consider little fat chicks and how hard it is to get 
things going.'

Although she clearly doesn't need any back-up, fans of the show have since turned on Stern branding him a bully.

Several also pointed out he isn't male model material himself.

One woman wrote on Twitter: 'Howard Stern talking about not liking 'little fat chicks' on t.v. is bizarre, since he has a face only radio could love.'

Celebrity trainer, Tracy Anderson told UsWeekly: 'He’s, like, literally desensitized himself so much over the years. That guy 
doesn’t know what’s sexy. What is sexy is the way that Lena 
exposes herself, exposes her soul, wears her heart on her sleeves and is so 
freaking confident — that’s sexy.'

Others said his comments were 'hilarious' and that he was a 'legend' for turning on the popular program.

The second season of Girls premiered Monday January 13th.
