Roy Hodgson has never called up a League Two player to one of his international squads, but that didn't stop Adebayo Akinfenwa trying his luck with the England manager.

The AFC Wimbledon powerhouse met Hodgson at the London Football Awards at Battersea Evolution on Thursday, and was quick to ask for a picture with the 67-year-old.

He later uploaded it to Instagram, admitting: 'I've got to say he is actually a kool (sic) & humble guy, we had a good chat.

'I did ask if I could be considered for a cheeky England call up but don't think he was having a bar of it. Never mind, I will stick to gym & chicken #Banter.'

Akinfenwa has scored 13 goals for the League Two outfit this season, including one on a memorable night against Liverpool in the FA Cup.

Hodgson will have his mind focused on picking an England squad for the upcoming March matches, but on a night when Harry Kane scooped the award for 'Young Footballer of the Year', the England manager's thoughts are unlikely to be with Akinfenwa.
