They were best friends to the very end.

So it is no surprise that Danny the German Shepherd could be heard whimpering during his master's funeral.

His crime-fighting partner Mountie Constable Dave Ross was gunned down along with two of his colleagues in Moncton, New Brunswick, last week.

During the funeral procession Danny 
could be heard whimpering by the side of his partner's casket during the
 emotional ceremony.

He always stayed close to the hearse carrying the casket and was even photographed sniffing his master's stetson. 

According to Constable Ross's brother, Olivier Juneau-Rousseau, the Mountie loved working with Danny.

He said at a news conference last week: 'He always wanted to work with dogs and he died doing what he loved.'

Thousands
 of police officers from across Canada on Tuesday attended the funeral 
of three Mounties killed by a gunman last week in what was the deadliest
 attack on Canada's national police force in nearly a decade.

Pipers
 and drummers led mourners at the funeral in Moncton, New Brunswick, 
which was paralyzed by last week's massive manhunt for 24-year-old 
Justin Bourque.

Bourque was caught on Friday and charged with three murders and two attempted murders.

The
 three officers from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police were killed after
 responding to a report of a man with firearms.

The victims were 
Constables Fabrice Gevaudan, Douglas Larche and Dave Ross.

Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper acknowledged a 'searing grief.'

'Together, we struggle for answers,' Harper said. 'We ask what in God's name happened here and why. We may never know.'

Patriotic: Onlookers, many of whom were dressed in the colors of the Canadian flag, observed the procession

Members
 of the RCMP and municipal police forces, as well as correctional 
officers and U.S. border patrol officers, were among the more than 2,700
 who marched.

A beige RCMP Stetson was placed atop each casket at the front of the service. 

Ross's
 brother-in-law, Adrian Vander Ploeg, recalled how the officer was 
making dinner but dropped everything, including leaving the barbecue lid
 up and the garage door open, to be among the first to respond to a 
report of a gunman.

'For 
those closest to Dave, that barbecue left still open says everything 
about who Dave was and his devotion to those around him,' Vander Ploeg 
said.

So many people were expected for the funeral that 10 other sites in and around Moncton were set up for mourners to gather.

A man suspected of gunning down three Royal Canadian Mounted Police was caught and charged Friday, ending a 30-hour manhunt that closed schools and forced residents to hide inside their homes of this eastern Canadian city.

'I'm done,' a witness heard him say to police.

Police said at a news conference that they received a tip that led them to a wooded residential part of Moncton, New Brunswick, where they found 24-year-old Justin Bourque, suspected in the deadliest attack on Canada's national police force in nearly a decade.

Suspect: Justin Bourque, pictured, has been charged with three counts of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder

Constables David Ross, 32, Fabrice Georges Gevaudan, 45, and Douglas James Larche, 40, were killed in the shooting.

Armed with high-powered long firearms, Bourque was spotted three times Thursday as he evaded the manhunt that all but shut down the normally tranquil city about of about 60,000 people east of the Maine border. Nearly 300 police officers searched for Bourque, who was seen going in and out of a wooded area.

RCMP Supt. Marlene Snowman said Bourque was arrested at 12:10 a.m. She said he wasn't carrying any weapons, but some were found nearby.

Prosecutors and police declined to comment when asked if the guns were acquired legally.

Bourque turned himself over without incident.

Bearded and shaggy-haired, Bourque made a brief court appearance Friday afternoon, where he was charged with three counts of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder.

In aqua-colored jail clothes, he stared ahead intently, clearly paying attention but showing little emotion. He nodded when the judge said his name.

He will be back in court July 3 as he seeks a lawyer. A court appointed legal aid attorney represented him Friday.

Prosecutors say they were not requesting a psychiatric evaluation, seeing no need for one. The defence agreed.

There was a high-level security at the appearance, including officers with drawn weapons outside the courtroom.

Two other officers - Constables Éric Stéphane Dubois and Marie Darlene Goguen - were injured in the shootings and rushed to a local hospital for surgery but neither condition was life-threatening.
