The two companies are fierce rivals and tech fans are well and truly split in the battle between Android and iOS, yet Google and Apple could one day be partners if Steve Wozniak was to get his way.

The Apple co-founder told the BBC he wishes ‘to God' his tech firm and Google will be partners in the future.

He also admitted Apple’s voice recognition service Siri can't always live up to the same standards as Google’s Android version.

A partnership between the two firms could make phones better, he continued.

In the interview with BBC Click, Wozniak, 63, said: ‘Sometimes I say 'Go to Joe's Diner' and [Siri] doesn't know where Joe's Diner is.

'And very often usually I find out that Android does.’

He continued that Google’s success is down to the fact Android has the benefit of being directly linked to the California-based firm’s search engine and results – something Apple doesn’t have the benefit of.

Wozniak adds that Android is the ‘future of intelligence for computers getting smarter’ and wishes the two companies could join forces.

If the two companies combined, Wozniak claims the information that could be shared would benefit all those involved, and ultimately benefit the paying customers.

Last week, Wozniak ruffled Apple fanboy feathers by admitting wouldn’t be interested in buying the new iPad Air.

The 9.7-inch tablet, said to be 20 per
cent thinner than previous models, officially went on sale on Friday, 
but Wozniak won’t be buying one.

He told the Apps World conference in 
London: 'Yes it's thinner but I wanted storage' adding he was tempted, 
but in the end emailed his wife saying he wouldn't be getting one.

He additionally claims there are features on Samsung phones he wishes were in his iPhone and wants every company to share the good technology to encourage development, especially in wearable technology, including smartwatches.

Looking further forward, Wozniak told the BBC he believes we’re on the verge of having products with ‘foldability and flexibility’ and predicts this will be where the real technological advancements will lie.
