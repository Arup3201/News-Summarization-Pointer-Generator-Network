It was the quietest of announcements that had the effect of a thunder-clap on the Catholic world: A year ago today, Pope Benedict XVI said - in a voice so soft that cardinals strained to hear - that he was becoming the first pontiff to resign in more than half a millennium.

On the eve of the anniversary, Benedict's longtime private secretary credited his boss' stunning decision with opening the way to the 'enormous impact' Pope Francis is having on the church and the world at large.

Monsignor Georg Gaenswein's comments sent out a message of continuity between Benedict and his charismatic successor, the first Jesuit pope and the first pontiff from Latin America.

It also may suggest that Benedict approves of the dramatic changes that Francis is bringing about within the church - even if many seem to go against the grain of his more conservative papacy.

'We are all seeing the impact that Pope Francis is having on the world, not just the faithful in the church but in the world - it's an enormous impact - and this impact was also facilitated by Pope Benedict in resigning,' Gaenswein told Vatican Television.

'He opened a possibility that until then wasn't there, and we can see that Pope Francis has taken this situation in hand and we're delighted.'

Gaenswein is in a unique situation in history of serving two popes. While he remains Benedict's secretary, lives with him in his retirement home in the Vatican gardens and takes daily walks with him each afternoon, Gaenswein is also the head of Pope Francis' household, arranging his schedule and appearing regularly with him at his Wednesday general audiences and other public events.

Gaenswein was by Benedict's side on that Monday morning, February 11, 2013 when Benedict announced that he no longer had the 'strength of mind and body' to be pope and would retire at the end of the month.

Francis was elected about a month later and has dazzled the world with his simple style, message of mercy over moralising and a tone of welcoming that has thrilled progressive Catholics and troubled conservatives.

He has since been named 'Person Of The Year' by Time magazine and has injected new life into an institution that was crumbling following a decade of scandal over sexual abuse, and more recently over the theft of Benedict's private papers by his own butler.

As the first anniversary of that momentous day approached, Vatican officials have sought to stress Benedict's generosity, courage and service to the church in deciding to step down as they battle to preserve his legacy amid the increasing temptation to contrast his often problematic papacy and reserved personality with his crowd-pleasing successor.

It's no easy feat when no one ever made a 'Super Pope' wall painting of Benedict or created a life-sized chocolate statue of him - as has been the case with Francis.

Recently, the Vatican spokesman felt the need to defend Benedict when Rolling Stone magazine put Francis on the cover and compared his 'gentle revolution' to the 'disastrous papacy' of his predecessor.

Benedict's longtime deputy recently issued a mea culpa for not having been able to better protect his boss from the 'ruthless criticism' thrown his way over sexual abuse and the leaks of confidential papal documents. And over the weekend, Benedict's personal theologian, Cardinal Georges Cottier, said the real Benedict really only came to be known once he resigned.

'In the eight years prior, Benedict was a pope who had to be discovered, sampling his beautiful homilies and studying the profoundness of his texts. But his shy and reserved character, in addition to a certain hostility by the media, didn't completely show him off,' Cottier told Avvenire, the newspaper of the Italian bishops' conference.

'Now, after his resignation, people are beginning to realize what a big heart he has. He's a humble, good man, without any toughness.'

Benedict has largely stuck to his retirement pledge to live his remaining years 'hidden from the world' in a converted convent in the Vatican gardens, rising at 5.30am to pray, read, play piano and receive visitors.

The Pope's message of forgiveness  has resonated with both Catholics and the wider world

He has only attended one public event with Francis - to inaugurate a statue in the Vatican gardens in the summer - and he has put the lid on his once-prolific book-publication pace.

Francis seems perfectly at ease with the pope next door. They exchanged visits over the Christmas holidays and they not only speak frequently by phone but exchange written notes back and forth.

Gaenswein acknowledged that February 2013 was tough on him, as it would be on anyone saying goodbye. On Benedict's final day as pope, February 28, Gaenswein openly wept as he and the pope bid farewell to staff in the Apostolic Palace and headed out to the helicopter waiting to take them away to the papal residence in Castel Gandolfo, where Benedict spent his first months in retirement.

'For me, the last day of the pontificate was a day of terrible pain,' he said.
