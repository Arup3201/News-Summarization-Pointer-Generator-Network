Nasa has revealed a stunning video showing Mecury rotating, revealing the crater filled surface of the planet in unprecedented quality.

The false color view of Mercury was produced by putting together thousands of of images obtained by NASA's Mercury, Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (Known as Messenger) spacecraft, which is in orbit around the innermost planet.Â 

The planet, which in reality is brown, has been enhanced by engineers to reveal the huge variation in the planet's surface, revealing both fresh and old craters.

Messenger is the first spacecraft 
ever to orbit the planet Mercury.

The spacecraft's seven scientific 
instruments and radio science investigation are unraveling the history 
and evolution of the planet closest to the Sun.

During its one-year 
primary mission, Messenger acquired 88,746 images.

It is now in an extended mission, during which plans 
call for the acquisition of more than 80,000 additional images.

'Color variations on Mercury's surface are subtle, and to the human eye Mercury would appear to be varying shades of dark brown,' Nasa said.

Engineers used eight color filters on the spacecraft's camera to accentuate real color variations that are linked to the composition and texture of materials on the surface.

Areas with a redder color appear red, and areas with a grayer color appear blue.

'This view of the surface captures both compositional differences and differences in how long materials have been exposed at Mercury's surface,' the space agency said.

Young crater rays, arrayed radially around fresh impact craters, appear light blue or white.

Medium- and dark-blue areas are a geologic unit of Mercury's crust known as the 'low-reflectance material', thought to be rich in a dark, opaque mineral.

Tan areas are plains formed by eruption of highly fluid lavas.

The large circular area in the northern hemisphere is the Caloris impact basin, whose interior is filled with smooth, somewhat younger volcanic plains.

The images reveal giant craters on the surface of Mercury seen in unprecedented detail. This basin's outer rim is about 306 km in diameter and the inner (peak) ring is about 140 km in diameter

The images were created using a mosaic of pictures from Nasa's messenger spacecraft, which were then combined to create a video 'flyby' of the planet

Small orangish spots are materials deposited by explosive volcanic eruptions.

The project is part of a global color map that covers more than 99% of Mercury's surface with an average resolution of about 1 kilometer per pixel.

The view here is what an observer would see from high above the equator.

These color images of Mercury's surface were obtained when the spacecraft was viewing Mercury with the Sun overhead, so shadows cast by topographic features are barely visible.

Other image mosaics of Mercury were taken with the Sun low to the horizon, creating shading to accentuate topography.

Unlike Nasa's Mars rover Curiosity, which will be sampling rocks and soils to look for organic materials directly, the MESSENGER probe bounces laser beams, counts particles, measures gamma rays and collects other data remotely from orbit.
