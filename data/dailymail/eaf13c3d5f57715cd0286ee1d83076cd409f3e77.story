The Met commissioner in post when Stephen Lawrence was murdered said today he never 'authorised or condoned' any smear operation against the teenager's family.

Ex-Scotland Yard chief Lord Condon said he was 'shocked and dismayed' at the allegations made by a former undercover officer.

Peter Francis, who reportedly posed as an anti-racist activist in the 
mid-1990s, claims he came under 'huge and constant pressure' to 'hunt for 
disinformation' to undermine those arguing for a better investigation 
into the racist murder.

David Cameron has demanded an inquiry to 'get the full truth out' about the 'horrific' allegations that police tried to sully the family of Stephen Lawrence.

Denial: Former Met Commissioner Sir Paul Condon's time at Scotland Yard was dominated by the murder of Stephen Lawrence, and he said today he never 'authorised or condoned' a bid to smear Stephen's family

Anger: David Cameron with Doreen Lawrence, mother of Stephen, as the Prime Minister demanded an inquiry by Scotland Yard into whether police were trying to undermine the family

This afternoon the Home Secretary 
announced Scotland Yard had called in the Independent Police Complaints 
Commission (IPCC) to consider whether undercover officers had worked to 
undermine the Lawrences.

Mrs May told MPs that the claims would be considered by Operation Herne, the inquiry into the undercover operations of the Special Demonstration Squad - a covert unit set up to combat protests against the Vietnam war in 1968 and funded by the Home Office -  in London in the 1980s and 1990s.

It is being led by Derbyshire Chief Constable Mick Creedon under the oversight of the Independent Police Complaints Commission.

The allegations will also fall under the review of alleged police corruption in the original Lawrence inquiry being conducted by Mark Ellison QC.

The Home Secretary said she would be 'ruthless' in purging the Metropolitan Police of any misconduct and made clear that prosecutions could follow the conclusion of the inquiries. But she resisted calls to hand the investigation into undercover policing over to the IPCC, telling MPs that chairman Anne Owers did not believe this would 'enhance the investigation'.

Worried: The Prime Minister said today that Scotland Yard must investigate the damaging claims

Neville Lawrence, the father of the murdered teenager, said he was 'dismayed' at the spying disclosures and called for a judge-led inquiry into the latest allegations.

Mr Lawrence, in a statement issued by his solicitors Hodge Jones & Allen, said: 'I am dismayed about the new information that has come to light as a result of the Dispatches investigation. I've always felt that my family was under greater investigation than those guilty of killing my beloved Stephen.

'It is unthinkable that in the extremely dark days and months after my son's murder that my family were subject to such scrutiny.

'I've worked with the police since Stephen's death in good faith to bring the perpetrators to justice and help the police learn the lessons set out in the Macpherson report. I feel betrayed by this latest news and it has taken away the faith I had started to build in the police.

'I understand that the Home Secretary has announced that she will extend the inquiries of Mark Ellison QC and Operation Herne, I would like to make it clear that I find this completely unsatisfactory.

'I am convinced that nothing short of a judge-led public inquiry will suffice and I have no confidence that the measures announced today will get to the bottom of this matter.'

Mr Francis joins a number of whistle blowers who infiltrated protest groups for the Met Police

Lord Condon's time at the head of the
force was dominated by the Lawrence case and the subsequent Macpherson 
Report, which found the force to be 'institutionally racist'.

Damagingly Mr Francis also claims he was also asked to target the friend who witnessed the
murder and campaigners angry at the failure to bring his killers to 
justice.

Francis
also said how undercover officers were visited at a Marylebone safe 
house by Lord Condon, who gave each officer a bottle of whisky to thank 
them for their undercover work.

Lord Condon says he had 'no recollection' about the alleged visit but admits he may have met Francis.

Scotland Yard says it is 'not prepared to confirm or deny' the truth of the claims, which surfaced as a result of a joint investigation into undercover policing by the Guardian and Channel 4's Dispatches programme, to be broadcast tonight.

In a statement, Lord Condon said such actions - and the keeping of them 
from the Macpherson Inquiry into the case which found the Met guilty of 
institutional racism - would be 'clearly wrong'.

'I am shocked and dismayed by the allegations made by the former undercover police officer Peter Francis,' he said.

'I am aware how distressing these allegations must be for Mr and Mrs 
Lawrence, and I am anxious they should know the truth as soon as 
possible.

'Throughout the time I was Commissioner I was never aware of, nor did I 
authorise or condone any police officers being tasked to smear Mr and 
Mrs Lawrence in the way suggested by Peter Francis.

'I am anxious that the truth of these allegations should be established 
as soon as possible and I will do all in my power to help that process'.

Pete Francis monitored a number of 'black justice' campaigns, involving relatives of mostly black men who had died in suspicious circumstances in police custody

Spy: Peter Francis said he was asked by senior officers in the Met Police to find information to smear the family of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence

Two investigations are already under way - one led by the chief constable of Derbyshire into undercover policing and the other a QC-led review of the Metropolitan Police's own inquiry into allegations of corruption in the original Lawrence investigation.

Speaking at 10 Downing Street, Mr Cameron said: 'Let's be clear, these are absolutely dreadful allegations and we can only think of the Lawrence family, who have suffered so much already from the loss of their son.

Family: Stephen Lawrence's mother Doreen and ex-husband Neville, Stephen's father

'To hear that, potentially, the police that were meant to be helping them were actually undermining them - that's horrific.

'We have investigations under way. The Home Secretary will be making a statement to the House of Commons.

'We must make sure those investigations get rapidly to the bottom of what's happened and we get the full truth out.'

Asked whether he was concerned that lower ranking officers may have been acting on their own initiative, after former Met commissioner Lord Condon said he was not aware of any order to target the Lawrences, Mr Cameron said: 'This is worrying and that is why two investigations, one of them being led by the chief constable of another police force, are under way.

'The Home Secretary has acted swiftly to make sure that these investigations cover all of the potential allegations and we get to the bottom of this as rapidly as possible.'

Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said he was 'personally shocked' by Mr Francis's claims.

He said: 'If these allegations are true, it's a disgrace, and the Metropolitan Police Service will apologise.'

'Smearing the family of a murder victim would never be acceptable to me or my officers.'

Stephen Lawrence was an aspiring architect who was stabbed to death by a group of up to six white youths in an unprovoked racist attack as he waited at a bus stop in Eltham, south east London.

In January 2012 Gary Dobson and David Norris were found guilty of being involved in the attack and sentenced to life imprisonment, after a forensic review of the case found significant new scientific evidence on clothing seized from their homes following the murder.

MP Keith Vaz said a public inquiry is necessary to probe the police's use of undercover agents

London Mayor Boris Johnson condemned as 'utterly disgraceful' the 
activities described by Mr Francis, who says he was told to dig up 
'dirt' shortly after the 18-year-old was killed in a racist attack in 
April 1993.

'I think it
is utterly disgraceful that the Metropolitan Police Service were 
engaged in this kind of activity whether it is surveillance or trying to
discredit the campaign to vindicate the memory of Stephen Lawrence,' he
said.

'It is very important that the family of
Stephen Lawrence get answers to what I think is an absolutely 
deplorable series of allegations as soon as possible.'

Anger: Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said: 'If these allegations are true, it's a disgrace'

Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said the time has come to look seriously at a public inquiry into the police's use of undercover agents.

The Labour MP, addressing Mrs May said: 'When the select committee published our report on March 1 into undercover police officers, we expressed deep concern that Operation Herne had taken 20 months, cost £1.2 million, involved 23 officers but nobody had been arrested.

'Chief Constable Creedon is a full-time serving chief constable.

'Frankly with 50,000 documents to look through it's going to take them years to resolve this matter.

'We do need a timetable. What words of comfort do you have for the families whose dead children's identities have been used by undercover agents?'

Mrs May said Chief Constable Creedon expects to respond to the issue of undercover officers using dead children's identities before the Commons rises for the summer recess.

A Met Police spokesman said: 'The claims in relation to Stephen Lawrence's family will bring particular upset to them and we share their concerns.'

He added: 'The Met must balance the genuine public interest in these matters with its duty to protect officers and former officers who have been deployed undercover, often in difficult and dangerous circumstances.

'We are therefore not prepared to confirm nor deny the identity of individuals alleged in the media to have been working undercover, nor confirm nor deny the deployment of individuals on specific operations.'
