The race to create the first 'app watch' has been won by a company which owes its success to thousands of public investors.

The Pebble smartwatch syncs wirelessly with a smartphone allowing users to receive emails and Facebook messages, control their music and even see who is calling them.

Users can even downloads apps to their watch to upgrade its capabilities.

Timely invention: The Pebble watch, which can link to a smartphone to display messages and run apps, is being shipped to the first customers on January 23

The watch can display emails from a user's existing account

It works by connecting to an iPhone or 
Android device via Bluetooth, then downloading the Pebble app to 
transmit software updates.

Apple is also rumoured to be developing a smartwatch, although the firm has refused to comment on the plans.

Google is also known to be investigating the area.

The Pebble device was announced on Kickstarter 
last April, a website which invites people to back new, creative ventures that 
they are interested in.

It broke all records for investment, receiving $10million and 85,000 orders within days - despite only asking for $1000,000 to build a prototype.

The product will begin shipping on January 23 and first in line are those who backed the company from the outset before sales are opened to the general public.

At the moment, the Pebble gadget is available only through the company's website and retails for around £92 ($150).

The pebble watch even has a customisable face

The Pebble's rechargeable battery lasts for seven or more days and it is powered up through a USB cable.

The gadget has an LCD e-paper screen, similar to an Amazon Kindle, that allows it to be seen in direct sunlight  - and a back-light for nighttime display.

It is waterproof, shatter-resistant and there are multiple options for the display face.
