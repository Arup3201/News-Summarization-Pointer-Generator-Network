Edinburgh judoka Kimberley Renicks won gold for Scotland in the women's under-48kgs Commonwealth Games final with victory over India's Sushila Likmabam.

Renicks, the younger of two sisters in the Scottish team, scored an ippon throw to the delight of the partisan crowd at the SECC venue, as the hosts landed their first gold at Glasgow 2014.

In the bronze medal contests, Amy Meyer of Australia defeated Barbados fighter Onoh-Obasi Okey on shido penalties, while compatriot Chloe Rayner beat Marcelle Monabang of Cameroon with a waza-ari hip throw score.

Renicks was watched on by father Thomas, founder and sensei at the Kanokwai Judo Club in Strathclyde, with elder daughter Louise also preparing for a gold-medal contest in the under-52kgs division.

'It is absolutely brilliant. It is what I had been hoping for and what I have wanted for the last two years,' Kimberley Renicks said.

'The crowd have been behind all of us and it has been a great start to the Commonwealth Games.

'I could not have done it without Team Scotland and Judo Scotland, all of the fans, the family who have supported me all the way.

'If they had not put the effort in to get me to all of these places, I would not have been here today."

She added: 'It has been really tough, because I was against girls I had never fought before, so you don't know how they are going to be.

'In judo you can win in the first 10 seconds or last four minutes, and I happened to win my fights pretty fast, which was good.'
