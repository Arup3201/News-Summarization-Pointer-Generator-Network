With its glamorous stars such as Immodesty Blaise and Dita von Teese, glittering costumes and teasing routines, burlesque has never been more popular.

But although it might seem like a modern phenomenon, burlesque has roots that lie deep in the world of the Victorian music halls - and even beyond.

The old halls were at the heart of popular entertainment in Victorian London and drew huge crowds hungry for fun, music and spectacle.

Risque: Modern burlesque star Dita von Teese is following in the footsteps of her Victorian predecessors

What made them particularly successful was their embrace of a female audience; the first type of establishment ever to do so.

In the preceding years of the 18th century, everything from taverns to coffee houses had been for men alone.

Inside their doors, singers and musicians entertained the men while they dined, drank and discussed business and politics, or, perhaps after a glass or two of wine, join in with the choruses.

Singing nights became so popular that taverns began to put on musical nights in special rooms, and soon glee clubs were a regular night out for young men.

At the bottom of the scale were the ‘penny gaffs’: dismal shops where costermonger boys and girls paid a penny apiece for some rough food and drink served up with patriotic singing and comedy sketches.

Star: The 1930s American actress Jeanette Macdonald was one of the last great music hall stars

One lad told the Victorian historian Henry Mayhew, 'The songs are out and out, and makes our gals laugh. The smuttier the better, I thinks; bless you! The gals like it as much as we do'.

So widespread were the penny gaffs, there were reputedly 20 of these dens within a five-mile radius of St Paul’s Cathedral in London.

Entertaining though they might have been, they certainly were not places for a decent woman to visit, any more than the taverns and gin palaces were.

By the 1830s some slightly better song and supper rooms began to attract a more refined audience, although women were still not allowed to enter, and performers could expect a hail of bottles or boots as well as verbal abuse if their act went down badly.

Singers at venues like the Coal Hole, a notorious dive just off the Strand, would be paid £1 a week and all they drink they could hold.

They probably needed to be drunk in order to face their audiences. The Eagle on London’s City Road (famous from the nursery rhyme ‘Pop Goes the Weasel’) was one of the musical taverns, and there were countless others in towns and cities the length of the country.

Fame: Marie Lloyd, a singer, was particularly notorious and was even banned from the USA for immorality

But things were changing and the first purpose-built music hall opened its doors in the London borough of Lambeth in 1852.

The Canterbury Hall had a capacity of 700, and the early all-male audiences came to eat and drink as much as to be entertained.

A resounding success, it was soon enlarged to hold 1500 people and pioneered the concept of the music hall, including entertainment for women.

Charles Morton, the Canterbury’s owner, believed that women had a civilising effect and made a deliberate effort to attract them by introducing ‘Ladies Thursdays’.

Gentlemen could bring a female companion, but in a setting where prostitutes openly worked the aisles the men were not always accompanied by their wives.

A flood of new venues opened up in London and throughout the rest of the UK, with the result that by 1870, there were 31 large halls in London and 384 in the rest of the country.

Helped by the opening of the first underground railway line, the Metropolitan, more affluent suburban audiences could easily make their way to Town for a night out, and with money to spend they demanded more and better shows in a less risque setting.

Impersonator: Vesta Tilley, who died in 1952, was a hugely popular male impersonator

Marriage: Tilley went on to marry Sir Abraham Walter de Frece, Conservative MP and theatre impresario

Popular: Ms Tilley finally retired from her music hall career in 1920 when she married Sir Abraham

New performers were needed to fill the stages at all the brash new Empires and Palaces that soon sprang up to meet the new middle-class demand, so young women – often the daughters of supper club and tavern veterans – stepped into the spotlight for the first time. The stage offered an independent life for many of them, and stardom for a few.

A typical music hall bill would feature a chairman keeping order with a gavel, a comedian or two, dancers in daring costume, novelty acts like a juggler, contortionists, trapeze artists or trick cyclists, a drag act, and a magician.

Stage magic often employed new science like electricity or magnetism, and audiences were enthralled by the illusions.

A dynasty of stage illusionists called the Maskelynes opened a magic theatre on Piccadilly known as the Egyptian Hall, and here young women were sawn in half or levitated or chased through comedy disappearing acts for thousands of performances. 

The centrepiece of music hall, however, was music – and the star was always the singer. Men like Albert Chevalier and then George Robey were adored, but it was the women and their signature songs who topped the bill. 

Vesta Tilley was a male impersonator. She was Burlington Bertie, every inch the monocled dandy to look at, but singing in a high and very feminine voice. Retired from the stage she ended her long life as Lady de Freece, wife of the Conservative MP for Blackpool.

Marie Lloyd was the Queen of Music Hall. She had made her debut as a table singer at the Eagle, but soon she was the naughty phenomenon of the age.

In her distinctive trill she warbled innocent-seeming lyrics with titles like Oh! Mr Porter, What Shall I Do? and She’d Never Had Her Ticket Punched Before that were loaded with double entendres – innocent enough today, but shocking to the Victorians and Edwardians.

When the moralists protested about her song I Sits Among the Cabbages and Peas she amended it to I Sits Among the Cabbages and Leeks – to howls of appreciation from her admirers.

Loved: Marie Lloyd (right, with her sisters) was one of the genre's brightest stars but succumbed to alcoholism

Outpouring: When Marie died, aged just 52 years old, her funeral was attended by 100,000 people

Marie had a colourful private life; she was refused entry to the US at the start of a tour because she had shared a cabin on the voyage over with a man to whom she was not married.

Unlike Vesta Tilley’s, her ending was a sad one – she took to the brandy and fell over drunk on stage. The audience thought it was part of the act and roared with laughter, but she was mortally ill and died a few days later aged only 52. 100,000 people came to her funeral.

The grand music hall tradition lay behind later artists like Gracie Fields, George Formby and Stanley Holloway, Charlie Drake and even the Goons, but the days of the halls were numbered.

By the 1930s, they had been virtually obliterated by the rising popularity of nights spent enjoying the new films at the cinema.

But while the music halls are gone, they certainly aren't forgotten. While later shows such as The Good Old Days were a coarse pastiche of the real thing, our own modern burlesque still captures the glitter, daring and downright risqué thrill of the long-gone old halls.
