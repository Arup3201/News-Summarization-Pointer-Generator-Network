Heather Watson is out of the Japan Women's Open after suffering a second round exit to Kazakhstan's Yulia Putintseva.

The sixth seed was beaten 6-4 7-5 in what was the first meeting between the two.

The British No 1 was looking to regain the title she won in 2012, but at the Utsubo Tennis Centre teenager Putintseva, ranked 122 in the World, proved too strong.
