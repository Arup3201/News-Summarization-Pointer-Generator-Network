In custody: Olympic gold medalist and former WNBA star Chamique Holdsclaw in a police photograph released by Fulton County Sheriff's Office

WNBA legend Chamique Holdsclaw - one of the greatest female basketball players ever - has been released from jail on $100,000 bail and wearing an ankle tag after allegedly trying to 'blow up' her ex-girlfriend's car.

Holdsclaw, 35, who won Olympic gold in 
2000, has been charged with two counts of aggravated assault, possession of a firearm, two counts of criminal damage to 
property and reckless conduct after the alleged attack on her former partner Jennifer Lacy's Range Rover.

Holdsclaw handed herself in to Atlanta police on Thursday night after a warrant was issued for her arrest after the alleged attack on Tuesday.

She appeared in handcuffs and dark navy prison suit before a Fulton County judge who released her on bail Friday on the condition she wear an ankle tag to monitor her whereabouts.

Holdsclaw was also ordered not to contact her ex-girlfriend Lacy, 29, and will appear back in court on November 30th.Â 

Holdsclaw had allegedly gone to see her ex Lacy who was working out at a church 
on Atlanta's Ponce de Leon Avenue to tell her she wanted to return some items.

But when Lacy left, she claims she smelt gasoline when she got into her Range Rover and then spotted Holdsclaw following her.

Lacy, who is currently a professional
 basketball player with the WNBA's Tulsa Shock, said that she then drove to a 
nearby friend's house and upon exiting the car was greeted by a baseball bat wielding Holdsclaw.

Fleeing
 inside her friends house, Lacy claims she then witnessed her former girlfriend smash 
her car's rear and passenger windows with the bat.

It is alleged Holdsclaw then produced a handgun and
shot into the SUV.

Waiting
 until former Atlanta Dream star Holdsclaw had left, Lacy then phoned 
the police who recovered a 9mm shell casing from inside the Range Rover.

No one was harmed during the violent attack on the vehicle.

Police believe 
Holdsclaw may have poured gasoline into Lacy's car earlier in the evening and fired the gun in an attempt to set it alight.

Holdsclaw played 12 seasons in the WNBA,
 including one year with the Atlanta Dream, in 2009 - where she played 
for one year with Lacy.

She was the No. 1 selection in the 
1999 draft after four successful years at the University of Tennessee 
where she led the Lady VOls to three consecutive national championships.

In 2000, she was a member of the victorious women's basketball team that claimed the Olympic gold medal at the Sydney games.

She retired in 2010 after a season playing for the San Antonio Silver Stars.

In her autobiography, 'Breaking 
Through: Beating The Odds Shot After Shot', Holdsclaw describes growing 
up in poverty in Queens, New York and her battle with depression early 
in her career.

After her 
grandmother and caretaker June died unexpectedly of a heart attack in 
2002, Holdsclaw entered therapy but her depression continued to be a 
problem, even leading her to a suicide attempt.

She
 currently acts as a spokesman for Active Minds, an organisation 
'dedicated to empowering students to speak openly about mental health in
 order to educate others and increase help seeking,' according to the 
group's website.
