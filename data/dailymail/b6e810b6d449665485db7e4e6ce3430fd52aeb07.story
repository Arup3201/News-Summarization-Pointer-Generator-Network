Defensive: Sir Hugh Orde, pictured, blamed Government cuts for the criticism in a damning report

A police leader sparked disbelief last night by insisting officers still took crimes seriously even when they did not bother turning up to investigate.

Sir Hugh Orde blamed Government cuts for criticism in a damning report that found officers were not attending crime scenes – and were often telling victims to make their own investigations.

The former Northern Ireland chief constable said senior officers had to make ‘risk-based decisions’ because of limited resources.

He slammed the report by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary for failing to accept that forces had shrinking budgets, and sending police to all incidents came at a cost.

Sir Hugh spoke out after a nationwide review found a postcode lottery over whether officers attended crimes. In one area, officers turned up to fewer than one in ten vehicles thefts and only two in five of all crimes.

Many forces are instead asking people to become ‘DIY detectives’ and find their own clues such as witnesses, fingerprints and CCTV footage.

Sir Hugh, president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, said forces had lost a quarter of their budgets, adding: ‘Every chief officer has to make risk-based decisions. I’m afraid there is a connection between austerity and what we can do.

‘The simple fact that an officer does not turn up does not mean that an offence is not being taken seriously.’

Victims are asked to interview neighbours, look for fingerprints, find CCTV footage and even check eBay for their stolen property, according to the report

The row began after chief constables were accused of effectively ‘giving up’ on some crimes. Many victims of so-called ‘low-level’ or ‘volume’ crimes are bitter that officers did not bother attending.

Roger Baker, of HM Inspectorate of Constabulary, said offences such as shed burglaries, vandalism and car crime are rarely investigated properly

Roger Baker, of HM Inspectorate of Constabulary, said offences such as shed burglaries, vandalism and car crime are rarely investigated properly.

Instead, officers carry out ‘desk-based investigations’ in which reports are filed and forgotten if victims cannot come up with their own leads.

They are asked to interview neighbours, look for fingerprints, find CCTV footage and even check eBay for their stolen property.

Mr Baker refuted Sir Hugh’s assertion that the practice was the result of limited police resources. He said he noticed the damaging ‘mindset’ in the 1990s when he was seconded to Acpo – but was told to keep quiet when he flagged up his concerns about the trend.

Experts pointed out that low-level offending often spiralled into more serious and violent crimes, and early intervention was an opportunity to prevent this escalation.

They said asking vulnerable residents to ‘turn detective’ could put them at risk.

Professor Craig Jackson, of Birmingham City University, said: ‘Many victims of low-level offences know the offender.

‘We may be sending women victims of low-level early-stage stalking offences to investigate the crimes and meet the offender. It’s like sending the fly into the spider’s web.’

Tom Winsor, the Chief Inspector of Constabulary, said: ‘This isn’t a question of austerity. The public have a right to have their crimes investigated.’
