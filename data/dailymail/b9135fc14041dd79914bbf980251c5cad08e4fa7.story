The museum that houses the National Toy Hall of Fame is to set up a new exhibit for video games.

The creation of the World Video Game Hall of Fame will recognise the impact games like 'Pong' and 'Grand Theft Auto' have on culture and society.

To decide the initial games, the public can vote online for their favourites.

Anyone will be able to nominate a game and an internal advisory committee will choose finalists for the World Video Game Hall of Fame.

Anyone can nominate a game to the World Video Game Hall of Fame online.

An annual class of inductees will be chosen by an international selection committee of journalists, scholars and other video game experts based on four criteria: icon-status, longevity, geographical reach and the influence it has had on the design of other games, entertainment, popular culture and society in general. 

'Electronic games have changed how people play, learn and connect with each other, including across boundaries of culture and geography,' said G. Rollie Adams, president and chief executive of The Strong museum in Rochester, where the new hall is located.

The toy hall of fame will provide the model for the video version, which is dedicated to arcade, console, computer, hand-held and mobile games.

Nominations for the inaugural class are being accepted through the end of March.

'It's a great move, I'm personally delighted to see it,' said Don Daglow, who designed his first game as a college student in 1971 and said the field has been evolving ever since.

The Atari 2600, one of the original gamer consoles, shown with Space Invaders game and joystick. It first went of sale in 1977.

'Utopia,' his 1981 game for Intellivision, was the first simulation game. 

He also worked on 'World Series Baseball' for Intellivision, which was the first to incorporate multiple camera angles.

Daglow didn't want to guess as to whether he'd see his work in the World Video Game Hall of Fame.

'We're trying to deliver fun and, at our very best, we're trying to do what a really good movie or television program or cook does,' Daglow said by phone from Sausalito, California. 

Visitors can vote for any game on any system, from Pong to the very latest console titles

'We're also trying to deliver people a deeper fulfillment that you get out of a work that really makes you think.'

The Strong collects and preserves video games and artifacts through its International Center for the History of Electronic Games. 

Its collection includes more than 55,000 video games and related artifacts, along with personal papers and corporate records that document the history of video games.

'These unparalleled resources uniquely qualify The Strong to create a World Video Game Hall of Fame that identifies and celebrates the most important games of all time,' said the center's director, Jon-Paul Dyson.
