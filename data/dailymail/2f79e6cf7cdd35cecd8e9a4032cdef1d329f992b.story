When she was seven years old, Diana Markosian was taken away from her father after her parents' divorce and whisked away to Southern California.

The 25-year-old award-winning photographer had spent 15 years trying to reconnect with her father, until finally last year she showed up on his doorstep in Armenia.

Six months later, Markosian moved in with her long-lost dad in order to try and rebuild their relationship.

Gaping hole: This is the closet thing Diana Markosian (pictured center as a toddler) had to an image of her father - a cutout of him in her mother's photo album.

In her own words: Markosian, 25, an award-winning photojournalist, wrote of her long-lost dad (pictured): 'As a little girl, my father felt like a secret being kept from me.  When I would ask my mother about him, she would tell me he was gone'

Broken home: When Diana was seven years old growing up in Moscow, her parents divorced and soon after the girl moved to California with her mother and brother, leaving their dad behind

Markosian, a 2010 graduate of Columbia University School of Journalism, documented her journey in a series of thought-provoking photographs collectively titled 'Inventing My Father.’

In a first-person account originally written for the New York Times last month, Markosian, who is currently based in Chechnya, looked back on the day in October 1996 when her life changed forever.

Diana, her brother and their mother were barely making ends meet living in Moscow after the divorce, with the family having to collect bottles in exchange for food.

Then one morning, Markosian's mother told her two children that they were going on a trip.

The following day, the Markosians were in Southern California. The 7-year-old girl never got to say goodbye to her father who was left behind.

Diana's mother marked the end of her marriage marred by her husband's frequent and prolonged absences by cutting him out of every family photo in their albums.

Turning back time: Markosian's father inscribed an old photo of his daughter in Russian: 'I am searching for the little girl in her, the little girl I used to know. The one I was close to. In myself, I am looking for the remains of those feeling I once had for her'

Precious mementos: A suitcase belonging to Diana's grandfather filled with undelivered letters, a newspaper clipping and a shirt for her brother's wedding

Touching the past: Diana also got to meet her 90-year-old grandfather, a painter whose works still hang in her father's apartment in Armenia

Diana eventually forgot how he looked, but every time she saw a plane in the sky over their home, she would imagine that her father was on his way to her.

Diana Markosian knew very little about her father growing up. From the morsels of information grudgingly shared by her mother, she learned that he was a writer who enjoyed reading Vladimir Nabokov and wanted her to grow up to be a dancer.

Diana ached for her absent father's approval, so she studied ballet for eight years until an injury at age 16 brought her dream of becoming a dancer crashing down.

It was not until she entered Columbia University School of Journalism to study writing that she picked up her first camera.

She eventually went on to a successful career as a photojournalist covering the Caucasus region, Afghanistan and Myanmar.

In 2013, some 15 years after she became separated from her father, Diana Markosian and her brother traveled halfway around the world to Armenia and knocked on the door of the same apartment they remembered from growing up.

What Diana found inside her estranged parent's home was a time capsule containing her long-forgotten childhood: family pictures, her brother's old toys and her elderly grandfather's oil paintings hanging on the walls.

Dreams from her father: Diana Markosian grew up hating her father and lying to friends that he has died. In 2013, she sought him out and came face to face with a man who did not resemble the father she had created in her imagination

Two of a kind: The 25-year-old photographer admitted that she and her father share many traits, like the desire to be alone and creativity - but she still cannot call him 'papa'

Family history: Diana's father moved from Moscow back to his native Armenia to take care of his father after his mother died

In a video made in 2013 for the organization World Press Photo, Diana confessed that having been brought up by her mother to hate her ex-husband, she was filled with anger and shame when she came face to face with him for the first time in 15 years.

‘Photography gave me strength,’ she said. ‘When I wanted to leave, I knew i had to stay.’

The father and daughter looked at old family photos and reminisced about the past - both good and bad.

Getting to know her father was a jarring experience for the young woman: here before her stood a flesh-and-blood man who bore no resemblance to the father figure she had invented for herself. 

Growing up in California, she used to lie to her friends that her father died when she was a child because she was overcome with shame.

And yet the 25-year-old photojournalist was interested in getting to know her dad - and he too was eager to make a real connection with his daughter.

Diana wrote: 'Fifteen years later, I found my father standing just how I left him. In a doorway, neither fully in or out of my life'

Sibling envy: Miss Markosian said photography helped her deal with the pain of seeing his father dote over his young daughter from a second marriage

The two would have long, intimate conversations about the past and the present on their morning runs, during which Diana’s father would talk to her about his writing and his thoughts and feelings.

‘There were other moments, as well — times outside of our runs,’ she wrote. ‘The night he shared his poetry with me. The evening at the symphony when he snuck in chocolates for us. We ate them in the dark.’

The two also bonded over the photos that she was taking. Diana and her father would sit together for hours as she edited her work and discuss the images at length.

But Diana Markosian often felt awkward around her dad: sometimes when he would move in for a hug, she instinctively pulled away, not quite knowing how to interact with this stranger who gave her life.

‘I keep looking for him. I think I always will,’ Diana wrote.

For the 25-year-old, it was also painful to meet her father’s second family, including his baby daughter, and see the lanky grey-haired man who had abandoned her dote over his toddler. 

‘It's not done yet - it won't be done for another 10 years,’ Miss Markosian said of her intimate photo project. ‘It's my life.'
