Hundreds of thousands of families could be risking food poisoning by defrosting their turkeys in an unsuitable place – like the bath or the garden shed.

Some 69 per cent of Britons who buy a frozen bird for their Christmas dinner – almost 11 million people – leave it in an unsafe place to thaw out.

Just a quarter allow their poultry to defrost correctly in the fridge, a survey by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) revealed.

Nearly 70 per cent of people who opted for a frozen turkey in the UK are defrosting it unsafely, in the bath, garage or garden shed, rather than the fridge, the Food Standards Agency has warned. People are left with a turkey dinner that looks and tastes delicious but contains a hidden risk that can’t be seen, tasted or smelled.

Those who use an unrefrigerated area such as the garage, the shed or the bath can allow the spread of dangerous bacteria such as campylobacter – which is most commonly associated with food poisoning and responsible for an estimated 280,000 cases each year and up to 100 deaths.

The FSA warned that failure to prepare a turkey for cooking correctly could leave a dinner that ‘looks and tastes delicious but contains a hidden risk that can’t be seen, tasted or smelt’.

Last Christmas there were more than 3,000 confirmed cases of campylobacter in England and Wales, according to figures from the watchdog.

The bug is usually found in the intestinal tract of poultry. But the Mail reported last month how seven out of ten fresh chickens are carrying campylobacter on the skin, according to latest figures from the agency.

It declared yesterday as the national day to begin defrosting turkeys, reminding cooks that a typical large turkey weighing 11kg (24lb) will take two days to thaw.

Kevin Hargin, the FSA’s head of food-borne disease, said: ‘We all love our turkey dinner at Christmas and this year should be no exception. It’s the little things you do that can make a real difference.

‘So if you make sure that your turkey is defrosted safely and in good time, you can enjoy your meal happily and safely.’

The FSA advises that home cooks should follow the retailer’s recommended defrosting time and thaw the bird in the fridge if possible or somewhere cool to slow the growth of germs.

The bird should be covered, either in the original packaging or in a container to hold any thawing juices at the bottom of the fridge to avoid cross-contamination.

Defrosting the turkey unsafely can spread food-causing bacteria such as campylobacter (pictured under a microscope). The FSA advises keeping the turkey in the fridge as cold temperatures stop bacteria growing

If the turkey is not defrosted thoroughly, it may not cook evenly and harmful bacteria could survive the cooking process.

Online butcher Donald Russell advised using a coolbox. The company posted on Twitter: ‘Got a Donald Russell turkey? Take it out to defrost today – use the coolbox to save space in the fridge!’

However, some home cooks preparing for Christmas Day were already ignoring the safety advice yesterday.

One user asked on Twitter: ‘Large son is bringing a large frozen turkey. Our small fridge and freezer is already packed solid. I can defrost it in the garden, right?’ Another said: ‘The only thing Christmassy in my house is the turkey defrosting in the sink.’
