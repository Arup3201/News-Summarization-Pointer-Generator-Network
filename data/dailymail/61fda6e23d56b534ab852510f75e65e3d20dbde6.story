Horses are the latest victims of the obesity crisis as they take the burden of their overweight riders, experts have warned.

A study found a third of recreational riders were too obese for their mounts, leaving the animals at risk of health problems such as back pain and lameness.

They can also develop behavioural problems, such as bucking, rearing and problems following commands.

Horses are the latest to suffer from the obesity crisis - because riders are too heavy for them, say researchers

Hayley Randle, one of the  scientists 
behind the research, said: ‘People tend to think horses are such big 
animals they must be okay, and not to take notice of the weight issue of
 riders. But the health impact on the horse can be quite extreme, quite 
quickly.’

Published in the Journal of  
Veterinary Behaviour, the study assessed 152 horses and their adult 
riders from stables across Devon and Cornwall.

Guidelines set by vets state that 
riders should weigh less than 10 per cent of the weight of their horse. 
But researchers from Duchy College in Cornwall found that just 5 per 
cent of the riders passed the test.

Riders should weight no more than 10 per cent of their horse's weight to prevent it from suffering from health problems as it adjusts to its load, scientists at Duchy College said

Thirty-two per cent weighed more than 
15 per cent of the weight of their animal, a level considered to pose a 
welfare risk. The remaining 63 per cent tipped the scales at between 10 
and 15 per cent of the weight of their horse – a level seen as 
‘satisfactory’.

Miss Randle, who conducted the study 
with Emma Halliday, said guidelines should be put into place to protect 
horses from overweight riders.

She added: ‘The problem is that these 
ratios are not widely known by people in the horse industry. People do 
seem generally to be a bit heavy for horses. That is just a consequence,
 I suppose, of our average weights going up. It is definitely a 
potential welfare issue. These are broad-brush guidelines.

‘They don’t take account of all 
factors, such as the age of the horse, the breed, the style of riding or
 the experience of the rider.

‘But they are still important and helpful and people are not taking enough notice of them.’

Keith Chandler, president of the 
British Equine Veterinary Association, said his members spent a large 
part of their time dealing with lameness and back problems, which is 
often be caused by ‘the wrong riders on the wrong horses’.

He added: ‘Many riding schools are 
very aware of these problems and exactly who can ride which horses and 
who cannot, but there are some horse people who may not fully understand
 the issues.

‘There is a discussion which needs to 
take place in the horse riding community. There needs to be an awareness
 that some larger riders need to ride bigger horses.’
