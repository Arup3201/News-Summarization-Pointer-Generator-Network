FA referee grandee David Elleray, fortunate to keep his football posts after making a ghastly racist comment to a fellow official, is now involved in another alleged discriminatory issue.

Referee coach Martin Cassidy is taking the FA to an employment tribunal for unfair dismissal claiming he has been the victim of disability discrimination by association from an Elleray-led panel that made him redundant after seven years at Wembley.

Merseysider Cassidy, who has had his own health problems, was asked during the  redundancy exercise whether his wife’s illness would affect his availability for coaching.

Trouble: Former Premier League referee Graham Elleray could have landed in more hot water at the FA

It has also not gone unnoticed that 
three of the other referee coaches who were kept on after  Cassidy’s 
departure — well-known former  Premier League officials Martin Bodenham,
 Steve Lodge and Peter Jones — are named in Elleray’s autobiography as 
‘his lifelong friends’.

Elleray
 had said to black FA employee Rob McCarthy at dinner during a referees’
 summit: ‘You look tanned, have you been down a coalmine?’ He survived 
as the FA’s referees’ chief because no one made an official complaint. 
The FA would make no comment on the tribunal.

Snooker
 player Stephen Lee, who is banned for 12 years for match fixing, will 
nevertheless take part in a competitive tournament at the Crucible Club 
in Newbury this weekend.

As the event is not under the jurisdiction of 
ruling body WPBSA, Lee can play if he pays a £60 entry fee. But 
the £1,000 first prize will not make much of an inroad into the £125,000
 costs he owes from failed appeals.

Lord Coe, ringmaster of London 2012, is understood to have applied for the 
BBC Trust chairmanship for which he is the Government’s preferred 
choice. But that doesn’t mean he will end up with the job for which 
interviews are taking place next week.

Coe, who is said to have put in 
his application as a formality having been approached to apply, must 
decide whether he can balance the BBC role with his track-and-field 
ambitions.

The 57-year-old is hot favourite to be elected president of 
the IAAF in 2015 — and athletics has always been Coe’s first love.

It
 has emerged that the Byrom Group, at the centre of a World Cup ticket 
resale scandal with employee Ray Whelan now in a Rio jail, were involved
 in the tender for Commonwealth Games ticketing.

The contract was 
awarded to Ticketmaster, who ran into problems at the Olympics. But, 
after their botched services at London 2012, Ticketmaster were praised 
for their Glasgow work by CG organisers on Wednesday.

Sir
 Bradley Wiggins, bidding for a cycling track pursuit medal in the 
Commonwealth Games on Thursday, is not known as a team player judging by the
 in-fighting in the Sky cycling camp.

Yet it’s said he is taking his 
role as a senior member of Team England surprisingly seriously. Wiggins 
has spent time with the younger athletes, including the 13-year-old and 
14-year-old divers, and mixed with the rugby sevens squad.

By
 any relevant measurement, the Commonwealth Games is half the size of 
the London Olympics. Yet the BBC claim to have made significant cuts in 
staffing levels from 2012 when they employed 765 staff. But that has 
only dropped to 609 staff plus third party suppliers and freelancers — 
still an extravagant figure.

Glasgow say lessons learned from London 2012 were security, security and 
security — explaining the rings of steel around the city. But 
ridiculously the lockdown at the main media hotel, the Crowne Plaza, 
meant everyone on arrival, including one as recognisable as Gary 
Lineker, had to struggle with suitcases from a taxi drop-off near the 
hotel half-a-mile to the other side of the secured zone to validate 
accreditation passes.

The 
athletes’ village being filled to capacity, especially with late entries
 being allowed into the Games, has led to the use of overspill 
accommodation. Three Isle of Man shooters were not pleased when told 
they would have to share a room in Carnoustie. But it turned out to be 
the Carnoustie Hotel’s best suite overlooking The Open championship 
course.
