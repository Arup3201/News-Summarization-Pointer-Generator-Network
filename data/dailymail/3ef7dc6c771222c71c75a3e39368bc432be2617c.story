Embattled WA and former Hawthorn footballer Dayle Garlett could again get himself in trouble over a dangerous stunt that he filmed and posted on social media, the same day he was also charged with driving a stolen vehicle and possession of drugs.

The footage taken by Garlett, 20, shows him speeding up to 200 kilometres an hour while filming, narrowly missing oncoming traffic in the Geraldton district.

Towards the end of the clip, the former Swans District WAFL player turns the camera on himself and yells, 'I want to keep going but there's a f***ing car in front of me.'

Perth Now reports a number of complaints were made to police about dangerous driving on Monday before Garlett was stopped and arrested at around 5pm on Brand Highway.

Police have confirmed the 20 year old man from Caversham was charged with driving a stolen vehicle and the possession of a small amount of drugs, believed to be amphetamines. 

It's believed police have been notified about the dangerous footage posted by Garlett but there has been no action as yet.

It's follows a tumultuous year for the former footy star, who was touted as one of the best young players to come out of WA.

In March Garlett quit the Hawthorn football club citing he was struggling to cope with the demands of AFL football.

That same month he was also snubbed from returning to his old club the WAFL's Swan Districts, the board voting down his return, saying it was 'concerned for the welfare of the troubled former Hawthorn draftee'.

Perth Now have reported that last week, the Swans district club confirmed the footballer's family had made contact to discuss his return to the side.

But his chances of returning are in serious doubt following recent charges. 

When Daily Mail Australia contacted the Hawthorn football club for comment on the former players behaviour, they said they wouldn't be making a comment because he wasn't with the club anymore.
