So many migrants flooded into Britain from Eastern Europe that authorities were unable to count them, Whitehall admitted yesterday.

Official migration figures missed out nearly half a million people who came to the UK after their countries joined the EU in 2004, according to a newly-published document.

The scale of the problem was only revealed in the 2011 census, which showed the population was even bigger than estimated.

The admission comes amid growing concern over immigration, as Britain prepares to open its doors to citizens from Romania and Bulgaria.

Workers from the two countries will have free access to jobs in this country from the end of the year, but the Government has failed to confirm how many people they expect to arrive.

The 2011 census found there were 464,000 more people living in England and Wales than originally thought.

Now a paper, published by the Office for National Statistics, has acknowledged for the first time that the majority of the people who slipped through the net were Eastern European migrants.

Between 2002 and 2010, mass immigration under the Labour government was running at its highest.

Until now ONS officials claimed at least 200,000 were long-term British inhabitants.

But the new ONS paper said: 'At national level the difference is believed to be largely due to international migration.

'In particular an underestimate of the number of immigrants from the countries of Central and Eastern Europe that joined the EU in 2004.'

The mistake led to repeated pronouncements that there were 700,000 or fewer Poles and Eastern Europeans in Britain.

Now authorities accept that the figure is actually more than a million.

The ONS results show the difference between the official population count and the real population was more than 25 per cent in some places.

In Newham in East London there were supposed to have been 242,400 residents before the census.

That figure has now been scaled up and revised to 310,500.

Romanian and Bulgarian citizens may work freely in Britain at  the end of this year because  the seven-year period in which Westminster was allowed  to impose restrictions is at an end. Both countries joined the EU in 2007.

A BBC poll last week found  that more than 8 per cent of Romanians and nearly 14 per cent of Bulgarians said they would consider migrating to Britain.

The MigrationWatch think-tank believes around 50,000 Bulgarian and Romanians will arrive every year for the next five years.
