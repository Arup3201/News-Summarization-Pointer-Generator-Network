The scene was a desert palace overlooking an ancient wadi, its walls covered with priceless Bedouin hangings.

Inside was a feast laid on for a future king – the Prince of Wales – by a future king.

For in the centre of the dining room, sitting upright on a silver platter surrounded by a bed of cardamom-scented rice was the piece de resistance: A whole skinned and roasted baby camel.

Guest of honour: Prince Charles was offered baby camel by the Saudi Royal family as he visited the Crown Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz

If Charles felt a little queasy at this point (as many of his entourage certainly were), he was diplomatic enough not to show it.

In fact the prince, dressed in a Savile Row suit, took his place at the head table with his host, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Salman bin Abdulaziz.

As a plate of prime carved meat was brought to him, the 64-year-old managed to daintily bring a couple of morsels to his lips with a gracious smile, before cleverly pushing his food round his plate for the rest of the hour-long banquet.

‘I have never seen anything like it before,’ said a member of the British delegation that accompanied the prince, ‘and to be honest I hope I never will again.

‘As we walked in there was this huge creature sitting on a salver in the middle of the room. It was rather white and shiny with these large ribs protruding from the side.

‘It was only a few seconds later that I noticed this hump in the middle of it and realised what it was.‘We were told that it was a whole baby camel and that it was a sign of the huge esteem in which the prince is held that it had been roasted for him.’

The banquet was held just outside the Saudi capital of Riyadh on Friday night to welcome Charles, who was on a three-day visit to the kingdom as part of a tour of the Middle East on behalf of the British government.

The prince was taken from his lodgings, Grand Palace, one of the Saudi royal family’s numerous gold-encrusted residences, to the Wadi Hanifa, a short drive out from the city. 

Overlooking an oasis and the 18th century ruins of old Riyadh, the Diriyah Palace is part of an 26,500-acre estate that has its own mosque, helipad and stables.

Charles was invited to sit down with the Crown Prince and 60 of his closest relatives to enjoy coffee and high-level discussions.

After half an hour he was invited into the banqueting area where he was greeted by the roasted camel and several whole roasted sheep and lamb, which had been placed on tables for other dignitaries to pick at.

The Duchess of Cornwall was at a separate women’s banquet being thrown for her by one of King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia’s wives, Princess Hessa bint Trad Al Saalan.

The duchess said she had noticed a ‘sea of change’ in treatment towards women since her last in 2006. ‘They are in a world that can see and is starting to recognise their talents,’ she said.
