Victim: Joshua Unsworth, 15, was found hanged after allegedly being bullied on social media sites

A schoolboy found hanged in his parents’ garden had complained of cyber-bullying on a notorious social networking site, it has emerged.

Josh Unsworth, 15, had endured months of abusive messages on his profile on  Ask.fm, which has been described by child safety experts as a ‘stalker’s paradise’.

At one point his father Gary, 46, apparently took over the page, threatening to report the abusers to police. Josh himself wrote: ‘Last time I checked, cyber-bullying and “trolling” were a criminal offence.’ 

Ask.fm has been heavily criticised by anti-bullying charities because it allows users to post anonymous comments or questions – often of a sexual or insulting nature – on the pages of children as young as 13.

It is not covered by British online safety regulations as it is based in Latvia.

An investigation into Josh’s death is at an early stage, and police who have spoken to his family say they have not been made aware he had problems with bullies.

Nevertheless, friends have taken to Facebook to blame bullies for the tragedy.

One wrote: ‘R.I.P Josh Unsworth, we’ll forever remember you! Bullied to death.’ Another said: ‘I hope your bullies can’t sleep at night knowing what they did to you.’ 

Josh, whose father is sales director of a haulage firm, attended St Cecilia’s Roman Catholic High School in Longridge, Lancashire.

His body was found in the garden of the family’s stone-built converted farmhouse in a nearby village last Thursday morning.

The headteacher of Joshua's school asked parents to make children aware of the effects of cyber-bullying

His parents, Gary and Michelle, both 46, yesterday said: ‘Our son Joshua
 was a thoughtful, loving, compassionate boy. We will miss him dearly.’

Teachers are understood not to have been aware of problems with bullies,
 but posts on Joshua’s Ask.fm profile page – which remained online 
yesterday – make worrying reading.

Last September, an anonymous poster wrote that he was a ‘f****** 
n*****d’. It went on: ‘honestly no one cares for you even your parents 
don’t want you, there (sic) gunna put you in care’.

In response, Josh wrote that his father had looked at his account and 
planned to report the abuse to police. Messages apparently written by Mr
 Unsworth followed, demanding an apology and adding he had called the 
police.

Some posts appeared to mock Josh’s father’s occupation, calling the 
teenager a ‘farmer’, while others accused him of mistreating girls and 
acting like ‘a player’.

In response to a post stating ‘no one likes you’, Josh apparently 
replied: ‘Let me tell you within that time I have learnt that words are,
 well, just words so whatever your miserable low life self thinks of me 
can say to my face or on here knowing I don’t care.’ Many posts however,
 contained supportive messages, apparently from friends.

Joshua was a year 11 pupil at St Cecilia's Roman Catholic High School in Longridge

Josh’s headteacher, Steve Tattersall, said he would be asking parents to
 speak to their children about the possible impact of negative comments 
on social media.

He said: ‘I’m aware of some of the comments that are being made about 
Josh’s sad death on social networks, both by those who knew him, and 
those who did not.’

He added: ‘Josh was always a smiling, friendly presence in school  which
 made him very popular.’  Schools across the country have written to 
pupils in recent months urging them not to use Ask.fm, which has more 
than 30 million users worldwide.

Earlier this year Jim Gamble, former chief executive of the  Child 
Exploitation and Online  Protection Centre, said the site  had been 
linked with a number of recent teen suicides in Ireland and the US.

He said: ‘It is almost a stalker’s paradise. Young people need 
protection from those who exploit internet anonymity to intimidate, 
isolate and bully.’ 

Lancashire police said: ‘We are in the very early stages of an 
investigation and it would be premature to speculate about the possible 
reason for his death.’ An inquest will be held at a later date.

Ask.fm could not be reached for comment.
