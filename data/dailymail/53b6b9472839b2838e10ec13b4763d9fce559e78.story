It will be the most unforgettable private party of the year - spread across the globe in 120 cities over three days at 360 luxury venues.

And if your invitation has not turned up yet, don't worry you can buy your way into the star-studded gatherings.

Around 360,000 guests will be mixing with stars of film and music, top models and millionaires and all the proceeds from the big bashes in June will go to charity.

Cities ranging from Monte Carlo to Medellin in Colombia, London to Fiji and Melbourne will get the parties going with a bang.

Some wealthy guests have already indicated they will be flying by private jet to join parties on other continents.

The extravaganza is the brainchild of former Conservative party donor and treasurer Lord Fink who is hosting a pre-party dinner for 120 VIP guests at London's Savoy Hotel.

Among the likely invites are model Lily Cole, Roxy Music singer Bryan Ferry, actress Uma Thurman and her partner, millionaire financier Arpad Busson.

Mayor Boris Johnson is tipped to cut a red ribbon to launch the global party at midnight. Anybody who can afford a £500 donation to Fink's Global Charity Trust will get a pair of invitations to a venue of their choice.

The donors' 'plus ones' are being asked for a payment that matches an hour's worth of their time.

Guests can go to as many of the parties around the world as they want if they pay £1,000 for the privilege.

The venues include the Ice Bar in Fiji, the Silk Road restaurant in Melbourne and the Taj Mahal Palace hotel in Mumbai.

David Johnstone, Fink's business partner and chief executive of the Global Party initiative, told the Sunday Times: 'You could very easily start in Italy, come up to Paris, go to London and you could probably get to New York in time.

'There are people who have spoken to me who want to do that.'

A local children's charity will benefit from bar takings and auctions at each venue, including those supported by Prince William and Prince Harry.

Fink, 55, a former hedge fund manager and chief executive, who is said to be worth £135 million, organised a smaller Phineas Fogg charity version in 2011.

Around 80,000 guests went to 80 venues over two days.

This year he is kicking off proceedings on the Orient Express train.
