The remains of the body found in a remote cabin razed to the ground have been positively identified as fugitive ex-LAPD officer Christopher Dorner

Authorities say fugitive former cop Christopher Dorner died of a single gunshot wound to the head as authorities were pumping 
tear gas into a mountain cabin during a deadly gun battle with sheriff's
deputies.

San Bernardino County sheriff's Capt. Sheriff John McMahon told reporters Friday that it appears the wound was self-inflicted.

Deputies said they heard one final gunshot from the cabin as it was going up in flames during Tuesday's gunbattle.

Before he died, Dorner killed one sheriff's deputy and wounded another during a fierce shootout.

Authorities
initially were unsure whether Dorner killed himself, had been struck by
a deputy's bullet or had died in a fire that engulfed the cabin during 
the shootout.

The search for Dorner began last week after authorities said he had launched a deadly revenge campaign against the Los Angeles Police Department for his firing, warning that he would bring 'warfare' to LAPD officers and their families.

The manhunt brought police to Big Bear Lake, 80 miles east of Los Angeles, where they found Dorner's burned-out pickup truck abandoned. His footprints disappeared on frozen soil and hundreds of officers who searched the area and checked out each building failed to find him.

Five days later, but just a stone's throw from a command post authorities had set up in the massive manhunt, Karen and Jim Reynolds said they came face to face with Dorner inside their cabin-style condo.

The couple said Dorner bound them and put pillowcases on their heads. At one point, he explained that he had been there for days.

'He said `I don't have a problem with you, so I'm not going to hurt you,'' Jim Reynolds said. 'I didn't believe him; I thought he was going to kill us.'

Police have not commented on the Reynolds' account, but it renews questions about the thoroughness of a search for a man who authorities declared was armed and extremely dangerous as they hunted him across the Southwest and Mexico.

'They said they went door-to-door but then he's right there under their noses. Makes you wonder if the police even knew what they were doing,' resident Shannon Schroepfer said. 'He was probably sitting there laughing at them the whole time.'

The notion of him holed up just across the street from the command post was shocking to many, but not totally surprising to some experts familiar with the complications of such a manhunt.

'Chilling. That's the only word I could use for that,' said Ed Tatosian, a retired SWAT commander for the Sacramento Police Department. 'It's not an unfathomable oversight. We're human. It happens. It's chilling (that) it does happen.'

Candy Martin, the owner of the remote mountain cabin, said she was helpless as the building in the San Bernardino National Forest became the center of a raging gun battle on Tuesday that killed one sheriff's deputy, wounded another wounded and left the fugitive murder suspect Christopher Dorner dead.

Ms Martin said she flipped on the television on Tuesday afternoon and realized that the cabins featured on the breaking news coverage of the standoff looked familiar.

'And we’re looking and we say, "Oh these are cabins, these look like," and there’s no doubt that those are my cabins,' she told NBC 4 in Los Ageles.

Ms Martin bought the Seven Oaks Cabins, situation in the forest about 20 miles from Big Bear, California, in 2005 as a mountain getaway for her extended family.

'It’s hard for me to imagine him in there. And I did do that. I imagined, what is he doing? What room is he in?' she told the TV station.

The home had solid wood paneling and floors and contained a lot of history, It was built in 1928 and the compound was the set for several movies and TV shows, Ms Martin said.

Watching the home burn to the ground on live TV was the hardest part, she said.

'Then the fire. Oh my gosh,' Ms Martin said. 'That was heart wrenching to see, the fire. I just started crying. I couldn’t talk at that point.'

Ms Martin said that when her family is not staying on the mountain in the cabins, she rents out several of the buildings to tourists and advertises the site as a tranquil, peaceful mountain paradise.

'Leave behind the stress and smog of the big city.  Be our guest in a cabin nestled in the woods and on the banks of the Santa Ana River,' the website reads.

However, several online reviewers have begun posting outrageous comments in the wake of the siege.

'The underground tunnel feature is just great! Comes in handy!' wrote one reviewer on the Yahoo Travel site for the Seven Oaks cabins.

'A little hot today. The rates are very reasonalbe [sic] since I didn't pay anyway. Good luck on the renovation,' a user calling himself 'Great SPOT for a BBQ' writes.

Dorner barricaded himself inside the cabin after a series of dramatic police chases and shootouts on Tuesday afternoon.

Taking cover: Heavily-armed officers surrounded the property and took cover around the other cabins

Killed: Detective Jeremiah MacKay, 35, was shot dead during the standoff with Dorner

The former U.S. Navy Reserve lieutenant made his way to Big Bear, 100 miles east of Los Angeles, last Thursday after he went on a revenge killing spree that left three people dead. 

He is believed to have shot dead the daughter of a former LAPD captain who defended him at a police review board hearing where Dorner was fired in 2009. Monica Quand was found murdered in her car in Irvine, along with her fiance Keith Lawrence on February 3.

Last Thursday, he wounded an LAPD officer in a shootout and then ambushed two Riverside police - killing Officer Michael Crain and gravely wounded a second patrolman.

Later that afternoon, Dorner's burning truck was found in the woods outside Big Bear. Despite an intense police search of the area for several days, Dorner was revealed to be hiding in vacant condos just across the street from the San Bernardino County Sheriff's command post.

On Tuesday, he surfaced after five days of hiding and tied up a couple after breaking into their home. He stole their SUV, but crashed it during a police pursuit.

Dorner then carjacked a Boy Scout leader's truck. He abandoned the vehicle and fled for Ms Martin's cabins after a shootout with a California game warden.

San Bernardino SWAT officers surrounded the cabin and engaged Dorner in a raging firefight.

Detective Jeremiah MacKay, 35, was shot and killed when Dorner tried to make an escape. A second deputy was gravely wounded.
