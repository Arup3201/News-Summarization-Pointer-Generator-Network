A penguin picked up a GoPro and was about to swallow the camera â€“ before realising it was not in fact the tasty treat it had in mind.

Footage shows the Gentoo penguin spotting the camera and sprinting over before giving it an inquisitive peck.

Fortunately the camera is too big to swallow, so the penguin waddles off in search of something edible.

The footage was captured on Cuverville Island in Antarctica, home to a large Gentoo penguin colony.

Alex Cowan, on-board geologist on the adventure tours vessel MS Expedition, which is owned and operated by G Adventures, left the camera buried in the snow.

Cuverville Island, situated in the Errera Channel, is well-known for its large Gentoo colonies and abundant icebergs, while late in the year humpback whales are frequently seen feeding and breaching in the area.
