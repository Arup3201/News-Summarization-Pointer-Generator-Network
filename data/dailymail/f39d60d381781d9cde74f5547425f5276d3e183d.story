Chipotle founder Steve Ells has sold his four-bedroom townhouse in Manhattan's West Village for $11.4 million.

The 4,400 square foot property’s lucky new owner is Lyor Cohen, a music mogul who dated designer Tory Burch for five years, before breaking up in 2013.

Mr Cohen has actually been residing in the property on a rental-basis for the last year, and bartered the home’s price down from its original listing of $16.5 million. He previously lived in a six-story townhouse on the Upper East Side

His new home - a 24-foot-wide townhouse - has four bedrooms, four bathrooms, and a backyard terrace. The Greek-revival structure dates back to 1898.

Its brick façade lends an old-world touch to what is otherwise a thoroughly modern house.

Photos show rooms decorated with contemporary and post-modern inspired furniture.

Dubbed ‘The House that Burritos Built’ by Business Insider, the home includes many intimate living spaces that are scattered with pieces designed by Jonathan Adler and Ligne Roset.

One such room has two Andy Warhol flower prints hanging on its wall.

While the property’s street-facing façade is routed in old-world New York, its backside has an entirely different look.

Floor-to-ceiling sleek glass windows envelop the back wall of each room, all of which overlook a grassy backyard.

Mr Ells, 48, purchased the property in 2008 for $13,425,000. It is unknown if he has ever lived there, as he owns additional homes in the city too.

In March 2008 Mr Ells paid $5.753 million three-bedroom loft that is also located in the West Village. He sold it in 2011 for $6.1 million.

Mr Ells currently maintains a penthouse on Fifth Avenue, which he purchased in 2009 for $11 million.

The restaurateur, who also owns an Asian-style bistro chain called Shophouse, has been looking to sell off his Jane Street property for the last year.

Mr Cohen, 54, is the former North American Chariman and CEO of the Warner Music Group.

The Israeli-American, who was raised in New York, counts Jay-Z and Jon Bon Jovi among some of his closest friends. He is considered one of the most powerful men in the American music industry.
