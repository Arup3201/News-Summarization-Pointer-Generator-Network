Researchers believe they have found a family crypt belonging to the Knight recently found buried under an Edinburgh car park.

Seven full and one partial skeleton have been found, including an adult female and infant skeleton, just yards from the area the Knight was discovered earlier this year.

Archaeologists believe this could be the remains of a family crypt, and say the may find more human remains.

The discoveries were all made under a car park that was formerly that of the 13th century Blackfriar¿s Monastery and later the the sixteenth century Old High School and seventeenth century Royal High School

Ross Murray, the archaeologist who is leading the dig, said 'This site just keeps getting more and more interesting, it is turning out to be a real treasure trove of archaeology.

'We just can’t seem to stop finding skeletons and bones.

'These new finds looks likely to be the possible relations of the suspected Medieval Knight we found earlier this year.

'The skull of the skeleton found immediately beneath the location of the Knight looks like that of a female and the remains found on the other side of the ornate slab belong to an infant from the same period.'

The discoveries were all made under a 
car park on the building site of the new Edinburgh Centre for Carbon 
Innovation (ECCI) building in the Old Town of Edinburgh.

The site was 
formerly that of the 13th century Blackfriar’s Monastery and later the 
the sixteenth century Old High School and seventeenth century Royal High
School.

Excavation will continue on the site for at least another two weeks with the ‘skeleton count’ already in double figures.

The finds comes just weeks after the 
first body, believed to be a knight, was found near the foundations of a
13th century monastery.

In life, he would have been among the social elite, a man of honour and privilege befitting his warrior status.

But,
in death, it seems the Scottish knight was destined to suffer the same 
indignity as King Richard III – being buried on a site that was to be 
later covered by a car park.

Only
months after the king’s 500-year-old corpse was found in 
Leicestershire, the grave of a medieval knight was uncovered in 
Edinburgh.

The researchers say they expect to discover more graves at the site

Workers were taken aback when they came across a sandstone slab decorated with elaborate carvings of a cross and a sword.

They called in archaeologists, who found a man's skeleton beneath the stone.

The inscription on the gravestone signifies the skeleton is that of a knight.

The knight's skeleton and teeth are in good condition and have been removed by forensic experts, who will examine them in an attempt to find out as much as they can about his life and death.

The site where the knight was found was once a 13th-century Blackfriars Monastery founded by King Alexander II of Scotland, but was destroyed during the Protestant Reformation in 1558.

Archaelologists say the knight would have paid a toll to the local monastery over the course of his life to make sure he was buried in religious grounds.

This is not the first time that 
archaeologists have excavated in the area.

The sites of the 18th- 
century Old High School and the 16th-century Royal High School were 
found only yards from the knight’s grave.

Astonished by his unexpected 
discovery, Ross Murray of Headland Archaeology, who studied at a 
University of Edinburgh building yards from where the knight was buried,
said: ‘We obviously knew the history of the High School Yards site 
while we were studying here.

'But I never imagined I would be back here 
to make such an incredible discovery.

‘We
used to take breaks between classes just a few feet away from the 
building’s doorway - and all the time the grave was lying under the car 
park.’

The car park in the Old Town was being demolished to make way for the Edinburgh Centre for Carbon Innovation (ECCI).

The innovative green building has been designed to be highly efficient and sustainable – and is even fitted with a tank which harvests rainwater.

But the building of the future will have to wait as historians go back in time on the site.

ECCI director Andy Kerr said: ‘We always knew that the building retrofit might uncover historical artefacts, given the site’s history – but this knight is an extraordinary and exciting find.

‘We want our new building to play a key role in shaping Scotland’s future, as these historical buildings on this site did in their time.’  

Richard Lewis, culture convener for the City of Edinburgh Council said: 'This find has the potential to be one of the most significant and exciting archaeological discoveries in the city for many years, providing us with yet more clues as to what life was like in medieval Edinburgh '.

After King Richard III’s remains were found in a car park in 2012 Leicester cathedral yesterday revealed there will be no grand tomb when his remains are reinterred later this year.
