Elle Macpherson's former adviser today claimed she was bullied into going to rehab after her client became convinced she was leaking stories to the press.

Giving evidence to the Leveson Inquiry, Mary Ellen Field described how the supermodel confronted her and accused her of being an alcoholic who was unintentionally passing private details to journalists.

She was told she had to go to therapy centre The Meadows, in Arizona, otherwise she would be immediately sacked.

Mrs Field said that she at first resisted - but eventually felt she had no choice but to go. She completed the programme and was then dismissed by the model.

It eventually emerged that the probable source of the stories was voicemails that had been hacked on the behest of the News of the World.

Mrs Field, who is a specialist in intellectual property rights, laid out how she was working for an international tax and accountancy firm when she met Ms Macpherson in
2003.

She said she got on well with the model - who, like her, came from Sydney, Australia - and Ms Macpherson quickly became her client.

Mrs Field said the partnership was 'very successful' from both a 'financial' and 'developmental' point of 
view and they became friends. She told the inquiry the model would confide in her.

But their relationship began to deteriorate after a series of stories appeared in the papers in 2005.

These revolved around the breakdown of Ms McPherson's relationship to financier Arpad Busson. Mrs Field described the articles as 'tittle-tattle.'

She said the model became concerned about 'listening devices' and security checks were carried out but nothing was found.

A former Premiership footballer who tried to stop a tabloid paper publishing details of his adultery suggested today that journalists may have hacked his phone.

Ex-Blackburn Rovers captain Garry Flitcroft took out an injunction in April 2001 to prevent the People newspaper running a 'kiss and tell' story about a brief affair.

This was overturned by the Court of Appeal in early 2002, leading to public humiliation for the married father when his name was finally disclosed.

Flitcroft told the Leveson Inquiry into press standards today that he 'strongly suspected' that reporters hacked his phone to discover details of a second woman with whom he had an affair.

But he admitted he had no firm evidence that his voicemail messages were illegally intercepted.

He told the inquiry: 'That is just speculation. I have no evidence at all. It just seems a massive coincidence that the same newspaper gets two girls in the space of a couple of months.'

Flitcroft, who is now manager of Northern Premier League side Chorley FC, said he had an 'intimate relationship' with the first woman, whom he saw 'three or four times'.

He claimed that she contacted him threatening to go to the press if he did not give her £3,000 for a breast enlargement operation, which he refused.

The former footballer said the woman sent an envelope to his mother's house containing copies of text messages he had sent her and details of precisely when they went to a hotel together.

Flitcroft said he showed the envelope to the solicitor of the Professional Footballers' Association, and as a result took out the injunction against the People.

Explaining why he resorted to legal action, he said: 'I hold my hands up and I know I did wrong, but nobody's perfect and at the end of the day I had a wife and a kid, and I had a very close family, and I did not want it to get out to them.'

The inquiry heard that the People was edited at the time by Neil Wallis, who went on to become executive editor of the News of the World.

Flitcroft said the People printed hints about his identity, such as that he played for an 'unfashionable' club in the North West, before the injunction was overturned.

The Bolton-born father-of-three, who is now separated from his wife and living with his girlfriend, Sarah Lancashire, said he was subsequently contacted by the second woman, who demanded £5,000 in return for not selling her story to the People.

He said he was surprised by this because the first woman lived in Chester and the second in Stockport, and they did not know each other.

'I strongly suspect that my phone was hacked by journalists and as a result the second woman was contacted, and asked to sell her story to the papers,' he said in a statement to the inquiry.

Carine Patry Hoskins, counsel to the inquiry, said both women denied blackmailing Flitcroft.

Mrs Field said she was contacted by a 
lawyer representing Ms Macpherson and told that the model was 'not prepared
to have me speaking in the press any more'.

'I was amazed. So I called Elle,' said Mrs Field. 'It was the first time she was really grouchy with me. 
She said "I can't have you speaking to the media. You have been speaking
to the press".'

Mrs Field told the inquiry that she had 'absolutely not' been speaking to the media about Ms Macpherson.

The situation finally came to a head 
when Mrs Field returned home to find her husband had received a phone call from the model's lawyer.

He
had said she was going to be sacked, adding 'Elle says she knows you 
weren't doing it on purpose. You did it because you're an alcoholic'.

Mrs Field agreed to attend a meeting with the model a few days later.

'Elle
wanted to see me on her own,' she told Lord Justice Leveson. I went in 
and she puts her arms around me and cries and she says she knows what 
it's like to be an alcoholic.

'She says she know I would never have spoken to the media if I was not an alcoholic.'

Mrs Field told the inquiry that after half an hour of 'psychobabble', she asked to see her husband.

He came in, along with representatives from Mrs Field's firm Chiltern and the supermodel's lawyer.

'I know it sounds like a B-movie,' Mrs Field continued. 'They proceeded to trash my reputation, trash everything and said I had to go to this place. I wasn't going to go.'

Mrs Field and her husband left the meeting and went home. At that stage she was still adamant that she would not go into rehab.

But a few days later, at a second meeting with the model, she gave in.

'She totally broke me down and I gave in and went to this horrible place,' she said. 'Elle had made out it was a spa. It was a grade one psychiatric hospital with men with guns parading around.

'For the first ten days you're in this hospital where there's no plugs in the hand basins in case you drown yourself. They try and make you take anti-depressants. I wouldn't take them and they thought I was hostile.

'I'm a runner 
and I wanted to use the gym and they wouldn't let me because they said 
it was 'obsessive behaviour'...

'They said I was getting intervention - like in those CIA renditions.

'I had to share a dormitory. One woman injected drugs between her toes. I'd never met anyone like that before. It was hard.

'After ten days they said that I wasn't an alcoholic and that I'd been bullied.' Mrs Field was diagnosed with adjustment disorder which she described as the American phrase for stress.

But she stayed for the five-week programme - which was being paid for by her firm and Ms MacPherson - and then returned to work. She told Lord Justice Leveson that she had 'kept her side of the bargain' and believed that things would return to normal.

However, she was immediately fired by Ms Macpherson and later made redundant by Chiltern in March 2006.

Mrs Field said it was not until the arrest of News 
of the World royal editor Clive Goodman and private investigator Glenn 
Mulcaire in August 2006 that she realised what had happened.

The financial adviser said her experience had had a massive impact on her - both professionally and personally.

She attributed the decline in her health, which eventually led to her having a pacemaker fitted in 2009, as at least partly related to what had happened.

Mrs Field has spoken to police about her phone being hacked and is seeking damages through the High Court.
