A leading sandwich firm has cut the size of its baguettes and is no longer putting two tea bags in large cups, it emerged today.

SSP, which runs outlets including Upper Crust and Caffe Ritazza in more than 100 stations and airports, has reduced the length of baguettes by nearly ten per cent.

The company admitted that, despite the reduction in the amount of food customers are getting, not all prices are being cut.

The firm behind Upper Crust says it has reduced the size of its baguettes by nearly ten per cent

The reduced sandwich size is just the latest in a series of admissions by food producers that portions are getting smaller.

A spokesman for SSP told The Times the reduced size was not a money-saving ploy, but merely a move to bring the sandwiches 'in line with their competitors'.

They claimed they now use stronger tea bags in large teas, meaning they did not need to put two bags in one cup.

The spokesman also denied claims that workers had been told only to hand out napkins to customers who ask for them.

But the move have been criticised by consumer groups, who say customers want honesty from firms.

Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: 'Shrinking products can be an underhand way of raising prices because pack sizes shrink but the prices don't. 

'We want simpler pricing so people can easily compare products to see which is the cheapest, and for special offers to be genuine. ' 

SSP runs more than 109 Upper Crust units in 17 countries, including many at railway stations and airports

An SSP spokesman said: 'Similar to many retailers we conduct range reviews on an ongoing basis to ensure we meet our customers expectations.

'These range reviews cover all aspects of the mix: merchandising, price and product specification. As part of this process, whilst the size of some of our range has been reduced, the price of the majority of these products has also been reduced‎.'

Last year, High Street bakery Greggs came in for criticism after it emerged best-selling snacks, including steak bakes, bacon rolls and pizzas, had shrunk in size.

But the bakery giant defended the reduced size of its food, insisting they were better for customers' waistlines.

Mars gave the same explanation for reducing the size of Twix bars, claiming it was due to demands to reduce calorie content. 

Which? examined the changes in size of food products in the study released last year.

It found Walkers Crisps had shaved 6 per cent off its pack size, bringing them down to 32.5g. The 49p price remained the same, however.

Bassetts Liquorice Allsorts had also came down from 215g to 190g, which is 12 per cent or six sweets, without any reduction in the price.

Dolmio reduced the contents of its Express Creamy Carbonara Pasta Sauce from 330g to 300g.

Last year, Which? released figures which showed a number of food products are now smaller than before
