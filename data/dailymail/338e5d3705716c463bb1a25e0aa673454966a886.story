Members of a sadistic paedophile ring convicted of grooming vulnerable underage girls for sexual exploitation threatened to decapitate the baby of one of their young victims, a court heard today.

The Old Bailey in central London was also told that one of the Oxford-based sex ring’s victims has considered suicide while another suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of the abuse.

Statements from some of the victims' parents were read out in court ahead of the sentencing of the gang, in which they described how the seven defendants had ruined their daughters' lives.

Evil: Six of the defendants listened from the dock, but the court heard that Mohammed Karrar (left), 38, had refused to come up from the cells. He was convicted last month with his brother, Bassam Karrar (right), 34

The court heard the extent of the girls' psychological damage, with one admitting she is prone to depression and self-harming, while another suffers nightmares, panic attacks and flashbacks.

A statement from the mother of that girl said her daughter developed chronic insomnia and also suffered a minor stroke, believed to have been brought on by the stress of what happened.

She said the family had to leave their home, leading to her daughter receiving a call in which she was threatened with having her face cut off, and relatives having their throat slit and being decapitated.

As a two-day sentencing hearing got underway, referring to a statement written by one of the victims herself, prosecutor Noel Lucas QC told the court: ‘She has suffered psychological issues.

‘She has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and aggressive bouts of anxiety and depression as a result. She mentions that although she has managed to have a successful job and make a life for herself, she has missed out on a vital part of her education.

‘Her self-confidence as a result of the abuse is next to none. She struggles with trust and with romantic relationships. Physical affection is something of which she is wary.’

Sickening: Another two brothers, Akhtar Dogar (left), 32, and Anjum Dogar (right), 31, were also convicted at the Old Bailey of charges including rape, trafficking and organising prostitution

Reading directly from the victim impact 
statement, Mr Lucas said: ‘It's hard for my family when I go through 
depressive stages because I'm prone to self-harm.’

Another mother said of her now grown-up daughter: ‘I think the damage done to her by these men is irrevocable.’

'Her self-confidence as a result of the abuse is next to none. She struggles with trust and with romantic relationships. Physical affection is something of which she is wary'

The statements also referred to the failures of local authorities in dealing with what was going on, and how some of the parents themselves were blamed before the truth was uncovered.

One father said: ‘If these men hadn't been doing such vile things to my daughter then we wouldn't have had to deal with social services, children's homes or police. I don't want any other parent to feel as impotent as we were.’

He added that the abuse had had a ‘devastating effect on me and my family’.

The man's wife also made a statement in which she said of their daughter: ‘She went from a loving, sweet young child to a sullen, frightened and evasive child.

Facing jail: Kamar Jamil (left), 27, and Assad Hussain (right) , 32, were also found guilty after the five-month trial

‘She went to being frustrated and 
aggressive towards me if I tried to reach out to her. I guess that was 
her way of trying to deal with what was happening to her.

Convicted: Zeeshan Ahmed, 28, was found guilty of charges involving the abuse of underage girls

‘She was protecting me from the truth and horror of what she was being subjected to. They took my daughter's teenage years, which I'm sure seems obvious, but those teenage years were taken from me too.’

She also referred to the failure of the police and social services in finding out what was happening and protecting the girls, writing that they were made to feel like they were ‘over-reacting’.

‘I can recall countless incidents when I have been upset and frustrated by various professional bodies,’ she said.

Six of the defendants listened from the dock as Mr Lucas outlined some of the victim impact statements, but the court heard that Mohammed Karrar, 38, had refused to come up from the cells.

He was convicted last month with his brother, Bassam Karrar, 34, and another two brothers, Akhtar Dogar, 32, and Anjum Dogar, 31, of charges including rape, trafficking and organising prostitution.

Kamar Jamil, 27, Assad Hussain, 32, and Zeeshan Ahmed, 28, were also found guilty following the five-month trial during which the jury was told the gang sexually exploited girls as young as 11.
