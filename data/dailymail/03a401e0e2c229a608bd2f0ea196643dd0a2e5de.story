Ronald Phillips is a death row inmate who raped and killed a three-year-old girl

Just 72 hours out from his long-awaited death sentence, condemned child killer Ronald Phillips has failed in his bid to donate organs to his ailing mother and sister.

The death row inmate had maintained through attorneys that the request was not a delay tactic but a final gesture of good.

While prison officials scrambled to review Phillips' last-minute request, which they called 'unprecedented', ultimately they could not figure out a way to get the 40-year-old to and from an offsite hospital while following security procedures leading up to an execution.

Phillips is scheduled to die Thursday by an injection of a sedative and painkiller that has never been used in a U.S. execution.

Phillips' mother has kidney disease and is on dialysis and his sister has a heart condition.

The department says it will be up to his family whether the organs are donated after his death.

However it is unclear whether they would be viable once Phillips' body is eventually turned over to his family.

The prisons department 'has reviewed the options and has determined that the department is not equipped to facilitate organ donation pre- or post- execution,' said spokeswoman JoEllen Smith.

Transporting an inmate so close to his execution date outside prison walls for an off-site medical procedure would pose 'significant security concerns and risks,' Stephen C. Gray, general counsel of prison risk management, wrote in a Tuesday reply to Phillips' request.

Phillips had never requested to donate his organs earlier, although the option is available under prison medical policy, Gray wrote.

Phillips was sentenced to death for raping and killing his girlfriend's daughter, three-year-old Sheila Marie Evans (pictured), in Akron in 1993

Phillips will be injected with a never-been-used combination of midazolam, a sedative, and hydromorphone, a painkiller. He has been languishing on death row for 20 years

Phillips was sentenced to die for the rape and death of his girlfriend's three-year-old daughter in Akron in 1993.

Ohio Gov. John Kasich last week rejected Phillips' request for mercy, and all his appeals have been dropped.

Phillips' Cleveland attorney, Tim Sweeney, said that Phillips did not propose donating his organs earlier because he was hopeful his case would go another way.

'He's been very reflective and prayerful over the last several weeks,' he said.

'I think he was very hopeful that he was going to be granted clemency and/or get relief from the court, so this never really had to come to a head.

'The disappointment on those fronts made this obviously more relevant.'

His mother has kidney disease and is on dialysis and his sister has a heart condition, the Monday letter said.

Sheila Marie Evans was murdered in her home on January 18, 1993.

Phillips had been sexually and physically abusing her for some time.

He was 19 at the time

Phillips severely beat Sheila in the head, face and abdomen, threw her against walls and dragged her by the hair.

He also anally raped her.

Phillips later confessed the crime to police.

In October, the Ohio Parole Board rejected a claim that Phillips was sexually, physically and verbally abused by his father during childhood, with no judge or court hearing such matters in the 20-year history of the case.

In 1995, Delaware death row inmate Steven Shelton was allowed to donate a kidney to his mother while in prison, though he was not facing imminent execution.

Following successful appeals, his death sentence was reversed and he was re-sentenced to prison time in 2011.
