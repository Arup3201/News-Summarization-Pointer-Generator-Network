A Boeing Dreamliner has been forced to make an emergency landing after experiencing a mechanical problem - the second such incident for the company in a week.

The United Airlines flight bound for Denver was diverted back to its take-off point in Houston three hours into its journey on Sunday morning due to an issue with the brake indicator.

It comes just days after a Dreamliner was forced to make an emergency landing in Seattle shortly after taking off from Denver for Tokyo last Tuesday.

The issues will heap further 
embarrassment on Boeing, which has seen the Dreamliner get off to a 
troubled start by being grounded for several months thanks to 
overheating in its battery.

Following the latest incident, the company said in a statement: 'United flight 94 from Houston to Denver
returned to Houston Sunday due to a brake indicator issue.

'Following standard operating procedures, as a precautionary measure, 
the flight landed in emergency status. The aircraft landed safely at 
11:58 a.m. C.T. and our maintenance team is conducting a review of the 
aircraft.'

The flight turned around after nearing Oklahoma. There were no passenger injuries and all were placed on other flights.

'The 787 is a great airplane and we know it will continue to receive heightened attention when reliability events occur in service,' Boeing spokeswoman Yvonne Leach said Sunday.

Last week's incident was connected to a problem with an oil filter. The flight safely landed at Seattle airport with no further incidents.

Boeing
said in a statement that it was working with United and General 
Electric, manufacturer of the plane's jet engines, to work out what had 
gone wrong.

The 787 Dreamliner, the first carbon-fiber aircraft made by Boeing, was hotly anticipated in the 
aircraft industry, but its development has been plagued with troubles.

The jet was launched three years behind schedule, and was first delivered to airlines in 2011.

However,
in January this year the entire fleet of Dreamliners worldwide was 
grounded after two planes were forced to make emergency landings within 
the space of a week.

The problem was traced to the jets' lithium-ion batteries, which were only declared safe last month.

The latest emergency landing will cast more doubt on the future of the 787, which faces stiff competition from the forthcoming Airbus A350.

Nonetheless, airlines such as British Airways and Thomson Airlines have bought the planes in an attempt to reduce the cost of fuel.
