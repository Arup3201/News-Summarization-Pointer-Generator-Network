A team of scientists have recreated a supernova in a laboratory.

Using laser beams 60,000 billion times more powerful than a laser pointer, the Oxford University team made scaled supernova explosions on a table-top.

They say this could be used to study supernova explosions in the laboratory, instead of observing them in space.

Oxford University scientists have recreated a supernova in a laboratory. Shown here is their experiment; a carbon rod (centre) is being heated by lasers coming in from the left, causing an explosion that expands a shockwave into surrounding argon gas, mimicking a star's expansion into the interstellar medium

Supernova explosions, triggered when the fuel within a star reignites or its core collapses, launch a detonation shock wave that sweeps through a few light years of space from the exploding star in just a few hundred years.

Type Ia: A white dwarf accumulates material from a stellar companion until it undergoes runaway nuclear fusion and explodes.

Non-standard type 1a: Two white dwarfs merge until their combined mass causes an explosion.

Type II:
 A star at least nine times the mass of the sun eventually experiences a
 core collapse as its fuel runs out, causing it to explode.

Type 1b and 1c: A star undergoes core collapse but most of its outer hydrogen has already been lost to stellar winds.

Hypernova: Extreme
 type of supernova, 50 times as energetic as other supernovas, resulting
 in a black hole. The exact cause of them is unknown.

They are the among the most energetic events in the universe.

But not all such explosions are alike and some, such as Cassiopeia A, show puzzling irregular shapes made of knots and twists.

To investigate what may cause these peculiar shapes the international team led by Oxford University scientists devised a method to study the explosions in the laboratory.

To 
recreate a supernova explosion in the laboratory the team used the 
Vulcan laser facility at the UK's Science and Technology Facilities 
Council's Rutherford Appleton Lab.

'Our
 team began by focusing three laser beams onto a carbon rod target, not 
much thicker than a strand of hair, in a low density gas-filled 
chamber,' says Jena Meinecke, an Oxford University graduate student, 
who headed the experimental efforts.

The
 enormous amount of heat generatedÂ  by the laser - more than a few million degrees Celsius - caused the rod to explode, creating a blast that 
expanded out through the low density gas.

In
 the experiments, the dense gas clumps or gas clouds that surround an 
exploding star were simulated by introducing a plastic grid to disturb 
the shock front.

'The
 experiment demonstrated that as the blast of the explosion passes 
through the grid it becomes irregular and turbulent just like the images
 from Cassiopeia,' says Professor Gianluca Gregori of Oxford University's Department of Physics, who led the study published in Nature Physics.

The results confirmed that supernovas do not always expand uniformly into interstellar material such as dust and gas.

Cassiopeia A, a false colour image shown here using observations from the Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes, is a supernova remnant found 11,000 light years from Earth in the Milky Way. It's odd shape is likely due to interactions between the initial explosion, 300 years ago, and the surrounding interstellar medium

Pictured are the team of researchers who performed the experiment, shown back in 2012 at STFC's (Science and Technology Facilties Council) Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. To perform their latest experiment the team Vulcan laser at the Central Laser Facility, a high-power laser system

'It may sound surprising that a table-top laboratory experiment that fits inside an average room can be used to study astrophysical objects that are light years across,' says Professor Gregori.

'In reality, the laws of physics are the same everywhere, and physical processes can be scaled from one to the other in the same way that waves in a bucket are comparable to waves in the ocean.

'So our experiments can complement observations of events such as the Cassiopeia A supernova explosion.'

The Cassiopeia A supernova explosion was first spotted about 300 years ago in the Cassiopeia constellation 11,000 light years away.

The optical images of the explosion reveal irregular 'knotty' features and associated with these are intense radio and X-ray emissions.

Whilst no one is sure what creates these phenomena one possibility is that the blast passes through a region of space that is filled with dense clumps or clouds of gas.

Supernovas (artist's illustration shown) are among the most energetic events in the universe but we still know very little about them. It is often said that a star going supernova releases more energy in the explosion than our sun will in its entire 10 billion-year lifetime

Jena Meinecke from Oxford University was the lead author on the paper. Here she is shown using Central Laser Facilities' (CLF) Vulcan laser to investigate the turbulent flow of inter-colliding plasmas in an ambient background, a separate Laboratory-based astrophysics experiment, in May 2012

One further puzzle of supernovas is their interaction with magnetic fields.

Magnetic fields are known to influence the generation of radiation during a supernova explosion.

But how magnetic fields came to be found everywhere in the universe is a mystery.

'Magnetic fields are ubiquitous in the universe,' says Dr Donald Lamb, from the University of Chicago.

'We're pretty sure that the fields didn't exist at the beginning, at the Big Bang.

'So there's this fundamental question: how did magnetic fields arise?'

The results of this experiment are significant, say the team, because they help to piece together a story for the creation and development of magnetic fields in our universe.

A team from Oxford University have recreated a supernova explosion

The experiment was performed with the UK's Vulcan laser facility

@highlight

They heated a rod to millions of degrees by focusing 3 laser beams on it

The rod then exploded into a surrounding gas, mimicking the interaction between a star going supernova and the interstellar medium

@highlight

Results prove that supernovas do not expand uniformly as once thought

Could also solve the mystery of how magnetic fields formed in the universe
