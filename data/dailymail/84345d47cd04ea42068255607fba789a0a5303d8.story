As nasty as the polar vortex was, it made for some spectacular sights.

One of the best was the hundreds of beach ball-sized ice boulders that washed up on the shores of Lake Michigan.Â 

The incredible winter phenomenon, which was captured by many YouTube videos, takes place when the water temperature falls to just below freezing.

Wow: Hundreds of beach ball-sized ice boulders washed up on the shores of Lake Michigan this week

According to park ranger Annie Lipscomb, the balls, weighing up to 75 pounds, form when chunks of ice break off the large sheets of ice on the lake.

The motion of the waves then smooth and round the edges of the ice, molding it into spheres similar to how stones are shaped, Lipscomb added to mlive.com.

AccuWeather.com Meteorologist Jim Andrews added: 'It's possible that the ice is accreting like a snowball or like a hailstone, and that they keep growing.'

The wind pushes the boulders to the shore and they don't sink because solid ice is less dense than liquid water.

The result somewhat resembles a giant bowl of Cocoa Puffs along the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore and has drawn the attention of photographers and tourists alike.

And while the process does require extremely chilly conditions, it's definitely not the first time such ice balls have appeared, Andrews said.

Suttons Bay photographer Ken Scott knows this well. He told mlive.com that he was seen the boulders appear periodically for years, and loves to brave the wintry weather to capture them.

This year was no different. He pulled on his warmest wear and hiked a half-mile from the road to where he had a good view.

Unsurprisingly, he had the whole shore to himself following the storms brought on by the polar vortex.

'That's when some of the best shows are,' he said.

The recent cold spell was caused by a polar vortex descending from the Arctic

America has finally begun to warm up after being in the icy grip of the polar vortex. But the chilling news doesn't stop, because it's estimated that the extreme cold weather has cost the U.S economy about $5billion.

It brought about the biggest economic disruption delivered by the weather since Superstorm Sandy in 2012, said Evan Gold, senior vice president at Planalytics, a business weather intelligence company in suburban Philadelphia.

While the impact came nowhere close to Sandy, which caused an estimated $65 billion in property damage alone, the deep freeze's impact came from its breadth.

'There's a lot of economic activity that didn't happen,' Gold said. 'Some of that will be made up but some of it just gets lost.'

Still, Gold noted his $5 billion estimate pales in comparison with an annual gross domestic product of about $15 trillion - working out to maybe one-seventh to one-eighth of one day's production for the entire country.

'It's a small fraction of a percent, but it's still an impact,' Gold said.

According to the weather database, America is experiencing far fewer extreme cold spells than it used to.

An Associated Press analysis of daily national winter temperature - averaged into one figure for the Lower 48 states - shows that since 1900 cold extremes like this week's happen about once every four years. Until recently.

Government meteorologist Greg Carbin created a database of the winter daily national temperature average going back to 1900. And Monday was the first time since 1979 that the national average temperature dropped below 18 degrees.

In 27 distinct cold snaps over 115 years, that's by far the longest the U.S. has gone without getting this frigid.
