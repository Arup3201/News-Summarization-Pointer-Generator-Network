Democracy should keep pace with the 'way we live our lives', Jenny Watson, the head of the Electoral Commission said

Britain must move to online voting because more of us are doing the weekly grocery shop via the internet, the UK’s elections watchdog has said.

Democracy should keep pace with the ‘way we live our lives’, Jenny Watson, the head of the Electoral Commission said.

The ‘Ocado’ generation and young people in particular were switched off by the old-fashioned system.

‘Technology has changed rapidly in the last decade. Unless our electoral system keeps pace with the way many voters live the rest of their lives - where the way they bank and the way they shop has been transformed - it risks being seen as increasingly alien and outdated,’ she said.

She warned that just 56 per cent of 19 to 24 year olds were registered to vote, compared to 94 per cent of those aged 65 or older.

As technology advanced, e-voting was ‘not an issue that can stay on the slow track any longer’. Steps had to be taken to ‘drag’ the electoral ‘system into the 21st Century’, she said.

Miss Watson admitted that e-voting was ‘radical’ but dismissed any comparison with voting in X-Factor style reality TV shows.

‘Before anyone accuses us of simply equating the act of voting in an election with shopping online - or indeed with voting in the X Factor - let me be clear. Voting is a serious and important civic act - citizens’ chance to change the people in power.’

A balance had to be struck between increasing voter turnout and cutting fraud, she said.

The Electoral Commission is also exploring other ‘modernising’ ideas including allowing those who forget to register to sign up on polling and cast their vote.

From June, the Electoral Commission will start to move people individually onto an automatic electoral roll.

This would end the ‘19th Century concept’ that a ‘head of the household’ is responsible for registering everyone.

The move comes amid evidence of electoral fraud - particularly in Labour strongholds - where ‘phantom’ and unwitting voters were signed up for postal votes.

While some experts feared that large numbers would fall off the electoral roll under the new individual voter registration system, the Electoral Commission said it was using data matching with the Department for Work and Pensions to make the system more secure.

Millions will be transferred onto the electoral roll, after their National Insurance number is verified.

Miss Watson said many voters were ‘baffled’ that they could not sign up to the electoral register online. They could print off forms from the internet but these still need to be put in the post.

The most high profile country to use electronic voting for its general election is Estonia. But to stamp out fraud, voters have to use biometric identity cards - which the British government and privacy campaigners vehemently oppose.
