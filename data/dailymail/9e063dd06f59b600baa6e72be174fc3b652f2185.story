The top-ten beer-drinking states in the United States has been revealed - with New Hampshire top of the beer-guzzlers.

More than six billion gallons of the golden nectar were sold across all the states in 2011, but there is a huge contrast between each states, with some states, such as Connecticut, seeing as little as 21.8 gallons drank per person in 2011.

Meanwhile, in New Hampshire, North Dakota and Montana, more than 40 gallons are drunk per person.

For anyone worried that the nation may be drowning in inebriation, they can rest assured that overall consumption is down, with figures from The Beer Institute showing that Americans are drinking an average of 7.5 per cent less beer since 2003.

Beer Nation: 43 gallons of beer was consumed in New Hampshire for each resident of the state, while Connecticut was the most sober with just 23 gallons per resident

Beer-drinking has fallen for the last three years in the U.S. - although it has increased in some states - for instance, it actually increased in Vermont by seven per cent over the last three years.

The Beer Institute monitors the sales of beer in each state, and then the publication 24/7 Wall Street extrapolated the average beer intake per person based on population figures.

There are some caveats - the figures are based on the number of people living in each state aged over 21.

But it does not necessarily take into account each state's unique properties - for instance, New Hampshire's alcohol taxes are about five or six per cent lower than their nearest neighbours.

So it is not uncommon for residents from Massachusetts, Vermont, and Maine to cross over the borders to pick up their alcohol intake - inflating New Hampshire's ratings.

Other quirks in local legislation also play a role - there are still states which do not allow alcohol sales on a Sunday.

Meanwhile, all the states in the Top 10 allow alcohol sales in gas stations and convenience stores, again making casual purchases or purchases from out-of-state visitors easier.

However there does seem to be a correlation between high amounts of beer purchased and the rates of beer drinking.

A separate 2011 survey studied beer drinking across the entire U.S., and 24/7 reports that the ten states with the highest number of beer sales were among the top states for binge drinking.

Around 18 per cent of New Hampshire residents were classed as binge-drinkers - making them 21st on the list of binge-drinking states.

Meanwhile, the second on the list, North Dakota, saw nearly 24 per cent of their residents admit to drinking too much at times.

Nebraskans were among the heaviest drinkers in the United States, with nearly 23 per cent classed as binge drinkers, and another 7.5 per cent classed as heavy drinkers.

Nearly 62 per cent of adults in the state stated they had consumed alcohol within the past 30 days - one of the highest percentages in the country.

by over 7% - more than any other state in the country.

Hampshire's 'victory' may well be skewed due to Vermont and 
Massachusetts residents crossing state lines to purchase alcohol.
