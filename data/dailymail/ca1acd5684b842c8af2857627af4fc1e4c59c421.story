Jordan Henderson has claimed Adam Lallana will be an important player for Liverpool this season.

The midfielder, who moved to Anfield from Southampton in £20million deal during the summer, scored his first Liverpool goal on Saturday as the Reds defeated West Brom 2-1.

Henderson believes his fellow England international was brilliant as Liverpool won their first Barclays Premier League game since the club's 3-0 victory over Tottenham at the end of August.

'Adam has been brilliant for a number of weeks now. He is getting his fitness back from that long injury spell he had out. He will be a big player for us this season so hopefully he will keep doing that,' Henderson told the Daily Mirror.

'He gets us on the front foot well. You can fizz it into him and he will always take his touch forward, gets in behind their midfield and drives us on, which is very important.

'He is looking sharp. He did well with a bit of skill coming inside, I just showed myself for the bounce pass and it was a great finish. I thought he was brilliant all day.'
