Everton striker Samuel Eto’o is so famous even his team-mates were a little bit starstruck when he first arrived at Goodison Park.

Eto’o, 33, has only made two substitutes appearances ahead of Sunday's clash with Crystal Palace but it hasn’t stopped the former Real Madrid, Barcelona, Inter Milan and Chelsea superstar making his mark.

‘I must say when he first signed and came into training, it was a bit “That’s Samuel Eto’o there!” admitted forward Steven Naismith.

The Everton striker will be hoping to get on the scoresheet against Crystal Palace on Sunday

‘He’s won a fair few things in his career, it’s surreal when you list them all. People questioned him after not playing as much at Chelsea last season but he still scored a fair amount of goals for the amount of game time he had.

‘In the short time he has been here, he has shown his class. He knows how to play the lone striker role or how to play with a striker. 

'He is a presence who knows when to wait for runners as you saw with his assist for Kevin Mirallas on Thursday night. He is a fantastic signing for us and a massive asset.’

The Cameroon striker won two Champions League crowns and three La Liga titles with Barca before landing the Treble for Jose Mourinho’s Inter Milan in 2010. He will also prove his worth with Everton who are now in a run of seven matches in three weeks.

Naismith added: ‘That is where the boys that aren’t playing still need to work hard as they are still going to be used.’
