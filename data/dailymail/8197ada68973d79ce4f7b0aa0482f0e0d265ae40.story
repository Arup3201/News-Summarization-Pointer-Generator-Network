A San Francisco firefighter has filed a legal claim alleging fire officials falsely identified her to the media as the person responsible for killing a 16-year-old survivor of the Asiana Airlines crash, a newspaper reported.

Fire officials wanted to protect the firefighter who first ran over Ye Meng Yuan and was responsible for her death, according to Elyse Duckett's claim.

Footage shows Duckett's rig was the second to roll over Meng Yuan, who was covered in fire foam at the time, the newspaper reported.

Elyse Duckett: The firefighter is alleging defamation in the Asiana crash as being falsely identified as the one who ran over a Chinese teenage girl that died in the accident

Pinning the blame: Duckett¿s claim says Fire Chief Joanne Hayes-White and other department brass told her 'that she needed to admit to the incident and take responsibility' for Ye¿s death

A dashboard camera aboard a San Francisco Fire Department rig shows crash victim Ye Meng Yuan, in the foreground and partially obscured by foam. The rig ran over Miss Yuan seconds later

The girl was one of three Chinese teens who died in the July 6 crash; 
one died during the crash, and another died later in the hospital.

Video from a camera mounted on a San 
Francisco firetruck shows at least two emergency workers alerting 
vehicles to go around Chinese student Ye Meng Yuan as she lay on the 
ground by the stricken aircraft. The first responders believed she was 
dead and did not check her vital signs.

One
 lieutenant told crash investigators that she made 'a three second' 
visual assessment of Miss Yuan and automatically assumed 'that's our 
first casualty' - without putting a finger to her pulse or checking if 
she was still breathing.

Less
 than 15 minutes after the first driver had seen Miss Yuan, they drove 
over the teen who was now covered in the foam being used to douse the 
burning plane. Moments later, a second fire truck rode over the 
student's body.

The video
 does not show the trucks running her over but the original footage is 
in the possession of the distraught teenage girl's family and legal team
 in China.

The official
 line from the San Francisco Fire Department is that the girl was 
accidentally struck by trucks racing to battle the fiery wreck of the 
Asiana Airlines Boeing 777 because she was hidden by foam sprayed over 
the plane.

Duckett is accusing the department of discrimination and defamation and seeking $300,000 in damages.

Such claims are generally precursors to lawsuits.

City and fire officials didn't immediately respond to messages left early Tuesday by The Associated Press.

They
 declined comment to the Chronicle, although fire spokeswoman Mindy 
Talmadge told the newspaper the fire chief and department 'remain very 
supportive of all the first responders who responded to the Asiana 
incident and are proud of their commendable efforts.'

Best
 of friend: Ye Meng Yuan and Yuan Linjia, both 16, died when the Boeing 
777 passenger jet slammed into a seawall while attempting to land

Duckett
 said fire officials insisted she was responsible for Meng Yuan's death 
even though she told them there was video showing another vehicle had 
hit the girl.

She 
later got a call from KGO-TV, which then ran a story identifying her as 
the person who had run over and killed Meng Yuan, according to her 
attorney, Eduardo Roy, and the claim.

It's still unknown how Meng Yuan got out of the plane before she was run over twice.

An autopsy revealed Miss Yuan was alive before two fire vehicles hit her.

Yuan was one of three people to die as 
the plane misjudged its landing at San Francisco on July 6 and struck 
its tail section on a sea wall as it came into land - 304 people 
survived.

In an obituary, the teenager was 
described as a champion athlete who excelled at literature, playing 
piano, singing and public speaking. Her given name means 'wish come 
true' in Chinese.
