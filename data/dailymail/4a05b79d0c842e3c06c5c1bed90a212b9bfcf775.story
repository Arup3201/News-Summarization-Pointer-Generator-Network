Dr Christian Jessen, presenter of Channel 4's Weighing Up The Enemy explores whether more obese people should be offered weight loss surgery

More obese people should be given gastric bands on the NHS to save the health service millions in the future, a doctor has said. 

One in four adults and one in five children in the UK are obese.

Countless studies have found carrying extra weight puts a person at significantly greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes, suffering heart problems, cancer and stroke.

Experts estimate treating obesity and the associated health problems costs the NHS around £6 billion every year.

Last year 8,000 overweight patients were given weight loss surgery on the NHS.

But that is less than one per cent of those people who could benefit, experts say.

Dr Christian Jessen, presenter of Channel 4's Weighing Up The Enemy, will tomorrow explore the question of whether it makes economic sense to offer gastric bands, and bypass operations to more obese people.

He argues that rather than lumbering the taxpayer with a hefty bill, the surgery could in fact save the NHS millions in the future.

The NHS Choices website reveals gastric band operations cost between £5,000 and £8,000 at private clinics.

And gastric bypass surgery costs the NHS between £9,500 to £15,000.

The Channel 4 show follows patient Paula's journey as she is admitted to Birmingham's Heartlands Hospital for a gastric band operation.

The 62-year-old weighs more than 21 stone and relies on carers to help her go about her day-to-day life. 

Speaking to the experts caring for Paula, Dr Jessen questions whether the operation makes financial sense for the NHS.

Dietitian Sally Abbot said: 'The savings in medications alone would surely outweigh the cost of bariatric surgery.

'And it's not even that, if you think of the social care side as well, Paula has carers, but if she's able to be more independent in everyday life, that's a saving in itself.'

But bariatric surgery is not without risks. Complications include internal bleeding, respiratory problems and post-operative infections.

Weight loss surgeon Paul Super, who works at Birmingham's Heartlands Hospital, said despite those risks, the financial benefits of bariatric surgery would be seen to the NHS within a year for many patients.

'Bariatric surgery is high risk because of the nature of the surgery, in and around the top of the stomach, its a a very tricky area to operate,' he said.

'This operation will cost the taxpayer around £5,000 all in.

With gastric band and bypass operations costing the taxpayer around £5,000 some experts have argued it would save the NHS money in the long term, with obesity related illnesses, such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease and cancer costing around £6 billion each year in the UK (file picture)

Weight loss surgery, also known as bariatric surgery, is currently used as a last resort to treat people who are dangerously obese.

It is only permitted on the NHS in cases where an obese patient has made lifestyle changes but failed.

Being dangerously obese, means a person's life is at risk.

It is defined as having a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or above.

Having a BMI of 35 or above and having another serious health condition, which could be improved by losing weight, such as type 2 diabetes, is also considered a dangerous level of obesity.

The National Institue for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) is currently considering whether to lower the threshold for weight loss surgery to a BMI of more than 30 for those recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.

The two most widely used types of weight loss surgery are gastric band operations and gastric bypass procedures.

Gastric bands work to reduce the size of the stomach, meaning a smaller amount of food is needed to make a person feel full.

Gastric bypasses are where the digestive system is re-routed past the majority of a person's stomach. It means a person digests less food, and it takes much less food to satisfy hunger pangs.

Weight loss surgery can achieve impressive results but is not a magic cure for obesity.

Patients have to stick to a rigorous, life-long plan, including a carefully controlled diet and regular exercise, to avoid gaining weight.

'If her costs are £15,000 it will pay for itself before the year is up.

'We wouldn't be wasting taxpayers money doing this operation if it wasn't worth it and didn't work out cost effective in the end.'

Another gastric band patient Lorna, who weighed 25 stone at her heaviest, told Dr Jessen the surgery has changed her life.

'Outside of having children it is definitely the best thing I have ever done,' she said. 'It has been life-changing.

'Basically I couldn't walk very far, I was diabetic, had IBS and mild sleep apnoea, but they have all cleared up now. I am very happy.'

Dr Jessen said: 'Bariatric surgery is certainly not an easy option but where it is simple is in the economics.

'It is very clear to me we need to invest more now in this type of procedure in order to save considerable amounts in the future.'  

Tam Fry, spokesman for the National Obesity Forum, agreed that more obese people should be offered weight loss surgery.

'Bariatric surgery, for a long time seen by the populus at large as a very expensive, wasteful NHS treatment, actually should be seen as a good investment for the future,' he told MailOnline.

'The reason being simply cutting the stomach of obese people in half, reducing it to normal size, means an individual is much less likely to acquire diabetes, cardiovascular problems.

'They require far more expensive treatment for longer.

'The literature says within two to three years, bariatric surgery pays for itself.'

But he said, the problem lies with the way NHS budgets are worked out, accusing accountants for not seeing the potential of the bigger picture.

Dr Jessen, said: 'Bariatric surgery is certainly not an easy option but where it is simple is in the economics. It is very clear to me we need to invest more now in this type of procedure in order to save considerable amounts in the future'

'The real problem is that as far as the NHS is concerned the people who pay for these operations are not necessarily the same people who reap the financial rewards,' he said.

'There should be a budget for bariatric surgery, the benefits of which would spread to other budgets later in life.

'The big picture is that this surgery is well worth it for the NHS, there are no two ways about it.' 

But weight loss expert, Steve Miller, presenter of Sky's Fat Families, disagreed.

He said the money could be 'better spent on cancer care and terminal illness'. 

Mr Miller told MailOnline that people who need to lose weight can do something of their own accord.

'If we go down this path we will be paying for cosmetic surgery for people claiming their face is too saggy and it's causing depression,' he said.

'We need to motivate our nation to own their body.

'Motivation is not just about carrot, it is about stick. We require stronger warning measures, penalties for not managing weight, and as a society we need to discuss other options to help reduce weight loss, such as hypnosis. 

'We don't have the money in the bank to pay for such surgery. The NHS is struggling and we cannot be promoting the message "don't worry if you get too fat, we will give you free surgery".' 

Weighing Up The Enemy is on Channel 4 at 8pm tomorrow.
