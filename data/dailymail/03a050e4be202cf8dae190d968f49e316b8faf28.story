For a typical young sportsman, returning from a lengthy injury lay off to be thrown into back-to-back European ties before a date with the All Blacks might be a daunting prospect. But Owen Farrell is not a typical young sportsman.

Barely six years after becoming the youngest Englishman to play professional rugby union aged 17 years and 11 days — a mantle since taken by his fly-half rival George Ford — Farrell has won 25 England caps and scored 271 international points.

Assuming he passes muster against Clermont this Saturday and Munster next Friday, Farrell looks set to start at fly-half against the world champions at Twickenham on November 8. Last week Jonny Wilkinson called for the 23-year-old to be England’s first-choice No 10 during next year’s World Cup.

‘I’m not worried about anything,’ said Farrell, who has not played since injuring his quad against London Irish in Saracens’ third game — and his only start — of the season.

‘I’m looking forward to getting back out and playing. I feel ready to go.’

The indications at Saracens’ training ground on Tuesday were that Farrell will start on the bench at Allianz Park. Veteran Charlie Hodgson is expected to continue at No 10 before handing over to Farrell against Munster at Thomond Park.

Mark McCall, Saracens’ director of rugby, said: ‘Owen looks really sharp. We probably could have played him a fortnight ago because he was running well, which is why he’s so frustrated. We’ve been conservative with him.

‘I think in the long term for us and for England it’s been a break that Owen probably required. He’s played a lot of rugby at a very young age. He’s 23. Every question he’s been asked he’s answered. I think the world is his oyster.’

Farrell, who suffered a knee injury that ruled him out of last summer’s third Test against the All Blacks before his latest setback, has been spending his time on the sidelines studying opposition teams and England rivals.

‘The fact you don’t play doesn’t mean you don’t learn,’ he said. ‘I’ve watched more rugby over the last three weeks than I’ve ever watched.

‘I’ve watched a lot of Clermont already.’

Saturday’s clash will see a repeat of last season’s European semi-final, which Saracens won with one of the most breathtaking displays ever produced by an English club.

‘I’ve watched it back a few times this week and two things stood out to me. Our game was joined up: set pieces, kicking game, defence, attack, counter attack were all as one.

‘Coupled with that was the energy we brought. We’ll need to be like that again this week.’

 Three Wales stars, Jamie Roberts, Mike Phillips and Dan Lydiate, could quit Racing Metro and return home.

Racing coach Laurent Labit told French newspaper L’Equipe: ‘We have raised the subject with them. They have never really been that effective.’ Wales coach Warren Gatland has denied that the Welsh Rugby Union had ‘instigated contact’ with the players. Centre Roberts and flanker Lydiate joined Racing before the 2013-14 season and scrum-half Phillips moved there in December 2013 after being dismissed by Bayonne.

Any move could collapse if they play for Racing in the European Rugby Cup against Northampton on Saturday and are cup-tied.
