A family is grieving the sudden death of a 13-year-old girl who died on the way to school Tuesday morning when a van driven by her brother was struck by a large semi truck.

Katrina Maetzold, of Milaca, MN., was killed when a semi-truck broadsided the family van being driven by brother Tristan, 17. Siblings Patience, 16, and Devon, 11, were injured in the wreck but survived.

Neither of the four siblings was wearing a seat belt, officials told local media, and two were ejected from the vehicle.

The minivan was struck by the big rig as it attempted to make a left-hand turn, officials said. The accident occurred only a mile from school.

Tristan suffered a broken leg and Devon fractured his skull, the distraught father told WCCO. Sister Patience escaped with only bumps and bruises.

The truck driver suffered no injuries in the wreck and will not face any criminal charges, authorities said.

Grieving father Larry Maetzold told WCCO that his son had just gotten his license and that ‘he’s a good driver.’ Tristan Maetzold often drove his siblings to school, he explained.

Katrina Maetzold was sitting behind the driver’s seat without wearing a seat belt when she was catapulted from the van on impact, the Star Tribune reported. She died at the scene.

Younger brother Devon underwent four hours of brain surgery after the accident, he is expected to live, WCCO reported.

Katrina excelled as both an artist and a writer, her distraught father told WCCO.

‘She was the creative niche in my family, just had a wonderful way at looking at things, being able to see the beauty in things, being able to draw it,’ he added.

Despite the tragedy that has gripped the family, grandfather Lanny Maetzold said the outcome could have been three times worse, and that he hopes his son is able to see that.

‘He’s gonna blame himself and that’s not gonna change for a long time, and that’s my determinant goal to make sure he knows it’s not his fault,’ he explained.

Both men are still coming to grips with their loss, but also want to be with their children in this time of need.

Still, Larry Maetzold admitted this will not be easy to overcome.

‘I don’t know what I’m going to do without her… I’m all sorts of lost,’ he said. ‘I have no idea where to begin.’
