A California boy who was electrocuted at his birthday party is out of a medically induced coma and able to speak. 

Ten-year-old Elijah Belden's continued recovery was revealed in a Sunday post on a Facebook page run by his family, called 'Pray for Elijah Belden.'

Belden was awake and his eyes were open in an accompanying image posted by his family.

'Smiling so big we could all eat a banana sideways,' the post said. 'Praise the Lord. Elijah has been extubated tonight.

Injured: Elijah Belden suffered an electric shock after touching an electrified metal pole outside his family's home

'Words just can't express how happy mom and dad are that our son was able to tell us his name moments after the tube was removed. Thank you Jesus for answered prayer. Elijah and our family have definitely felt your prayers. Tomorrow we will not only be celebrating Elijah's 10th birthday but we will be truly celebrating his life. Continue to #prayforelijah7 as we hit the road to recovery.'

On Monday, a Facebook post provided further updates.

'As can be expected, he became very confused last night so in order to help him get rest he needed to begin his rehabilitation, he needed to be sedated,' it said. 'They say he now makes the 'calls' on slowly getting off the medications based on his reactions as they make small changes.

'Mom & Dad are so thankful the tube is out and for the small victories every day. They've been told many times life in the PICU is like a roller coaster and this is definitely proving to be true.'

Elijah's father Tony Belden earlier told The Press-Enterprise that Elijah had seemed to touch a metal post during the October 4 party near the pool and fell to the ground.

At the time of the electric shock, Elijah and another boy were taking a photo together, he told the newspaper. 

Nearby electric lights could have been responsible, the newspaper reported.  

Support: His family earlier shared this image on Facebook showing him in the hospital. Doctors found he has not suffered any damage to his brain of heart

Support: His mother Aly tried to help him but also suffered a shock while her husband heard their screams

His mother Aly Belden and his baseball coach were both shocked when they tried to help, Tony Belden told the newspaper, though they did not suffer injuries.

'She thought [Elijah] was dead,' Belden told The Press-Enterprise.

'I heard, "Elijah's down." Hearing that, I was so disconcerted... I couldn't even figure out how to dial 911.'

But his son was eventually taken to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he continues to receive treatment. 

The 'Pray for Elijah Belden' Facebook page currently has over 7,000 likes on Facebook.

Photos on the page show multiple well-wishers have worn ribbons for Belden with the number 7 - the number on his baseball jersey - and also pink socks as a way to raise awareness.
