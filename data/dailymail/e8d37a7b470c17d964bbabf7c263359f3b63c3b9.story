Goodyear has created a range of tyres (stock image) that monitor the pressure of tyres and automatically inflates them using just a regulator and a tube

Inflating your tyres too much can cause them to tear, while not having enough pressure can lead to punctures and damage to the suspension.

With this in mind, Goodyear has created tyres that monitor pressure, and automatically inflate using just a regulator and a tube.

If the regulator senses the pressure dropping it opens a valve to let air in, and this pumps up the tyre to the correct pounds per square inch (PSI).

All the components of the AMT system, including the pump, are contained within the tyre. 

Correctly inflated tyres can save fuel as well as lead to carbon dioxide reductions, while increasing the life of the tyre. 

Ohio-based Goodyear began developing the Air Maintenance Technology (AMT) in 2011 and will now start testing the tyres on trucking fleets in the US and Canada over the next 18 months.

‘This is an important milestone in the development of AMT for the commercial trucking marketplace,’ said Joseph Zekoski, Goodyear’s chief technical officer.

‘The tyres equipped with AMT have performed well in testing, and we are pleased that so many of our fleet customers were eager to collaborate with us in the next phase of testing.’

The system uses a so-called peristaltic pump technology to automatically maintain tyre pressure. 

This pressure is programmed in before the tyres are fitted, and is based on the individual car or truck’s PSI.

The system (illustrated) uses a so-called peristaltic pump technology to automatically maintain tyre pressure. An internal regulator senses when the pressure drops below the specified PSI, which then opens to allow air into the pumping tube. As the tyre rolls, it flattens the tube pushing air through the valve and into the tyre

As the tyre rolls, it flattens the tube pushing air through the valve and into the tyre cavity to inflate it to the optimised pressure.

The Department of Energy’s Office of Vehicle Technology has given $1.5 million to help research, develop and test the AMT system for commercial vehicle tyres.

According to Goodyear, tyre-related costs are the single largest maintenance item for commercial vehicle fleets.

Only 44 percent of all truck tyres are within five PSI of their target pressure, and 7 per cent are underinflated by 20 PSI or more.

‘The phase of [AMT] testing will go a long way in helping us determine when we can make this technology available in the commercial tyre marketplace,’ continued Mr Zekoski.

Earlier this month, the company also a long haul drive tyre in North America, called the Goodyear Fuelmax LHD G505D, designed to save fuel.
