Bayern Munich beat Wolfsburg 3-0 in the final of the Telekom Cup after dispensing with Borussia Monchengladbach in the semis.

Pep Guardiola's men strolled to victory in Hamburg. A brace from Robert Lewandowski came either side of a Sebastian Rode strike to give the German champions a comfortable victory.

The competition, which competes with the DFL-Supercup as the curtain-opener for the Bubndesliga season, has been running since 2009 and this was the first time Bayern Munich had lifted the trophy.

The German champions beat Monchengladbach on penalties in the semi-final while Wolfsburg had overcome Hamburg to set up today's final.

Unfortunately for Wolfsburg fans and neutrals alike, the match was essentially over by half time as Bayern dominated play and entered the break 2-0 up.

Guardiola made one change from the side that played yesterday as Danish youngster Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg replaced Rafinha.

The Telekom Cup holders won the Bundesliga by 19 points last season and with displays such as today's, few could argue that Guardiola's men are clear favourites to retain their title.

Many of their players may have returned from the World Cup slightly jaded, particularly those who returned as World Champions, but with the addition of Robert Lewandowski the Bavarians are a formidable prospect.

Their Spanish manager spoke of the pressure he felt to bring trophies to a club boasting an extensive collection of world-class players, but if today's performance was anything to go by, he is unlikely to disappoint.
