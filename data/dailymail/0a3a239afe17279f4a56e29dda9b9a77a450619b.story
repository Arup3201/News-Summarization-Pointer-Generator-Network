The future of the HS2 rail project was thrown into doubt last night after devastating evidence exposed the full extent of the environmental havoc that will be wreaked by the high-speed line.

Information obtained by The Mail on Sunday reveals HS2 will blight the lives of more than 500,000 unsuspecting people along a 40-mile-wide corridor through the heart of Middle England.

According to HS2’s own information, during the seven-year construction phase, huge convoys of trucks will rumble through dozens of peaceful towns and villages far from the line itself, bringing chaos and congestion in their wake.

The convoys could also put lives at risk, warn campaigners from the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) who forced HS2 bosses to disclose the bombshell information.

The report will fuel growing pressure on the Government to abandon the scheme.

Would HS2 be good for Britain?

David Cameron has said he 
is determined to go ahead with it, but faces mounting opposition from 
Tory MPs whose constituencies face being cut to shreds by the scheme.

But this newspaper has established that several Cabinet Ministers – including, crucially, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson – have doubts about HS2.

A well-placed source said: ‘Owen’s view is that he will subject it to such tough environmental tests that he will kill off the whole thing.’

The CPRE analysis – published in the form of maps available online from today – will reinforce those who agree with Mr Paterson. And the doubts have spread to senior figures in other parties.

Former Labour Trade Minister Peter Mandelson has questioned HS2’s viability, while UKIP leader Nigel Farage has been a long-term fierce critic of the scheme.

Until now, official consultation exercises on the estimated £50 billion project had suggested only those living closest to the proposed route would suffer any impact on their lives and the value of their homes.

But after weeks of requests from the CPRE, HS2 finally released a starkly different picture of the dramatic effects of the construction phase, which will last up to seven years, set to begin in 2017.

CPRE senior transport campaigner Ralph Smyth said: ‘It is not acceptable that it took a charity to uncover this and let up to half a million people know that they will be affected by this project.’

The CPRE’s inquiries revealed:

He said: ‘We asked HS2 for all the data on the construction and the scheme itself. The draft Environmental Statement was published on May 16 and that’s when we asked for the full data. 

‘I was chasing the data all the time and they just kept saying “it’s  coming by email” or “it’s in the post”.’ When The Mail on Sunday broke the news to MPs, councillors and residents in the affected communities, we were met with shock  at the scale of the impending invasion – and anger that no one had warned them.

South Northamptonshire Tory MP  Andrea Leadsom predicted an ‘appalling’ impact on her constituents from construction and called for compensation.

‘There’s no doubt that residents are devastated by the prospect of the noise, traffic and pollution in such beautiful and ancient countryside,’ she said.

‘The impact during construction is going to be appalling and will damage South Northamptonshire for ever. It is already leaving hundreds of home owners with permanent blight and misery, as well as huge financial loss.

Actor Geoffrey Palmer has thrown his weight behind the no campaign, pictured at a protest in Gt. Missenden, Bucks, which is in the path of the proposed route for the HS2 rail line

‘If this project goes ahead, there has to be generous compensation including a property bond to make sure people can move on with their lives,’ she added. 

‘Hearing about the prospective construction blight right across my constituency just adds to the need for hard and convincing evidence that HS2 will give taxpayers value for money versus other possible infrastructure projects.’

Experts at the Chilterns Conservation Board have calculated that the spoil from tunnelling in their area alone could result in 1.7 million lorry journeys, or a truck using local roads every 26 seconds every working day for five years.

In Princes Risborough, more than six miles from the line, residents had expected HS2 to leave them largely unaffected. But the CPRE has discovered the pretty market town, on the ancient Icknield Way path, will be effectively cut into three by the lorries’ routes.

Princes Risborough’s mayor and district councillor Alan Turner said: ‘People will be mortified. Our roads network is already in a shocking state through lack of investment, so having so many of these great big lorries will cause serious damage.

‘This will surely affect property prices – after all, once these trucks start rolling and prospective buyers see large numbers of these vehicles trundling through, it’s bound to deter people. Safety is also a huge concern – we already have around 16,000 vehicle movements a day through Risborough and only a few weeks back a young boy was knocked down on a zebra crossing and seriously injured.’

The film director behind the iconic James Bond title sequences expressed his horror at trucks coming through his home village of Caversfield, Oxfordshire.

Daniel Kleinman, 57, owns a  manor house which has the village’s stunning 12th Century church in its grounds. Mr Kleinman said he could scarcely believe he and neighbours hadn’t been told about the HS2 traffic and said: ‘I think it’s very underhand and unfair that small villages in rural places should be subjected to something like this for so many years without people being asked about it.

‘We already have a traffic problem here so I can only imagine this is going to make it a lot worse.’

In Charwelton, Northamptonshire, Mike Rowell, 56, a project manager for Jaguar Land Rover, said: ‘I knew absolutely nothing about this. Why is it not part of the public consultation process?

‘We need to be aware about this if it’s going to have a significant negative impact on our house prices.

‘We only moved here six months ago, to get away from it all. It’s a fantastic place –  you come here to forget about  everything. But if huge convoys  of lorries are going up and down 24/7, there’s going to be a hell of  a noise.’

In the tiny village of Wing, Bucks, Jane Clarke 67, shuddered at the prospect of more heavy lorries storming past her 16th Century cottage, which sits on a busy tight bend. The retired NHS administrator, whose home was built in 1556, said: ‘This road is already an absolute nightmare. The traffic is constant and never stops as  it is.

‘I don’t understand why they are wasting  so much money on a high-speed rail line when we need a bypass around the  village. To me, it’s a total  nonsense.

‘We have two schools in the village and I don’t think any one has thought about the safety aspect of having heavy goods vehicles coming through. It’s a recipe for disaster.’

In a statement, the CPRE said:  ‘HS2 was supposed to free up space on the railways to get lorries off  the roads.

Fierce critic: UKIP leader Nigel Farage is strongly opposed to HS2

‘But people in dozens of sleepy villages many miles from the route will be finding out today that it could mean the opposite for them.

‘The plans for building it would mean endless convoys of lorries  taking to their local roads, at best destroying their peace and quiet, at worst putting local people’s lives  in danger.

‘Less than ten per cent of the materials required to build HS1 were taken by road.

‘The Government seems not to want to try to beat the standard set by HS1 in terms of minimising HGV construction traffic on local roads. This simply isn’t good enough.

‘If these roads are not going to break up under the strain, the Government needs to give additional funding to local authorities to tackle the maintenance backlog for roads in the areas likely to be affected.

‘Many rural roads have no safe space for walking, cycling or horse riding, so new parallel paths should be considered along routes likely to be affected by construction traffic.’

Hilary Wharf, from the HS2  Action Alliance, a campaign group set up to challenge the high-speed rail link, said: ‘The Government has not been honest about how extensively HS2 will blight people’s homes and disrupt their lives.

‘Experience shows that people on the route lose 30 per cent of the value of their homes.

‘So people who thought they were safe from HS2 will be given an unpleasant surprise.’

Among the other effects of HS2 will be that areas of tranquillity such as Danes Moor in Northamptonshire, site of the Wars of the Roses Battle of Edgecote Moor, and the village of Cubbington, Warwickshire, will face disruption 

In Phase Two of the project, the lines extending from Birmingham to Manchester and Leeds will blight other peaceful spots, such as Waterton Park in West Yorkshire and  Cannock Chase and Fradley Junction in Staffordshire.

Several picturesque locations will also be permanently transformed by embankments, viaducts and cuttings, including 16th Century Lightshaw Hall in Golborne, Wigan,  which could face demolition, and a Roman site at Red Hill in Ratcliffe-on-Soar, Nottinghamshire, where a viaduct could be built.

An HS2 spokesman said: ‘We have considered all construction access routes as part of the development of the draft Environmental Statement on which we consulted earlier  this year.

‘The consultation was open to all members of the public to respond and express potential concerns or suggest alternatives. We have sought to provide construction access with minimal disruption and will continue to work with local communities to take on board their views.

‘In developing the subsequent formal Environmental Statement, we will be considering how we can further reduce any adverse impacts.’

The spokesman added: ‘HS2 Ltd is still developing transport routes for the construction of the line, accordingly it is not possible to definitively say how the road network will be used. The information supplied to the CPRE is based on the most accurate assessment, given the progress of the line’s design at the time.’
