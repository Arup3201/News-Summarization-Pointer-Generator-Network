A heart-warming video has revealed the moment a rapper pulled off an extraordinary proposal to his girlfriend live on stage in front of 1,000 people.

Adam Felman, 24, asked his girlfriend of two-and-a-half-years Jacqueline Harper, 23, to marry him after rapping about his feelings for her in front of the crowd during a battle in Leeds, West Yorkshire.

Mr Felman, of Southend-on-Sea, Essex, who raps under the name Mos Prob - a pun on US rapper Mos Def - told MailOnline he wanted use an original rather than traditional method for the proposal.

Idea: Mr Felman told MailOnline he wanted use an original rather than traditional method for the proposal

It's a match: Mr Felman, from Essex, met his fiancé Miss Harper, from Houston, Texas, while he was rapping

He added: ‘It worked out. It was 
really hot on stage, it's the biggest stage I’ve ever battled on - and 
it got to halfway through the third round and I was like “okay, it's 
actually going to happen”.

‘I
 knew it was right, and it could've gone terribly. The crowd were quite 
quiet and they didn't really know what was going on. Then they cottoned 
on at one moment and I had the confidence to go on.

Mr
 Felman met his fiancée from Houston, Texas, who raps under the name 
Rapunsell, while he was rapping in the past. He said: ‘She didn't think I
 was actually going to do it, but then she cottoned on.

‘She
 was pretty much overwhelmed with people saying congratulations after. I
 was too nervous and had too much adrenaline to shed a tear at the time.
 We watched it back and we bawled our eyes out.’

The couple were battling as a team against rappers ‘Enigma’ and ‘Eek’. The video of the event on November 9
 has racked up more than 90,000 views since being posted on YouTube 
yesterday.

Sealed with a kiss: The couple are planning to get married next year in Britain, Mr Felman told MailOnline

In Love: Mr Felman admitted he 'was too nervous and had too much adreneline to shed a tear at the time'

Mr Felman, who is planning to marry American Miss Harper in Britain next year, rapped about his girlfriend for around two minutes before getting down on one knee.

'I was too nervous and had too much adrenaline to shed a tear at the time. We watched it back and we bawled our eyes out'

He told her their relationship was ‘a silk-hewn tapestry of two people who found still moods on manic streets’ and that ‘from a chance encounter we've built new happy dreams’.

Mr Felman finished off the proposal by adding: ‘So although I'm about to get lambasted on track repeat for attempting this in a battle, please, I'd kill for you Jackie, I love you, will you marry me?’

The couple were battling in an event run by Don't Flop - a British rap battle league founded in 2008. Previous competitors include Rizzle of Rizzle Kicks and Mercury Music Prize nominee Soweto Kinch.

A Don't Flop spokesman said: 'This is the first time in history that a live proposal has happened on stage during a rap battle. Lap it up everyone.'

A lot of people try to prove they're real through battle leagues

A proud display of strength they've revealed through casualties

I'm gonna take off the name 'Prob' in a wilful amnesty

These next few bars I'm gonna don my real dude hat for these

People think it's mad for such a man as me’s lass to be on the battle scene

But the fact that you engage so actively with that part of my personality means it never hassles me when detractors speak

And packed between a bilateral lack of sleep you're a fantastic friend to have with me - so just know that these are not Mos Prob jokes, but Adam's speech

This is a silk-hewn tapestry of two people who found still moods on manic streets

From a chance encounter we've built new happy dreams

And pillow talk over chill blue clashing seas is something I can no longer still do happily

So Jackie, you've helped me reel through bad defeat

So even though you and Two Can compete to rap with me as a team

Even when I can feel you nagging me. Even when a man hates to translate from diapers to nappies and the last thing your family had planned was me

Even when come that age you got mildewed sagging teats and I'm a dad to be and you scratch at me like an angry beast or there's a tragedy and by your side is where I have to be

Our hearts speak plain like a DJ the way they're matching beats

So although I'm about to get lambasted on track repeat for attempting this in a battle, please

I'd kill for you Jackie, I love you, will you marry me?
