Thousands of Hungarians
protested in Budapest  against a planned new tax on internet data transfers which they said would not only increase
the tax burden but also curb fundamental democratic rights
and freedoms.

Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government, which has been
widely accused of adopting anti-democratic policies, first
unveiled plans for the new tax last week in the draft 2015
tax bill submitted to parliament.

The draft tax bill contains a provision for Internet
providers to pay a tax of 150 forints (40 pence) per
gigabyte of data traffic, though it would also let companies
offset corporate income tax against the new levy.

Thousands of Hungarians lift their mobile phones in protest at plans to impose a tax on internet data transfers

Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government, which has been widely accused of adopting anti-democratic policies, first unveiled plans for the new tax last week in the draft 2015 tax bill submitted to parliament

The rally on Sunday was organised by a Facebook group which
has over 210,000 supporters. 

The protesters, which some local
websites estimated as numbering over 10,000, gathered in front
of the Economy Ministry chanting: 'Free Hungary! Free internet!'

The organisers of '100,000 against the Internettax' said in a press release: 'The move... follows a wave of alarming anti-democratic
measures by Orban that is pushing Hungary even further adrift
from Europe.

'The measure would impede equal access to the internet,
deepening the digital divide between Hungary's lower economic
groups, and limiting internet access for cash-poor schools and
universities,' they added.

At one point, protesters held up their mobile phones, lighting up the square in front of the ministry. 

Then they
walked to the city's historic Heroes Square. 

Some of them also
went to the nearby headquarters of the ruling Fidesz party and
threw outdated computer parts at the building, breaking some
windows, local Internet website Index.hu reported.

The organisers gave the government 48 hours to withdraw the
tax legislation and said there would be a fresh protest on
Tuesday if this does not happen.

Fidesz said in a statement on Sunday that on Monday it would
submit an amendment to the legislation in parliament, which
would set a maximum level on the tax payable by individuals.

It
said monthly payments would be capped at 700 forints and internet providers would pay the tax.

But some protesters said the new tax was an epitome of the
government's mistaken economic policies. 

'This would be a double tax on us, as I have already paid a
sky-high VAT when I bought the gadgets, computer and router,'
said Attila Sos, 43, who came to the protest with his family.

'This is a good occasion for a lot of people to come here to
show that they are discontent with the government's tax and
economic policies. This was only the icing on the cake.'

'The Internet connects people and it should not be limited,'
said Krisztina Nagy, 21, who wants to be a Web programmer, and
fears that companies would push the costs of the new tax onto
customers.

Orban's government has in recent years imposed special taxes
on the banking, retail and energy sectors as well as on
telecommunications providers to keep the budget deficit in
check, jeopardising profits in some sectors of the economy and
unnerving international investors.

At the same time, it has cut personal income taxes.
