A heartfelt letter written by Winston Churchill in which he reveals that his fears that he is too old to carry on as Prime Minister has emerged for sale

A heartfelt letter written by Winston Churchill in which he reveals his fears that he is too old to carry on as Prime Minister has emerged for sale.

The letter, dated April 6, 1955 - the day after the war time Prime Minister tendered his resignation to the Queen - was written during his second term in office, while Churchill was 81.

He had suffered a series of strokes which had affected his speech and his ability to walk, and had fallen out of favour with the British public in the years following the war.

In the two-page typewritten letter to prospective Conservative candidate John Harvey, Churchill revealed to his ally that he could not face another four-year term.

The letter reads: 'At a General Election the Head of the Government and Leader of the Party unfolds the policy for the new Parliament, to which he is personally pledged.

'For some time past I have not felt that at my age it would be right for me to incur such new and indefinite responsibilities.

'It is necessary therefore in the public interest that my successor should enter upon his duites in reasonable time to present himself and his programme to the Nation as and when he chooses. I have therefore tendered my resignation to The Queen.'

Churchill goes on to give his full backing to his successor, Anthony Eden, who he commends for upholding the principles of the Conservative Party.

It continues: 'Her Majesty has invited Sir Anthony Eden to form a Government.

'In him the Conservative Party have a leader who has, by his long and distinguished service, gained their full confidence and who will, I am sure, sustain the highest interests and traditions of Britain and uphold the causes of Tory democracy which Lord Beaconsfield proclaimed which Lord Randolph revived, and which I have tried to serve.'

Churchill's first term as Prime Minister began in May 1940 after the resignation of Neville Chamberlain. 

He led the country through World War II, earning himself a reputation as one of the greatest wartime leaders of the 20th century.

However by 1945 he had fallen out of favour and was replaced by Atlee, who had served as Churchill's deputy.

In 1951 the Conservatives were again voted back in with Churchill as their leader but the great man was suffered increasing health problems.

Following his resignation Churchill remained as an MP until standing down at the 1964 election.

He died in January 1965 aged 90.

The letter is tipped to fetch £15,000 when it goes under the hammer at Nate D Sanders in Los Angeles in an online auction ending on March 27.

Laura Yntema, from the auction house, said: 'This letter is not the formal one he would have presented to the Queen but in terms of importance it is a very close second.

'Churchill would only have sent letters of this nature to a few of his closest allies.

'Its significance is huge as it brings to an end the career of one of the greatest politicians of all time.

'During World War II the United States had Franklin D. Roosevelt as its iconic leader and the UK had the equivalent in Winston Churchill.

'Unlike FDR, Churchill survived the war but he wasn't deemed to be as great a peacetime leader as he had been during the conflict and he was defeated in the election of 1945.

'By the time he was voted back into power in 1951 he was an old man and was suffering from a series of health conditions.

'After four more years in charge of the country Churchill felt he had no choice but to hand over the reins to someone else because of his failing health.

'This letter is fascinating as Churchill confides that he had felt for some time that his age and health were a detriment to his leadership of the country.

'Nevertheless, Churchill will always be remembered as one of the greatest wartime leaders of the 20th century and we expect plenty of interest in this historical document.'
