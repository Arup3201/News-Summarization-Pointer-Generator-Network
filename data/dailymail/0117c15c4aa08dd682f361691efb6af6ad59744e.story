Viewers and refugee advocates have accused Channel Seven of broadcasting a 'racist' advertisement for its popular Border Security program.

The network was swamped with criticism on social media after it broadcast a promo for Wednesday night's show featuring a man of Asian descent being questioned by Australian immigration officials.

As the man burps repeatedly, a narrator asks 'what's wrong with Mr Wong' and Kung-fu style sound effects play in the background. The words 'something's wrong with Mr Wong' also appears in an 'Asian-style' font.

Some viewers criticised the television commercial's use of an Asian-style font as 'tacky'.

Ian Rintoul from the Refugee Action Coalition said the 'racist stereotypes' in the advertisement were reminiscent of White Australia Policy era attitudes.

'The Border Security ad is a disgraceful use of racial stereotyping that attempts to both play to, and encourage, racist attitudes,' Mr Rintoul told Daily Mail Australia.

'Even the title of the Border Security segment harks back to the attitudes associated with the immigration policies of White Australia,' he continued.

The verdict was equally dire for Seven on social media. 'WTF is this, 1950s Australia?' Twitter user SCO tweeted.

Sydney viewer Roy Tan wrote: ' "What's wrong with Mr Wong?" + tacky 1960s font? That's the best ur creative team can think of? @Channel7 bringing #racism back'

'Can you be anymore racist?' added user vibrantlymundy.

Audrey Chan, an Arts/Law student at the University of NSW, tweeted: 'What's wrong with Mr Wong?' Channel 7 is what's wrong. Reflecting racial stereotypes isn't the way to go'.

Pained? 'Mr Wong' appears to struggle through some medical difficulties as he is questioned by Australian officials.

Mr Wong was brandishing a passport from the Republic of Korea when he arrived in Australia.

'JL' added: 'Not sure which is worse - @channel7 Border Security promo headline "What's wrong with Mr Wong" or the tacky asian font it was written in.'

Many Seven viewers could only express their shock.

Chloe Rose said 'channel seven you've outdone yourself'. Teresa Hunyh wrote: 'Australian border security actually went there "what's wrong with mr wong" '.

Other Seven viewers were so angered they said they lodged formal complaints about the ad with commercial TV industry body Free TV Australia.

Mixed reactions: Some viewers were scathing, while others noted it was not the most 'PC' or politically correct way of advertising a program.

Border Security: Australia's Front Line is consistently one of the Seven Network's most popular prime time programs.

Samuel Lockwood, lead guitarist of Australian band The Jezabels, told Daily Mail Australia the advertisement's 'cheap stereotypes' fired him and his partner up so much they both made complaints.

'I've got a lot of Asian friends, being Australian, and it just made me really sad and angry at the same time,' Mr Lockwood said.

Race Discrimination Commissioner Tim Soutphommasane said a number of viewers had raised their concerns about the commercial with him.

'I can understand why some people may find it offensive on racial grounds,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'The advertisement’s portrayal of race should be open to debate.'

'As a general principle, Australia is a multicultural society and we should be mature enough to avoid gratuitously humiliating or degrading people on the grounds of race,' he said.

In 1947, Ben Chifley's Immigration Minister Arthur Calwell famously quipped 'two Wongs don't make a White' in Parliament.

The remark was considered symbolic of Australia's anti-Asian immigration policy at the time.

Hosted by Amazing Race frontman Grant Bowler, Border Security is consistently one of Seven's biggest rating prime time programs.

According to the OzTam ratings, last week it garnered an audience of 975,000 viewers in the five major capital cities.

That made it the top-rating program behind the major news and current affairs shows and Channel Nine's prime time heavyweight The Block.

The Seven Network were approached for comment but did not respond to Daily Mail Australia's questions by deadline.
