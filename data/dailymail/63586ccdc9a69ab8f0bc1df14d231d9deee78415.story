A seven-year old girl was raped at her school in New Delhi on Thursday, according to police.

The injured girl was taken by her parents from the school in the Mangolpuri area to the Sanjay Gandhi hospital nearby for treatment.

Doctors there confirmed that she had been sexually assaulted.

According to the girl's family, the incident happened after the girl had been having lunch at the government-run school. The girl said that she did not recognise her attacker.

Outside the hospital around 400 people led a demonstration for three hours on Friday morning to put pressure on police to take the complaint seriously.

Police dispersed the crowd with batons after protesters began pelting stones at them and vandalised two buses.

This latest incident comes against a backdrop of growing anger over attitudes to rape and sexual violence in India.

There were huge protests in New Delhi in December after a 23-year-old student was gang raped on a bus and subsequently died.

Her father said that she had 'awakened the nation's conscience' as thousands of people turned out to mourn her death.

Two of the most notable cases over the past month involved another seven-year-old girl at a school in Goa, prompting protests outside her school.

Another rape resulted in the death of three girls on Valentine's Day in in the Bhandara district near the city of Nagpur.

As news of the rape of a seven-year-old schoolgirl spread, a mob gathered on the streets and vented their ire by pelting stones.

The agitation was fuelled further by rumours of the girl's death.

The crowd damaged three DTC buses and two PCR vans and police had to resort to lathicharge to bring the rampaging crowd under control.

The police said the alleged rape took place at the North Delhi Municipal Corporation-run school during the lunch break.

"The victim told her parents that she was in her classroom when a person came and took her away.

"She claimed that the man tied her hands and put a cloth in her mouth and took her to the first floor of the school," a police officer said.

Her parents only got to know of the incident at night as the girl was too traumatised to say anything.

On Friday they took her to the school from where she was taken to Sanjay Gandhi Hospital.

The medical examination confirmed rape.

Later, a case was registered against an unknown person.

The victim was shown five persons and was asked to identify the accused, but she could not as she was in trauma.

The police have picked up three persons for questioning and have detained 14 people for rioting.

Chief minister Sheila Dikshit has decried the incident as inhuman and shameful. "It is a shocking incident. The municipal corporations must strengthen their existing security infrastructure in schools," Dikshit said.

She also directed chief secretary DM Spolia to take up the matter with the concerned civic officials.

Following the alleged sexual attack, North corporation officials reiterated their promise to provide more security to students and install CCTVs in schools.

It has also emerged that none of the 1,639 schools under the three corporations has CCTV cameras.
