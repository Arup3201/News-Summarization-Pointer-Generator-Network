A former NBA player has been charged with a gun crime after a police raid on the house of an alleged drug-dealer where he was staying uncovered heroin, meth, guns, a grenade launcher and several prostitutes.

Robert Swift, 28, who joined the Seattle Sonics straight out of high school, has been described as a ’heavily armed heroin addict’ by prosecutors in King Country, Washington.

Police raided the property last month, and seized a number of weapons from Swift’s bedroom, including a military-style grenade launcher and sawed-off shotgun.

Arsenal: Recovered weapons from the October 4 bust. Prosecutors describe Swift, 28, as a heavily armed heroin addict who admitted to helping his drug dealer-turned-roommate collect a drug debt. That man, 54-year-old Trygve Bjorkstam, is accused of amassing an 18-gun arsenal to protect his drug business

On Thursday, Swift was charged Thursday with unlawful possession of a short-barreled shotgun, after police found seven firearms on or under his bed and a 40mm grenade launcher in a safe in his room, in addition to the sawed-off shotgun, KOMO News reports.

Swift denied involvement in dealing the drugs, but admitted to having drug paraphernelia in his bedroom, and claimed several suppressors and weapons as his property.

The fallen star has been living with the owner of the house, Trygve Bjorkstam, 54, who Swift told police is his heroin dealer, since he was kicked out of his foreclosured home in suburban Seattle last year.

Mr Bjorkstam, who faces federal drug and gun charges after running his illegal business – which included housing prostitutes and an underground bunker used as a marijuana grow and a shooting range – 100 yards from an elementary school, told police Swift was a ’good guy’ who was helping him collect a drug debt from a competitor.

Swift has been ordered held on $20,000 bail. He has no criminal history.

Tragic: Swift (pictured in 2006) was drafted straight out of high school, but had not played professionally since 2011, and admitted to police that he was addicted to heroin and using it daily

This is only the latest chapter in the sad saga of the fall of Robert Swift , who was plucked straight out of high school to play NBA basketball at the age of 18, and was a number one draft pick for the Sonics in 2004.

Earning multi-million dollar salaries, he played for Seattle and Oklahoma City, who renounced their rights to Swift in December 2009.

He attempted a comeback in Japan the following year with the Tokyo Apaches, but the team was dissolved after the 2011 Tsunami.

Last year, MailOnline reported how Swift was kicked out of his home in upmarket Seattle suburb of Sammamish, which he had for $1.35million in 2006.

The house went into foreclosure after Swift was found to owe $168,000 on his mortgage despite earning $20m during his career. 

Despite the house being sold to new owners in February 2013, Swift refused to move out and squatted in  in squalor, before finally being kicked out in March.

Swift's former home(pictured in 2013)  showed evidence of Swift having a drinking problem, with beer and spirits bottles lying around in and around the property among his personal possessions, dog faeces and litter

When the new owners, Mr and Mrs Dalzell finally got into their new home, they were horrified by what they saw.

Everywhere were bottles of alcohol and prescription drugs, multiple weapons and live ammunition scattered around and the basement had been turned into a makeshift shooting range.

The garden was littered with empty beer cans,a garage window had a bullet hole in it and out the front was a car and a pick up truck with no engine.

Perhaps the most poignant items of all were Swift’s personal possessions which showed the life he once had - letters and photos from his once promising career. 

Mr Dalzell told MailOnline: ‘There must have been more than 100 pizza boxes strewn everywhere. I counted thousands of liquor bottles too - vodka, Dom Perignon, Crystal, and one bottle of King Louis XIII cognac.

‘There were maggots in the sink and a five gallon drum you would normally use for cooling water was full of urine.

‘The pile of animal feces on the deck was about 1ft high. We’re talking 100lbs of dog crap. It had been piled up with a shovel and looked like it had been tended to then let go wild’.

Mr Dalzell said that he has spent $5,000 cleaning up the house and that it took four dumpsters to get all the mess out.
