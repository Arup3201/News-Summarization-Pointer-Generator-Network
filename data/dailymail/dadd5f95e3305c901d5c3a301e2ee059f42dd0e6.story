The mother of a British backpacker missing in the jungle has touched down in Malaysia to see the manhunt that has been launched to find him.

Gareth
 Huntley, who is on a sabbatical from his job in the City, has not been 
seen since he went on a trek to visit a waterfall in Tioman Island last 
Tuesday morning.

Janet Southwell arrived on the island of Tioman today, saying she was staying positive in the hope that she will be the 'friendly face' he needs when he comes out of the jungle.

His mother, Janet Southwell, arrived in Malaysia on Monday after Prime Minister David Cameron spoke to Malaysia's prime minister Najib Razak about the search effort

She told the BBC: 'I want to see the area for myself, absolutely, get a feel for where he's lost, where he's missing.

'I just want to be here when they find him. I think he will want to see a familiar face.

'I'm obviously very concerned. It's going to be a good outcome, so I just have to focus on that.'

Speaking about the stress she has expeirenced since Gareth went missing, she added: 'I wouldn't wish any mother to go through this.

'This is an incredibly tense and stressful time... It is vital that the intense jungle search continues and we hope everyone can pray with us for Gareth's safe return.'

Mr Huntley's brother Mark, 30, said: 'She is at base camp. She has spoken to officials on the ground.

'There are 103 people searching, with more potentially on the way. We have multiple helicopters and now there are speedboat crafts out searching.

'The key for us now is to remain positive. It could be that if we can keep people positive, it could make a difference. Everyone out there has been really good.

'If we can keep that going, then maybe the authorities will be kept positive and we will be able to keep their support.

'They have been very good and we would like more recruits to help with the search and to keep pushing this thing.

'Considering the situation, we are all positive. We know he is a very resourceful and intelligent person and if he can do anything to help himself, he will.

Missing: Gareth Huntley went missing last Tuesday after deciding to trek to a waterfall in the jungle

'There are many stories in the past of
 people being in the jungle for a long time but they have come out 
safely, maybe a bit hungry and physically not in good condition but they
 are safe.

'We need people to go out there searching on the ground. He may be injured but he is capable of surviving.'

He
 said he might consider travelling to Malaysia at some point, adding: 
'Even though I am here (in Britain) looking after things, it somehow 
does not feel like I am doing enough.'

Last Friday a professional search team 
was deployed on the island of Tioman, including ten paramilitary 
commandos, five police officers, three guides with search dogs, a fire 
and rescue team, two boats and a helicopter.

Mr
 Huntley left the headquarters of the Juara Turtle Project, where he was
 working, on May 27 to hike through the jungle. He told staff he would 
be back that afternoon but failed to return.

The British Government has stepped up 
attempts to find the 34-year-old, who is originally from the 
Leeds-Bradford border, while Defence Secretary Philip Hammond has been 
assured that 'all available search assets' are being used.

Faith: Both Gareth's mother and girlfriend are hopeful that Gareth can be found

Mr Huntley's family have praised the 'fantastic' attempts to find the trained accountant.

His younger brother, Mark, said the family are keeping positive as a result of efforts to find him.

He said: 'We want to personally thank David Cameron and Philip Hammond for their reassurances. It is a very big positive for us.

'We are, of course, very grateful to the Malaysian people and the authorities for their work too. Everyone has been fantastic.

'We
 are told that local people went out to look for Gareth as soon as he 
was first described as missing - so without them there would not be a 
search mission.

'What we need now is for that work to continue and to find my brother.'

Last week Mrs Southwell explained that it was out of character for her son to go missing. 'He's got an 
exploring nature, he's intelligent, and hopefully his ability to apply 
himself will get him through this.

'He
 was on a break from work, he was due to start a new job in Singapore 
next week. It's totally out of character for him to go missing, he just 
would not do it. He knows there are too many people who care and love 
him.'

Mr Huntley's girlfriend Kit Natariga arrived on the island yesterday.

Miss
 Natariga admitted time to find him was 'running out'. She told Sky 
News: 'It's really tough coming onto the island, we're in a bit of a 
helpless state. We cannot give up... time is running out.'

She
 said her boyfriend was an experienced backpacker and adventurer who 
would take utmost care in ensuring he was prepared for excursions.

A
 Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said: 'The Defence Secretary,
 who is in Malaysia, has spoken to the Malaysian Defence Minister to 
confirm that all available search assets are used to find Gareth 
Huntley.

'He was assured that the Malaysian authorities would do all they could to locate him and had already deployed significant assets including dogs, boats and a helicopter.

'The Government will continue to work with the Malaysian authorities to ensure there is a comprehensive search.'

Kit Natariga also headed to Tioman Island to join the search for her boyfriend Gareth (left)

Fellow volunteer Charles 
Fisher said a group went to search for him after he did not return from 
the 'huge wilderness'.

They 
checked various different routes to the waterfall 6km away that he might
 have taken, while a further search the next day also proved fruitless.

Mr
 Fisher added: 'Then the afternoon of the second day the police were 
informed - they sent a couple of members of the police force along to 
have a look but didn't go far or look very much - they were just sort of
 assessing the situation.

Last week Mrs Southwell explained that it was out of character for her son to go missing. 'He's got an exploring nature, he's intelligent, and hopefully his ability to apply himself will get him through this'

'Then
 the next day, the 29th, a group of volunteers went out and looked then 
came back again. Another group from the local community also went out as
 well and went deep into the jungle.

'The police were no longer 
physically looking at that point - I think they were arranging for a 
search party but nothing happened that day.

'It's
 a huge wilderness out there - a remote location. He could have taken a 
wrong turn and just got lost in another valley - we just don't know. The
 trouble is the police probably don't have proper search equipment - 
they need extra support.'

A Facebook group has been set up to raise awareness about Mr Huntley's disappearance.
