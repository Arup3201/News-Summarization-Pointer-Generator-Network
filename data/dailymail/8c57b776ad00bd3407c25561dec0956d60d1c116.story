Nine men accused of a string of sexual offences involving a 14-year-old girl have walked free from court after the cases against them were dropped after an old twitter account was examined.

The suspects, aged between 21 and 30, were accused of abusing a teenager in hotels and cars in London over six months last year.

But prosecutor Samantha Cohen told the judge
 there would be no evidence against them, after an old Twitter account 
used by the complainant, a then-14-year-old girl , had been examined at 
'the highest level' of the Crown Prosecution Service and the police.

Released: The nine men charged with a string of sexual offences were told they were free to go after an old Twitter account was examined

Desmond Agyei, 23, Edward Kofi Edunya, 23, Perry Murray, 24, David Sarpong, 23, Adedeji Atitebi, 21, Austin Odisi, 24, Justin Maynard, 23, Olanrewaju Sonde, 24 and Thamsanqa Sibanda, 30 - had originally been charged with 28 offences, including several rapes.

It comes 48 hours after Coronation Street actor Michael Le Vell was cleared of 12 child sex offences at Manchester Crown Court.

The men, from London, remained silent as Judge John Bevan recorded not guilty verdicts.

Friends and relatives in a packed public gallery applauded as the men walked free.

Speaking as he left the courtroom, Mr Sonde said: 'It’s just a relief that this is finally over.'

The precise content of the Tweets was not disclosed to the Old Bailey, but prosecutor Samantha Cohen said they had been reviewed at the ‘highest level.’

‘The consequence of the review of that material which has been conducted at the highest level is that there is no longer a realistic prospect of a conviction of any defendant on any charge on the indictment,’ she said.

‘For that reason the Crown offer no evidence against the defendants in this case.’

She added: ‘This Twitter material had come to light because it had not be disclosed on two occasions by the complainant.

Judge John Bevan said: ‘It has been considered with very great care and it is not for me to go into it.

‘It is unfortunate that it has happened so late and it is unfortunate that the defendants have been in custody.’
