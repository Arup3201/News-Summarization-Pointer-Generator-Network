A dangerous shrimp that could decimate British waterways has been found in the UK.

The killer crustacean - branded a 'voracious predator' by the Environment Agency has been found in the Worcester and Birmingham canal following previous sighting in the River Severn.

It arrived in the UK from Eastern Europe, and feeds on fish, sparking fears it could dramatically change the UK's delicate marine ecosystem.

Public enemy number one: The 'killer shrimp' that could decimate Britain's waterways. The Environment Agency today issued a high alert warning people to look out for it.

Adults are up to 30mm in length.

The body is curled and semi-transparent.

They have two pairs of antennae and large, powerful mandibles.

Newly hatched young are about 1.8mm in length and resemble adults.

According to the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, 
the killer shrimp is 'a voracious predator' that 'kills a range of 
native species, including young fish, and can significantly alter 
ecosystems'.

Regarding its cousin, the Environment Agency says it is 'uncertain at this stage what its impact might be'.

Experts have scrambled a team of investigators dedicated to tracking the shrimps’ movements and how quickly they are spreading throughout the country.

The Environment Agency’s Area Manager for Worcs, David Throup, said; 'We are concerned that this invasive species has been found in the Midlands.

'We now have a dedicated team whose focus is to establish the degree of the problem, and whether the shrimp has spread wider than the locations already found.

'We are treating this as a priority so that we can come up with a plan to help contain its spread as far as possible.'

The alien shrimp - proper name 
Dikerogammarus haemobaphes - is a relative of a non-native species that 
has migrated from Eastern Europe.

The
 new shrimp was first discovered in the River Severn but has now been 
found in two canals, showing the creature has spread over a distance of 
more than 20 miles.

Anglers and other users of Midlands 
waterways are being urged to check, clean and dry all their equipment 
after use, especially nets, and to drain, clean and dry boats and 
kayaks.

The Birmingham canal where the shrimp was spotted

Experts have already begun capturing the shrimps in British waters.

The new shrimp was first found after samples were taken from the River Severn by Severn Trent Water near Worcester, but has since been found in two canals, showing the creature had spread over a distance of more than 20 miles.

This is the first time the shrimp has been found in the UK.

The shrimp at different stages of its life

British Shrimp form a valuable part of the UK's marine ecosystem - but there are fears a new Eastern European species could cause havoc.
