Manchester City have been praised for taking a stand against racism after Patrick Vieira took his elite development team off the pitch when one of his young players,  Seko Fofana, was allegedly racially abused.

Midfielder Fofana, 19, was sent off for  kicking out at an opponent moments after he believed he was racially abused during the pre-season friendly against HNK Rijeka in Croatia on Tuesday.

Stopped: The match is abandoned as Vieira leads his team off the pitch in Croatia after the incident

It is understood Vieira, once alerted 
to Fofana’s complaint, went on to the pitch and, after talking to the 
referee and other City officials, told his players to leave the field.

Piara
 Power, the executive director of  Football Against Racism in Europe, 
praised Vieira, saying: ‘The message it sends out is categorical. It is 
just the sort of thing which will create change.’

But
 the Croatia side rejected City’s account on Wednesday, claiming that 
they had invented allegations of racism to cover up a poor tackle by 
Fofana.

Ranko Buketa, the 
sport co-ordinator of HNK Rijeka, said: ‘It seems that this is the way 
in which they are  trying to hide a very hard tackle from a Manchester 
City player that resulted in an exclusion, followed by a hasty and 
illogical decision of the  Manchester City coaching staff on the 
withdrawal of the team from the field. The game was most of all within 
the limits of fair play.’

Unfortunately, this isn't the first example in which a team have staged a walk-off after alleged racial abuse:

- In 2013, Kevin-Prince Boateng led his AC Milan team-mates off the pitch after black players were subjected to racist abuse during a friendly at fourth division side Pro Patria.

The former Tottenham and Portsmouth forward kicked the ball into the crowd after 26 minutes of the goalless match in Busto Arsizio

- Later that year, Milan were rocked by another racism flashpoint as Kevin Constant reacted angrily to tormentors in a pre-season tournament but he was substituted rather than the match being abandoned.

- Also in 2013, a Watford Under-19 side were taking part in the Wojtyla Cup in Rome when academy coach Dave Hughes ordered his players to leave the pitch after alleged racist abuse.

He added that the fact they had six Nigerian players was evidence of their commitment to challenging racial prejudice.

City
 are continuing to piece together the evidence before submitting a 
protest to the Croatian Football Federation and are  prepared to take 
the issue to UEFA and FIFA if the case reaches an unsatisfactory 
conclusion.

Fofana would be 
the fourth City player to become a victim of racial abuse in just over 
two years, following Mario Balotelli, Yaya Toure and academy star 
Devante Cole, son of former City striker Andrew.

Privately,
 City are furious at the relaxed attitude towards racism in mainland 
Europe, although an insider insisted that City are less concerned about 
the punishment than being safe in the knowledge that they took the 
correct course of action in leaving the field.

Vieira
 rates Fofana among the club’s most promising talents. The youngster was
 said to be ‘deeply distressed’ by the incident and there was no 
disguising the anger among staff and players as they flew back to 
Manchester on Wednesday after a 10-day training camp in Croatia.

No laughing matter: Vieira took his players off the pitch after allegations of racist abuse during pre-season

Making his point: Vieira was integral to Manchester City's players development and was in pre-season

Stepping in: After the incident, Man City coach Patrick Vieira stepped in to have the game cancelled
