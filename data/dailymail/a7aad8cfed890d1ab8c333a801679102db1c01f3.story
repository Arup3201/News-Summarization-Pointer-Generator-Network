Look from a distance and this opportune photo could be mistaken for looking like a polar bear's head - but in actual fact it is a Mola Mola fish.

The snap, captured by photographer Amos Nachoum, off the coast of South Africa.

It shows the fish in its natural habitat with the light reflecting off its rotund, scaly body, making it gleam white like a polar bear.

The enormous Mola Mola, which is also commonly known as the sunfish, develop their truncated, bullet-like shape because the back fin, with which they are born, never grows.

Weighing in at 1000kg, the Mola Mola is one of the heaviest fish in the ocean.

All three species of sunfish are found in all tropical and temperate oceans.

The word mola comes from Latin and means millstone–in reference to these fishes’ roundish shape.

Mola molas got became more widely known as 'ocean sunfish' because of their habit of lying atop the surface of the water appearing to sunbathe.

The peculiar looking fish has been discovered much further away from its normal habitats.

A dog walker made a rare discovery when he found a six stone Mola mola fish the size of a child washed up on the beach near his home.

Matt Hyde, 44, was walking his Labrador Jimmy along The Sandilands beach near Sutton-on-Sea, Lincolnshire when he nearly tripped over the blob-like creature.

The find was even more unusual than he thought as it turned out to be a a Mola mola, or Ocean sunfish, which normally lives thousands of miles away in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.
