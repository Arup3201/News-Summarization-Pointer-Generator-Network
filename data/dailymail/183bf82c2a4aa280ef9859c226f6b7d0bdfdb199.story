Outspoken: Katie Hopkins has sparked outrage by tweeting about Scottish life expectancy

Katie Hopkins has sparked widespread outrage by mocking the short life expectancy in Scotland just a day after the Glasgow helicopter crash.

The former Apprentice star tweeted: 'Life expectancy in Scotland is 59.5. Goodness me. That lot will do anything to avoid working until retirement.'

Thousands of web users were offended by the joke, which came the day after a helicopter crashed through the roof of the Clutha pub, killing nine and injuring dozens more.

Ms Hopkins initially refused to apologise, instead mocking those who expressed anger, but she has now backed down and admitted the quip was 'terribly ill timed'.

Thousands of people have now signed a petition calling for her to be taken off the air by television bosses.

The TV personality is well-known as a controversialist, appearing on programmes such as This Morning to give her views on topics such as bad parenting and political correctness.

On her Twitter feed, she rails against aspects of modern life in short messages to her 82,000 followers.

The tweet about Scotland referred to an official document detailing life expectancy trends across the country - although 59.5 is in fact the 'healthy' life expectancy for Scottish men, not the total figure.

As soon Ms Hopkins' message was published on Saturday, other Twitter fans started to suggest that it was in poor taste given the Clutha disaster which happened on Friday night.

Apology: The former Apprentice star has backed down over the 'terrible timing' of her tweet

Several people accused her of 'racism', while others suggested that she should be reported to the police.

The outspoken star started retweeting many of the insults she received, and wrote: 'Yikes, I am being reported to Channel 4 and the BBC. In a moment I will forced to read the Labour manifesto and subscribe to the Guardian.'

She added: 'There appear to be a number of conflicting petitions out there to have me hung and quartered. Please do feel free to sign them all. PC tastic'.

The most popular petition, 'Remove Katie Hopkins from all programmes and interviews', has attracted 43,000 signatures on Change.org and is directed at producers from ITV and Channel 5.

It reads: 'On the 30th of November 2013, Scotland was still in shock and trying to come to terms with a horrible crash that took the lives of innocent people. Within 24 hours of this happening Katie Hopkins posted vile remarks on Twitter about how long the people of Scotland live for.

'This is unacceptable and distressing to those who lost friends and family. We the undersigned are sick and tired of ITV and Channel 5 giving her
airtime and want her banned from all TV shows on your channels such as 
This Morning and The Wright Stuff.

'This woman is nothing more than an attention seeker who does not deserve to be a celebrity.'

Ms Hopkins finally apologised for the tweet today, saying that it was only intended to relate to the official document and adding: 'I apologise to those I offended. It was poor timing.'

She continued: 'The timing was terrible. I apologise to everyone. xx'
