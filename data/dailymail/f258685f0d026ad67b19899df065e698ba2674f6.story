Wise spent almost a decade plying his trade with the Blues and garnered a reputation as a teak-tough midfielder.

The ex-Chelsea midfielder's barnet inspired a flurry of activity on Twitter with Wise's former Blues team-mate Mario Melchiot particularly impressed.

Melchiot posted on his account: 'Dennis Wise is definitely stealing the haircut show on Twitter.'
