Jules Bianchi's girlfriend sent out a tweet praying for his recovery as he fought for his life after a horrific crash at the Japanese Grand Prix.

Bianchi suffered sever head injuries after he span off the rain-soaked track and crashed into the side wall. The unconscious 25-year-old was taken to Mie University hospital and immediately underwent surgery.

Camille Marchetti, Bianchi's long-term partner, led the tributes while the world waited for news of the Frenchman's condition.

'You are my champion! You are the strongest,' she wrote on Twitter, ending the tweet with an emoticon heart. 

Marchetti is an osteopathy student at the Collège Ostéopathique de Provence in France who originally hails from the Mediterranean island of Corsica.

She is well-known in the Formula 1 community and is often seen cheering Bianchi on from the pits as he races around the world. Known also for her glamorous attire and interest in fashion, she regularly accompanies him to F1 events and parties.

Bianchi is a graduate of the Ferrari academy and former Ferrari driver Felipe Massa and team principal Marco Mattiacci went with him to hospital.

It comes as Bianchi's Marussia team asked for 'patience and understanding' as it released a statement thanking people for the 'huge outpouring of support and affection for Jules and the team at this very difficult time'. 

It continued: 'With regard to the communication of information concerning Jules' medical condition, we will respect and be guided by the wishes of the Bianchi family.

'Together with Jules' care, they will remain our highest priority.

'Therefore, we would ask for patience and understanding with regard to further medical updates.'

It is the most serious accident to hit a race weekend since Felipe Massa fractured his skull and spent a week in a coma while qualifying for the Hungarian Grand Prix, in 2009.

Officials immediately red-flagged the Suzuka Grand Prix, meaning championship leader Lewis Hamilton claimed his third win in succession and eighth of the season.

But celebrations on the podium were muted after news of Bianchi's condition broke.

'It's obviously a real anti-climax to hear that one of our fellow colleagues is seriously injured so that's really the main worry,' Mercedes' race winner Lewis Hamilton told the BBC.

'You could see some commotion and the car was really badly damaged on the right. We just hope he's OK.'

He said: 'Our first thoughts go to Jules - it overshadows everything else when one of our colleagues is injured and we are praying for him.
