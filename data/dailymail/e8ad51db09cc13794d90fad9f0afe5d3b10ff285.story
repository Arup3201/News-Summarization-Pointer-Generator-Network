Bob Geldof has paid an emotional tribute to his daughter Peaches who has died today

'Writing "was" destroys me afresh.

'She was the wildest, funniest, cleverest, wittiest and the most bonkers of all of us.

'What a beautiful child. How is this possible that we will not see her again?

'How is that bearable? We loved her and will cherish her forever. How sad that sentence is.

'Tom and her sons Astala and Phaedra will always belong in our family, fractured so often, but never broken.

'Bob, Jeanne, Fifi, Pixie and Tiger Geldof.'

The mother-of-two was found by police at her house in Wrotham, Kent, at 1.35pm.

Kent Police said the death was 'sudden' and 'unexplained'.

Peaches was a young girl when her mother Paula Yates died of a drug overdose in 2000.

The 25-year-old had admitted she never really got over her parents' very public divorce in 1996, which became notoriously bitter, or her mother Paula's death just four years later in 2000.

She said: 'I remember the day my mother died, and it’s still hard to talk about it. I just blocked it out. I went to school the next day because my father’s mentality was "keep calm and carry on".

'So we all went to school and tried to act as if nothing had happened. But it had happened.

'I didn’t grieve. I didn’t cry at her funeral. I couldn’t express anything because I was just numb to it all.

'I didn’t start grieving for my mother properly until I was maybe 16.'

The Boomtown Rats singer raised his three daughters Fifi Trixibelle, Peaches and Pixie after the death of their mother.

He also brought up Tiger Lily - Paula's daughter with INXS singer Michael Hutchence.

Peaches husband Thomas Cohen said: 'My beloved wife Peaches was adored by 
myself and her two sons Astala and Phaedra and I shall bring them up 
with their mother in their hearts everyday.

'We shall love her forever. Thomas, Astala and Phaedra Geldof-Cohen.'

The
 last tweet Peaches sent on Twitter was on Sunday, when she posted a 
photograph of herself as a child and her mother, with the caption: 'Me 
and my mum.'

She was previously married to rock musician Max Drummey but the pair separated in 2009 after a six-month marriage.

In a statement, Kent Police said: 'Police were called at 13:35 on 7 April, 2014 to an address near Wrotham following a report of concern for the welfare of a woman.

'A woman aged 25 was pronounced dead by South East Coast Ambulance Service.

'Officers are working to establish the circumstances around the death.'
