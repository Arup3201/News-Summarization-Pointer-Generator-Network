A jealous woman, who was part of a kinky sex slave ring, strangled a beautiful Marine's wife who she thought was trying to come between her and her 'master', according to newly unsealed search warrants.

Jessica Lopez, 25, is one of three suspects accused of murdering 22-year-old Brittany Killgore, whose body was discovered near a Southern California lake in April.

Three days before her disappearance she filed for divorce from Lance Cpl. Cory Killgore, who was serving in Afghanistan at the time.

Jealousy? A suicide note allegedly written by Jessica Lopez (Left) details how she strangled Marine's wife Brittany Killgore (right) after Killgore became involved with a man she was having a relationship with 

The newly unsealed search warrants suggest Lopez was in a relationship with her two co-defendants U.S Marine Staff Sgt. Louis Ray Perez, 45, and Dorothy Maraglino, 36.

The three lived togther in a home in Fallbrook, near San Diego. Detectives who searched the property found what they described as a 'sex room/dungeon' with 'several bondage type apparatuses; toys and tools.'

Lopez was charged with Mrs Killgore's murder after she was found at a San Diego motel room having stabbed herself multiple times.

Although none of her injuries were 
life threatening, she had written a seven-page suicide note detailing 
what happened to Mrs Killgore and where her body was dumped. 

Search
warrants, which were unsealed yesterday at the request of news 
organisations, reveal the contents of the note in which Lopez uses a 
variety of profanities to describe Mrs Killgore.

'Master'? Marine Staff Sgt. Louis Perez is accused of luring Mrs Killgore to her death

She also refers to a 'master' and 'mistress' believed to be Perez and Maraglino. 

The note reveals how Lopez believed 
Mrs Killgore was trying to come between her, Perez and Maraglino and how
she acted after the victim told her that she had a 'whole night 
planned' with Perez, a Marine.

Lopez said she had been burned before in a relationship and knew what she had to do when Mrs Killgore entered their home.

Lopez said she shot the victim with a stun gun, wrapped a rope around a neck, buried her face in a pillow and strangled her.

The letter reads: 'She barely moved but she just wouldn't die, the miserable whore.'

'Mistress': Co-accused Dorothy Maraglino, 36, was allegedly part of the sex slave ring

Lopez
said she made 'a few attempts to chop her up' with Perez's power tools 
and doused Mrs Killgore's body in bleach to get rid of evidence before 
dumping the nude body near Lake Skinner, near Riverside.

The handwritten letter, which was discovered below a mirror scrawled with the word 'PIGS READ THIS' - accused police of 'complete incompetence.'

'Master I am so sorry I dragged you into this,' it reads. 'I thought I was defending the family and it would be simple like Dexter (a serial killer in a television show).

'To Mistress I have always lived to be your slave & pet I'm sorry my last act is to leave this world without permission but I cannot bear your grief & my guilt at seeing Master go through this from my choice.'

The documents say her body was found with neck injuries consistent with strangulation and marks on her wrist and leg that suggested someone tried to use a saw or other tool to dismember her.

The letter details where the body was dumped, telling police they would likely find handcuff marks on the wrists. It says the handcuffs and a knife were disposed at a beach restroom in Oceanside.

Three days after Mrs Killgore vanished, detectives searched Perez's mud-caked Ford Explorer and found a plastic bag with a stun gun, latex gloves and Killgore's blood. Perez's DNA was found on the stun gun.

The documents describe an elaborate ruse for Perez to conceal his whereabouts on the night Mrs Killgore vanished.

Broken relationship: Three days before her disappearance Mrs Killgore filed for divorce from Lance Cpl. Cory Killgore, who was serving in Afghanistan at the time

Prosecuters have alleged Mrs Killgore was lured to her death through a conspiracy executed by the trio.

They
claim she was convinced to go on a boat cruise with Maraglino, 36, but 
on the drive there with  Perez, 45, texted the word 'help' to a friend.

On the day she disappeared Mrs Killgore sent a text message to a friend that said, 'Help'

Within minutes, according to investigators, Perez had himself texted Maraglino asking her to meet him at the home they shared with Jessica Lynn Lopez, 25, and on April 17, Killgore's nude body was found on the side of the road.

Perez, a Marine told detectives he picked up Mrs Killgore for the dinner cruise but instead dropped her off at a downtown San Diego nightclub. He said he couldn't find her at the club after parking and returned home.

Mrs Killgore's and Perez's cell phones remained in Fallbrook that night, contradicting his statement that he was in San Diego, according to authorities.

Mrs Killgore sent a text message to a friend that said, 'Help,' at 7:50 p.m., about 13 minutes after Perez picked her up. The friend asked if she was OK and insisted she call.

About two hours later, the friend got a response, 'Yes I love this party,' which fueled suspicions because Mrs Killgore always texted 'yeah' instead of 'yes' and had said nothing about going to a party.

A transient found Mrs Killgore's phone at his feet when he woke up in the doorway of a downtown San Diego hotel that night. A San Diego County sheriff's detective said he believed Perez drove downtown to get rid of the phone.

The documents give no indication that Mrs Killgore knew about the sex ring and prosecutors call her an innocent victim.

Detectives said she accepted Perez's invitation to a San Diego dinner cruise after Perez helped her move that afternoon. The warrants do not say how Killgore met the suspects.

All three have pleaded not guilty to murder.

Sloan Ostbye, Lopez's attorney, didn't immediately respond to a phone message Wednesday.

She joined the San Diego County district attorney's office in an appeal to keep the documents sealed, calling much of her client's letter 'false or at least misleading and possibly delusional.'
