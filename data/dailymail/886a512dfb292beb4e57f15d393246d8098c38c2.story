Jack Wilshere should be giving Arsene Wenger no choice but to make him Arsenal’s next captain. Instead, the talented midfielder is watching the armband drift further and further away.

There’s nothing Arsenal fans want more than to see one of their own leading them out on a match day.

Because that’s what Wilshere is: a Gooner through and through. The next Tony Adams, if you like.

Controversy: Jack Wilshere is caught smoking while on holiday in Las Vegas

But his recent antics in Las Vegas have raised further question marks over his suitability as a future  Arsenal captain.

‘Arsene Wenger has to have a word with Jack and tell him the responsibility he has now got,’ said former Gunners boss George Graham. ‘They were talking about him being a future Arsenal captain, and a captain shouldn’t be acting like that.’

Graham talks from a position of strength. He dealt with the wayward tendencies of ex-skipper Adams during the early part of  the Arsenal legend’s career. He knows what it takes to be an Arsenal captain — on and off the pitch.

It’s important to remember, however, that smoking and drinking boisterously in public was more widely accepted in Adams’ era than it is today.

You could drink 10 pints, smoke a packet of Benson and Hedges and get away with it in training the morning after.

The science involved in modern day football, not to mention the frenzied media attention, means that is no longer the case. 

On the pitch, Wilshere — who is hugely self-critical of his performances — still has much to learn.

He’ll be the first to admit that. But it is his failure to learn away from the game that is causing Arsenal the biggest headache at the moment.

Just what impact his Vegas jaunt has on those gruelling pre-season fitness tests when Wilshere returns to London Colney on Sunday remain to be seen.

In reality, while smoking shouldn’t be condoned, a few drags on a cigarette and a few sips of champagne is unlikely to have a huge set-back on his pre-season preparations. But it certainly will not help, of course.

Social media has been awash with players posting videos and photographs of themselves topping up their fitness over the summer.

Speaking out: Former Gunners chief George Graham has criticised Wilshere's behaviour

When you work in an industry where finding an edge over a rival is paramount, Wilshere — and more importantly, Wenger — knows that edge is not found at the bottom of a champagne glass.

‘Arsene Wenger is the right man to deal with it, he wants a person to not only train well and eat well, but behave well,’ continued Graham on talkSPORT on Tuesday.

‘After the bad publicity shots in the newspapers, somebody has got to have a word with him and I think Arsene Wenger will do.

‘His career has not gone anywhere in the last 18 months. The papers now want any sort of publicity of players misbehaving and he has got to get his act together.’

Wilshere, for so long heralded as the future of Arsenal and England’s midfield, is approaching a critical season.

The 22-year-old was meant to be the mainstay of Arsenal’s engine room for the next 10 years. He is now no longer guaranteed a  starting role. He lost his place in the team on various occasions last  season, though foot and ankle  injuries didn’t help his cause.

Wenger will be the first admit he is now struggling to find Wilshere a regular place in his team. Aaron Ramsey has surpassed him as the club’s premier central midfielder, while Mikel Arteta, Mathieu Flamini and Tomas Rosicky were all preferred to Wilshere at different junctures last season.

Summer signing: The arrival of Alexis Sanchez could restrict Wilshere's chances this season

Wenger’s attempts to sign either Sami Khedira or Lars Bender this summer will make it even harder.

Wilshere sometimes found his way into the team last season by  playing on either flank, but the £30million capture of Alexis Sanchez, as well as the pending return to fitness of Theo Walcott, mean even a place out wide is no longer a certainty. Likewise, his position in Roy Hodgson’s plans are no longer crystal clear.

At one stage, Wilshere’s position alongside Steven Gerrard in  England’s World Cup midfield looked set in stone.

Competition: Wilshere faces a battle for his spot for club and country

But last season’s loss of form, injuries and the emergence of  Jordan Henderson and Adam Lallana meant Wilshere played just 17 minutes of England’s opening two games in Brazil, before he was handed a start in the dead rubber against Costa Rica.

Like Wenger, Hodgson will not have been amused by the pictures of his great midfield hope living it up in the gambling capital of the world.

And, at the moment, Wilshere is gambling with his future.
