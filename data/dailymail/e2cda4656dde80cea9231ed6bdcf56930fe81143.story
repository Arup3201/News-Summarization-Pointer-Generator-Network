It was a miserable 44th birthday for beleaguered Toronto Mayor Rob Ford today as the political inferno surrounding his alleged crack cocaine use continued to burn.

Putting on a friendly face for the massed hordes of reporters who gathered at city hall, Ford handed out slices of a football-themed cake as he was inundated with questions surrounding the resignations of key staff members and a video which allegedly shows him smoking a crack pipe.

And just as his big day could not have gotten any worse, two protesters arrived with their cake for Ford wishing him a happy birthday, but also imploring him to resign.

Anyone for Cake? Toronto Mayor Rob Ford brings cake from his office to offer it members of the media in celebration of his 44th birthday at City Hall in Toronto, May 28, 2013

The two women, Jennifer Capararu and Christine Brubaker explained the acute embarrassment Ford was bringing upon Toronto by singing, 'Happy birthday, Rob Ford! Please resign, Rob Ford! Happy birthday, please resign, please resign Rob Ford.'

Unfortunately for the women who had gone to the trouble of baking another cake for the embattled mayor, security did not allow them to get near to the mayor's office.

The offer of cake to reporters was in stark contrast to his attitude on Friday when Ford, the mayor of Canada's largest city, took to the weekly radio show he hosts with his brother Doug Ford to reiterate that allegations he is seen smoking crack in a video that surfaced on May 16th are ridiculous.

'A bunch of maggots," Ford said about the reporters hounding him, quickly adding that he shouldn't have said that.

Today at City Hall when asked by reporters about the video, Ford simply said, 'I can't comment.'

Earlier this month, Gawker and The Toronto Star published reports and that two journalists had watched a video that appears to show Ford, sitting in a chair, inhaling from what appears to be a glass crack pipe.

The Star said it did not obtain the video or pay to watch it.

Gawker and the Star have said the video was shown to them by a drug dealer who had been trying to sell it for a six-figure sum.

Indeed, on Monday, Gawker raised enough money from its readers, donated through crowdfunding website Indiegogo and nicknamed the 'Crackstarter Fund,' to buy the video from its owner.

But later on during the day, Gawker published an update to say that they were unable to make contact with the owner.

'We have had no further contact with the people we believe to have custody of this video since the last update,' the editor of the site wrote on Indiegogo.

'Our confidence that we can consummate this transaction has diminished.'

Fundraising: On Monday, Gawker successfully raised more than $200,000 in its 'Crackstarter' campaign to purchase the video

Facing the media: Toronto Mayor Rob Ford makes a statement to the press after the resignation of his communications aides George Christopoulos and Isaac Ransom

In fact, the murky affair surrounding what was being viewed as a comic story last week darkened with yesterday's news that one of Ford's senior staffers has now been questioned by police as a possible link to the murder of 21-year-old Anthony Smith.

Sources told the Globe and Mail newspaper that police had spoken to a high-ranking official within the mayor's office as part of an 'ongoing investigation that is currently in the media.'

The paper reported that the staffer reportedly told officers that he claimed to know where the alleged 'crack' video was and that the person who had it may have been murdered for what he knew.

A still image obtained by Gawker and The Toronto Star - allegedly taken from the video -  purportedly shows Ford with two men.

One of them is believed to be Smith, who was gunned down outside at Toronto nightclub last month.

The report comes as Ford's press secretary George Christopoulos and deputy press secretary Isaac Ransom have stepped down amid the uproar.

Additionally, chief of staff Mark Towhey was fired late last week, according to reports.

Rumors: Toronto Mayor Rob Ford (right) said on a talk show hosted by his brother City Councillor Doug Ford that a video of him allegedly smoking crack cocaine does not exist

Furthermore, the Globe and Mail has conducted an in-investigation into Toronto Mayor Rob Ford's background and family and alleges that they were 'once deeply immersed in the illegal drug scene.'

Doug Ford, the mayor's brother who is also a Toronto City Councillor Doug is alleged to have sold hashish in the 1980s, another brother Randy is reported to have been involved in a drug-related kidnapping and Ford's sister Kathy has been alleged to have ties with the KKK.

In the article, it alleges the mayor's brother, Toronto City Councillor Doug, sold large quantities of hashish in the 1980s.

There are no records of him ever having been charged in relation to the alleged drug sale.

The article, that cited 10 anonymous sources, also claimed his brother Randy had been charged in a drug-related kidnapping.

Additionally Ford's sister was named as having connections to the KKK and having been involved in drug related violence.

Ford's brother Doug called the newspaper 'little sleaze bags' and 'a bunch of scums' for going after the family.

'I think it's pretty low, and a bunch of sleazy, sleazy journalism. It has gone to the bottom of the barrel … it makes me sick,' he told a Global News reporter.

Globe's editor-in-chief John Stackhouse defended the piece, telling CBC News that it was 'important to get this on the public record.'

The Globe said that it has been working on the story for several months and decided to go public after Ford's public denial on Friday that he had ever used drugs.

'I do not use crack cocaine, nor am I an addict of crack cocaine,' Toronto Mayor Rob Ford said in a press conference Friday afternoon, after a week of silence since reports of the video emerged.

'As for a video, I cannot comment on a video that I have not seen, or does not exist.'
