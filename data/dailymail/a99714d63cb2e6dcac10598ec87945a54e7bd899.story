A Cincinnati Bengals cheerleader is accusing the team in a lawsuit of violating federal wage laws.

Alexa Brenneman, 24, says in the complaint that cheerleaders put in more than 300 hours attending mandatory practices and charity events and performing required volunteer work.

The lawsuit filed Tuesday says squad members are paid a flat rate of $90 a game for cheering at 10 games during the 2013 season.

It also claims Ms Brenneman was paid $2.85 an hour when the Ohio minimum wage in 2013 was $7.85.

Brenneman is seeking an end to the alleged violations along with unpaid wages, attorney fees and court costs, according to the Cincinnati Enquirer.

The class action also reveals the laundry list of requirements each member of the 24 member cheer squad must adhere to.

The six-page document of 'Cincinnati Ben-Gal Rules' features requirements such as  'No slouching breasts. Support as needed'.

'No panties are to be worn under practice clothes or uniform, not even thong panties' is another rule.

Cheerleaders
 must also submit to 'glamour evaluations' and are put on 'weight 
probation' if their weight fluctuates by more than three pounds.

Alexa Brenneman, 24, says in the complaint that cheerleaders put in more than 300 hours attending mandatory practices and charity events and performing required volunteer work

'If
 you are over your 3 lb leniency weight, you will be required to stay 30
 minutes after practice for extra conditioning,' the rules states.

They are also not allowed to 
associate with the Bengal players at all and the Ben-Gals also are 
required to pose for and promote the Cincinnati Ben-Gals calendar 
without pay while the team makes money off of calendar sales, the suit 
contends.

Bengals spokesman Jack Brennan said: 'The
 Ben-Gals cheerleading program has long been a program run by former 
cheerleaders and has enjoyed broad support in the community and by 
members of the squad.

'The lawsuit appears to be a copycat lawsuit that 
mimics the one filed last month in California against a different NFL 
club. The Bengals will address the litigation in due course.'
