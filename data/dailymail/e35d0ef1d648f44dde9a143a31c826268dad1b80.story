A rare navigator’s watch recovered by a Royal Air Force officer from the underpants of a captured German who had tried to hide it is up for auction.

The timepiece is one of four ‘liberated’ by the officer whose job it was to interrogate German prisoners of war, who often tried to conceal valuable items about their person when first caught.

One airman stuffed his watch in his underpants, hoping his captors would not look there - but the unnamed British officer performed a thorough search and soon recovered the item.

Up for auction: Two of the four watches which were 'liberated' by the officer whose job it was to interrogate German prisoners of war, who often tried to conceal valuable items about their person when first caught

Valuable: Two of the timepieces going under the hammer at auctioneers at Charterhouse in Sherborne, Dorset,  are Hanhart pilot’s chronograph watches, made by the famous Swiss watchmaker Johann A. Hanhart

It went along with three other 
Luftwaffe-issue timepieces he acquired during the Second World War. The 
four watches are now being sold at an auction on May 8 with a total 
pre-sale estimate of £8,000.

They
 belong to the son of the late serviceman who inherited them. He said: 
‘My father was an RAF intelligence officer and his job was to 
interrogate German airmen who had been captured.

‘He spoke German and pressed the men for worthwhile information such as the equipment the Luftwaffe were using.

'One prisoner had his watch wrapped around something that wasn’t his wrist because he was so desperate not to lose it'

RAF officer's son

‘He
 had to search them and one prisoner had his watch wrapped around 
something that wasn’t his wrist because he was so desperate not to lose 
it.

‘My father ended up having it and kept it as a souvenir or as part of the spoils of war. When my father died over 20 years ago we had a clear out of his things and acquired his four watches.’

Two of the timepieces are Hanhart pilot’s chronograph watches, made by the famous Swiss watchmaker Johann A. Hanhart. The other two are made by German watchmaker Glashutte.

Historic event: The officer arrived in France 11 days after the D-Day landings in 1944 and interviewed rounded-up German prisoners, which is when it is believed he acquired the four Luftwaffe pilots' watches

Auctioneer Richard Bromell said: ‘The 
vendor’s father, from Manchester, was of Dutch origin and spoke fluent 
French, German, Dutch, and towards the end of the Second World War 
Russian too.’

More than 400,000 German POWs were still being held in Britain one year after the Second World War ended.

One fifth of all farm labour in Britain in 1946 was being done by German POWs, who were also working on roads and building sites.

A ban on the Germans socialising with local populations near the UK camps was lifted towards the end of the year, and many British people invited them in for a family Christmas.

Some 250,000 German POWs had been repatriated by the end of 1947, but 24,000 chose to stay in Britain.

One of them, Hans Siegfried Vallentin, married a girl he met in Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, and they had five children and 11 grandchildren.

Perhaps the most famous POW who settled in England after the war was Bert Trautmann (above), who became a legendary goalkeeper for Manchester City FC. He died last July.

‘As an officer
 in the RAF, and as a linguist, he is believed to have worked in MI19, 
the division formed from MI9 as the enemy prisoner of war interrogation 
department.

‘He
 arrived in France 11 days after the D-Day landings and interviewed 
rounded up German prisoners, which is when it is believed he “acquired” 
these four Luftwaffe pilots’ watches.’

The vendor, who is from the Somerset area, said: ‘If you wind them up they do start to tick but they would need to be repaired as they haven’t been properly used for 70 years. These watches have been locked up in a drawer for many years.

'You can’t go on hoarding things forever and I don’t have any romantic association with them, so I think it is best to pass them on.’

Mr Bromell, of auctioneers Charterhouse in Sherborne, Dorset, which is selling the watches, said: ‘They are four high quality wristwatches used by German pilots and navigators in the war.

‘They need some work doing to them to get them going again. However, with all the watches being quite similar the vendor isn’t sure which one was recovered from the PoW’s underpants.’

The owner’s father worked in Lloyds Bank before the war, and after it had ended he joined the family business which supplied animal feeds.
