Most property listings feature the usual, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, the size of the garden. 

But this one is a little different.  

A woman in Indonesia whose husband has passed away has decided to offer an extra little incentive for buyers interested in her house... her hand in marriage.

Wina Lia, 40, poses outside her house. She is selling the property but has also offered herself up for a potential marriage with it 

Single mother Wina Lia, 40, is selling her house for around £51,000 but she stipulates in her advert that, 'Buyers who don't negotiate the price can ask the owner to marry (terms and conditions apply).'

And although it started as a small ad, the offer has now gone viral. Indeed, Wina's estate agent says that they have been inundated with calls. 

Dian Purna Dirgantara told Time that the advert had been, 'quite successful.' He said: 'Since yesterday morning there are continuous calls, I don't count how many, there must be dozens or even hundreds.'

And he clarified that should they choose, the new owner could buy the property without having to take Wina along with it.

Wina's house - which she is selling for around £51,000 - has two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a fish pond and a parking space

Wina said that she was looking for a husband anyway so didn't mind putting herself in the advert with the house 

'If someone just wants the house, they can have that,' he told TIME.

Wina told her local news site Kompass that she had been hoping to find a new partner anyway. 

She said: 'Dian suggested I put up the tagline ‘Buy the house and marry the owner at the same time.’ And I said O.K. to it. I’m looking for a husband anyway.'  

As well as a potential wife the house has two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a parking space and a fish pond, and is located near the Javanese city of Yogyakarta.
