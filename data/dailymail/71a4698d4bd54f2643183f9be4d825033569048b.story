A father and son were forced to bite a dog and stab it with garden shears when it attacked their pet during a walk in a suburban street.

Luke Shearer, 26, of Coventry, West Midlands, repeatedly stabbed an attacking Staffordshire bull terrier with the tool as he tried desperately to get it to release its grip on his pet husky Sky.

When the Staffie refused to let go even after it had been stabbed, Luke wrestled the dog away by biting the animal on the head.

Luke Shearer was forced to stab and bite a Staffordshire bull terrier after it attacked his husky Sky while he and his father, Derek, were walking their dog in Coventry, West Midlands

The incident happened after the animal broke free while being walked by two children. Luke, who was walking Sky with his father, Derek, said people in the area stood and filmed on their phones rather than helping.

Luke, who suffers from post traumatic stress disorder, said: 'It happened so quick. We were walking to cut my grandma's hedge so we had the shears with us.

'The dog came and jumped at Sky's neck, and it was life or death for my dog, so I just reacted and hit it with what I had.

'My dad was hitting it with his walking stick but that didn't work, so I stabbed it four or five times in the spinal column, but it kept coming. I jumped on it and started biting its face until it let go.

'The kids were terrified, it's not their fault, it's their parents. It's like sending them out with a loaded gun to play with.

'Now I'm worried about the dog, I'm worried it hasn't been taken to a vet to get treatment.'

Beloved family pet Sky is now on medication after the incident, which her owners described as 'pure hell'

He also hit out at the bystanders who filmed on their phones rather than helping.

He said: 'I thought I had broken my arm, they could have called an ambulance or the police but they just filmed.

'What world are we living in where they stand there and film rather than phoning for help? It's irresponsible.'

Three-year-old Sky is now on medication, but will make a full recovery and Luke was released from hospital after his arm was checked.

Luke's father Derek, 59, said: 'It was three minutes of pure hell. People were filming and laughing, not one person helped.

'Luke's cracking up because of what he had to do to that dog. The police need to find the owners.'

A spokesman for West Midlands Police said they are looking into the incident and are trying to trace the owner as a criminal offence may have been committed by allowing the dog off the lead.
