Police investigating the cold-case deaths of women from more than 30 years ago have linked four of them to a convicted triple murderer who authorities say may have been responsible for as many as 26 slayings.

Cops are investigating if Vincent Groves is responsible for 26 murders

District Attorney Mitch Morrissey said Vincent Groves, who died in prison in 1996 at age 42, was tied by DNA to the 1979 killings of women found strangled and partially nude in an alley, an industrial park and a bathtub in Denver.

Police used a DNA profile of Groves they recently found from an old murder investigation and linked it to the three separate crime scenes.

Groves was serving a life sentence for the 1980s strangling of two young women. He had been released on parole in 1987 after serving five years in prison for killing a third woman in suburban Denver.

The 1979 slayings of Emma Jenefor, 25; Joyce Ramey, 23; and Peggy Cuff, 20, bore strong resemblances to Groves’ past killings and the disappearance of a woman that Groves was suspected in, police said.

DNA also linked the 1988 slaying of 35-year-old Pamela Montgomery, whose body was found in an alley, to Groves.

Groves strangled most of his victims; many were found nude or partially clothed, left in the mountains west of Denver, alleys and fields outside the city, police said.

Authorities launched a task force in the late 1980s to investigate a string of slayings after authorities began finding an average of a body a month, all possibly killed by the same person. At that time, Grove was suspected of up to 20 killings between 1979 and 1988, he said.

More DNA testing is pending to determine if Groves is linked to other victims, Morrissey said.

Groves’ DNA profile was recovered from the case file related to 17-year-old Tammy Woodrum.

He returned to prison in 1990 for the slayings of Juanita “Becky” Lovato, 19, and Diane Montoya Mancera, 25.

Police had circumstantial evidence linking Groves to three slayings in the late 1970s, including Ramey, and one missing woman. They also suspected Groves of four additional slayings, including Lovato and Mancera, after his release from prison.
