Jonny Evans and Chris Smalling have rejoined Manchester United’s injury list and are ruled out of Friday’s FA Cup fourth round trip to Cambridge United.

Evans limped out of last weekend’s win at Queens Park Rangers while Smalling is understood to have picked up an injury in training.

However, manager Louis van Gaal expects to have Robin van Persie and Luke Shaw available again for a tie he warns could produce an upset if United do not respect their League Two opponents.

‘It’s always tough to play against teams who are weaker in the players’ minds,’ he said. ‘For example, on Wednesday PSV Eindhoven, the No.1 team in the Netherlands lost against the No.3 of the second division (Roda JC). It shall happen also in the FA Cup. There are always surprises and I hope that we are not the surprise.

‘We prepare the same way and of course it’s maybe in another way because in our minds you believe that we are playing a weaker opponent but it’s not like that. It’s another opponent with another playing style, and if you lose the game you are out.

‘For me it’s not a change or an exception because we prepare our matches the same way as Premier League matches or friendly games. It’s very good that we have a process and the players have adapted to that process already in six months.’

United won away at another League Two side, Yeovil Town, in the last round but Van Gaal expects a more direct, aerial approach from Cambridge - comparing the challenge with last week’s win at QPR.

‘When you see Cambridge and analyse them, they play very direct with long balls,’ he added. ‘They have five or six players above 1m 90cm, so for us it is difficult to defend. That’s why you have to prepare yourself very well. It is not so easy to beat Cambridge United. QPR in the last match is also how Cambridge play.

‘The FA Cup is different more in the atmosphere I think. Here it is very important for the fans and people and players, that’s the difference. OK in Germany it is fantastic when you win the cup but not so like here. Also the attendances are much higher here than in Germany or Spain.

'Of course when you play Barcelona or Atletico Madrid there is always a full crowd but there are not many matches in Germany and Spain like that.’

Van Gaal refused to confirm if Victor Valdes will make his United debut in goal after signing an 18-month deal at Old Trafford, or whether Darren Fletcher will be sold amid interest from West Ham United, West Bromwich Albion and Valencia.

‘He is a Manchester United player, that is the update. Darren Fletcher is the only player who has already won the FA Cup in my selection. He is also my captain, one of the three. That is what I can give. I’m not sure because it is the transfer month.’
