The Patriots won their eighth AFC championship - their sixth under Tom Brady and coach Bill Belichick - yesterday to secure a spot in the Super Bowl.

They will now face the Seattle Seahawks, who won their spot earlier in the day with an amazing comeback performance during overtime, in Arizona in two weeks time. 

Tom Brady threw for three touchdowns and LeGarrette Blount ran in three more to lead the New England Patriots to their 45-7 victory over the Indianapolis Colts.

New England opened a 14-point lead in the first half and then ran away with the game, with three third-quarter touchdowns and another to start the fourth. 

That made it the second-most lopsided game in AFC championship history.

Brady completed 23 of 35 passes for 226 yards. Blount ran 30 times for 148 yards.

Andrew Luck completed 12 of 33 passes for 126 yards with two interceptions for the Colts.

Earlier in the day the Seahawks confirmed their spot with a stunning comeback against Green Bay in the NFC championship game.  

Russell Wilson hit Jermaine Kearse for a 35-yard touchdown, just over three minutes into overtime to lift the Seattle Seahawks to an improbable 28-22 victory. The victory reduced Wilson to tears.

The Seahawks became the first defending champions to make the Super Bowl in 10 years on Sunday, with their eighth straight win. Their opposition, New England, has been the most dominant NFL franchise of the 2000s. 

In reaching the Super Bowl for the eighth time, New England has equalled a record held by the Dallas Cowboys and the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Outplayed for much of Sunday's match, and plagued by five turnovers, the Seahawks trailed 16-7 with 2:09 remaining.

That's when Wilson ran just one yard for a touchdown.

Seattle recovered a bobbled onside kick at the 50 yard line, and Marshawn Lynch sped and powered his way to a 24-yard touchdown.

Wilson's desperate 2-point conversion pass was hauled in by Luke Willson to make it 22-19.

But Aaron Rodgers led the Packers to Mason Crosby's fifth field goal, from 48 yards with 14 seconds to go.

Then Wilson and Kearse struck.

Despite early setbacks, the Seahawks had been favored to take both the game and this year's Superbowl, reported the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, who quoted the oddsmakers line that the Hawks were a 7.5 point favorite to beat Green Bay.

But with the team trailing 19-7 and just five minutes on the clock, some fans started to leave the game early missing the triumphant comeback.

'There's a rule: You never leave a big game early,' wrote Eric Edholm at Yahoo.  

Reaction to the improbable last minute victory quickly spread across social media.

'HELL OF A GAME,' tweeted CJ Spiller. 'Seattle showed why they are the champions wasn't no quit in them congrats Seahawks but also to packers on their season.'

'Does #obamacare cover anxiety disorder from watching the #packersvsseahawks game?' joked analyst Akbar Gbajabiamila.
