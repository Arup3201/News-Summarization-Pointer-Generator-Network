Accused: Gucci heir Guccio Gucci has been arrested for alleged fraud worth 800,000 euros (£650,000)

Gucci heir Guccio Gucci has been arrested for alleged fraud worth 800,000 euros (£650,000).

The Florentine fashion entrepreneur, named after his great grandfather, the world famous fashion label’s founder, is accused of removing hundreds of thousands of pounds from the coffers of his own fashion company to pay off personal debts, before declaring bankruptcy.

Mr Gucci, who worked at the family company for 12 years before leaving in 1989 has been put under house arrest following the seizure of 400,000 euros.

Financial police said Mr Gucci, the owner of the fashion brand TobG, which named a handbag after the Duchess of Cambridge, declared bankruptcy in December after removing 800,000 euros in cash and assets from the company.

According to police he transferred all the assets to a new company with a head office in Perugia.

The investigating magistrate in Florence wrote in the arrest warrant: ‘Gucci, the great-grandson of the founder of the label Gucci, skilfully exploited the goodwill of some individuals with few scruples to pursue his intents.

‘We are not looking at the classic example of problems of a company that has failed because of the crisis. The operation was a complex one and was designed almost entirely to pay off some debts.’

Prosecutor Christine Von Borries said that Gucci acting with another conspirator ‘emptied the coffers of the company so as to render debt collection by the Italian Inland Revenue of 386,000 euros for the years 2007-12 impossible.'

The dynasty has been plagued by rifts and infighting.

In 2012 the fashion heir and his brother Alessandro were sued by Gucci for trademark infringement. The company has also taken legal action against three others members of the families for using their famous name to launch products.

Patriarch Guccio Gucci originally founded the label as a family-owned saddlery and luggage shop in Florence in 1920, later adding handbags.

His son Aldo was convicted of tax fraud in the US in 1986 and served a year in a Florida jail.

Guccio's grandson Maurizio took over as chairman but was accused by his cousins of forgery. In 1995 he was shot dead outside his office. 

His wife Patrizia Gucci, dubbed the Black Widow, served 18 years for his murder before being released last year.
