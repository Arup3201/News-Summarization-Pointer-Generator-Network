It is the biggest smartphone on sale, with a giant 6.3inch screen.

Samsung's new Mega Galaxy handset look more like a tablet than a phone - and has already been slammed as 'just too big'.

Samsung hopes the big design will appeal to commuters and others who regularly watch films on their gadgets.

Samsung Mega Galaxy, which boasts a huge 6.3inch screen and is believed to be the largest smartphone on the market

Analysts have deemed a 'phablet' is a mobile gadget with a screen more than 5inches diagonally.

The word comes from blending phone and tablet.

Samsung's Galaxy Note was the first popular 'phablet', but others are expected to follow this year.

Shipments of gadgets that are 5 inches or bigger in screen size will 
surge by nearly nine-fold to 228 million during the same period, though 
estimates vary because no one can agree on where smartphones stop and 
phablets start.

'The newest addition to the Galaxy family balances an optimal viewing
experience on a 6.3-inch HD screen, yet is ultra-thin and portable 
enough to put into a pocket or hold in one hand,' the firm said.

'The GALAXY Mega offers a mix of popular smartphone and tablet 
features such as an effortless user experience, a split screen, 
multitasking between video and other apps and more.'

It claims video and web browsing will be the main uses for the Mega.

'We are aware of a great potential in the bigger screen for extensive
viewing multimedia, web browsing, and more,' said JK Shin of Samsung.

'We are excited to provide another choice to meet our consumersâ€™ 
varying lifestyles, all while maintaining the high-quality features of 
the award-winning GALAXY series.'

However, experts are less impressed.

Rik Henderson of Pocket Lint said 'The screen size of the Galaxy Note works as you take notes - but the Mega is just a massive phone, it's just too big.

'However, I think we'll see an arms race to get to that size, there's a real blurring of the lines between phones and tablets now.

'But for consumers, I think its a fad - it's just too big.'

Samsung helped popularise the so-called 'phablet' category - in which
phones approach tablet dimensions - with its original 5.3in Galaxy 
Note, which was released in 2011.

Analysts have deemed a 'phablet' is a mobile gadget with a screen more than 5inches diagonally.

A phone too far? The Samsung Galaxy Note smartphone was the first 'phablet' but now an even bigger version has been launched

Samsung's Galaxy Note was the first popular 'phablet', but others are expected to follow this year.

Experts have predicted that 2013 could be the year of the 'phablet'.

Analysts claim the emergence of so-called 'giant mobile' which blend 
tablets and mobile phones, will lead to a whole new category of gadgets.

The upshot is a market for phablets that will quadruple in value to $135
billion in three years, according to analysts at Barclays.

Shipments of gadgets that are 5 inches or bigger in screen size will 
surge by nearly nine-fold to 228 million during the same period, though 
estimates vary because no one can agree on where smartphones stop and 
phablets start.

But that's the point, some say.

'I think phone size was a preconceived notion based on voice usage,' 
said John Berns, a Singapore-based executive who works in the 
information technology industry.

Experts warn the giant phone could be 'just a fad' for consumers, and claim it is simply too large to use as an everyday handset
