Gary Neville finds himself at the centre of controversy over approaching a player to join Salford City, the non-League team he co-owns with his Class of ’92 colleagues from Manchester United.

Neville, who launches his takeover with brother Phil, Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes when the quintet and friends play a match against Salford on August 7, made a telephone call to Lee Gaskell, a prolific goalscorer for Northern League rivals Ramsbottom United.

However, Gaskell, whose Ramsbottom side were promoted to the Evo-Stik League Premier, a division above Salford, decided not to move despite Neville’s intervention.

Ramsbottom manager Anthony Johnson said: ‘Lee told us he’d had a call from Gary Neville. We assumed he’d been picked for England. Lee could easily have had his head turned when someone so well known gets involved.

‘We were surprised as it’s not the way we’re used to doing business at this level of the game. Managers phone each other and ask to speak to players and Phil Power, the Salford manager, told us he knew nothing about Neville’s intervention. But thankfully Lee prefers to stay with us and play at a higher level next season.’

A spokeswoman for the Class of ’92 said Neville, who hadn’t talked money, only contacted Gaskell as he knows the family through Gaskell’s mother working for United at their Carrington training ground.

Gaskell would earn less than £100 a week expenses with Ramsbottom, but Salford strongly dispute claims that they will be buying their way into the Football League.

Louis van Gaal, the new hardline manager of Manchester United, has made it clear on the pre-season trip to the United States that once the programme for the day has been rubber-stamped by him it cannot be altered.

This includes sponsorship and media appearances. So when US radio network Sirius, who enjoy a close relationship with former manager Sir Alex Ferguson, wanted to interview players without LVG’s permission, it didn’t happen.

The ludicrous two-faced Piers Morgan described your Sports Agenda columnist on Tuesday as the ‘most hideously awful creature in sports journalism history’. Yet the last time I saw him face to face in Melbourne before his battering by Brett Lee, he told me how much he liked this column.

The FA may have swept referee chief David Elleray’s racist comment about an FA employee under the Wembley carpet.

But at least by keeping the issue in the public eye, Sports Agenda has ensured that every member of the 121-strong FA council — criticised by FA chairman Greg Dyke for being ‘overwhelmingly white and male and increasingly irrelevant’ — has to undergo diversity and equality training.

Not so fantastic, Mike

Mike Hooper, Commonwealth Games Federation chief executive, somehow described weightlifting as a ‘fantastic sport’ just after announcing that yet another weightlifter had failed a drugs test — Nigeria’s 53kg gold medallist Chika Amalaha, aged 16 — after traces of diuretics and masking agents were found in an in-competition test.

Weightlifting has been responsible for more drug offences than any other Olympic or Commonwealth Games disciplines yet when asked how much longer it can remain a core event of the Games, Hooper gave his eulogy while also praising the anti-doping programme.

It has often been said that the atmosphere at a football ground suffers with a running track around the pitch.

Hampden Park may be Scotland’s national football stadium but the low-slung design — compared to towering Wembley — makes it much better for athletics — as the Commonwealth Games have shown.

But the pity for track and field is that the picture-perfect venue will be no more when the track built on stilts at a cost of £14m is dismantled after Sunday’s closing ceremony.
