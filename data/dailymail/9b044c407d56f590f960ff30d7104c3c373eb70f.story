Legendary Italy striker Antonio Di Natale has revealed Liverpool are the only team he would have left Udinese to play for, and he almost did in 2008 when Rafael Benitez was manager.

Now approaching the twilight of his years as one of Serie A's most lethal finishers, Di Natale, 37, said he spoke to Liverpool in 2008 as team-mate Andrea Dossena secured a move to Anfield.

'When Andrea Dossena signed in 2008, Liverpool spoke with me, but it all came to nothing,' Di Natale told Sportweek magazine in Italy.

'Udinese taught me work ethic and respect. The only other team I would have loved to play for, for the atmosphere and the stadium, is Liverpool,' he added. 

Four years later, Di Natale captained Udinese and scored in their 3-2 victory at Anfield against Liverpool under Brendan Rodgers.

Di Natale, who scored 11 times in 42 games for Italy, nearly called time on his career last season but changed his mind, and is now chasing his 200th Italian league goal.
