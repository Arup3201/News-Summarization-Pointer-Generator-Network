For most football fans, the ultimate display of loyalty to their team is a tattoo sporting the side's colours or crest.

But one Newcastle United fan has taken his love for the Geordie club to new extremes.

Andrew Canavan has had the club's emblem etched onto his glass eye in a bid to find a unique way to show where his loyalties lie.

Unusual request: Mr Canavan had to get special permission to use the club's trademarked crest

The 35-year-old spent a year trying to secure permission from Newcastle United to use their logo - a registered trademark - before finally getting the go ahead this summer.

The glass eye, made by a specialist in Blackpool for just over Â£150, arrived at his home in Bishop Auckland, County Durham, earlier this week and Andrew says he is 'over the moon' with the creation.

The demolition worker plans to wear the glass eye everyday and says he has had a brilliant reaction from friends and family.

However, he adds that he's had some 'grief' from rival fans for taking his love of Newcastle to the extreme.

He said: 'I've had some snide comments from Sunderland fans on Facebook, but that is only to be expected.

'When some people lose an eye they are devastated, but I saw it as an opportunity to do something unique.

'I have always been a Newcastle United fan. Where I come from, you don't choose what club you support, you are born into it.

'My dad was a Newcastle fan, and my granddad.

'This is the ultimate tribute to Newcastle United.'

Andrew, a father-of-three, added: 'It took us ages to persuade Newcastle United to allow me to use the emblem because it is a registered trademark.

'To start with they thought I was taking the mick, but when they realised how sincere I was they said they were happy for me to go ahead.'

The football fanatic's baby Delly, nineteen-months-old, has been pointing and laughing at the eye since he started wearing it on Monday.

He said that his step-children Chloe, who is eight, and Jay, who is six, also think the etching is 'pretty cool'.

Andrew's partner Emma Tray, 30, added: 'This does not surprise me at all. It is exactly the kind of mad thing Andrew would do.'

Andrew had his eye removed 20 years ago when a detached retina caused bleeding from his pupil which turned his eye red.

He was told by a doctor that he could keep the eye, but he made the decision to have it removed.

Andrew added: 'I jumped at the chance to have it taken out, it was doing my head in.

'I couldn't be happier with my glass eye.'

A spokesperson for Newcastle United said: 'It was certainly an unusual request but one that we were more than happy to assist with.'
