Taylor Swift had the crowd begging for more.

The Red singer made her very first appearance at the MuchMusic Video Awards in Toronto one to remember on Sunday - and ended up winning the 'Fave International Artist of the Year' award for her song, 22.

Taylor knocked everyone out at the city's biggest block party by showing up in a clingy black-and-white patterned bandage dress that left no curve hidden.
