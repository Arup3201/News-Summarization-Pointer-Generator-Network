It's one of Melbourne's most iconic pieces of property.

Brighton beaches' latest bathing box is up for auction next month, the first of Bayside council's newly built weatherboard-clad structures for sale.

Box 57a, covered in a variety of beach blues, is the ultimate luxury for south east Melbourne residents who want a bit of protection from the elements, the first new one sold for the summer season. 

A definite money spinner for council, the cost of building them is believed to only come to around the $15,000 to $20,000 mark but if you want to buy them you could be in for more than $200,000.

'The prices have ranged,' said Hockingstuart real estate agent John Clarkson,'we have achieved in the excess of $200,000 but lately it's dropped back a little to between $160,000 to $200,000.'

But this new release, he expects will hit the $200,000 plus mark when it goes to auction, with the plus being there is no neighbour, with a gap before the next box.

'It's a summer sensation, a great christmas present,' he said. 

While bathing boxes date back many years, Mr Clarkson was the first to sell one by private auction in 1999.

'Used to just have a number of people on a name and list,' he said, 'at the first auction it sold for $58,000.'

The last box he sold was in February for $175,000 and had been in the same family for 40 years.

Bathing boxes are an icon at Brighton beach in Melbourne south east

Bayside residents are the only one that can purchase the iconic bathing boxes, which shelters them from all the elements on Brighton beach

'They're iconic, there's only 86 of them, you have to be a Bayside ratepayer to make a purchase.'

He says the colourful wonders have been 'world famous' and some families keep the traditional going for decades.

'(residents)Really protective of them, and so few opportunities to buy,' he said.

'They're very well known to people all over the world, there's so many pictures and paintings across the world.' 

Mr Clarkson expects buyer interest will vary on the day of the auction, depending on the weather.

How about that view? Situated right on the beach bathing boxes are very popular but also very expensive to buy

Bathing boxes come with a great view and nearby harbour

'It's weather pacific as to whether we get a good crowd.'

'Last one I had it was bucketing down and we crammed 40 people in the box, another one was in total sunshine and we had about 200 on the beach.' 

Proceeds from the sale will go back into the foreshore, used to fund improvements to the Dendy beach precinct.

The iconic property goes under the hammer on December 13.
