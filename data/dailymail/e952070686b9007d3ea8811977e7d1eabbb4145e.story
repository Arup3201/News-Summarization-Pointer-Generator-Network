A Montana toddler drowned after tipping headfirst into a five-gallon mop bucket, police said today.

Marielle Dalimata, of Creston, died on Saturday night, ten days before her first birthday. 

Flathead County Sheriff Chuck Curry said there is nothing to indicate the death of the little girl is anything but an accident.  

Marielle Dalimata drowned in a five-gallon mop bucket on Saturday night at her home in Montana, days before her first birthday 

The little girl died days before her first birthday in an accidental drowning at her home in Montana, police said on Tuesday

The girl's body was taken to the state crime lab in Missoula for an autopsy. 

Brook Schwab, the girl's aunt, told the Daily Inter Lake that the family is devastated. 

She said the baby's parents, Mark and Kayla Dalimata, wanted to remind all parents of young children how quickly a drowning can happen and to not leave children alone around water, even momentarily.

'We were planning to have a birthday party. We weren’t planning to have funeral expenses,' Schwab told the local paper, adding that the little girl was unattended 'for not even four minutes.'

The parents and first responders tried to resuscitate Marielle. She was pronounced dead at the hospital in Kalispell.

The family, who are believed to have an older son, have set up a gofundme page to help cover the toddler's funeral expenses. 

Drowning is the leading cause of injury-related death for children aged one to four. Three children each day die from drowning, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
