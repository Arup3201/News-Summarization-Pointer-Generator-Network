Far from just plonking a squirrel feeder in the back garden, Steven Barley's elaborate set-up not only entices local wildlife  but makes them stars of his hit web videos.

Writer and teacher Barley's latest creation is the Grand National, or 'Grand Nut-ional', featuring three of the little creatures in a race along an obstacle course hanging at his Hertfordshire home.

'The obstacles started out as a way to cut down on the amount of nuts the squirrels were eating and went from there,' Barley, dubbed the 'Squirrel Man of Hitchin' on YouTube, tells MailOnline. 

'First it was a bird feeder on the end of the washing line but it's become more and more advanced.'

His previous 'cheeky squirrel' videos have been viewed over one million times and feature, along with the squirrels, 50-year-old Barley's witty, pun-filled commentary.

'I wanted to do something different for the new one and had always wanted to do a race, so I thought why not the most famous race in the world, the Grand National,' he says.

Filmed in October, Barley found time over the Christmas break to edit his patiently compiled footage of Ninja Nutcase and Lady Bobtail as they take on the five obstacle course, including a water jump - Lord Greystroke showed promise but shied away from the jumps. 

While the squirrels look more than willing to take on the course, that's largely thanks to Barley's clever method of introducing his little mates to the jumps made out of 'quality junk' from around his house including pan scourers, plastic spoons.

'I gradually move the nuts along the course so when they come to it they have a new challenge, but they're very clever and work it out quickly,' he says.

The two squirrels finally reach their prize - and endless supply of nuts right at the end of the run

The teacher even set up a model to wave the flag to signal the beginning of the race

Barley stresses while in a sense he's training them to do the course, he would never hand feed them. 

'I'd never do anything to harm them and they're not doing anything more than they would in the wild,' he says. 'But they are a great source of entertainment for us.'
