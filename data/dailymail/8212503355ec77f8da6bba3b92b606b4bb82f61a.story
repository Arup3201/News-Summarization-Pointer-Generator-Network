The U.S. has identified five men who 
might be responsible for the attack on the diplomatic mission in 
Benghazi, Libya, last year, and has enough evidence to justify seizing 
them by military force as suspected terrorists, officials say.

But there isn't enough proof to try them in a U.S. civilian court as the Obama administration prefers.

The men remain at large while the FBI 
gathers evidence. But the investigation has been slowed by the reduced 
U.S. intelligence presence in the region since the September 11, 2012, 
attacks, and by the limited ability to assist by Libya's 
post-revolutionary law enforcement and intelligence agencies, which are 
still in their infancy since the overthrow of dictator Moammar 
Gaddafi.

The decision not to seize the men 
militarily underscores the White House aim to move away from hunting 
terrorists as enemy combatants and holding them at the military prison 
in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

The preference is toward a process in which 
most are apprehended and tried by the countries where they are living or
 arrested by the U.S. with the host country's cooperation and tried in 
the American criminal justice system.

Using military force to detain the men
 might also harm fledgling relations with Libya and other 
post-Arab-Spring governments with whom the U.S. is trying to build 
partnerships to hunt al-Qaeda as the organization expands throughout the
 region.

A senior administration official said 
the FBI has identified a number of individuals that it believes have 
information or may have been involved, and is considering options to 
bring those responsible to justice.Â 

But taking action in remote eastern 
Libya would be difficult. America's relationship with Libya would be 
weighed as part of those options, the official said, speaking only on 
condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to 
discuss the effort publicly.

The Libyan Embassy did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Waiting to prosecute suspects instead 
of grabbing them now could add to the political weight the Benghazi case
 already carries.

The attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission killed 
Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans - information management officer Sean Smith, and former Navy 
SEALs Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods - weeks before 
President Obama's re-election.

Since then, Republicans in 
Congress have condemned the administration's handling of the situation, 
criticizing the level of embassy security, questioning the talking 
points provided to U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice for her public appearances
 to explain the attack and suggesting the White House tried to play down
 the incident to minimize its effect on the president's campaign.

The FBI released photos of three of 
the five suspects earlier this month, asking the public to provide more 
information on the men pictured.

The images were captured by security 
cameras at the U.S. diplomatic post during the attack, but it took weeks
 for the FBI to see and study them.

It took the agency three weeks to 
get to Libya because of security problems, so Libyan officials had to 
get the cameras and send them to U.S. officials in Tripoli, the capital.

The FBI and other U.S. intelligence 
agencies identified the men through contacts in Libya and by monitoring 
their communications.

They are thought to be members of Ansar 
al-Shariah, the Libyan militia group whose fighters were seen near the 
U.S. diplomatic facility prior to the violence.

Republican lawmakers continue to call 
for the Obama administration to provide more information about the 
attack.

The White House released 99 pages of emails about the talking 
points drafted by the intelligence community that Rice used to describe 
the attack, initially suggesting they were part of a series of regional 
protests about an anti-Islamic film.

In those emails, administration 
officials agreed to remove from the talking points all mentions of 
terror groups such as Ansar al-Shariah or al-Qaeda, because the 
intelligence pointing to those groups' involvement was still unclear and
 because some officials didn't want to give Congress ammunition to 
criticize the administration.

U.S. officials say the FBI has proof 
that the five men were either at the scene of the first attack or 
somehow involved because of intercepts of at least one of them bragging 
about taking part.

Some of the men have also been in contact with a 
network of well-known regional Jihadists, including al-Qaeda in the 
Islamic Maghreb.

The U.S. has decided that the evidence
 it has now would be enough for a military operation to seize the men 
for questioning, but not enough for a civilian arrest or a drone strike 
against them, the officials said.

The U.S. has kept them under 
surveillance, mostly by electronic means.

Burning issue: Ambassador Chris Stevens and 
three other Americans were killed in a six-hour, commando-style attack 
on the consulate in Benghazi

There was a worry that the men
 could get spooked and hide, but so far, not even the FBI's release of 
surveillance video stills has done that.

FBI investigators are hoping for more 
evidence, such as other video of the attack that might show the suspects
 in the act of setting the fires that ultimately killed the ambassador 
and his communications specialist, or firing the mortars hours later at 
the CIA base where the surviving diplomats took shelter - or a Libyan 
witness willing to testify against the suspects in a U.S. courtroom.

But Rep Howard P. 'Buck' McKeon, the 
Republican chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said he is 
concerned the Obama administration is treating terrorism as criminal 
actions instead of acts of war that would elicit a much harsher response
 from the United States.

'The war on terror, I think, is a war 
and at times I get the feeling that the administration wants to treat it
 as a crime,' McKeon said Tuesday.

Administration officials have indicated recently that the FBI is zeroing in.

Tragedy: Chris Stevens (pictured in April 2011) became 
the U.S. ambassador to Libya in June 2012. He was killed along with 
three other Americans in an attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi on 
Sept. 11, 2012

'Regardless of what happened 
previously, we have made very, very, very substantial progress in that 
investigation,' Attorney General Eric Holder told lawmakers last week.

That echoed comments made by Secretary of State John Kerry to lawmakers last month.

'They do have people ID'd,' Kerry said
 of the FBI-led investigation. 'They have made some progress. They have a
 number of suspects who are persons of interest that they are pursuing 
in this and building cases on.'

But options for dealing with the men 
are few and difficult, U.S. officials said, describing high level 
strategy debates among White House, FBI and other counterterror 
officials.

Those confidential discussions were described on condition of
 anonymity by four senior U.S. officials briefed on the investigation 
into the attack.

The U.S. could ask Libya to arrest the
 suspects, hoping that Americans would be given access to question them 
and that the Libyans gather enough evidence to hold the men under their 
own justice system.

Another option is to ask the Libyans to extradite 
the men to the U.S., but that would require the U.S. to gather enough 
solid evidence linking the suspects to the crime to ask for such an 
action.
