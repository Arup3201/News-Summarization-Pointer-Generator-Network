A police community support officer has been left devastated after arriving at the scene of a fatal crash and discovering the 10-year-old victim was her nephew.

PCSO Lisa Crocker, 39, was on duty when she was called to the collision involving her young nephew Samuel Crocker in Crediton, Devon.

The 'generous and kind' schoolboy was knocked down as he walked into the town centre to visit a friend on Saturday afternoon.

He was taken to Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital in Exeter but later died from his injuries. His family said a 'bright light had been extinguished'.

Cameron Trivett, 24, of Crediton, has been charged with causing death by careless driving and failing to stop after a collision. He will appear at Exeter Crown Court later this month.

It has now emerged that Mrs Crocker, who is part of Devon and Cornwall Police's neighbourhood team in Crediton, arrived at the scene to discover the victim was her brother's son.

Chief Inspector Matt Lawler said: 'Clearly this is an absolute tragedy for the entire family.

'No-one in the force knew the connection until Lisa arrived at the scene and recognised Samuel.

'There has been a great deal of support locally for Lisa and many local people have been asking if she was personally connected to the incident.

'In order to allow her to focus on supporting her family, Lisa has asked us to confirm her involvement and thereby end the speculation.

'While she has been inundated with messages, Lisa would like everyone to focus on Samuel, not on her connection to the events of last Saturday.'

Emergency services were called to the scene of the crash at about 1.30pm on Saturday after Samuel was struck by the white Vauxhall Combo van.

Following his death, his family led an outpouring of tributes to him.

In a statement, they said: 'On Saturday afternoon our life was turned upside down when our darling Samuel was knocked down while on his way to visit his friend.

'Later that night the bright light that was Samuel was extinguished.

'We all miss our little 'mole' so much and can't begin to imagine how we move on from the devastating situation we are in now.

'Someone so small has left a massive hole that can never be filled, but he will always be remembered for his cheeky, fun-loving nature and we are grateful to have had him in our lives, albeit for such a short time.'

A book of condolence has since been opened at Landscore Primary School where Samuel was a pupil.

Gary Read, the school's headteacher, said: 'Samuel was a truly decent young boy - honest, attentive, generous, loyal and kind.

'To be taken from his family and friends in this way feels incomprehensible.'

Hundreds of people also attended a candle lit vigil at Holy Cross Church on Monday in memory of the youngster.

Reverend Nigel Guthrie, Rector of Crediton, said: 'We wanted to give people a chance to express their feelings about what happened to Samuel.

'It's a huge shock to the whole community as the family are so well-known and loved.

'There has been a very large response and we hope it can help bring everyone together in the wake of it.'

The Bishop of Crediton, Rt. Reverend Nick McKinnel, added: 'This is terribly sad news and my heart goes out to the family of this young boy and to his friends at school.'

Terry Keen, who lives next-door to the Crocker family, also paid tribute.

He said: 'They are a wonderful, local family who have lived here for some time. He was a terrific young boy.

'We would often see him playing out the back, practising his basketball. He was getting very good at it.

'He went to Landscore School with his older brother. We do not know much about what happened.'

Devon and Cornwall Police confirmed the coroner had been informed of the death.
