Jealous: Geoffrey Pearson, 45, has been jailed after he attacked his ex-partner with a claw hammer after she told him she was seeing someone else

A jealous father who attacked his ex-partner with a hammer because she had started a relationship with another man has been jailed.

Geoffrey Pearson attacked Helen Crozier on the doorstep of her home in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, after she told him she was seeing someone else.

Newcastle Crown Court heard the 45-year-old had aimed the clawed weapon at the mother's head, but she was able to put up her hand to fend off the blows.

The 46-year-old victim suffered a puncture wound to the hand as well as a bruised and swollen legs.

Pearson, of Hartlepool, who has a conviction for violence on a previous partner, pleaded guilty to assault and was jailed for eight months, as Judge Sean Morris told him that it was 'pure luck' the victim did not suffer more serious injury.

Neil Pallister, prosecuting, told the court Pearson had turned up at Miss Crozier’s door on May 23 after the pair had rowed over the phone.

'He appeared to be in a rage,' said Mr Pallister.

'She was grabbed by the throat by the defendant. He pulled her with a lot of force, making it hard for her to breathe.

'He then let go of her and she saw he was holding a hammer.

'He said "I’m going to put this in your head" and he began swinging the hammer towards her head.

'She managed to put her arm up to try and protect her face.

'She tried to close the door.

'He hit her leg with the hammer a number of times and she managed to slam the door.'

The court heard Pearson banged at the door with the weapon demanding to be let in while Miss Crozier contacted the police.

Mr
 Pallister added: 'He said he had thought there was a chance they may 
get back together but two weeks ago she told him she had met someone 
else and that made him angry.

'He wanted to know who the male was.'

The court heard Pearson is 'regretful and repentant' and had 'lost all rational thought' when he carried out the attack.

Sentencing, Judge Morris told Pearson: 'You could have killed her.'

He was also ordered to stay away from Miss Crozier for the next five years under the terms of a restraining order.

'You are clearly someone who thinks they are entitled to control women,' said Judge Morris.

'What you did on this day was wholly unforgivable.

'Your former partner is entitled to see whoever she likes, whenever she likes. It is not up to you to decide what she does with her life.'
