Police believe they have found the body of missing teenager Jayden Parkinson in a cemetery in Oxfordshire

The father of murdered teenager Jayden Parkinson says he wants to bring her killer to justice.

Writing on his Facebook page, Paul Parkinson, the father of 17-year-old Jayden, paid tribute to his daughter whose body was discovered by police in a churchyard after she went missing

He said: 'Baby I hope god will look after you now. I will do everything in my power to get whoever has done this to you.

'I am so so sorry baby for letting you down but I will get everybody for you angel I swear that on my life.'

At a press conference this morning, officers said that the teenager's family were 'heartbroken and devastated' at the loss of their daughter.

Jayden went missing more than two weeks ago when she was last seen leaving Didcot railway station, Oxfordshire, at around 4.30pm on December 3.

Her body was found last night in the 
Great Western Cemetery next to All Saint's church where police said 
there was ‘evidence of recent and unauthorised disturbance’

Tests will now take place to establish the cause of death after Jayden’s body was removed from the scene yesterday evening.

The
 officer leading the investigation, Detective Chief Superintendent Andy 
Murray, today said: 'We had prepared Jayden's family for the worst but 
I'm afraid nothing can prepare you for the loss of your child.

'They remain heartbroken, they remain devastated, and our thoughts are with them at this time.'

Mr Murray said formal identification had not yet taken place.

In a brief statement at Thames Valley Police HQ in Kidlington, near Oxford, Mr Murray said: 'It’s been a long and difficult night but, as you probably know, we discovered a body in a particular grave in All Saints’ Cemetery in Didcot and I believe that body to be Jayden Parkinson, our missing teenager.

'Formal identification has not yet taken place. Jayden’s body was removed from the cemetery late last night.

'Our only work in that cemetery now consists of returning that cemetery to its previous state.

'A post-mortem will take place today 
to try and determine how Jayden died and our management of various crime
 scenes in and around Didcot will be dependent on the outcome of that 
post-mortem.'

Mr Murray added: 'I’d like to thank the public for all their support and 
I’d like to thank you, the media, for your help in this case.

'This is likely to be the last time I make any public comment before the outcome of the trial.'

Following the discovery of the body police scaled down their investigation at the graveyard. Officers were seen removing shovels, rakes and bins, putting them onto a police trailer.

Forensics teams left at around 11am and bags were also put into a white van. Silver metal railings used to line the search area with blue tarpaulin were dismantled while a workman turned up with a delivery of soil on a low loader.

It was transferred on wheelbarrows and delivered to the grave site.

Friends of the teenager gathered at the Didcot Train youth project, which Jayden had attended, to remember her.

Youth
 worker Paul Gander said: 'The staff and volunteers at Train knew Jayden
 and are deeply saddened about the events in regard to her. We are 
committed to praying for her and her friends and family at this time, 
and will continue to find ways to care for those whom we know are 
affected by this.

'We wanted to do something, as we know young people are finding it difficult at the moment.'

The vicar of All Saints Church, Rev Karen Beck, said the church would be open for mourners to pay their respects today.

She said: 'It's a very sad time for Jayden's family and my thoughts are with them particularly as we are nearing Christmas.

'Her
 friends are also struggling to come to terms with her loss. If I can 
man the church with volunteers and I'm sure I can I would like for 
people to come down and light candles and say a pray for Jayden from 
9am.'

Jayden's ex-boyfriend Ben Blakeley, 22, appeared in court earlier this week charged with her murder.

A team of more 
than 100 officers and detectives, backed by specialists from the 
National Crime Agency, has spent much of the past week carrying out 
searches at several sites in and around Didcot and the nearby village of
 Upton.

On Tuesday, Mr 
Murray said police had received 'significant and highly relevant 
information' which led police to focus their efforts on a specific grave
 in the cemetery.

The teenager was last seen leaving Didcot railway station at 4.27pm on December 3.

Police
 said there was 'no indication' she was still alive, revealing Jayden 
had not used her mobile phone or accessed her bank account in the days 
since she had been reported missing.

Officers
 had previously issued an appeal for information about a man seen 
struggling with a suitcase just outside Upton at about 2am on Monday, 
December 9.

Police said the information they had received had led their search efforts to a specific grave

Investigation leader Mr Murray said there was evidence at the graveyard of 'recent and unauthorised disturbance'

A search of farmland on the outskirts of the village took place following the sighting.

Officers
 said the same man was seen with the same suitcase in the Lydalls Road 
area of Didcot - where All Saints is located - at about 3.30am the same 
day.

Detectives have since recovered several suitcases, one of which 'may well be significant', according to Mr Murray.

Jayden, who was nicknamed Tiny by her
 mother, had moved out of her family home in Didcot ‘a matter of weeks’ 
before she vanished from a youth hostel in Oxford called 1 Foot Forward.

Superintendent
 Christian Bunt said there had been ‘no bust up’ with her family or 
friends to trigger her out-of-character disappearance.

The
 youngster left school last summer after taking her GCSEs and was not 
believed to be studying or in employment at the time of her 
disappearance.

She was
 said to have often changed her hair colour. Until recently, she had 
lived with her mother, Samantha Shrewsbury, and her sister in Didcot.

Police also confirmed that during the course of their investigation it was 
suggested Jayden might have been pregnant at the time of her 
disappearance.

In a 
statement issued after Jayden's former boyfriend appeared in court 
accused of murder, Mr Murray said: 'During the course of the 
investigation there has been some suggestion that Jayden may be 
pregnant.

'At this time we simply don't have any way of confirming whether this is correct or not.'

Police officers were using sniffer dogs around the graveyard in residential areas

In a 
post on Facebook on Sunday, Jayden's mother Ms Shrewsbury wrote: 
'My baby, my princess, my heart is so heavy baby girl.

'I
 just want to see you walk through my door with a "ta-dar". I need you 
little lady, my heart feels so empty without you you know.'

All Saints' Church said in a statement 
posted on its website: 'We at All Saints' Church are co-operating with 
the police in their inquiries in every possible way at this time.

'We are praying for Jayden's family and friends at this very distressing time.'

Blakeley, of
 Reading, has been charged with her murder and perverting the course of 
justice and is due to appear at Oxford Crown Court for a plea hearing on
 March 17 next year.

A 
17-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has also been 
charged with perverting the course of justice between December 3 and 
December 10 by assisting in the disposal of Jayden's body and other 
evidence.
