Miss Nebraska may not have won the crown at this year's Miss America pageant, but she certainly left a lasting impression on viewers when she accidentally flashed the audience during the live broadcast.

Megan Swanson, 21, of Omaha, Nebraska, was seated directly behind host Chris Harrison when she leaned over to chat with one of her fellow contestants at the start of  the evening wear portion of the competition Sunday evening, and forgot to keep her legs together, giving all of America a look up her short black skirt.

Luckily, she was wearing underwear.

From there, it was only a matter of time before #missnebraska started to trend on Twitter.

The music student, who attends Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee, seems unfazed by the incident however, and failed to mention anything about her little mishap earlier today when she wrote a message to her fans expressing how happy she was to have competed for the title of Miss America.

'Regardless of not being selected to be in the judges top 16 last night, I cannot describe how immeasurably transformational the last two weeks have been for my life,' the Cornhusker State rep said on Instagram. 

'The 52 other women in my class are THE greatest women in the world- beautiful, driven, passionate, God-fearing, and impacting the world on a daily basis. I felt more beautiful than I think I ever have in my entire life, and I was ready to rock my lifestyle and swimsuit on national television- a feat I would have NEVER EVER has the courage to do a year ago. God is good ALL the time, and I will forever remember the experience on a positive note.' 

No worries here: Swanson (above) expressed how happy she was to compete in the pageant on her Instagram today, and made no comment about her little wardrobe malfunction

There she is: Miss New York Kira Kazantsev was crowned the new Miss America

Swanson, who sang for the talent portion of the evening, says on the Miss America site that her goal in life is to 'become a motivational speaker and singer-songwriter.'

Miss New York Kira Kazantsev was ultimately crowned the new Miss America.
