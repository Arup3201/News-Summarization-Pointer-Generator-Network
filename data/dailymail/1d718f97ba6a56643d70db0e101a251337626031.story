A video has emerged which shows a skateboarder jumping all the way across the tracks of a New York City subway platform.

Skateboarder Koki Loaiza jumped across the 145th street platform in Harlem, Gothamist reported.

The stunt was included in Colin Read's film 'Tengu: God of Mischief.'

Up in the air! Loiaza flies across the tracks

He does it! Loiaza sticks the dangerous landing

'We waited till about 5am to get this trick but it was worth it,' Read - who also goes by the name MandibleClaw -  wrote on his website last year.

'I wasn’t sure Koki was going to do it when we went down, but after a few run ups he landed it first try.'

Photographer Allen Ying stood on tracks to capture a mid-jump photograph of Loiaza, he told Daily Intelligencer last year. 

'I knew I was facing where the train was going to come from,' he said. 'There weren't a lot of tries.'

'People online have been saying he should've come from the other side, so he wasn't going toward the third rail, but it would have been impossible,' Ying also said. 'We had scouted the subway pretty well. This spot is probably the only one where that was doable.'

Ying also said that onlookers witnessed Loaiza's feat.

'There were a mix of people who were worried and scared and excited,' he told Daily Intelligencer. 'People who ride the subway that late don't have much else to excite them.'
