It is an insightful, and at times terrifying insight into the maind of the average American.

A new map has revealed what each state uses Google to search for.

The results, which range from New Yorkers looking for bail money to Florida's fascination with alligator wrestling, give an insight into each state's minds.

Estately used Google's Trends to determine which words, terms, and questions each state was searching for more than any other

Google Trends is a free search tool based on Google Search.

Amongst a huge range of queries, it can show how often a particular search-term is entered relative to the total search-volume across various regions of the world, and in various languages.

This allows firms to look at which terms each state is searching for.

'America’s fifty states have a lot in common, but if their internet search histories are any indication they also have significant differences,' said property firm Estately.

It used Google's Trends to determine which words, terms, and questions each state was searching for more than any other.

'No doubt this information will come in handy for anyone trying to 
decide which state they want to buy a home in, especially for those 
curious how their potential neighbors spend their time online,' the site
 said.

Google Trends is a free search tool based on Google Search. Amongst a huge range of queries, it can show how often a particular search-term is entered relative to the total search-volume across various regions of the world, and in various languages.

It also offered a short analysis for each state.

For instance, in New Hampshire, Cats, Ellen Degeneres, Fireworks and Free Kittens were the top queries, leading to the pithy analysis 'You can pet New Hampshire’s cats when you pry them from their cold, dead hands!'
