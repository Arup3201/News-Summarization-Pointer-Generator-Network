Navy warship HMS Iron Duke and its 180-strong crew have docked in Portsmouth after a six-month patrol of the South Atlantic, making it home just in time for Christmas.

Hundreds of friends and loved ones lined the harbour as the brave servicemen and women returned, having visited 11 countries and travelled 27,000 miles.

During the six months away, the ship and its crew protected UK interests abroad, joining allies to develop armed forces training and defending waters from piracy as well as lending humanitarian assistance where necessary.

The ship left the UK in June and travelled down the west coast of Africa, across the South Atlantic to the Falkland Islands, up the west coast of South America and through the Panama Canal back to Portsmouth

Naval officers were seen holding young children they had not seen in months as twin brothers both among the ship's crew embraced their mother for the first time since they left Britain in June.

The crew spent six months aboard HMS Iron Duke, which Prince William served on in 2008, travelling down the west coast of Africa, across the South Atlantic to the Falkland Islands, up the west coast of South America and through the Panama Canal back to Portsmouth.

She paid goodwill port visits in the Canary Islands, Cape Verde, Guinea, Ghana, Nigeria, Namibia, South Africa, Panama, Haiti, Barbados and the Azores and also visited the Falkland Islands and South Georgia as part of the successful deployment.  

Iron Duke's Commanding Officer, Commander Thomas Tredray, said: 'This has been a very successful deployment for HMS Iron Duke. We have represented the Royal Navy and the UK around the world, on the high seas and during a wide variety of port visits.

'Throughout this, the ship's company have achieved everything that has been asked of them and I am very proud of how well they have performed.'

HMS Iron Duke was launched in 1991 by the Duke and Duchess of Wellington and is the third warship to bear its name 

The ship's crew have eaten their way through 7,760 sausages and 1.5 tonnes of baked beans since setting off, as well as producing seven million litres of fresh water, ITV reported.

Chef Lewis Stafford, 26, one of nine chefs on board, said: 'This has been the first deployment of my career, and I won't forget it anytime soon. It has been a great opportunity to really get stuck into my various job roles, hobbies and interests. 

'In Guinea I took part in the outreach project where we painted a school and helped create a better learning environment for those who studied there. This was a very memorable and reflective experience.'
