Amir Hekmati, a former U.S. marine, has been held in Iran since 2011. His father Ali has pleaded for son's release in a letter to Iranian President Hasan Rouhani, who is in New York this week

The ailing father of a former U.S. Marine imprisoned in Iran is pleading for the release of his son in a letter delivered on Wednesday to Iranian President Hasan Rouhani, in New York to attend a meeting of world leaders.

Ali Hekmati is asking Rouhani to order the release of his son, Amir, who was arrested in Iran in 2011. The family says Amir Hekmati, who has dual U.S. and Iranian citizenship, was visiting his grandmother.

Iran accused him of being a CIA spy and convicted him.

'I long more than ever to see Amir's 
face. I am now very sick with a brain tumor,' Ali Hekmati wrote in the 
letter, which was delivered to Rouhani's delegation by an Islamic 
religious official from Michigan who has a personal relationship with 
the Iranian president, according to a representative for the family.

'I ask that you let me see him again,
one more time, and so that he may lead our family when I am gone,' 
Hekmati wrote in his letter.

'Amir is a good man. An honorable man. He is not a spy, I can assure you of that.'

A spokesman at the Iranian Mission to the U.N. did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The family has cause for hope: Rouhani's
moderate tone could signal a warming of relations with the United 
States. Iran freed dozens of political prisoners in the last week, just 
as Rouhani was headed to New York for the annual meeting of the United 
Nations General Assembly.

Ali Hekmati, 61, recovering after the removal of a brain tumor, gets a kiss by his wife Behnaz, 56, at Providence Hospital in Michigan on Monday. Hekmati is pleading for the release of his son, former U.S. Marine Amir Hekmati, in a letter delivered on Wednesday to Iranian President Hasan Rouhani, who is in New York to attend a meeting of world leaders.

Earlier this month, Hekmati wrote a 
letter to Kerry describing his 'miserable prison conditions' and his 
belief that Tehran wanted to use him in a possible prisoner exchange.

Hekmati's
letter was smuggled out of prison. His sister authenticated the 
handwriting. The State Department said it was trying to determine 
Hekmati's condition through Swiss diplomats in Tehran.

The
Swiss represent U.S. interests in Iran because no U.S. officials are 
based there. The two countries severed diplomatic relations in 1979.

Two
other American citizens are believed to be detained in Iran: Retired 
FBI agent Robert Levinson and Christian pastor Saeed Abedini.
