Bosses at an NHS trust have  issued a bizarre list of guidelines to stop anyone at their Christmas party facing  discrimination.

The equality and diversity team at Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust assembled the list of discriminatory party pitfalls which include catering food for all religious, cultural and disability requirements.

Their leaked Equality Bulletin seems to indicate that office parties in the NHS are viewed as a  minefield of political correctness.

The extraordinary briefing told party organisers that 'there could be the potential for claims of sexual discrimination' if they did not ensure that the bash was scheduled for a time and location where women with 'caring responsibilities' would be able to attend.

It also warned staff that the staple of office parties - enjoying a few Christmas drinks - could also be deemed discriminatory because people under 18 would not be able to join in.

'If the venue is on licensed premises, there is the potential for age discrimination. Think about how this difficulty could be overcome. If there is no age restriction on the venue, remind under 18s they should not be drinking alcohol.'

The food on offer is also highlighted as a potential pitfall, with the authors stating: 'You need to cater for the needs of everyone attending the event to avoid discrimination. Consider the religious and cultural requirements and possible adjustments for disabled employees.'

Managers were also told they should carry out 'a full risk assessment of possible risks before the party/event. This will serve to both reduce the risk of any accidents, and also assist in defending any claims should they happen.'

It was drawn up by the equality and diversity team at Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust.

The head of the team is Barbara Harris - referred to in the briefing as 'Babs' - who earns a £50,854 a year salary overseeing the hospital's equality programme.

Last year the trust announced it would have to make £30m of cuts.

Jonathan Isaby, Chief Executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance, today blasted the document as a 'total waste of money.'

The guidelines from the Trust, which runs The Royal County Sussex Hospital, have been ridiculed as a 'total waste of time... and money'

He said: 'When we're trying to make savings, having an employee write up commonsense rules for having fun at a Christmas party seems like a total waste of time, effort, and taxpayers' money.

'The cost of the Nanny State continues to be placed on the back of hard-working ordinary people.'

The briefing's authors urge party organisers to choose a date which does not clash with other staff's religious festivals or requirements, stating: 'It is important to enjoy yourself, but the Trust's Dignity At Work Policy should be observed.'

It also warns employees against calling in sick the next day with a hangover, stating: 'Absence from work following Christmas parties/events - it is worth remembering, unless there is a valid reason for absences, i.e a genuine illness, unforeseen emergency (for example breakdown in care arrangements or household), it will be considered an unauthorised absence and may lead to disciplinary action being taken.'

Finally, it lists contact details for three companies providing interpreting services, as well as an out-of-hours contact for an organisation specialising in sign language and lip-reading for the deaf. 

The Trust issued the ten guidelines to ensure no-one was at risk of discrimination at their Christmas party.

1. Employees are reminded: ‘It is important to enjoy yourself, but the Trust’s Dignity At Work Policy should be observed.’ Organisers should remember that not all staff celebrate Christmas, so it is vital to make sure parties don’t clash with other, non-Christian religious festivals.

2. ‘There could be the potential for claims for sex discrimination.’ Women with ‘caring responsibilities’ should not be excluded. Nor should any staff currently on maternity or paternity leave.

3. Agency workers should also have access to the party.

4. ‘If the venue is on licensed premises, there is the potential for age discrimination. Think about how this difficulty could be overcome. If there is no age restriction on the venue, remind under 18’s they should not be drinking alcohol.’

5. ‘By choosing a venue that does not enable access, could potentially be cause for disability discrimination (remember disability covers more than just physical access, toilets, etc). Disabled employees must not be treated less favourably than non-disabled employees.’

6. Party planners must remember they have a ‘duty of care’ towards those who attend. Make sure there are designated drivers and keep the number of a local taxi firm handy in case someone is too drunk to drive home.

7.  ‘Absence from work following Christmas parties/events — it is worth remembering, unless there is a valid reason for absences, i.e. a genuine illness, unforeseen emergency (for example breakdown in care arrangements or household), it will be considered an unauthorised absence and may lead to disciplinary action being taken.’

8. ‘Managers . . . should carry out a full assessment of possible risks before the party/event. This will serve to both reduce the risk of any accidents, and also assist in defending any claims should they happen.’

9.‘You need to cater for the needs of everyone attending the event to avoid discrimination. Consider the religious and cultural requirements and possible adjustments for disabled employees.’

10. Emergency numbers are listed for three companies providing interpreting services, plus an out-of-hours contact for an organisation specialising in sign language and lip-reading for the deaf.
