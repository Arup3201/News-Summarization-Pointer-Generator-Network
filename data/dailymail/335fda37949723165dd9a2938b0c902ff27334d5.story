A hedge fund manager has plunked down the most money ever paid in the U.S. for a residential property to land a massive seaside estate in the Hamptons.

The East Hampton property was bought by Jana Partners hedge fund manager Barry Rosenstein for a staggering $147million smashed the previous record of $120million paid for a Greenwich, Connecticut home only two weeks ago.

A pond, formal gardens and a private beach are included on the 18-acre property sold without a broker, according to the New York Post.

Jerry Seinfeld and many other power brokers are among the financier’s newest neighbors, according to the paper.

It was sold privately to help the owner avoid paying commission to a broker, sources told the paper.

The massive estate was the dream home of Christopher H. Browne, the former managing director of the Tweedy, Browne Company investment firm – he died December 2009 at age 62 from a heart attack.

Browne left the home to architect Andrew Gordon, his partner of 10 years, sources said.

The will was contested by a dozen of the deceased investment guru’s relatives, but Gordon remained in the home after reaching a settlement three years after Browne’s death.

The old record holder: Copper Beech Farm, in Greenwich, Connecticut

Gordon was battling cancer at the time and died last September at age 52, the paper said.

The property then reverted back to Browne’s family, and they immediately put it on the market.

It was sold to an unidentified person in a direct transaction that avoided paying hefty broker commissions.

‘Somehow, someone got the inside track. All the brokers are crestfallen,’ said another person.

The previous record sale for a residential property was of the Copper Beech Farm, in Greenwich, for $120million.

Copper Beech Farm’s buyer has yet to be named.
