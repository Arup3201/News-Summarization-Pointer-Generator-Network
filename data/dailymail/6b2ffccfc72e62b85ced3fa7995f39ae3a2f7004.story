Lance Armstrong's ex-fiance Sheryl Crow has spoken out amid continuing allegations that she knew about the shamed cyclist's doping.

Appearing on Entertainment Tonight, the 50-year-old rock star told host Nancy O'Dell that she had caught 'bits and pieces' of Armstrong's confessional interview with Oprah Winfrey last week.

During the interview which will air on Tuesday night, Crow says that 'honesty is always the best bet and that the truth will set you free.'

Spotlight: Sheryl Crow's interview in which she speaks about her former fiance Lance Armstrong's doping confession will air on Tuesday night

The Grammy Award winning musician was
in a relationship with the disgraced cyclist from 2003 to 2006, which 
coincided with the last two of his tainted seven Tour de France wins.

Speaking of his decision to confess 
to using performance enhancing drugs last week, Crow said, 'To carry 
around a weight like that would be devastating in the long run.'

This comes as reports claim that Crow, who famously 
dated Armstrong a decade ago, knew all about his
cheating ways.

The Grammy 
Award winner, was reportedly present when Armstrong asked teammate Frankie Andreu and his wife to retract a statement that they'd heard Armstrong tell a doctor had doped in an Indiana hospital room in 1996.

Armstrong started dating Crow in 2003 and the couple were briefly engaged before calling it quits for good in 2006.

Celebuzz reported that she was twice named in affidavits given to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency by Betsy Andreu that alleged Armstrong had used performance enhancing substances.

Crow herself has not spoken about the doping allegations.

In an interview last year with Katie Couric, she said: I felt bad. I felt bad for [Armstrong], I felt bad for his family and I kinda felt like the rest of America.'

Crow's reps did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

She added: 'He is a hero that we watched and looked up to and admired.'

Armstrong refrained from mentioning Crow in his landmark admission interview with Oprah Winfrey that aired last week on her OWN network.

After the interview aired, Betsy Andreu spoke to CNN and was on the verge of tears as she spoke of her disbelief and disappointment that the disgraced athlete didn't come clean.

Armstrong told Oprah that he believes he deserves to be given the opportunity to compete again

She said: 'He owed it to me. You owed it
to me, Lance, and you dropped the ball. After what you’ve done to me 
and what you’ve done to my family, and you couldn’t own up to it? Now 
we’re supposed to believe you?

'You had one chance at the truth, and
this was it. If the hospital room didn't happen then just say it didn't
happen. But he won't do it because it DID happen.

'That's
not being transparent. That's not being completely honest. By saying he
won't go there is just skirting around the issue.

'This exchange has made me furious. 
He used to be my friend and he decimated me. I was willing to give him a
chance and this is how he responds? It just doesn't make sense.'

Armstrong was close to tears at times when he spoke about the impact of his drug cheating on his family during the second part of his exclusive interview with Oprah Winfrey on Friday night.

Winfrey also drew Armstrong out on 
his ex-wife, Kristin, whom he claimed knew just enough about both the 
doping and lying to ask him to stop.

He credited her with making him 
promise that his comeback in 2009 would be drug-free.

'She said to me, "You can do it under one condition: That you never cross that line again,'" Armstrong recalled.

'The line of drugs?' Winfrey asked.

'Yes. And I said, "You've got a deal,'" he replied. 'And I never would have betrayed that with her.'

Armstrong has also been romantically linked to fashion designer Tory Burch, whom he dated in 2007, but her knowledge of the cyclist's doping is not known.

Speaking about his 13-year-old son 
Luke, the oldest of his five children, Armstrong told Oprah: 'I saw my son 
defending me and saying, "That's not true. What you're saying about my 
dad is not true.'"

'That's when I knew I had to tell him.'

Critics said Armstrong hadn't been contrite enough in the first half of the interview, but on Friday night he seemed to lose his composure when Winfrey zeroed in on the emotional drama involving his personal life.

‘What did you say?’ Winfrey asked.

‘I said, "Listen, there's been a lot 
of questions about your dad. My career. Whether I doped or did not dope.
I've always denied that and I've always been ruthless and defiant about
that. You guys have seen that. That's probably why you trusted me on 
it." Which makes it even sicker,’ Armstrong said.

'And uh, I told Luke, I said,' and here Armstrong paused for a long time to collect himself, 'I said, "Don't defend me anymore. Don't.'"

'If anyone says anything to you, do not defend me. Just say my dad said he was sorry'.

'He said "look, I love you, you're my dad, this won't change that."

Armstrong said his lowest moment was having to cut ties with his charity which he described as like a 'sixth child' to him

'Thank God he's more like Kristin (Armstrong's first wife and Luke's mother).'

Armstrong also confirmed he has been undergoing therapy to deal with his demons.

Armstrong was competing in triathlons, mountain bike events and marathons before he was sanctioned and believes he deserves that opportunity in the future, suggesting a life ban is not right.

He told Oprah Winfrey in the second part of their television interview: 'I can't lie to you. I'd love the opportunity to be able to compete, but that isn't the reason that I'm doing this.

'Frankly, this might not be the most popular answer, but I think I deserve it (to be able to compete again).'
