World triple jump champion Teddy Tamgho has been banned for a year for missing three drug tests in an 18-month period, the French Athletics Federation has announced.

The Frenchman, the third longest jumper in history, will be suspended until March 17 next year.Tamgho, who became only the third man to go over 18 metres when he leapt 18.04m to win the world title in Moscow last August, had not been expected to compete this summer anyway after suffering a fractured tibia in November.

The 25-year-old will also now miss the 2015 indoor season, but will be back in plenty of time for the defence of his world crown in Beijing that August.

Banned: France's Teddy Tamgho is not able to compete for one year

The federation's disciplinary board's decision said Tamgho had missed tests on 19 December 2012 and 28 January and 18 March 2014. His suspension was backdated to March 18.

But the board accepted Tamgho had not sought to deliberately skip the drug tests.

'The board does not doubt the good faith of the athlete. The attitude of Teddy Tamgho is more neglect and lack of diligence than a genuine desire to evade doping controls,' it said in its decision.Tamgho has 45 days to appeal the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

The controversial athlete burst on to the global scene by winning the world indoor title in Doha in 2010 with a then indoor world record of 17.90m.

His career has been troubled by disciplinary and injury problems.
