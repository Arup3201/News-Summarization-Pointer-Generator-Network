Ringo Starr needs a little Help! finding five teenage fans that he photographed during The Beatles’ first tour of America in 1964.

The group were snapped by Starr in Miami Beach, Florida, after their car drew up alongside the convertible The Beatles were in.

A sixth youngster can be seen in the background on the right-hand side.

They would now be in their sixties and the musician is hoping that they will come forward, or that someone will recognise them.

The picture is being published for the first time in Starr’s new book Photograph, along with over 200 never-before-seen shots.

Starr, 73, wrote in the book: ‘It’s just a great shot. They're looking at us and I'm photographing them.’

He added: ‘I love pictures put together, showing different times of your life.’

The Beatles formed in Liverpool in the late 1950s with their most famous line-up being John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr.

The group’s first big hit in the States was I Want To Hold Your Hand, which sold 1.5 million copies in less than three weeks.

A crowd of thousands greeted them at the airport in New York when they arrived for their tour and one radio station even aired a running commentary on the event.

Their first gig in America took place in Washington DC and their first US TV appearance – on the Ed Sullivan Show - attracted around 70 million viewers.

Meanwhile, Ringo Starr's lyrics for Abbey Road song Octopus's Garden have recently been turned into a children's book.

The book comes with a CD featuring a reading by Ringo Starr and a never-before-heard version of the song.

There are just 2,500 copies of Photograph for sale. Each one is signed by the author and is available from www.RingoPhotoBook.com.
