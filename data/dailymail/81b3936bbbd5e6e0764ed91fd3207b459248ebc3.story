Paolo Di Canio applied for the vacant Bolton manager's job as he looks to return to football.

The Italian apparently threw his hat into the ring as Wanderers look to replace Dougie Freedman, who left 'by mutual consent' last week.

However, Di Canio is unlikely to get the job, say the Telegraph. He has been out of work since being fired by Sunderland in September last year but has good lower-league credentials from his time at Swindon.

Paolo Di Canio applied for the Bolton job but is unlikely to be appointed by Wanderers 

It is thought Bolton are looking for someone with a connection to the club and their former midfielder Peter Reid is keen on a role.

The 58-year-old is currently preparing Mumbai City for the start of the Indian Super League season but would be willing to talk about a return to Wanderers, for whom he played more than 200 times between 1974 and 1982.

It is thought he would favour a role using his experience to oversee a young, up-and-coming coach, such as current Bolton academy director Jimmy Phillips.

Tony Mowbray and Chris Hughton are the bookies' favourites, while ex-Bolton captain and assistant manager Phil Brown - who is boss of Southend - is also linked.

Steve Clarke, another out-of-work boss, has also been mentioned in The Sun and it is thought Wanderers could be keen on the Scot.

Bolton are currently bottom of the Championship and face Birmingham away in their next match on October 18, by which time they would hope to have appointed a new manager.
