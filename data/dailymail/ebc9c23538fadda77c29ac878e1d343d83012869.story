Killing machine: A guillotine used by the Nazis to execute opponents of the Third Reich has been found in the basement of a museum

The guillotine used to behead one of Adolf Hitler’s youngest and bravest opponents has been found in the basement of a museum.

The discovery has triggered a debate about whether it should now go on show in tribute to Sophie Scholl, 21, her brother Hans and other members of the White Rose resistance group.

After Hitler rose to power he decreed that so-called traitors and other opponents of his regime should be executed and ordered the construction of 20 guillotines, more usually associated with revolutionary era France.

The device used to kill the Scholls was found in the basement of  the Bavarian National Museum  in Munich.

Back in 1943 Sophie and Hans, 24, were distributing anti-war leaflets at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich when they were caught by the custodian, Jakob Schmid, who informed the Gestapo.

The leaflets told the truth about Nazi atrocities in Russia and the stunning defeat at Stalingrad for the German Sixth Army the previous month.

On February 22, a Nazi judge sentenced Sophie and Hans to death for treason and they were beheaded the same day in Stadelheim prison. Three other White Rose members were also executed.

Gestapo interrogators had offered Sophie the chance of survival if she blamed the leaflets entirely on her brother and other White Rose members, but she refused. Since then numerous books have been written about them and thousands of streets and squares in modern-day Germany are named after them.

But now comes the difficult issue of what to do with the guillotine that ended their lives now it has resurfaced.

Victims: (left to right) Hans Scholl,  Sophie Scholl and Christoph Probst, all members of the German anti-nazi resistance movement The White Rose. They were all executed in 1943

Brave: Sophie was only 21 when she and her brother faced the guillotine in 1943

A museum spokesman said the machine had been locked away decades ago because it was deemed too macabre to put on display.

Hildegard
 Kronawitter, chairman of the White Rose Foundation which perpetuates 
the memory of the Scholls, said the guillotine should form the 
centrepiece of a new exhibition honouring their resistance.

‘You
 cannot lock away such an artefact and pretend that it doesn’t exist,’ 
she said. ‘It must be presented to the public in its historical 
context.’

But Franz Josef 
Mueller, who at 89 is the last surviving member of the White Rose group,
 said: ‘No, this should not go on display.

‘No
 entertainment must be made of their violent deaths.

'The memory of 
Sophie and Hans is deep within me. I think of them every day.’

Bavaria’s
 arts minister Ludwig Spaenle said: ‘One must proceed with great 
sensitivity and reverence. One cannot decide what to do with this 
overnight.’

Honour: Sophie Scholl (by the fence) and other members of the White Rose. Scholars are now debating whether the machine should be displayed in the two's honour
