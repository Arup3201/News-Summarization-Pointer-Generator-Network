Roberto Martinez has accused Chelsea's players of trying to influence referees and believes their pressure cost Everton at Stamford Bridge.

Writing in his programme notes ahead of today's game against Leicester, Everton manager Martinez expressed his bitter disappointment how an ill-tempered game was settled 11 days ago, when Gareth Barry was sent-off and Everton conceded a last minute goal.

Martinez feels referee Jon Moss was subject to constant pressure and he has taken Jose Mourinho - who has appeared on Goals On Sunday to express his displeasure about the perceived 'campaign' that Chelsea have endured this season - to task for how his squad behaved.

Unfortunately, the sending off really late on reflected the emphasis that the home team had in trying to influence the referee and take advantage of their role of playing at Stamford Bridge,' wrote Martinez.

'Mo Besic being booked after five minutes was a very loose way to referee a game and there was no need to show as many yellow cards as there were.

'But, more importantly, I never felt there was any consistency in judging every action equally between the two teams.

'That made it a tougher way to digest a defeat that we didn't deserve and showed a very similar ending to last season's game at Stamford Bridge.

'Big games need strong referees but, for the future, we relish the challenge of finding the way of overcoming these disadvantages by playing our football.'
