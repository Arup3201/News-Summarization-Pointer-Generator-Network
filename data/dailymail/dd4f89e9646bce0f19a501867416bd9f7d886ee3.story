One in eight mortgages are now buy-to-let loans

One in eight mortgages are now buy-to-let loans – the most since records began.

‘Landord loans’ now account for 1.44million of the 11.3million mortgages in this country, or  12.7 per cent.

A decade ago, there were only 275,500 buy-to-let loans, equal to just 2.4 per cent of the market.

Today’s figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders show that not only are there more buy-to-let loans than ever before, they also account for the largest ever proportion of the overall market.

The change is partly because a generation of young people have been locked out of the housing market by soaring house prices and tougher lending restrictions by banks.

The figures come a day after Housing Minister Mark Prisk slammed Britain’s housing market as ‘dysfunctional’.

The Tory MP said it ‘cannot be right’ that large numbers of people in their 20s and 30s cannot afford to buy their own home and have to stay living with their parents.

Last month, a report from the Financial Services Authority, the City regulator, said the buy-to-let boom has added to the problems facing first-time buyers.

It said the average age at which a young person manages to buy their first home is 31 and they earn an average salary of around £34,000.

By comparison, a typical buy-to-let investor is between the age of 45 and 64 and is a higher-rate taxpayer, which means they earn more than £42,475.

Banks tend to charge a higher interest rate on buy-to-let loans, based on the rental income from the property, than they do on standard mortgages, where they base it on a buyer’s salary.

Traditionally, buy-to-let properties have also been considered higher risk because if owners get into financial difficulty they are far more likely to stop making repayments on a rental property than their own home.

With the base rate at an all-time low, many homeowners decide to put their nest egg into a second buy-to-let property as an alternative to keeping it in savings accounts offering tiny rates of interest.

Dan McLeod, a director of the estate agency Atkinson McLeod, said: ‘The demand from investors for buy-to-let has never been stronger.’

Yesterday the Bank of England’s interest-rate setting committee voted to keep the base rate at 0.5 per cent for the 44th consecutive month, the longest period without a change since the aftermath of the Second World War.

Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, the consultancy, said: ‘The danger is that the Bank of England is looking increasingly helpless, working with ineffectual policy tools in an economy that looks set to worsen, which will do nothing to boost business and consumer confidence.’
