Brenda Gorst, pictured, endured a seven-year 'nightmare' after a botched hip operation and has won £250,000 in damages

A grandmother who was left with her foot pointing 90 degrees in the wrong direction after a surgeon botched her hip operation has won £250,000 in damages.

Brenda Gorst developed a life-threatening infection and her leg was left shorter following blunders by a consultant at Abergele Hospital in North Wales.

Since her surgery in October 2007, the 73-year-old has endured six major operations to try to correct the problem and faces further procedures to rebuild her femur, hip and pelvis.

Mrs Gorst began suffering aches and pains in her hips in her 60s, and was recommended for hip replacement surgery.

She said: 'When I woke up from the operation, my leg was black and I was in agony. It took some time to realise something had gone badly wrong.'

The pain and swelling in her leg did not subside, and a revision operation was proposed.

She said: 'After the second operation, it became obvious that my right foot had started to point east. They tried to put my foot straight using sandbags.'

During one of the operations, Mrs Gorst, who now lives in Newton-le-Willows in Merseyside but used to live in Rhos-on-Sea in Wales, contracted an infection.

She claims that when she was sent for a second opinion and an X-ray, the new consultant was visibly shocked at what he saw.

Mrs Gorst said: 'I was in acute pain, the bruising and swelling was terrible and my leg was twisted in entirely the wrong direction.

'At that point they thought I had a flesh-eating disease. They told me I could be dead in three days. It wasn’t a flesh-eating disease, but it was still a vicious infection.

'My leg is virtually useless. I’ve gone from someone who was active to someone who is unable to do many of the things I used to take for granted.'

The hip replacement has since been removed but her leg bone is now fused to the pelvis, shortening Mrs Gorst’s leg by four inches.

She won damages following a legal battle with the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board.

Her lawyer Daniel Lee, of Slater & Gordon, said: 'Her mobility and activity are dramatically reduced as a result of the operation which was meant to give her a new lease of life.'

Professor Matthew Makin, executive medical director at Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, apologised for the distress caused to Mrs Gorst.

He said: 'On behalf of the health board, I am sorry that the care Mrs Gorst received at the time fell short of the standards she deserved.

'We aim to provide excellent care and have looked carefully at this case to make sure mistakes are learned from and cannot be repeated.'
