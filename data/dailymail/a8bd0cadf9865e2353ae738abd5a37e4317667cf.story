A conker, lesbian porn DVDs and homeopathic medicine were among items found in bags stashed behind bins in the car park of Rebekah and Charles Brooks' home, the hacking trial heard today.

The Old Bailey was shown pictures of a brown leather satchel and a black bag handed into police by a building manager after being found by a cleaner in July 2011, the day after Mrs Brooks' arrest.

Mr Brooks, who had come in search of the property, told staff the two bags had been dropped off for him in London the night before and there had been some sort of mix up, the court was told.

Photographs of the bags and lists of 
their contents were shown to the trial jury today. Titles of the DVDs listed 
included Instant Lesbian, Bride of Sin, and Lesbian Psychodrama volume 2
 and 3.

The brown bag 
contained a phone, a dictaphone, small USB stick, laptop computer, 
correspondence, homeopathic medicine, pills, a conker, a brown envelope 
containing DVD cases and other items.

It
 also allegedly had cheque books in the name of racehorse trainer Mr Brooks, 50, and
 Mrs Brooks, 44, the former News International (NI) chief executive,
 both of Churchill, Oxfordshire,

The
 contents of the black bag included more letters, an Apple laptop with a
 NI tag, an iPad, 50p piece, and a blue bag containing a bronze-coloured
 charm on a chain.

Meanwhile,
 the court was told former head of security Mark Hanna, 50, told a 
colleague on the day the News of the World was closed down that he had dug a hole and ‘burned stuff’.

Rupert
 Murdoch shut the newspaper in July 2011 at the height of public
 outrage that journalists on it had hacked voicemail messages of 
mobile phones, including that of a murdered schoolgirl.

Seven
 people including Rebekah Brooks are on trial for a variety of offences 
stemming from police investigations into phone-hacking.

Former head of security: Mark Hanna, 50, denies conspiring to pervert the course of justice

The
 Old Bailey heard that after the final edition of the News of the World 
had gone to press and the staff had left on July 9, Hanna, then head of 
security at News International went for drink with one of his security 
team, Robert Hernandez.

Mr Hernandez
 told the court they spent about two hours in a pub near the offices, 
during which time Hanna talked about how he had provided protection for 
Brooks, whom he described as kind and a good boss, before going on to 
discuss the closure of the News of the World for another 10 to 15 
minutes.

‘He mentioned one 
time he dug a hole in his garden and burnt stuff,’ Mr Hernandez said. ‘I 
asked him if it was papers. He didn't reply.’

Hanna
 is accused with Brooks of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice 
by concealing material from police, charges they deny.

Under questioning from Hanna's lawyer William Clegg, Mr Hernandez agreed they had talked about lots of different subjects.

‘It was a fire in his garden, we know not when and we know not what,’ Mr Clegg put to him.

‘That's correct,’ Mr Hernandez replied. ‘For all I know he could have been burning bank statements.’

Another
 witness Glen Jagger, the security operations manager for News 
International, said bosses had received ‘quite a bit’ of hate mail at 
the time, and there had been actual threats made to executives including
 Brooks.

Claim; Charlie Brooks, who had come in search of the property, told staff the two bags had been dropped off for him the night before and there had been some sort of mix up, the court was told

Some of this hate 
mail was discovered at Hanna's home where he had taken it to assess what
 risk, if any, the authors posed, the court was told.

Mr Clegg
 read out some excerpts from the mail which included phrases such as 
‘rotting in hell would be too good a punishment’, while another said 
‘the universal law of karma will exact its revenge’.

Last
 week, the trial heard how the Brooks couple arranged a plan to hide two bags containing computers and 
other material from detectives before they searched the couple's London 
apartment.

There were also 
pills prescribed to Mrs Brooks, and a British Kunekune Pig Society 
newsletter. An inventory of the bags shown to the jury also revealed 
there was a magazine titled Lesbian Lovers.

Mr and Mrs Brooks, along with Hanna, 50, of Buckingham,
 Buckinghamshire, deny conspiring to pervert the course of justice 
between July 15 and July 19 2011.

The seven defendants in the case deny the charges against them. The trial continues.
