A father-of-two sent his two young daughters to stay with their grandparents 'before strangling their mother and hanging himself' two days before she was due to move out, an inquest heard.

Mark Langtree, 38, researched 'murder-suicide' online hours before killing Nicola and then himself after struggling to cope with the breakdown of their 11-year marriage.

The deaths were discovered when Mr Langtree's father became concerned that his son had not called his two daughters and visited the businessman's luxury home in Wigan.

Mr Langtree believed his wife was having an affair and began 'stalking' her by hanging around outside her place of work and checking her phone and emails for messages, the inquest heard.

But when she began divorce proceedings against him, and made plans to move out of their luxury marital home with their two children, he killed her before taking his own life.

The inquest heard Mr Langtree's body was found suspended from the stairs in November last year at the couple's detached four- bedroom home in Whitley, Lancashire, where they had lived for around 10 years.

Mrs Langtree, 34, was found during a police search of their home on the floor of an upstairs bedroom.

She had been strangled with an electrical cable and a post-mortem on her body revealed bruising to her jaw, chest and upper arms, indicating she was involved in a struggle.

Mrs Langtree's father James Byrne told the inquest that the couple's marriage started to break down around six months before their deaths.

'Both Mark and Nicola were living separate lives,' said Mr Byrne.

'They were living under the same roof but were sleeping in separate bedrooms for the sake of the children.

'Their relationship started to deteriorate and Mark started to do petty things that annoyed Nicola.

'While she was working he started stalking her and started waiting outside for her and taking photos.

'He had read something on her phone saying 'shall we have a coffee?' and from there it was just one thing after another.

'He started checking her phone and emails and just didn't trust her for some obscure reason

'She was very close to me and her mother and she would have told us if anything was untoward.' 

Mr Byrne told the inquest that Mr Langtree became uninterested in his children

He said: 'I know he had a high pressure job but he would come home from work and not even say hello.

'He would just drop his case and wouldn't even give Nicola a kiss on the cheek.

'He was playing mind games for the last three months.'

He also told Bolton Coroner's Court that his daughter believed she had been drugged just weeks before her death after drinking a glass of wine which tasted 'metallic'.

In the month before his death, Mr Langtree appeared to try and take his own life and was found by his wife in a room above their garage with an Ikea bag, cans of beer and some pills.

Mr Byrne said that Nicola had found him with a rope around his neck having taken drink and tablets The following month the couple went on holiday to Spain.

He added that the father-of-two had told his daughters, 'mummy and daddy are splitting up and daddy doesn't want them to'.

Mr Langtree's father told the inquest he believed this was a 'cry for help'. 

Both Mr and Mrs Langtree were listed as directors of Langtree Property Services in Huddersfield.

Home Office pathologist Philip Lumb said that Nicola had suffered a striking horizontal ligature to his neck and injuries and bruising to her face and chest including a bruised eye and jaw.

Dr Lumb said that the ligature marks were consistent with an electrical cable and the hair dryer had been the closest match.

He added that the bruise to the jaw could have been from a blow such as a punch or could have been from contact with the ground. 

Assistant Coroner for Manchester West Rachel Griffin recorded a verdict of pressure to the neck for Mrs Langtree and hanging for Mr Langtree.

She said: 'Sadly I am unable to say what happened after 7pm on 12 November 2014, but I accept the evidence that has been given to me today.

'I offer my sympathies and condolences to both families for the loss of a daughter and the loss of a son.

'What occurred on and between the 12th November and the 13th November can only be described as a tragedy of extreme proportion.

'My greatest sympathies however remain with two children  who must now live with not having lost just one parent but with two parents.

'Quite clearly to Nicola and Mark, those children were the centre of their lives.'  

Detective Inspector Andrew Naysmith from Greater Manchester Police told the inquest he attended the scene.

He said: 'The address was secure when we attended. 'Mark was hanging from the bannister and Nicola was on the floor of the upstairs bedroom. Both were clearly deceased.

'In our minds we had discovered a murder suicide which had no third-party involvement.

'There was some items found on the laptop belonging to Mark.

'Between 4pm and 4.15pm on 12th November 2014, searches had been undertaken regarding murder and suicide.'
