A Delta flight from New York to Florida was rerouted Monday due to passenger disruption - the third incident of its kind in less than a week.

Flight 2370 left New York at about 7pm, en route to West Palm Beach, but was forced to land in Jacksonville after a row broke out over reclining seats.

A spokesman for the airline said: 'Out of an abundance of caution, the captain elected to divert to the closest airport. Local law enforcement met the flight and removed the passenger.'

According to the airline, the diversion was 'due to safety reasons in regard to a passenger issue' but Florida television station WPTV reported that the plane rerouted due to a dispute over a reclining seat.

Passenger Aaron Klipin told the station a woman sitting next to him got into an argument with a passenger behind her.

The woman reclined her seat so she could knit while the other passenger was trying to sleep on the tray table.

Klipin said the woman who was trying to take a nap started screaming and swearing, drawing the attention of the flight crew.  

According to the passenger, when a flight attendant came over, the dispute between the two women became even more heated, and the woman with her head on the tray table demanded that the plane be diverted.

Klipin recalled hearing the woman say: 'I don't care about the consequences; put this plane down.'

Another traveler who spoke to ABC's Good Morning America described the woman as 'nuts,' saying that she launched into a tirade about her dead pets.

'She said, "I lost two dogs in the last month. I want her [the reclining passenger] off of here, or I'm going to leave; or I want you to stop the plane.'  

The stewardess went to talk to the pilot, who made the decision to land the plane 'out of an abundance of caution,' according to a Delta spokesman. 

A few minutes later, the flight touched down in Jacksonville, where it was met by local law enforcement officials who removed the unruly woman from the plane.

The flight later continued on to West Palm Beach, arriving after 11pm.

This is the third similar incident, after diminishing leg room contributed to two clashes just last week.

On Wednesday August 27, a American Airlines Miami-to-Paris flight was rerouted to Boston after air marshals had to restrain a man as two passengers came to blows when one of them attempted to recline their seat. 

The male passenger, Edmund Alexandre, of France, continued to be disruptive when a  crew member tried to calm him, following him down the aisle and grabbing his arm.

Two undercover federal air marshals on the flight then subdued  and handcuffed the 61-year-old traveler.

And on August 24, a fight started on a United Airlines flight when a male passenger resorted to using a Knee Defender, a $21 gadget designed to prevent the person in front  from reclining.

A female passenger, sitting in the middle of Row 11 tried to recline, but found she couldn’t. When it emerged that the man in the seat behind had attached a Knee Defender, she asked a member of cabin crew  to remove it.

He refused, saying that he would no longer be able to work on his laptop, and the situation escalated, with the woman hurling a glass of water in the man’s face.

The New Jersey-to-Denver flight was diverted to Chicago, and both of the passengers were booted off.

Reclining has long been a contentious issue, with surveys finding that as many as nine out of ten passengers believing that reclining seats should be banned on shorter flights.

There is even a campaign on business networking site LinkedIn to make airlines remove reclinable seats on short-haul journeys.
