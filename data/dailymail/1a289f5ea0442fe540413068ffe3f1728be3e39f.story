Arrested: Olivia Mora is being held without bail on charges of vehicular homicide under the influence

A Massachusetts driver is being held without bail after being charged with running over and killing a seven-year-old girl on Tuesday while allegedly driving under the influence.

Olivia Mora has been charged with motor vehicle homicide while operating under the influence, after hitting Brianna Rosales and her mother Glendalee Alvardao in Dorchester.

The seven-year-old had been walking home from school when Mora's Chevy Tahoe allegedly mounted the curb and ran into the girl and her mother at about 2.15pm.

Boston Police Superintendent in Chief 
Daniel Linskey said Mora's SUV was speeding just before the crash, and that it hit a car, the victims and a hydrant before coming to a stop in a front yard.

Brianna and her mother were rushed to hospital but the seven-year-old died. Her mother has had surgery for her injuries, WCVB reported.

'The mother's leg was so mangled -Â  I 
was trying to help the mom. She was unconscious at first,' a witness said. 'And the little girl was laying there - flat in the dirt, 
bleeding.'

Another witness said Mora allegedly tried to leave the scene of the accident, but was stopped by passers by who pulled her from the vehicle.

Nicole Macfarland, who saw the crash, said: 'You could see [Brianna] try to lift her head. She was fighting to get her breath. She fought a little more, but after a while she just stopped.'

Mora later failed three sobriety tests and refused a Breathalyzer test, authorities told the Boston Globe.

She allegedly told police she had her last drink at 10pm the night before the crash.

The 36-year-old driver has several motoring offenses, including speeding and lane violations, improper passing and seatbelt violations, according to WCVB.

Mora also had several suspensions for using a vehicle in Massachusetts because of a payment default, according to RMV records seen by the news station.

When she appeared in court on Wednesday morning, Mora's lawyer claimed she had eye problems that affected her depth perception.

She also told police her SUV had 'terrible tires' which had caused her to lose control of the car, Assistant District Attorney Masai King said.

Tributes: Toys and flowers were left at the scene of the crash

Mora pleaded not guilty to charges of vehicular homicide and has been denied bail.

At the scene of the crash, cuddly toys and notes have been piled up in the rain as parents try to explain to Brianna's young classmates what happened.

A statement from Jeichael Henderson, the principal of Holland School where Brianna was a pupil, said: 'It is with great sadness that I must let you know that late this afternoon just a few blocks from school, one of our young students was struck by a car and she later passed away.'
