The boy at the center of the cyber bullying feud that drove a young girl to suicide after she was terrorized online for a year admitted last night his feelings for her may have been the cause of the torment.

John Borgen was dating Florida teen Rebecca Sedwick, 12, who jumped to her death on September 10, before he started seeing Guadalupe Shaw.

The 14-year-old was arrested on Monday in connection with her death along with Katelyn Roman, 12, and Borgen admitted last night his continued affection for Rebecca may have been the cause of much of her death.

The 12-year-old was 'terrorized' by as many as
 15 girls who ganged up on her and picked on her for months through 
online message boards and texts.

Jealousy: John Borgen - pictured with Guadalupe Shaw, who has been arrested in connection with the death of Rebecca Sedwick - said he didn't know Rebecca was being bullied

Accused: Katelyn Roman, 12, left, and Guadalupe Shaw, 14, right, were arrested and charged with aggravated stalking in connection with the death of Rebecca Sedwick

Victim: Rebecca Sedwick jumped to her death on September 10. She would have been 13 this weekend

He had dated Sedwick when they were classmates at Crystal Lake Middle School in Lakeland, Florida, and had known her since she was eight-years-old.

After they split up he began dating Shaw - but said she was consumed with jealously because he made no secret of his affection for Rebecca.

'Guadalupe did not like the fact that I still liked Rebecca,' said Borgen, whose cover photo on his Facebook page shows him holding Guadalupe.

'She was angry that I still liked Rebecca and that I'd talk about her.

'It shocked me, it made me mad because she should have just told somebody,' he told WTSP.

He said of the tormentors: 'They need to take life seriously. Why do you need to be bullying somebody?'

Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said 
Tuesday that Shaw allegedly posted this heartless message on Facebook: 
'Yes IK [I know] I bullied REBECCA nd [sic] she killed her self but 
IDGAF [I don't give a f***].'

Sheriff
 Judd said that even though Shaw's parents say that she is nice and must
 have been hacked since she would never do such a thing, he cannot 
believe that they would allow her back online amid the controversy.

'This girl is back on Facebook after Rebecca dying? Can you believe parents would let their child do that?' he said.

'We will not tolerate that. If I can find something to charge her parents with - who are in total denial about this - I will. The apple does not fall far from the tree.

'Rebecca took the bullying to heart and we are not putting up with it. When I stood there at the base of that tower and saw that baby - that child - deceased on the ground it broke my heart and I know it would break the hearts of people all over the country if they were in my position.

'We want to send a message out to kids that anyone who cyber stalks or cyber bullies will be punished.'

In the middle: John Borgen previously dated Rebecca and her alleged tormentor Guadalupe Shaw

Devastated: Rebecca Ann Sedwick, 12, pictured with her mother Tricia Norman, is said to have had a disturbing upbringing

Denial: Guadalupe Shaw's parents - who did not want to be pictured - said their daughter was loving and caring and would never write those terrible things

While Shaw's parents are still in denial about their daughter's supposed actions, the parents of the other accused girl- Katelyn Roman- concede that they could have done more.

Katelyn's father told ABC: 'I feel horrible for the whole situation. It's my fault that maybe I don't know about that kind of stuff but I wish I did.'

One parent who was left reeling even after the arrests was that of Rebecca's mom Tricia as her daughter's 13th birthday would have been this weekend if she had not died last month.

After the arrests of her daughter's tormenters were announced, Tricia said: 'I felt like a big weight had been lifted. It was a mixture of tears, relief and sadness.

Tragic loss: Rebecca with her sister Amy

Bullied: Rebecca was withdrawn from her 
elementary school after being bullied and was home schooled by her mother Tricia (right) who says her daughter's death should be a warning to all parents to be vigilant

Tributes: Flowers, candles and messages are left out in memory of 12-year-old Rebecca

'Nobody took Rebecca's complaints of 
bullying seriously. They just said, "you need to toughen up - adapt to 
new surroundings- develop a thicker skin."'

Judd said they decided to arrest Shaw after she posted the 'reprehensible' message on Saturday.

'We decided that we can't leave her out there. Who else is she going to torment, who else is she going to harass?' he said.

Roman
 was Rebecca's former best friend, but Judd said the 14-year-old turned 
her against Rebecca. Other girls also stopped being friends with her in 
fear of being bullied, the sheriff said.

Missed: Rebecca Sedwick took her own life after being relentlessly bullied

'Several
 students corroborated stories of both girls bullying Sedwick on 
different occasions, through name-calling, intimidation, threats to beat
 her up, and at least one actual physical fight,' the sheriff said 
today.

He warned parents in a
 news conference yesterday: 'Watch what your children do online. Pay 
attention to what your kids are doing. Quit being their best friend and 
be their best parent.'

Roman
 and Shaw were arrested on Monday night and detained at the county's 
juvenile center before being released to their parents, the Orlando 
Sentinel reports.

They were charged with felony aggravated stalking.
