Netflix has signed a deal with three small cable-providers in the US to become a regular TV channel.

The agreements with Atlantic Broadband, RCN Telecom Services and Grande Communications gives the internet streaming site's subscription service a channel on TiVo boxes that the companies provide their customers.

It will debut on Atlantic and RCN on Monday and then will expand on to Grande's service by end of next month.

Collectively, the three services have around 820,000 subscribers scattered through nine states and Washington D.C.

Although it is a small fraction of the market, the deals represent another milestone for Netflix as it tries to make its Internet video service more like premium channels such as HBO and Showtime.

The online streaming service has already been included on digital and satellite boxes in the UK, Denmark and Sweden, but has not been able to make similar inroads in the US until now.

The company's nearly 36 million U.S. subscribers typically have to buy a separate device, such as games console or a specific device, if they want to stream video on to their TVs.

That method usually requires a separate remote and an additional step to change to a different TV input.

Now, Netflix will be like any other 
channel on the cable-TV dial, but will rely on a high-speed 
Internet connection to deliver its video.

'We
 think this signals a new generation of cable-TV service of offerings,' 
said David Isenberg, Atlantic's chief marketing and strategy officer. 
'It's a watershed moment.'

He
 likened what Netflix is doing for Internet video to what HBO did for 
cable-TV when that service began transmitting through satellites in the 
early 1970s.

Netflix has been striving to become more HBO-like since it expanded upon its DVD-by-mail service and began offering Internet streaming seven years ago.

In the past two years, the Los Gatos, California, company has been featuring more original programming, such as the critically acclaimed House of Cards and Orange Is The New Black to persuade more U.S. subscribers to pay $8 per month for its service.

To help pay for its rising programming costs, Netflix plans to raise its prices by $1 or $2 by July. The higher tariff will initially only impact new customers.

HBO, which is owned by Time Warner, views Netflix as such a threat that it has steadfastly refused to licenses its old TV shows, such as The Sopranos and The Wire, to the internet video service.

Those HBO shows instead will be streamed through a rival Internet video service offered through Amazon.com Inc.'s Prime shipping service as part of deal announced earlier this week.

'HBO fears Netflix's growing industry power,' BTIG Research analyst Richard Greenfield wrote in a Thursday blog post.

Competition: With original programmes such as Orange Is The New Black, Netlix is trying to rival premium streaming services such as those used by HBO

'We suspect HBO wanted to balance Netflix's growing media industry hegemony by helping to bolster their largest direct-to-consumer competitor â€” Amazon.'

Unlike their partnerships with HBO and Showtime, the cable-TV providers aren't offering a Netflix subscription as part of their bundled packages.

People will still have to open a Netflix account through the company's website or mobile application, although Atlantic is trying to make that process easier by offering a way to sign up on the TV screen.

Netflix is still hoping to be added to the programming lineup of a major cable-TV service. It seems unlikely that Netflix will make its way onto a cable box offered by the biggest service, Comcast Corp any time soon.

The relationship between the two companies has grown frosty because Netflix is opposing Comcast's proposed $45 billion purchase of another major cable-TV service, Time Warner Cable Inc.
