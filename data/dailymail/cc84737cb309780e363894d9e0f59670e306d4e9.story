Manchester City's squad have arrived in Abu Dhabi ahead of their post-season tour.

The players, fresh from their title parade through the streets of Manchester, arrived in the capital of the United Arab Emirates on Tuesday morning, before being immediately greeted by a swarm of autograph-hungry fans eager to greet the newly-crowned English champions.

The club plan to host an open training session for fans in the capital on Wednesday, before playing Al Ain - the team of former Sunderland and Ghana star Asamoah Gyan - a day later.

City will be playing the Arabian Gulf champions at their newly opened Hazza Bin Zayed stadium, a game they were due to play in January of this year, only to be held by Blackburn in the 3rd round of the FA Cup and have a replay scheduled at the same time as they were due to make the trip.

It seems as though the tour will be a 
fitting end to an excellent season for Manchester City, after adding the
 Premier League - which they regained following a 2-0 victory over West 
Ham on Sunday - to the Capital One Cup they won after beating Sunderland
 at Wembley in March.Â 

And it is expected that England stars Joe Hart and James Milner - after being called into Roy Hodgson's World Cup squad on Monday afternoon - will not play a part in Thursday's exhibition match. The Three Lions manager will be hoping both players will be fit ahead of their meeting up with the rest of the squad next Monday.
