For Kaljeet Bansal, the joy of passing her driving test at the first attempt was not to last long.

After buying a £400 secondhand car, the 18-year-old went online to sort out her insurance – and that's where her problems began.

For the first quote she got for her 800cc Daewoo Matiz, which should be in one of the lowest insurance categories, was an astonishing £33,000.

Shocked: Only two car insurance companies offered Kaljeet Bansal, 18, a quote - the cheapest was almost £20,000

Astronomical: Miss Bansal was looking to insure a Daewoo Matiz with an 800cc engine worth just £400

And the premium offered by a second 
firm was a similarly unaffordable £20,000. Kaljeet, who is taking her 
A-levels this year, said: 'When I saw the numbers come up on my laptop 
screen I thought it must be a mistake.

'But I've tried it four times now and it's the same every time.'

After passing her test last week, the 
schoolgirl used price comparison websites, including confused.com, to 
seek quotes – and only two companies offered to cover her.

Goodgirl.co.uk quoted the teenager 
from Harehills, Leeds, £19,997 (or £21,687 for monthly instalments) and 
Flux Direct, £33,845 (or £37,900 for monthly instalments).

Her brother Pardeep Bansal, 28, a 
forklift truck driver, asked his own insurance company for a quote but 
was told it could not cover her.

Disappointed: Miss Bansal had been hoping having a car would help her find a job, but now she will have to do without

He said: 'I thought she must have put 
the details in wrong, like she'd accidentally put that she's got a 
gold-plated Rolls-Royce or something.

'But we've checked so many times. 
There is no justification for charging that kind of money. The Starship 
Enterprise would be cheaper to insure.'

He added: 'It might be because of the area, her age or the car. The area used to be rough but now it's not as bad.'

A Flux Direct spokesman said the 
company always tried to provide a quote and often it was reduced once it
could further evaluate the risks.

Goodgirl.co.uk refused to comment.

An Association of British Insurers 
spokesman said it was 'acutely aware that premiums like this are off the
scale', but said young drivers were five times more likely to be in a 
serious crash where there was a personal injury award of £500,000 plus.

The average annual insurance bill for women aged 17 to 20 is £2,256 – up 20.7 per cent on a year ago.
