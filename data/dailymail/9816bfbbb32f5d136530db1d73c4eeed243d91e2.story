David Cameron and Barack Obama will today prepare the ground for multi-national air strikes against Islamic State and for sending troops to form a Nato training force in Iraq.

There is intense pressure on Mr Cameron and the US President to use a Nato summit to act decisively against the ‘terrorist state’.

In Britain, cross-party support for joining US military action was increasing.

Multi-national effort? David Cameron is facing intense pressure to act decisively against ISIS by joining the US in launching air strikes. Meanwhile, as he heads to the Nato summit, Obama is being accused of indecision

With world leaders gathered in Wales, the Prime Minister will argue for a multi-national effort to crush jihadist forces who have already murdered two Americans and are threatening to kill a British hostage. 

He told the Commons he has no doubt that millions of dollars raised by IS – also called Isil or Isis – from ransom payments is used to promote terrorism affecting the UK.

And he said Britain will continue with its policy of not paying ransoms to terrorist kidnappers, adding the UK needed to ensure that other countries were also ‘good to their word’.

A video showing the beheading of American journalist Steven Sotloff also included IS extremists threatening a UK hostage.

At Prime Minister’s Questions, Mr Cameron said: ‘There’s no doubt that the many tens of millions of dollars that Isil has raised from ransom payments is going into promoting terrorism, including terrorism affecting our own country.’

He said that at last year’s G8 summit he had ‘launched an initiative to try to get other countries to sign-up to a very clear doctrine that in the case of terrorist kidnap, no ransom should be paid.

‘Britain continues with this policy, America continues with his policy but we need to redouble the efforts to make sure other countries are good to their word.’

Pressure: Cameron told the Commons the UK will not cow to terrorists as he races to free a British hostage

Threats: An Islamic State fighter spoke with a British accent as he beheaded US journalist Steven Sotloff

Government sources suggested that as well as backing air attacks, in the longer term Britain was ready to contemplate putting boots back on the ground in Iraq in a potential Nato force to train Iraqi and Kurdish forces – if requested by Baghdad.

There is international dismay at the lack of a coherent strategy from America for tackling IS as the Sunni extremists killed thousands and seized large areas of Iraq and Syria.

Mr Obama and Mr Cameron are today expected to insist that Western allies stand shoulder to shoulder in the fight against IS – and argue its forces pose a direct threat to British and US families.

The Prime Minister said: ‘A country like ours will not be cowed by these barbaric killers. If they think we will weaken in the face of their threats, they are wrong.

‘It will have the opposite effect. We will be more forthright in the defence of the values, liberty under the rule of law, freedom, democracy that we hold dear.’

He told MPs that the fight against Islamic extremism is akin to a new Cold War, and could last for many years.

‘It is not unlike the Cold War, where we did not just pursue those who wanted to do us such harm, we also had to challenge all those who gave them succour. That is what we need to do in a struggle which, as I have said, I think will last for decades.’

Determined: Government sources claim Obama will tell the summit, 'we'll win against the psychopaths'

Asked as he arrived for the summit in Newport if people can expect British involvement in air strikes, Mr Cameron said: ‘We must do what is in our national interest.’

However, he insisted that while Britain and the US stood ready to assist, regional powers must take the lead in tackling IS.

Government sources at the summit said Mr Cameron and Mr Obama’s message would be ‘we’ll win against the psychopaths’.

Former Labour foreign secretary Jack Straw said he believed the UK should join in air strikes, adding: ‘No one is more aware than I am of the legacy of the 2003 Iraq War. Of course we should learn from the past, [but] we should not be paralysed by the past. This is a threat to civilisation.’

He accused Mr Obama of being indecisive on foreign policy – a sentiment being expressed widely in London and Washington.

He said: ‘As much as I respect him, he’s very long on analysis, but he’s not quite as fleet of foot on being decisive. This Nato summit provides a clear opportunity for some very clear leadership by the United States.’

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg is understood to have indicated he is ready to back air strikes, and Labour also appears on the point of backing action.
