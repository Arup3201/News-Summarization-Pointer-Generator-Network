Britain's contributions to the European Union have topped £50 million a day for the first time, new figures revealed last night.

Figures released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that the UK’s contributions to Brussels rose by 5.7 per cent last year to a record £18.5 billion – double the Home Office Budget.

At the same time, the money Britain received back from the EU fell by almost a quarter to £8.1 billion, a fall of £2.6 billion in a year.

The trends meant that that the UK’s net contribution to Brussels rocketed by 54 per cent to £10.3 billion.

Nigel Farage, leader of the UK Independence Party last night said the figures would ‘rub salt in the wounds’ of people pressing for a referendum on Britain’s relationship with the EU.

Mr Farage said: ‘The figures speak for themselves. We are paying more than ever before for our EU membership and are getting less in return. 

‘This news is a kick in the teeth for the British people who are tightening their belts in these tough times.’

The figures are likely to strengthen the hand of Tory Eurosceptics who argue that Britain is getting a raw deal from the EU.

They are also potentially embarrassing for David Cameron, who has just agreed a two per cent budget increase for the European Commission next year, which will cost British taxpayers an extra £300 million.

The Prime Minister has said his focus now is to prevent a major rise in the EU’ s budget for the seven-year period after 2014.

The new figures relate to the calendar year 2010.

Britain’s gross contributions increased partly because of the decline in the value of the pound against the euro.

The dramatic decline in receipts from the EU results mainly from a controversial deal struck by Tony Blair to hand back part of the annual rebate famously secured by Margaret Thatcher in 1984.

Under the terms of the 1984 deal Britain is repaid two thirds of the difference between what it pays out to Brussels and what it receives back. Last year this was worth £5 billion.

But under the new arrangement struck by Mr Blair the formula no longer apply to billions of pounds of the EU budget used to fund regeneration projects in poorer member states such as Greece and the former communist regimes in Eastern Europe.

The new figures also suggest the the Office for Budget Responsibility is likely to have underestimated the future cost of the EU.

The OBR’s latest forecast is for our net contributions to the EU to hit the £10.3 billion mark in 2014.
