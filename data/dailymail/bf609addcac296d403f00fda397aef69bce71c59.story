A huge collection of 84 designer handbags goes up for auction on Christie's website from 2pm today.

With prices starting at just £400, those with a fetish for designer arm candy but a shoestring budget to match might be in with a chance of snapping up a bargain from the London auction house.

The online-only event, dubbed Vintage Couture: Handbags and Accessories, includes luxury handbags by Hermès, Chanel and Louis Vuitton and closes on Monday, 24 June at 2pm.

To by and Hermès bag today could mean 
being on a waiting list for months but now Christie's offers the 
opportunity to snap one up immediately.

Here, Femail exclusively shows you a selection of the bags going to the highest bidder.

The highest lot in the sale is an amethyst matte crocodile Birkin Hermès bag with an

expect the entire auction total to raise in the region of £400,000.

The handbags feature among an enticing collection of 102 
exquisite items, including a variety of day wear, larger luggage, jewellery 
and limited edition pieces by iconic labels including Chanel and Louis Vuitton.

Bidding
opens today and will run for 10 days providing opportunities for those 
around the world to land some of the most sought-after designs ever 
created, with some dating back to the 1950s.

Highlights include 40 classic Birkin 
and Kelly bags covering a spectrum of bright spectacular colours to brighten up summer 
wardrobes and a stunning selection of exotic leathers. The price points ensure there is 
something for all tastes and budgets.

'Hermès is known as the leading luxury handbag designer and it is unsurprising that the iconic Birkin and Kelly designs continue to thrive at auction,' says Pat Frost, director of Christie's fashion department.

'Exquisite quality is at the heart of Hermès handbags and this sale offers the crème de la crème of Hermès designs with a number of timeless pieces and rare exotic leathers.

'The online-only format of this sale follows hot on the heels of our successful Vintage Couture: Handbags, Luggage and Accessories sale in April this year.

'This sale which runs for 10 days provides another extended opportunity for buyers around the world to purchase handbags and accessories by some of the greatest designers of all time.'

Kelly and Birkin bags continue to be highly sought-after and have become increasingly popular since they were first designed.

Birkin
bags were inspired by English actress and singer Jane Birkin in the 
1980s. In a chance encounter with the former Hermès CEO on an airplane, 
the celebrity suggested the design for a weekend bag, which paved the 
way for the consistently popular ‘Birkin’ bag.

The
Kelly bag was named after Grace Kelly, who in 1956 had just become 
Princess of Monaco and was seen carrying the original leather 'Sac à 
dépêche' to hide her pregnancy. Photographs of the young starlet were 
sent all over the world, leading to the bag being known as the Kelly. 
Originally designed in 1935 the shape is a classic form which has gained
worldwide acclaim.

Chanel,
ever practical, introduced a handbag suspended from thin straps in 
1929, as an alternative to the clutch - freeing up the busy 
woman-about-town’s hands for other things.  When she returned from 
retirement in 1954, Chanel decided to update her handbag even further 
and called the bag 2.55 after the date of creation, February 1955.

The
2.55 remains the most popular bag today, both vintage and new.  

In 
fact, Chanel released an exact copy of the original 2.55 in February 
2005 to commemorate the bag’s 50th birthday. It remains a design 
classic, with its quilted exterior and double chain straps.  Fans will 
know that the burgundy leather interiors were said to be inspired by 
Chanel’s convent school uniform and that when this bag has the 
‘Mademoiselle’ lock, it is known as a ‘Classic Flap’.  The Double C lock
was introduced in the 1980s. This sale includes several variants of 
the 2.55. 

Lot 18: An emerald fabric classic flap bag Chanel, 2009-10 with silvertone metal hardware, classic chain, dustbag and box 30.5 cm, estimate: £1,500 - 2,500

Lot 65: An Hermès tan box lather passe-guide bag from 1979, estimated to fetch £2,500 - £3,500

The Vintage Couture: Handbags and Accessories online-only auction features 102 exquisite items. Lot 18: A 30cm 2011 lime bag, estimate £10,000-£15,000 (left) and Lot 34: A crocus 2012 with silver palladium hardware, padlock, keyfob and dustbag 35 cm, estimate: £5,000-£7,000 (right), both Epsom leather Birkins by Hermès

Man In A Vuitton Bag at Bonhams is a rare collection of 'the world's chicest magazine' - and it's going under the hammer.

It sold its entire 2,500 print run in less than three weeks and is now to be sold at the Bonhams Books, Maps, Manuscripts and Photographs sale in Knightsbridge on Wednesday 19 June. 

It is part of a collection of 53 issues of Visionaire, for sale as one lot, estimated at £15,000-20,000.

Visionaire was first published in 1991 and has appeared three times a year in numbered, limited editions ever since.
