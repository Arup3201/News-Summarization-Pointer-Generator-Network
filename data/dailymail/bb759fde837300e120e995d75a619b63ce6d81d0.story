A hard-charging 6-year-old girl in Portland has helped police recover one of her dad's stolen bicycles — all by shaming the thieves with a stern sign.

Roxy Thompson, 6, sprung into action a few weeks ago when thieves stole thousands of dollars in custom road bikes from the garage of her home.

She wrote the looters a large sign and displayed it in the middle of the front yard:

'Shame on you bike thieves!!!' wrote Roxy, according to KATU.
 'Your mom would be so disappointed! Even if she was a villain, she still
 wouldn't want you to be a villain too!

'Sincerely, your resident 
6-year-old.'

Six-year-old Roxy used a yard sign to help police in Portland track down one of the bikes that was stolen from her dad

Roxy sprung to action when she saw how sad her dad Rob was, after looters took half a dozen custom bikes from his garage

'It hurt my feelings that my dad was so angry and sad,' Roxy told the station.

Roxy's sign brought in a handful of tips, including a picture of a bike similar to the ones stolen from the girl's house.

Portland cops tracked down the people in the photo and discovered they had bought the road bike off the street for $50.

One of the department's detectives, Travis Field, hand-delivered the bike to Roxy.

'Six-year-olds can do amazing things,' Sergeant Pete Simpson, of the Portland PD, told KATU.

'I 
talked to the detective, he said she was thrilled,' he added. 'It’s empowering for 
her and she knows people do care and police were working hard to help.'

Roxy's dad, Rob Thompson, couldn't be prouder.

'At first, she offered to give me her life savings,' Thompson, who is yet to recover a few of his other bikes, told KATU. 'That was a heart melter.'
