Travel and technology company Teague have created an innovative new airplane interior which could revolutionise the way football teams and athletes travel around the world.

Football managers across the globe have often complained about the amount of air miles their players have to clock up during different spells of the season.

There's little doubt that long journeys can hamper the performance of athletes, but Teague, in conjunction with Nike, have developed an idea that they claim will 'preserve peak performance'. 

Innovation: Travel and technology company Teague have unveiled an airplane cabin to help professional athletes preserve their peak before and after performance 

Recover: The 'Athlete's Plane' has been designed with the effects of air travel on professional athletes in mind and features a variety of post-match necessities

Rest: Teague claim the airplane will help players' recovery, circulation, sleep and thinking all while they travel to and from destinations

The 'Athlete's Plane' is designed to provide pre and post performance necessities which could make air travel an ideal place for injured or tired players to begin their recovery on the way home after the game.

The Teague mode of travel would have been ideal for football players during the recent international break as top European clubs had to watch on as their players travelled thousands of miles to play in friendly matches.

For example, Brazil have played two games in Miami over the past five days meaning the Premier League, La Liga and Bungesliga's Brazilian contingents will have clocked up over 8,000 air miles before attempting to be available for selection in their domestic leagues this weekend.

Future? Amenities include lie-flat seating to accommodate athletic builds, compression sleeves to ice sore muscles and biometric testing and analysis in-flight

Vital: The lie-flat seating has been designed to accommodate athletic builds as players look to rest while clocking up the air miles

Globetrotters: Top European clubs will no doubt be interested in such a design as players and staff travel across the globe so often

Teague aim to make such journeys easier for the players with lie-flat seating, compression sleeves for sore muscles, a seperate cabin which cancels out any noise and an area to enable in-flight analysis and testing.

Such an idea could also stop the constant battle between international teams and domestic clubs as managers often look to keep their players at home if possible.

Teague's creative director Philipp Steiner said: When professional athletes travel across multiple time zones their team is statistically more likely to lose - the Athlete's Plane essentially levels the playing field'.

Knowledge: Teague have worked closely with sports manufacturers Nike as well as former athletes to discover what is needed during a post-performance flight

Chance: Teague's creative director Philipp Steiner believes the 'Athlete's Plane' levels the playing field for away team having to travel long distances

Tired legs: Brazilian players will clock up around 8,000 air miles each as they travel from international duty in Miami back to their teams in Europe
