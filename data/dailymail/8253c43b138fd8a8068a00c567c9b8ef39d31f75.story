The tradition of embarrassing fathers is alive and kicking in Britain today a survey has revealed.

In fact British teenagers find their fathers so embarrassing that they stay an average of 6.7 metres away from them if they are out together in public, for fear of being seen by friends.

But maybe the kids should be more grateful as it transpires that the average father also does 627 ‘dad miles’ every year on weekends, ferrying teens to and from parties and other social gatherings, often very late into the evening.

British teens implement a 6.7m exclusion zone for fear of being seen by friends in public with their dads

One West London father of four, Jeremy Duncan, said that he had taken to answering the phone 'Duncan’s Taxis' after 10pm on Friday and Saturday nights in the certain knowledge that it would be a request for a lift from one of his teenage kids. 

Jeremy said: 'I have noticed that my teenage kids tend to keep their distance when we’re out and about.

Fathers are still embarrassing their offspring in much the same manner as also

'I don’t take it personally because I remember doing it myself from time to time, as we all do.

'Maybe Father’s Day should be the one day in the year when we agree a bit of a temporary truce and call a halt to No Dads Land in public.'

In an attempt to show the lack of appreciation father's usually receive, another father lists a selection of texts from his teenage children which include such gems as: 'Eggs, bacon, butter, bread. Tx', 'Waiting on cod,' 'Is there a meal of sorts?,' and 'Any chance of a lift?'.

Britain’s long-suffering fathers fall well behind their female counterparts in the thank you stakes as well.

Market data from the UK Greeting Card Association reveals that 22 million Father’s Day cards were sent in 2013, less than half the number sent to mothers on Mother’s Day.

Tim Fairs, director at Clinton’s, said: 'Father’s Day is the one day in the year devoted to dads.

'What we’re hoping is that kids will recognise that their dads have their hearts in the right place even if their behavior sometimes leaves a little to be desired. 

'Mums, of course, are the biggest influence in most kids’ lives, but in many families dads are important ‘support staff’ that deserve a bit of thanks from time to time.'
