Gus Poyet says he hates the trend of footballers betraying dressing-room secrets in their best-selling books.

Former Sunderland boss Roy Keane has spoken candidly about his time at the club in his autobiography, The Second Half, including his anger when ABBA’s Dancing Queen was played in the dressing-room before one match.

Poyet has no problem with ABBA – he went to see the tribute musical Mamma Mia in London – but does take issue with the growing culture of former players and managers revealing stories which he believes should remain private.

‘I am not a fan of people writing books - I hate (those) books,’ said the Uruguayan, who takes his 13th-placed Black Cats to Southampton.

‘You can’t say one day that “what happens in the dressing room stays in the dressing room”, then write a book. I don’t like it.

‘It doesn’t matter who you are, who wrote it, how much money you got or whether you give it to charity – I don’t care. I don’t like the books. Although mine would make a good one!’

Poyet, though, will not be writing his own memoirs, nor will he be reading Keane’s.

‘I’m sorry Roy, I won’t be buying your book,’ he said.

‘I enjoy telling stories when I am having dinner or a barbecue – that’s the best part of fans and friends listening to you telling a story, but not going public like that.’

And, on the subject of dressing-room music, he added: ‘I went to see Mamma Mia and I enjoyed it. But no, I don’t have an ABBA CD.

‘We still have music in the dressing-room. They boys decide between themselves and I haven’t heard anything that has upset me.

‘Me? I like to talk, so too much music means I cannot talk. But I also think the music can hide the silence in the dressing-room. If there is silence you sometimes worry as a manager. Music can bring a bit of atmosphere and I don’t mind that.’

Former Manchester United stars Wes Brown and John O'Shea will form Sunderland's defence against Saints

Poyet, meanwhile, will pair Wes Brown, 35, with his former Manchester United team-mate John O’Shea, 33, at the heart of Sunderland’s defence on Saturday.

O’Shea signed a two-year extension to his current contract this week and Poyet is delighted with his veteran duo.

‘I think the hunger is the most important thing,’ he said.

‘When you win, win, win, you can relax, but these two are not that type of characters. That’s very good because they want to keep playing, keep fit and keep helping the team.

‘The way they conduct themselves is exactly what you want to see from your senior players.’
