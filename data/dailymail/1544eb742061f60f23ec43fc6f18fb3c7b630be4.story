'We've got some high instability in 
the area, which could lead to some thunder and lightning accompanying 
the snow. When that happens you're talking two to three inch per hour 
snowfall rates even over a short period of time,' said ABC7 Meteorologist Mike Caplan.

Monday's heaviest snow is expected to fall in
 Wisconsin, northern Illinois and Michigan, where some locations may 
receive a half of a foot. Lengthy travel delays are likely in Chicago, 
especially during the typically busy late-day commute.

'Even though the storm is forecast to 
move quickly, it will bring a moderate amount of snow or wintry mix to 
many communities from the Upper Midwest to the Northeast,' said AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Alex Sosnowski.

'In most cases, the storm will last six hours or less, but a few locations can receive just as many inches of snow.'

If the low temperatures and persistent snowfall continue, this winter is on track to be the third coldest on record, after 1979 and 1899.

Between three to six inches of snow are expected across the area.

The snow is coming from a low pressure 
system which will moved out of the Rockies across the central plains on 
Sunday night and will cross the Ohio River Valley on Monday.
