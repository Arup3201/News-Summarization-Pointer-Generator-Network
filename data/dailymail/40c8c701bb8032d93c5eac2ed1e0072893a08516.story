A newborn baby became Britain's youngest organ donor after her kidneys and liver were used to save the lives of two patients.

The kidneys, just three or four centimetres long, were transplanted into an victim of renal failure.

The liver cells, known medically as 'hepatocytes', were given to another seriously ill person.

Kidneys fully function at around 37 weeks in the womb and it is now hoped the delicate procedure will set a 'milestone' in organ donation.

The baby girl, who has not been identified, was born at Hammersmith Hospital, west London (pictured). She died a few days later, her brain having been starved of oxygen at some point in the pregnancy

A significant proportion of newborns who die in neonatal units could be potential organ donors, so they could save the lives of other sick patients.

The unidentified donor was a girl born at term after an emergency Caesarean section at Hammersmith Hospital, west London.

She weighed almost 7lbs (3.1kg) but was very sick, and it became clear her brain had been starved of oxygen for a period during the pregnancy.

Treatment made no difference, and repeated examinations showed she was unable to make any spontaneous movement, did not respond to any stimuli, and had fixed and dilated pupils.

The parents and medical staff involved in her care discussed the possibility of organ donation when it became clear she would not survive.

Supported by the organ donation team, the nursing staff, and the hospital's psychologist, the parents gave their consent for their daughter's kidneys and liver cells to be used for the benefit of other sick patients.

Dr Gaurav Atreja, of the neonatal unit at Hammersmith Hospital in west London, said the kidneys measured just three to four centimetres long and two centimetres wide. 

An adult's are about three times that size.

White liver cells, known medically as 'hepatocytes', were given to another seriously ill person.

He said: 'You can transplant a baby's kidneys into children or adults. I don't know exactly what size they will grow to but it is enough for them to function.

'And the liver cells can be transfused into the blood of patients with end stage liver failure to buy them time while they wait for a suitable donor.

'They are taken from a fresh liver and function as a substitute liver for a few weeks during that vital window. '

The baby, who was born midway through last year, died from a lack of oxygen to her brain. 

Dr Atreja said there are plenty of causes of oxygen starvation in the womb and he could not go into individual cases for 'confidential reasons' but it was a tragedy 'beyond our control.'

'The lack of oxygen means other organs could also have been damaged so we had to check which ones - if any - were suitable for transplantation and the kidneys and liver cells were.

He added that the parents of the baby were keen to go through with the procedure.

'When we explained to the parents of the baby girl it could be possible to save some lives with their help they were only too keen. 

'They came back wanting to speak to me again within a couple of hours.

'They didn't need any persuading - not that that is something we would ever try to do. It's a decision that has to come from the parents without any pressure.

'It's a very sensitive and difficult issue which is why we have a very experienced clinical psychologist to help them through the process.'

The case was reported in the Foetal & Neonatal Edition of Archives of Disease in Childhood.

Dr Atreja wrote: 'A very careful and realistic plan was prepared in association with the organ donation team and presented to the parents.'

After a specialist nurse from the National Health Service Blood and Transplant team did a full assessment of the infant's organs, it was agreed the kidneys and liver cells were retrievable and suitable recipients were located in the country.

Six days after she was born, and with death confirmed, these tissues were obtained with the help of an experienced surgeon from the National Organ Retrieval Service.

The team said: 'It is due to the extreme generosity of the parents and wonderful professional collaboration between the neonatal team and the organ donation team that this process was successful. 

'This case has set a milestone in the care of newborns in the UK.

'Cases such as this are rare but I hope other neonatal units will look at what we've done and consider doing similar things in the future.' 

They pointed out current advice makes it very difficult for donors to be identified.

New guidelines from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health are expected shortly, and these should help to standardise an approach to organ donation among newborns.

The child's kidneys, just three or four cm long, were transplanted into a victim of renal failure - and were big enough to function in an adult's body 

Experts hope this will also kick start a new way of thinking about neonatal organ donation.

The family of the baby were praised by NHS Blood and Transplant, the organisation that organised the retrieval of her kidneys and liver cells.

Professor James Neuberger, associate medical director for Organ Donation and Transplantation, said: 'We are pleased the first transplant of organs from a newborn was a success and we also praise the brave decision of the family to donate their baby's organs.

'Agreeing to donate happens at a heartbreaking time and in a family's life and our thoughts go out to all families that find themselves in this position.

'The sad reality is for everybody to get the lifesaving transplant they are desperately in need of, more families who are facing the tragic loss of their young child will need to agree to donation.'

There are currently 194 young people under the age of 18 waiting for a transplant - of whom 15 are babies under two.  

Professor Neuberger said: 'We welcome any  good to come out of their own personal tragedy.'

In October, healthcare assistant Samira Kauser, 22, hit the headlines when the kidneys of a five week old baby were transplanted into her at St James's University Hospital in Leeds.

After the seven hour operation she said: 'Words cannot express the gratitude I feel to the parents of this baby. 

'My life was standing still - now I can live it.'
