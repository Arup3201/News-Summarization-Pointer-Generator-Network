Many women who check their breasts for cancer are doing so incorrectly, a leading doctor warned today.

While many don't bother at all, many of those who do take the time are still at risk due to not being thorough enough.

Speaking on ITV's Lorraine, Dr Hilary Jones explained a monthly examination should take several  minutes - much longer than the cursory swipe many women may perform in the shower.

Of those who do check their breasts for cancer, many are doing so incorrectly. Instructing how to perform a live examination on the Lorraine show, Dr Hilary Jones explained a monthly check should take several minutes

Dr Hilary told presenter Lorraine Kelly: 'The key is to be breast aware - look at your breasts and feel them. Has anything changed? That's the vital thing'

To remind viewers what to do, and with the help of a female volunteer, he instructed how to perform a breast examination.

When he did the same last year, it led to many women being diagnosed, including viewer Lisa Maddison. 

Watching at home, she realised that like many women, she too was going about the process incorrectly.  

Today, as he reminded viewers of the correct procedure, Dr Hilary told presenter Lorraine Kelly: 'The key is to be breast aware - look at your breasts and feel them. Has anything changed? That's the vital thing.'

He added: 'Bear in mind, periods will change things, so wait until a week after your period to check. 

'And remember one woman will have different consistency breasts compared to someone else - some have soft balloons, others lumpy beanbags. 

'You need to know what's normal for you so you can detect change. After the menopause, for example, breasts become softer, less firm and less lumpy,' he said. 

With the help of the model, Sue, Dr Hilary then proceeded to show viewers exactly how to perform a breast examination.  

DR HILARY'S GUIDE TO BREAST EXAMINATION 

* Stand with your hand on your hip to relax the muscles on that side of the chest

* Divide the breast tissue into four quadrants: a line across the nipple, a line through the nipple, one coming vertically across and all the way up to the collar and under the armpit. 

* Using the soft pads of your three middle fingers, examine each quarter in a grid search.

* It's important to go all the way up to the collarbone and feel the lymph nodes under the armpit. Around 50 per cent of breast cancers occur in this outer quadrant and the enlarged lymph glands are a sign.  Don't just feel around the nipple and forget the armpit. 

* Do a superficial feel on the surface first and then press deeper.

* Spend three minutes on each side, doing each quarter in turn, getting right into the tail of each breast.

* When you come to the nipples, feel under the areola.

* It's also important to watch out for a rash or discharge, such as that which is milky, straw coloured or bleeding - and tell your doctor. 

* Overall, watch for a change in the shape or contour of breasts - one may be asymmetrical compared to the other. 

* Check for puckering or dimpling of the skin - perhaps because something is pulling underneath. 

It's important to go all the way up to the collarbone and feel the lymph nodes under the armpit. Around 50 per cent of breast cancers occur in this outer quadrant, Dr Hilary said

Lisa Maddison discovered a lump in her breast after watching a breast cancer examination last year 

Lisa Maddison was watching Lorraine last year during Breast Cancer Awareness Month and realised she too had been checking herself incorrectly.

After following the technique shown by Dr Hilary, she discovered a lump - and was diagnosed with cancer.

Speaking a year on, she said: 'I've realised since then that many women - and men - don't check their breasts at all, if properly. 

'After watching Dr Hilary, I used the technique he showed and found a large lump on my left-hand side.'

Two weeks later, she was diagnosed with cancer and has since gone through six months of chemotherapy and three weeks of radiation therapy.

Now on the hormone drug Tamoxifen to prevent the cancer recurring, she said: 'I have daughters and I urge them and other people to check themselves.

'We must be more aware - the amount of people who aren't [is worrying].' 

However after treatment, she is on the road to recovery, and said today: 'I feel absolutely smashing. Life is great at the minute.'

As part of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, women are being asked to donate unwanted bras to donate towards further breast cancer research. 

Under the Bin Your Bra campaign, unwanted bras will be shipped to Africa where they will be recycled. The money generated will go towards new and ongoing research.

Bras can be left at any of the 535 F&F clothing sections of Tescos across the UK and Ireland.
