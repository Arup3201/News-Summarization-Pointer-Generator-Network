They are known as man's best friend.

And this is particularly true after years of faithful companionship.

Now, devoted dog owners have put forward their aging pets for a series of majestic portraits.

The stunning collection, named 'Old Faithful Photo Project, features a range of senior canines, including a cancer-stricken English Bulldog and a 12-year-old old Chihuahua with one eye.

Majestic: This  collection of portraits, created by 35-year-old photographer Pete Thorne and named 'Old Faithful Photo Project, features a range of aging canines, including a 12-year-old old Chihuahua with one eye (above)

Sick: It also includes a cancer-stricken English Bulldog named Mance (above), which has an 'asymmetrical charm', according to Mr Thorne. Due to Mance's fragility, the photo shoot was based at the owner's house

A natural: This photo shows Weezee, a 10-year-old Pug, who was well behaved and 'very easy to photograph'

Ageing: Finnegan, a Brussels Griffon smooth coat or a Petit Brabançon, is 12 years old. He sports a red coat, weighs 6lbs and is small for his breed. He also has a heart murmur and has had multiple teeth pulled out

Stunning: Mr Thorne is a big fan of puppies, but thought it was time to give their older counterparts - including this dog named Spud - a shot at the spotlight. He later posted the impressive portraits on his Facebook page

Posing: This Chinese Crested dog, named Colonel Sanders, is a purebred show dog with best in show lineage dating back several generations to Asia. Due to old age, his shallow-rooted teeth are slowly falling out

It also includes a 14-year-old therapy dog named Dallas, a 16-year-old Cairn Terrier mix, several Chinese Crested canines and a camera-friendly Pug called Weezee.

The  pictures were captured by Pete Thorne, a 35-year-old photographer from Toronto who is a big fan of puppies, but thought it was time to give their older counterparts a shot at the spotlight.

Alongside the regal-looking images, posted on Mr Thorne's Facebook page, many owners have written short biographies for their four-legged pets, some of which have since passed away. 

'We no longer chase squirrels, only hunt them down with intense staring,' one person wrote of Bodley, a 12-year-old boxer-Staffordshire terrier mix.

Smiling: Another image depicts Elmo (above), a 14-year-old Pitbull who was the first dog shot by Mr Thorne

Getting on: Hogarth - aka 'Mr Fusspot' - was also pictured by the photographer for the 'Old Faithful' project

Greying: Mason, an 11-year-old Chocolate Labrador, was put forward for the project by his owner, Judith

Saved: Toto, 16, a Cairn Terrier mix, was rescued by a vet when he was seven years old. He was scheduled to be euthanized due to urination issues, but the vet refused to go through with it and instead took him home

'Though his arthritis limits his flexibility, it does not limit his enthusiasm for walks and exploration through brown crunchy leaves.'

Another owner said of a 14-year-old therapy dog called Dallas: 'At age 11 she was diagnosed with Auto-immune Encephaliti.! Her neurologist didn't expect her to survive.

'But she proved him wrong and rallied through the disease and has been in great health since. She still enjoys trotting about for a ball, swimming and an occasional squirrel stalk.' 

Deep in thought: Speaking of Jackson (pictured),  a 14-year-old Black Labrador mix, Mr Thorne said: 'There's something about the expression on his face that seems like he is peering into your soul'

A final photo: Clovis, 14, sadly passed away not too long after this breathtaking portrait of him was taken

Adopted: Benjamin was found as a stray and ended up in a shelter before his owner, Sandy, adopted him

Less active: 'We no longer chase squirrels, only hunt them down with intense staring,' one person wrote of Bodley (pictured), a 12-year-old boxer-Staffordshire terrier mix who was pictured by Mr Thorne

Although not his original intention, Mr Thorne has grown to realize the lasting impact of his portraits, particularly those featuring now-deceased pets. 

Many owners have followed up with him after their dogs have died, telling him the incredible stories of their companionship, some of which involve animals being rescued from pet mills or the streets.  

Mr Thorne hopes 'Old Faithful' will one day be featured as a gallery show or published as a book.

Showing off her fangs: Sheba, one of the first dogs photographed, was described by Mr Thorne as 'a bit frail'

Excitable: Emmy, a Wolfhound mix, 'got so excited for her photo shoot she pooped in a shoe', said Mr Thorne
