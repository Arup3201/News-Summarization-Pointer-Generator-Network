Prime Minister Tony Abbott has warned of a long, hot summer as he opened a Sydney swimming pool, but steered clear of mentioning climate change.

'It's going to be a hot summer,' he said at the Hornsby Aquatic Centre on Saturday.

But the prime minister was quick to add: 'How many Australian summers are not hot summers?'

His comments came as Sydneysiders brace themselves ahead of the high temperatures on Sunday, with the city expected to reach 35C and up to 40C forecast in the west.

While making his poolside speech Mr Abbott admitted he was resisting the temptation to slip on a pair of his trademark Speedos and have a dip, with a member of the public shouting out, 'I've got a pair of cossies for you'.

But the Mr Abbott said he would remain in his suit and tie.

'Just for once I'm going to resist the temptation,' he said.

Mr Abbott's comments about the hot summer also came after his foreign minister Julie Bishop challenged US President Barack Obama over a climate change speech he made on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Brisbane.

In that speech Mr Obama raised concerns about the impact of climate change on the Great Barrier Reef, but Ms Bishop said there was an 'issue' regarding the president's statement.

‘I can understand the Queensland Government’s concern because the Queensland government and Australia have committed significant resources, funding and effort to preserving and conserving the Great Barrier Reef,’ she told host Leigh Sales.

‘Indeed, I believe that we are demonstrating world’s best practise in working with the World Heritage Committee to ensure that the Great Barrier Reef is preserved for generations to come.

‘And I think that president Obama might have overlooked that aspect of our commitment to conserving the Great Barrier Reef.’

President Barack Obama raised concerns at G20 about the impact of climate change on Great Barrier Reef

Last Saturday President Obama told an audience at the University of Queensland that no country was immune to the effects of climate change and that everyone must play a role in fighting the global phenomena.

'Here in the Asia Pacific, nobody has more at stake when it comes to thinking about and then acting on climate change,' he said during his speech.

'Here in Australia, it means longer droughts, more wildfires – The incredible natural glory of the Great Barrier Reef is threatened.

‘I have not had time to go to the Great Barrier Reef and I want to come back and I want my daughters to be able to come back and I want them to be able to bring their daughters or sons to visit and I want that there 50 years from now.
