It is a stunning Tudor summer house, set amid the splendour of 'Britain's finest Elizabethan garden'.

That's how a planning inspector described this National Trust property – before granting permission  for four huge wind turbines on nearby land.

The Trust is furious at the decision, which it says will blight the historic building's setting and spell disaster for other heritage sites.

The future: How Lyveden New Bield in Northamptonshire could look when the wind farm is installed, to the horror of the National Trust

Protests: Peter Stephens, chairman of Stop Barnwell Wind Farm Committee - which opposed the development - at Lyveden New Bield

But their fears for Lyvden New Bield 
in Northamptonshire were dismissed on the grounds that the Government's 
green targets – to produce 15 per cent of energy from renewable sources 
by 2020 – must come first.

The Planning Inspectorate granted a 
company permission to build the 125metre-high turbines just over half a 
mile from the property, as well as an access road, mast and underground 
cables. It allowed the application on appeal after it was rejected by 
East Northamptonshire Council last year.

Inspector Paul Griffiths acknowledged that 'irreplaceable' historic assets should receive the highest level of protection.

He even conceded that the turbines 
would be clearly visible from the estate and surrounding villages and be
an 'alien and incongruous' presence in the historic landscape.

Mr Griffiths noted that the garden was
described as 'probably the finest surviving example of an Elizabethan 
Garden', and that Lyveden New Bield has a 'cultural value of national, 
if not international significance'.

Despite this, he concluded: 'The 
significant benefits of the proposal in terms of the energy it would 
produce from a renewable source outweigh the less than substantial harm 
it would cause to the setting.'

Dame Fiona Reynolds, director-general 
of the National Trust, said: 'This decision is a landmark case which 
undermines the protection of our heritage sites.

'It provides a clear indication that 
our cultural heritage is at great risk from inappropriately sited wind 
turbines and wind farms. If the impacts here are not such to amount to 
substantial harm on our nation's heritage, it is difficult to conceive 
where they would be.

'The site has the highest heritage designation possible, putting it on a par with places like Hampton Court.'

'Unique': The Government said Lyveden New Bield was arguably the most ambitious and unusual surviving example of an Elizabethan garden in England

UN carbon trade 'is a failure'

Barnwell Manor Wind Farm was opposed 
by many local residents and by local MP Louise Mensch.  It would be 
built on neighbouring land owned by the Queen's cousin the Duke of 
Gloucester, by West Coast Energy based in Mold, North Wales.

The Duke and Duchess live in an apartment at Kensington Palace and lease out their 2,500-acre estate near Oundle.

West Coast Energy said the turbines 
would produce ten megawatts, enough to supply the needs of 5,730 homes a
year and 'produce affordable, secure and renewable energy for 
generations to come'.

The house was begun in the late 1500s 
by local sheriff Sir Thomas Tresham, a devout Roman Catholic who imbued 
the design with religious significance. It was left unfinished when he 
died in 1605.

The National Trust discovered the 
remains of an Elizabethan pleasure garden in the grounds of the manor 
and restored its moats, terraces and apple orchards in the original 
style.

Onshore wind power sites are highly 
controversial and only around 25 per cent of proposals for them are 
being approved, according to Renewable UK.

But many more are being allowed on 
appeal and campaigners fear the ability of councils to ban them is being
undermined by aggressive energy firms and the proposed changes to 
planning laws.
