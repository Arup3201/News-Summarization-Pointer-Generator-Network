Josh Powell's mother yesterday spoke out and said that her son would not be buried with her grandsons, whom he killed in an explosive house fire.

Terri Powell had bought a burial plot for Josh in the same Washington cemetery as his sons Charlie, seven, and five-year-old Braden - a decision which her son-in-law said was 'clueless'.

But this news provoked outrage from the relatives of Powell's missing wife Susan - and members of the public, including police officers, bought plots surrounding the boys' graves to ensure that their father could not be buried there.

Happier times: Josh Powell blew up the property when he found out he was not getting custody of his two sons

Now Terri Powell has confirmed that 
the family has given up a plot at Woodbine Cemetery, overlooking the 
boys' graves, which was tentatively reserved for their father.

'We have tried so hard to be loving 
and considerate and respectful in making Josh's burial arrangements,' 
she said in a written statement.

'We love our little Charlie and Braden and want their resting place to be a place of peace and comfort.'

Powell's grave had already been dug 
earlier this week, and a city official said at the time that the 
cemetery had no policy on blocking individual burials.

Preventative measure: Crimestoppers has purchased the plots on either side of the gravesite of Charlie and Braden Powell (shown still covered by a cemetery canopy)

Empty plot: A cement cover is placed on top of an empty grave that has been reserved for Josh Powell up the hill, but not alongside the boys' grave, shown left under the canopy

Powell killed his sons and himself in a gas-fueled blaze two weeks ago at a home he was renting in Graham, Washington.

More than 1,000 mourners attended the
boys' funeral on Saturday. They were later buried in a single casket at
Woodbine, a municipal cemetery in Puyallup.

Terri Powell, wracked by grief, 
realized early this week that no one else was planning for what to do 
with Josh Powell's remains, said her son-in-law, Kirk Graves.

She visited a funeral home and a few 
cemeteries, he added, and she 'cluelessly' picked a gravesite just up 
the hill from where the boys are buried.

Loss: Susan Powell's parents Chuck and Judy Cox remember their grandsons, seven-year-old Charlie and five-year-old Braden, during their funeral service on February 11

Senseless: The casket bearing the bodies of Charlie and Braden Powell is shown during a funeral service for the boys in Tacoma, Washington on Saturday

The decision prompted a public 
firestorm. The parents of Susan Powell threatened legal action to keep 
Josh Powell from being buried so close, and the anti-crime organisation 
Crime Stoppers of Tacoma-Pierce County purchased the plots on either 
side of the boys to ensure that he didn't wind up next to them.

Crime Stoppers raised about $20,000 in donations for the effort in less than a day.

'We felt very strongly that it wasn't
appropriate to put him anywhere near the boys, and we did our best over
the last 48 hours to convince her to do something different,' Mr Graves
said.

'It wasn't that hard to convince her - she just got started off on the wrong path.'

Attorney Steve Downing, who represents Susan Powell's parents, Charles and Judy Cox, said they were immensely relieved.

Sham: The house that Josh Powell blew up to kill himself and his two sons was used as a ruse for social workers. He did not live there but placed photographs around to give the impression he did

Inferno: At a meeting for residents, police said Powell slashed the boys with a hatchet before lighting gasoline

Destroyed: The house, which neighbours thought was empty and abandoned, exploded within seconds

Questions: Powell was the sole person of interest in the case of his missing wife Susan

Josh Powell was a suspect in Susan 
Powell's 2009 disappearance from their home in West Valley City, Utah. 
He had always claimed that he didn't know what happened to his wife.

He took the boys - then 2 and 4 - on a
midnight camping trip in freezing weather in the Utah desert, he said, 
and when he returned home the next day authorities were at the house 
looking for her.

Weeks later, he moved the boys to his
father's home in Puyallup. After Steve Powell's arrest on voyeurism and
child pornography charges last fall, the boys were removed from the 
house and turned over to the Coxes.

A social worker brought them to Josh Powell's rental home for what was supposed to be a court-sanctioned supervised visit.

Josh Powell let the boys inside, 
locked the social worker out, hit them with a hatchet and set fire to 
gasoline, authorities said.

A judge had recently ordered that 
Josh Powell undergo a psycho-sexual evaluation if he hoped to regain 
custody, and in a last-minute message to his sister he said he couldn't 
live without his boys.

Steve Powell remains in custody, and authorities are interested in knowing whether he has information about Susan Powell's fate.

On Tuesday, he filed a written notice
in Pierce County Superior Court asserting his constitutional right to 
remain silent and not discuss any matters with Utah, Washington or 
federal law enforcement.
