A brilliant Cambridge University student has been jailed for sitting English exams on behalf of illegal immigrants as part of a sophisticated people-smuggling scam.

Junhua Yu, 24, who was studying for an MA in architecture at Darwin College, posed as a series of different Chinese nationals using fake passports.

After Yu passed the exams on their behalf, the bogus students would be granted student visas allowing them to remain in the UK.

Police, acting on a tip-off, arrested Yu after he sat an English language examination at the City of Norwich School using a fake passport.

Officers later discovered a shoebox containing six counterfeit Chinese passports hidden in Yu's wardrobe.

He was jailed for one year after 
admitting possessing an identification document with improper intention 
and conspiracy to facilitate the commission of a breach of UK 
immigration law.

Charles Myatt, prosecuting, told Cambridge Crown Court: 'Police were called to the City of Norwich School after suspicions were raised about an examinee sitting an English examination for Chinese nationals.

'After the exam had finished, police approached Yu and asked him if he had just sat the exam on behalf of someone else. He replied 'yes'.'

Defending, Michael Duffy, claimed Yu was not the main organiser of the scam.

He told the court: 'He was sent a link on the internet offering him cash to sit these exams.

'He was short of money and rather foolishly succumbed to temptation. It's fair to say his entire studies have pretty much been wasted now.'

The number of potentially bogus colleges,
that could be allowing illegal immigrants into Britain on student visas has fallen 
by almost 95 per cent.

Recent changes mean the government now has right to refuse student visas to applicants applying to non-accredited institutions.

In
2002, the language teaching association English UK created a database 
of 560 non-accredited English language schools after concerns were 
raised that the system was being abused.

Since new rules were 
brought in, the vast majority of colleges previously operating as 
non-accredited institutions, had either gone out of business entirely, 
switched to recruiting students from the EU only or became accredited.

Tony
Millns, Chief Executive of English UK, wrote to minister of 
immigration Damian Green saying: 'We believe the research shows that 
the changes introduced up to the start of last year were having, and 
continue to have, an extremely beneficial effect.'
