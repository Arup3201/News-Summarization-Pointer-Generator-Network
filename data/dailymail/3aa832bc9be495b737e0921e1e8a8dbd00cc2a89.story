The second black fox to ever be spotted in Britain has died today, just days after it was spotted by an amateur photographer.

The rare creature was killed after it was hit by a car on a busy road in Bassingbourn, Cambridgeshire, near to where it was first seen by John Moore, 58, on Monday.

Members of the public stopped to see if they could help to save the injured animal after they recognised it from being in the papers, but it was already dead.

According to legend, the black fox is an omen of bad luck, but on this occasion it seems it was the animal whose luck ran out.

Untimely end: The rare black fox lays dead after it was knocked down by a car on a busy road in Bassingbourn, Cambridgeshire

Killed: The black fox, with its distinctive white-tipped tail, runs through a field close to the village

Bad omen? The accident happened on a busy road in Bassingbourn just four days after the fox was first spotted

Unusual: The black fox is so rare - with the colouring caused by a defect gene - that there are only a handful of the breed left in the country

'It’s really sad that it has happened, especially as it so rare,' said Mr Moore, from Bassingbourn.

'I’m so pleased I saw it when I did and got the pictures when I did.

'Now I have seen the fox close up there is no doubt it was a black fox and it was a female.

'I think I may have seen a second 
black fox but I’m not sure if it was a cub or the male. I’m hoping it 
wasn’t a cub as I’m not sure it would survive if the mother is dead.'

Lucky: John Moore from Bassingbourne in Cambridgeshire

Gary Sanderson, communications 
manager at the East of England Ambulance Service, said he was flagged 
down by motorists who had stopped to help the fox.

'After they flagged me down it was evident there was nothing anyone could do and the fox had sadly died.

'I must admit this was the first time I have seen a black fox and it’s a shame it has died.'

The accident happened between 9am and 10am this morning on the Old North Road between Royston and Bassingbourn in Hertfordshire.

According to legend, a black fox brings doom and disaster to anyone who sees it.

Mr Moore first saw the creature, with its distinctive white-tipped tail, in fields behind his house on Monday.

'I’ve heard black foxes are mythical creatures because they supposedly don’t exist,' he said at the time.

'My neighbour thought it was a stray 
dog but I looked through my binoculars and realised it was definitely a 
fox, especially because of its white-tipped tail.

'I didn’t realise how rare it was 
until I did some research. An RSPCA officer told my neighbour the 
organisation had never seen one before as they are that rare.

'In Gaelic tradition, black foxes are
bringers of bad luck and rural communities used to tell of a fox as 
"black as night, so that it could live in a man" shadow and never be 
seen.'

Unwelcome sight: In medieval times, the black fox was considered a bad omen by superstitious villagers

Colouring: The black fox is in fact an ordinary red fox which has black fur or is going through a phase where the colour of its fur is particularly dark

In Gaelic tradition, black foxes are 
bringers of bad luck.

Rural communities used to tell of a fox as 
'black as night, so that it could live in a man's shadow and never be 
seen.'

Centuries-old superstitions are often found attached to black animals, such as black dogs and black cats.

It is thought to originate from when the black dog was said to bring disaster and doom to whoever saw the animal.

In Medieval times, villages were very afraid of the sighting of a black fox and considered it to predict trouble or bad luck.

The black fox is in fact an ordinary 
red fox which has black fur or is going through a phase where the colour
of its fur is particularly dark.

The phenomenon is normally seen in growing cubs and generally the fox will develop to have a dark chestnut coat.

But a few red foxes will remain black
due to a rare genetic flaw dating back hundreds of years. Only a 
handful of them are thought to exist in Britain.

In North America, foxes with black coats are often found with a variable amount of white or white-banded hair in the dark coat.

Centuries-old superstitions are often found attached to black animals, such as black dogs and black cats.

The red fox was introduced to America
by the peans and black foxes exist in much greater numbers there 
because they were not hunted as widely.

In the UK their pelts were highly prized in the fur trade and it is believed the genetic strain became much scarcer.

Only one other black fox has been spotted in Britain before in Preston, Lancashire in 2008.
