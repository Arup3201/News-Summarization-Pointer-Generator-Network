More than 1.2million jobs have been created in the private sector under the Coalition.

While the number of state workers has dropped by 614,000 since May 2010, the number in the private sector has jumped by 1.25million to a record 24.1million, the Office for National Statistics revealed.

It makes a mockery of the claim by Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls in October 2011 that it was ‘a complete fantasy’ the private sector could mop up the jobs culled in the public sector.

At current rates, two private-sector jobs are being created for every one lost in the public sector.

Employment Minister Mark Hoban said: ‘It is a credit to the growth of British businesses up and down the country that we now have a record number of people employed in the private sector.’

The Government was ‘not complacent’ about a jobs market whose strength had consistently surprised economists as Britain’s weak economic recovery dragged on, he said.

Despite a double-dip recession followed by a painfully slow recovery, their predictions that unemployment would rocket, possibly hitting three million, have been wide of the mark.

Tory chairman Grant Shapps also praised the sharp rise in private- sector employment – up 46,000 between January and March while the public sector dropped by 22,000 – as ‘a credit to British businesses’.

‘Our priority now is to carry on getting more people into work, and to help everyone who wants to work hard and get on in life,’ he said.

There is evidence that private- sector bosses have been freezing or cutting staff wages to save money instead making people redundant.

Many workers are happy to accept a pay cut because they are so desperate to hold on to their job, the Institute for Fiscal Studies claimed yesterday.

Rise: In the last two decades the number of over-65s in work has risen sharply from around 430,000 to more than 1million today

Bumpy: The uncertain recovery continues with a small increase in the unemployment rate to 71.6 per cent, still down on the 73 per cent peak five years ago

Benefits: Dole claimants fell last month but the numbers are still much higher than the levels seen before the financial crash and subsequent recession

‘They attach more weight to staying in work (because their expected time to find another job is longer than in the past) than on securing higher wages,’ it said.

The ONS said the average worker was getting a pay rise, if bonuses are excluded, of 0.9 per cent – far below inflation, currently 2.4 per cent.

John Salt, a director of the website Totaljobs.com, said: ‘Businesses who have been treading water during the last three to four years of stagnant GDP figures can no longer afford to put off hiring and must capitalise on these signs of economic growth.’

The number of private sector jobs has risen sharply since a low of 22.5million after the 2008 financial crash

Spending cuts and a renewed focus on creating private sector jobs has seen the number of people working for the state tumble from 6.3million to 5.7million
