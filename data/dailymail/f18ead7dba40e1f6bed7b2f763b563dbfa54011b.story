After a near-fatal cycling accident, the NHS swung into action to save Alex Kerr – with surgery on her pelvis, jaw, knees and her wrist.

But when it came to the final procedure, having her six front teeth replaced, the 20-year-old  was stunned to be told she might have to foot the bill because getting her smile back would count as a cosmetic procedure.

The advertising assistant was left in a coma for a week after being hit by a car when she was cycling back from work in November last year.

Alex Kerr, 20, from Milton Keynes lost six of her teeth in a cycling accident, before and after images are shown left to right.  Northampton General Hospital told Miss Kerr her teeth were not restored because the procedure isn't regarded as 'acute care' and she is waiting to see if payment for the £12,000 treatment will be approved

Doctors managed to save her life and 
she made a full recovery from a broken pelvis, a snapped jaw, two 
dislocated knees and a broken wrist – but was sent home with six of her 
teeth still missing.

She
 is now facing an anxious wait to see if the NHS will approve  payment 
for the treatment – and claims the only way to get it sooner would be to
 fork out £12,000 of her own money.

She
 said: ‘I read in magazines all the time about people who have boob 
jobs, nose jobs and other cosmetic surgery on the NHS because their 
confidence needs boosting.

‘Yet nobody seems to understand how awful it is to have no front teeth at my age.

‘I
 didn’t mean this to happen and I didn’t just go to the doctor and say I
 had a lack of self-confidence and so needed some teeth.

‘I had been in an accident and you would think it would be a priority for them to help me.’

A private dentist has offered to perform the procedure for free, if Miss Kerr, pictured here with her friend Louise Cafey, will pay for the materials. Miss Kerr said she had been initially led to believe her treatment would be carried out for free, but was told it wouldn't be at a follow-up appointment

Miss
 Kerr had been led to believe her treatment would be carried out for 
free when she was transferred to Northampton General Hospital two weeks 
after her accident.

Miss Kerr, pictured, who previously wore braces to perfect her smile, claims the news has left her heartbroken

But
 when she went for a follow-up appointment with a maxillofacial expert 
she was told that she could have to foot the bill for future treatment 
herself.

With permanent
 implants costing around £2,000 per tooth, she  said she began to wonder
 whether her smile would ever get back  to normal.

Miss
 Kerr, from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, has now been offered a 
discounted rate by a local dentist – but would still have to come up 
with the money for the materials herself.

She
 said the loss of her teeth had left her devastated, adding: ‘I had 
braces for two years and when they came off they made my teeth really 
white.

‘Everyone used to love my teeth, but the braces seem like a bit of a waste now.

‘I don’t want to be keeping my teeth in a glass next to the sink when I’m only 20.’

A
 spokesman for Northampton General Hospital confirmed that replacing 
Miss Kerr’s teeth was ‘not classified as acute care’ – and that patients
 were therefore normally advised to consult their dentist.

However
 he went on to  say that she was still on the waiting list for a 
surgical appointment at the hospital to discuss future  dental 
treatment.

A spokesman for Northampton General Hospital, pictured, said patients are normally advised to consult their dentist, yet added Miss Kerr has an appointment to discuss her teeth: 'Unfortunately there is a waiting list,' said the spokesman, 'but we can assure Alex she has not been abandoned by the NHS'

He added: 
‘We saw Alex in our maxillofacial department in January and referred her
 to our consultant in surgery to assess what can be done for her in the 
long term from a restorative perspective.

‘Unfortunately
 there is a waiting list for these appointments but we can assure Alex 
that the wheels are in motion and that she has not been abandoned by the
 NHS.’
