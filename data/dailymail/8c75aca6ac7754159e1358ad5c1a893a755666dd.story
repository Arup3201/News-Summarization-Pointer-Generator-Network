Travellers  who fought to stop new caravans moving onto their site because it would be too crowded have lost their 'not in my back yard' battle.

Councillors voted unanimously to add the new pitches near Port Talbot, south Wales - saying they have housing targets and travellers should be treated like everyone else.

A handful of residents on the Caegarw Gipsy and Traveller Site formed an angry petition last year after  council chiefs won funds from the Welsh Government to expand their camp.

Not in our back yard: Residents of this traveller site near Port Talbot, south Wales, wanted to block plans to add 11 caravan pitches to their camp - but they were overruled unanimously by local councillors

The plans included 11 new caravan pitches, two new play areas and toilet blocks along the length of a new road.

One resident told MailOnline at the time: 'Most people here are happy with the way things are and don't want this changed.

'This site is already overcrowded and expanding it will only attract more people, it's like an advertisement.

'If it goes ahead people will be heading for Port Talbot and setting up in the first car park they come to. That's what I'll be doing.

'We have lived here since it opened 30 years ago, a lot of people have, but this will drive them back to their old way of life.

Expansion: The plans will add 11 pitches, toilet blocks and two play areas to the 2.5-acre rural site

'If this expansion happens there will be overcrowding at local schools and at the doctors. It's disgraceful.

'The council would be better off saving its money. We are happy with things the way they are.'

Labour councillor Rob Jones, who was approached by the residents, said 'ten to 12' residents had signed a petition which was handed to Neath Port Talbot council.

But none wrote formal letters of complaint or turned up to the planning committee meeting which ruled in favour on Tuesday.

There councillors decided unanimously to expand the rural 2.5-acre site near the village of Pyle despite the travellers' complaints.

Mr Jones told MailOnline: 'I think it's going to enhance the site and at the end of the day we're catering for the gipsy and traveller community.

'When it comes to brick and mortar houses we have to deliver 6,500 to 7,000 in the next few years.

'The gipsy community is being treated no differently to any other section of the community.

'I welcome the planning committee's decision.' 

Previously Mr Jones had confirmed he was approached by angry residents.

'They don't want an expansion on the site,' he said. 'They started a petition within their community to prevent the council from going ahead.

'If you live in a lovely, countryside area, in a close-knit community, would you want strangers coming in?' 

Families at the Cae Garw camp previously said there was a divide over the council plans between those who had been there for decades and newcomers.

Jeffrey Jones, a long term resident at the site, said: 'It's not a question of the people, it's the space.

'How would these councillors suddenly like a lot of houses built opposite where they live? Nobody wants that.'

Rural location: The site is on the edge of the south Wales village of Pyle. Jeffrey Jones, a long term resident of the site, said previously: 'It's not a question of the people, it's the space... Nobody wants that'

But mother-of-seven Lucy Price, 30, originally from Ireland, welcomed the expansion plans.

She said: 'I know some people here are against this but they tend to be the older generation.

'People here with families support the expansion. The children would like to see a park built as well.

'I think more people should be able to come here if they want. There are more people for this than against.'

Gareth Nutt, director of environment at Neath Port Talbot Council, said there was a need for additional pitches up to 2026. 

Councillor Suzanne Paddison said: 'It is pleasing to see that our council is providing adequate spaces for these communities.'
