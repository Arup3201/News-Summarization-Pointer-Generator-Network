A jobless mother-of-four who starred in a BBC Panorama documentary about life on a 'Shameless'-style council estate claims the Corporation made her look worse than she really is.

Olwen Page, 44, sparked outrage amongst millions of viewers after being filmed saying: 'I’ve got better things to do than go jogging down here looking for a job', whilst pocketing up to £1,100 a month in benefit handouts.

The show entitled ‘Trouble on the Estate’ was screened last night on BBC1 and portrayed life on Shadsworth Estate in Blackburn, Lancashire, as miserable.

Adamant: Mrs Page, 44, who has lived in and around the Shadsworth Estate in Blackburn, Lancashire for 20 years, said the BBC edited out the fact she could not work because she was 'on the sick'

It described the estate as 'one of the most deprived places in 
the country' and noted that 'on average, per person, had one of the 
highest welfare bills in the country'.

Mrs Page, other estate residents and local 
councillors have now hit back at the BBC saying the Panorama 
investigation had contrived to liken Shadsworth Estate to Channel 4's 
drama Shameless.

Mrs Page, a former teaching 
assistant, who has four children by three different fathers, was filmed 
explaining why she had not worked for eight years and admitting smoking 
cannabis at home to 'chill out'.

When her local job centre asked her to attend a meeting about her continuing unemployment she declared she was 'p****d off' at having to get a bus into town and appeared to express relief when she returned home still jobless on the show.

She also blamed the authorities for one of her children being excluded from school and was given two skips, free paint and wallpaper to clean and spruce up her home.

The show also claimed Mrs Page was given 'parental skills' by social workers, which included how to put her son to bed. Her daughter’s unruly behaviour was said to be so bad that council officials threatened the family with eviction.

After the programme, viewers claimed she 'made their blood boil' and branded her a 'moaning minnie' for complaining about her life on the Shadsworth Estate in Blackburn, Lancashire.

But today Mrs Page who has lived in and around the estate for 20 years said: 'I’m not happy about the "can’t be a***d jogging to the Job Centre" because they didn’t explain why I couldn’t work.

'The fact is I have been put on the sick because I’m struggling physically because of depression. The programme was edited in a way that didn’t show that.

'They didn’t put that I have been through domestic violence and I have low self esteem and when I go to the Job Centre they make me feel low and dirty and it’s degrading.

Mrs Page added: 'I haven’t put my Facebook on yet, I don’t think I can face it but anybody who knows me knows that I tell it how it is and I don’t give a flying f**k what people think.'

Residents insist the Panorama show was one-sided and purposely focused on the 
negatives. Some accused the broadcaster of encouraging local youths 
to look more menacing than they actually are.

Councillor
Jim Shorrock said: ‘As someone who has lived in Shadsworth for the past
fourteen years, I am horrified. They chose Shadsworth as an easy 
target.

‘Constituents tell 
me of young lads being asked to pull their hoods up “for effect”, and 
working people being edited out simply because they work. I despair if 
this is true.’

He added he was worried that the BBC had simply tried to make Shadsworth appear like Channel 4’s sink estate drama Shameless.

Mr
Shorrock explained: ‘I sincerely hope this doesn’t look like an episode
of Shameless, because it could set my ward back twenty years.’

Speaking to local papers, Mary 
Anderson and Alison Critchley, from the Shadsworth Tenants’ and 
Residents’ Association, said they had been 'misled' by programme makers 
and regretted agreeing to take part.

She
said: ‘They have scandalised our home. The film makers asked me for 
help. I was concerned but they promised they would highlight the 
positives and give a fair picture. When I saw the title I felt I had 
been misled and the estate was being misrepresented.

‘There
are lots of good things in Shadsworth, investment and many good people.
We run many clubs and events at the community centre - jobs clubs, 
breakfast clubs for older people, support for those with mental, drug 
and alcohol problems.’

Mrs 
Critchley insisted that while the area was deprived, the crime rate had 
fallen for three consecutive years and feared the Panorama programme 
could impact house prices, local investment and community morale.

Today Blackburn MP Jack Straw vowed 
to complain to BBC governors about the programme claiming it portrayed 
Shadsworth as if it was 'an uncharted part of Africa'.

He said: 'I shall be writing a strongly-worded complaint to the BBC Trust about this film. It is unacceptable to send a reporter from London who then treats Shadsworth like a Victorian explorer in an uncharted part of Africa.

'The estate does have problems, but so do many others everywhere else in Britain. They viewed Shadsworth through the eyes of a handful of well-known dysfunctional families and implied everybody on the estate shares that outlook.

'The few positives mentioned were simply fig-leaves. The film badly misrepresented the lifestyles of the great majority on the estate, and sought to sensationalise its problems.

'I have spent 33 years as its MP, and know the area extremely well. It went through serious problems in the 80s and early 90s - just as many similar areas did when much of manufacturing collapsed.

'But the area has improved significantly since then. As for "drugs, anti-social behaviour, family break-ups, and joblessness" - such circumstances are not confined to classic estates.

'But these days there is overall much better social behaviour, and significantly less crime.'

A Panorama spokesman said: 'It is categorically untrue that the programme team sought to influence the behaviour of anyone they filmed, and certainly didn’t ask them to put up hoods, as is evident from the youngsters featured in the film.

'We didn’t edit out anybody on the basis that they worked. Indeed, working people are featured in the film.'

Regarding the comments made by Mrs Page, the spokesman said: 'The programme quoted Olwen explaining why she can't work because of illness and the programme made clear that she has suffered domestic violence.

'When she spoke to the programme makers this morning she said that she was happy with it and her contribution to it.'

In response to the comments made by Mr Straw: 'We stand by the programme as a fair and balanced portrayal of life on the estate.

'All of the main contributors to the programme have said that they are both happy with it and their contribution to it.

'Indeed the programme makers have been thanked by some residents. We spent many months on the estate and reflected both what we were told and what we filmed, including the view of the police.

'However, the many residents we spoke to told us that anti-social behaviour and drugs are a real problem there. Whilst the programme makers are happy to defend their journalism, they believe that the criticism it is currently receiving deflects attention from the issues which are of genuine concern to many residents on the estate and the wider public.'
