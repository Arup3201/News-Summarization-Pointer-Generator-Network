More than 650,000 passengers pass through Penn Station every day, making it by far the busiest in the U.S.

So when one Amtrak train bound for Washington pulled away from the station on Saturday at 3pm, it was somewhat of a surprise that it managed to forget all of its passengers.

The Acela Express 2253 departed as passengers were waiting at a completely different platform after being given the wrong information. The driver apparently left without getting permission from the station.

When they realised what had happened, passengers took to Twitter to vent their frustration.

‘You don’t see railroads lose trains very often but @Amtrak has lost their Acela Express at Pennsylvania Station New York,’ wrote Ira Socol.

Another, Michael Yu, wrote: ‘Thanks @Amtrak, missing a wedding cause Acela 2253 left NYC without boarding any passengers.’

Keli Goff wrote: 'This has got to be a first. The @Amtrak #acela FORGOT to pick up ANY passengers for the 3pm departing NYC. BRAVO @amtrak #greatcustomersvc.'

She followed that up with: 'Well @amtrak offered free pizza so there's that. As one guy said "I'd prefer a working train."'

Damien Miano, 60, from Chelsea, told the New York Daily News: ‘They literally sent us to the wrong platform, and the conductor took off without any passengers.

‘The right hand didn’t know what the left hand was doing. It was just so bizarre.’

He added that when the passengers returned to the main level of the station, they were met by an Amtrak manager who explained the situation and then handed out bags of Doritos. They were also fed pizza.

Eventually, the majority of passengers jumped on to a train more than two hours later.

Kimerly Woods, a spokesman for Amtrak, told the Daily News: ‘We’re investigating why the train left the station before all passengers could board.’

As of Monday, there was no further explanation on Amtrak’s Twitter account, even though passengers were asking for a refund.
