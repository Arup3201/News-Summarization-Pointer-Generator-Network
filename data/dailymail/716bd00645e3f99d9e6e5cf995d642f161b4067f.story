Nigeria's president has made a surprise visit to the heartland of the Boko Haram movement to meet survivors of the massacre which saw an estimated 2,500 people slaughtered by Islamist militants.

Goodluck Jonathan spent three hours in Maidugri, capital of Borno State, and addressed 5,000 people who have been sheltering in a camp since the attack by the terror group earlier this month.

The president's visit comes just a day after new images obtained by Amnesty International show the devastation of the assault - with more than 3,700 structures including houses and schools completely destroyed in the towns of Baga and Doron Baga.

President Goodluck Jonathan, dressed in a grey shirt and dark hat, meets survivors of the Boko Haram massacre in Nigeria, which is thought to have killed 2,500 people 

The president addressed the crowd and told them that all areas of Nigeria under the control of Boko Haram would be recaptured soon 

Around 5,000 people are currently living in a camp after their towns were completely destroyed in the deadly attack 

One witness of the attack described how the ruthless terror group were shooting indiscriminately, killing even small children and a woman who was in labour.

During his visit to the camp, Mr Jonathan promised that all areas of Nigeria under the control of Boko Haram would be recaptured soon.

He told the crowd of displaced people: 'I want to assure you that you will soon go back to your houses.'

The president's visit to Maiduguri - his first since March 2013 - was shrouded in secrecy and came after a previous trip to the region in May last year was cancelled at the last minute.

Nigeria's leader has come under fierce criticism for his failure to crush Boko Haram's bid to establish a hardline Islamic state in northeast Nigeria.

His visit comes after aerial shots emerged yesterday of the towns taken a day before the attack and a day after, showing the massive scale of destruction after the massacre. 

They were released by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, who said the images suggested 'devastation of catastrophic proportions'.

They added that 11 per cent of Baga and 57 percent of Doron Baga was flattened, most likely by fire.

Human Rights Watch said the exact death toll was unknown and quoted one local resident as saying: 'No one stayed back to count the bodies.

People were forced to queue up to take refuge inside a 'Teachers Village' in Maiduguri after their homes were destroyed in the Boko Haram attack 

Children play on the ground outside the refuge. More than 3,700 structures including houses and schools were completely destroyed in the towns of Baga and Doron Baga

'We were all running to get out of town ahead of Boko Haram fighters who have since taken over the area.'

Meanwhile Amnesty cited reports of women being rounded up and detained at a school.

They added: 'The deliberate killing of civilians and destruction of their property by Boko Haram are war crimes and crimes against humanity and must be duly investigated.'

It comes as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry accused the Islamist insurgents of a 'crime against humanity'.

He described Boko Haram as a 'serious threat to all of our values' during a visit to Bulgaria with British foreign secretary Philip Hammond.

Cameroon also announced that neighbouring Chad will send troops to aid their country's fight against Boko Haram, though no date for the deployment or size of the contingent was given. 

Meanwhile Gordon Brown, UN special envoy for education, urged the world to condemn the use of young girls as suicide bombers by Boko Haram, calling it 'barbaric.'  

At least 19 people were killed on Saturday when a young girl, thought to be aged about 10, blew herself up at a crowded market in the northeast Nigerian city of Maiduguri, the Red Cross and local vigilantes said.

Boko Haram also drew international condemnation when its fighters kidnapped 276 schoolgirls from a boarding school in north-east Chibok last year. Dozens escaped, but 219 remain missing.
