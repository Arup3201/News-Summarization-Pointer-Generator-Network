A father got a nasty  shock when he tried to unplug his little girl’s iPad charger – only for it to explode in his hand.

Tim Gillooley, 34, was thrown across the room and suffered burns to his fingers when he removed the plug from the wall socket. He said the electric shock would have killed his daughter Chloe, eight.

The incident took place at Mr Gillooley’s mother’s house.

Shock: Tim Gillooley and his daughter, Chloe, 8, with the Apple iPad and charger, which exploded as he unplugged it giving him a massive electric shock

‘There was a massive bang and I felt a huge jolt up my arm, and I was thrown completely across the room,’ he said.

‘I was in total shock. Chloe burst into tears and everyone was stunned.

‘This
 has very serious safety implications. I am pretty angry because nine 
times out of ten, Chloe would have gone to get it herself.

‘I
 think it would definitely have killed her. The shock I received was 
massive.’ Mr Gillooley, from Warrington, bought Chloe the iPad Mini for 
her birthday last November from the Apple Store in Liverpool.

Some
 months later it began to develop problems while charging, and he 
returned to the shop – but was told there was nothing wrong with the 
charger or the device.

Frazzled: The remains of the iPad charger which Mr Gooley said had exploded in his hand

Instead he purchased a new cable in the hope it would solve the charging problems – but saw no improvement.

The
 former trader, who is now a full-time carer for his mother, said: ‘We 
were big fans of Apple, but I won’t let my daughter near her iPhone now 
because it could be a ticking timebomb.’

Apple
 is yet to comment on Mr Gillooley’s claims. It has asked him to send it
 the iPad and remains of the charger for examination.

Mr
 Gillooley, who has split custody of Chloe, said he is particularly 
upset by the incident because he used the gadgets to keep in contact 
with his daughter when she stays with her mother.

The
 incident follows reports that a  23-year-old Chinese air stewardess, Ma
 Ailun, was killed by an electric shock when she answered a call on her 
iPhone 5 while it was charging.

The tale prompted a wave of criticism of Apple among China’s millions of iPhone users.

The victim’s sister said: ‘I want to warn everyone else not to make phone calls when your mobile phone is recharging.’

Miss
 Ma, who was due to marry this month, was said to have bought her iPhone
 in December from an  official store in her home town in Xinjiang 
province.

Her brother said 
the phone had been handed to the Chinese authorities for examination, 
while Apple said it had launched a full investigation into the claims.

In
 another incident earlier this year, New York marketing manager Shibani 
Bhujle claimed the battery of her iPhone 4S spontaneously melted, oozing
 acid that destroyed the handset. In January, firemen in Oregon blamed a
 fire in a block of flats on an overheated battery for an Apple MacBook 
laptop, which had dropped on to a mattress.

In
 November 2011, Apple recalled its iPod Nano music players amid fears 
that the batteries in older  models were prone to overheating and 
catching fire.
