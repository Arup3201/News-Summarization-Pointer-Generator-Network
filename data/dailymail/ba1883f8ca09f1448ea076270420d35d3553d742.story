Lewis Hamilton decided that the voice of his boss in his ear was not worth following. Team orders? No, thank you, I have a world championship to win.

It was the British driver’s defiance in the face of an instruction to let through Nico Rosberg, his Mercedes team-mate and only rival for the title, that dominated talk here in the paddock long after Daniel Ricciardo’s win in a topsy-turvy Hungarian Grand Prix of sliding and safety cars had parked up for the night.

The order came three-quarters of the way into the race during the eight laps in which Rosberg, who was on a different strategy, was about a second behind Hamilton. Hamilton refused to yield. Rosberg, who was informed that the team had decided Hamilton should give way, twice asked why his team-mate had not done so.

Twice more Hamilton was asked to allow Rosberg in front. Again and again he disobliged the pit wall.It was an act of regrettable insubordination, one that took the gloss off a wonderful recovery drive that took Hamilton, whose car burst into flames in qualifying, from a pit-lane start to a third-place finish.

He
 was putting his own needs above those of the team. He may even have 
denied them victory, through Rosberg. That was the view of Mercedes 
director Toto Wolff, who said: ‘If Lewis had let Nico go, Nico could 
have won the race.’ Instead he finished fourth.

Hamilton
 sadly failed to emulate Rosberg’s good behaviour towards him in two 
races last season when he respectively held position and gave way in the
 Malaysian and German grands prix. Admittedly, there was less at stake 
then.

Given that team orders are permitted in the rules, they should be followed. Otherwise, why have them?

That is the case against Hamilton. And it is unarguable – to some degree.

Hamilton,
 however, could cite mitigation. Rosberg was never exactly on his 
gearbox, and it would have taken a big gulp to hand over his place.

As
 Hamilton argued afterwards, he was in ‘the same race’ as Rosberg, the 
man who led him by 14 points at the start of the afternoon but only 11 
at the end.

Hamilton added that he was 'very, very shocked’ by the 
instruction, while Rosberg, who is an even-keeled non-controversialist, 
said he would not comment publicly on the situation until he had 
discussed the matter with the team.

Hamilton was supported by the 
ever-loyal Niki Lauda, the executive chairman of Mercedes, who said: ‘I 
feel it is a racer and I would have done exactly the same thing. He did 
nothing wrong. He was just defending his position.

‘Nico was too far 
away. Paddy (Lowe, the technical director who relayed the instruction to
 Hamilton via his race engineer Peter Bonnington) saw this and he 
stopped telling the engineers to slow Lewis down. He told them just to 
race.’

The team were doing their best to protect Hamilton – as they 
always do – and smooth over the searching questions the controversy 
prompted. Can anyone control Hamilton? Seemingly not given that Wolff 
said there would be ‘no ramifications’ for this act of disobedience.

‘I don’t want to play the vicious general and demand that they obey the rules,’ said Wolff, somewhat benevolently.

‘Paddy or I could have gone on the radio, but we didn’t.’

That means Lewis can blithely do as he pleases.

It
 is at crisis moments such as these that the calming, experienced 
presence of Ross Brawn, the super strategist who left Mercedes last 
season, is missed. Would Hamilton have defied him over the radio? Less 
chance.

Wolff said at the start of the season that he was confident 
the word of Lowe and himself would be writ. It was embarrassingly 
exposed not to be so by this incident.

Wolff, admitting he was now in
 corporate mode, tried to defuse the situation, saying: ‘That was such a
 difficult race with so many difficult decisions that needed to be made,
 quick decisions. We need to analyse how we ended up there and whether 
from here we need to discuss the racing between the two.

‘It is 
getting intense and it is clear that they are direct competitors for the
 world championship. We need to sit down and discuss it.

At the start
 of the season the team drew up a long list detailing how they and each 
driver would respond in any given situation, but that is no longer 
relevant given the developing dynamics of the championship: a deep 
internal duel among the drivers and a constructors' championship 
practically won.

‘Maybe that (blueprint) doesn’t function anymore,’ 
said Wolff. ‘We cannot ask either driver to give up positions or 
jeopardise their own championship chances for the benefit of the team.’

Away
 from this dispute, there was a fantastic race. Not least by Hamilton, 
who scythed his way up the field. ‘Once the green light came I was just 
in hunting mode,’ he said.

He made a particularly daring move stick, 
passing Jean-Eric Vergne’s Toro Rosso on the outside of a left-handed 
turn. Fabulous.

Shunt: Marcus Ericsson ended up in the barriers after losing control of his Caterham on the exit of Turn 3

Before the wet conditions dried out, the safety car was out twice, which helped Hamilton as the field concertinaed.

Congratulations to Ricciardo, who put his Red Bull past Fernando Alonso’s Ferrari in the dying moments of the race.

At this stage Rosberg was close on Hamilton’s heels. Again. He asked no quarter and he was given none.

Lap 1: Hamilton passes Kevin Magnussen as they leave the pits, but he spins moments later at Turn 2. He nudges the barrier but survives without any damage to his Mercedes and re-joins the race.Lap 4: Hamilton overtakes Marcus Ericsson and then the McLaren of Magnussen to move up to 19th.Lap 5: He then passes Pastor Maldonado, Max Chilton and Kamui Kobayashi on one lap to be 16th.Lap 7: It’s Jules Bianchi up next, and the Briton dispatches of the Marussia driver with ease.Lap 8: Hamilton then sails past the Ferrari of Kimi Raikkonen on the pit straight for 13th having already overtaken Romain Grosjean.Lap 14: Four places gained for Hamilton after the safety car period sees the Briton move up to 9th.Lap 17: Three laps later, and the charging Mercedes driver is up to 7th.Lap 25: Hamilton is now fifth after Daniel Ricciardo and Felipe Massa pit.Lap 34: It’s 2nd for Hamilton after a sumptuous move on Jean-Eric Vergne, Nico Rosberg’s pit-stop and Vettel’s wild spin.Lap 39: Hamilton incredibly leads the race following Fernando Alonso’s pit stop.Lap 40: The Briton then comes in for a change of tyres, but a sluggish pit stop sees him re-join in 5th.Lap 51: Hamilton ignores a team instruction to let Rosberg, on a different strategy to the Briton, through.Lap 55: Hamilton is back up to 2nd after Ricciardo, Kimi Raikkonen and Felipe Massa pit.Lap 67: Ricciardo passes Hamilton with three laps remaining and he holds on to the final podium spot despite a late onslaught from title rival Rosberg.
