Barack Obama last night threw David Cameron a political lifeline by following his lead in giving US politicians the chance to veto air strikes on Syria.

In an unprecedented move, the President said he was determined to bomb Syria – but not until Congress voted on the matter.

In theory, as Commander-in-Chief of US forces, he could ignore any Congress vote against military action, but having invited them to do so it is considered highly unlikely.

President Obama has declared the US should take military action against Bashar Al-Assad's regime

Speaking at the White House rose garden, President Obama said he would seek congressional backing for any intervention

The Syrian army restarted its barrage 
on the rebel-held suburbs of Damascus just two minutes after President 
Obama finished his speech threatening air strikes. The attacks had 
stopped five hours earlier.

Regime forces also immediately ‘intensified’ attacks on Aleppo in Northern Syria.

But on the streets of Damascus, those opposing Assad reacted with fury and disbelief that US intervention was not imminent.

‘What did we go through all that for?’ asked one woman. ‘Assad is victorious.’

Speaking
 from the White House Rose Garden, Mr Obama referred directly to Mr 
Cameron’s decision to allow MPs to vote on the issue and again referred 
to Britain as America’s ‘closest ally’.

Mr
 Cameron’s gamble backfired when Labour leader Ed Miliband, backed by 
Tory and Lib Dem rebels, inflicted a shock defeat, keeping Britain out 
of the conflict.

Tory MPs 
feared the vote had inflicting a devastating blow to Mr Cameron’s 
standing at home and abroad – and to the Anglo-US ‘special 
relationship.’

But Mr 
Obama’s extraordinary decision to emulate Mr Cameron, immediately hailed
 by the Prime Minister’s supporters as ‘a huge compliment’, could turn 
the tables on Mr Miliband, who believed he had scored a notable success.

Within
 minutes of Mr Obama’s statement, a relieved Mr Cameron tweeted: ‘I 
understand and support Barack Obama’s position on #Syria.’

And Foreign Secretary William Hague tweeted: ‘A fine speech by the President of the United States on #Syria.’

The extraordinary development from Washington came at the end of Mr Cameron’s worst week in No 10 since winning power in 2010.

The
 Prime Minister was widely criticised for misjudging his plan to support
 US plans to punish the Syrian regime after the massacre of hundreds of 
civilians near Damascus. According to US intelligence reports, 1,429 
people were killed by chemical weapons on August 21, including hundreds 
of children.

The Prime Minister quickly took to Twitter to endorse the president's approach

Mr Obama’s 
warm praise for Britain came only 24 hours after the White House had 
called France, which has backed the military action, as its ‘oldest 
ally’. In one sentence, Mr Obama appears to have restored the old order.

Mr
 Obama’s comments about the need for a democratic vote on strikes 
against Syria echoed almost word-for-word Mr Cameron’s  justification 
for asking MPs to support him.

Flanked
 by Vice-President Joe Biden, the President said that he remained 
convinced military action against Assad was needed and that there was no
 need to wait for the  UN weapons inspectors to report on the massacre.

Then
 he explained why he was taking the same democratic course as Mr 
Cameron: ‘Many people have advised against taking this decision to 
Congress and undoubtedly they were impacted by what we saw happen in the
 United Kingdom this week when the Parliament of our closest ally failed
 to pass a resolution with a similar goal, even as the Prime Minister 
supported taking action.

'Yet,
 while I believe I have the authority to carry out this action without 
specific congressional authorisation I know that the country will be 
stronger if we take this course and our actions will be even more 
effective.’

A source close to Mr Cameron said: ‘We are delighted the president has done this. It vindicates the Prime Minister completely.’

President Obama revealed advisers had cautioned against going to Congress, particularly in light of the Commons defeat David Cameron suffered

Mr
 Obama said:  ‘We saw terrible images of the dead. All told 1,000 people
 were murdered including several hundred children. Young boys and girls 
were gassed to death by their own government. This was an assault on 
human dignity and a serious danger to security.’

Mr
 Obama assured the US public: ‘We will not put boots on the ground’ but 
said the US was ‘prepared to strike whenever we choose’.

He
 added, ‘I know well that we are weary of war. That is why we’re not 
contemplating putting our troops in the middle [of a civil war]. But we 
cannot and must not turn a blind eye to actions in Damascus.’

However
 Vladimir Putin yesterday dismissed claims that Syria used chemical 
weapons as ‘nonsense’ and challenged the United States to provide proof 
before launching air strikes.

The
 Russian President insisted that if Washington had evidence Bashar 
Assad’s forces ‘used weapons of mass destruction’ it should be presented
 to the United Nations.

But 
Mr Putin said: ‘If they say that the [Syrian] governmental forces used 
weapons of mass destruction… and that they have proof of it, let them 
present it to the UN inspectors and the UN security council.

‘Claims that the proof exists, but is classified and cannot be presented to anybody, are below criticism.’

There was no immediate response to Mr Putin’s intervention from the White House.

President Obama said he was 'comfortable going forward without the approval of a United Nations Security Council' that had so far been 'unwilling to hold Assad accountable'

The
 President faces an uphill battle to get Congressional permission to 
attack Syria. As it stands, the Republican-controlled lower House of 
Representatives will almost certainly deny permission while the 
Democratically-controlled Senate might give him a reluctant go ahead.

Some
 Washington-based analysts said last night that Mr Obama could suffer 
the same humiliation as Mr Cameron – and lose the vote.

His decision to delay military was criticised by Syria’s main opposition party, the Syrian National Coalition.

A
 spokesman said: ‘I am surprised that the President said he has the 
legal authority and the moral responsibility to respond but then to pass
 this on to Congress. 

‘The people of Syria will feel that this is inaction.

‘This is a failure of leadership on the President’s part.

‘I
 thought this announcement was to tell the whole world that he is going 
to punish this brutal regime and let them know they cannot use chemical 
weapons against their own people.’

But
 last night Syria’s prime minister Wael al-Halqi said his country was 
prepared for US military action. He said: ‘The Syrian army is fully 
ready, its finger on the trigger to face any challenge or scenario that 
they want to carry out.’
