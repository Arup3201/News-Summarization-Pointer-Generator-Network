England will break with tradition and present Wayne Rooney with the Golden Cap designed to commemorate his century of appearances before Saturday’s Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia. 

David Beckham, Steven Gerrard, Ashley Cole and Frank Lampard all received the honour ahead of the next Wembley international after they had completed their 100th game. 

Rooney will reach the milestone at Wembley on Saturday and will lead out the team with sons Kai and Klay.

Bobby Moore - 108

Ashley Cole - 107

Sir Bobby Charlton - 106

Frank Lampard - 106

Billy Wright - 105

If he were to follow the usual procedure he would receive his Golden Cap ahead of the qualifier against Lithuania in March but Sir Bobby Charlton  — one of eight other England centurions — will make the presentation before kick-off on Saturday. 

Roy Hodgson believes his captain still has his best years in an England shirt ahead of him as he blends experience with his natural talents. ‘I think he will become better,’ said Hodgson in an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live. 

‘He has had a turbulent career in many ways, bursting on to the scene as the wonderkid and being the saviour of English football. 

'He has had to suffer the slings and arrows because of the times when of course he has not been able to be the saviour of English football and people have criticised him for it.

‘That has given him an incredible maturity and all the qualities he had at 19 he basically still possesses, but what he does have which he didn’t have at 19 or 24 or 25 is this incredible experience, this incredible belief and mental strength. 

‘That is something we will need going forward, mental strength. That’s a harder thing to teach or to instil in the squad than tactics or technique.’ 

At 29, Rooney can target Peter Shilton’s record of 125 England caps, according to his vice captain Gary Cahill. ‘He’s fit, he looks after himself and trains really hard, so I can’t see why not,’ said Cahill. 

‘I can’t see why he can’t break all the records, to be honest. 

‘He’s a world-class player. We’ve seen that over many years. To be coming up to 100 caps at such a young age is phenomenal. He can go on for many, many more years. He’s a fantastic player.’
