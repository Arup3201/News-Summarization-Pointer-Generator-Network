A terminal cancer sufferer has managed to grow rare Japanese bananas in his Devon back garden.

Paul Edis, 54, and his wife Srey-March, 32, planted a Musa basjoo tree - which originates from Japan’s remote Ryukyu Islands - in Plymouth, but it remained dormant for four years.

However, as Britain enjoyed one of its longest, warmest summers and driest Septembers on record, the plant burst into life - shooting up to 15ft tall and producing juicy bananas for the first time.

Achievement: Paul and Srey-March Edis have grown rare Japanese bananas in their garden in Plymouth, Devon

Fruit: Bananas are fruiting in Mr Edis's garden in Devon. He buried the plant on 4ft of decaying autumn leaves

Mr Edis, a decorated Royal Navy veteran, tried twice before to grow banana trees but said they died out in the harsh winters. This time he buried the plant on 4ft of decaying autumn leaves.

But he said the latest growth was thanks to prayer, adding: ‘I was sitting next to my beloved banana tree and said that if the Lord was up there, looking down at me, to give me a sign.

‘Within a week we had our first flower. I think it’s spiritual. The heat from the leaves kept it alive. No one I know has heard of a banana tree being grown in someone’s garden. We get a lot of people coming to see it.’

Mrs Edis, who has two sons with her husband - Deano, four, and Rio, two - now uses the bananas to cook authentic cuisine from her native Cambodia where they are used for both food and medicine.

Mr Edis - a former shopkeeper who sold his business after being diagnosed with cancer of the oesophagus, stomach and liver - added: ‘They lay the leaves on the ground to prepare food on.

Food: Yellow bean cakes which Mr Edis has been making with the banana leaves from his front garden

Success: Mr Edis, 54, tried twice before to grow banana trees but said they died out in the harsh winters

‘They use it for cooking, wrapping food in it. They use the bark for fires, and the plant for medicines, especially upset stomachs. And of course the bananas are a source of food and nutrition.’

Experts at Cornwall’s Eden Project attraction have confirmed the plant is almost certainty a Musa basjoo, also known as a ‘Japanese banana’ or ‘hardy banana’.

It is typically grown in southern China, with vast wild populations found in Sichuan province, and parts of Canada and the US.

Hetty Ninnis, Eden’s rainforest biome team lead, said: ‘It’s a type that is quite hardy. We grow it here at Eden in the outdoor biome.

‘If you can find a nice south-facing sheltered spot, protect from frost and feed them well they can be grown very successfully down this way.

‘This looks like a lovely healthy specimen. The sap is good for treating burns, a bit like aloe vera. Leaves are used in some other traditional medicines.’

Good weather: It comes as experts revealed September was warmer than August across parts of the UK

Mr Edis spent 26 years in the Navy, being awarded five medals for serving in the Falklands, Gulf and Adriatic wars.

His horticultural feat comes as experts revealed September was warmer than August across parts of the UK.

The Central England Temperature of 15.3C was 1.2C above the mean for 1981-2010, making the month - rarely - warmer than August, said weather historian Philip Eden.

It was the warmest September since 2006, and in the last 100 years only three Septembers were warmer, two had the same mean temperature, while 95 were cooler.

Separately, the Met Office said it was set to be the driest September across the UK since records began in 1910, with exceptionally low rainfall for many parts of the country.
