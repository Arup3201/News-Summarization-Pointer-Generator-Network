Predator: Ryan Chambers, 19, had been living in his father's flat on his own and used it as a place to have sex with the girls

A 'very dangerous and predatory' teenager who sexually abused four girls he met on Facebook has been jailed for three years and nine months.

Ryan Chambers amassed the names and phone numbers of more than 1,000 girls aged between 12 and 15 years by making flattering remarks about their profile pictures on the social networking site.

The 19-year-old would bombard the girls with chat up lines in the hope they would 'rise to the bait' before inviting them round to the flat where he lived alone and have consensual sex with them.

He was found guilty of eight counts of sexual activity with a child, involving four girls, after a two-and-a-half week trial and was jailed yesterday.

Judge Ronald Moss heard that the 'manipulative loner' was in brief relationships with some of his victims.

Judge Moss, sitting at Aylesbury Crown Court, said: 'You were in a relationship with one of the victims but not for long because you jumped from pillar to post using Facebook on a frequent manner.

'Despite your young age you are a sexual predator. What you did by using Facebook was hope that somebody would rise to the bait and would be flattered by your comments. You would then chance your arm with them.

'You flattered them, all were young under the age of 16 and somewhat immature. They welcomed you flattery and you were quite practiced in giving it.'

When the girls tried to break free from the controlling relationship, Chambers would guilt trip them into staying with him, the judge said.

Judge Moss added: 'You threatened to burn the house down of one of your victims if they stopped contact with you. And on more than one occasion you threatened to commit suicide yourself.'

Police were alerted to Chambers by the mother of one of his 14-year-old victims who was concerned her daughter was being groomed over the internet.

Officers raided Chambers’ flat in June, last year, and arrested him after finding lists featuring more than 1,000 names and mobile phone numbers.

Chambers had been living in his father’s flat in Akerlea Close, Milton Keynes, Bucks., on his own and used it as a place to have sex with the girls.

While on bail for these offences police found Chambers at the flat with a 14-year-old girl who had been reported missing by her worried parents.

He was remanded in custody and analysis of his Facebook use found he had set up 11 profiles on the site under variations of his name.

They also found four videos on his mobile phone of oral sex with two of the victims.

Judge Moss said: 'These offences were serious, carefully planned and caused a great deal of anxiety, not necessarily for the victims, but for their parents.'

Defence counsel Nadia Chbat said Chambers’ judgement in using Facebook had been flawed.

She said: 'His use of Facebook became prolific. The addictive nature of Facebook gave the illusion that these people were friends. It took bite of this young man in a catastrophic way.'

He was sentenced to three years and nine months in total and was banned from using a social networking site for six years as part of a sexual offences prevention order.

He was also placed on the sex offenders register for life.

Speaking after the case investigating officer Detective Sergeant Sally Kestin, of the Child Abuse Investigation Unit at Thames Valley Police, said:

'Ryan Chambers is a very dangerous and predatory young man who has a prolific desire to groom his victims in order to sexually abuse them.

'He would use a number of profiles set up on Facebook to contact girls and request they add him as a friend.

'If a girl accepted his friend request he would initiate conversations with them through Facebook as a ploy to obtain their phone numbers.

'His ultimate aim was to entice them around to his home where he would encourage them to have sex with him.

'The sheer number of girls involved meant we had to carry out a thorough and sensitive investigation, working closely with local schools and relevant agencies from MK Council, who were very supportive of our enquiries.

'We sent out a letter to more than 800 parents asking them to speak to their children to see if they had made contact with Chambers through Facebook or by text between summer 2010 and July 2011.

'We had a fantastic response from parents who were pleased police were dealing with a case like this and provided us with information crucial to our inquiry.

'As a result of the investigation we established Chambers had sexually abused four girls, all aged between 13 and 15 years old, and I would like to pay tribute to their bravery in disclosing the offences against them.'
