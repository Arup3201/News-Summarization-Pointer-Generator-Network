A cruel or thoughtless comment about a woman's size can stay with her for life, let alone one made at a particularly vulnerable time such as in the bedroom. 

But one woman has turned a crushing comment by her then boyfriend into an incentive to get fit and lose an incredible 13st.

Paige Way, 22, who once weighed 23st, was left humiliated when her boyfriend told her her stomach was getting in the way of love making during a romantic getaway to celebrate their one-year anniversary.

Paige managed to turn the cruel comment about the size of her stomach into motivation to change her life for the better, transforming herself from a size 28 to a size 12

Despite being hurt, Paige was prompted to embark on a diet that has seen her drop an amazing eight dress sizes from a size 28 to size 12.

Paige, from Sydenham, South East London, said: 'It was absolutely mortifying when my boyfriend told me that my belly was getting in the way, but it gave me the push I needed to finally do something about my weight.

'I'd always been big as a child, and then I was 'the fat one' in my bunch of friends. Men would say horrible things about me on nights out, like 'God, look at the size of her.'

'I had no confidence whatsoever, but I tried to kid myself that I was happy being fat.

'Even when I broke a sun lounger at a family barbecue by sitting on it, I just laughed it off.

Paige originally lost 8st on a juice diet but after suffering detrimental health effects switched to a more sustainable healthy eating plan and lost a further 5st,  in total dropping from 23st (left) to 10st (right)  

'However, when my boyfriend made that comment, I knew I couldn't kid myself any longer.'

Office worker Paige had spent years gorging on shop-bought sandwiches, biscuits and chocolate.

A regular visitor to McDonald's, she would eat two burger meals and fries, followed by a McFlurry and a large milkshake.

And during the day, she would guzzle a 2-litre bottle of full-fat Coke.

By the age of 21, her weight had soared to 23st and her BMI was a dangerous 57 - nearly three times the recommended range of 18.5 to 25.

In March 2013, doctors diagnosed 5ft 3in Paige as morbidly obese and told her she was at risk of having a heart attack. They also warned her that if she didn't ditch the fizzy drinks, her teeth would fall out.

Paige said: 'I was absolutely mortified. Deep down I knew that my health was suffering because of my weight, but I'd always tried to deny it.

'I was constantly tired and short of breath. If I was walking for the bus, I'd have to stop for a break. And my feet were covered in massive blisters from the pressure of carrying my body around.

'By the time I got to work, I was dripping in sweat and my makeup was running off my face. It was horrible.'

Her diet has totally changed, having ditched the fast food and fizz and adopted a diet of fresh healthy foods

In July 2013, Paige decided to finally do something about her size. She ended her relationship and embarked on a diet that has seen her more than halve her body weight.

Initially, she began a juicing diet and lost 8st in just 90 days. But she suffered horrific side effects, including hair loss and stomach cramps.

Paige said: 'It was horrendous. I was pleased that the weight was coming off, but I felt terrible. My periods stopped, and I was an emotional wreck.

'After three months, I just couldn't cope with it any longer and decided to lose weight in a healthier way.'

For the next eight months, Paige ate small portions of healthy food such as fruit, salad and bran flakes.

Combined with a weekly five-mile walk with her younger sister, Darcy, 19, Paige lost a further 5st  - taking her total weight loss to an impressive 13st by May 2014.

Paige, who now weighs just 10st, says that her weight-loss has completely changed her life and she regrets waiting so long to make a change.

She said: 'I've never felt better about myself. All of my family keep telling me how great I look, and for the first time in my life, I actually feel it.

'I think that anyone who feels uncomfortable about their body should take the plunge and do something about it. If I can do it, then anyone can.'

Now on the lookout for Mr Right, single Paige said that she is actually grateful to her ex for shaming her into losing weight (left, Paige before, right, her now) 

However, Paige admits that her transformation has also led to the loss of friends, who are jealous that she now steals their limelight.

Paige said: 'When I go out now, I like to look glamorous. I finally feel confident in myself and I like showing off my body.

'I never used to get any attention from men, so it's nice to get the odd wolf-whistle or guy asking for my number.

'I have had friends come up to me and tell me that they can't go out with me anymore because I'm getting all of the attention that they used to get.

'It's a shame that they can't be happy for me, but at least now I know who my real friends are.'

Now on the lookout for Mr Right, single Paige said that she is actually grateful to her ex for shaming her into losing weight.

She added: 'Every time I think back to the night at the hotel, it makes me cringe. But it made me make a change.

'Now I'm happier than I've ever been - and I definitely haven't had any complaints about my belly since!'
