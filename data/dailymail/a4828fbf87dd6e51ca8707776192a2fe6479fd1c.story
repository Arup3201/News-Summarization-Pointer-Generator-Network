A 46-year-old woman literally crashed an Ohio party after plowing her Jeep through a backyard fence and plunging into a swimming pool.

Emergency crews said the unidentified motorist hit a car on Lake Avenue before rolling up a 
driveway and busting through the wooden fence of an apartment complex about 6pm yesterday.

The Jeep splashed into the water, narrowly missing two swimmers and numerous guests standing nearby.

'I took a dive into the pool and when I hit the water, I was like ‘Oh man, that’s an awesome explosion I did',' party-goer Christopher Sanford told WEWS-TV. 'Then, I turned around (and) there was a Jeep in the pool.'

Party's over: A 46-year-old motorist narrowly missed hitting a bunch of party-goers after crashing a Jeep into an Ohio backyard and into a swimming pool on Saturday

Sanford, 27, described how he pulled aside the driver's 
seat belt and dragged her through the open window onto the pool deck.

He 
said the woman was struggling to breathe 'and kept saying her brakes were 
bad.'

Another guest, John Justice, said people had 'spent about 80 percent of the time at this end
 of the pool' earlier in the day.

Homeowner Trent Wilson lamented that it was the first time this season he'd opened up his pool.

'If there wasn't a pool here, there'd be bodies,' Wilson told Cleveland.com. 'I'm lucky to be alive...I'm just glad no one got badly hurt.'
