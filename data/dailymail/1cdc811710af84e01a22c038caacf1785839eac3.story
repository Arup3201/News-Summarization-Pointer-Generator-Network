Victim: Stuhlman was out walking his dog at 8:30 p.m. last Thursday on the 6400 block of Woodcrest Avenue when police said he was approached by three juveniles attempting a robbery

Police said that both Hamilton and Smith have been charged with murder and robbery, and each have confessed to carrying out the murder, according to Action News.

However, officers have not yet located the murder weapon, but have received information on where it is located.

Stuhlman was out walking his dog at 8:30 p.m. last Thursday on the 6400 block of Woodcrest Avenue when police said he was approached by three juveniles attempting a robbery. 

The father-of-one allegedly pleaded for his life saying, 'Please don't shoot me. Please don't shoot me.' But he was shot once in the chest. The suspects did not manage to get anything from him.

Philadelphia Police Captain James Clark said: 'It is even more senseless, and even more troubling that nothing was taken at all and he lost his life.'

The boys were all caught on surveillance camera as they ran off into the night. They were all wearing hoodies and backpacks, raising suspicions that they could be schoolboys.

Crime: Neighbors told Action News Stuhlman, a landscaper, usually walked the dog at night with his 13-year-old daughter, but was alone on the night that he was shot, effectively saving her life

Senseless: Philadelphia Police Captain James Clark said: 'It is even more senseless, and even more troubling that nothing was taken at all and he lost his life'

Police apprehended a group of boys fitting their description and searched the home where two of the boys lived at 64th Street and Girard Avenue. 

There, they recovered numerous assault rifles and hand guns and charges were filed against the teens.

The boys allegedly told police that they were out playing basketball, and came up with the idea that they wanted to commit a robbery.

As they walked down the street, they initially targeted another man, police said, but settled on Stuhlman because he looked 'less intimidating.'

Neighbors told Action News Stuhlman, a landscaper, usually walked his dog at night with his 13-year-old daughter, but was alone on the night that he was shot.

Captain Clark said:'My understanding is that his daughter goes for a walk with him almost every night. 

'For whatever reason he said to her, 'It's a little late tonight. I don't want you walking with me.' So in effect, he possibly saved his daughter's life as well.'
