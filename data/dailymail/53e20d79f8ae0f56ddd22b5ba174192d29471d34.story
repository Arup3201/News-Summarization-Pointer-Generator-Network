Online shoppers may not be getting the best deal on Christmas presents as the price of this year's hottest toys are sold for as much as £30 above their recommended price.

As millions of people prepare to place their orders during 'Cyber Monday' tomorrow, customers are being urged to check they are not paying over the odds.

Third-party sellers on Amazon change their prices depending on the demand for a product.

Confusing: Parents shopping for the Christmas must-have toys such as Furby, pictured, may be paying more online. Furby was priced on Amazon at £84.95 - almost £25 above its recommended price

It means the price of an item can change significantly within just a few hours and leave shoppers confused about whether they are getting the best deal.

The Sunday Times found the price of a Furby toy - one of 2012's most wanted gifts - went from £71.70 to £84.95 within six hours. It has a RRP of £59.99.

The price of toy gun the Nerf N-Strike Elite Hail Fire was £43.99 on Wednesday but the following day was on sale for £49.11 - £15 more than it was being sold for at Tesco Direct

As the supply of a product falls - including in-demand Christmas toys - prices tend to increase.

Third-party sellers on Amazon use complicated equations to price items according to supply and demand.

Amazon.co.uk's own products are not priced in the same way.

American software company Teikametrics provides services to third-party sellers.

Chief executive Alasdair McLean-Foreman told the Sunday newspaper: 'In the same way that you have stock-market trading techniques, we've built the same type of software for retailers.

In demand: Lego Friends: Olivia's House, pictured, is one of 2012's Top Toys for Christmas. It was being sold at one stage for £20 above the £69.99 recommended price

Boys toy: Within one day last week the NERF N-Strike Elite Hail-fire toy rose in price by £6

'You might not want to sell now; you might want to wait until a competitor who is willing to sell at a very low price has sold out.'

However, other retailers said some soaring prices for the most popular items are 'outrageous'.

Gary Grant, found of Entertainer, the UK's largest independent toy retailer, told the Sunday Times: 'As a company we have made the decision that we should treat all customers fairly and our online prices should reflect those offered in stores.

He said the demand for Furby toys are one-third more than availability.

He said: 'That's why you will see traders on Amazon selling the £60 Furby for £80, £90 or £100. It is outrageous. I'm disappointed to be seeing that.'

Tomorrow - dubbed Cyber Monday - will be one of the two busiest online shopping days of the year - along with Black Friday.

Busy: Workers at Amazon, such as those pictured here at the warehouse in Rugeley, Staffordshire, received an order every 35 seconds on Friday

During Friday, staff at Amazon's plant in Rugeley, Staffordshire, received an order about every 35 seconds.

The American tradition was introduced by Amazon to Britain in 2010, giving a bargain-hunters discounts of up to 40 per cent on hundreds of products.

Savings will continue tomorrow. On the same day last year Amazon received orders for more than three million items.

Customers can attempt to battle against the fluctuating online prices by using websites such as decide.com, which track items on Amazon and notify people when the price goes down.

Mike Fridgen, chief executive of decide.com, told the Sunday Times: 'Prices can change dozens of times in any given day and that is very confusing for customers.

'So we're also using data and algorithms to help consumers fight against that to get a better deal and let them decide when to press the trigger at the best price.'
