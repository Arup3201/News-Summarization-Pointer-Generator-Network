Standing down: Sir Trevor Booking will retire from his role at the FA after the World Cup

Sir Trevor Brooking will retire from his role as the FA's director of football development after the World Cup.

The FA has announced that Brooking has decided to leave English football's governing body after 11 years in the role.

During his time at the FA, Brooking has been a keen advocate of improving coaching and playing standards at grassroots level.

Throughout his time with the FA, Brooking has been responsible for restructuring the framework of coach and player development.

The 65-year-old was one of the biggest supporters of the building of St George's Park, the national football centre in Burton-upon-Trent.

Brooking, who played 47 times for England, said: 'I believe now is the right time to step away from my full-time role at The FA and I feel extremely positive about the future of football development moving forward.

'Under the leadership and guidance of (director of elite development) Dan Ashworth and (Under-21s coach) Gareth Southgate, we have now put in place a strong, credible, elite structure to support the professional game.

'They also appreciate how crucial it is to work in tandem with our grassroots infrastructure who've always been a consistent supporter of our work programmes across coaching and player development.'

England manager Roy Hodgson said: 'Trevor is a football man and has been a great friend to me both before and during my time as England manager. He was a fine footballer, one that any England team would be grateful of, and he has proven to be equally adept in his role at the FA.

'I hope he has a happy and healthy retirement and I know that is a sentiment echoed by the entire England staff and squad.'
