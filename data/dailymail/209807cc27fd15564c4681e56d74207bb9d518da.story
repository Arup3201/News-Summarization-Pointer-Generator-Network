Passengers kicked up a stink on a flight from Beijing to Detroit this week after a family allowed their toddler to defecate on his seat, according to reports.

Travellers on board the Delta Airlines flight allegedly watched in horror as the young Chinese boy's parents laid down newspaper on his chair and encouraged him to relieve himself there and then.

Despite pleas from passengers and crew to take him to the cabin toilet, the boy's grandfather and grandmother - who were also on the plane - insisted on letting the boy settle there, it was claimed.

Causing a stink: The alleged incident happened on board a Delta Airlines flight from Beijing to Detroit last week

Passenger Luolan Gang Wang told Sina News that once the boy had finished his business, its smell began slowly to waft through the cabin sparking a wave of disgust among fellow travellers.

Following the incident, Chinese social network Weibo came alive with commenters expressing their disgust, many of whom condemned the family for embarrassing their homeland.

Delta Airlines did not immediately respond to MailOnline's request for comment. It is not clear exactly when the alleged incident happened but it is believed to have occurred some time around the middle of last week.

It comes months after a disturbingly similar incident in which a child was photographed passing motion on a domestic flight in China in February.
