The body of a little girl, age 4 or 5, has been found under a tarp in the middle of a suburban intersection outside Fort Worth, Texas.

Teenagers who found the girl in the city of Saginaw, Texas, on Monday night say the girl's hands and feet were bound. She had a plastic bag over her head and she was naked, except for a pair of purple underwear.

By Tuesday morning, the FBI and local police executed a search warrant at her parents' house - about a mile and a half from where the girl's body was found.

Authorities say her parents reported the girl missing, though they are not sure whether that was before or after her body was found

Searching: Police executed a search warrant on the girl's parents' home on Tuesday morning. The house is located about a mile and a half from where the body was found

Teenagers playing in the street made the chilling discovery about 7.30pm after their 
parents told them to clean up a tarp that had been dumped in the road.

The children assumed that a passerby had dumped garbage in the neighborhood. Instead, to their horror, they found the girl's body.

'At first, I just thought it was some rubber stuff at first, and then I got a closer look and all I saw was a bag and I saw some hair sticking out and so, I was like, "Oh my God! It’s a girl!"' Josh Smith, 18, told KXAS-TV.

'And that’s when I dropped to my knees and just started crying.'

Smith says he never again will be able to leave his house without thinking about the little girl he found near his front door.

The news shocked neighbors in the quiet community.

Murder: The FBI has joined the investigation after the horrifying discovery. No children from the area have been reported missing, so the case starts with few leads

FBI agents combed the area searching for evidence. The body was dumped in a conspicuous spot in a suburban neighborhood in Saginaw

'I was panicking. I was freaked out. 
How can somebody hurt a little girl?' said Katie Whiddon, the mother of 
one of the teenagers who discovered the body, told KTVT-TV.

The FBI and Texas Rangers have joined Saginaw police in investigating the case, which is being called a murder.

The cause of death is not yet known.

Ms Whiddon told KDFW-TV that the girl was naked and bound and had a plastic grocery bag over her head.

By daybreak on Tuesday, authorities discovered the identity of the girl and were interviewing her parents.They also executed a search warrant on the house.

Neighbors told KDFW that the girl's father went door-to-door last night about 8pm asking if anyone had seen his daughter.

Her body was found about 7.30pm. It is unclear whether her parents reported her missing before or after her body was found.

The girl's home is located about a mile and a half from the crime scene where her body was found.

The girl's body was found in Saginaw, Texas, a city of 20,000 outside Forth Worth

Coping: Neighbors quickly set up a makeshift memorial on the curb for the little girl, whose identity remains a mystery

Pink toys belonging to a small child could be seen in the front yard of the home.

Police do not know why the body was dumped in such a conspicuous spot. They say it may have accidentally fallen out of the vehicle that was carrying it.

Neighbors say they noticed a red pickup truck with a green splotch on the rear passenger-side panel in the neighborhood shortly before the body was found.

Investigators believe the driver may have something to do with the body and have asked anyone with information about the truck to come forward.

FBI agents could be seen Monday night combing the block where the body was found, searching for possible clues.

Neighbors set up a makeshift memorial of flowers and teddy bears on the curb near where the girl was found in an attempt to cope with the disturbing discovery.
