Jeremy Bamber's father had a premonition that there would be a shooting shortly before he, his wife, and their daughter and grandsons were shot dead, it was revealed today.

Nevill Bamber, who was murdered with his family by their adopted son Jeremy in their Essex farmhouse in August 1986, told his farm secretary he thought he might die in a serious shooting accident just weeks before the slaughter.

Barbara Wilson, who worked at the Bambers' farm before and after the murders, has told a new investigation that the atmosphere at White House Farm in Tolleshunt d'Arcy changed dramatically a few months beforehand.

She said the elder Mr Bamber looked tired and worried and told her he feared something appalling was going to happen.

Mrs Wilson said: 'For some weeks he looked really drawn and ill.  He seemed to stoop and seemed to have the worries of the world on his shoulders.

'I thought he might have cancer... He said he hadn't got anything like that but he had got great problems.

'I asked him to elaborate and he said that he thought he might die.  I said "What makes you think that?" and he said there might be a serious shooting accident.'

'Knowing what had been going on, [I] thought that he knew that Jeremy was going to perhaps shoot him.'

Weeks later, Nevill and June Bamber, their model daughter Sheila, 28, and her six-year-old twins Nicholas and Daniel were shot dead at the Essex farmhouse.

Accused of the murders, privately-educated Jeremy Bamber told the court his father rang him in the middle of the night to say that Sheila had gone mad, before the phone went dead. 

He claimed his sister, who developed schizophrenia, had shot everyone before shooting herself, but prosecutors said this was impossible because a silencer was found with Sheila's blood on it, and Bamber was found guilty on a 10-2 majority verdict.

In a TV interview for a new documentary, Countdown To Murder, Mrs Wilson said that Bamber, now 52, would provoke his mother, June, by riding his bike round and round her in circles, trying to hit her.

She said he also once left a bag of live rats in his adopted mother's car, while he would torment his magistrate father by wearing make-up in public.

Mrs Wilson added: 'Jeremy would put over a face of being a very sort of nice person and then he would go and do something really nasty...

'There seemed to be an awful lot of bickering.  Sometimes when Jeremy came up they would have a hectic row... Whenever Jeremy was around the atmosphere was so different.'

She said that when Bamber took over his father's farm after the murders, she never once saw him grieving for his family.

'I wanted to shout out to him "I know what you've done" but I didn't have the guts to do it....

'I think I might have ended up the same way as Mr and Mrs Bamber.'

Detectives investigating the murder found a silencer with Sheila's blood on it.

It was argued that without a silencer, the 25 shots that were fired would have alerted the victims to the danger.  And if the silencer had been attached to the gun, it would have been too long for Sheila to have shot herself with it.

The prosecution argued that Jeremy Bamber had no interest in inheriting his father's business, but wanted the £436,000 family fortune. 

When Nevill Bamber offered his son a job on the farm in 1986, it was the catalyst for the younger man, who lived in a cottage provided by his parents a few miles away, to plan a way to get the money for himself.

Bamber, one of only 38 prisoners in England and Wales serving a whole-life sentence, has pleaded innocence consistently since he was sent to jail in September 1986.

However despite several appeals and reviews, and despite former Tory MP Andrew Hunter saying last month that he believed Bamber was innocent, the mass murderer remains in jail.

Slaughter At The Farm: Countdown To Murder will be shown on Channel 5 on 14 November at 9pm.
