A three-year-old boy with epilepsy has been free of seizures for six months after surgeons ‘disconnected’ half of his brain.

Ernie Djedje, from Sheffield, had up to 100 devastating seizures a day before the pioneering surgery.

Each severe seizure caused him to forget all of the skills he had learnt meaning his parents, Kelly and Franck, had to keep teaching him to sit up and crawl over and over again.

Mrs Djedje said: ‘Ernie’s has not had one seizure since his operation in June 2013 and it has transformed his life.

‘There is a huge difference in Ernie, it’s like having a different child as his development was affected but he’s now learning new things all the time.

‘Before the operation he had the abilities of a three-month-old, but since then he’s been making improvements all the time.

‘He is more like a nine-month-old now, and wants to stand and try and walk, which wasn’t possible before. He will always need additional support because of his health issues, but it is fantastic that Ernie is no longer having seizures.’

Ernie was diagnosed with West Syndrome – a severe form of epilepsy that affects babies and young children – when he was just six weeks old.

His parents took him to hospital because they noticed his face was twitching and were given the shocking diagnosis.

Ernie's fits could not be controlled with medication so doctors operated to disconnect the two hemispheres of his brain in a bid to stop his seizures. He has not had a fit since the operation took place in August 2013

Mrs Djedje told MailOnline: ‘I had never heard of West Syndrome. I was very upset when I was told but I knew I had to get on with it.’

West Syndrome causes seizures that tend to make the baby either bow forwards or lean backwards.

It occurs in about one in every 2,500 to 3,000 children.

In 90 per cent of sufferers, the spasms first occur before they are one.

West Syndrome is a form of epilepsy that affects babies and young children.

It causes seizures in which the child appears to either bow forward or lean backwards.

It occurs in about one in every 2,500 to 3,000 children.

90 per cent of those affected develop symptoms within their first year of life.

The condition is usually treated with drugs initially and if this is not successfully, the child may require surgery.

Most children with the condition go on to develop other kinds of seizures in later childhood and most also have learning difficulties.

The long-term prognosis for children with West Syndrome depends mainly on the cause and the severity of the syndrome.

Babies who have these spasms often have slow development and their development can even go backwards.

Some patients respond well to treatment while others continue to have spasms despite drug treatment.

Most West Syndrome sufferers tend to go on to develop other kinds of seizures in later childhood and most have learning difficulties.

Ernie’s epilepsy was completely out of control despite a strict drug regime.

This meant he had as many as 100 seizures a day which each lasted from between 30 seconds and six minutes.

These seizures affected his development and meant he needed constant supervision.

Every time he learnt to do something – like to sit up – he would have a severe seizure and the skill would be wiped out.

His parents were also having to call an ambulance frequently when they were unable to stop him fitting.

Mrs Djedje, 34, said: ‘Before Ernie had the surgery he was on medication but his condition became so severe he was having up to 100 seizures a day.

‘It affected Ernie’s development, so he’d learn things, and then lose the ability. He became so ill that an operation was needed to stop the seizures.’

When Ernie was two, his doctors at 
The Children’s Hospital, Sheffield, suggested that he have an operation 
to ‘disconnect’ the two hemisphere of his brain in the hope this would 
stop his seizures.

Mrs Djedje said: ‘When I was told about the operation I was shocked because you don’t think about having your brain separated.

‘But, I just wanted to stop the seizures.’

In a desperate bid to help their son, Mr and Mrs Djedje agreed to allow him to have the eight hour procedure which was carried out in August at Birmingham Children’s Hospital.

During the operation – which is called a hemispherectomy - surgeons made a large cut above Ernie’s ear, and through his skull, to allow them access to his brain.

They then disconnected the outer layer of one half of the brain - the half that was causing the seizures – from the other half.

They carried out a procedure called a hemispherectomy.

This involved disconnecting the outer layer of one half of his brain - the half that was causing the seizures - from the other half.

In doing so, they disconnected the communication between the two hemispheres preventing the spread of electrical seizures from one side of the brain to the other.

Cutting the connection between the 
two sides of the brain disconnects the communication between the two 
hemispheres preventing the spread of electrical seizures from one side 
of the brain to the other.

The
 Children’s Hospital, Sheffield neurological consultant, Chris Rittey, 
said: ‘The operation was necessary as Ernie had such a severe form of 
epilepsy. 

‘We worked closely with colleagues in Birmingham to prepare him for surgery and it is fantastic that he is now seizure-free.’

Richard
 Walsh, the Birmingham Children’s Hospital brain surgeon who carried out
 the procedure, said: ‘This was a very complicated and long operation 
and we are all delighted with how well Ernie is doing. We look forward 
to seeing Ernie as an outpatient next year.’

Mrs Djedje said that Ernie, who is 
also partially paralysed on one side, started to show improvements about
 a week after his operation and that he is now completely free of 
seizures.

She told MailOnline: ‘It’s the best thing we have ever decided to do for him.

‘It means everything – everything has improved.’

Mr
 and Mrs Djedje, who also have a six-year-old son called Alfie, are now 
looking forward to life without Ernie being affected by seizures.

Mrs Djedje told MailOnline: 'I am so grateful to the surgeons - they have changed his life and they have changed our lives. They are absolutely fantastic. We will be happy if he stays seizure free and if he stays happy'

Mrs Djedje said: ‘When he was ill he couldn’t sleep because of the seizures and so neither could we. So Ernie being well rested makes a difference to us all.

‘We’re also able to go out more as a family, because when Ernie was ill we couldn’t go out if he was having a bad day.’

Ernie is now able to retain what he has learnt and, while he can’t talk or feed himself, he is having physiotherapy to try and help him stand.

Mrs Djedje told MailOnline: ‘I am so grateful to the surgeons – they have changed his life and they have changed our lives. They are absolutely fantastic.

‘We will be happy if he stays seizure free and if he stays happy.’
