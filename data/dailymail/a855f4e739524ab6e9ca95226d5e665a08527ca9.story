A MOTHER was acting on her ‘instincts’ on the day she abducted four of her five children in a tug-of-love battle to prevent them living with their father in Spain, the High Court heard yesterday.

Jennifer Jones had been due to hand over the children last October, but two of them became so ‘traumatised’ that she instinctively decided to keep them with her instead, she said.

She then went into hiding with all four of them – and as a result she now faces jail for allegedly breaching a High Court order to return them.

Spanish courts had granted her former 
husband, Tomas Palacin Cambra, custody of the five children to live in 
Majorca when the marriage ended in 2008.

Last summer the four youngest spent a 
holiday with Miss Jones, 47, in Britain. But at the end of the holiday, 
rather than send them back to Spain, she enrolled them in schools in her
home town of Llanelli, South Wales, while she started custody 
proceedings.

She then went on the run for 30 hours 
after the High Court ruled they should be returned to their father 
following an application from a Spanish court using child abduction laws
under The Hague Convention.

Yesterday lawyers for the Solicitor 
General argued at the High Court that Miss Jones was in contempt for not
upholding the order and returning her children.

But Miss Jones told the court that on 
the day the children were supposed to be handed over to her former 
husband in Cardiff, two of them were ‘traumatised’ and had run to the 
local police station in Llanelli. Her lawyers argued that this meant she
had been unable to comply with the court order.

Miss Jones said: ‘I was very worried about everything. Those children didn’t want to go back [to Spain]. It was pretty clear.

‘All I knew was that my daughter and my son had run away and escaped. I was very concerned about my children.

‘I was so frightened because I knew I 
was supposed to be in Cardiff. I was going through a lot of emotions. As
a mother you go by your instincts.’

The Family Division of the High Court 
had ruled that the children should be returned to their father in 
October last year. When Miss Jones failed to return them to Spain, judge
Mr Justice Wood ordered that the children should be taken from her home
by police and social services.

But when they arrived Miss Jones and 
the four children had packed up and gone. They were found in Blackwood, 
Gwent, 60 miles from her home, just over a day later.

English language teacher Miss Jones 
and her boyfriend John Williams, 48, a builder, were held in custody and
the children taken to foster carers. Colonel Cambra, 53, a Spanish army
officer, flew from his home in Majorca with their eldest daughter, 
Sara, 17, to collect all of the children.

But they returned home with only Eva, 
ten, and David, eight. Jessica, 15, and Tomas, 13, remained with their 
mother as the court decided their future.

Speaking outside court, Miss Jones 
told the Daily Mail she was ‘devastated’ by the ordeal and had not seen 
her other three children since they returned to Spain.

The family have previously revealed 
handwritten letters by the children begging family court judges not to 
be sent back to Spain with their father.

In one, Jessica writes to the judge: ‘I am not happy at all… I do not want to go to Spain’, underlining the word ‘not’.

Miss Jones met Colonel Cambra when he 
was a captain while she was teaching English in Tenerife. They were 
married in 1996 and lived in the Canary Islands  and Ibiza but 
frequently returned to Wales to stay with Miss  Jones’s family.

The family were in the process of 
building a luxury home in Catalonia in 2008 when Miss Jones and the 
children returned to Llanelli for ten months.

Colonel Cambra claims their mother made the children make false allegations about his treatment of them.

Miss Jones was spared jail after being
found guilty of ‘flagrant breaches’ of court orders to return them by 
the Family Division of the High Court in October.

But the matter was referred to the 
Solicitor General, Oliver Heald, who decided that she should face 
contempt of court charges for breaching the order.

Sir James Munby, president of the Family Division of the  High Court, reserved judgment until today.
