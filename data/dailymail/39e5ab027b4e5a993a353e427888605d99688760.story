Slim hope: Lydia with her Malory band

On my birthday, my mother cooked me a celebratory dinner. The highlight was my favourite fish pie. A wantonly gorgeous creation made with lashings of cream, it's a dish I'd argue my mother is the best at cooking, probably in the whole world.

Politeness as well as greed demanded I do full justice to her efforts; but as I reached out for a second helping - homing in on the lovely crispy, cheesy bits around the edges - an ominous tightness in my stomach warned me to put my plate down immediately. My new weight-loss aid was making its presence felt again.

From surgery to drugs to smart bracelets which monitor calorie intake and output, the scientific solutions for tackling obesity seem to get ever more complex.

Which makes it all the more surprising that the latest weight-loss wonder to capture the public imagination is very little more than a piece of string.

The Malory Band is a woven polyester cord that you wear around your waist. Eat too much at one sitting, and the cord digs into your stomach. And that's basically it. 

At £39.95, it isn't cheap. The woman behind it, TV presenter and life coach Penny Mallory, calls it 'your best friend if you want to change the way you eat and exercise'.

And, amazingly, it's proved a smash-hit. The bands have been flying off the shelves in more than 100 countries after receiving worldwide attention from the Press. Online forums are now filled with women praising its simplicity and miraculous effects on their waistlines. 

A similar technique was said to have been used in Egyptian times, and our Victorian great-grandmothers also apparently tied cords around their waists to keep track of their tums.

So is it, literally, just money for old rope? Or is there method behind the apparent madness?

Having tried innumerable weight-loss regimes, the simplicity of this solution really appealed to me. No banned foods, no mandatory exercise, no need even for willpower: it just relies on inflicting mild discomfort to discourage overeating.

It would be like having a gastric band, but without any risk of post-operative complications.

My waist measurement is 75cm, so I ordered a Malory Band in a size 10-14. It measured just under 90cm, and looked like a rather sophisticated belly chain.

In plaited grey and white cord, it has loops along its length and silver stops at either end. You fit the cord around your waist, then push the stop through the loop to keep it at the desired circumference.

It's invisible, except when worn under the tightest of body-con dresses (which you probably won't be wearing if you think you need a Malory Band.) I tied it so that it sat comfortably around my muffin top and went to show it to my husband.

'Hell-o!' he said in his best Leslie Phillips manner. 'I like it!' He's never said that about any of my control-top knickers. I think he liked the belly-dancer look.

At first, the band and I got along fine. When I went to my fitness class at the gym, I was briefly aware of the metal ends knocking against my hip before I forgot about it.

'The band wasn't so much a 
best friend as an ill-informed dietitian who disapproved of whatever I 
chose to put into my mouth - however healthy it might be. And
my reaction to this constant nagging was to eat more.'

I showered with it on - it dried quickly - but afterwards, getting dressed, I became aware of some rather strange looks from my fellow gym-bunnies.

Either they were all aware of the Malory Band and were checking out how effective it was, or I looked as though I was working the belly-dancer vibe too hard for a women-only changing room on a rainy Monday morning.

Afterwards, I decided it was time to set the band a test, so I popped into a café for a cappuccino and a croissant. As I munched, I waited tensely for something to happen. But my waistband felt as loose as ever, which perversely made me feel as though I was still being healthy. 

Lunch was a different story. I made myself a large but blameless broccoli salad, but as my stomach filled up, the band began to make its presence felt.

Clearly, the fibre in the raw veg was making me bloat. I now realised that the low-tech qualities of the Malory Band obviously had their limitations; if I'd eaten a chocolate bar instead I'd have taken in far more empty calories without discomfort.

The band also appeared to have issues with my posture. Returning to my desk to work, I found I had to sit bolt upright to prevent it digging in.

By the time I went to bed, I had an unflattering red line etched into my stomach. I slept in it, and had wild nightmares of being trapped somewhere. At 4am, waking in a rage, I took it off and flung it to the floor.

Jumping on the Malory band wagon: A mistake

The next day, I reluctantly put it on again. My stomach had slimmed down overnight. Once again, it felt comfortable (although I'd lost track of my original waist measurement). But by the end of the day, I had to loosen it once more. 

There were interesting aspects to wearing the Malory Band. Now I know which foods make me bloat: pasta, apples and broccoli were particular culprits. I made a mental note to avoid eating any of them before a party. 

Otherwise, the band wasn't so much a best friend as an ill-informed dietitian who disapproved of whatever I chose to put into my mouth - however healthy it might be.

And my reaction to this constant nagging was to eat more, just to prove I was in charge of my body, and hadn't handed over control to this bossy piece of string.

So when it started to bite into me at my birthday dinner, it was the final straw. I took it off with a sense of enormous relief. Which is possibly why, when I stepped on the scales after a week of wearing the Malory Band, I discovered to my dismay that I'd actually put on 1lb. 

In the longer term, I can see how wearing the band might work. Numerous scientific studies have proved that waist measurement is an important indicator of health. And if you've reached your target weight and are determined to stay there, that constant reminder not to eat another mouthful might be very helpful. 

But my personality doesn't work like that. I hate being niggled at, and my waist size seems to fluctuate quite significantly over the course of a normal day, whatever I'm eating.

And as the band made me feel permanently fat and rather glum, I found myself reaching for the consoling biscuits rather more than I usually do.

The technique might have worked for the Egyptians and the Victorians, but personally I'm still putting my faith in science rather than string.
