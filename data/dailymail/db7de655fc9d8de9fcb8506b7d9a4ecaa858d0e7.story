Most women spend months hunting for the perfect wedding dress but for one romantic bride, the gown of her dreams was to be found a little closer to home.

Lucy Popovic, 31, was married wearing a stunning vintage dress that had already been up the aisle twice before - on her mother and grandmother.

First used by her grandmother Mel in 1950, the dress had its second outing in 1974 when Mel's daughter Peggy wore it for her big day before being used for a third time by Lucy.

The off-white dress was bought for six guineas - the equivalent of around £172 today - for grandmother Mel's marriage to Ian Calder in London's South Kensington.

The dress was then worn by Mel’s daughter Penny in 1974 when she married Harry Dafforn at Hampton Court in Surrey.

Lucy, from Solva in Pembrokeshire, decided to continue the tradition and wore the dress when she married her Australian husband Mark Popovic, 35.

Lucy, who works in construction, revealed: 'It was a quite nerve racking time because we only got back to 
Wales a couple of weeks before the wedding and I hadn’t tried the dress 
on for about ten years, so we weren’t 100 per cent sure that it would 
fit.

'It was obviously 
meant to be because it fitted perfectly. It’s pretty amazing that the 
three of us were all the same size. The dress needed a new zip and some 
of the hems re-sewed.'

She added: 'I felt really lucky to be able to wear the same dress that both my mum and grandma had worn.

'The dress you get married in holds such special memories and it was really lovely to wear a dress with so much family history.

'I had always thought the dress was beautiful and hoped that one day I would get to wear it.'

Lucy, whose wedding date coincided with her grandparents 62nd wedding anniversary, added:

'It had extra significance to be able to share it with them [her grandparents] and it will be something we will always treasure.

'My grandparents have had such a long and happy marriage and we hope we will be celebrating both wedding anniversaries for many years to come.'

Lucy moved to Australia seven years ago to live with her partner Mark but flew back to her home town for her seaside wedding in June.

Before she could wear the dress, it had to be cleaned with a homemade mixture of aspirin and white vinegar.

'I found the dress looking rather grubby,' said Lucy's mother Penny, 59. 'I researched stain removal for silk on the internet, and after several crushed aspirin and white vinegar stain removals, it looked perfect on Lucy.'
