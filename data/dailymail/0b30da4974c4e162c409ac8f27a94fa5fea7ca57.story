Record-breaking multiple Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps was arrested on Tuesday morning on suspicion of driving under the influence.

The arrest took place in Baltimore City, Maryland, the 29-year-old's home state, according to TMZ Sports.

This marks the decorated swimmer's second DUI arrest. Phelps was arrested in 2004 at age 19 for DUI and later received 18 months probation.

Police arrested Phelps after he was caught driving 84mph in a 45mph zone in Baltimore

It was after 1:30 when Maryland Transit Authority police pulled over Phelps' Land Rover on I-395.

They initiated a field sobriety test, which according to TMZ, he failed spectacularly and had nearly twice the legal B.A.C.

'He was unable to perform satisfactorily a series of standard field sobriety tests,' reads the MdTA statement. 'Mr. Phelps was cooperative throughout the process.'

The 18-time Olympic gold medal winning athlete was charged with for driving 84mph in a 45mph zone, police told TMZ, and for crossing double lane lines.

The last time news broke of Phelps' antics behind the wheel, it too took place in Maryland.

In 2004, then 19-year-old Phelps was arrested near Salisbury University in the city of Salisbury and charged with DUI, DWI, violation of a license restriction and failure to obey a stop sign.

As part of a plea deal, the rising sports star pleaded guilty to drunk driving and was sentenced to 18 months probation.

'I recognize the seriousness of this mistake,' Phelps told a judge in 2004 as 100 spectators looked on. 'I’ve learned from this mistake and will continue learning from this mistake for the rest of my life.' 

Phelps is the most decorated Olympian in sports history, winning 18 Olympic golds during his career
