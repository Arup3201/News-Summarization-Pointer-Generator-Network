Besieged theme park SeaWorld has launched its first major PR attack against Blackfish in an attempt to offset almost 12 months of damage caused by the chilling documentary, which chronicled the aquarium's 39-year treatment of killer whales in captivity.

Hit with cancellations from high-profile performers and school field trips, coupled with aggressive animal activist campaigns and a tarnished image, the Orlando-based marine park has placed full-page ads in eight of the country's largest newspapers, rationalizing their whale practices.

The 'Open Letter from SeaWorld's Animal Advocates' — which appears in today's Orlando Sentinel, New York Times, Wall Street Journal and USA Today, among other papers — defends the way SeaWorld cares for the 29 whales in its corporate collection.

Although it doesn't identify Blackfish, the ad is the first step in the company's move to rebut the wide-spread criticisms raised by the film, such as allegations that captivity turned orca Tilikum - the world's largest whale held in captivity - into a killer, according to The Orlando Sentinel.

Tragedy: Blackfish focuses on a 12,000lb orca named Tilikum - the world's largest killer whale held in captivity - who in 2010 dragged trainer Dawn Brancheau (pictured with Tilkum) underwater to her death at SeaWorld in Orlando, Florida. SeaWorld has staged a new campaign to react to the documentary's allegations

SeaWorld has previously dismissed the doco as propagandist and inaccurate.

'Tili' was responsible for the deaths of three people, most notably that of trainer Dawn Brancheau, who he grabbed and dragged underwater until she drowned during a 2010 training session in Florida.

The Oscar-buzzing documentary - which details Tilikum's life, starting with being forcibly removed from his family in 1983 near Iceland - claims the whale's living conditions effectively turned him into an aggressive killer.

It also includes scientific data saying there has never been one reported case of whales attacking humans in the wild.

After watching the critically-acclaimed film, rock star Joan Jett sent a cease and desist letter to Seaworld asking them to stop playing her song, I Love Rock 'n' Roll, as part of their Shamu Rocks shows.

Then eight of the 10 acts scheduled to headline SeaWorld's annual Bands, Brew & BBQ concert series - including Willie Nelson, Barenaked Ladies, Trisha Yearwood and Martina McBride - pulled out of the show citing the concerns raised by Blackfish.

McBride wrote on Facebook to her fans: 'Given all the issues that have been aired recently, the time isn't right for me to play at SeaWorld.'

Also this week, Point Dume Marine Science Elementary School in Malibu, California, dropped a long-scheduled field trip to the park, according to Fox 5.

For at least a decade the school has held an overnight excursion at SeaWorld for fifth-graders, however Principal Rebecca Johnson told CNN both parents and students had asked to go elsewhere this year.

SeaWorld President and Chief Executive Officer Jim Atchison said in an interview Thursday that the company decided to make statements regarding Blackfish only after losing their musical line-up.

'That ended up getting more coverage and became a story of its own, and, accordingly, what we wanted to do is to make sure that some of the misconceptions that were floating around related to that coverage were put to bed,' he told The Orlando Sentinel.

SeaWorld would not say how much it spent on the newspaper ads, which could soon be followed by an online campaign.

But the move suggests the company, whose 11 theme parks drew a combined 24.4 million visitors last year, is concerned about potential long-term brand damage from the small-budget film, which was just shortlisted for an Academy Award.

In its open letter, SeaWorld says it has invested $70 million improving its killer-whale habitats in the past three years.

SeaWorld's open letters ads, which appeared in newspaper around the country today, are on behalf of the marine park's 1,500 employees, it says

Much of that has been spent on safety upgrades implemented after Brancheau's death, which remains the subject of a legal battle between SeaWorld and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

SeaWorld says in its ad that the life spans of its killer whales are equivalent to those living in the wild, which contradicts claims by animal-rights groups.

A widely cited 1995 study found that the mortality rate of killer whales in captivity was about two and half times that of killer whales in the wild.

Blackfish claims whales in captivity live for about 25 years, while whales in the wild live to an age comparable to that of humans.

Christopher Dold, SeaWorld Entertainment's vice president of veterinary services, said the rate of survival for SeaWorld's whales is just as high as that of whales in the wild.

Regulations:  Following Brancheau's death, trainers were banned from going into the water with the performing animals and now have to be separated from the whales by glass. SeaWorld is appealing the decision

The Seaworld ad also says that it does not separate killer-whale calves from their mothers, aside from rare occasions when the mother cannot care for the calf herself.

But activists have compiled a long list of young killer whales separated from their mothers at SeaWorld parks.

The difference is one of definition: When SeaWorld says 'calf,' it is typically referring to whales still nursing, which can last until about two years of age.

Activists generally include juvenile and adolescent whales, which can be a decade or so older.

'They're just trying to take advantage of the difficulties in finding absolute numbers to compare,' Howard Garrett, director of the Orca Network, an advocacy group in Washington state and a researcher who participated in the making of Blackfish, told The Sentinel.

Despite its high-profile PR response, Atchison insisted that Blackfish and the negative publicity it has spawned has not hurt SeaWorld's business.

The company says it is on track to post core earnings of almost $440 million on sales of nearly $1.5 billion, both of which would be company records.

'As much data as we have and as much as we look, I can't connect anything really between the attention that the film has gotten and any effect on our business,' he said.

Blackfish grossed only about $2.1 million during limited theatrical, but has repeatedly aired on CNN and this week debuted on Netflix.

A representative for Blackfish distributor Magnolia Pictures said Thursday that the film's performance on Apple's iTunes and video-on-demand channels has been 'through the roof', though the company would not provide figures.

Netflix also would not disclose viewership data for the film.

Blackfish director Gabriela Cowperthwaite, who says she wasn’t a marine mammal activist before making the film, calls the news encouraging.

'If you tell people the truth, they’ll change the way they do things,' she said.

'They’ll make powerful and dignified decisions.'

Blackfish writer-director Gabriela Cowperthwaite, who admits to not being a marine expert before making the film and rather just a worried SeaWorld patron, says the backlash her movie has caused is 'encouraging'
