King James: Both Madrid dailies lead with the impending transfer for James Rodriguez to Real

AS are confident Rodriguez will be a hit, saying, James is ready. They insist the forward already has a place reserved for himself at Real's Valdebebas training ground.

Both papers report that Rodriguez has to meet up with Monaco on Monday, but this will probably be to say his goodbyes.

The formalities of the move will be sorted out when Angel Di Maria leaves the Bernabeu, claims AS.

One player who has already left Real is Alvaro Morata, with the forward heading for Juventus. Marca say Madrid will carry on 'without a No 9', while their former striker Ronaldo has congratulated them on signing 'the best player from the World Cup,' Toni Kroos.

Across the Spanish capital, AS report that champions Atletico are looking to add a big signing ahead of their pre-season tour.

The names the paper have thrown into the mix are Italy forward Alessio Cerci, of Torino, and Benfica midfielder Nicolas Gaitan.

Both papers have pictures of new Barcelona coach Luis Enrique and goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen at training.

Sport leads with a battle between Bayern Munich and Barca for Colombia's attacking midfielder Juan Cuadrado, with Fiorentina wanting €42million.

Star in stripes: The Italian dailies are full of the transfer of Roberto Pereyra from Udinese to Juventus

However, if he does stick with the Italian champions, he says he will 'give it my all'.

La Gazzetta dello Sport also have a piece hailing Nemanja Vidic, describing the former United captain as Inter Milan's 'totem' in defence.
