Lewis Hamilton believes more maturity and a better work ethic set him apart from the man he was when he last tasted Formula One title success.

The 29-year-old heads into the Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka this weekend with a slender three-point lead over Mercedes team-mate and title rival Nico Rosberg.

It is the closest Hamilton has come to adding to his 2008 drivers' championship crown, which he won at McLaren in his second season in F1.

A perceived gung-ho style has sometimes yielded great results or silly mistakes from the championship leader, but he believes he has moved away from relying solely on his instinct and now understands what is needed to repeat his success of six years ago.

'I'm older, and I feel it!,' he replied when asked what the major differences were between then and now.

'Back then it was all instinct, I think my maturity was at a very early stage and I probably think that is the biggest change and hopefully I will keep getting more and more mature.

'Also my work ethic. My work ethic is a lot better, more serious and more understanding - it seems to be working well for me.

'This has been the most consistent and best-performing season I have had in Formula One and I want to continue that for many, many years - it is like building blocks, I just need to keep working on it.

'You don't focus on the past but you don't forget about it. Ultimately what has happened in the past has defined today - it has shaped me personally, mentally and psychically into who I am today.

'Particularly this year, those experiences I have had I know this weekend will be a tough weekend, the next five could all be tough weekends, there is all the possibilities in the world I could be facing the toughest time of my life - but it is also possible it could be the greatest time of my life.'

Victory in Singapore a fortnight ago, coupled with the retirement of Rosberg, saw Hamilton nudge back ahead in their back-and-forth fight for the title.

But Hamilton does not expect the German to be dwelling on his disappointment and has backed him to come out fighting in Suzuka.

'Nico is such a strong competitor,' he said. 'Always, since we were young kids, he has been so strong mentality and confident and sure of his abilities.

'He has shown time and time again his pace and speed but he has also shown how he overcomes things quickly.

'He handled the last race with dignity, it felt that he had moved on very quickly and I anticipate he will be coming here stronger than ever and I need to be ready for that.'

Rosberg used the old adage that time is a great healer as he looks to regain the advantage in the title run-in.

'It is one of those moments and time is the best cure for such things,' he said of his Singapore retirement.

'It's been two weeks, which is plenty of time in the racing world. I'm here, I'm just as excited and optimistic as I was in Singapore. I've never come to Suzuka before in the most dominant car, so that's a great feeling.'

Rosberg has now been forced to retire from two races this season, with Hamilton suffering the same fate on three occasions - but both have also been forced to nurse problems to the end of some grands prix.

But, with Hamilton calling for improved reliability to give the drivers a 'straight battle' at the championship, Rosberg insists he is not losing any sleep over technical issues.

'I'm not worrying about reliability,' he said. 'I have this inner trust that the team is going to get the job done. I'm very confident.

'I'm not concerned, Even though it is a little weakness for us, in the big picture we have done an awesome job this year, so we mustn't now see this as a big problem for us as a team. It's a problem we have, but the big picture is absolutely spectacular.'

There remains a possibility Sunday's race may yet be cancelled if the approaching Typhoon Phanfone passes close enough to Suzuka.

In all likelihood any race that goes ahead will be affected by the rain and, although that would add another variable into the title mix, Rosberg is hoping for a wet race.

'The more rain the better - our car is so fast in the rain,' he added.

'I had pole at Spa the last time out when it was raining. The typhoon is very welcome!'
