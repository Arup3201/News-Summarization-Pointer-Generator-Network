Trendsetter: Pat Cash in 1987 scaling the roof of the Centre Court commentary box to celebrate with family

It has become one of Wimbledon’s more enduring images – champions scaling the roof of the Centre Court commentary box to celebrate with their watching family.

But now health and safety concerns have put paid to what began as an impromptu celebration of success.

All England Club officials have this year fitted a gate so instead of clambering on to the narrow ash felt roof and into the stands, players can walk up steps to the competitors’ box.

The move is expected to end to the practice started by Pat Cash in 1987 and followed by many subsequent champions including Andy Murray after his victory last year. Disgruntled fans quickly nicknamed the new addition to Centre Court ‘killjoy gate’ and ‘party-pooper gate’.

And Cash himself seemed disappointed, telling BBC Radio 5 live: ‘That’s really taking the challenge out of it. If they’re fit enough to win Wimbledon, I think they should climb up or have some other sort of challenge. It’s way too easy now.’

After his victorious match point in last year’s final, an emotional Murray clambered through the stands at the All England Club to embrace  two rows of Team Murray, including then coach Ivan Lendl.

Ironically, Cash started the tradition after defeating then world number one Lendl.

He has previously said that he ‘knew it’d be a first in pretty much any sport’ but his rebellious nature spurred him on.

He added: ‘I don’t think anybody knew what was going on as I ran over into the crowd … I got to the edge of the commentary box and I was worried that it might go crashing through – it was just a little booth with no proper roof … It held, thankfully.

‘I gave everyone in the team area a hug – Princess Diana and the royals were in the box next door, but I quickly decided against continuing my climb.’

British tennis star Andy Murray also climbed to see his family when he won the Wimbledon title last year

It became a Wimbledon tradition that has been followed by many other champions at other Grand Slam events. However, not all have rushed to the stands.

Seven times winner Roger Federer has always shunned the tradition because he believes it is unfair to leave the runner-up alone on the court. Serbian player Novak Djokovic, who celebrated his first Wimbledon title in 2011 by eating the grass, said climbing up to the players’ box was an important tradition.

He said: ‘I can’t say it’s wrong for the players to go straight to their box after they win the match because I understand the need to share this beautiful moment and victory with your closest ones.’

Other names proposed for the gate on Twitter included ‘Jobsworth Gate’ and ‘Health and Safety Gets Out of Hand Gate’. Though one suggested the more poetic ‘The Gate Of Hugs’.

A Wimbledon spokesman said: ‘It’s just to make it easier for them. It’s safe. It was installed in time for this year’s Championships to make it easier for players to access their team.’
