There's not much ex-Marine, natural historian and presenter Monty Halls won't do in the name of adventure.

'At one point I was sleeping in a coffin-shaped, scorpion-filled cavity 500 feet up a limestone cliff face,' he tells Mail Online Travel. 

His new series, Lost Worlds, charts his escapades  with explorer, survival expert and pioneering climber Leo Houlding to some of the world's furthest flung corners.

The pair travelled deep into to the rainforests of Guyana and the Mulu caves in Borneo. Their aim? To seek out places mankind has never set food, to find out if the age of exploration is really over.

In two sneak preview videos, we see the pair gearing up to sleep 500 feet above the ground in hammocks hoisted up into the canopy of the Amazon rainforest. 

'I was so far out of my comfort zone,' says Halls, a marine biologist. 'I love sea level and below, so it was nerve-racking for me.'

'But I was in safe hands. Leo is one of the best climbers in the world.' 

The adventurers spent the night sleeping on a tiny platform 500ft above the Amazon rainforest, which Halls admits took him right out of his comfort zone - and forced him to retreat into a cave

The two explorers were flown straight in to the remote jungle in Guyana, and even tried to scale a vertical rockface by a waterfall

The duo also over-nighted on a ledge the size of a kitchen table half way up the Melinau gorge, in Borneo, which was particularly challenging for Halls, who suffers from vertigo. 

'Leo is fine with heights, so he slept on his hammock over the cliff edge, while I crawled into a tiny coffin-shaped cave.

'Once I got in, I noticed lots of little burrows all around me, so I decided to have a look with my endoscope. There were scorpions all around me.'

'I didn't sleep well that night, and I woke up to something crawling over my face.' 

Monty Halls, right, was joined by Leo Houlding, left, one of the world's best climbers, having scaled the notorious El Capitan in California, at 18

He describes the adventure as an exercise in fear management - arachnophobia, claustrophobia, vertigo. You name it, they did it.

Hall continues: 'We had once incident where one of the porters cut his foot with a machete. We were out in the middle of nowhere, and our medic had to strap him up.

'He could have lost a lot of blood, so he had to be carried out of the rainforest and helicoptered to safety.  

'You are always tip-toeing on the edge of calamity with these things.'

The pair took a two-day trek to the Mulu caves in Borneo.  

Halls says if they had lost their guides in the endless underground maze of caves, they'd have never got out. 

The daring pair encountered a huge variety of wildlife from the seemingly harmless to the utterly terrifying

'The floor was a jumble of boulders and crags and ravines. We were squeezing through tiny little gaps. We fell over a lot, if we had broken a leg or something it would have taken weeks to get you out. We were squeezing through tiny little gaps. More people have stood on the moon than have been here.'

No wonder the star refers to it as 'the most adventurous serious I've ever made'.

The idea behind the series was to see if genuine exploration still exists. Are there still areas of the world so remote that just a handful of people can reach them?

Throughout 2014 Houlding and Halls put t to the test, making extraordinary expeditions in South America and Borneo where they discovered new species, found legendary geographic features, and became the first people to measure two supposedly mythical waterfalls.

The two also descended into the Mulu caves in Borneo, one of the longest networks of caves in the world

Even descending into complete darkness, in areas where so few humans have stepped, the duo came across wildlife

The duo teamed up to combine Houlding' remarkable climbing ability with Halls’ past as a Royal Marine Commando and his present role as a biologist.

They managed to ascend a new route up the 1,000ft Melanau Gorge, as well as pushing deep into the Mulu Cave System, pushing themselves to the limit.

So, having reached parts of the world barely touched before and even discovered new species, is there still more to see?

Halls explains: 'The world has many places left to explore. We've explored 5 per cent of the deep sea. Man knows nothing about it.And only 30 per cent of our cave systems  have been explored.' 

Lost Worlds with Monty Halls and Leo Houlding airs for four weeks from Friday February 13 at 9pm on the Discovery Channel.
