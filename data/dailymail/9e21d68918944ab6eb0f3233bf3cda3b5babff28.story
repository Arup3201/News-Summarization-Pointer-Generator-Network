For most parents a set of Lego, a solid climbing frame and well-stocked bookcase would be considered a satisfactory selection of facilities at their child's nursery, but for parents in London's Clapham, it's more than their child's developmental needs that are being met.

At the newly opened Clapham Village Nursery, you can drop off your laundry alongside your child in the morning and pick it up ready folded when you come to fetch an expertly-stimulated and (presumably perfectly laundered) child at the end of the day. 

And there's no stressing about what to make for supper. The nursery will also provide a freshly-cooked meal for the whole family, complete with starter and pudding.

A new nursery in Clapham aims to take the stress out of the day for working mums by offering gym classes, laundry services and take-away family suppers

What more could you ask for? How about a choice of yoga, Pilates or boxercise classes so you don't have to rush off to the gym, a selection of tea, coffee and pastries to send you off on your morning commute and IT facilities including computers, ipads and printers at your fingertips?

It's all provided at The Village - for a little extra cost, of course. On top of the £80 day rate for children, the adult supplement costs £100 a month, which buys you as many pastries as you can eat, free use of the IT facilities in the 'parent hubb' and four vouchers for the laundry, meal or exercise services.

Of course, your children won't do badly either. The nursery has an outdoor beach and tree-house, a fully-equipped mini kitchen and art studio.

'We had a number of meetings with local parents before opening to find out how we could make their life easier and these were some of the aspects that were mentioned,' explains the nursery's manager Malcolm Vickery to the MailOnline.

'Parents feel they're constantly going backwards and forwards so we're trying to reduce their need to rush about,' he adds.

Considering that a recent study found that the school or nursery drop-off and cooking dinner for the family were the two most stressful parts of the day, perhaps The Village is onto something. The survey, which was commissioned to mark October's Walk to School Month also found that 83 per cent of parents 'can't cope' juggling drop-offs with getting to work on time.

So a little help with the chores, which are often squeezed in before and after drop-off, would no doubt de-stress the day for many a working working mother.

But it's not always that simple its it? What about the parents who can't afford to spend £25 a pop on laundering their dirty underpants? Anand
 Shukla, Chief Executive of Family and Childcare Trust says more needs to be done for families who aren't on a posh budget.

'Far too 
many parents are unable to access childcare that meets their needs,' Shukla tells the MailOnline.

'Where childcare is available, it 
is often at a high cost to parents, with parents in Britain paying a 
higher proportion of their salary on childcare than all other European 
countries except Switzerland.

'Bold 
reforms are needed if we are going to achieve high quality childcare that is 
affordable and truly meets the needs of modern families,' he adds.

Pilates for stressed parents may not be top of the government's proprieties but nurseries that provide auxiliary services for working mothers and reforms that provide more flexibility in the work place could be. 

But downward dogs and puff pastries aside could ideas like The 
Village's 'parent hub' concept also tackle what has been dubbed the 'ghost children' phenomena. Earlier this year the
 Association of Teachers and Lecturers Earlier warned that a generation of 
children as young as four are stuck in a nursery or school environment for up to ten hours a day without parental touch.

Vickery hopes the nursery can go someway 
to help parents spend more time with their children. 'The idea is that 
parents can tap in and tap out of work all on our premises. Freelancers 
use the IT suite as their office and quite often parents who work in an 
office use it for conference calls that have to be scheduled at times 
that coincide with pick up or drop off, which means they can leave the 
office earlier,' he explains.

However the nursery does not encourage 
parents to make their presence known once they've kissed their little 
ones goodbye as it can be 'unsettling for the child'. But Vickery says 
the extra facilities mean parents who freelance or work from home can 
use the nursery as their office, cutting out journey times and 
shortening the hours away from their child.

Educational psychologist Hannah Abrahams believes parental presence in the nursery could be beneficial for the children in many ways.

'Anything that encourages parents and carers to work in collaboration and helps communication between the two is good for the children,' she says.

The nursery is hoping to cater to parents' needs as well as children's

'Creating that link between home and nursery can be very useful in managing any difficulties a child might be facing and sharing experiences between parents and carers can have positive affects on their development,' she adds.

'I can also see the appeal for parents. It could feel quite comforting knowing your child is just downstairs - especially if they are young.'

But Abrahams agrees that knowing parents are working upstairs could be unsettling for the children.

'It depends on the child, but it could make it harder for children to settle knowing their parents are right there. Part of the experience for children is learning to separate from a parent and understanding that when they say goodbye to you in the morning, you will still come back to collect them at the end of the day.'
