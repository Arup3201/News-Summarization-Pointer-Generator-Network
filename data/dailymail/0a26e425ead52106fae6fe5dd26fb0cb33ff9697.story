A man who was driving while disqualified killed a motorcyclist when he smashed into him before jumping into the passenger seat so his girlfriend could take the blame.

Father-of-one Alan Hellyer, 55, died instantly when his motorbike was hit by a car driven by Trevor Barnard, 33, on the A3 near Waterlooville in Hampshire.

Barnard and his lover Cassie Fagan, 24, told police she had been at the wheel and kept up their lives for eight months until Fagan finally cracked and confessed to police.

Trevor Barnard, 33, and girlfriend Cassie Fagan, 24, from Havant, lied to police about who had been driving

Today both were jailed after Fagan admitted perverting the course of justice and Barnard admitted driving while disqualified, perverting the course of justice, causing death by careless driving and driving without insurance.

Winchester Crown Court heard how Mr Hellyer, a keen golfer and fisherman from Havant, Hampshire, was returning home from visiting his mother in hospital when he was hit by the hired Vauxhall Astra, suffering severe head injuries.

Barnard, who was driving, swapped seats with Fagan at the scene because she had a clean licence and both claimed the rear light on Mr Hellyer’s motorbike was faulty.

Fagan told police she was behind the 
wheel and said the pair, who were also both from Havant, had been out shoplifting when the crash 
happened in September 2011, near Queen Elizabeth Country Park.

She was arrested and later charged with causing death by careless driving.  But Fagan contacted police in May last year and changed her story, admitting Barnard was in fact the driver.

He was charged after police investigated the claim and discovered that he had been driving while disqualified and without insurance.

He has now been jailed for four years and given a three-year driving ban, while Fagan was sentenced to a year in jail for her role in the deception.

Prosecutor Katherine Lumsdon described Mr Hellyer as 'an experienced and careful motorcyclist'.

Mr Hellyer’s brother Adrian, 54, said: 'We all think the sentences should have been a lot more.

'It’s not enough but at least it’s something.

'We didn’t get a chance even to say goodbye to him. We got nearly a year into the case to be told Barnard wasn’t the driver.

'Every day I pass over the spot where he was killed going to work and I think of him.'

He added: 'I feel at last we have got closure. We know who is responsible and they are paying the penalty.'

Mr Hellyer’s ex-wife, Linda Knipe, said: 'Alan was an extremely careful and considerate driver.

'I don’t feel we have been able to put Alan to rest until now.

'Two years is a long time. It’s because of them, because they lied.  Alan was wonderful and would do anything for anyone. He was an amazing dad.'

The web of lies told by Barnard and Fagan meant their cases were dragged out for more than two years following Mr Hellyer’s death.

Scene: The fatal accident happened on the A3 near Waterlooville in Hampshire in September 2011

In a statement read out in court, Fagan apologised to Mr Hellyer’s family for her actions.

Speaking after the case, investigating officer PC Karen Stevenson said: 'What Barnard and Fagan have put the family through is appalling.

'Hopefully now they can have some sort of closure.

'To have had the investigation go on that long because of the defendants’ action has had a terrible effect on the family.'

If you are caught driving whilst disqualified it should be an automatic 5 year prison sentence. Disgusting waste of oxygen, and she's no better for covering up for so long!

What a well thought out idea. Why not the death penalty for speeding while we are at it. All that your ill thought out idea would do is prevent ANYONE pulling over or stopping for any offense if it applied to them. Killing more people in car chases. Nobody stops if it means 5 years in jail. 

It is lucky that laws are generally considered from all angles and not reactionaries.

Surely the prison sentence and the ban should be appealed as being unduly lenient.

Has there not been a precedent for this sort of thing, set by a Member of Parliament in recent times, re. swapping  places in the car?

The sentence does not reflect the crime.  Why only 12 months ban?
