Terry Collins has been jailed for 16 years for two terrifying sex attacks

A taxi driver rapist who lured young women into his cab by decking it out with disco lights and sweets was today jailed for 16 years for two terrifying sex attacks.

Terry Collins, 61, who was known as the ‘Disco Cabbie’, was told by a judge that he remained a danger to women for as long as he was sexually active.

The predator cruised the streets at night looking to entice potential victims into his brightly-lit ‘honey trap’ taxi.

The pervert took photos of female passengers in drunken and inappropriately-dressed states using a dashboard camera.

In March 2010 he raped a girl of 14 after making her get into his taxi before forcing himself upon her.

Two years later he raped a 20-year-old woman reveller after she got into his Citroen Picasso cab at a rank at the end of a night out.

Police fear Collins has attacked other women customers in the past but they have never come forward.

Fellow cabbies spent three years raising their concerns to the licensing authority about the predator’s suspicious behaviour and his oddly-decorated taxi.

Their fears were raised further when he posted a number of his photos of female fares on his Facebook page in June 2011.

Officials ordered him to strip out the camera and the disco and strobe lights as well as a collection of soft toys and lollipops, but he kept them up.

He went on to attack his second victim after he opened the front passenger door as she staggered towards a taxi rank in Bournemouth, Dorset, during the early hours of March 10 last year.

As he drove along, with his eyes on the road, he indecently touched the shocked woman. He then pulled into some darkened garages where he forced her to perform a sex act on him and raped her.

Police arrested bespectacled Collins and quickly linked him to the 2010 attack on the 14-year-old.

He denied two charges of rape and one count of sexual assault makin his two victims go through the ordeal of giving evidence in front of a jury.

Grey-haired Collins was found guilty and was today jailed for 16 years.

Jailing him at Bournemouth Crown Court, judge Peter Johnson said: 'There is not one shred of remorse whatsoever that emanates from you.

'You are a callous and intelligent man who knew exactly what he was doing and one that enjoys control over women.

'You exercised no self-constraint and when asked to stop you carried on.

'You represent a danger to females while you remain sexually active.'

Detective Constable James Lees, of Bournemouth police, said afterwards: 'Collins abused the position of trust that he held as a taxi driver and preyed on vulnerable woman.

'There may be more of Collins’ victims yet to speak with police. If they have any concerns about Collins I urge them to contact the police as soon as possible.'

Collins’ second victim, a mother-of-one, told of her ordeal.

The woman, now aged 21, said: 'I left a karaoke bar in the early hours of the morning and walked to a nearby taxi rank.

'What happened is all a bit blurry but the front passenger door of a taxi was open and ready for me and I just got in.

'We were driving for a little while when he touched me inappropriately. He put his hand down my shorts without taking his eyes off the road. I didn’t say anything to him, I just froze.

'He pulled up to the garages behind my flat and touched me again even though I said "no" over and over again.

'I just went numb and and was just thinking about getting out of there alive. All I could think about was my child.

'It lasted about half-an-hour and afterwards I threw a £20 note at him and got out of the car and phoned the police.'

The woman said the attack had had a devastating effect on her.

She said: 'I couldn’t leave my home for about two weeks and lost two stone in weight. It took a few months for me to even be able to get back in a taxi again.'

John Tye, chairman of the Bournemouth Taxi Trades Association, said that licensing officials at Bournemouth council had questions to ask about allowing Collins to remain on the streets for so long.

He said: 'Collins was allowed to operate a taxi decked out in such a way to attract young and vulnerable girls.

'Within his car there were extensive disco-type fairy lights and countless cuddly toys right across the dashboard together with a container of sweet lollipops.

'The Trade presented totally unsuitable images of women that were downloaded from his Facebook profile to the licensing board.

'The question has to be asked that had the vehicle not been so high profile and a honey trap, would his victims have been drawn to it?'

Collins, from Bournemouth, held a private hire licence for 10 years but also acted as a rogue Hackney carriage, illegally picking up punters on the street.

He worked for Star Radio Cars in Bournemouth. A spokesman for the firm said: 'We followed all of the correct procedures and he was suspended as soon as we were notified (of his arrest). Our sympathies go out to all those involved.'
