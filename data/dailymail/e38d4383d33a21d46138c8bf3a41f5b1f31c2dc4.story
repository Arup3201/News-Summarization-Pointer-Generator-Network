Police have launched an investigation after a 15-year-old ‘child bride’ featured on Benefits Street.

Neither producers nor Channel 4 contacted police or social services, despite filming the girl’s Romanian husband Stefan Stana admitting that he had flouted British law.

He admitted on camera: ‘My wife is 15 and a half and I am 20. This scares people in England because she is a minor.’

'This scares people': Stefan and Madalina on the second episode of Channel 4's Benefits Street

Only a few months later,  the teenager, thought to be called Madalina Balasa,  gave birth to a baby girl in a Birmingham hospital.

Campaigners accused Channel 4 of turning a blind eye to underage marriage. But a spokesman for the broadcaster said: ‘There was no evidence of coercion or exploitation and the relationship appeared entirely genuine.

'The husband was clearly aware that there are differences in the law between countries and this was made clear in the programme.’

He added that informing the authorities would have compromised the trust the couple placed in documentary-makers Love Productions that allowed them to speak ‘openly, candidly and in confidence’.

But Birmingham Council criticised the broadcaster for putting their programme ahead of the welfare of Madalina, who married Stefan in Romania.

Investigation: Officers are 'keen to speak to' the couple, who no longer live on James Turner Street

‘We would urge anyone who is aware of someone in a similar situation to contact the police or social services,’ said a spokesman.

‘Indeed, we would have expected the film company  to have done this.’

The NSPCC, Action for Children, Birmingham Liberal Democrat MP John Hemming and the Children’s Commissioner for England also expressed concerns. 

Police said: ‘We are investigating along with Birmingham Social Services.’

The couple no longer live in the street so officers are ‘keen to speak to her’ or anyone who knows her whereabouts.
