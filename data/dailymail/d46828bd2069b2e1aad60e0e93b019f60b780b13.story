A mother who gave birth on a Manhattan sidewalk was all smiles as she returned to her apartment with the bundle of joy she named after a Good Samaritan who helped her.

Polly McCourt arrived back at her Upper East Side home with husband Cian and their newborn daughter Ila Isabelle two days after she had dramatically given birth on a busy street corner after an impatient woman had stolen her cab to the hospital.

Isabel Williams, 20, who kindly lent Mrs McCourt her coat to keep the baby warm explained that she just reacted instinctively.

She told The New York Daily News: ‘You just do what you have to do, you know?’

Ms
 Williams said that she saw a commotion on Monday afternoon on the 
corner of 68th street and 3rd Avenue and initially thought someone had 
been run over.

When she reached the crowd she quickly dialled 911 when it transpired that no one had called an ambulance.

She
 said that at that point the baby had been born and while Mrs McCourt 
had been given sweaters and scarves to keep warm, the baby was still 
exposed, so she offered her own coat, as well as a sweater and shirt.

The experience was ‘intense, but really cool’, she added.

The
 McCourts lost Ms Williams’ phone number so weren’t able to tell her in 
person about the baby’s name, but the news thrilled her.

Mrs
 McCourt was being helped to a taxi by her doorman, Anton Rudovic, and 
gave him a huge hug as she arrived home, The New York Daily News 
reported.

Mr Rudovic had 
been helping Mrs McCourt, 39, hail a taxi at around 4pm on Monday, but a
 woman jumped in front of her and stole the cab that pulled over.

Mrs
 McCourt, who is originally from Oxfordshire in the UK, said: 'He [the 
doorman] was trying desperately to hail a cab and a lady walked out five
 meters in front of him and hailed a cab and got into it.

'And I went ''that's my cab, I want that cab!'''

With
 the baby's head already crowning, Mrs McCourt gave up trying to get to 
nearby Lenox Hill Hospital and sat down on the sidewalk.  

With
 doorman Mr Rudovic supporting her back and female bystanders holding 
the baby's head, the newborn arrived in under five minutes. People 
rushed to give their scarves and coats to wrap the baby as the 
temperature was in the chilly mid-30s.

Mrs
 McCourt's husband Cian McCourt, 40, who was stuck in traffic, told 
MailOnline today that he feared the worst when he came running up and 
saw his wife on the ground.

Mr
 McCourt, a partner at A&L Goodbody law firm, said: 'It was a 
complete shock. I came running up the street and I immediately knew it 
was my wife.

'I saw the crowd and I feared the worst, that she had been knocked down or something - it was really emotional.

'Then I saw the baby already in her arms. She was covered in scarves, shirts and coats, the people who helped were great.'

Mr McCourt said that his wife and new daughter, who weighs around 7lb, 'were doing great'.

Mr McCourt, who is originally from Dublin in Ireland, said they wanted to get in touch with a woman named Isabelle.

They were so grateful for her kind gesture of giving up her coat that they named their baby after her.

Mrs McCourt said: 'She was meant to be Ila Polly... but now she's Ila Isabelle. We're very happy with it.'

The couple also have a son Conor, six, and a four-year-old daughter Adele.

Mr
 McCourt said today that his son was aware of his new sister's dramatic 
arrival but was 'very blasé' about the whole 
thing.
