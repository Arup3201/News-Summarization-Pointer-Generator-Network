Tulsa police say 14-year-old April Montano was killed early Friday when the teen was shot in the head in a drive-by shooting on the Gilcrease Expressway.

Montano was in a pickup truck pulling a trailer full of all-terrain vehicles when a black car pulled alongside her vehicle and gunfire erupted.

She was pronounced dead at Saint Francis Hospital at 2:38 a.m.

14-year-old April Montano was killed early Friday when the teen was shot in the head in a drive-by shooting

Montano's family was heading home at the time of the shooting, and several other passengers were in the pickup with her including children.

No one else was injured.

The driver, who has yet to be identified, pulled the truck off the road at first believing only the ATV's had been hit in the shooting.

Police said there was no evidence the family 'had any issue or problem with anyone encountered in the other vehicle.'

Road rage, a common cause of many shootings, has been ruled out as a factor.

'We don’t know whether the shooter wanted whatever the family was hauling or something else,' Sgt. Dave Walker said.

Police said they have yet to determine a motive for the shooting or make any arrests in the case

No arrests have yet been made in connection with the shooting.

Montano graduated from Thoreau Demonstration Academy's eighth grade just two days before her death.

'We are deeply saddened 
by the loss of April Montano,' wrote Tulsa Public Schools Superintendent Keith
 Ballard. 'April’s teachers tell me she was an 
absolute delight in the classroom and she was a pleasure to teach.

'On behalf of the 
students and staff at Thoreau and everyone at Tulsa Public Schools, we 
would like to express our most sincere sympathy to April’s family and 
classmates. We are so sorry to hear of her tragic passing.'

Montano, who had graduated eighth grade only days before, was killed by a single gunshot to the head

One of Montano's friends, Ruth Fernandez, said she was shocked by the tragedy.

'There is no easy way to cope with losing a friend,' Fernandez told Tulsa World. 'She was always happy. She was always there for you.'
