Not understanding a partner's needs, money and patience are the issues Australian couples fight about the most, according to a new study.

The research was conducted by online dating site, eHarmony, and also found compromise - not make-up sex - was the most effective way to resolve an issue in a relationship.

Almost two-thirds of couples surveyed said they believed not understanding their partner's needs put more strain on their relationship than any other issue.

Not understanding a partner's needs, money and patience are the issues couples fight about the most, according to a new study

Almost two-thirds of couples surveyed said they believed not understanding their partner's needs put more strain on their relationship than any other issue

While financial issues came in at second place on 57 per cent, not being patient with each other followed on 51 per cent.

But eHarmony dating and relationship expert Melanie Schilling said there were underlying reasons as to why these problems kept coming up.

'Money fights, for example, are rarely ever actually about money,' Ms Schilling said.

'There's usually an underlying factor that fuels it, around something that matters more like fear of not having influence over important issues that could impact the relationship.'

Married couple Fiona Caddies and Bjorn Miller told Daily Mail Australia the key to maintaining their relationship was communicating each other's needs

The research also found certain age groups were more likely to fight about particular issues.

More Australians between the ages of 35 and 49 quarrelled over financial problems while those from 18 to 24 and 25 to 34 were more likely to clash over not understanding their partner's needs.

Ms Schilling said it was also great to see couples were using a more holistic approach to resolving conflicts rather than having make-up sex.

More than 60 per cent of Australians are using the conciliation method - a process of compromise - to resolve an argument, while 55 per cent followed a cooperation method, which is a win-win solution. 

'While this [sex] may be effective in the short term, it doesn't allow for the chance to actually discuss and resolve the issue,' Ms Schilling said.

'When handled correctly, conflict can actually be an opportunity for learning, growth and positive change.' 

The study also found men and women had different views of what causes conflict to arise.

Women believe a clash of morals and beliefs, a lack of compromise, and a build-up of small issues were more likely to cause an argument than men. 

Married couple Fiona Caddies and Bjorn Miller - who spent two years living apart and met through eHarmony - told Daily Mail Australia the key to maintaining their relationship was communicating each other's needs.

She said they used a shared calendar to tell each other which appointments and events were most important to attend so their partner would know what to prioritise.

'We probably learned more about each other because we had to organise our lives through shared calendars,' Ms Caddies said.

'The shared calendar was colour-coded so we knew what was important, so we knew what each other's doing.'
