The last of the six Britons arrested by Russian authorities during a Greenpeace protest in the Arctic has been freed

Philip Ball from Oxford was granted bail last week but remained in detention before being released by a court in St Petersburg today.

Only one of the 30 people arrested by the Russian authorities two months ago - Australian Colin Russell - remains in detention.

Relief: Mr Ball's brother, Steve, said they are thrilled he can now talk to his family and friends after two months

Greenpeace's Arctic Sunrise was seized by the Russian authorities, who arrested the 28 activists and two freelance journalists on board.

The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, sitting in Hamburg, has ruled that the ship and those arrested should be released in return for a 3.6 million euro (£3 million) bond.

The five Britons previously released were Anthony Perrett, from Newport in south Wales, freelance journalist Kieron Bryan, Alexandra Harris from Exeter, Iain Rogers from Devon, and Frank Hewetson from London.

Mr Ball's brother, Steve, said: 'It's absolutely brilliant news. After two months in jail he could have done without another weekend behind bars, but it's a great relief to know he's finally out and able to talk to his friends and colleagues.

'Our thoughts though are still with Colin's family. It's great to see people from the four corners of the world calling for his immediate release and I do hope he'll be able to join the other 29 soon.'

Ben Ayliffe, of Greenpeace 
International, said: 'This is news we've been waiting for all weekend, 
but of course our hearts and thoughts remain with Colin Russell and his 
family.

'Since being 
reunited after their release, our friends in St Petersburg have swapped 
stories, tears and experiences, hugged friends and each other and told 
of their great resolve and commitment to defending the Arctic against 
oil drilling and climate change.

'This is not over yet and none of us 
will be truly happy until all of the Arctic 30 have been released from 
detention and the charges against them dropped.'

Greenpeace
 said it was not yet certain whether the released non-Russian nationals 
can leave Russia and return home, while lawyers for Mr Russell are 
lodging appeals against his continued detention and expect a hearing to 
be held this week.

Speaking 
to Australian media, Colin's wife, Christine - who plans to travel to St
 Petersburg with the couple's daughter, Madeleine, this week - has 
appealed to Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott to do more to help 
secure her husband's release.

She
 said: 'I just think Colin would be so ashamed at the thought that our 
prime minister and foreign affairs minister have not been able to take 
five minutes... and pick up the phone and make direct representations.'

The
 tribunal last week ruled that 'the Russian Federation shall immediately
 release the vessel Arctic Sunrise and all persons who have been 
detained upon the posting of a bond or other financial security by the 
Netherlands'.

It also ordered Russia to allow the vessel and those detained to leave the country.

After their release last week, Mr Bryan and Ms Harris told how tough 
it had been when they were locked up after the Greenpeace vessel Arctic 
Sunrise was boarded by Russian security forces during a protest against 
oil drilling.

Ms Harris revealed she was kept in a cell on her own after being taken to a prison in Murmansk.

'For the first week it was really harsh. It was nerve-wracking,' she told BBC News immediately after being released.

'I was in a cell on my own. You do get used to it, but it was tough.'

Ms Harris said letters from supporters had kept her going.

Mr
 Perrett is a tree surgeon and director of a community interest company 
which encourages and supports the use of renewable energy.

He said the Arctic was where the battle to save the planet will be fought.

Friends
 said he went to the Arctic driven by his belief that there are ways to 
live on this planet without destroying it. Before he left, he said he 
was nervous but not afraid of going on the trip.

The
 30 were arrested during a protest against drilling in the Arctic and 
were initially held in Murmansk before being moved to St Petersburg.

They were charged with piracy but the authorities said this would be changed to hooliganism.

Greenpeace said the 30 had done nothing wrong, and the group has launched a worldwide campaign to have them freed.
