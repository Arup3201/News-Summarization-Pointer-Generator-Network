The pretty old Belgian cloth town of Ypres is linked by a canal to the Channel, from which for centuries English wool was shipped inland for weaving.

On Thursday, it will provide the setting for an EU summit which could mark the beginning of a process whereby, within a few short years, Britain could feel obliged to quit Europe.

If Jean-Claude Juncker is anointed president of the European Commission, many voters in this country will start eyeing the exit.

The Cathedral and Cloth Hall in Ypres, Belgium, pictured in 1916, was reduced to rubble during the First World War

The Cloth Halls have been restored to their former glory in Ypres, Belgium, a hundred years after they were destroyed. In the same town this week, the EU is planning to hand its top job to an arch-federalist

Yet a century ago, around this same Ypres, millions of British soldiers fought to frustrate German dominance of Europe, and almost a quarter of a million died, including one of my own great-uncles.

It is a place etched deep into the heritage of Britain, a name that commands pride — because there the British Army defied repeated German offensives — and also horror, because of the cost.

One of my grandfathers and another of my great-uncles won Military Crosses there, and most families in Britain can claim similar associations.

Uncle Lewis was a poet, a post-war friend of Siegfried Sassoon. In 1930, he wrote a piece entitled The Salient, about Ypres in 1917, of which one verse ran:

When every hollow’s a belching mass

Of wrangling guns, guns bellowing to guns

You cannot tell a burst of ours from the Huns’

Suddenly through the cordite, I smelt the gas.

Down went the warning through the roar and screech

The spitting splinters ploughed us like a squall

Half-blinded gunners wrestled with the breech.

What would Lewis and the legion of his long-ago comrades have thought, I wonder, to see Ypres today, rebuilt from knee-high rubble into manicured prosperity, the scene of a summit of nations overwhelmingly dominated by mighty Germany?

They would surely welcome Angela Merkel’s country as an impeccable democracy, which has forsworn militarism to become one of the greatest manufacturers on Earth.

But they would wonder at the extraordinary reversal of history, whereby ‘Wipers’ threatens to go down in history as the place where the British commitment to the Continent — which began in 1914 — faces its nemesis.

Britain for most of its past sought to influence Europe at long range, without direct engagement on foreign soil. For most of the Napoleonic Wars, we fought the French mainly with our fleets and our gold, and only reluctantly committed an Army to the Continent.

After Wellington secured his triumph over Bonaparte on June 18, 1815, at Waterloo —barely an hour’s drive from Ypres — our soldiers went thankfully home. No British government wished to contemplate fighting again in Europe.

Thus, a hundred years later, the British Army, which had meanwhile fought Zulus and Dervishes and Russians and Afghans on far-flung fields, was bemused to find itself back in Belgium.

A Grenadier officer wrote after leading his men through Ypres for the first time in October 1914: ‘It seems so odd to be fighting in this sort of country — we have always associated war with the tropics.’

But fight furiously he and 150,000 of his comrades did, through October and November, to defeat the last huge German offensive, designed to win the war by Christmas.

Yet the price of victory was so high that no one felt minded to celebrate. Most of the British Expeditionary Force, the old sweats of the regular Army, repose for ever in cemeteries around Ypres.

During the four years that followed, an average of 5,000 British soldiers a month perished in the Salient, where they fought three more major battles that bear its name.

In addition to the dead, a million British men were wounded there. One of the most familiar sights of my childhood was that of some of them, wearing medals but with empty sleeves or trouser legs, playing chirpily melancholy music in city streets.

Many of those who had bled, or seen loved ones perish in World War I, felt deeply bitter when it proved necessary for their successor generation to do it all over again, to fill thousands more cemeteries, to defeat Germany a second time between 1939 and 1945.

After we had won all over again, it seemed that the only way forward for tired, broke, battered Britain was to throw in its lot with the Continent.

In pursuit of peace, we kept an Army on the Rhine for more than half a century, to play our part in deterring Russian aggression through the Cold War.

In pursuit of prosperity, in 1973 we joined the Common Market, a free trading association which, for a time, seemed to serve us well.

But Europe’s tragedy — and I use the word advisedly — is that its political elites have never been content with the notion of the Union as a medium of mercantile exchange.

They have pursued with dogged determination a vision of political and economic union which defies popular will, cultural identities, democratic principles and the merest common sense.

I say all this without pleasure, because I have never voted for  Ukip and never will. If it is humanly possible, I want us to stay in Europe — but not at any price.

If our partners, and especially the members of the Eurozone, are bent on advancing towards ever-closer union, then not only are the British people almost certain to reject such a course, but they seem entirely right to do so.

The EU leaders’ apparent determination to choose as their president the Luxembourger Jean-Claude Juncker, who is as notorious for fanatical federalism as for his unfitness to achieve much after liquid lunches, seems a sign no British citizen can fail to heed.

We often hear how eager the Germans are to keep Britain in Europe, to offer concessions to our desire for a repatriation of powers. But Merkel’s support for Juncker’s appointment makes plain the emptiness of such expressions of goodwill.

I have attended several European conferences, at which the obsessive commitment of the German political elite to pursue union, regardless of their own electorate’s opinions, has been wretchedly apparent.

A pitch by David Cameron, pictured talking with Jean-Claude Juncker, for a renegotiation of our EU membership if he wins next year¿s general election 'seems likely to get nowhere meaningful'

David Cameron’s pitch for a renegotiation of our EU membership if he wins next year’s general election seems likely to get nowhere meaningful.Sooner or later, the Eurozone will probably crash-land, with especially painful consequences for its southern European members, however many of their bills the Germans go on paying in order to enable them all to buy imported BMWs.

France’s future looks politically bleak and economically sterile. Even in the cause of we British being good Europeans — of the kind I have wanted to be for most of my adult life — it seems impossible to stay aboard a vessel committed to a doomed voyage.

I do not think our departure from Europe will bring sudden happiness to Britain, but Thursday’s meeting at Ypres seems almost certain to start us on that path, through no fault of Mr Cameron.

What a place to choose, to make decisions that presage the undoing of so many of our hopes for Britain in Europe.

My ancestors, and probably yours, too, would look upon the triumph of Jean-Claude Juncker with disbelief that the Germans could prove themselves so stupid as to want this foolish man, and Britain so small a place as to be unable to stop him.

On Thursday, the buglers who play the Last Post at the Menin Gate in Ypres may bid a symbolic farewell to more than the dead of a century ago.

The saga of Britain’s role in Europe, which began in blood a century ago, threatens to end in torrid farce.
