The family of the SeaWorld trainer who died in 2010 when an orca pulled her under the water have spoken for the first time about the controversial Blackfish documentary. 

Dawn Brancheau's family say the 40-year-old trainer would never have remained at the Orlando, Florida marine park if she believed the whales were treated badly.

The family distanced themselves from the critical documentary Blackfish, which alleged animal cruelty over captive orcas being kept at marine parks.

Statement: Dawn's husband, Scott Brancheau, center, her mother Marion Lovedre, and brother Charles, left, at a hearing about the trainer's death in 2010. The family have refused to back the critical Blackfish documentary

In a statement on the Dawn Brancheau Foundation website the trainer's family said they had been asked constantly for their opinion of the film since it was shown at the Sundance Film Festival last year. 

'First and foremost we are not 
affiliated with this movie in any way,' the statement, which was 
released earlier this week, said.

Critical: The documentary Blackfish claimed it was cruel to keep orcas in captivity

'Blackfish is not Dawn's story. Dawn Brancheau believed in the ethical treatment of animals. Dawn followed her dreams and became a marine animal trainer. She loved the whales and was proud of her work as a trainer,' it added.

'Dawn would not have remained a trainer at SeaWorld for 15 years if she felt that the whales were not well cared for.'

The family added that they continued to support Ms Brancheau's friends and colleagues who still work at SeaWorld.

The statement added: 'Since Dawn’s death nearly four years ago, the media has focused mainly on the whales.

'A human life was lost that day and it feels as though some believe her death was just a footnote.'

The family said they would not be releasing further statements about the film.

Ms Brancheau had wanted to work with orcas since she first saw the Shamu show when she was a little girl.

She worked hard to secure a job at the park and in 1996, the year she married a fellow worker at SeaWorld, she realized her ambition to work in Shamu stadium.

Since the documentary, several entertainers have pulled out of planned performances at the parks.

Ms Brancheau was grabbed and drowned by six-ton orca Tilikum after a show in February 2010. The documentary examined Tilikum's background and was critical of keeping whales in captivity.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration confirmed on Tuesday that it was looking into reports that Lara Padgett, who helped investigate Ms Brancheau's death, had fraternized with the makers of Blackfish at film festivals in the U.S.

'OSHA is committed to fair and effective enforcement of safety and health requirements in the workplace,' Jesse Lawder said in an email. 'Allegations involving employee conduct are taken seriously and OSHA is investigating.'
