Isolated, labelled as freaks and facing a life of begging and prostitution - meet India's transgender women who have been ostracised from their communities but cling to the dream of finding love.

In India, there are up to 1.2million transgender people, also known as hijras. Earlier this year, the country's first transgender mayor was elected and less than 12 months ago the Supreme Court granted legal recognition to the community as a third gender.

To an outsider, it might be assumed that these hijras - described as 'men minus maleness' - are able to lead peaceful lives without fear of discrimination, but this could not be further from the truth for some.

Isolated: In India, there are up to 1.2million transgender people, also known as hijras. They are ostracised from their communities

Change: Less than 12 months ago the Supreme Court granted legal recognition to the community as a third gender

Hijras live together in houses where a chief or godmother acts as leader. There are no men and they adopt a combination of Hindu and Muslim cultures

Hidden: Aside from going to work, hijras usually don't go out in public and most restaurants will not let them dine there

Her parents had high hopes for their first son, but from a young age Saranya was different from other little boys. 

Showing her femininity resulted in severe punishment and by the age of 16 she felt exhausted, suppressed and judged. 

Saranya fled her home in the western city of Pune and took refuge with her new transgender family in Bangalore in the south of the country. 

Hijras live together in houses where a chief or godmother acts as leader. There are no men and they adopt a combination of Hindu and Muslim cultures.  

They refer to each other as mothers, sisters, aunts, grandmothers and great-grandmothers.

When Saranya was accepted into her transgender family, she underwent her toughest challenge - her physical transformation.

The painful operation - known as Nivran, or rebirth - involves the removal of the penis and testicles and is carried out at home while the patient is awake.

Traditional: They have maintained a traditional Indian style, in contrast to many middle and upper class women who have cut their hair and wear western clothing

The hijras wear traditional Indian clothing and apply makeup in their transgender homes - which are often small, dark and damp

Religion: They adopt a combination of Hindu and Muslim cultures and  refer to each other as mothers, sisters, aunts, grandmothers and great-grandmothers

Prostitution: Many are encouraged to become prostitutes due to the financial benefits as well as beg in return for blessings

Now 58 years old, Saranya has lost contact with all but one member of her family - her sister.

Aside from going to work, hijras usually don't go out in public and most restaurants will not let them dine there.  

Instead, many prefer to stay within the safety of their transgender homes, giving each other companionship and dreaming of finding husbands.

Even if they do marry, some hijras do not live with their husbands - perhaps seeing them monthly or as little as once a year - and often the marriages have unhappy endings. 

For work, hijras traditionally beg and give blessings in return, as well as dance and entertain. Many are also encouraged to become prostitutes due to the financial benefits.

The rights of transgender people may be changing, but even the country's first mayor has admitted to being a former beggar

Beauty: They have maintained a traditional Indian style, in contrast to many middle and upper class women

Hijras often live in poverty - in damp, dark homes with no beds or furniture. Yet, there is an obsession with keeping them clean and neat. 

They have maintained a traditional Indian style by wearing saris and bindis, in contrast to many middle and upper class women who have cut their hair and wear western clothing. 

But Saranya's hands are covered in wounds and scars - each of which has its own painful story. 

One angry customer attacked her with a knife instead of paying, another scar is the result of abuse from two drunk men. 

Saranya's story may be painful but it is certainly not unique. The rights of transgender people may be changing, but it seems discrimination is still rife.

Even the country's first transgender mayor is a former beggar.

Friendship: They often prefer to stay within the safety of their transgender homes, giving each other companionship

Hijras are described as 'men minus maleness' and face a life of Isolation, begging and prostitution

New lifes: Some hijras flee their homes and find refuge with her new transgender families where they start new lives

Just months ago she was scratching out a living singing and dancing on trains for a few rupees from commuters.

But in January, Madhu Bai Kinnar began leading her community as India's first transgender mayor - a dramatic election result that upends cultural mores in the traditionally conservative country.

Kinnar won the election in Raigarh in the central state of Chhattisgarh, beating her rival from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) by more than 4,500 votes.

Television pictures showed the 35-year-old draped in a saree and with a large red bindi on her forehead, folding her hands and greeting supporters who placed marigold garlands around her neck amid strobing camera flashes.

Kinnar, a member of the Dalit caste previously known as the 'untouchables', put herself forward for election when she was asked to represent her community.

'People have shown faith in me. I consider this win as love and blessings of people for me. I’ll put in my best efforts to accomplish their dreams,' Kinnar said.

'It was the public support that encouraged me to enter the poll fray for the first time and because of their support only, I emerged as the winner.'

Kinnar's win comes nine months after India's top court ruled that transgenders be legally recognised as gender-neutral.

Often known as 'hijras' in South Asia, transgenders are classified as people who have had sex change operations or who regard themselves as the opposite of their born gender.

Activists say there are hundreds of thousands of transgender people in India, but because they were not legally recognised, they faced ostracism, discrimination, abuse and forced prostitution.
