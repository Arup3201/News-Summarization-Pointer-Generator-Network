For thousands of years, people have gazed at the night sky and found things they can relate to their lives on earth.

Where the ancient Greeks saw mythological characters in the stars though, today’s scientists have spotted something a little less glamorous.

Astronomers have discovered a molecular cloud, formations in space known as the nursery of an unborn star, which they say looks like a pig’s tail.

The giant 'pigs tail' cloud spotted 30,000 light years from earth

The Japanese research team found two giant molecular clouds 30,000 light years from our Solar System which they believe collided and formed the peculiar shape.

And, spotting the twist in its tail, they gave the gas cloud an equally peculiar name.

While the clouds often collide, few have been seen to do so with the spectacular consequences found by Shinji Matsumura, a second year Ph. D. candidate, and Tomoharu Oka, an Associate Professor, the research team from the Department of Physics at Keio University.

They said they believe a magnetic tube was formed between the two giant molecular clouds, which is 'twisted and squeezed to become a helical structure during the frictional contact'.

Their research suggested that the molecular gas is captured by the twisted magnetic tube, forming the distinctive 'pigtail' shape.

Researchers believe the galaxy was formed between the two giant molecular clouds, which is twisted and squeezed to become a helical structure.

Our Galaxy has a high quantity of the molecular gas which forms stars within a 600 light year radius from its centre.

Those clouds become increasingly dense and orbit the Galaxy’s nucleus.

At the distance that these two are found, there are two closed elliptical orbits clouds travel along and, at one of the two intersections, molecular clouds often collide.

The huge gas formations can eventually give birth to new stars as they become denser.

The gas is compressed even more when clouds collide with each other, meaning the strange shape observed by the scientists manning the NRO 45m Telescope at the Nobeyama Radio Observatory (NAOJ) in the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan – which measures around 60 light years by 60 light years - could one day become a star itself.

Mr Matsumura said: 'In order to solve the mystery of the pigtail molecular cloud, we carried out high-resolution spectroscopic observations of rotational spectral lines for six other molecules.

'Those molecules are clues to understanding the physical state.

'We were amazed by the clear and beautiful helical structure of the ‘pigtail’ molecular cloud in the data taken by the follow-up observation.

'The data revealed that the pigtail molecular cloud has a huge volume of gas, several hundreds of thousands times greater than the Sun has.'
