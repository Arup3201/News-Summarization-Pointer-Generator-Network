He once referred to himself as the 'Kanye West of food' and now Kim Kardashian's best friend Jonathan Cheban is set to open a 'fast casual' restaurant.

The Burger Bandit will open in Long Island, New York, 'any day now' and Cheban hopes to turn it into a global franchise.

He believes there is a gap in the market for his restaurant, which will have mini burgers on potato buns topped with a secret sauce, and toasted marshmallow milkshakes on the menu.

New venture: Jonathan Cheban with best pal Kim Kardashian will open The Burger Bandit this week

'There are places all over the world that are missing burger places,' Cheban told The Wall Street Journal.

He described his establishment as a 'fast casual' outlet, rather than a fast-food restaurant.

Explaining what this means, he said: 'You can sit down and you can take it to go. It's a cross between a Five Guys (American burger outlet) and a Shake Shack (trendy gourmet burger chain).'

Cheban's burgers are a little over two ounces - bigger than sliders but smaller than conventional burgers.

The burgers at Burger Bandit are a little over two ounces, bigger than sliders (pictured) but smaller than conventional burgers. The restaurant also plans to serve toasted marshmallow milkshakes 

'I can't stand eating sliders because they're often hard as a rock and they're dry,' Cheban explained. Meanwhile, he thinks 'a big burger is kind of a pain in the butt.'

So, he developed the bandit. 'It fits in your hand and you could have two or three,' he said. 'In one sitting, I can do about three.'

'But I don't like fancy burgers, or burgers that come with blue cheese and potato and a thousand things. I don't like them with 55 toppings,' he said. 'I like burgers how I like my pizza: plain and simple.'

His reality TV superstar pal Kardashian-West has said she's impressed by his new venture.

'I'm really proud of him,' she said at a recent event. 'I love it when people do entrepreneurial kinds of things.' 

This isn't the 40-year-old's first foray into the food and beverage industry.

A man of many talents: Cheban runs lifestyle website TheDishh.com 

'I am the Kanye West of food,' Cheban said to US Weekly. 'Everything is perfect and top notch. Nobody can match me with knowing about food. I'm the king of food, I eat out three to four meals a day.'

He also runs lifestyle website TheDishh.com.

Discussing TheDishh last September he told MailOnline: 'I felt this was the perfect time for me because I have such a huge following. I've got one million followers on Instagram and 555,000 on Twitter. Celebrities would come up to me and say, 'I can't stop following your food posts'.

'I wanted to make the site a little gossipy and dish the dirt, so The Dishh was born. 

'It's pretty fun, it's not bashing anyone. The Dishh has everything, not just gossip; cool places and cool outfits, cool places to travel, cool things to see and do.

'People know I know the hottest places to go and this is just a whole new move for me in expanding that. It's going to be super-hot; the best places, the best fashion, the best destinations.

'I haven't worked in an office for like seven years, but I'm here all day, every day. I can't get enough of it.'
