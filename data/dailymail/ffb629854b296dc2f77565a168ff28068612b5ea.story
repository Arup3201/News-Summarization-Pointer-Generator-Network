Five hundred not out as captain and John Terry celebrated with a new hairdo – slab of longer hair on the top and extra-short everywhere else - and a win at Crystal Palace which should erase some of the pain of his last visit.

At Selhurst Park in March, Terry scored the only goal of the game in the wrong net and Jose Mourinho conceded defeat in the title challenge and criticised his team for lacking 'balls'.

This trip across the capital was far more enjoyable for Chelsea as wonderful goals from Oscar and Cesc Fabregas set them up for a 2-1 win which extends their unbeaten start to the campaign as captain JT passed his impressive milestone, nearly 13 years after he first led the team out against Charlton, in December 2001.

After the game he posted a picture on his Instagram account of a bottle of Sassicaia and two glasses with the message: 'Today was my 500th game as Chelsea Captain, I had the pleasure of playing and learning from the best with Dennis Wise and Marcel Desailly two heroes and great captains who always had time for me as a young boy. A glass of SASSICAIA to celebrate. Thanks for your unbelievable support. JT'

Leadership: The Chelsea captain showed usual fearless body language. Chest out as he led Chelsea out into an arena which can generate one of the most intimidating atmospheres in Premier League. They were of course helped by the fact that his team were in control of the game from the sixth-minute  thanks to Oscar's free-kick. Terry was bang in the middle of the chaos which erupted when Cesar Azpilicueta was sent off, offering advice to referee Craig Pawson while avoiding trouble.

Fans: Terry is never a popular figure with the opposing supporters. Terry's name was jeered when the teams were announced before kick-off, and booed off the pitch at the end by home fans who chose to disregard his goal-scoring efforts here in March. 

He was jeered also when escaping a yellow card for chopping down Fraizer Campbell on the half-way line in the first-half to halt a quick Palace break. The Chelsea fans got behind him, as ever, and he made a long walk across the pitch to salute them after the final whistle, once he had changed into a yellow shirt with a '500 Thank You' message scrawled across the front with a marker pen.

Defending: Strong, assured and under-employed for long spells. Crystal Palace threatened early on, almost entirely on the counter-attack. There were one or two early alarms, although these surrounded his central defensive partner Gary Cahill more than Terry. 

The skipper's biggest problem came when he was entangled in the netting, having scrambled back to cover as Campbell sidled past Cahill and lobbed Thibaut Courtois, only for the effort drop over. There was a miscued back-pass, in the second half that required Courtois to be alert, which he was.

Once Fabregas had made it 2-0, Chelsea coasted in and Terry was unruffled, operating almost at walking pace until the late scare prompted by Campbell's goal. On the goal, he was unable to get close to cover Filipe Luis as Wilfried Zaha skipped inside from the right, but he couldn't really be blamed.

Attacking: Terry caused problems from set-pieces. He went close with a header from a corner swung across by Fabregas in the first half, when Chelsea were 1-0 up.

 It was cleared off the line by James McArthur. He also created a chance for Nemanja Matic having crept unmarked into the Palace box, soon after Damien Delaney had been dismissed. 

Terry's headed across goal to Matic, who headed narrowly wide.

All in all, it proved a far better day than his last trip to the Palace and a nice way to enjoy a landmark occasion. Chelsea fans ended the day singing about their position at the summit of the Barclays Premier League. Like JT's hair, they appear destined to remain a bit longer on the top.
