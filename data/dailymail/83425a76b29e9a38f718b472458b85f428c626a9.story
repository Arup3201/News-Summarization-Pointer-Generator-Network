The 23-year-old Miss Alabama posted a picture of her posing on the front cover of Alabama Weddings magazine, while her Alabama quarterback beau featured on the cover of Bama Dynasty nearby in the magazine racks.

Big day: Katherine Webb makes a beautiful bride

Southern belle Katherine has been modelling for Alabama Weddings magazine since 2007 - even appearing as a blonde.

And the magazine editors are justifiably proud of their relationship with her, as they wrote on a blog: 'We never would have guessed that the attention of America would have been focused on our sweet cover model, Katherine Webb.

'The national media may have just discovered Katherine’s beauty (only ONE aspect of this wonderful young woman mind you,) but we have long known that Miss Webb has a grace that shines radiantly on camera.

'She embodies the grace, poise and charm of a true Southern lady and we couldn’t be happier that all of America can now see that too.'

Katherine became a sensation after ESPN's cameras 
panned to her during the University of Alabama’s victory in the BCS 
title game earlier this month - sparking fawning comments from 
sportscasters Kirk Herbstreit and Brent Musburger.

Speaking about AJ, 22, her father, Alan Webb, 52, told MailOnline: 'He's very respectful and polite. My wife's family have met him and all commented on what a really friendly and down to earth guy he is.'

Mr Webb said that his daughter does not want to pursue celebrity status, saying: 'She wants to give back to people. A lot of people don't know her and know what a tender heart she has concerning others.

'They see her as this new celebrity, but there's great depth to her.'

However, Katherine does seem to be making the most of her new-found fame.

She has already appeared in front of the cameras for Sports Illustrated swimwear issue, and TMZ today reported that AJ had given her his blessing to 'go ahead and get famous.'

The model will appear on new ABC show, Celebrity Diving, alongside Detroit Lions badboy Ndamukong Suh, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Nicole Eggert, Kendra Wilkinson, Louie Anderson, Drake Bell, Chuy from the E! Network, and Keshia Knight Pulliam.

The Alabama native, who currently lives in LA, will also be covering the Super Bowl for Inside Edition, calling the job 'an honor and a dream come true'.

A source told TMZ that AJ is totally on board with the deals, despite initially be resistant to his girlfriend's fame, believing that she was stealing the spotlight from Alabama's championship.

But now that a couple of weeks have passed, he's fully supportive as Webb has hired a publicist and manager to secure deals.

Meanwhile Katherine took to her Twitter account today to dismiss a report that she was moving to New York - and was in talks to appear on Dancing With The Stars, by writing, 'Definitely not moving to NYC. love to dance! But no DWTS.'

Katherine became an internet hit after her appearance at the Miami stadium, sparking fawning comments from sportscasters Kirk Herbstreit and Musburger.

'I'm telling you, you quarterbacks, you get all the good looking women,' 73-year-old commentator Brent Musburger gushed as the camera stayed on her. 'What a beautiful woman.'

'Wow!' former Ohio State quarterback Kirk Herbstreit added. 'AJ's doing some things right down in Tuscaloosa.'

'If you're a youngster in Alabama, start getting the football out and throw it around the backyard with pop,' added Musburger, who has been married to his wife Arlene for 50 years.

Since then she has done a slew of interviews, TV appearances and photo shoots and has been offered a number of jobs.

Katherine, who grew up in Montgomery, 
Alabama, and graduated from Auburn, finished in the top 10 in the Miss 
USA competition in June and lives and works as a model in Los Angeles.

She met AJ met over Twitter when a
friend connected them in November, and in December, the sportsman went 
to the pageant for Miss Alabama USA 2013, where Katherine ended her reign.

The pair have been together since and grinned for photographs together on Christmas Eve.

Alabama beat Notre Dame 42-14 at the game to win their third college football title in four years.

McCarron threw four touchdown passes and
finished with 264 yards through the air, while running back Eddie Lacy 
and receiver Amari Cooper had two scores each.
