Dressed in a Union Flag romper, the doll can cry, gurgle and react to sounds. German makers Zapf insist however the toy is not based on Prince George

He is a cute little bundle of joy named George.

But
 the gurgling plastic doll is not based on the latest addition to the 
Royal Family – at least that is what the German makers claim.

They
 insist they have launched the £47.99 life-size doll, with its Union 
flag romper suit, merely to celebrate Prince George’s birth.

That
 may be because strict rules prevent manufacturers cashing in on the 
Royal Family and Zapf Creation could risk legal action by the Lord 
Chamberlain’s Office.

Zapf 
is renowned for its life-like dolls and has sold enormous numbers of its
 other famous creations, which include Baby Born and Baby Annabell. It 
insists it does not need royal permission for its latest product, out in
 time for Christmas.

‘This isn’t specifically “Royal Baby George” doll, rather an addition to the Baby Annabell Brother range, named George.

This
 is a reflection of George no doubt becoming a popular boy’s name,’ a 
Zapf spokesman said. ‘The royal doll features a beautiful regal-themed 
outfit.’

Baby George can cry tears, moves his eyes and mouth, gurgles and reacts to sounds.

‘When your little prince or princess 
looks after him, Baby George will respond by making realistic sounds and
 facial expressions,’ the Zapf spokesman said. ‘If Baby George starts 
crying, he can be comforted by singing a lullaby and when soothed he 
will respond with a contented sigh or a giggle.’

The Lord Chamberlain’s Office said the
 Baby George doll is not something that it would officially approve, 
although sources suggested any legal action to prevent it going on sale 
is unlikely.

The doll is 
not tipped to top the Christmas toy sales charts, though. Favourite to 
be the best seller, according to the Toy Retailers Association’s Top 
Ten, is another doll, the Flying Fairy by Flutterbye, which can take off
 and fly thanks to its rotating petal-like wings.

The annual Dream Toys listing, unveiled today by the Toy Retailers’ Association highlights the Top 50 toys expected to dominate the Christmas market.

Top contenders: Among the most sought after children's toys this Christmas is a robotic dog, a tablet computer aimed at helping ten-year-olds do their homework

Other familiar names include the Lego 
City Coast Guard set, a Rapidstrike Nerf gun, and an updated version of 
the Monopoly board game.

Among
 the traditional toys on the list are also two tablet computers, the 
LeapPad Ultra and the InnoTab 3S, a spinning flying fairy, and a 
glittering doctor’s bag for budding medics.

Furby enthusiast Emily Squires, 10, who was among children testing out the toys at a Christmas themed exhibition in Marylebone, central London, said she especially liked the new version of the popular because it can now be controlled an app on an Ipad.

She said: 'I love it. When you tickle it is laughs and it is so soft to stroke.

'If you use it with the app you can feed it and shower it, and it can even have a baby - a Furbling.

'I definitely want one for Christmas and I am sure that all my friends will want one too. The colours are really cool as well, and it is small enough to take with you wherever you go.”

Also creating a stir was the Teksta Robotic Puppy, which, like a real-life puppy responds to voice commands and hand gestures, can bark, cry and use its eyes to share feelings, unlike most family pets it also comes both blue and pink.

Shakira Riddell-Morales, 11, who spent the event playing with the dog, said: 'I really like that it can make it do a back flip and you can stroke him and feed him - it is a bit like a normal dog. I really want one for Christmas.'

Also expected to sell well in the category of technological products, is the LeapPad Ultra, a kids’ learning tablet aimed at four to nine-year-olds which is endorsed by children’s TV presenters Dick and Dom and designed specifically to help under-10s with their schoolwork.

Father-of-two, Dom Wood, said: 'It is fantastic and so child friendly and it really encourages them to use their imagination and be creative. They are learning without even realising it.

'It is also very safe and you can control what the kids are seeing and doing. It is such a minefield and this is 100 per cent safe.

'The screen is a good size, and unlike other tablets you can throw it around and it won’t smash. It’s so great that the kids feel like they are using something that is no different to what the adults are using, but are using something that is very child-friendly and educational.'

As well as creating new trends, some 
manufacturers have chosen to build on existing crazes, with One 
Direction Dolls sure to be snapped up by their legions of adoring fans.

Heart-throbs Harry, Niall, Louis, Liam and Zayn each come with their own personally styled outfits, and are sold individually for £16.99.

Even the traditional Christmas dolls, such as Zapf’s Baby Annabell, have drawn inspiration from real life events with the introduction of a commemorative HRH Baby George.

The doll which comes with a royal bib, is dressed in a regal-themed outfit and is housed in a specially designed box, for £47.99.

And it's good news for cash-strapped parents as the price of the average 'must have' Christmas toy will be £10 cheaper this year than in 2012 according to figures released at the show.

And although some of the items on this year's Dream Toys list will set some parents back a small fortune, the LeapPad Ultra alone retails at £119.99, the total cost of the ten best selling toys has fallen from £556.90 to £452.90 since last Christmas.

Most expensive on the list: The LeapPad Ultra is a pricey gift at £119.99 but it is a tablet computer designed specifically to be safe and education for young children

This means the average top ten selling toy will cost £45.29 this year compared to £55.69 12 months ago.

And this year 32 of the top 50 toys are also priced under £25 - making this festive season more affordable than last year.

Experts are predicting much cheaper toys 
will become the most popular gifts from Santa - including the £12.99 
Hexbug Aquabot, a robotic fish that swims in water.

Gary Grant, chairman of the Dream Toys committee, said: 'Christmas 2013 is set to be a strong year for toys and this is a great Dream Toys list that reflects not only the need for toys to appeal to all budgets and tastes, but also how tech is continuing to increase its influence within toys, from pads and robotic dogs to flying fairies and fish.

'There’s a real diversity in the list this
 year, which has a good spread of toys over different price points which
 I think shows how well the industry is reacting to the current economic
 market.'

On average, each UK child receives 44 
toys a year, valued at a total of £312, making the toy market in Britain
 valued at in excess of £3bn.

The Christmas period accounts for around £1bn of those sales, making the festive period the most important time for toysellers.

Parents at the fair yesterday welcomed the news that Christmas toys are cheaper this year.

Single mum-of-two Jenny Smith, from Rotherham, said: 'It’s great that there are so many cheap toys for my kids this year.

'I
 want to give them the best Christmas possible, but I’ve only just paid 
off last year, so I really don’t want to end up in debt again.'

Children’s tablet gadgets are set to become an £80 million market by the end of the year, having topped a new retailers’ list of predicted Christmas top sellers.

Almost a million of the tablets will be 
sold in the UK by the end of the year, according to toy industry analyst
 Frederique Tutt of NPD Group.

The popularity of the tablet has aided a 6% increase this year in sales of toys with a price tag of £50 or more, according to NPD, a trend it expects to continue through to Christmas.

However today's list, selected by a panel representing 80% of toy retailers, suggests traditional favourites are still holding their own, with sales of fashion dolls, classic board games and vehicle playsets all up on last year.

Ms Tutt said: 'We anticipate close to one million children’s tablets will be sold in the UK by the end of the year, making this a £80 million plus market.

'In the UK, as in the rest of Europe, people are influenced by a difficult economic climate. Impulse toy buying for instance is experiencing significant declines.

'However in this environment of cautious consumerism our research shows that items with high price tags sell very well, especially good quality brands and innovative concepts.

'Thanks to strong innovation in the hi-tech sector, as well as solid performances in more traditional segments, we expect the year to end on a positive note for the toy market.'
