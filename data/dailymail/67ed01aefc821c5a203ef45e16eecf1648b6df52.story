For Jason Denayer, this is no time to think about the future. Not when the present delivers so many challenges. Ronny Deila has made clear his wish for the 19-year-old Belgian to spend a second season on loan from Manchester City.

Any such plans are, however, being parked by Denayer while he concentrates on a packed schedule confronting Celtic as they pursue success on four fronts.

Saturday’s victory was the centre-half’s first competitive appearance in almost two months following a foot injury.

He played an important role in a solid, efficient display, which was gilded by two fine goals that pushed the champions to within two points of leaders Aberdeen with two games in hand.

Deila’s men now face two more Premiership games this week before a seismic League Cup semi-final against Rangers at Hampden. A Scottish Cup tie against Dundee and Europa League encounters with Inter Milan then swiftly follow.

Meeting those demands is the focus for Denayer, who has also had to contend with personal sadness following the tragic loss of his childhood friend Junior Malanda.

The Wolfsburg player — a team-mate in the Belgian Under-21 side — was killed in a car crash nine days ago.

‘I need to wait until the end of the season and see what happens,’ said Denayer, when asked about the possibility of another year at Celtic.

‘There are a lot of things in my head at the moment and I just need to concentrate on playing games.’

The feedback from City about his loan has been positive, albeit with recognition of the gulf between their respective environments.

‘The club has said I am doing well here but the objective in the Premier League in England for City is different and is at a much higher level,’ he added. ‘So I need to do more again but we will see at the end of the season what happens.’

When Denayer first joined Celtic back in August, no one would have expected Deila’s team to be anywhere but the top of the table come mid-January.

The defender jokes that a genuine contest with Aberdeen extending into late April would be ‘too long’, but for now it is viewed as a positive.

Denayer hopes the increased pressure they currently face in the Premiership could also bring the welcome spin-off of ensuring minds stay sharp in the other competitions.

‘Is there a hunger in the team? Yes, because we need to win all our games,’ he insisted. ‘We need to be focused in every game, we have to play every game at the maximum level. There is an excitement. We are not leading by many points as is normal. We are now second and it’s really competitive. It is good for the league.

‘We now have to play every game at the maximum level but, if we were leading by a number of points, we would not have to.

‘It was nice to play a game. I feel good and felt no pain. The injury has gone and I can now do everything 100 per cent.’

Denayer came close to netting an own goal as a header from Accies’ interim player-manager Martin Canning caused a moment of first-half chaos.

He was spared by the reactions of Craig Gordon, who then produced an outstanding block on the follow-up to deny Mikael Antoine-Curier.

There had been a stodginess about much of Celtic’s early play — following last week’s training camp in Gran Canaria — but their breakthough goal after 33 minutes was a thing of wonder.

Leigh Griffiths edged the ball on to Kris Commons, who had the presence of mind to lay a first-time pass in front of the overlapping Adam Matthews. The right-back caught it perfectly, sending an unstoppable, swerving shot beyond Michael McGovern from 20 yards.

Hamilton would have felt well in the game at half-time but conceded within five minutes of the restart.

Again, Matthews was involved, delivering a deep cross from the right that found its way to fellow full-back Emilio Izaguirre at the far post. He picked out Liam Henderson and the 18-year-old midfielder wheeled to make a sweet connection with a left-foot snapshot that zipped inside McGovern’s right-hand post.

Dougie Imrie twice spotted a way back into the match for Accies, but was denied by another smart stop from Gordon before misdirecting a free header off target.

From here on in, most of the attention was focused on Commons.

The match had been billed in some quarters as his last for Celtic amid persistent interest from Bolton Wanderers, with his name chanted by the visiting support before he made way for Stefan Scepovic with 10 minutes remaining.

The full-time whistle then delivered a scene that seemed to confirm what was happening. Commons threw his boots into the Celtic fans in what, for all the world, looked like a fond farewell gift.

Deila denied that was the case and insisted the 31-year-old — stuck in a contract impasse — would have to source a new pair as he was going nowhere for the rest of the season.

That, however, seems unlikely to be the final word on this particular saga with a fortnight still to run in the current transfer window.

On and off the field, the coming weeks will go a long way to shaping Celtic’s season.
