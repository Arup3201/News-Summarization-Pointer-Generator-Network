For this unique underground flight Ivan had to use a specially designed balloon, which was smaller than a usual hot air balloon

Ivan described the trip as a 'once-in-a-lifetime opportunity'

The daring undertaking took place ten years after legendary space jumper Felix Baumgartner successfully base jumped into the same pitch-black cave.

The historic balloon flight - which was inspired by the visionary Jules Verne's book Journey to the Centre of the Earth - lasted about 25 minutes.

For this unique underground flight Ivan had to use a specially designed balloon, which was smaller than a usual hot air balloon and meant the pilot sat on two gas cylinders framed by iron pipes rather than inside a basket.

The Croatian National Tourist Board hopes the incredible video of Ivan's challenge will inspire other active tourists to visit Croatia

The experienced hot air balloon pilot has already broken four records in the Guinness Book of Records

Ivan, who was supported in the flight by the supported by the Croatian National Tourist Board, said: 'This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me to visit hell, right?

'It has been an incredibly difficult project. You must have the right balloon, the right weather, and the right support. I don't believe this is going to be repeated by anyone ever again.'

The experienced hot air balloon pilot has already broken four records in the Guinness Book of Records: for hot air ballooning over the South Pole, the North Pole, and the Mediterranean Sea, as well as for being the first man who stood, dived and flew over the North Pole all within 12 hours.

The Croatian National Tourist Board hopes the incredible video of Ivan's challenge will inspire other active tourists to visit Croatia and experience the country's beautiful landscapes.

First written records of the Mamet Cave, which is located in Obrovac in the Velebit Nature Park, date back to 1929.

The first descent to its bottom took place on July 5 1968, when topographic mapping and aerial photography were performed, to produce a map of the site which is still being used today.
