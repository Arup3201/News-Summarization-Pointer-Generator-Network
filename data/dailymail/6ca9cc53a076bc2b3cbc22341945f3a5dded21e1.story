At under eight feet wide, most people would automatically pity the owners of this narrow house.

But far from being cramped, this home gives a new meaning to the phrase 'good things come in small packages', as behind its thin door is a sprawling property that actually spreads to 22ft wide.

Tom and Sarah Tidbury have really made the most of their space after they purchased the period property in 2009.

Tom and Sarah Tidbury decided to make the most of their space - and even have a garden as part of their home

Nicknamed 'the Wedge' as it starts off thin before growing wide at the rear, the couple have extended the 721 square feet of space and being granted the right for a home extension.

And with a little creative thinking, the pair have transformed the 7ft 7ins wide place in Clapham, south west London, the Evening Standard reported.

Despite appearances the home, which the Tidburys call 'the Tardis' because people cannot believe 'how big it is once you get inside', accommodates four bedrooms, a long, thin garden,and a generously spaced kitchen.

To appease planners, who would only grant the property a three floor extension if the roof couldn't been seen from the street, as it is in a conservation area, a 'ski-slope roof' was created, which slopes down to wards the back and has skylights to allow in.

By using a sloping roof, more bedrooms could be built within the property, adding to its value

As the property extends and widens at the rear, creative uses of space make this tiny home feel a lot bigger

Clever space solutions mean that the room has ample space for the family's belongings - and amazes people with its roomy interior

There's certainly no slim pickings of
 where to relax in the house, as the roof meant they could maximise 
space by using slanted ceilings for bedrooms and a dining area built 
over the former patio, reached by walking through the kitchen, living 
room and the lobby.

Clever 
use of space includes wall to ceiling shelves for books and photographs,
 while huge glass doors give the place a feeling of airiness, the 
Evening Standard reported.

A shower room and a dining area that opens on to the garden has meant that the value of the house has nearly double.

It was purchased for £430,000, but is now estimated to be worth between £750,000 and £800,000. 

And their new spacious home with its increased value will undoubtedly be the envy of many a young would-be home-owner, who along with millions is struggling to get on to the property ladder.

Around one in three homeowners in England are pensioners as crippling house prices freeze younger generations off the property ladder, official figures revealed last week.

In a sign of the property crisis facing young people, the Government’s English Housing Survey revealed homeownership has dropped to its lowest level since the 1980s.

At its peak in 2003, 71 per cent of householders were ‘owner occupiers’.

Of the 14.4million homeowners in England, the largest number - by a considerable margin - are people aged 65 and over, equal to a record 30 per cent of the total.

There are 4.3million homeowners in this age group, which is more than a million higher than the total number for any other age group.

By comparison, there are just 2.6million ‘owner occupiers’ in the 35 to 44 age group, the age at which parents are raising a young family, with many desperate to do so in their own home.And the number between the age of 25 and 34, also with young families but likely to have had to pay an even higher price for their home, is nearly half this number at just 1.4million.
