Arjen Robben deserves his reputation as a diver and he added to his collection of tumbles shortly after coming on as a substitute for Bayern.

With the teams deadlocked it was clear that Bayern were getting more and more desperate for a goal – hence the call for Robben to enter the pitch.

Whilst Fernandinho may have made slight contact with his arm Robben went to ground and threw his legs out behind him making the possible contact irrelevant and the act worthy of an Oscar nomination.

Arjen Robben went down easily in the penalty box under the faintest of contact from Man City's Fernandinho

Robben, who came on as a late substitute, has a reputation as a diver and this did nothing to help it

Robben's theatrics didn't impress the referee, however, who waved play on following the incident

Robben replaced Thomas Muller with 14 minutes remaining at the Allianz Arena as Bayern searched for a goal

Robben's abundant talent is unfortunately overshadowed by his theatrics 

The additional assistant was perfectly placed and was unmoved for the penalty appeal but should have advised his colleague that a yellow card was appropriate.

After a dive at the World Cup in the summer Robben issued an apology – until he starts to get retrospective bans he will continue cheating to try and help his team.

What a pity that such a talented player will be remembered for his theatrics rather than his obvious skill and pace.
