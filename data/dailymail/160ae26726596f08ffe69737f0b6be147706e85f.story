Tom Hanks made a New York cabbie's day by inviting him backstage to his Broadway show after the two bonded over his films and Ferraris.

Proving himself every bit as warm-hearted as his roles onscreen, the actor was so grateful that a tired driver put off going home after his shift to make one last journey, the he gave him free tickets and a backstage pass as a reward.

The cab driver - known as Mr Ferrari for his love of the clothes sporting the car company's logo - told how he picked up Hanks without knowing who he was, and bonded with him over a cheeky reference to one of his films.

From then on, every time he picked up anyone in New York who knew Hanks, he forwarded a 'hello' - and was eventually rewarded with a follow-up invitation.  

The unlikely encounter, which took place on a journey through Manhattan, came after Hanks flagged down Mr Ferrari on Park Avenue and asked him for a ride to 74th St.

He didn't recognize Hanks immediately - as he had his cap pulled low over his face - and said he wasn't going that way so couldn't take him.

But he changed his mind shortly after and took him anyway.

He said: 'I think about it, and I start feeling bad for the guy, cause hey - I got a conscience. So I call him back to the cab and tell him to hop in', according to theHumans of New York blog.

His act of kindness is eventually rewarded months later when another passenger who knows Hanks forwards an exclusive invitation to see Mr Lucky - Hank's Broadway debut - then meet him backstage afterwards.

The two got along during the journey after Mr Ferrari made a reference to Hanks's character in the 2000 film Castaway, and Hanks took a liking to his driver's sportswear.

Describing the encounter, the driver recalled: '...He gets in the car all excited, all animated, and he's talking about all these things. But he's got his cap pulled down way over his eyes, so I can't see who it is.'

'But pretty soon I start to recognize his voice. And when we get to a light, I turn to him, and I look him in the eye, and I scream: "WIIIIIIILLLSSSSSOOOOOOON!!!" And that really got him. He started laughing hard.'

The two then reportedly struck up a friendship over the cabbie's penchant for Ferrari gear - he was wearing a cap and a shift at the time. At the end of the journey the two took a selfie together on the street.

Mr Ferrari then said he found himself picking up people who knew or had worked with Hanks - and every time forwarded a greeting 'from Mr Ferrari'.

Broadway debut: Hanks was starring in Lucky Guy at the time - between April and July 2013

And when one acquaintance sent the greeting on via text message he finally got a reply - and the offer to meet again.

The driver said: 'Then one day I’m driving, and I get a text from one of the people that I’d driven, and it says: "Mr. Hanks wants to invite you to see his Broadway show." 

'So I bring my lady to the show, and we get to go backstage and everything, and after the show, we’re waiting for him in his dressing room, and he walks in and screams: "Mr. Ferrari!"... The name of his show was Lucky Guy. How crazy is that? Cause that was me. A lucky guy!"

The cab driver does not reveal exactly when either the initial ride nor the visit backstage took place. But Lucky Guy's Broadway run lasted from April 1 2013 to July 3 the same year.

MailOnline has contacted Hanks's agent for comment.
