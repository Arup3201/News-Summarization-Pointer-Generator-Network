Bamber Gascoigne has ‘accidentally’ inherited one of Britain’s most historic stately homes – and it could be worth up to £10million.

The former University Challenge host has been left West Horsley Place near Leatherhead in Surrey by his aunt and godmother, the Duchess of Roxburghe, who was one of the train-bearers for Queen Elizabeth at the 1937 Coronation of King George VI.

The 50-room house, which has its roots in the 11th Century, has been visited by Royalty and was once owned by Sir Walter Raleigh’s son.

It is rumoured to have once housed Sir Walter’s head after his beheading for treason in 1618.

But despite its illustrious history, West Horsley Place has been at risk of falling into ruin.

Gascoigne, 80, who discovered he has been left the property only when he was contacted by his solicitor, has embarked on a mission to save the crumbling estate.

He and his wife Christina are sacrificing some of the extraordinary treasures they found inside to finance the expensive repairs.

They plan to sell an estimated £2.2million of jewels, paintings, furniture and artefacts through Sotheby’s auction house. Among them is the gown worn by the Duchess at George VI’s Coronation.

Gascoigne said he is committed to ensuring the house ‘continues to stand as a monument of its remarkable past’, and hopes to eventually open it to the curious public.

‘It was completely unexpected by me that I would be heir to her estate,’ he said of the Duchess.

‘She had expressed that, given the work required to restore the house, she expected I would sell it.

‘But it’s such an incredible place and we knew it well, so the idea of immediately selling it off seemed not only amazingly foolish but also missing the fun that was involved.

‘Having spent many memorable times with my godmother here, and knowing how special the house was to her and her family, together with my wife I decided to take up the challenge of carrying out the essential work to the house to ensure that it can withstand what may lie ahead over the course of its future.’

Christina said that once it was restored to its full glory it could be worth up to £10million.

The house itself was once visited by King Henry VIII for a 35-course banquet.

The Duchess, who was born Mary Evelyn Hungerford Crewe-Milnes in 1915, was one of the great beauties of her age and a goddaughter of George V. She died last year.
