Scandal: Cardinal Keith O'Brien resigned amid allegations that he made homosexual approaches to young trainee priests

Disgraced former Cardinal Keith O’Brien is to leave Scotland for several months after admitting inappropriate sexual conduct during his church career, the Vatican has said.

Britain’s most senior Catholic cleric resigned earlier this year amid allegations that he made homosexual approaches to young trainee priests.

The Vatican confirmed today that O'Brien will leave Scotland 'for spiritual renewal'.

The cardinal stepped down as leader of
 the Scottish Catholic Church at the end of February after admitting 
that his sexual conduct 'had fallen beneath the standards' expected of 
him during his almost 50-year career.

He indicated that he would not contest
 claims by three priests and a former priest of inappropriate behaviour 
dating back to the 1980s, and intended to retire permanently from the 
public life of the church.

O'Brien was an outspoken critic of homosexuality which he had called a 'moral degradation'.

Last year he was named 'Bigot of the Year' by gay rights group Stonewall and he had campaigned against moves to legalise same-sex marriage.

However, as the scandal broke there were claims he was in a 'longstanding physical relationship' with one of the men who made the allegations.

A Vatican statement said: 'His Eminence Cardinal Keith Patrick O’Brien... will be leaving Scotland for several months for the purpose of spiritual renewal, prayer and penance. Any decision regarding future arrangements for his eminence shall be agreed with the Holy See.'

It was reported earlier this month that the cardinal, originally from Ballycastle, Co Antrim, was to settle in Dunbar, East Lothian.

The Vatican said today his departure from Scotland was 'in agreement with the Holy Father'.

When he resigned the cardinal issued as apology saying: 'I wish to take this opportunity to admit that there have been times that my sexual conduct has fallen below the standards expected of me as a priest, archbishop and cardinal.

'To those I have offended, I apologise and ask forgiveness. To the Catholic Church and people of Scotland, I also apologise.

'I will now spend the rest of my life in retirement. I will play no further part in the public life of the Catholic Church in Scotland.'

The cardinal had been the Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh since 1985.

Ordained as a priest in 1965, he was proclaimed a cardinal by Pope John Paul II in October 2003.
