Lewis Hamilton took time out from his busy schedule to attend the Elle Style Awards 2015 on Tuesday night.

The reigning Formula One champion, who was taken ill during F1 testing last Thursday, looked in good spirits as he made the most of his time away from the track.

Held at the newly opened Sky Garden in the Walkie Talkie building in London, the annual event celebrates the world’s most stylish stars, emerging talent and fashion’s greatest achievers.

Hamilton will return to the track this Thursday as testing resumes before the season gets underway next month.

The 30-year-old, who won the title by 67 points last year, will be looking to get the new campaign underway in positive style, with the first race taking place in Melbourne on March 15.

Hamilton will be hoping for an altogether different performance in this year's Australian Grand Prix though, after being forced to retire on lap three of the same course last year.
