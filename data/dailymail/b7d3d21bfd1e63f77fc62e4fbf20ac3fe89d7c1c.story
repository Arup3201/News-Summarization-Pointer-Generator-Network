Revelations: Theresa May, pictured yesterday, will face further criticism today as Brodie Clark is questioned by MPs about the Border Agency scandal

Passport checks were relaxed nearly 2,500 times at airports this summer, according to leaked UK Border Agency emails.

The damning documents also reveal that thousands of passengers on private aircraft did not face passport checks at all and were not screened against the terrorist watch list.

In one email, a UKBA official at Durham Tees Valley Airport raised concerns with managers, complaining: ‘We are not allowed to physically see the passengers arriving on private charter flights. It is creating a situation where we are not able to secure the borders as robustly as we would like, for no justifiable reason.’

In a leaked reply, one manager revealed that this policy was followed at airports around the country.

The revelations will increase pressure on Home Secretary Theresa May, who faces criticism today as former Border Agency boss Brodie Clark is questioned by MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee.

He resigned last week after Mrs May accused him of taking a pilot scheme to relax biometric passport checks on EU citizens too far by including non-EU passengers.

But Mr Clark hit back, insisting he had been given permission to extend the scheme.

Last night, in written answers to the committee, Mrs May admitted the pilot scheme was trialled at 28 ports and airports.

The leaked emails obtained by the Labour Party reveal that level-two checks – the relaxed regime for EU nationals sanctioned by the Home Secretary – were used hundreds of times every week for the 14 weeks the scheme ran between July and November.

They show the rules were relaxed 100 times in the first week, 260 times in the sixth week and 165 times in week nine.

Averaged out over 14 weeks, that would mean border staff could have abandoned full biometric passport checks 2,450 times.

Questions: Brodie Clark faces MPs today

Official figures show that 2.2million British and EU nationals and more than 300,000 non-EU citizens enter the UK every week over the summer. Between 80,000 and 90,000 private flights, mostly carrying two or three passengers, arrive every year. Pilots on private flights have to file manifest information on their passengers and these details are scrutinised for security threats.

But the emails reveal UKBA staff at 
Durham Tees had ‘no way of checking whether the handling agent 
information is correct or even if the number of people arriving on [the]
plane matches the number we have been advised’.

An
email in June says that staff ‘feel uneasy about an instruction that is
creating an unnecessary gap in security which could bring the Agency 
into disrepute’.

In response, UKBA chiefs said the ‘no-checks policy’ was part of a ‘new national strategy’.

Shadow
Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: ‘This is startling. Last week the 
Home Secretary told us no one had been waved through without checks this
summer. But these documents show passengers on private flights weren’t 
even seen.

‘Last week the Home Office wouldn’t admit to having figures about how often checks were downgraded. Now we know checks were downgraded 260 times in one week.’

Mrs May last night said that despite the relaxation of checks, figures showed ‘an almost 10 per cent increase in detection of illegal immigrants and a 48 per cent increase in detection of forged documents compared to the year before’.
