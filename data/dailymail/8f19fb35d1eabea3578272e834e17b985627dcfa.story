In case you get bored of cracking a thirst-quenching beer with a purpose-made bottle opener - you could always mix it up by using a chainsaw.

A fair dinkum Aussie bloke has mastered the fine of art of knocking the top off a bottle of beer with his high-powered cutting tool which he very proudly had his mate film and post on YouTube.

Decked out in singlet top and cargo shorts, the barefooted and tattooed man was full of confidence and bravado as he approached the stubby with the revving chainsaw.

His mate, who was filming the footage while holding the beer, wasn't quite so convinced there would be a successful outcome.  

'What do you want me to f*****g do?' he asked while nervously laughing.

'Hold it like that,' the chainsaw-wielding friend instructed before adding 'I told you to open the f*****g stubby!'

Still not entirely convinced the camera man tried to talk his mate out of the outrageous stunt. 

'It's a dumb idea bro,' he said still uncontrollably cracking up.

The well-deserved reward - necking the bottle of beer within seconds after his thirsty work

But as cool as a cucumber, his pal approached the bottle in an unexpected delicate fashion and seamlessly pops the top of the bottle with great precision.

The camera man instantly went into complete hysterics from relief as his cocky mate casually steps back still revving his inventive and extra powerful new bottle opener.

Extremely in awe and unable to stop laughing from disbelief, his mate passes him the well- deserved brew which the man downs in a matter of seconds.

Opening bottles of beer - is clearly thirsty work. 

Clearly not camera shy the dare devil shows his delight at his stunt by revving his chainsaw in the air
