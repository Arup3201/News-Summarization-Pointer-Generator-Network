As Bitcoin’s value continues to rise, hackers have found increasingly sophisticated ways to illegally ‘mine’ the virtual currency.

Now a new method has been uncovered which uses malware infected adverts on Yahoo to make computers into Bitcoin slaves.

Yahoo has confirmed that the breach took place last week and experts now believe as many as two million European users could have been affected.

In this recent attack, the hackers used malware to exploit something known as ‘Bitcoin mining’.

The mining process works on the premise that there are 21 million Bitcoins hidden across an internet-based network, which are expected to all be found by 2040.

To unearth Bitcoins, computers have to solve the complex processor-intensive equations which hold them. The more powerful the machine the better it is at solving the riddle.

Computer-makers have been creating high-powered souped-up computers so they can do it repeatedly and rapidly to collect the most coins.

Bitcoin is a distributed peer-to-peer 
digital currency that functions without any central authority, such as 
the Bank of England.

The currency was launched in 2009 and is traded within a global network of computers.

Bitcoins can be bought with near anonymity, which supporters say lowers fraud risk and increases privacy.

But critics say that also makes Bitcoins a magnet for drug transactions, money-laundering and other illegal activities.

A
 Bitcoin investor, Norwegian Kristoffer Koch, recently made more than 
half a million pounds after he forgot he bought £17 of currency four 
years ago.

Bitcoin mining malware is designed to steal computing power to make it easier for criminals to collect the virtual currency, without using their own high-powered computers.

Other than a slow computer, those infected with the maleware be unaware that their machine is being used in what could become known as a ‘bitnet’.

Experts estimate that these criminal networks could be generating as much as $100,000 (£60,000) each day.

The value of Bitcoin rose to over $1000 (£613) last year but is currently worth around $850 (£520).

Unlike traditional banking, Bitcoin and its rival virtual currencies, can be bought with near anonymity which supporters say lowers fraud risk and increases privacy.

Yahoo has come under for not or doing anything to help those who had been targeted with the malware, which attacked flaws in Java modules on systems.

Fox IT, the Dutch cybersecurity firm which first disclosed the vulnerability to the public, estimated that there were around 27,000 infections every hour the malware was live on the site.

Users in North America, Asia Pacific and Latin America, as well as those using Apple Macs and mobiles, weren't affected, the group said.

‘The attack focused on outdated software,’ Steve Regan of security site CSO told the Guardian.

‘The only way for the exploits to work is to have outdated versions of Java on your system. If Java is up to date, then the odds are, you're safe.

‘However, I don't trust Java, so unless you absolutely need it, my advice is to uninstall it from your system. It seems like I see more zero-day attacks aimed at Java than anything else, the risk isn't worth it for me.’
