Three Britons told consular officials they were ‘brutally’ tortured while on holiday in Dubai but staff dealt with their claims by merely writing notes to other officials, it has emerged.

Grant Cameron, Karl Williams and Suneet Jeerh say they were beaten, stripped and given electric shocks by police when arrested in July.

However, British diplomats dealt with the allegations by sending an ‘official note’ to Dubai’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs 12 days after the arrests.

Brutal: Britons Grant Cameron, Karl Williams and Suneet Jeerh say they were brutally tortured while on holiday in Dubai but UK diplomats dealt with their claims by merely writing notes to other officials

Consular staff admitted that they did not do anything else until the end of October, when they said they would send another note.

Mr Cameron and Mr Williams, both 25 and from Wanstead, East London, deny possessing and dealing in ‘spice’, an illegal synthetic cannabis. Mr Jeerh, 24, from Ilford, denies possession.

Rori Donaghy, of the Emirates Centre for Human Rights, said: ‘It’s much more about protecting our trade than dealing with human rights violations.’

The FCO said: ‘We have raised, and continue to raise, these allegations at the most senior levels.’
