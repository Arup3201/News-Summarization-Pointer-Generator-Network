The back page of the Liverpool Echo always plays to a theme when a big Champions League night comes around and today is no different.

In bold, capital letters, above a picture of Steven Gerrard and Brendan Rodgers sitting side-by-side, runs a headline that sums up the mood of one-half of this city’s fans, as they prepare for the glitz and glamour of Real Madrid.

‘Bring on the Champions,’ it declares.

So big is the game that the Liverpool players arrived at Anfield hours before the game. Raheem Sterling and captain Steven Gerrard were pictured arriving at the ground in their club tracksuits where they are expected to leave their cars and head to a nearby hotel for their pre-match meal and team meeting.

Though Liverpool’s form this season has, at best, been erratic, all of what has gone before will be forgotten this evening in the build-up to kick-off. These, after all, are the occasions the club have built their reputation on, going head-to-head against the continent’s finest.

It was a game of this magnitude, one that captures the focus of the football world, that Liverpool hoped they would get when their return to the Champions League was confirmed on April 20, with a 3-2 victory over Norwich City at Carrow Road.

Given that triumph was in the midst of a charge for the Barclays Premier League, the significance of what Liverpool achieved on Easter Sunday was perhaps not appreciated at the time but, during the summer, as supporters began to look forward, realisation began to dawn.

For five years between 2004-2009, when Rafa Benitez was in charge, Anfield staged some of the most dramatic nights in its long and fabled history, with each campaign seeming to throw up games that would be talked about for years to come. Those nights added to the stadium’s aura.

They are easily recalled: Olympiacos, Juvenuts and Chelsea in 2004-05, the campaign which ended with Liverpool defying the odds against AC Milan in Istanbul; Barcelona and Chelsea (again) in May 2007; Inter Milan and Arsenal in 2008, Real Madrid in 2009.

The deeper Liverpool got into the competition, the greater the intensity of their play became which added to the electricity in the stands, the atmosphere crackling beneath the floodlights. Tickets for the Kop became the hottest in town, as fans wanted to experience Anfield on a European night.

‘It is tough to explain what it is like here,’ says Alvaro Arbeloa, the Real Madrid defender who was once of Liverpool. ‘These big Champions League nights are special occasions and it is a special sound. It is a once in a lifetime experience, a special environment you must experience once in your career.

‘You put that to one side because it is an important game. It is not case of warning my team mates but I have told them of the tremendous atmosphere. The supporters here will drive them forward. It is a special game for Liverpool as they have been five years out of the Champions League.

‘They will put us under pressure. The Anfield atmosphere will be working against us. I know what they are capable of on a European night. I am expecting a battle. We need to be ready for a tough, tough game.’

Arbeloa knows that Madrid will not just be playing the 11 men Brendan Rodgers selects but also the 40,000-plus who are crammed into Anfield; it is a stadium that can leave a mark on visitors, so much so that a quote from the fabled Johan Cruyff has been printed on a wall by the main entrance. It is also on a wall in the press conference room at their Melwood training base.

‘There’s not one club with an anthem like You’ll Never Walk Alone,’ said Cruyff. ‘There’s not one club in the world so united with the fans. I sat there watching the Liverpool fans and they sent shivers down my spine. A mass of 40,000 people became one force behind their team.

‘That’s something not many teams have. For that I admire Liverpool more than anything.’

It will be that way again tonight. Before Liverpool’s first game back in the Champions League last month Brendan Rodgers had two supporters, who travel around the world to watch Liverpool and run the local radio station Anfield FM, into his office at Melwood.

During the course of their conversation, Rodgers was told that if he 'thought the atmosphere was good against Manchester City (last April), wait until you see what it is like against Real Madrid.’

The wait it almost over. Liverpool have fought hard to bring occasions like this back. The challenge is now to show that they can compete on this stage and ensure this is not simply a one-off. Anfield needs to crackle again.

1. Inter Milan 3-1 (European Cup semi-final, May 1965) - This was the standard-bearer, a night that showed what Liverpool could become. Liverpool had won the FA Cup a few days earlier and 28,000 were on the Kop 90 minutes before kick-off. The manner of the return defeat in Italy still rankles.

2. St Etienne 3-1 (European Cup quarter-final, March 1977) - The night when Liverpool’s quest to become champions of Europe suddenly became reality. Kevin Keegan, Ray Kennedy and ‘Super Sub’ David Fairclough scored the goals as Bob Paisley’s side were hauled over the line.

3. Auxerre 3-0 (UEFA Cup third round, November 1991) – You may wonder what this game is doing in the list but it was an extraordinary night, as Liverpool overhauled a two-goal first leg deficit thanks a Jan Molby penalty, Mike Marsh’s header and Mark Walters’ sliding late effort.

4. Olympiacos (Champions League group stage, December 2004) – ‘I don’t want to wake up in the UEFA Cup tomorrow morning,’ Steven Gerrard said on the day of the game. He didn’t thanks to an extraordinary comeback that featured goals from Florent Sinama-Pongolle, Neil Mellor and a wonder strike from the captain.

5. Chelsea 1-0 (Champions League semi-final, May 2005) – The next time Anfield will have an atmosphere of this intensity is when they are on the brink of winning the Barclays Premier League. The stadium shook, Chelsea froze and Luis Garcia’s controversial goal sent Liverpool to Istanbul.
