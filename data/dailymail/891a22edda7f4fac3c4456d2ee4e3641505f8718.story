A desperate woman who stabbed herself in the neck in a busy Asda supermarket had lost her nine-year-old daughter to terminal illness just months before, it was revealed today.

Sobia Yousef, 36, died in front of horrified staff and shoppers in the kitchenware aisle of Asda in Shipley, West Yorkshire, on Tuesday morning.

Friends believe the death of her child five months ago caused a 'collapse in her mental state'.

Tragic: Sobia Yousef, 36, died in front of horrified staff and shoppers in the kitchenware aisle of Asda in Shipley, West Yorkshire, on Tuesday morning

Shock: The victim was found lying in an aisle after injuring herself in the neck. She could not be saved

Four days of official mourning have started at her mosque in Frizinghall, Bradford.

Bradford Councillor Imdad Hussain said she had undergone treatment at Lynfield Mount psychiatric hospital after her child passed away last year.

'It is a great tragedy which has left the whole local community and far beyondÂ  in shock,' he said.

'It is such a terribly sad way for anyone to end their life.

'Sadly it seems that she lost her nine-year-old daughter some five months ago and it was that which triggered the collapse of her mental state.

'Her daughter had been born with an illness and the doctors only gave the baby a year to live.

'However she managed to stay alive until she was nine and there was a very special and close bond between the mother and daughter.'

Investigation: Police shut off the supermarket after the incident, said to be driven by the woman's 'collapse in mental state'

He said the care and treatment she received from mental health professionals needed to be examined.

He said: 'Questions have to be asked of the authorities and organisations involved over what support was being given.'

One eye-witness said: 'One of the shop's first aiders was trying to give CPR.

'One of the young men who works there actually saw the woman stabbing herself in the throat. He's in terrible shock'.

The store was cordoned off for the majority of Tuesday as police forensic teams worked inside.

West Yorkshire Police were alerted at around 8.37am to the store, along with paramedics.

A spokesman for the police force said the woman was pronounced dead at the scene.

People in the area tweeted their shock at the incident.
