Alex Song has spoken of his excitement at facing Mario Balotelli when Liverpool travel to face West Ham - but will urge his 'brother' not to score against the Hammers on Saturday. 

Both players returned to the Premier League this summer after stints abroad, and the Italian scored the first goal of his Reds career in their Champions League victory over Ludogerets in midweek.

And Song, who made his Hammers debut against Hull on Monday night after joining on loan from Barcelona, told The Sun that he can't wait to face Balotelli during Saturday's evening kick-off.

The Italian got off the mark for Liverpool by netting against Ludogerets in the Champions League on Tuesday

'Mario is a strong player and a strong character. I love him because when people talk about him in a bad way, he can't wait to show people they are wrong.

'He goes out and it's like he says, "Look at me I am a bad guy but I can score a lot of goals".

'During games you want to be the winner and sometimes you have to do things you don't want to do. You know you have to be an example for the young kids and everyone makes mistakes. When you see guys on the pitch, you can sometimes think they are arrogant but they are not. Outside of football you see a different face on the man.

And Mario Balotelli joined Liverpool from AC Milan after 18 months in Serie A

'I have seen him do lots of things to make people smile. You can't buy smiles. At the World Cup I saw that he was doing lots of things for young people in Brazil, he was helping young kids.

'Last December I went to Guinea for a charity to help the poor and I asked him if he would sign a shirt for me. He said, "Don't worry my brother" and two days later a signed shirt from him and one from Kaka arrived.

'I have not spoken to him yet since I came back but I will talk top him during the game. I will just tell him, "Don't score. Don't score today. You can score every other week - just not today".'
