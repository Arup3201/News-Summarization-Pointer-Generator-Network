Powerful lights confiscated by police during marijuana raids are now being used by the groundsman of League One club Rochdale to help grass grow on its pitch.

Police donated the lights to the club last week to avoid having to pay for their disposal, after groundsman Oli Makin approached them having heard of a similar deal working with Notts County.

Makin bolted together two old goalposts, attached the lights and placed the rig over damaged areas of the playing field, such as the goalmouth.

Makin says 'we wouldn't be able to buy the rigs that Premier League clubs have because of the cost - the small ones cost £30,000.'

Detective Inspector Jim Faulkner told the Manchester Evening News: 'I think it's a great idea - it's helping to grow the right kind of grass.

'It's criminal property that would have ordinarily been destroyed, but now it can help the local community free of charge and prevents it from being dumped in a landfill.'
