A ‘lack of trust’ in his relationship with Chris Froome has been cited as the reason why Sir Bradley Wiggins will not be on the start line in Yorkshire for this year’s Tour de France. 

While Team Sky insisted on Friday that a final decision on team selection would not be made until the end of this month, Wiggins broke ranks to say he was ‘gutted’ not to be riding.

He will not be alone, with British cycling now faced with losing its biggest star for the three days the Tour will be here in the UK next month. Losing its biggest star when he happens to be in top form, having recently won the Tour of California.

‘If Brad doesn’t ride it will be a disaster for the sport in this country,’ said one senior figure in cycling. ‘Here was a chance to showcase the sport here in England with the last two winners of the Tour, who are both British. But because they don’t get on, the one who’s most popular with the fans is not going to be there. It’s embarrassing.’

The situation points to a complete failure by Sky’s management to resolve a problem that has existed between the two riders since the 2012 Tour. Sir Dave Brailsford has proved himself a master administrator for more than a decade. But Wiggins pointed out that he and Froome have been kept apart all year —  not racing or training together — and that he has therefore been denied any opportunity to prove he is prepared to play support rider to last year’s Tour winner.

In an interview with the BBC on Friday, Wiggins said: ‘The team is focused around Chris Froome. I am gutted. I feel I am in the form I was two years ago. Now if I want to go to the Tour again, the reality is that I might have to go elsewhere. I also understand that cycling is a team sport and it is all about Team Sky winning and Chris is defending champion.

‘For the dynamic of the team, Chris has a say and we haven’t raced together all year. When you’re in the heat of the moment, you need guys you can trust and who have been there for you. Tensions can rise between two riders.’

Ambition: Wiggins hopes to race in the Tour de France again, and wants to return to the track for Rio 2016

It would be wrong to portray Wiggins too much as the victim here because there has been a degree of stubbornness on both sides in resolving the situation. This despite claims by both riders that they had cleared the air during a training camp towards the end of last year.

Sources close to the pair say the atmosphere is ‘dreadful’ when they are together, with Froome sometimes ‘intimidated’ by a colleague of Wiggins’s stature. 

But the key problem for Froome, says the source — after their very public spats in the wake of the 2012 Tour — is ‘a lack of trust’ within what is a team sport. 

With his contract expiring this year, Wiggins said he is considering his future at Team Sky having ‘spoken to a few people’ linked to rival teams.

‘Having missed the Tour again this year, I wouldn’t like to leave it there,’ said Wiggins, who also has his sights on a return to the track for the 2016 Olympics in Rio. ‘I’d love to go back at some point so there is the chance that I would go back to the Tour next year.’

While Wiggins is bitterly disappointed, this will not necessarily play well for Froome, either. As he explained in a recent interview with this newspaper, he has a say as to which nine riders make up the team and it is clear he has had a major influence here. 

In a separate interview with the French sports daily L’Equipe, Wiggins said: ‘After Paris-Roubaix and the Tour of California, I felt good physically, I was ready to go. But these last few weeks, it has become more and more clear that I will not be at the Tour.’   

Wiggins said he last spoke with Team Sky principal Brailsford earlier this week — who suggested that he concentrate on preparing for the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow this summer.

‘It’s disappointing because it could have been my last Tour de France,’ said Wiggins. ‘I’ve had my doubts since April. I hoped my performances would get me a place. But then, after California, I knew that they were all off on an altitude camp, but I wasn’t involved, nor was I involved in the Tour reconnaissance rides.

‘The plan since the world championships last year was that, in an ideal world, Chris and I would ride together in the Tour and that everything would go well. I understood the role I would play, that Chris would be the leader and I was 100 per cent behind that. I wanted to play that support role. Then Shane Sutton (British Cycling’s technical director) told the press that I would have to fight very hard to win my place, that it was now Chris’s team and that Chris clearly had a say in selection.’ 

Wiggins also said he had spoken to the Orica-GreenEdge team about joining them next season.
