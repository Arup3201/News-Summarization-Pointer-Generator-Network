She's the proud owner of some of the glossiest locks in showbiz and now Kim Kardashian West is letting fans in on her secret by unveiling her own hair range.

The 34-year-old has collaborated with her sisters, Kourtney and Khloe, on the new range, which has just gone on sale.

The Kardashian Beauty range features tools such as a flat iron, a blow-dryer and a three-in-one tool as well as seven styling products - a blow-dry cream, volume mousse, dry shampoo, dry conditioner, firm hair spray, curl cream, and black seed dry oil.

The Kardashian sisters have unveiled their haircare range, which is full of dry conditioner, curl cream, and black seed dry oil; Kim, pictured, announced the news on her Instagram 

Kim announced the news via her Instagram page and thanked her followers for all of their early feedback on the hair products.

She said: 'LOVING all of your feedback so far on our hair care products! We worked so hard on this & I know you will all love it! Xo'.

The range is sold on Ulta Beauty and straighteners cost $89.99 (£59), while products such as their dry shampoo will set you back $13.99 (£9).

One product with a curious ingredient is the Kardashian Beauty Black Seed Dry Oil, which is described as 'a nutrient rich treatment and styling aid that rejuvenates and nourishes hair so it appears strong, thick, smooth and gloriously shiny'. 

The range, which forms part of their Kardashian Beauty collection, includes tools - such as straighteners and hair dryers - as well as products like dry conditioner and curl defining cream

Speaking to FEMAIL recently, Kim said: 'As far as products, I love  the Kardashian Beauty dry shampoo and conditioner, which we have. I've never seen a dry conditioner out there but it really helps when you're trying to not wash your hair.'

Another product the sisters swear by is coconut oil, which they say is 'everything'.

'When I take off my make-up, I use avocado oil or coconut oil and I also sleep in it, it's amazing for dry hair,' explained Khloe. 'You can put it on your body, too. Coconut oil can do everything.'

The launch of the new products comes shortly after Kim and her husband Kanye West were named as the new faces of Balmain.

The couple - who married in a lavish Italian ceremony in May 2014 - are close friends of the Parisian brand's creative director, Olivier Rousteing, and were chosen to appear in their adverts.

He said: 'Together, they represent love, beauty and diversity - they are the new modernity. This is more than a campaign, it expresses something beyond clothes - it is a celebration of love and friendship. This is a new statement for Balmain.'
