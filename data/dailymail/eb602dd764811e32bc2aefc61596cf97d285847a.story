The family of a grandmother run over by a Bronx teen on Thanksgiving Eve is outraged over the lack of remorse in social media posts made while the matriarch lie brain dead in a hospital.

Ashley Viviana Davios, 19, spent the day after Thanksgiving posting about leftovers and needing clear her head – while Maria Lucaj, 55, was dying in a hospital.

The teen ran over Ms Lucaj as she rounded a corner in her 2013 Ford Focus just after 6pm Nov 27, according to the New York Post.

The distraught teen stayed at the scene and did not appear intoxicated, sources told the paper. She said she did not see the woman in the crosswalk.

Ms Lucaj, who had the right of way, died later Thanksgiving weekend.

Criticism of the teen has come from a series of tweets made as the grandmother’s devastated family made preparations for her death and remained beside her hospital bed.

Shortly after telling friends she wanted to go to SoHo, she sent an eye-opening tweet that surely caused people to wonder who much remorse she felt.

‘All I really need right now is to clear my head and find peace of mind,’ she tweeted.

Not long after, she tweeted a picture of food with the caption ‘LEFTOVERS.’

She followed that up by retweeting the message ‘I love the holidays because I was able to see everyone that truly matters.’

No remorse: Ms Davios was more worried about leftovers, clearing her head and shopping than she was the woman she ran over with her car

As if not bad enough, she fired out the following tweet the day after Ms Lucaj died from the injuries resulting from being mowed down.

‘Karma needs to just slap the s–t out of you.’

The dead matriarch’s family was in disbelief when told of the tweets.

‘I couldn’t believe it,’ son Robert told the Post. ‘She’s posting about leftovers while my mother’s brain-dead in the hospital.’

‘She was showing no remorse,’ son Martin said, adding his mother was only steps from home – where she was going to prepare her family’s Thanksgiving meal.

‘To see [on Twitter] a meal that we weren’t able to have was heartbreaking,’ he added.

Attempts by MailOnline to reach Ms Davios via phone and email were not answered. Her Twitter account has since been deleted.

Police have yet to charge the teen with any crime, but the investigation is ongoing.
