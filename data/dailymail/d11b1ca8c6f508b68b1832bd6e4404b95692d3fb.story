The future of AC/DC is again in doubt, after drummer Phil Rudd pleaded guilty in a New Zealand court, to charges of threatening to kill and of possessing drugs.

Rudd, 60, was charged with two counts of threatening to kill and possession of methamphetamine and of cannabis, which stem from a police raid on his waterfront North Island mansion on November 6.

The veteran rocker had originally pleaded not guilty to the charges. But with his judge-alone trial due to begin on Tuesday, in the Tauranga District Court, his lawyer changed his plea to guilty.

AC/DC drummer Phil Rudd climbs out of his car as he arrives to face charges at the District Court in Tauranga, New Zealand. The 60-year-old Australian, who has lived in Tauranga for over 30 years, hit the headlines last November when he appeared in court accused of attempting to hire a hitman to kill two people.

Phil Rudd arrives at court to change his plea to guilty but the maximum sentence for threatening to kill is seven years in jail. The case has been adjourned until June 26 when Rudd's lawyer will apply for a discharge without conviction

One 'threatening to kill' charge has been dropped and he has been remanded Rudd on bail, with existing conditions, until sentencing on June 26.

Rudd was also initially charged with "attempting to procure murder", but it was dropped after prosecutors decided there was insufficient evidence to proceed.

The court had earlier heard that Rudd wanted a former security guard 'taken out'.

The case has left Rudd's position with the top-selling band in doubt. Drummer Chris Slade replaced him for a performance at the Grammys in Los Angeles.

While Slade suggested he would also play in the upcoming "Rock or Bust" world tour, Rudd said last year that he wanted to keep his job.

A summary of facts released by prosecutors last year alleged that Rudd threatened to kill a man and his daughter in a phone call in September.

He also allegedly called a business associate and detailed what he wanted done to the man.

The document alleged that when police raided Rudd's home they found 0.71 grams (0.025 ounces) of methamphetamine and 130 grams (4.5 ounces) of cannabis.

Threatening to kill charges carry a maximum jail term of seven years in New Zealand.

Australian-born Rudd, has lived in the North Coast seaside town of Tauranga since 1983.

AC/DC will bring their 'Rock or Bust' world tour home to Australian in November after kicking off proceedings at the Coachella festival in the US and moving onto Europe

The highly anticipated Rock Or Bust tour will head Down Under in November.

The group, which began in 1973, kicked off the gigs at Coachella in California. From there it's onto Europe where they play Holland, Germany and Austria.

The band has not only had to deal with Phil Rudd's absence but also that of Malcolm Young, replaced by his nephew Stevie, after he retired because of dementia.
