A man kissed and spoke to his wife's feet after shooting her dead to collect her $1 million life insurance plan, police officers have testified.

Conrad Truman, 32, is on trial for the first-degree murder of his wife, 25-year-old Heidy Truman, who was found shot dead in their Orem, Utah home in 2012.

Although Truman has claimed that she either committed suicide or was gunned down by someone outside the home, officers testified at his trial that his bizarre behavior raised suspicion.

Officers had raced to the home after he made an emotional 911 call on September 30, 2012.

'There's so much blood. If they don't get here right now, she's gonna die,' he wailed in the 911 call, which was played at his preliminary hearing last year.

'I don't know what happened. I really don't know what happened, I swear to God. She was in the shower, she came out of the shower and I heard a pop, and there's blood, and she's in blood.'

Later, he shouted on the call: 'If you don't get here quick, my wife's life is on your head. My wife.'

After officers arrived, they found the home in disarray and Mrs Truman naked with a single bullet wound to her head. An investigation found the gun had been shot at close range.

In court this week, officers said that her husband's reactions aroused their suspicions.

Suspicions: Truman said his wife might have committed suicide but officers said they found he was acting suspiciously. Officer Chris Watson testified in court, pictured, that Truman was speaking to her feet

'He was talking to her feet and kissing her feet and saying he was sorry,' Officer Chris Watson testified, ABC News reported.

Officer Art Lopez added that Truman was threatening to kill the officers if they didn't save his wife.

'I have been in law enforcement for 20 years. I've never seen anyone until this time threaten to kill the officers,' Lopez said.

Officers added that Truman had allowed the couple's dogs to walk through evidence and he went to the bathroom without a police officer, the court heard. 

Prosecutors allege that he killed his wife so he could collect her $878,000 life insurance policy.

No evidence has been presented to show they had a troubled relationship but he has told officers they had an alcohol-fueled argument before she left for a shower, the Daily Herald reported.

Accused: Truman, pictured in court last year, refused to answer investigators' questions but was eventually arrested during a traffic stop in July 2013 - nearly a year after his wife was found killed

Scene: Truman suggested that someone might have shot his wife from outside as she took a shower

Before the shooting, Truman and his wife of three years had been watching the television show 'Dexter', which is about a serial killer, and drinking.

His defense team has argued that the reason he gave confused accounts of what had happened is because he was drunk and had just found his wife shot dead.

But after giving conflicting accounts, officers later tried to question Truman - but he failed to return their phone calls and refused to speak to them at his workplace.

Following an investigation into the death, he was eventually arrested during a traffic stop in July 2013, nearly a year after his wife died.

Truman has pleaded not guilty.
