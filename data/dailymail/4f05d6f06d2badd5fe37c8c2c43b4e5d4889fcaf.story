Cut: The St. Louis Rams released defensive end Michael Sam on Saturday, smashing his hopes of becoming the first openly gay player in NFL history

Sam still has a chance to get picked up by another team or to make the Rams' practice squad.

On Saturday, he attended Missouri's opener in Columbia, a 1 1/2-hour drive west on I-70 from Rams Park.

He was introduced to the crowd at the cut down deadline in the end zone alongside defensive E.J. Gaines, a sixth-round pick who made the team.

Sam blew a kiss and waved to the crowd, then walked back to the sideline.

He posed for a few pictures then started looking at his phone and headed for the locker room.

The Rams selected Sam, the SEC co-defensive player of the year at Missouri, with the 249th overall pick out of 256 overall during May's draft.

Sam came out following his final season at Missouri.

Rams coach Jeff Fisher was proud to have made the landmark pick, but he made clear from the start that he chose Sam because he thought he had the talent to make it.

The Rams selected Sam, the SEC co-defensive player of the year at Missouri, with the 249th overall pick out of 256 overall.

He kissed his boyfriend as a national television audience looked on, and arrived brimming with confidence and with a quick retort for anyone who contended he was in the NFL only because he came out.

The cameras followed, but the extra attention did not seem to faze Sam or his teammates.

Veteran defensive end Chris Long noted rosters are always made up of players from different backgrounds. One by one, players said Sam was now part of their family.

Coach Jeff Fisher called the draft pick a "second historic moment" for a franchise that signed running back Kenny Washington in 1946 as the league's first black player in the modern era, but he was most interested in describing Sam as a way to upgrade the Rams' defense.

So was general manager Les Snead, who referred to Sam after the draft as a 'designated pass rusher'.

Sam recognized the challenge, so he shed weight to be faster for special teams duty, reporting at 257 pounds.

After the Rams' first preseason game, a 26-24 loss to New Orleans, Fisher said Sam played 'pretty well' but also made his share of mistakes.

Sam, who was credited with one tackle and one quarterback hit in the game, emerged with confidence.

'You know, I can play in this league,' Sam said.

'I can play in this league.'

Sam told his teammates at Missouri that he was gay before his senior year, and judging by the results it was no distraction at all.

Dreams on hold: Sam still has a chance of being picked up by another team, despite being cut by the Rams. The Rams may still choose him for practice squad

The Tigers made a seven-win improvement and tied the school record with 12 wins. Sam had 11 1/2 sacks and the lightly-regarded Tigers won the SEC Eastern Division, a huge step forward after going 5-7 during the first season in their new conference.

More than 100 coaches and players kept the revelation to themselves.

Sam came out in February.

'If you look at our season, it didn't hurt us at all,' recalled cornerback E.J. Gaines, a fellow rookie and former Missouri teammate.

'If anything, it brought us closer.'

Sam was lightly regarded out of Hitchcock, Texas, a town of about 7,000 along the Gulf Coast about 40 miles southeast of Houston.

His first two years at Missouri, Sam backed up Aldon Smith and Jacquies Smith, both of whom are in the NFL.

The Rams drafted Sam even though they didn't need help at defensive end, where they have a pair of first-round picks as starters.

The Rams were so well-stocked with picks, taking 11 players overall, they had leeway to take a shot.

Fisher said Sam's value as a player 'was off the charts'.

'I'm determined to be great,' Sam said at his introductory news conference, packed with reporters.

'I understand that right now you guys want to make a big deal of it.'

From the start, teammates seemed to like having Sam around.

His energy was infectious and, if there were problems, they stayed behind closed doors.

Publicly, Sam was just another late-round pick trying to make the Rams, which, like other NFL teams, held sensitivity training early in camp.

The Oprah Winfrey Network put off a planned documentary on Sam, saying it would allow him to focus on his dream of making the team.

At one point, Sam's Rams jersey was the No. 2 seller among rookies at NFLShop.com, trailing only Cleveland's Johnny Manziel, and Sam was among just 10 draftees selected by the NFL to be featured on commemorative coins.

Sam headed to the ESPY Awards to pick up the Arthur Ashe Courage award. He got a hug from Hall of Famer Jim Brown on his way to the stage and fought back tears throughout his speech.

'Great things can happen when you have the courage to be yourself,' he told the audience.
