Egyptian protesters have vented their fury about the country's military rule and the possibility of former Hosni Mubarak cronies winning power.

The country's biggest demonstration in months stepped-up pressure on generals to hand over power and called on anyone linked to Hosni Mubarak not to run in the looming presidential elections.

A crowd of many thousands, made up of Islamists and liberals, highlighted the anger some feel towards the ruling military who they blame for the country's political chaos.

A giant banner unveiled at the demonstration read: 'rejection of military rule.'

Pressure is piling up on the military leaders of Egypt after thousands chanted slogans and demanded the hand-over of power in Tahrir Square

Friday's huge demonstration came on the eve of the country's first presidential elections since Hosni Mubarak was ousted more than a year ago.

'Down with military rule,' protesters 
in Tahrir chanted.

Giant banners draped around the plaza 
denounced candidates seen as 'feloul,' or 'remnants' of the Mubarak era.

Liberals and youth 
groups called for all factions to agree on an anti-military 'revolution' 
candidate in the presidential vote.

The Muslim 
Brotherhood, Egypt's strongest political movement, has been frustrated 
that the military has prevented their domination of parliament from 
translating into real political power.

Muslim cleric Muzhar Shahine told the crowd on Friday: 'Today we came to 
demand that presidential elections take place on time, without delay 
even for a single day,'

He added: 'Let's forget the mistakes of each other, for the sake of our nation's interest.'

The presidential elections are 
scheduled for May 23-24 and a new president is set to be named in June.

The military council has promised to transfer power to an elected 'civilian administration' by early July.

Members of the council, in recent weeks, have said they don't intend to 
postpone elections and don't favour any particular candidate.

Islamists captured nearly 70 percent of 
the seats in parliament in elections held late last year, with the 
Brotherhood alone capturing nearly half the legislature.
