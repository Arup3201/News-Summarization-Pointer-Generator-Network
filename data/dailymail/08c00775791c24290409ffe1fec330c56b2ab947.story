A truck driver who was left seriously injured after a road crash refused to let firefighters save his life until he had called his wife to ask the question: 'Will you still love me with one leg?'

Kong Huang, 35, was left trapped inside his truck after a crash in southwest China.

He was driving a lorry loaded with sand when he hit another car on a bend in Suining, Sichuan province.

Kong Huang (pictured left) refused to be cut free by firefighters until he had called his wife Cheng

But when he was told by rescuers that they may have to amputate his leg to free him from the wreck, Mr Huang said that he would only agree to be saved once he had phoned his wife.

Mr Huang asked his wife Cheng Huang, 29: 'Precious one, I have just one question which you must answer 
truthfully.  I am hurt and may have to lose a limb.  My question is: 
Will you still love me with one leg?'

When she said yes, Mr Huang ended the call and told rescuers: 'Ok, go ahead, I can live.'

After a rescue operation which lasted several hours Mr Huang was cut free from the wreckage and was saved without his limbs being amputated.

Recovering in hospital, Mr Huang said: 'I was doubly blessed this day. I got the love of my wife 
unconditionally and I have the good fortune to return to her a whole 
man. I am very lucky.'

Staff spent almost a day clearing the wreckage from the smash.

Mr Huang had been told by rescuers that his leg could need to be amputated in order for them to cut him free from the truck. At that point, he decided to call his wife to ask if she would love him if he was disabled

It took rescuers a full day to clear the debris left from the collision in Sichuan, China. Once Mr Huang heard that his wife would still love him he said:'Ok, go ahead. I can live'
