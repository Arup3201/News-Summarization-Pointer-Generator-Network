A father-of-three diagnosed with leukemia was denied his life-saving health coverage after his wife accidentally missed 26 cents off their payment, the couple have revealed.

Sergio Branco, 33, from Edison, New Jersey, has been battling his insurance company after it refused to give him coverage for a bone marrow transplant even when he offered to send the extra change to correct the oversight.

The company only backed down when attorneys and the media heard about the case.

The spat came after Branco was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia - which can kill within months or weeks - and took three months off from his truck driving job under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) to start chemotherapy and transfusions, NJ.com reported.

Battle: Sergio Branco, who has leukemia, was denied health insurance coverage for a life-saving operation after his wife Mara, right, accidentally missed off 26 cents from their payment

Doctors said a $500,000 bone marrow transplant would prolong his life, which Branco knew his company insurance would cover.

But after three months, the FMLA time expired and his company, Russell Reid, fired him.

He
promptly applied for health insurance coverage through the Consolidated
Omnibus Reconciliation Act (COBRA), which allows a fired worker to keep
the same health insurance he had while he was working, but requires him
to pay the full premium.

Branco's
wife, Mara, called Paychex, which was handling COBRA for the company, 
to ask about the premium for Sergio and she was told it would cost 
$518.26.

Fight: Branco, who has three children, was fired from his job after taking three months off to begin his treatment and had to file for a special type of insurance for employees made redundant

Treatment: He needed the coverage for a $500,000 bone marrow transplant that will extend his life

But when it came to filling out the check, she mistakenly wrote $518 - missing off the 26 cents.

Paychex cashed the check nearly three weeks later and Branco continued to receive treatment. But weeks later, in June, his hospital said the insurance coverage had been terminated.

Paychex said that the payment had been 26 cents short and that the company had been instructed by Russell Reid not to accept any more payments from the family, Mrs Branco said.

She called Russell Reid, Paychex and the U.S. Department of Labor, but neither would help.

'There's nothing to comment on at this point,' Russell Reid's human resources representative Rich Gross told NJ.com. 'We’re still trying to figure it out.'

Coverage: Paychex refused to accept a further payment of 26 cents to cover the difference

Sergio Branco's doctor also pleaded for help on their behalf by writing a letter to the companies.

He wrote that Mr Branco 'will most certainly die in the very near future if he does not proceed to transplant; therefore I am writing to request that every effort be made to reinstate his health care insurance coverage'.

Again, nothing happened.

The Brancos hired an attorney, Jeffrey
Resnick, who went to court last week where he claimed that Branco 
should have been notified about the 26 cents before his coverage was 
terminated.

He added that the law also states that health coverage cannot be terminated for 'non-payment of a de minimis amount', and that the mistake was innocently made as Mara was juggling two young children, a teenager and a very ill husband.

Support: But Branco, pictured center with relatives, battled the company with attorneys and media coverage and now the health insurance has been reinstated, so he can undergo the bone marrow transplant

And after the New Jersey Ledger contacted the company, it said it is working on getting the coverage back.

'Paychex is working diligently with our client and other appropriate parties right now to reinstate Mr. Branco’s coverage,' said spokeswoman Laura Saxby Lynch. 'We are very ardently working on the situation with all parties including the carrier, and the decision ultimately rests with the carrier.'

Mrs Branco added that the Department of Labor said the insurance would be reinstated.

'They said the company did it wrong,' she said. 'I am super happy. It’s like a weight has lifted off my shoulder. It’s better than winning the lottery.'
