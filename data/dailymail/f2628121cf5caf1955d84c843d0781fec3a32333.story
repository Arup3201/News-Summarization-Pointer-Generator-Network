Earlier his week designer Alice Temperley described the Duchess of Cambridge as the 'perfect modern day woman'. And this evening Kate illustrated how this means she isn't afraid to wear the same dress more than once as she stepped out in a gown by the designer she's previously worn on two occasions.

The black lacy number, called Amoret, is more daring than the Duchess's usual outfit choices thanks to its plunging neckline and figure-hugging fishtail style.

She has worn it on two public engagements before - to the War Horse premiere in January 2012 and then at a fundraising night for her former university, St Andrews, in November of the same year.

Kate made a quick change into the floor-length gown to attend the screening of a 'ground-breaking' film by naturalist and broadcaster Sir David Attenborough at the Natural History Museum with Prince William.

Earlier in the day, she had worn a sombre black suit with white polka dots as she and her husband formally paid their respects to anti-apartheid hero Nelson Mandela by signing his book of condolence.

Tonight, Kate accessorised her lacy dress with 3D glasses as she was given a first glimpse at Attenborough's Alive 3D, which sees the documentary maker bring to life his favourite extinct creatures through 3D technology.

The Duchess, who is a patron of the 
museum, and the Duke attended a reception with the film's producers 
and listened to a question and answer session with Sir David, whose 
broadcasting career has spanned more than 60 years.

New mother Kate - who showed no signs of having sleepless nights with baby Prince George - has long been a fan of Temperley designs.

She and her sister, Pippa, regularly wear clothes by the British designer who comes up with her creations in a tiny mews house in London's Notting Hill, where she set up her company Temperley London in 2000.

Now, 13 years later, she has turned it into a multi-million pound industry, with 300 outlets in 37 countries.

The Duchess of Cambridge is a repeat customer, wearing Alice Temperley designs at a SportsAid event a fortnight ago, while Temperley famously designed the green backless number worn by Pippa Middleton to her sister's wedding reception.

In an interview this week, Alice described the Middletons as 'lovely girls' adding: 'The Duchess is an inspiration. She's very graceful, gracious and she's a brilliant ambassador for British fashion. She mixes up designer and high street; the perfect modern-day woman.'

Earlier today, William and Kate travelled to South Africa House in central London to honour the former South African president Nelson Mandela.

The Cambridges were watching the UK and European premiere of the film Mandela: Long Walk To Freedom at the Odeon Leicester Square in London when news of the statesman's death broke.

William said after the film: 'It was extremely sad and tragic news. We were just reminded of what an extraordinary and inspiring man Nelson Mandela was and my thoughts and prayers are with him and his family right now.'
