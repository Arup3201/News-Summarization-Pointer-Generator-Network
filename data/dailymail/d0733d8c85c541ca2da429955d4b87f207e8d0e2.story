Russia faces a New Year security nightmare after the second devastating suicide bomb explosion within 24 hours, this time on a rush hour trolley bus in Volgograd. 

The latest blast killed at least 14 with 28 wounded, some severely. 

A day earlier, an explosion reported as being detonated by a female "black widow" suicide bomber saw 17 killed and dozens wounded in the city's main railway station. 

Umarov, 49, is the Chechen jihadist leader blamed for the two suicide bombings in Volgograd in Russia over Christmas

The latest explosion was said by law enforcement officials to have been  caused by a man detonating a bomb in a crowded trolley bus packed with early morning commuters. 

At least 14 people were killed and 28 wounded in the bombing

'The explosives were detonated by a male
 suicide bomber, fragments of whose body have been found and sent for 
DNA testing to identify him,' said Vladimir Markin, spokesman for the 
Russian Investigative Committee, equivalent of the FBI.

'According to preliminary information, 
the explosive device was the equivalent of at least 4 kg of TNT, and 
like the explosive device used at the railway station, it was stuffed 
with metal filings. 

It was not immediately clear why he is suspected. 

The blasts are causing panic in the city, and deep concern all over Russia as people prepare to celebrate the New Year. 

'Since both explosive devices 
contained identical metal filings, this confirms the investigation's 
theory that two terrorist attacks are linked.'

Security
 officials today named a suspected perpetrator of the trolley bus 
explosion as Pavel Pechenkin, from the Volga River republic of Mariy El.

Nobody has claimed responsibility for the blasts, but they underscored vulnerability to bombings and raised fears of attacks by Islamist insurgents whose leader has called on militants to prevent Russia hosting the Olympics

He apparently joined a illegal armed band in spring 2012 after converting to Islam and changing his name to Ansar Ar-Rusi.  

A DNA test is underway to confirm his identity.

President Vladamir Putin held a crisis summit with the country's Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev to discuss the double bombing.

He ordered security
 to be stepped up across all nine time zones in Russia, and especially 
around fear-stricken Volgograd, a city known as Stalingrad in the Soviet
 era. 

President Putin also ordered the head 
of Russian secret services Alexander Bortnikov to fly to Volgograd  amid
 fears of a campaign of terror aimed at disrupting preparations for the 
Sochi Winter Olympics in February.

Sochi is around 425 miles from Volgograd. 

While
 forensic work is underway, security officials already suspect the 
mayhem was unleashed by followers of Chechen rebel leader Doku Umarov 
who earlier this year threatened to hit  civilian targets and urged 
followed to "to their utmost to derail" the Olympics. 

Among the wounded in Monday's blast was a one year old child. 

Television
 footage of the scene, near a market in the Dzerzhinsky region of the 
city, showed debris strewn across the street around the blackened shell 
of the trolleybus.

The vehicle's roof was blown out  by the force of the explosion which also smashed windows in nearby houses. 

Speaking
 to RT, Sergey Avdienko, retired police colonel and former Interpol 
officer, said the attacks are: 'Exactly a part of the same chain, 
including the past explosion in October, the people behind it are the 
same.

'It’s quite clear 
who is behind these attacks – it’s people from a place fairly close to 
Volgograd; I’m speaking about the Caucasus, where radical Islamic groups
 thrive.

'The entire 
point of doing this, especially on the cusp of the New Year, is to 
intimidate the population and to destabilise the situation in the 
country as well, particularly in view of the coming Olympic Games that 
are going to take place in Sochi, which is about 700 kilometers from 
Volgograd.

Tragic: Monday's shocking blast (pictured) came a day after a suicide bombing killed at least 17 people in the same Russian city

'The choice of this place for suicide attacks is obvious.'

The RT also reported that more than 600 people have volunteered to give blood at the Volgograd regional blood bank.

At least 14 people have been killed and 22 injured in an explosion on a packed trolleybus in Russia's Volgograd city

Despite an overabundance of blood, people have continued to volunteer and a queue stretches outside the building.

The Spiritual Administration of Muslims in Moscow is also keen to help and has launched a fundraiser to collect money for the families of the bombing victims.

Volunteers from the administration are also planning to go to Volgograd 'to provide help and moral support.'

The blast was caused by an explosive device in the vehicles passenger cabin, said Russia's National Anti-Terrorism Committee.

The
 railway station blast was initially said to have been caused by a 
Siberian-born woman who was named as Oksana Aslanova who had been 
married to two different Islamists killed in battles with federal 
forces.

The woman was on the federal wanted list and she had been on the run for almost two years. 

Today
 the Investigative Committee said they were also looking at evidence a 
man was closely involved in the devastating "terror act".

Female
 suicide bombers are often referred to in Russia as "black widows" -- 
women who seek to avenge the deaths of their family members in the 
fighting by targeting Russian civilians.

New security measures for Moscow's New Year events have been drawn up.
