Germany is a country known for its passion for fast cars and a love of efficiency.

Not surprising, then, that this coach-load of tourists became very frustrated when they got stuck behind a pensioner on a mobility scooter.

This video, filmed in Edinburgh, shows an elderly man crawling along at 4mph on his scooter in front of a bus full of sight-seers.

'What a race!': An elderly man has been filmed while holding up a coach full of holidaymakers in Edinburgh

Riding along with a hi-vis jacked draped over his seat, the man either doesn't know he's causing a traffic jam, or doesn't care.

With cars already backed up along the other lane there is no opportunity to overtake in sight, the holidaymakers are force to crawl along behind the scooter.

As the empty road stretches away into the distance, one tourist jokes: 'This is what the Germans lost the war for.'

Amid the laughter, another passenger quips: 'This is like Formula 1. What a crazy race! He’s putting up a brave fight.Maybe he will find the accelerator.'

A third man thinks the man has seen them, saying: 'He’s even laughing!'

The five-minute clip was posted online by Edinburgh's Worst Drivers on Wednesday, which aims to name and shame the worst parking and motoring offenders in Scotland's capital.

A spokesman for the site said: 'It’s interesting how these visitors don’t seem to mind being delayed and find it amusing.

'A typical Edinburgh’s Worst Driver would be honking their horn, suffering road rage and trying to overtake.'

As the man shows no sign of pulling over or riding along the pavement, the passengers are forced to sit tight until the procession reaches a roundabout.

As he pulls into the left hand lane the bus driver seizes the opportunity and roars past, much to the joy and relief of his passengers.

An estimated 3.7million tourists stayed in Edinburgh last year, with 57 per cent of them coming from abroad and overall tourists spent £1.1bilion in the city in 2011.

'This is what the Germans lost the war for': the tourists joked among themselves while waiting for the scooter to move out of their way
