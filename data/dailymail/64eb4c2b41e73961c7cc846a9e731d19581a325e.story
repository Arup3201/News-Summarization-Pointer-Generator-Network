A generous waitress has paid the bill of two soldiers who sat down for their lunch break at a New Hampshire restaurant.

Sarah Hoidahl, 21, was working her Wednesday afternoon shift at Ruby Tuesday in Concord when the pair sat down to eat.

They explained to Hoidahl that they were looking for something inexpensive because, due to the government shutdown, they'd been furloughed and were not being paid.

Lunch is on her: Sarah Hoidahl and the note she left two soldiers who sat down to eat at the restaurant she waitresses at

Good deed: Sarah Hoidahl was waiting the table of two soldiers when she decided to pay for their bill

Noted: Instead of their bill, two soldiers received this note from Sarah Hoidahl

When it came time to bring them the bill, which amounted to $30, Hoidahl decided to pay for the New Hampshire National Guard soldiers' lunch out of her own pocket.

'I was kind of like, "I'm going to do a good deed today." And I wrote them a little note,' she told NECN Thursday.

Instead of their bill, the soldiers received a note from Hoidahl that read:

'Thanks to the government shutdown, the people like you that protect this country are not getting paid. However, I still am. Lunch is on me. Thank you for serving ladies! Have a good day!"'

It's not uncommon for New Hampshire National Guard soldiers to stop into the restaurant from their headquarters nearby.

'We
do get soldiers in here quite often, usually they come on their 
lunch breaks. But I had never gotten these two particular ladies 
before.'

Hoidahl, a single mother, is surprised her small act of kindness generated so much interest.

'They were so happy and that was worth it,' Hoidahl told NECN.

'Just seeing the reaction on their face was totally worth it.'

Coincidentally, Hoidahl's manager's mother-in-law Diane Baxter is a chief warrant officer with the National Guard. She saw a picture of the note Wednesday night.

'I was excited to come in this morning and tell General Reddel, my leadership, as well as the public affairs officer,' said Baxter.

'Look right here in Concord we have some really good young people still recognizing us for what we do.'
