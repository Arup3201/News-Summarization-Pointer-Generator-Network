A Good Samaritan who returned a wallet filled with several hundreds of dollars in cash proves that good people do exist.

Joyce Gardner of Waterford, Connecticut found a wallet with $726.00 of cash inside and instead of considering it her lucky day and running off with it she returned it to police and made someone’s holiday much brighter.

Waterford Police said that when Gardner handed the wallet over to authorities she said, 'Tell the woman have a nice Thanksgiving.'

Good Samaritan: Joyce Gardner of Waterford, Connecticut found a wallet with $726.00 of cash inside and instead of considering it her lucky day and running off with it she returned it to police

Police were able to track down the woman who lost her wallet and she told them that the cash was for Christmas presents for her family.

'With all of the ‘bad’ things that go on, we just wanted you to know of something good that we got to help out with, and way to go Joyce Gardner, you really helped out someone!, ' said Waterford police.

'I just saw it and knew with the holidays that someone would need it,' Gardner told Theday.com.

Gardner who is the daughter of a former police sergeant said she didn’t have to think twice before doing the right thing.

'You might think it’s a big deal, but I just did what I thought I should do,' she said.

'I’d expect the same in return, but I know that might not always be the case. I did the right thing and that’s the important thing. It’s something I was taught and I taught my daughters and grandchildren.'

Waterford police Lt. Brett Mahoney said that he'd '“certainly like to think the majority of people are quite honest,' but in reality many people would keep the wallet for themselves.

'It was a sizeable amount of cash,' Mahoney said.

'She did the right thing and as a result she changed someone’s holiday fortunes for sure.' 

Great report: Waterford Police that in lieu of all the bad situations they must deal with a good deed like this one is refreshing and appreciated
