Andrew Beveridge was admitted three times to Victoria Hospital. He begged his wife not to return him there before he died during his final visit

A widow has condemned the 'horrific' treatment of her husband in an NHS hospital where he was left crying in wet nappies.

Grandfather Andrew Beveridge, 80, who was suffering from leukaemia, was forced to wash in a basin when he was first arrived as the showers were not working.

During his second stay he contracted staphylococcus and septicemia after being put in an open ward.

Conditions were so bad he begged his wife Janet not to make him go back a third time during which he contracted a chest infection and died last month.

Mrs Beveridge, 73, said her sobbing husband was left alone in wet nappies on more than one occasion.

She said: 'Andrew used a sheath so that he didn't have to go to the toilet and they didn't have his size in the hospital.

'I packed some for him but nurses failed to do what they were supposed to and I found him crying in wet nappies on two separate occasions.

'It's the indignity of all these little things that upsets me.'

Mrs Beveridge said she had to clean up another patient's urine in another care failure at Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy, Fife.

She said: 'When Andrew was taken into hospital he felt unwell and was told he could lie down on a bed.

'But someone had just got up from the bed and there were bits of food on the table and urine on the floor.

'A nurse changed the bed but my daughter and I had to clean up the other mess. It wasn't a difficult job but it shouldn't have been us doing it.'

Mrs Beveridge also told how she had to pester staff to perform an X-ray on her husband after noticing that his stomach had become swollen.

She said: 'I was really worried about it and said to one of the nurses but she told me not to worry about it.

'My sister had the same thing before she died two years ago so I was concerned about it and asked them to do an X-ray.

'I spoke to Andrew later that evening and he told me he had an X-ray.'

It was the last conversation Janet had with her husband who died in the early hours of January 12.

Janet said the indignities continued 
after his death when she went to the hospital to collect his belongings 
and was told to choose from a number of unmarked brown envelopes.

She said: 'There were carrier bags full of other people's belongings lying on the floor and my daughter was horrified.

'There were no names on any of the envelopes and it was a case of 'take your pick'.

'My husband's expensive Rotary watch was in one of the envelopes and anyone could have taken it.'

When daughter Elaine noticed her father's rings were missing from the envelope she was told they were probably still on his body and they would have to wait two hours until the mortuary opened.

Janet said: 'I know that it was his time but it shouldn't have been the way it was.

'I'm having a meeting with NHS Fife but I don't know what will happen. I expect they will have their excuses ready. I'm just hoping that no other patients have to go through what we have.

'For a whole year, it was just one catastrophe after another and the same things have been happening to other people in the area.

'It's so frustrating. Nothing will bring Andrew back but someone has to try to do something because it isn't good enough.'

NHS Fife confirmed the family had been in touch and a spokeswoman added: 'Once we receive the details of their concerns we will investigate the issues raised.'
