think of him as existing within the animating life that insures 
existence.'

The pop icon – who was born in 
Manchester, North West England – married 33-year-old TV presenter 
Jessica Pacheo, who he met in 2006, in August 2009.

In May 2011, the singer said he was having some of the happiest times he's ever had in his life with Jessica.

He explained: 'We have love. We have 
friendship. She’s also aware of what I’ve done in music, and the fact 
that I no longer really need to prove anything.' 

Davy joined The Monkees in 1965 along
with Micky, Peter and Michael Nesmith – who did not rejoin the group 
for their shows last year – and they went on to record a number of hit 
records including Daydream Believer, Last Train To Clarksville and I'm a
Believer.

Jones was born on December 30, 1945, 
in Manchester, England. His long hair and British accent helped Jones 
achieve heartthrob status in the United States.

Last year, the pop/rock group - who 
were created to appear in their own TV show in the 60s - reformed for a 
45th anniversary tour, but they ended up scrapping some dates amid 
reports of fall outs between the group.

At the time, Micky wrote on his 
Facebook page: 'Dear Fans and Friends, The Monkee Tour has, indeed, been
cancelled but for reasons that I cannot discuss at this time.

Paying tribute: Various celebrities including Eva Longoria, Elijah Wood and Stephen Fry, paid tribute to the singer on Twitter

'I can say
that the reasons pertain to business and are internal matters.

'Needless to say, I am disappointed 
but the situation was unavoidable and I want to apologise to all the 
fans out there who will not be able to experience what was a wonderful 
show indeed. Regretfully, Micky (sic).'

Making a comeback: Jones reformed with the band last year for a UK and U.S. tour, seen here in London in May giving Micky a high five

According to The Monkees website, Monkees.com, Jones left the band in late 1970.

In the summer of 1971, he recorded a 
solo hit Rainy Jane and made a series of appearances on American variety
and television shows, including Love American Style and The Brady 
Bunch.

Jones played himself in a widely 
popular Brady Bunch episode, which aired in late 1971. In the episode, 
Marcia Brady, president of her school's Davy Jones fan club, promised 
she could get him to sing at a school dance.

By the mid-1980s, Jones teamed up with former Monkee Peter Tork, Micky Dolenz and promoter David Fishof for a reunion tour.

Their popularity prompted MTV to re-air The Monkees series, introducing the group to a new audience.

In 1987, Jones, Tork and Micky Dolenz
recorded a new album, Pool It. Two years later, the group received a 
star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

In the late 1990s, the group filmed a special called Hey, Hey, It's the Monkees.

'R.I.P. Davy Jones' is now trending on Twitter with celebrities starting to pay their respects.

Desperate Housewives star Eva Longoria tweeted: 'My heart is sad that my favorite Monkee Davey Jones has passed away! #I'mABeliever'.

And Melrose Place star Lisa Rinna retweeted Eva's message, writing: 'Ditto! He was my 1st crush!'
