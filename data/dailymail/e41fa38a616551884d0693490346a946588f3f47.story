This is the £500,000 in cash that a trucker was attempting to smuggle out of the country in his spare tyres,

Thomas Kent, 45, was jailed after he was stopped by police as he attempted to drive his vehicle transporter onto a ferry in Portsmouth, Hampshire.   

The carrier was loaded with Transit vans and Kent, who worked for Manchester-based haulage firm Motor Movers, claimed they were for a client in the Mondragón area of northern Spain.

This is the £500,000 in cash that Thomas Kent was attempting to smuggle out of the country when he was stopped by Border Force officers 

Thomas Kent, 45, was jailed for five years after being found guilty of attempting to remove criminal property from the UK

Border Force officers became suspicious when they discovered spare tyres in the back of one of the vans that did not fit any of the vehicles. 

Further investigation led to them finding £500,000 stuffed inside three of the mystery wheels.  

Kent of Brighton, East Sussex, denied attempting to remove criminal property from the UK, but was convicted after a trial.

He was sentenced to five years in prison by a judge at Portsmouth Crown Court.

The jury heard the money was likely to have been used to finance drug deals in Spain.

The amount seized was roughly the same as the cost of purchasing 20 kilos of cocaine at wholesale price.

Robert Holness, from the National Crime Agency's Border Policing Command, said: 'This was a significant amount of money and the way it was being transported, concealed within tyres, immediately made us suspicious.

'By seizing this money we have derailed a deal which has kept dangerous drugs off the streets and has prevented criminals making a profit to reinvest in further crimes.'

In a previous trial the boss of Motor Movers, John Tague, 51, from Lancashire, was acquitted of the same charge.

Officers found the money, believed to be destined for Spain, stashed inside the arch of three spare tyres
