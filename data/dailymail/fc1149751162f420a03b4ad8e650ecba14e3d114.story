Things got very steamy this morning at the Today show studios when host Hoda Kotb and TV personality Regis Philbin took part in new charity dare The Twizzler Challenge live on air, and shared a passionate - if very one-sided - kiss.

Hoda, 50, looked as though she got rather more than she bargained for when Regis, 83, energetically took the lead on the act; requiring them to each take opposite ends of one Twizzler, place them in their mouths and nibble the licorice until their lips met in the middle.

When Hoda's quick peck on Regis' lips at the end of the challenge did not seem to satisfy her former NBC co-host, he grabbed her head with both hands and delivered her a passionate smooch, as Hoda froze up in surprise.

Good cause: Much like the now-infamous ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, the Twizzler test has taken off, and benefits Manhattan-based charity New York Collaborates for Autism

Magic moment: The stunt required Hoda and Regis to each take opposite ends of one Twizzler, place them in their mouths and nibble the licorice until their lips met in the middle

Hoda and Regis were officially dared to take on the Twizzler Challenge last week by Today hosts Matt Lauer and Kathie Lee, who themselves shared a series of rather awkward, perfunctory kisses during their on-screen moment.

Once the concept, which aims to raise awareness for autism, was explained to Regis during his guest segment on the show this morning, he enthusiastically asked: 'Are we going to kiss?'

'I'm not sure,' responded Hoda, before timidly spritzing his open mouth with breath spray.

'Let me look at your lips,' Regis exclaimed, leaning in. 'She could swallow me! I've never seen lips like that. Honest to God, something's going to happen.'

And indeed it did.

Hoda nibbled at the licorice straw until she reached Regis' lips, before issuing him a conservative peck.

Not finished: Hoda gave Regis a quick peck, before jerking her head away from him 

Regis then launched in for a full-on smooch, as Hoda darted her head away, only for Regis to grab her back and give her a lingering mouth-to-mouth smacker.

'Boy you look like you went in there!' squealed Kathie Lee, as Hoda recovered in stunned silence.

'It was pretty good,' attested Regis, lipstick smeared over his face. 'You got a boyfriend?'

Much like the now-infamous ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, those who fail to complete the Twizzler test after being nominated have to donate to Manhattan-based charity New York Collaborates for Autism.

Last week at the NBC studios,  Matt Lauer and Kathie Lee were nominated by fellow Today correspondent Meredith Vieira.

Meredith explained that she first took the challenge with Today co-anchor Willie Geist the previous week on her talk show and later donated $5,000 to support autism programs nationwide.

Get away! Hoda tried to push Regis away as he lunged in to take the kiss even further

Recovery: Hoda was visibly shaken after the amorous display, which took place live on air

'This is clearly a transparent attempt by Meredith once gain to make out with her colleague,' Willie joked on the morning show. 

Meredith immediately made it clear that she intended to challenge Matt, but remained coy about who his partner would be. 

'Is there anybody around that we can ask?' Willie said.

Savannah Guthrie, who was sitting next to Matt, quickly left her chair. 

'I am willing to get up out of this seat,' she said as she made room for Matt's partner. 

When Kathie Lee walked on stage, Matt enthusiastically told her: 'Get over here.'

Panic: Ironically, it was Regis who was most concerned about the challenge before it began, telling Hoda that he was worried she would 'swallow him' because of the size of her lips

Kathie Lee joked to Matt: 'Your world is going to be on fire.'

'This is nothing compared to what goes on in the make-up room,' she added. 

As Kathie Lee and Matt sat face to face, they both noted that their awkward encounter was all in aid of a good cause.

'And then we get to challenge somebody,' Matt explained.  

Kathie Lee stared at Matt with her eyes wide open before she started to furiously eat the Twizzler that was in her mouth, quickly moving towards her partner.

'Really aggressive,' Willie commented from the sidelines.

Matt pulled away as Kathie Lee's lips brushed his, only to move back into to give her another kiss.

'I love you anyway,' he said. 'I would have done that for nothing.'

Someone else joked: 'Who the Lady and whose the Tramp?'

After their epic kiss, Kathie Lee nominated her former co-host Regis Philbin and her current co-star Hoda Kotb for the Twizzler Challenge.

After their epic kiss, Kathie nominated Regis and Hoda for the Twizzler Challenge.

But Matt had a different pairing in mind, noting that the cast of Mad Men would be on the show on Monday.

New nominees: Daily Mail Online Editor-at-Large Piers Morgan and Nina Parker also took the challenge on Access Hollywood Live

'I'm available,' Savannah said as soon as the good looking cast was mentioned.

Matt ultimately chose actors Jon Hamm and John Slattery to take on the challenge.

'If John Slattery needs an understudy for that Twizzler Challenge with Jon Hamm, I am available,' Savannah reminded Matt again.

The Twizzler Challenge started earlier this month at Comedy Central's Night of Too Many Stars benefit for autism, which was hosted by Jon Stewart.

When someone on Twitter dared Willie and Orange is the New Black star Uzo Aduba to have a Lady and the Tramp moment with licorice in exchange for a donation, the Twizzler Challenge was born.

Access Hollywood co-hosts Billy Bush and Kit Hoover also took up the same candy-based encounter on their show last Friday before nominating Daily Mail Online Editor-at-Large Piers Morgan and his fellow guest Nina Parker to do the same.

'I got to say that was really enjoyable,' Piers said after they completed the challenge.
