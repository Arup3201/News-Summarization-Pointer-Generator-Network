Women may spend a fortune on anti-wrinkle creams, but it seems we’re more attached to our laughter lines than we thought. A study last month, which retouched the images of 50-somethings to fade their flaws, found that all the women involved preferred pictures in which some wrinkles remained. Can this really be true? We asked three writers in their 50s to look at photos of themselves now and in their 40s, 30s and 20s, and say which they prefer...

MANDY APPLEYARD

Mandy Appleyard, pictured in her 50s, was shocked by old and tired she looks but feels this is the face she deserves given the life she's lead

50s - This is the face that i deserve!

This is worse than I thought. I’m 54, but I’m shocked by how old and tired I look. I can’t really see my eyes for the wrinkles, and the huge crease around my neck makes me look as if I’ve been garrotted.

But this is the face I deserve. I’ve smoked, drunk, burned the candle at both ends, sunbathed, fought off a serious disease, never taken skincare seriously and been hit by life’s slings and arrows: my face tells that story.

But I have no regrets — life is to be lived in the moment. My skin may be wrinkled and tired, but I’m happy in it. Not that I’ll be posing again any time soon!

40s - Tricky years but i'm wearing well

Mandy Appleyard pictured in her 40s

The ageing that I see here is acceptable. The wrinkles are gathering round my eyes like birds round landfill and my eyes are drooping, but I’d say I’m wearing well in this photo — especially since I don’t drink water, rarely use moisturiser and don’t have facials.

My 40s were tricky. A serious relationship broke down, I moved back to the UK from America after falling ill, underwent six months of chemotherapy and did a couple of jobs I hated, so I don’t feel nostalgic for that decade. But I’d be very happy if I looked like this now.

30s - A happy chapter, full of adventure 

Mandy Appleyard pictured in her 30s

Now this picture I like. It’s recognisably me, with some of the creases ironed out. It makes me feel nostalgic for my 30s. I was happiest with my looks in this decade.

I went to live on a boat in California with someone I’d fallen in love with, we got engaged and I fell pregnant for the first time: it was a happy chapter, full of adventure, and which promised the settled relationship and family life I had feared I’d never have.

Here, my face is still young enough to be pleasing, but also has character. This was definitely my heyday.

20s - This just doesn't look like me...

Mandy Appleyard pictured in her 20s

From sublime to ridiculous! This just doesn’t look like me — the familiar flaws and fine lines now as much a part of my face as my eyes and nose are gone.

I was a party girl in my 20s. I worked hard as a journalist in London and Hong Kong, had several unsuitable boyfriends and worked on my suntan when I could. I was reckless — that’s what being young is about. But I wouldn’t want to go back, and I wouldn’t want to look like this.

JULIA STEPHENSON

Julia Stephenson, pictured in her 50s, was horrified by this pictured, wishing she could give her face more volume, she says 'there’s nothing sadder than older women chasing their looks and youth'

50s - The worst photo I've had taken 

I’m quite horrified with this most recent picture.

I was getting over a bad cold, so my face was much more blotchy than usual, but this is still the worst photo I’ve ever had taken.

I just wish I found it easier to put weight on so that my face would have more volume.

I’ve been fairly relaxed about the passing of my youth — I was a plain child and adolescent, so I’ve never depended on looks. Losing them isn’t a big deal.

I don’t bother too much with creams and I hate facials — there’s nothing sadder than older women chasing their looks and youth.

40s - Face of experience, and character 

Julia Stephenson pictured in her 40s

I don’t look so bad in this picture and appear to be holding up reasonably well.

My 40s were a wonderful time, when I started to come into my own. I’d settled down with my long-term boyfriend and home life was very happy for the first time in decades.

I was also having some success as an author and doing charity work with animals and the environment. I had a column in a national newspaper and twice stood as an MP for the Green Party.

I started to have more confidence and felt like I was living life to the full. All of that shows in this face. This is the face of a woman with experience and character.

30s - I spent half of this decade celibate

Julia Stephenson pictured in her 30s

This is a nice picture, but my 30s were tumultuous. My love life was a mess and I was constantly falling for unsuitable men — the man I thought was the love of my life never consummated our relationship, and I later found out he was gay, so I spent half the decade celibate. What a waste.

I wasn’t happy and was always travelling — a way of running away and not facing up to things.

I was constantly embarking on strange diets and going on pointless, expensive spiritual retreats and courses in an attempt to ‘find myself’.

So, I don’t miss my 30s — although I would be very happy to have this face back!

20s - Pretty, but i hated being looked at 

Julia Stephenson pictured in her 20s

This is pretty, but lacks the character of the later pictures. I have no desire to return to this unhappy and frustrating decade, when I hadn’t found what I wanted to do in life.

I settled down with my first boyfriend at 22, married him at 26 and divorced him at 28. In retrospect, I should have lived a bit before settling down. I didn’t even appreciate being pretty.

I resented being constantly looked at. These days, if anyone looks twice I’m delighted!

TESSA CUNNINGHAM 

Tessa Cunningham, pictured in her 50s, was shocked by the toll time, unhappiness and illness had taken on her face

50s - What a shock, but this really is me 

I’m so stunned upon seeing this photo, I tell myself there has been some ghastly mistake. It has obviously been digitally aged by ten years.

But this careworn crone really is me. Although my beauty regime was hit-and-miss when I was young and I’ve occasionally used sunbeds, since I hit 40 I have taken great care of my skin. I slather on factor 50, have facials, have never smoked and don’t drink to excess.

So, what’s gone wrong? I can only put it down to stress and having very pale skin. And the awful truth is that it’s now too late to turn back the clock.

40s - Started on a high but it all fell apart

Tessa Cunningham pictured in her 40s

I love this photo. It’s how I think I still look — a confident woman, comfortable in her (slightly dewy) skin. That’s how I was ten years ago. I started the decade on a high — I had a new husband and two children and was bursting with health.

Then, at 48, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I embarked on surgery, followed by six months of gruelling chemotherapy and radiotherapy. My marriage fell apart — we divorced when I was 51.

I was probably the most unhappy I’ve ever been. I didn’t realise it would catch up with me so visibly.

30s - Life was still full of possibilities

Tessa Cunningham pictured in her 30s

This was the decade when everything came together. I got my first job on a national newspaper, married at 31 and, a year later, had my first baby. My second daughter was born when I was 34.

I adored being a mum, and all of life’s problems (I divorced my first husband when I was 37) still lay in the future.

No wonder I’m free of worry lines here. But I wouldn’t want to step back to this decade, knowing what lay ahead.

Nevertheless, it’s good to be reminded of a period when life was full of so many possibilities — and so little stress.

20s - I wish I'd realised how lucky i was

 

Tessa Cunningham pictured in her 20s

This photo makes me so cross. If I could step back in time, I would give myself a good slap. As I look at this young, attractive woman I wish she’d realised how fortunate she was.

I had so much going for me, yet I squandered this wonderful decade. Eager to find ‘The One’, I threw myself into a series of bad relationships. I wish I had treasured things that mattered — friends and my parents, who are sadly now dead.
