Education secretary Michael Gove, who has now publicly backed free school meals for five to seven-year-olds

Michael Gove has been forced to formally declare the end of hostilities in a row over free school meals. The education secretary now says he passionately advocates the policy.

He had been at war with Nick Clegg and David Laws, his Liberal Democrat ministerial deputy, over free lunches for pupils aged from five to seven.

But in a joint newspaper article today, he and Mr Laws try to laugh off their differences, claiming their image as foes in a disaster movie was wide of the mark and that they are now both firmly behind the idea. The about-turn comes quickly after David Cameron and Mr Clegg ordered them to stop feuding following a series of public briefings against each other.

Conservatives are concerned about the rising costs of the policy, which has been enthusiastically promoted by Deputy Prime Minister Mr Clegg.

Last Friday, private emails showed Mr Gove had warned that giving an extra £80million to help implement the policy risked affecting the quality of teaching and learning. Lib Dem sources branded Mr Gove an ‘ideological zealot’ and Mr Laws, unusually, failed to appear alongside the education secretary in the Commons this week.

But, writing in the Times newspaper, the pair try to bury the hatchet and claim the plan to give free school meals to younger infant pupils at a cost of £1billion, has ‘genuine cross-party support’.

The pair say the policy will be a challenge to implement although most schools seem to be on track.

They played down the whole row, explaining: ‘To judge from the latest breathless headlines, you might expect the two of us to be crouched under our desks like the last survivors in a Bruce Willis movie, only popping out occasionally to blast each other with shotguns.’

They claim the priority of both coalition partners is now ‘improving education not fighting political battles’. They conceded there will be ‘challenges with the implementation of the policy’ which begins across England and Wales in September.

‘Some schools will find it easier than other to expand their catering services to meet this increased demand, but at present the overwhelming majority of schools already seem to be on track’, they said.

They went on: ‘Long after the current political spats are forgotten and our own political careers have ended, this policy will be helping create a generation of young people who are healthier, happier and doing better in their studies.’

‘We are certainly both passionate advocates of this policy and working together we are determined to ensure a successful delivery’, they concluded.

This week Mr Gove’s former special adviser, Dominic Cummings, accused the Lib Dem leader of lying about the funding of free school meals to cover up an ‘abuse of taxpayers’ money’.

At the weekend, the Liberal Democrats hit back, accusing Mr Gove of ‘lunacy’ for draining £400million from key budgets to fill a black hole in funding for his flagship free schools project.

The Education Secretary was called to the Commons on Tuesday to answer an Urgent Question about free schools. In an apparent sign of Coalition tensions, however, Mr Laws did not appear alongside him, as would be customary.

Last night an ally of Mr Gove denied he was told off, saying he felt it was time to ‘move on’.
