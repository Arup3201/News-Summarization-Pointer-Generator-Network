The Duchess of Cambridge and Scarlett Johansson's breasts are scientifically perfect, according to a formula which stipulates the ideal position of the nipples which is backed by a public poll.

Megan Fox, Miranda Kerr, Katy Perry and Kelly Brook are also blessed with the 'perfect' proportions, having an ideally placed 'nipple meridian', a new study has revealed.

The ideal proportions are 45 per cent of the breast above the line of the nipples and a generous 55 per cent below.

This means her nipples point upward at an angle of 20 degrees, creating what is dubbed a 'beckoning breast' according to the research by London-based plastic surgeon Patrick Malluci and reported today in the Sun.

'Beckoning breasts': This is the term given by researcher Patrick Malluci to the kind of breasts that the Duchess of Cambridge and Scarlett Johansson have, where the proportions mean her nipples point upwards at an angle of 20 degrees

Transformers star Megan Fox is also said to have the 'perfect' proportions

Victoria's Secret model Miranda Kerr and singer Katy Perry are also said to be blessed with the 'perfect' pair

Kim Kardashian's top heavy chest is deemed to have the ratio 55:45 - the third most popular in the survey

According to Dr Malluci, of the Royal Free and University College London Hospitals, it is the relative size of the upper and lower halves of breasts that holds the secret of the perfect bust.

He believes the most-appealing female breasts should be only slightly smaller above the nipple than below. 

To support his hypothesis, he asked more than 1,300 people to rank four breast types with different proportions.

The poll found that 87 per cent of respondents ranked breasts of the same 45:55 ratio as Kelly Brook as their favourites.

Dr Mallucci, said: 'In the past, most women have walked into a clinic thinking they’re going to get a couple of round footballs because fullness is a desired look in clothing and women tend to picture themselves dressed.

'But this doesn’t equate to attractiveness in the naked breast. Most surgeons give women what they think they want. 

'And hey presto, plastic surgery gets a bad name for promoting a fake and distorted image.

'I’m not saying women must conform to this ‘ideal’ that works both clothed and naked, it merely gives surgeons around the world a technical and aesthetic roadmap for any women choosing to have breast enhancement to get the best results.'

Second best: Britney Spears's breasts have an equal 50:50 ratio, the favourite of 9 per cent of respondents

Joint last: Lindsay Lohan's top heavy 55:45 ratio breasts, were the favourites of just 2 per cent of respondents, as were Rihanna's pert 35:65s, shown here in a daring awards ceremony gown

It is estimated that between five and 10 million women across the world have had cosmetic breast surgery

Breasts like those of Britney Spears, with an equal 50:50 ratio, were rated top by 9 per cent; 55:45 ratio breasts, like Lindsay Lohan's and Kim Kardashian's, and 35:65s, like Rihanna's, were each the favourites of just 2 per cent of respondents. 

The survey also revealed that more men prefer natural looking breasts than women - in stark contrast to the cliché that men prefer oversized or ‘fake’ breasts. 

Other women whose breasts fit Dr Malluci's 'perfect' template include Caprice Bourret, the underwear model.

But Dr Malluci has said previously that Victoria Beckham's surgically enhanced bust had often been pointed out to him by clients as an example of what they didn't want to end up looking like. 

Dr Mallucci first identified the formula for perfect breasts in 2007 when observing the commonalities of topless models, chosen for their naturally attractive breasts. 

Since then he has championed the adoption of this aesthetic and has urged other surgeons to use the 45:55 ratio as a template for design in breast surgery.  

This golden ratio for breasts is not just a modern phenomenon. 

Throughout history, from the earliest representations of woman to the statues of antiquity, from Renaissance masters to modern photographers, artists have chosen the same proportions.

Venus and Bardot, Aphrodite and Moss, society’s leading ladies have always had 'Beckoning Breast's'.

'Just like beautiful landscapes, everyone agrees on what beautiful breasts look like,' Dr Mallucci added.

'Identifying the 45:55 ideal proportions now gives women the opportunity to tell their surgeons what they really want. 

'I am increasingly seeing women who have finished having children and want to take control of their bodies again. 

'And this is the look that gives them the best results and most satisfaction.'

Separate research has shown recently that breasts are the third thing a man notices in a woman he is meeting for the first time, and that men with more sexist views prefer bigger-breasted women.

Nearly 70 per cent of 1,000 men who took part in the former study insisted that eyes are the first feature of a woman they gaze at.
