David Cameron has revealed how his weekly meetings with the Queen help him to ‘sort out the problems’ in his own head – but doubts she gets much out of it.

The Prime Minister said that after 60 years on the throne, the Queen has ‘literally heard it all before’.

And he revealed the hour-long sessions on a Wednesday evening pass without tea or coffee – or anything stronger.

Mr Cameron meets the Queen every week for an hour, but he admitted he is not sure she gets anything out of their chats

Prime Minister David Cameron today lifted the lid on his weekly chats with the Queen during a Q&A session at United Utilities in Warrington

Prime Ministers are granted an ‘audience’ with the monarch every week, when Parliament is sitting, to update the head of state on the major issues the country faces.

But speaking during a Q&A session in Warrington today, Mr Cameron admitted that there is nothing left to shock or surprise the Queen, who has been served by a dozen prime ministers.

He told staff at United Utilities in Warrington: ‘It is one of the great privileges of my job. I see Her Majesty every week when Parliament is sitting. But there is no cups of tea, no cups of coffee, nothing stronger.

‘It is probably one of the most valuable hours that I have because when you think of her Majesty, I am her 12th Prime Minister.

‘She started with Winston Churchill and she has literally heard it all before.’

When the Queen meets the Prime Minister there is no-one else in the room, and there is no official record made of what is said.  

Mr Cameron told apprentices that his audiences with the Queen help to clear his head, but they drink nothing stronger than coffee

As part of his tour this morning, Mr Cameron stopped off for a coffee at the Buttonwood services on the M62, where he was recognised by some onlookers

Mr Cameron said he found the chance to discuss domestic and international problems and challenges with someone outside the political process ‘an incredibly useful exercise’.

But he admitted that the Queen might be slightly less enthusiastic about the experience.

‘I am not sure it is always of huge benefit to her, but it is of great benefit to me,’ Mr Cameron said.

‘Because I find it helps sort out the problems in my own head about the things we need to do.

‘I think she is the most amazing public servant. I think we are so lucky to have a symbol of national unity that we do in our royal family and to have someone who has fulfilled that role so magnificently for all these years.

‘It is hard to think of a time when she has ever put a foot wrong.

‘I think she is an absolutely magnificent person in the work she does. It is a privilege to spend a bit of time with her.’
