A World War II soldier's heartfelt letter to the daughter he never met has finally reached her, seven decades after it was written, along with his military honors.

Peggy Eddington-Smith received the letter penned by her father, Pfc. John Eddington, as well as his Bronze Star and Purple Heart medals, during an emotional ceremony Saturday in Dayton, Nevada.

The father, who never made it home, sent the three-page letter shortly after she was born and shortly before he died in Italy in June 1944. He sent it while stationed in Texas, just before he was sent overseas.

Honored: Peggy Eddington-Smith received her father's medals during the ceremony, such as this Purple Heart. Earlier she received a heartfelt letter from the soldier, professing his love for his newborn daughter

Getting his medals was nice, but the letter meant more because it made her feel closer to her father, Eddington-Smith said.

She knew little about him since her mother could rarely bring herself to discuss the love of her life. 'The letter gave me more knowledge of who he was,' she told The Associated Press.

'He poured out his heart to me, and a lot of men don't put that kind of emotion in writing. I'm just overwhelmed by everything, trying to absorb everything.'

Donna Gregory of St. Louis found the soldier's letter and other World War II memorabilia in a box 14 years ago while helping her then-husband clean out his grandparents' home in Arnold, Missouri.

Gregory's voice cracked with emotion as she read the letter Saturday, bringing tears to Eddington-Smith and many in the crowd of about 150.

The soldier devoted the first page to his wife, saying he hoped she did not find it 'silly' that he was writing a letter to a child who could not read.

Addressing the next two pages to his 'darling' daughter, he wrote that while she may not see him 'for some time,' he wanted her to know that she was always on his mind.

'I love you so much,' the letter says. 'Your mother and daddy ... are going to give you everything we can. We will always give you all the love we have.'

Eddington urged his daughter to 'always treat your mother right. You have the sweetest mother on the Earth.'

He closed the letter by writing, 'I love you with all my heart and soul forever and forever. Your loving daddy.'

Seven decades later Peggy Smith is about to get his Purple Heart medal and an emotional letter the father she never met wrote just weeks after her birth

Eddington-Smith and Gregory are 
unsure what connection the soldier had to the couple who owned the house
where his memorabilia was found.

Eddington was from Leadwood, Missouri, about 75 miles southwest of Arnold, a suburb of St. Louis.

Gregory tracked down Smith in June after a search that involved libraries and the Internet.

She sorted through several 
letters, including the War Department's message to Eddington's mother 
about his death in Italy in June 1944, four months after his daughter's 
birth.

At the bottom of the box she found the Purple Heart, the medal 
awarded to members of the Armed Forces wounded or killed in action.

Gregory then spent the next 14 years in libraries and on the 
Internet trying to track down the elusive daughter. She called every 
Eddington in Missouri, trying to find the right Peggy. No one could 
help.

Earlier this year she enlisted the help 
of friends and began reaching out on Facebook, leading to a breakthrough - she found Peggy Smith.

Both women cried during their initial phone conversation that left the daughter shocked by the items' discovery.

Eddington-Smith
knew her father died in the war. She was unaware of the letter and 
other contents of the box.

This included 16 letters from Eddington to his 
mother, his draft card and military dog tags, his high school diploma 
and newspaper clips.

An 
only child, she grew up in St. Louis and lived there until her mid-20s. 
She moved with her four children to Nevada in 1972 after a divorce. Her 
mother, Helen, never remarried and died in 1997.

'I
would ask my mother why she didn't get remarried and her only comment 
was that she found the perfect man and will never again find the perfect
man,' Eddington-Smith said.

'My
mom didn't tell me much about my dad,' she added. 'I think she was 
just distraught. She was so much in love with him.

'I learned as a young 
girl not to bring it up because she would just get so upset.'
