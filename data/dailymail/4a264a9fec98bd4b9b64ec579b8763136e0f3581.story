Ashya King's father claims he was 'treated like a criminal' when he returned to Britain for the first time three months after fleeing the country with his cancer-stricken son.

Brett King, who has been by Ashya's bedside while he receives proton beam therapy in the Czech capital Prague, said Border Force officials took his and his older son's passports at Gatwick Airport.

They then made the pair wait in a holding area while they phoned other authorities and called in two uniformed police officers - who later decided to let the father and son go.

'Treated like a criminal': Ashya King's father Brett (pictured) was stopped by border agency staff at Gatwick Airport on Saturday as he attempted to return to the Britain for the first time since fleeing with his son

Argument: Footage of the encounter was posted on YouTube by Mr King's older son Naveed. He said both of their passports (bottom right) were confiscated by staff who called police before letting them walk on

Treatment: Ashya (pictured) has now returned to his parents' home in Spain and is said to be doing well 

The incident was filmed on a smartphone on Saturday by Mr King's older son Naveed and uploaded to YouTube today.

The two-and-a-half minute clip began with an angry Mr King, 51, sitting in a holding area at passport control.

He told how he and Naveed had their passports seized when they arrived and were asked to wait in a holding area while police made 'phone calls and that sort of thing'.

'I was told that there would be no problem if I came back to England,' he told the camera. 'But already... I'm having problems.' 

When he was called to speak to two police officers, he told them: 'How would you feel, coming back into your own country and you are treated like a criminal?

'What have I done except help my son?'

Giving up: Mr King, 51, tried to look at border force computer records on him before walking off to arrivals

Followed: Mr King headed for an escalator (left) where the officers told his son to stop filming them (right)

A police officer told him he would not be arrested, but Mr King demanded to see what information was held about him on the Border Force computers.

'I'm not going to follow you, you'll have to arrest me,' he told the officer. 'I want to see what's on the computer screen first. I don't like to be treated like this in public'.

'You're not making demands', the police officer replied. 'It's not my computer system.'

The father and son then walked off, continuing to film the two police officers as they ascended an escalator towards baggage reclaim.

One of the two officers then asked: 'Can you put that away?'

'What's your name sorry?' asked Naveed.

The police officer said again: 'Put your camera away.'

Family: Mr King, 51, and his wife Naghmeh (right) sparked an international manhunt in August after removing Ashya (pictured) from Southampton General Hospital without the permission of medical staff

Mr King and his wife Naghmeh sparked an international manhunt when they removed five-year-old Ashya from Southampton General Hospital on August 28 without medical consent.

Under the belief that British doctors were not taking the best course of treatment for their son, they fled to Spain with the sickly five-year-old in their care. 

Police traced the couple to Malaga and arrested Mr and Mrs King, holding them in a Spanish jail at the request of British authorities.

Ashya was put in hospital under armed guard and was unable to see his parents for days. 

Then, in a dramatic turnaround amid a national outcry, the parents were told they would not face charges.

Brave: Ashya King pictured at the Proton Therapy Centre in the Czech capital Prague at the end of October

Their son was taken for 30 rounds of experimental treatment at the Proton Therapy Centre (PTC) in Prague and is now recuperating with the family in Spain.

Two weeks ago Mrs King said said her son was 'improving every day'.

She told ITV: 'He’s so much, so much better now and we’re really happy with him, the fact that he’s saying a few words as well.'

A Sussex Police spokesman told MailOnline: 'Two uniformed constables who were on routine patrol in the airside area were called by the UK Border Agency to advise on an issue relating to a passport held by an arriving passenger in immigration arrivals on Saturday 29 November.

'When the officers arrived they quickly confirmed to border staff that police had no interest in the matter. One of the officers spoke briefly to [Mr King] and he walked through to landside.

'The officers made it clear to the man that they did not intend to arrest him. We have received no complaint about the actions of the police, and media enquiries about the reason why border force called police will need to be made to the Home Office.'

MailOnline has contacted the Home Office for comment.
