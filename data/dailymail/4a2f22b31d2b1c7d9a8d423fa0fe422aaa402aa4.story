A bride-to-be refused to walk down the aisle until her fiance paid £4000 for her to have breast enlargement surgery.

Rochelle Bathew, 22, had never been happy with her natural 32B-sized frame.

After breastfeeding her two children, she hated her figure even more - saying her 'saggy and lifeless' breasts made her 'depressed'.

The mother-of-two's partner Ryan, the couple pictured together at their March wedding, paid almost £4,000 for his wife-to-be to have surgery

Mrs Bathew, 22, said she wanted to look her best for her wedding day - hence why she wanted surgery

Three months after the surgery, the couple married and Mrs Bathew now says she couldn't be happier

Mrs Bathew has now become an Instagram sensation setting up a dedicated account to her new features

So the mother-of-two from Derby told her fiance Ryan she would not walk down the aisle until he paid for her to have surgery. 

Eventually, the teacher paid for the full-time mother to increase her breasts to a 30FF.

Three months later, the couple married - and the newlywed says she couldn't be happier.

Mrs Bathew has
 even become an Instagram sensation after setting up an account dedicated 
to photos of her new features.

She said: 'I’d always hated my small boobs, but after I had my two children, they were saggy too - they looked like a Cocker Spaniel’s ears.

Mrs Bathew said her breasts (pictured) - which she says were 'saggy and lifeless' - used to make her 'depressed'

'I did everything I could to hide them, and there is no way I was going to walk down the aisle with everyone looking at me in a dress like that.

'Some people have said I’m vain, but I don’t mind admitting that - I want to look my best for my husband.

'They did make me feel insecure, but it wasn’t simply vanity that made me have surgery - I wanted to be a stunning bride.

'Ryan knew how much I wanted bigger boobs, and I knew he’d buy them for me - he just wanted me to be happy on my wedding day.'

Mrs Bathew fell pregnant for the second time in 2012 and breast fed both her children.

The full time mother has now become an online sensation after posting pictures of her new breasts on Instagram (her page pictured)

The mother says she: 'Set up the Instagram page (pictured) so that other women could see what I¿ve achieved'

Mrs Bathew set up her Instagram account to show other women what can be achieved if there is something they don't like about themselves

She said: 'They were saggy and lifeless, it made me feel depressed when I saw other girls with big boobs, they always seemed happy and confident.

'Ryan turned to me one day and said, "if we’re going to get married soon then you’ll need to get a boob job."

'I knew he loved me as I was but equally he wanted to see me happy.'

The couple booked an appointment to see a cosmetic surgeon at MYA Plastic Surgery Clinic in Birmingham.

Rochelle said: 'Ryan paid for my surgery, it was my wedding gift, they cost him £3950.

'He wanted me to look my best just as much as I did.

'In December 2013 my dream came true - I went from a deflated, uneven 32B to a 30FF.'

Mrs Bathew underwent surgery on December 14 last year. The breast enlargement was a gift from her new husband Ryan, pictured right

Mrs Bathew had her operation on December 14th and it took just three months for her to fully recover. The couple married on March 1 this year.

She said: 'Our wedding was perfect - we hired a stately home and my big white dress looked amazing.

'We had a mini-moon afterwards where we spent a few days at a spa - any excuse to get a bikini on.

'Having your boobs done takes courage, fair play to anyone who changes something they don’t like.

'I view surgery like most girls view fake eye lashes, it really isn’t a big deal.

'Since having my boob job I have set up an Instagram page for my new twin girls, I have named them Heidi and Audrini from The Hills.

'I set up the instagram page so that other women could see what I’ve achieved - my motto is, if you don’t like something about yourself, change it!

'My page consists of my before and after pictures, images of underwear and my general progress.'
