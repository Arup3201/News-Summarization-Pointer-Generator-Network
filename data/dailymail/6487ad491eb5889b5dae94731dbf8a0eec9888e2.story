Charged: Leroy Smith III, from Maine, is accused of murdering his father

A man who wrote on his Facebook page that he was God and the head of racist organization the Klu Klux Klan has been charged with murdering his father.

Leroy Smith III, 24, is accused of killing Leroy Smith Jr, 56, after his remains were discovered on Monday morning in wooded ground near to the apartment they shared on the outskirts of Gardiner, Maine.

The State Medical Examiner said that Mr Smith Jr had died from ‘multiple sharp force injuries’.

Police believe that he murdered his father inside the apartment and dragged the body to the woods.

It’s understood that Mr Smith Jr took his son in several months ago after he was evicted from an apartment in Westborough, Massachusetts, for unruly behavior that caused deep concern among other tenants and the landlord.

Police Chief Alan Gordon, from Gardiner Police Department, told the Morning Sentinel that on one occasion Smith III set his guitar and amplifier alight in the apartment’s backyard because ‘he believed they were emitting evil music’.

Smith III used a picture of burnt musical equipment for his Facebook profile picture.

He was subsequently served with a protection against harassment order, which he apparently broke just 24 hours later, leading to a warrant for his arrest.

His father allowed him to move in with him but was very uneasy about the situation.

Close friend Michael Parady said: ‘He said, “I sleep with one eye open.’”

Mr Parady shared Mr Smith’s Jr’s nervousness, adding: ‘I was very concerned about his son living with him.’

Smith III’s Facebook page contains numerous rants, including some that are delusional. One post reads: ‘I am God. I hate you all, you never see the truth.’

Another states ‘go to Hell anyone on Earth’, while some contain racist outbursts.

In one message he declares that he’s the ‘head of the KKK’.

He was arrested after asking police in Gardiner for directions. Officers performed a background check and discovered that he was wanted for failing to appear in court for a hearing about the harassment order.

Smith III eventually revealed where his father's body was, police said.
