Two holidaymakers got the shock of their lives while taking a dip in Florida this week.

People high up in a penthouse at the Silver Beach Towers in Destin, near Fort Walton Beach, spotted a shark approaching the couple.

But despite screams and calls from the balcony for them to 'get out of the water', the pair did not hear.

Video of the terrifying incident surfaced online this week.

Terrifying: These two swimmers in Destin, Florida, came dangerously close to a shark earlier this week, which they did not realize was circling near them

Closer: The couple, who are in that is a little deeper than their knees, did not hear shouts of warning from people on the shore

Run: It is only after after the shark - believed to be a hammerhead - breaks the water that the pair run for it

Safe: It is believed the shark was hunting a stingray

According to the people recording, the shark is a hammerhead.

Luckily for the swimmers, it appears to be hunting a nearby stingray.

However the shark comes extremely close to the pair without them noticing.

It is only when the suspected hammerhead causes a store in the water that the two realize what is happening right next to them.

Much to the relief of the people filming, the couple then quickly run from the water, which is only knee-deep.

Back out to sea: The shark moves to deeper water, appearing to have the stingray in its mouth

The shark then heads back out into the deep, appearing to have caught the stringray.

Hammerheads can grow up to 20 feet long and of the 11 different species, only three have been known to attack humans, according to The New York Daily News.
