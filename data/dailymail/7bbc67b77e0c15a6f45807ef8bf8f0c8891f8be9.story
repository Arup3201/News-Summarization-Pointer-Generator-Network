This is the moment the wildlife became the photographer as a badger appeared to get behind the camera in a British garden. 

The yearling badger was captured on film inquisitively climbing on to the camera and posing as if it were about to take a photo of its own.

The incredible images were all taken in a back garden in Loughborough, Leicestershire.

The young badger cub climbed on the camera equipment and appeared to take a photo of its own

Talented amateur photographer Daniel Belton, 34, took the pictures in the garden of his parents' home.

He said: 'The badgers have been coming to us for about five years or so now. We've never tried to tame them but we do feed them occasionally.

'I try to make sure they are still as wary of us as possible because it wouldn't be good for them to be too used to humans.

'We have about five or six adults at the moment, after they had a batch of cubs last year.'

At one point it looked as though the  cub was fiddling with the camera settings as it climbed on the equipment

Mr Belton said he did have a favourite among the badgers - the aptly-named Mrs Badger, who is the matriarch of the group.

He said: 'The badger behind the camera was a yearling, I had put peanut butter on the back of the camera with that picture but I was still thrilled when a badger finally got into position and looked as though it was fiddling with the settings.

Mr Belton also took some candid shots of the badgers exploring his parents' garden, like this one showing three badgers climbing a tree

'Because we live in a town we only get the badgers visiting after dark so you have to use some light source. I used to use flash and shoot by remote but now in most of the pictures I use a lamp and hand hold the camera. 

'Even with that you are pushing the camera to the limit, what with the badgers being nocturnal, which means it can be frustrating especially with action shots.'

The badgers have been visiting the Loughborough garden at night for several years
