Political commentators took issue with the fact that the design 'cost more
 than the average American family makes in a month'

Michelle Obama has once again stepped out in her $6,800 J Mendel jacket, despite fielding a backlash last time she wore the pricey garment.

The First Lady looked suitably festive as she joined her family yesterday for the taping of TNT's Christmas in Washington at the National Building Museum.

But the last time she wore the embellished garment, in July 2012 at a Buckingham Palace reception in London, political commentators took issue with the fact that she had spent so much on fashion while so many in the U.S. are suffering financially.

High-end fashion statement: Michelle Obama wore a $6,800 J Mendel jacket yesterday, despite fielding a backlash last time she wore the garment. The First Lady was at the taping of TNT's Christmas in Washington

Distraction: Despite any impending controversy over Mrs Obama's outfit, the first family was in high holiday spirits at the charity event as some little Christmas elves entertained them with their mischievous antics

A post on the Gateway Pundit blog remarked that the design 'cost more than the average American family makes in a month ($4,284)'.

'She does this as Americans continue 
to suffer through a deep recession and record unemployment,' writer Jim 
Hoft said. 'Michelle feels your pain.'

Regardless of the criticism, the 
ensemble was deemed a sartorial hit by style watchers, who had nothing 
but praise for the all-white look.

The jacket, which is almost armor-like
 in style, is embroidered in shimmering silver. The cap sleeves show 
off those famously toned arms, while the high neckline keeps the look demure.

Styling it well: The lightweight fabric of the sharply-pleated skirt makes for a soft contrast, while the silver pumps add polish, and co-ordinate with the look perfectly

The repeat appearance of the J Mendel resort 2013 jacket yesterday gives it a cost-per-wear figure of $3,400. But if one were in the market for such an item, they would be out of luck - it no longer appears to be available to buy.

Despite any impending controversy over Mrs Obama's outfit, the first family was in high holiday spirits at the charity event as some little Christmas elves entertained them with their mischievous antics.

During a photo op, the President and his family were in stitches as young former patients from the Children's National Medical Center made hilarious faces at the camera.

It was a high point among many at the star-studded annual event, which was hosted this year by Hugh Jackman and featured performances by Sheryl Crow, Janelle Monae and the Backstreet Boys among others.

Exclusive access: The jacket was originally available to pre-order at Moda Operandi, but if one were in the market for such an item today, they would be out of luck - it no longer appears to be on sale anywhere

Before the concert began, Obama, his 
wife, Michelle, and daughters, Sasha, 12, and Malia, 15, helped collect presents 
for patients at Children's National Medical Center in Washington. Mrs. 
Obama's mother, Marian Robinson, watched from nearby.

'I
 want to thank our host Hugh Jackman for keeping our safety in mind by 
leaving Wolverine's claws at home,' the president joked.

'It can't be easy to wrap presents with those things; good for carving up roast beast though,' Obama continued.

Sasha and Malia, fast becoming fashion forces in their own right, also stood out in monochrome hues last night.

Good fashion game: Malia (left) wore a cream asymmetric cable-knit sweater with a high-waisted tulle skirt, while Sasha (right) went for a black-and-white lace-print dress with patterned tights and silver Asos Oxfords

Malia wore a cream asymmetric cable-knit
 sweater with a high-waisted tulle skirt, co-ordinating with her mother,
 while Sasha went for a black-and-white lace-print dress with patterned 
tights and silver Asos cut-out Oxfords.

Other performers at the concert included actress Anna Kendrick and Pat Monahan, the singer from the band Train.

Retired NBA star Charles Barkley also was on hand to talk about programs at Children's National.

The show will air Friday, December 20 on TNT.
