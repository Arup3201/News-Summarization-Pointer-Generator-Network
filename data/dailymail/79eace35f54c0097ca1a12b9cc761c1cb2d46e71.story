A teenager who had all of her limbs amputated after contracting a rare form of meningitis has returned to her home following a lengthy hospital stay.

Kaitlyn Dobrow was struck down with the often-fatal bacterial infection meningococcemia in February and though she survived, she had both arms and legs removed.

The 19-year-old has undergone 20 surgeries since receiving the initial diagnosis- where doctors said she had only a week to live.

Happy day: Kaitlyn Dobrow, 19, has been released from the hospital and was interviewed by a local news reporter who held a picture that Dobrow painted following her amputations

Her recovery has been documented by her supportive friends and family who have posted photos online and even arranged for a very special pick-me-up in the hospital.

Actor John Stamos visited Dobrow at the Orange County hospital in August after being recruited by her friend.

He smiled and posed for photos, promising to take Dobrow to Disneyland once her health improved.

That day out may come sooner than expected as local reporter Vikki Vargas posted a photo standing next to Dobrow in her family's home after being released Thursday.

Famous friends: Dobrow's friends reached out to John Stamos and he visited her in the hospital

Star treatment: John Stamos visited meningitis victim Kaitlyn Dobrow at her Orange County Hospital in California along with her friend Kristen Kidd and promised to take her to Disneyland

The reporter even held a painting of Simba, the star of Disney's The Lion King, that Dobrow completed after her amputations.

Dobrow has remained remarkably positive and is very optimistic about the future, already making strides towards independence.

'Eventually I’ll be able to do anything. I’ve already been fitted for my prosthetic and legs,' she told NBC Los Angeles.

The
strand of meningitis that she contracted first displayed itself with 
flu-like symptoms making the eventual decision to amputate her limbs 
even more shocking to Dobrow and her family.

'You
get to the point where you have no control. You know it’s in His hands 
you have to trust Him and we’re able to do that,' her mother Kathi told 
the station.

Now, aside from her date with the former Full House star, Dobrow has months of rehabilitation ahead of her.
