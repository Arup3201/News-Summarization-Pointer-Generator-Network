Dozens of young people have been seen risking death or potential serious injury by playing 'chicken' at a level crossing. 

CCTV footage shows youngsters jumping over barriers at Grays level crossing in south Essex when they are down because a train is about to approach, and racing over the tracks.

Others have been seen risking their lives by walking along the tracks to get to the exits or jumping off the platform.

People have been captured on video racing over a level crossing at Grays in Essex, before barriers close 

In the last month alone 260 incidents have been recorded and police are calling for people to pay more attention to their safety on the crossing, rather than risk death by taking foolhardy shortcuts or playing 'chicken' as they race to beat the barriers. 

Authorities said if incidents continue they will have to consider closing the crossing because the number of people putting themselves at risk is 'simply too high.' 

More than 100 trains use the crossing every single day. 

Steve Cassidy, Network Rail area director, told the Clacton Gazette: 'It may be tempting to shave a minute or two off your journey but this a busy main line and people are putting their lives at risk by walking on the track or trying to beat the barriers.

Police and train officials have warned the crossing could be closed if people keep risking their lives 

Some people may think that taking a shortcut along the tracks isn't really a risk, that they can get out of the way of the train but fatality figures show that isn't the case. Waiting at a crossing can sometimes be frustrating but ignoring safety measures can result in tragic consequences, something we want to prevent.' 

In one piece of footage youngsters are seen ducking under the barriers and racing across the crossing before a train comes while another rides a bike across the closed section. 

Another clip shows a passenger walking along the tracks after a train has left to exit the station.

Police said they will increase patrols at the crossing over the next few weeks to try and prevent as many people as possible using it in a risky way. 

Council leader Councillor John Kent said: 'Network Rail has made it clear that – as a last resort – they may have to close the crossing, simply shut it down. I do not want that to happen. But everyone who uses it must play their part too.' 

British Transport Police said it will be cracking down on people who misuse the level crossing, endangering their own lives and that of other people. 

Mark Hook said: 'Is it really worth risking a criminal record, or even your life, just to save a few minutes on your journey?'
