Japan has ordered missile units to shoot down a long-range rocket expected to be launched by North Korea next month if it enters its air space.

The Unha-3 rocket is expected to fly past western Japan after its launch from North Korea’s west coast sometime between April 12 and 16.

This has raised concerns that it could endanger Japanese lives or property.

Defence Minister Naoki Tanaka today said Japan would respond if that is the case, following a meeting of the country’s national security council.

Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura urged people to stay calm, saying the military is preparing 'just in case'.

A statement from the Defence Ministry said Japan would send destroyers equipped with Aegis missile defence systems to the Pacific and East China Sea and deploy mobile Patriot missile launchers to islands in Okinawa.

An interceptor missile unit is also likely to be deployed in Tokyo, although the capital is far from the expected flight path.

North Korea has said the aim of the launch is to send a satellite into orbit. But Japan, the U.S. and other countries claim it is also seeking to test the capabilities of its long-range missiles, in violation of international agreements.

Seoul has also warned it might shoot down any parts of the North Korean rocket heading for South Korean territory.

Japan
 mobilised its interceptor units and issued a similar warning to North 
Korea before a rocket launch in 2009, but did not follow through.

Interceptor
 missiles on the Japanese destroyers would serve as the first line of 
defence, and the land-based Patriot missiles would be a backup.

Japan has successfully tested its interceptor missiles, but has never used them in a real-world situation.
