It was the day before Everton's return to Europe and Phil Jagielka was holding court in the media auditorium at Finch Farm.

A naturally bubbly character, Jagielka was in high spirits as he focused on the imminent clash with Wolfsburg but it was only a matter of time before he knew the topic of conversation would change. He would have to confront a difficult summer and testing start to the new campaign.

'A little bit sticky,' was how he chose to describe the last four months. It was, perhaps, an understatement. Having been in the firing line for England's World Cup demise and scrutinised for the poor goals Everton had been conceding, lesser souls might have found it all too much.

Phil Jagielka is not one to shy away from pressure, and has faced a difficult period admirably

Jagielka, though, is not someone who will ever hide. He is a character who will face up to issue and however hard he found the questions, he answered them impressively. He fights and doesn't give in.

That is why, in the 91st minute of the 223rd Merseyside derby, he was scuffling around the edge of Liverpool's penalty area, trying to find a way of helping his team salvage something from a game that was slipping away.

How Everton's captain delivered.

Latching on to a headed clearance from Dejan Lovren, Jagielka crashed volley from 25 yards into the top corner of The Kop net, to leave Anfield – bar one delirious Blue corner – in stunned silence. It was, undoubtedly, the most spectacular goal scored by an Everton player behind enemy lines since Graeme Sharp's howitzer in 1984.

Seasons, both individually and collectively, can be transformed in such dramatic moments and so high was the quality of the goal, Roberto Martinez labelled it the best he had seen at a live game.

'We pushed up a little bit and there was an opportunity about five minutes before when I elected to pass and I thought if one comes across again I'll swing one at it and thankfully the swinging worked,' Jagielka said modestly.

'It's been a frustrating season so far and to go one-nil down and to keep knocking at the door the way we did shows tremendous character. A point is decent, we'd have loved three. But we've got to make sure we keep the character strong because right now we're not picking up the right results.'

Jagielka's performance, in front of England manager Roy Hodgson, may go some way to restoring his international place

Everton did not play well yesterday but, at the back, the combination of Jagielka and John Stones was solid and their respective performances would have been noted by England head coach Roy Hodgson, who was sat observing in the Directors' Box.

Jagielka accepts he is no longer a first choice for England, given he was dropped for the recent games against Norway and Switzerland, but if he keeps playing in this manner, both club and country will feel the benefit. This has to be a catalyst for revival.

'We've performed ok but the results haven't shown it,' said Jagielka. 'So it's about the lads to come out and keep playing the way we are and keep having the courage to do the right things and hopefully they'll turn around.'

He is proof of that.
