Jayden and Gemma Field were forced to return from their honeymoon after Lottie was run over by a car

A couple were forced to return from their honeymoon when their two-year-old daughter was injured in a hit and run.

Gemma and Jayden Field had just arrived in the Portuguese Algarve when they learned Lottie, their toddler daughter, and her grandmother had been hit by a car. 

The child suffered injuries to the head and ear, while Mrs Fields's mother broke her shoulder in the accident in Sandwell, West Midlands. 

Police are appealing for information about the incident which took place two days after the couple's dream wedding. 

The driver, a woman driving a dark green BMW, fled the scene before officers arrived on September 22.  

'Lottie and my mum could easily have been killed,'  said Mrs Field. 

'When we found out it was horrendous. Me and Jayden were absolutely distraught - we didn't know what to do or where to go.

'I understand the driver becoming intimidated as people had gathered around saying "what have you done".

'What I can't get my head around is why she hasn't got in touch with the police.'

Mrs Field's mother, Lorraine Clulow, acted as a human shield for her granddaughter when she noticed the car approaching them.   

'I can't stop thinking if I hadn't held on to Lottie she'd have ended up under the car.

'I saw the car coming from the corner of my eye and just ripped her off my hip and held on to her hand for dear life. 

'The driver got out of the car and said something like "are you alright, love?", but I couldn't look up - I was too distraught.

'I really don't know how anyone can drive away from a situation like that.

'I'm furious because of the distress she's caused the whole family.

'Not only did she hurt me, but worse she injured the granddaughter I had in my arms.'

A spokesman for West Midlands Police said: 'A 51-year-old pedestrian and her two-year-old grandchild were struck by a car on the High Street at just after 10am.

The toddler was left with head and neck injuries after the incident. Her injuries may have been worse if her grandmother had not acted as a human shield and protected her from the car

The 51-year-old was left with a fractured shoulder and bruising on her legs and feet. She said she could not believe the driver fled the scene without giving her details 

The couple celebrated their wedding just two days before the horrifying incident in Sandwell, West Midlands 

'They both suffered fractures to their shoulders.

'The driver of the car stopped at the scene to check the pedestrians were OK before leaving without giving her details.

'Inquiries are on-going to trace this woman, who is described as around 6-years-old with white hair and glasses.

'She was driving a green old-style BMW.

'Anyone with information should call police on 101.'
