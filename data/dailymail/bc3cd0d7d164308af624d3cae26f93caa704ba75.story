She's beautiful, giving and from the look of her airbrushed - and unretouched shots - Petra Nemcova is naturally absolutely flawless.

No wonder the 5ft 10in Czech-born model, 35, has been announced as the new face of Ultimo underwear's spring/summer 2015 campaign.

She replaces a pregnant Abbey Clancy, and it's evident from her pictures that she needs no improvement.

She's 35 and still killing it! Petra Nemcova stripped down to her undies in a new ad campaign for British lingerie company, Ultimo. The Czech supermodel wore a black lace bra with ribbon detailing and matching high waisted briefs on her slender, almost six foot frame.

A huge hit in the UK, Ultimo rose to popularity thanks to their bust enhancing bras designed with a silicone gel to amplify those lacking in the cleavage area. Their styles range from classic bra and panty sets to frilly knickers and even swimwear.

Sadly, the Black Label Sophia set is not available in the US, but we scooped up a stylish alternative from the brand at ASOS in our edit. If that's not enough, check out our other finds from Charlotte Russe and Forever 21 starting at $15.

The new campaign features Petra showing off a series of stunning designs which are available in sizes A to G cups, priced from £12 for briefs and £24 for bras.

The pictures have been released just in time for Valentine's Day.

Petra said: 'I’m thrilled to be the new face of Ultimo, following in the footsteps of so many beautiful women. 

'I adore Ultimo lingerie – it feels amazing on the skin and is incredibly stylish and seductive.'

In one shot, Petra poses in the Black Label Sophia set of vintage-inspired lace and sheer bra, £35, and matching high-waisted knickers, £18.

The picture is shot against a wood panelled wall, with a Champagne-coloured shrug falling seductively off her shoulder.

Ultimo released both the picture of Petra before the picture was retouched and afterwards. The most remarkable thing about the two images is their sheer similarity. 

While the colour is brighter in the 'after' image and her skin tone and hair appear warmer, Petra's body and her proportions appear to be exactly the same.

The rest of the images have the same casually seductive feel.

In one picture, Petra leans against a French window, in the mulberry pink Jessie set of lace laid on to gold fabric.

The bra cup also includes a secret sling that promises to banish the 'double boob' effect.

In the Ana, she perches on the edge of the bed wearing the black mesh bra which features extra straps over both cups and a diamante feature at the centre of the Brazilian pants.

Petra's Ultimo predecessor is Abbey Clancy, the Strictly Come Dancing champion and model, currently five months pregnant with her second child.

She revealed her feelings about her changing body in to The Times yesterday. 

She said: ‘One part of your brain is going, 'Oh my God, I'm so blessed, it's a miracle', and the other half is going, 'I can't bear this, I'm so fat, I'm ugly, I've got headaches, I've got spots, I feel sick.’

When Petra was announced as the new face - and body - of the brand, the company's founder Michelle Mone said: 'I'm thrilled to announce that Petra is the new face and body of Ultimo.

'She is a supermodel who has international success, and – once you see the new campaign images – it's easy to understand why. 

'We're delighted to have her representing Ultimo.' 

As well as being beautiful and multi-lingual, Petra is also known for her charity work.

After survived the 2004 tsunami in which her fiance tragically died, she founded the Happy Hearts Fund in 2005 which builds schools in disaster-hit areas.
