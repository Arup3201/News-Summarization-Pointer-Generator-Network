Louis Vuitton is the go-to brand for designer handbags in almost every fashion-savvy city in America, according to new market research.

Unless you happen to live in Miami or New York, that is, where Chanel is the most popular choice. In whichever city you look at, however, French-owned labels absolutely dominate the handbag market.

In a survey conducted by San Francisco-based designer consignment retailer The RealReal, which analysed sales data from its top ten biggest-spending cities, five brands stood head-and-shoulders above the rest in terms of popularity: Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Gucci, Céline, Hermés and Goyard.

The results, published by StyleList, reveal that Louis Vuitton out-performed its competition in nearly every one of the cities which sold the most designer handbags overall; Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington D.C. and Seattle.

Hardly surprising, since the LVMH-owned French label was listed by Forbes as the most valuable luxury brand in the world this year; worth an eye-watering $29.9billion.

Also popular: Gucci came second in Seattle, and the third in Denver and Dallas, and Céline came third in Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Pictured (left) a $2,450 Gucci bag and (right) a $2,120 Céline option

Runners-up: Hermés came third in Washington D.C. and Miami, and second in New York, while Goyard came in second for Denver shoppers. Pictured (left) a $4,775 Hermés bag and (right) a $1,395 Goyard purse

A Louis Vuitton handbag will cost you anywhere from $1,900 for a classic monogram hobo to upwards of $5,000 for some of its latest offerings.

1.  Chicago, Illinois: Louis Vuitton, Chanel            Céline

2.  Dallas, Texas: Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Gucci

3.  Denver, Colorado: Louis Vuitton, Goyard,      Gucci

4.  Houston, Texas: Louis Vuitton, Chanel,          Hermés

5.  Los Angeles, California: Louis Vuitton,            Chanel, Céline

6.  Miami, Florida: Chanel, Louis Vuitton,              Hermés

7.  New York, New York: Chanel, Hermés,          Louis Vuitton

8.  San Francisco, California: Louis Vuitton,        Chanel, Céline

9.  Washington D.C.: Louis Vuitton, Chanel,          Hermés

10. Seattle, Washington: Louis Vuitton,                Gucci, Chanel 

Chanel wasn't far behind on the list, coming in as the second most popular choice in Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington D.C.; and first in New York and Miami.

A new quilted handbag from the current collection will set you back $5,600, but if you're after a special edition piece, you're looking at tens of thousands of dollars.

Gucci, an Italian brand and the only non-French label on the popularity list, was the second choice for shoppers in Seattle, and the third in Denver and Dallas.

Céline came third in three states, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco; and iconic brand Hermés came third in Washington D.C. and Miami, and second in New York.

Hermés, purveyor of the iconic Birkin bag, famously sold a Himalayan crocodile variety in September for a whopping $185,000 at auction in Los Angeles - the highest price ever commanded by the Parisian brand.

And you can't get your hands on a standard pre-owned Birkin for much less than $10,000.

The only other designer handbag brand to be a top-three seller across the ten states was Goyard, which came in second for Denver shoppers.

This lesser-known label was founded in Paris in 1853  and is known to be the oldest Parisian trunk maker still in business. You can't buy a new Goyard bag anywhere online as the brand states it 'does not engage in any e-commerce.'

It is only available in select boutiques around Europe, Asia and the U.S., but a pre-owned bag costs between $1,395 and $1,595 on The RealReal.
