One of the oldest women in Pennsylvania received a long-overdue benefit bump after the survivor payments she from her deceased husband’s WWI service went from $36 per month to $1,000.

Because of her diligent son who spent years trying to get Alda Collin’s veteran’s benefits increased, the 110-year-old woman got a significant boost to her bank account.

Mrs Collins’ husband William served in the Cavalry of the U.S. Army during World War I and was stationed in Mexico and Texas ‘because they had some skirmishes down there,’ his son Jim told MailOnline.

Happy couple: William Collins married Alda before he served in the Army during WWI and when he died at the age of 81 in 1976, she began receiving his veteran's benefits which were $36-per-month

Back in time: Alda's husband William served as in the U.S. Army's Cavalry during WWI and his son says that he was stationed in Mexico and Texas because 'there were some skirmishes down there' at the time

When Mr Collins died when he was
81-years-old in 1976, that is when his widow Alda began receiving his 
veterans benefits. At the time, those benefits were set at $36 per 
month.

Those benefits 
provided some help to Ms Collins initially, as the cost of living was 
much lower and the former teacher was living by herself in a trailer for
many years.

When she 
turned 106-years-old, her son moved her into St. Benedict’s Manor 
nursing home and he says that though she just turned 110 last week 
earning her the title of one of the top three oldest women in 
Pennsylvania, she is still in good health.

‘She
still feeds herself and uses a walker to get around. She subscribes to 
The National Enquirer and reads that all the time,’ Jim, 73, said.

Family support: Alda and William had two children, William II (far right) who has since died and Jim (far left) who is now 73-years-old and has pushed for his mother's benefits to be increased

Though she is comfortable, that has little to do with the minimal veterans benefits which have clearly not kept up with inflation.

In 2008, Jim first sent a letter to the office of veteran’s affairs in hopes of increasing their monthly pay out, but he heard little back and ‘just got form letters every month for years’.

After seeing a television ad for Congressman Mark Critz which touted the work he did for senior citizens, the dutiful son called his office and inquired about getting some help to move the issue up the ladder.

Six weeks later, the monthly check was raised without notice from $36 to $1,000. Now Mrs Collins will receive an additional $25,000 in back benefits starting from the date of Jim’s first 2008 inquiry.

‘If I’d have known I would have applied much sooner,’ he told MailOnline.

Today: Jim joins his mother Alda in St. Benedict Manor nursing home, and she turned 110 last week

Together for decades: Alda was a schoolteacher in a one-room school and William returned home from WWI and became a barber

Though the sudden check increase stunned Jim, it still hasn’t quite sunk in for his mother, who used to be a teacher in a one-room schoolhouse that was heated only by a potbelly stove.

 ‘At her age, she didn’t quite believe it and she doesn’t realize how much her nursing home and care costs,’ he said.

Democratic Congressman Critz, who represents Pennsylvania’s 12th district, told the local paper that his office was happy to help.

‘It is really just an awesome outcome,’ he told The Tribune Democrat. He posted the story on his Facebook page and urged other seniors to seek assistance if they were not receiving the benefits that they deserved.

‘You can’t help but feel like Mr Collins found a way to say “Happy Birthday” to his wife and just had my office deliver the card.’

Though Mrs Collins herself is a self-described Republican, who fondly remembers the time she was able to serve coffee to then-Vice President Richard Nixon, Mr Critz has found a fan in her son who will have to contribute less every month to his mother’s expenses because of the benefit increase.

‘I’m Independent so I couldn’t vote for him in the primaries but I will certainly be voting for him now!’ Jim said of Congressman Critz.
