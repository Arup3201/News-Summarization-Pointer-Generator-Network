The Home Office came under fire yesterday when it emerged an illegal immigrant brutally raped a young woman - three years after a judge ordered him to be deported.

Abdikarim Abbas Abdisamad, 33, originally from Somalia, befriended a 24-year-old woman in a nightclub claiming he had just lost his job and was penniless.

The victim took pity on Abdisamad and invited him to her home where he raped her twice and battered her so severely she suffered 17 separate injuries.

He was jailed for ten years after being convicted of rape at Coventry Crown Court on Monday.

But during the hearing, it emerged Abdisamad was already a convicted criminal and a judge had ordered his deportation in 2009 when he was jailed for six months for grievous bodily harm.

But he was allowed to remain in Britain because of his immigration status and civil war in his home country of Somalia.

Now bungling Home Office officials are working to finally deport him.

Alp Mehmet, vice-chairman of Migration Watch, said: 'Anyone who doesn’t have the right to be here who has been told to get out should leave and leave quickly.

'In essence I would say that those who have no right to be here and who have been sentenced for horrific crimes should go quickly.

'Unfortunately we do have to abide by certain agreements. We should do rather more to change the attitudes and rules and regulations that prevent some people being deported.

'I think there are far too many obstacles put in our way that need to be removed.'

Abdisamad, who gave the court an address in London, was in the country on a working visa.

The Home Office say that to deport a criminal, certain criteria needed to be met and in Abdisamad’s case that had not happened.

But they refused to reveal what part of his immigration status prevented his removal.

A spokesman said: 'We always seek to remove foreign offenders convicted of a serious crime once they have been punished.

'That is why we removed more than 4,500 of them last year.

'Removal can be a challenging process and we have to operate within the law.'

Abdisamad’s rape victim suffered a broken cheekbone and several deep cuts - requiring stitches after the attack.

He was arrested in October after police used items left in his victim’s home in Coventry to trace him to a location in London.

Det Con Sunita Sharma, from Coventry Public Protection Unit, said: 'To see this man be given such a long custodial sentence is extremely satisfying for both his victim and those of us who have investigated the case and supported her throughout.

'The young lady thought he was a genuine guy, down on his luck and unaware of what fate lay in store.

'She has been left afraid to stay in her own home and unable to trust her own judgement or any man again.

'I hope this sentence offers some relief to the victim, and we admire her courage in speaking up to bring her attacker to justice.'

Abdisamad, who admitted one count of rape but was found not guilty of another, was also put on the sex offender’s register for life.

A count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm was ordered to lie on file.
