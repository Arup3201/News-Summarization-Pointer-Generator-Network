Make up giant Sephora's much-awaited first Australian store opening was overshadowed by a glaring typo on their Facebook page.

If they were hoping to attract attention to the store's opening in Sydney on Friday, they certainly did so, but perhaps not in the way they were intending. 

On the store's 'Countdown to Beauty' hashtag, they missed the essential letter 'o' in count, leaving a particularly bad swear word on the page instead.

The slip-up has caused plenty of laughter and no shortage of commentary on social media, with some even suggesting the slip-up was actually a case of 'any publicity is good publicity'.

Getting your message across? Sephora's much touted countdown to its first Southern Hemisphere super store opening in Sydney has been overshadowed by a missing 'o'

Most people remain unsure if the slip was a deliberate one, with Twitter user Trevor Gosbell writing: 'Come on, #c***downtobeauty has to be deliberate, doesn't it? This will end well'.

Somewhat more critical, Keith Walsh tweeted: '#C***downtobeauty makes for an awkward opening for Sephora tomorrow #fail or #genius #notsure'.

Many fans of the store simply took the typo into their stride, with some actually thanking the post for brightening up their day.

'Ehehe. This actually makes Sephora's opening even better,' Twitter user, Monkey, wrote.

'I cont WAIT for Sephora to open in Sydney! Best fock up ever!!!' Miss Abigail tweeted.

The slip was also reported by a wide range of media including Pedestrian TV, which described it as 'unfortunate' and blamed the fail on a 'presumably very recently employed social media manager', adding: 'Welcome to 'Straya, Sephora. We love a good Countdown here.'

It wasn't missed on Mumbrella either: 'Whilst cosmetics store Sephora was looking to make a bit of a splash on social media for the opening of its new store in Sydney tomorrow, it probably wasn't banking on a botched hashtag to get the job done.

'Earlier this week the brand launched the #countdowntobeauty hashtag on its Facebook page. Unfortunately someone forgot to spell check it, and missed out the all important 'o' in count. Yep.'

The Sydney store is just hours away from opening - its parent shop in Paris boasts six million visitors each year, more than the Eiffel Tower

But back to the cosmetics; boyfriends and husbands should brace themselves for the opening of a cosmetics vortex, where hours can be lost in a blur of lipsticks, lotions and potion.

The store opens at midday on Friday.

It will be the largest Sephora store in the Southern Hemisphere, with more expected to follow around Australia. Founded in France more than three decades ago, Sephora is akin to a lolly shop for beauty and cosmetics addicts.

The company boasts its Champs-Elysees store in Paris receives six million visitors each year - that's more than the Eiffel Tower.

As well as Sephora's own range, the Sydney store will stock brands like Marc Jacobs Beauty, Make Up For Ever and Kat Von D.

Von D is in Sydney for the launch and will appear in store on Saturday to meet the first 300 shoppers who buy one of her products.

'This has been years of Australian girls like bitching at me about not being able to get this stuff shipped over here,' she said.

'I think people are going to love it. I think the only people who are going to hate it are probably the boyfriends waiting around while the girls spend three hours in there.'

When she launched her cosmetics brand seven years ago, it was just four shades of red lipsticks.

Now her Studded Kiss lipsticks are the number one sellers in Sephora US.

Von D says the best beauty tip she can give people is to be sure of themselves.

'Confidence, to me, is the sexiest attribute you can have,' she said.

When she is wearing make-up, Von D pairs her signature red lips (the metallic orange-based red Adora from her collection is her favourite) with a clean, cat eye.

Despite the fact the store hasn't opened yet, Sephora Australia has more than 15,000 Instagram followers.

Sephora already has about 1900 stores in 29 countries.
