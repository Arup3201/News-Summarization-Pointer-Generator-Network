Newcastle United manager Alan Pardew is adamant that teams competing in the Europa League should play subsequent Premier League games on a Monday night, but his calls have fallen on deaf ears.

The Magpies qualified for Europe two years ago but struggled to juggle the domestic rigours as well - and Pardew reckons Tottenham and Everton are at a similar disadvantage this season.

He argues the disparity in results could be eradicated by allowing for an extra rest day, but Sportsmail has learned that isn’t feasible and goes against Premier League regulations.

Ross Barkley and Christian Eriksen do battle as Tottenham against Everton at White Hart Lane on Sunday 

Mauricio Pochettino’s Spurs and the Toffees, who faced each other at White Hart Lane on Sunday have found life difficult in the Premier League this season – the latter only in the top half by virtue of a better goal difference than Liverpool.

‘I don’t think it is fair on any Europa League team to play on Thursday night and Sunday, I really don’t,’ Pardew said.

‘With the travel and everything, that really needs to be looked at by the Premier League. I don’t see why they can’t play on a Monday, the TV would like it.' 

Having any additional games on a Monday night would mean further diluting the weekend’s action, as well as providing supporters with extra travel headaches after matches, while broadcasters would not directly benefit from any move.
