Bob Suter, one of the heroes of the USA's 'Miracle on Ice' hockey team

Bob Suter, one of the heroes of the USA's 'Miracle on Ice' hockey team that won gold in the 1980 Winter Olympics, has died of a massive heart attack aged 57.

The feisty defenseman, who played a key part in Herb Brooks' famous side, was at the ice rink he owned in Middleton, Wisconsin, when he collapsed on Tuesday.

Suter suffered a broken ankle two months before the games at Lake Placid, New York, but recovered in time to take part in all seven matches at the tournament.

Suter will go down in history as a member of the team that defied all the odds to beat strong favorites the Soviet Union - before going on to win gold.

His son Ryan, himself an NHL standout, said in a statement: 'The sudden loss of my father has been difficult for myself and our family — my dad was my hero and he taught me about life, hockey and what was truly important — family.

'He will be missed greatly and his legacy and spirit will be with us every day. He lived with the motto, "It’s all about the kids," and forever he will be remembered by this.

'My family and I also want to say thank you for the tremendous outpouring of support we have received from the hockey community around the world. It means a lot to us to know how much he was loved and will be missed.' 

Gary Suter, 50, a former NHL All-Star who played in two Olympics of his own, once described his older brother's playing style as 'abrasive', the New York Daily News reports.

He said: 'He always had people chasing him around the ice. He was the sort of guy you hated playing against and loved having him your team.'

Suter is the first player from the fabled U.S. Olympic ice hockey team to pass away - with coach Herb Brooks dying in a car accident 11 years ago.

After a brief career in minor-league hockey, Bob Suter opened a sporting goods store and the rink, Capitol Ice Arena, spending years working as a youth coach.

Mark Johnson, the gifted center and top scorer on the 1980 team, was not only Suter's teammate, but also his close friend.

The 'Miracle on Ice' is the name given to a men's ice hockey game during the 1980 Winter Olympics at Lake Placid, New York. 

The United States national team, made up of amateur and collegiate players and led by coach Herb Brooks, defeated the Soviet Union, which had won the gold medal in six of the seven previous Olympic games.

After trailing for much of the match, they scored with ten minutes left to go 4-3 ahead and then held on to seal the historic win in a nail-biting finish.

Team USA went on to win the gold medal after winning their last match over Finland. 

The Soviet Union took the silver medal by beating Sweden in its final game. 

In 1999, Sports Illustrated named the 'Miracle on Ice' the Top Sports Moment of the 20th Century. 

As part of its 100th anniversary celebrations in 2008, the International Ice Hockey Federation chose the 'Miracle on Ice' as the century's number-one international ice hockey story.

He said: 'He had a huge impact on hockey everywhere.' 

USA Hockey issued a statement in the wake of Suter's death on Tuesday, calling it a 'tough day for our sport.'

'Bob Suter will always be remembered for his role as a member of the 1980 Miracle on Ice Team that captivated our country and whose impact is impossible to measure. 

'His legacy, however, is far beyond that as he dedicated his life to advancing hockey and helping young people achieve their dreams. 

'Bob's positive impact on our sport will be felt for generations to come. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Suter family at this difficult time.'

Minnesota Wild, who Suter's son, plays for, said he was 'a great hockey ambassador, he was a terrific person off the ice who will be greatly missed.' 

Bob Suter's funeral will be held at Alliant Energy Center on Saturday at 11am and it is believed that fellow 'Miracle on Ice teammate, Mark Johnson, will read a eulogy. 

The whole of the Wild team will fly out to the funeral, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported.
