A dreamlike treehouse in Cornwall that was originally built for children has been transformed into a popular miniature hotel fetching £100 per night.

Builder and artist Jonathan Melville-Smith created the treehouse in a sturdy ash tree a few years back, first as a basic platform before it became a comfy cabin, but says his children were unimpressed.

Visitors from all around the world on the other hand are besotted by the quirky rental's charms, which include stunning water views of Falmouth Bay and the rustling of leaves at night.

'At first it started out for the kids, but they weren't too interested,' Melville-Smith said. 'After building the platform, I didn't do too much more to it for a couple of years.

'We have some gypsy wagons on site that our friends stayed in and we'd started renting them out.

'Once I had enough money, I put a shed in the tree and made it a bit more homely. It's proved really popular - maybe because it's so quirky and different.'

Along with Tree Sparrow treehouse, Melville-Smith also rents out two gypsy cabins named Rosie and Elle for £75 per night (less for longer-term stays) through Outlandish Holidays.

He also hosts stays in a beautifully appointed tipi (£65 per night) and last year's Shed of the Year finalist Jack Sparrow House, a room with a mezzanine double bed and a sit-in kitchen area (£100 per night).

Melville-Smith says once he made the treehouse homely it's proven immensely popular, 'maybe because it's so quirky and different'

A cursory glance may not even spot the Tree Sparrow Treehouse, the name under which it's listed on outlandishholidays.co.uk, but its size is deceiving.

And far from a cold box in a tree it is fully insulated with double-glazed windows, has heating for when the nights get a bit chilly and is accessible via a wooden staircase.

Built to blend in with its environment, with green roof and dark wooden walls, the treehouse on Melville-Smith's farm in Helston, Cornwall, also enjoys spectacular sunsets over the orchards of Tregaminion.

The building itself, 'a shed' on a platform as its creator describes it, is kitted out with a bunk bed, mini stove and fairy lights all 10ft off the ground. 

A gas stove plus pots and pans are included in the nightly price for the treehouse, which also has a bed that could be used by kids

Melville-Smith works in the sunshine on the treehouse, the first one of which he made when he was just 10 years old

Its views take in the beautiful Lizard Peninsula and costs £100 per night for a couple, and £10 extra per child.

Jonathan, who spent his childhood on a farm in Worcestershire, said he built his first treehouse by aged 10.

'From a young age, I grew up around building work so I was constantly getting involved - probably too much,' he said. 

'I'd always dreamed of building a house where everything - inside and out - was built with my own hands. In the end, it turned out to be this treehouse.'
