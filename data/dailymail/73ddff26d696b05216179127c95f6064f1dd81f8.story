An airman who recently returned from the Middle East proposed to his cheerleader girlfriend during Sunday night's NFL game between the Arizona Cardinals and the Washington Redskins. 

Cardinals squad member Claire Thorton was performing for fans at the home ground ahead of the fixture.

But the excitement of match day was stepped up a notch when her partner, Air Force Captain Erick Straub, marched onto the pitch, in full military attire, and got down on one knee and proposed.

There was good news on the field as well as the Arizona Cardinals stormed to a 30-20 victory 

Thankfully, Thorton said yes while her Cardinals side went on to win 30-20 in front of a packed crowd at the University of Phoenix Stadium. 

The Redskins sought to end a three-game losing streak by stealing an away victory but were dispatched by Bruce Arians' side. 

Cardinals quarterback Carson Palmer, who returned from a five-week lay-off, stole the show.

He threw two touchdown passes to send his side top of the NFC West,
