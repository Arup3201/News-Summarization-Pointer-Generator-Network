The father of a New York City teen who drowned on a class trip in June received a phone call from the school last week to discuss his son’s poor attendance.

Though Jean Fritz Pierre, 16, died over the summer while swimming in a Bear Mountain State Park, his Prospect Park, Brooklyn high school evidentally didn’t update their records and put in the insensitive call to his still grieving father.

Now Jonas Pierre says he’s stricken by the death all over again as he comes to grips with how this horrific mistake could have happened.

Grave mistake: Jean Fritz Pierre drowned in June while on a class trip to Bear Mountain State Park in New York's Hudson Valley, but his father got a call from his high school about his son's absences just last week

Sad: The 16-year-old's father Jonas Pierre recalled saying, 'Don't you know my son is dead?' Pierre, 39, is suing the city of New York, who he blames for his son's untimely death

‘I think, why are you calling, why are you telling me this,’ Pierre, 39, recalled to the New York Daily News. ‘Don’t you know my son is dead?’

Jean Fritz Pierre died in June while on a field trip with Prospect Heights International High School.

The 16-year-old was trying to cool off after a hike in sweltering heat and drowned while swimming in Hessian Lake in the Hudson Valley.

Schools Chancellor Dennis Walcott says the students had been on a hike when Pierre and another student decided to go into the water, even though they weren't supposed to go in. That's when Pierre drowned.

The supervisors of the class trip were
 cleared of wrongdoing in Pierre’s death, which was deemed an accidental
 drowning, but this most recent development makes the school look 
negligent in a different way.

‘Maybe
 the school doesn’t think it’s important, but it’s important to me,’ he 
told the Daily News. ‘I don’t think I could ever get another son like 
him.’

The Education Department said they would remedy the situation.

‘We
 apologize for any pain or suffering this may have caused the family and
 are checking all data systems to ensure that the family doesn’t receive
 these calls anymore,’ agency spokeswoman Erin Hughes told the Daily 
News.

Pierre plans to sue the school system, which he still blames for his son’s death.

His attorney Mark Rayo said that Pierre has yet to get an apology from the city.

‘They added insult to injury,’ said Rayo. ‘How neglectful can you get?’

Despite warnings, Pierre drowned in Hessian Lake in June. Now, as his father has stiill only just begun to grieve, his pain has been amplified by the phone call, for which his lawyer Mark Rayo says Pierre has yet to get an apology
