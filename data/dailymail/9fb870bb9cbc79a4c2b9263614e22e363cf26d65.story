Roger Federer rolled back time last season, but looked like he was feeling all of his 33 years as he was dramatically ousted from the Australian Open.

Facing Andreas Seppi, the world No 46 who he had beaten 10 out of 10 times previously, Federer slumped to a 6-4 7-6 4-6 7-6 defeat in a shade under three hours on the Rod Laver Arena.

The final point, a stunning forehand down the line on the run, was handed down from the Gods to the largely uncelebrated Italian, a nearly man who has only briefly infiltrated the top 20 in his career.

He took advantage of an unusually sluggish and tetchy Federer, who had been scheduled to meet Andy Murray in the quarter-final stage in what has looked the toughest part of the draw.

You were left wondering if the great Swiss was paying the price for what was a fairly truncated off season. 

He did not finish off playing the Davis Cup final until late November and then paid a brief visit to the International Premier Tennis League in India.

He stated that the foundation for his excellent 2014 was the preparation work he did in the off season before last. 

He did win the Brisbane Open at the start of this month, but there was a lack of vigour when presented with his first serious test over five sets.

In a tight first set, Seppi was first to break for 5-4 as Federer struggled for consistency, netting with the forehand before Seppi served it out. 

Federer had also dropped the first set to Seppi's compatriot Simone Bolelli before coming back for a four-set win, however this time the Swiss continued to make errors and Seppi took the second set in a tiebreak when Federer missed a forehand volley.

Federer threatened to fight back by breaking for 2-1 in the third set and that was enough for him to go on to claim the third set as he comfortably served it out.

But Federer repeatedly showed his frustrations with his game in the fourth set which went to a tiebreak and Seppi hit a stunning inside-out forehand to set up match point at 6-5.

Seppi then sealed victory in stunning fashion as he hit a forehand slice on the backfoot which flew past Federer down the line for a famous victory.
