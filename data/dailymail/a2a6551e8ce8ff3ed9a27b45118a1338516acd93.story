A 15-year-old boy told a court that he’s not making up affair with his French teacher because he knows she had breast implants and other intimate details about the 42-year-old mother.

The boy testified to the Toronto court that he was not making his story up and that his former French teacher Mary Gowans told him about her decision to get breast implants.

‘Where did the teen hear that? She never told anyone she had breast implants,' attorney Soula Olver said.

Shocked: Gowans, pictured outside court, said that a few days later police turned up to arrest her

Testifying in her own defense at a Toronto court, Gowans, 42, denied they had ever had a romance and claimed the teenager, now 18, had kissed and grabbed her crotch in January 2010.

He has accused his former French teacher of a number of intimate encounters, including exposing her breasts to him, after favouring him as one of her students at Joseph Howe Sr. Public School.

But defense lawyers have claimed it was he who took a liking to his teacher, who has since lost her job and separated from her husband of 17 years, and eventually became 'obsessed' with her.

The Toronto Sun reports Gowan's lawyer painted a different picture of the boy, who she described as 'assertive, confident and to an extent, arrogant'.

Speaking to the court, Gowans recounted how her son and daughter were playing hide-and-seek at the home when she leaned in to the teen to reveal where her son was hiding.

But he kissed her on the lips and grabbed her crotch, to her surprise, she said.

Student's pet: Mary Gowans, 42, has denied having a string of sexual encounters with a 15-year-old student and said she was stunned when he made a move at her while he was babysitting her children

In court: She added that she took him home immediately and said he could not return to the house again

'It took a second to realize what was 
going on. Then, I pushed him back and said, "What are you doing? Stop!"'
she said, according to the Toronto Sun.

'He looked a little shocked and I was 
extremely shocked. This was right out of the blue for me. I had 
absolutely no idea this was coming. I felt he had taken advantage of my 
kindness.'

She said she gathered herself and then
told her children they were driving the boy home. The next day, after 
coaching the boy in hockey practice, she told him he would never return 
to her home.

'It never occurred to me to report him to the police. I thought the consequences like that didn’t seem fitting,' she said.

'My children loved him and it was hurtful when I heard (his testimony that) he didn’t care for them,' said Gowans.

Accusations: The teenager, now 18, told the court they had at least four sexual encounters after his teacher took a liking to him. He admitted he had had sexual fantasies about her

In the dock: Gowans said he had become a member of the family and they regularly exchanged texts

'I considered him like a member of our family.'

They sent text messages to each other 
in the week afterwards and he repeatedly apologised and said he was 
worried she would tell his parents, she said.

A communications company testified on 
Thursday that Gowans and the boy exchanged 2,218 text messages over a 
year beginning in February 2009.

A few days later, police knocked on her door and she was arrested with her children looking on.

'I couldn’t believe what was happening,' she told the court, the Toronto Star reported.

Scene: She taught the boy French at Joseph Howe Sr. Public School in Toronto. She has since lost her job

The teen, who was 15 at the time of 
the relationship and is now an 18-year-old at college, testified earlier
in the case that they engaged in four to six sex-play sessions 
involving kissing and touching between November 2009 and January 2010.

He said she allowed him to place a 
hand on her private parts on two separate occasions but she stopped him,
saying it felt wrong.

Yet Gowans contested it had not happened, and said she was as friendly with the boy as she was with her other students.

The teen, who admitted he had had 
sexual fantasies about his teacher, had also claimed she showed him her 
breasts through a wet T-shirt, but she claimed he started the incident 
by suddenly spraying her with water.

The court case continues.
