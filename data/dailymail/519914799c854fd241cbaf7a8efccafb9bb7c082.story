A 72-year-old woman is set to go on trial for shooting dead her second husband, nearly 30 years after she was acquitted of murdering her first husband in eerily similar circumstances.

Colleen Ann Harris, whose case is expected to open on Wednesday, is accused of shooting dead her estranged husband, Robert 'Bob' Harris, in their Placerville, California home in January 2013.

Decades before, in 1985, she shot dead her first husband and the father of her three children, 46-year-old James Batten, after claiming he had been abusive towards her.

Both killings were carried out in the same home with the same type of gun, and in both cases, after pulling the trigger, she claimed she had temporary amnesia and could not remember doing it.

'In each case, she kills her husband in the bedroom. In each case, she uses a shotgun,' said El Dorado County Deputy District Attorney Joe Alexander, wrote in court papers, the Sacramento Bee reported.

'In each case, she is going through marital difficulties. In each case, she delays reporting the crime... In each case she claims a loss of memory as a defense.' 

She was acquitted in her 1986 trial after claiming she had acted in self defense when her husband, whom she was divorcing, held a pistol to her head, threatened to kill her and sexually abused her.

She said she couldn't remember killing him and a psychiatrist testified during the trial that she suffered from limited amnesia.

The prosecution told a very different tale.

They claimed she had shot her husband as he read a newspaper in bed and then killed him with another shot at close range, before putting a pistol in the bed to make it look like self-defense.

She waited an hour before calling the Sheriff's Office.

The jury ultimately said there was insufficient evidence that she intended to murder her husband and she was acquitted of murder.

Then in 1990, she married Bob Harris, who had two sons and a daughter. They divorced in 2004 but then married again a year later.

Then in 2012, as Harris took a trip to Mongolia, where he taught environmental conservation to students, he met another woman and began a relationship with her, the Bee reported.

When he returned to California, he and his wife separated and he moved out.

But when Colleen Harris was house-bound following hip-replacement surgery, he returned to the Placerville home to help her.

'My dad, bless his heart, was there taking care of Colleen despite whatever circumstances were going on between them,' his son Andy Harris told the Sacramento Bee.

Then on January 5, 2013, she overheard her husband making a call to his love interest overseas and later that night or the following morning, she shot him as he slept, prosecutors claim.

She then allegedly drove to San Francisco and stashed her husband's cellphone, a handgun - not the same one used in the murder - and his coin collection, in her son's garage.

After returning home, she called the lawyer who won her previous case and told him that she had shot her husband, prosecutors say. The lawyer then contacted the Sheriff's Office.

Beloved: He worked in the Forest Service and as an instructor with the El Dorado Sheriff's Department

El Dorado County Deputy District Attorney Joe Alexander said that Harris claimed she had been in a 'gray fog' but insisted she would never shoot her husband.

Mr Harris' family said they remain devastated by the loss.

'The death of your father is devastating enough,' Andy Harris said. 'And then there is the person who is brought into your family and loved as a family member.

'There is a real sense of betrayal and wondering if this person had the capacity to love.'

His father had worked with the Forest Service for 30 years before retiring in 1997, according to his obituary. He umpired baseball, from Little League to semi-professional teams, and worked as an instructor with the El Dorado Sheriff's Department.

A judge has ruled that prosecutors may talk about the first case in the upcoming trial.

Attorney Eric Schlueter had fought the decision, saying in court papers: 'The prior incident has ZERO relevance to the current action especially in light of the fact that Mrs. Harris was ACQUITTED of the charge.'
