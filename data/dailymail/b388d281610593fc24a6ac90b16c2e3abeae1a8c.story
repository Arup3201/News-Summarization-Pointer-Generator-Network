Lionel Messi is perhaps the most famous graduate of Barcelona's famed La Masia football factory.

One of the best players in the world alongside Real Madrid's talisman Cristiano Ronaldo, Messi has dazzled and delighted since a young age having joined the Spanish academy in 2000. Blistering pace, exquisite control and unstoppable skill, Messi has it all.

However, judging by the current crop of young talent on show amongst the Barcelona youth ranks, the La Liga giants have a host of young stars waiting in the wings, ready to replicate Messi on the Nou Camp pitch.

Some of the sumptuous strikes and mesmerising moves produced by the youngsters currently on Barcelona's books are strikingly similar to those of the first-team. 

From Xavi to Cesc Fabregas, Andres Iniesta to Pep Guardiola a host of world-class talent has been nurtured at Barcelona and the production line shows no signs of slowing. 

Judge for yourself... here are the top ten goals from the Catalan giants' famous La Masia football factory.

10. JEAN MARIE DONGOU 

Cameroonian forward Jean Marie Dongou arrived at La Masia through the Samuel Eto'o foundation and, at the age of 19, has already made one appearance for the Barcelona first-team.

The striker's tidy finish, hit across his body at the near post for Barcelona B against Alcoron, begins the top ten countdown.

9. NICOLAS FUENTES 

Pint-sized Nicolas Fuentes may share Messi's haistyle and slight frame but also glides across the pitch like the Barcelona No 10.

Playing for the Catalan side's Under 12 D side in November the youngster weaved his way past a Cornella defender before sending a powerful left-footed effort past the goalkeeper and into the corner of the net.

8. AITOR CANTALAPIEDRA 

Aitor Cantalapiedra must be a defender's nightmare with his weaving runs causing mayhem.

In at No 8, the Barcelona Under 18s star cuts in from the right, races towards goal and  leaves his first victim on the floor and jinks past two more opponents before coolly curling the ball into the back of the net.

7. PAU SERVAT

Some of you may remember little Pau Servat. The youngster went viral back in 2013 having shed some tears following a missed penalty. Luckily for Servat, he managed to bag the winning goal in the second half!

In this rundown, Servat found the net once more, launching a powerful left-footed rocket high into the corner of the net. Pick that one out!

6. IKER ALMENA

Iker Almenia completed a tidy team move with the cheekiest of backheel's.

The finish would have made Nwankou Kanu proud (Remember that goal for Arsenal against Middlesbrough) as well as fellow Spaniard Ayoze Perez who pulled off the same trick to score for Newcastle against Tottenham this season. 

Iker Almenia produced a cheeky backheel which compatriot Ayoze Perez would have been supremely proud of

5. IKER MERINO

Iker Merino wasn't even born when Macedonia's Artim Sakiri curled the ball up and over England goalkeeper David Seaman from the corner spot back in 2002.

However, that did't stop young Merino producing a carbon copy of the goal almost 12 years later.

4. ABEL RUIZ

Under 14 striker Abel Ruiz was coolness personified against Girona at No 4 in the countdown.

The young Barcelona frontman received the ball in the area with the goalkeeper closing in before delicately chipping the ball into the net.

3. LIONEL ENGUENE 

Another young Cameroon player in the La Masia academy courtesy of the Samuel Eto'o foundation, Lionel Enguene looks an incredible talent.

Facing PSG in the UEFA Youth League, the 19-year-old started a blistering run from the centre circle into the area before sending the goalkeeper the wrong way.

Wearing the No 10 shirt like Messi, it's a goal the Argentina international himself would have bee proud of.

2. ALEN HALILOVIC 

Having amassed seven caps already for the Croatia national team, Alen Halilovic has been impressing for Barcelona's second string following his March arrival from Dinamo Zagreb.

Starring against Girona the 18-year-old receives the ball in his own half and gallops forward.

Showing great feet the midfielder charges into the box before thundering the ball home. 

Seemingly like so many of the other great goals in this list, this particular strike and movement certainly bares a resemblance to the shooting style and forward running of another Barcelona graduate...

1. RIQUI PUIG

Barcelona are famed for their brilliant team moves and the distinctive style of play has clearly been passed down the academy.

Riqui Puig, who only turns 16 in August, start and ends the move which takes the No 1 spot in the list of La Masia goals.

'Pass and move, pass and move' is the only thing going through the minds of these young Barcelona hopefuls as the team move up the field perfectly threading the ball to each other before Puig cooly places the ball to score at Baladona. 

Riqui Puig started and finished a stunning team move to claim No 1 spot in La Masia's top ten goals
