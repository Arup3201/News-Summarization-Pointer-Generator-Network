The majestic moons and rings of Saturn are thought to hold the key to understanding the origins of the universe.

And now Nasa has been able to capture the planet’s dazzling rings in unprecedented detail, along with its 'Death Star' moon seen glowing in the distance.

The space agency’s Cassini probe took this image on October 22, 2013, when it was about 1.6 million miles (2.6 million km) from Saturn.

Among the interplay of Saturn's shadow and rings, Mimas, which appears in the lower-right corner of the image, orbits Saturn as a set of the ever-intriguing spokes appear in the B ring (just to the right of centre)

The planet’s moon Mimas, also known as the ‘Death Star’ because of its resemblance to the space station, is visible as a pin prick of light at the bottom right.

The image also shows the mysterious ‘spokes’ in Saturn's B ring, just to the right of centre.

What creates these spokes is still a mystery, but scientists do know that the spokes no longer appear when the sun is higher in Saturn's sky.

‘It is believed that this has to do with the ability of micron-sized ring grains to maintain an electrical charge and levitate above the rings, forming spokes,’ Nasa said.

Saturn's moon Mimas, also known as the ‘Death Star’ can be seen as a pin prick of light (circled in red) in the right image. The left image highlights the 'mysterious 'spokes' on the planet's rings

Saturn's moon Mimas peeps out from behind the larger moon Dione in this view from the Cassini spacecraft. Mimas (246 miles, or 396 kilometres across) is near the bottom center of the image. Saturn's rings are also visible in the top right

In a talk at American Geophysical Union in December, Professor Carl Murray of Queen Mary University of London said he noticed a strange bend when poring over images on from Nasa's Cassini spacecraft. The mysterious object, which was located at the right edge of Saturn's A ring, has been named 'Peggy' after Professor Murray's mother-in-law

Launched in 1997, Cassini has been exploring Saturn and its series of moons since 2004.

On
 Saturn, a full year is the equivalent to 30 Earth years, meaning 
Cassini has only been able to observe a third of a Saturn year.

Since 2004, Saturn and its moons have seen the seasons change from northern winter to northern summer.

Cassini
 has studied the planet and its many natural satellites since arriving 
there in 2004, also observing Jupiter, the heliosphere, and testing the 
theory of relativity.

Cassini is the fourth space probe to visit Saturn and the first to enter orbit.

Mimas is an inner moon of Saturn and averages 246 miles (396 km) in diameter.  Mimas and another Saturn moon, Rhea, have been called ‘the most heavily cratered body in the solar system.’

Based on data gathered from the Cassini spacecraft, scientists last year estimated that Saturn’s rings date back more than four billion years.

Its images have provided some surprises for scientists in the past few years.

For instance in a talk at American Geophysical Union in December, Professor Carl Murray of Queen Mary University of London said he noticed a strange bend when poring over images on from Nasa’s Cassini spacecraft.

The mysterious object, which was located at the right edge of Saturn’s A ring, has been named ‘Peggy’ after Professor Murray’s mother-in-law.

Peggy is thought to be about a 0.6 miles (1km) in diameter, which experts claim is too small for it to be a moon.

It could, however, be the build-up of ring material that has collapsed gravitationally under its own weight.

Some of Saturn’s moons, particularly those orbiting near the rings, are thought to have formed in this way, creating a ring of dust then collecting more material to grow.

The planet is known to have of 53 natural rings with two orbiting within gaps in the main rings. Some moons, such as Prometheus and Pandora, interact with ring material, shepherding the ring in its orbit.

Scientists have used this image to analyse mysterious propeller shapes which frequently appear within the rings. Based on data gathered from the Cassini spacecraft, scientists last year estimated that Saturn¿s rings date back more than four billion years

This image was released by Nasa in 2012. The image was made possible by Cassini changing its orbit for the first time in two years. Cassini is the fourth space probe to visit Saturn and the first to enter orbit
