Fast cars, speedboats, yachts … these three men lived a life of luxury, and were more than happy to flaunt their apparent good fortune to the world.

Except Richard Pope, Paul Gunter and Simon Odoni didn’t owe their flashy lifestyles to luck. They owed them to an elaborate scam which fleeced 2,300 people out of £85million.

The three conmen have now been jailed for a total of 43 years at a court in America.

'Arrogant': Paul Gunter, seen aboard Richard Pope's boat No Slack, had built up a portfolio of 26 homes using money stolen from thousands of victims

Their ‘boiler room’ investment scam was the biggest the UK  has ever seen, and destroyed hundreds of lives.

Marriages broke up, retired  professionals were forced to go back to work after losing all their savings, and one distraught man killed himself after being cheated out of £200,000.

Meanwhile Pope, 55, Gunter, 64, and Odoni, 56, were busy frittering away their victims’ cash, buying dozens of properties and extravagant luxuries including Ferraris and a £350,000 private plane.

They arrogantly flaunted their wealth – one photograph shows  Pope making an obscene hand gesture as he posed in his convertible.

'Ruthless': Richard Pope, seen making a rude gesture at the wheel of his sports car, used the proceeds of the trio's £85million fraud to fund a lavish lifestyle

Boiler-room fraud: Simon Odoni, 56, who had been hiding in the Dominican Republic to avoid extradition for his crimes, was caught after a flight he was on was forced to divert and land on U.S. soil

The trio were jailed at a court in Tampa, Florida, marking the conclusion of a seven-year transatlantic investigation that stretched from Spain to the UK and eventually the US, where they will serve their sentences.

Detective Inspector Kerrie Gower of City of London police, who led the inquiry, described the scam as fraud ‘committed on a truly massive scale’.

She said: ‘Pope, Gunter and Odoni are amongst the most ruthless and destructive criminals the City of London police have ever dealt with and deserve every day they will spend behind bars.’

The three employed staff in Spanish call centres who rang British homes selling shares in companies that did not exist.

These ‘investments’ were then funnelled into US bank accounts belonging to the conmen.

The majority of their victims  were retired professionals whose losses ranged from a few hundred pounds to £1million. Many were left penniless.

One devastated victim, 44-year-old Mark Goswami from Huddersfield, took his own life, leaving a wife and daughter.

The boiler room scam began  in 2004 when Pope, Gunter, and Odoni stole details of dormant publicly traded US companies.  The term ‘boiler room’ refers to  the cheap offices that are used to do the selling.

In the case of Pope, Gunter, and Odoni, they employed hundreds of staff in call centres in Spain who made 50 cold calls every day selling the bogus shares.

They used glossy brochures to make the
 investments seem credible and set up a fake website to make it look as 
if stocks were moving up and down, encouraging the victims to invest 
more money.

According to the indictment issued by 
the Middle District  of Florida US Attorney’s office,  the salesmen 
employed ‘high  pressure and misleading’ selling techniques, such as 
saying their own families had invested money in the scheme.

It all fell apart in 2011 when Pope, originally from St Albans in Hertfordshire, was arrested in Spain.

He was extradited to the US, where he admitted mail and wire fraud and testified against the other two.

Odoni, also from St Albans, tried to skip bail in Britain by moving to the Dominican Republic where he spent his days in a waterfront cabana he bought from the proceeds of the scam.

He was caught when a plane he was travelling on had engine trouble and diverted to Miami, where he was arrested.

Odoni and Gunter, who is originally from London, went on trial in March and were found guilty of mail fraud, money laundering and wire fraud charges.

But their refusal to plead guilty meant that three of their British victims, including  Mr Goswami’s widow, had to fly from the UK to Florida to face them in court.

Detective Inspector Gower added: ‘These were arrogant  criminals who were just ripping off UK investors, taking as much as they could from them and  having criminal lifestyles, lavish lifestyles, whereby they were purchasing boats, a plane and high value vehicles.

‘We have 26 properties down in relation to Paul Gunter alone.’

Police said he and Odoni have so far shown no remorse.

Gunter was sentenced to 25 years and Odoni to 13 years and four months. Pope was sentenced to four years and nine months.

Four others were also charged in connection with the scam.

Life of luxury: The group even purchased a plane similar to the one pictured

One of the victims of an £85 million fraud where investors were tricked into buying worthless shares was driven to suicide after losing thousands of pounds.

Mark Goswami killed himself in October 2007, just three days after he had gone to police to raise concerns that he had been conned.

His widow Andrea, 48, who described the former retail manager as 'a very proud, kind and intelligent man', said he was 'devastated' when he discovered what had happened.

'They made me feel sick': Mark Goswani's widow Andrea flew to the U.S. to face the fraudsters in court

She was one of three of Richard Pope, Paul Gunter and Simon Odoni's British victims who flew to Florida to face them in court.

'It was very difficult to go,' the mother-of-one said.

'It was one of the hardest things I had to do, to go into that courtroom.

'I couldn't actually look at them. I couldn't actually bring myself to look at them.

'When I was giving evidence I knew that if I did I would crack and I wouldn't be able to carry on. It was only as I was walking out of the courtroom I looked sideways and that was it.

'They made me feel physically sick.'

Her husband began working from home in 2005, having given up his job as a retail manager, and made an income trading on the fluctuations of foreign exchange markets and investing in shares.In 2007 he began getting cold calls from the fraudsters, and eventually in September that year he confessed to his wife that he may have lost thousands.

He lost more than £70,000 to Pope, Gunter and their accomplices.

Mrs Goswami said: 'He wasn't eating, wasn't sleeping, he was all over the place. He was constantly on the computer, he didn't take a break.

'He was very upset, he was very devastated.'

She discovered that the address given by the investment company IMG was in fact a model agency, and could find no official records for the firm.

After her husband died, she was determined to continue the fight for justice.

Mrs Goswami said: 'I just tried to get every bit of paper that I could find to do with his investments.

'I looked at the computer, trawled through the computer to see what he had been doing, who he'd spoken to; looked at contacts, his diary.

'It's been a very traumatic time. I wanted to understand what boiler room fraud was, because I didn't know such a thing existed.

'I needed to get this done for my husband's sake, to finish something that he'd started."

She said no jail term will be long enough for the devastation they have caused to her and her 14-year-old daughter Grace.

'I'm very, very angry, and no sentence in my eyes will be long enough for what they've done, the damage that they've done, not just for myself and Grace, but all those victims, all those people.

'They've defrauded whole families, just destroyed their dreams for their families' futures. I want my daughter to go to university, she's a bright girl.

'They've left us with nothing. I know money doesn't make you happy, but obviously you think about your future and your family's future.

'Some people think that being defrauded means that they're stupid people. But they couldn't possibly have known that they were being defrauded like that.'
