England captain Steven Gerrard might be considering his international future over the summer, but it looked the last thing on his mind as he enjoyed a dip in the sea with his wife Alex in Ibiza.

The Liverpool hero is considering quitting the England scene to focus on increased club commitments on Merseyside but Roy Hodgson looking to convince him to stay on the midfielder's decision is not yet made.

In the meantime, and before beginning his heavy early season schedule with Liverpool, Gerrard has been enjoying some downtime with his wife in Ibiza.

The 34-year-old has been given so much deserved time off before Liverpool return for pre season training later this month.

And Gerrard will be determined to make it a season to remember after such a disappointing end to the last as Liverpool let the title slip from their grasp.

And Gerrard will have heard the news from the beach that he will have reinforcements joining him in the title bid - with Emre Can completing his Â£9.8million move on Wednesday.
