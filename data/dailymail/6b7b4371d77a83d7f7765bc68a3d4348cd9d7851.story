Dramatic footage of a distressed toddler being rescued by helicopter from a submerged vehicle reveal the extent of severe flooding in eastern Australia following torrential rain from Cyclone Oswald.

The young child and two women were winched to safety after their truck was stuck in quickly rising flood waters in the east Australian town of Biloela, Queensland, yesterday.

One man has died and two others are reported missing after heavy rain and tornado winds swept across the region, bringing an abrupt end to the heat wave and causing severe disruptions to millions of people celebrating a long bank holiday weekend in celebration of Australia Day.

Distressed: A distraught toddler is air-lifted to safety from the back of a deluged truck after torrential rain from Cyclone Oswald devastated parts of Queensland, Australia

Authorities say around 58,000 houses were without electricity, hundreds of homes were under water and several towns were completely isolated by the flood water.

The Army has been called in 
to rescue terrified families trapped on their roofs by flood waters 
after rivers burst their banks, but further danger has come from coastal
 areas where wild seas have pounded houses and flooded parks.

The extent of the impact of Cyclone Oswarld is only expected to get worse, however, as forecasters warn the bad weather is heading south towards Brisbane, the state capital of Queensland

Towns within hundreds of miles of the city have been placed on tornado watch as the cyclone makes its way south.

Forecasters say it is due to hit New South Wales' capital Sydney tomorrow.

In Biloela yesterday, rescues by helicopters and boats were caught on camera by emergency services' head-cams and aired on local television channel Network Seven today.

Deluged: Two women, one holding a small child, are seen stranded in their flooded truck, waiting for help

Rescue: One woman reaches out to steady the man suspended from the helicopters winch, while the other protects the child from the down draft

Stranded: Holding on tight to the child, the women look relieved to see help arrive

Cramped: The three were only inches away from the raging flood water as it swelled around their vehicle

The footage shows two women in the back of a submerged truck, reaching out to steady the rescuer as he is lowered on a winch from the helicopter.

Clearly distressed, they put the crying infant in a waterproof bag which was then lifted up to the safety of the helicopter. Reassuring the two women, the rescuer repeatedly tells them he will come back for them both.

Inside the helicopter, the bag is unzipped and the crying child emerges, distraught but safe. 

Further footage shows an elderly woman being rescued from her marooned houseboat, which has taken a battering from the storms and is drifting.

In the town of Bundaberg, the Spinnaker Flood Bar  was flooded for the second time after it was inundated due to severe floods that hit Queensland in 2011.

Protection: The women carefully place the child into a waterproof black bag

Distressed: The women lower the child into the bag, which is attached to the helicopter winch

Unsure: The child loos up at the rescuer who is attached by a harness to the noisy helicopter hovering overhead

Distressed: The child looks terrified as the women try to zip him into the bag

Steady: The women look on concerned as the child is winched up in the black bag to the helicopter overhead

'I don't know if we'll come back from this. It will probably finish us to be honest with you,' said restaurant owner Brett Jensen.

Deadly snakes, forced from their bushland habitat, have added a further threat to householders who have been wading through flood waters that have risen throughout most of the east coast of Queensland and northern New South Wales.

‘There’s no end in sight – it’s going to get worse,’ warned an emergency services spokesman.

Tens of thousands of holidaymakers, who headed to camping areas and seaside resorts to enjoy the Australia Day long weekend found themselves fleeing from the rain and the floods, their vehicles causing chaos on major roads.

Entire houses disappeared under floodwater as rivers burst their banks and the town of Mundubbera, 225 miles north of Brisbane, was cut in two after the Burnett River rose 7ft above a road bridge.

Relief: The women give the thumbs up as the child is winched safely up away from the submerged truck

Safety: In the helicopter the child is handed over to a second rescuer

Terrified: the whole experience has clearly been terrifying for the small child

Reassuring: The man on the winch gives the child a reassuring pat on the head before returning down to rescue the two women from the truck

‘We’ve got a bit of a fight on our hands,’ said councillor Faye Whelan of Mundubbera when the river reached 63ft, 3ft 3in above the devastating levels of 2010 – and late today it was still rising.

'Houses that had been inundated in the 2010 floods have been washed out again, with several people trapped on their roofs.'

The body of an elderly man has been pulled from waters at Burnett Heads – and two other people have been reported missing in flood waters in Maryborough and Gympie, north of Brisbane.

Three families remained stranded on rooftops at Widgee, near Gympie, today and winds were too strong to mount a rescue by helicopter.

Emergency services said they had carried out at least 21 ‘swift water’ rescues, with five people being pulled from flooded drains.

Brisbane: Some streets were already flooded in the central business district of Brisbane on Sunday

In a grim summary of events in Queensland, state Premier Campbell Newman said that at least 40 houses had been inundated around the Gladstone region alone.

Flood levels are expected to easily exceed 2010 levels in Bundaberg, famous for its rum, where at least 300 homes have been inundated.

In the town of Gympie a 17-year-old man has been reported missing in flood waters, while in Maryborough authorities are searching for a young woman who reportedly drove her car into flood waters, hoping to get through to the other side.

On the Sunshine Coast tens of thousands of homes are without power after power lines were brought down, while south of Brisbane the famous Gold Coast region is expected to be hit by heavy rain and winds of up to 80mph.
