For days when an ordinary egg timer simply won't do, there's the one which plays different songs when your breakfast is cooked to varying states.

Firebox's BeepEgg comes in three varieties - Original, Disco Diva and Rock God - each of which has three different melodies, which play when your egg has reached varying stages of hardness - soft, medium and hard - alerting you when to take your egg out of the hot water.

Songs piped through the quirky £14.99 gimmick include Killing Me Softly, The Final Countdown, Smoke On The Water, Celebration, That's The Way and Last Night a DJ Saved My Life.

The BeepEgg takes the temperature of the water and measures the internal temperature of the egg

The BeepEgg plays three different tunes to indicate that your egg is cooked to varying degrees of hardness

The BeepEgg beeps once when the water reaches approx 45°C (to show it's working), once when the water starts to boil, then begins to play its songs as the egg cooks.

Its internal thermostat continually measures the water temperature and calculates the inner temperature of the eggs - that’s why you need to put it in the water with the egg.
