Two comic-style novels have been shortlisted for the prestigious Costa Book Awards for the first time.

One is the story of a heavy metal-loving teenager forced to spend all summer with his mother and the other is a graphic novel biography of James Joyce's daughter.

'Days of the Bagnold Summer' by Joff Winterhart and 'Dotter of Her Father's Eyes' by husband and wife Mary and Bryan Talbot are among 20 books nominated across five categories.

Nominated: Mary and Bryan Talbot have been shortlisted in the biography category of the Costa Book Awards for their illustrated memoir about James Joyce's daughter, Lucia

Graphic novel: The Talbot's book, Dotter of her Father's Eyes, was one of two comic-style books nominated this year

The overall winner, to be announced on January 29, wins £30,000, while the category winners receive £5,000.

Also nominated is the latest novel by double Man Booker Prize winner Hilary Mantel, 'Bring Up The Bodies'.

Earlier this year, Mantel, 60, became the first British writer to win the Booker Prize twice for her historical novels on Thomas Cromwell.

'Bring Up The Bodies' is nominated in the Best Novel category, alongside Winterhart's graphic novel, Stephen May's 'Life! Death! Prizes!' and James Meek's 'The Heart Broke In.'

Winterhart's graphic novel tells the story of the Bagnolds - librarian mother Sue and her 15-year-old heavy metal fan son, Daniel. 

Daniel is supposed to be visiting his father and pregnant stepmother in the United States but the trip is cancelled at the last minute, leaving mother and son to spend the summer together.

Sue knows she can't communicate with Daniel, who looks 'like a big, black, sad kangaroo' and the illustrations bring across these generational difficulties in a heart-tugging way.

Winterhart, 38, was extremely surprised to receive a nomination: 'It doesn't feel like a novel, it's got pictures in it!

'I didn't know it had enough words to constitute a novel. Some novels are quite epic and very cinematic in scope and mine is incredibly not like that.'

Delightful illustrations: Two examples of the cartoons drawn by Bryan Talbot in 'Dotter of Her Father's Eyes'

Wendy Holden, one of the category's three judges, said it was funny, thought-provoking and 'sniff-makingly sad'.

She added: 'Anyone with a teenager in the family, or anticipating having one in the future, should read it.

'It's not only hilarious and brilliant but deals with real life, as people really live it.'

Strong competition: Winterhart will go up against Booker Prize-winning Hilary Mantel's 'Bring Up The Bodies'

Nominated novels: 'The heart Broke In' by James Meek and 'Life! Death! Prizes!' by Stephen May are also in the Novel category shortlist

The Talbot's work is an illustrated biography-cum-memoir of Joyce's daughter Lucia, which also draws on Mary Talbot's personal memories of her troubled relationship with her father, the Joycean scholar James S Atherton.

The judges called it ' a strikingly original graphic memoir which links two lives in a highly imaginative way.'

It will compete in the Biography category alongside 'Patrick Leigh-Fermor: An Adventure' by Artemis Cooper, 'The Crocodile By The Door' by Selina Guinness and 'Serving Victoria' by Kate Hubbard.
