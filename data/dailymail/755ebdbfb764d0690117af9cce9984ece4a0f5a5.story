Everton have suffered a major blow ahead of the start of the new season after Ross Barkley was ruled out for between six to eight weeks.

The England international, who recently committed his future to his boyhood club by signing a new four-year deal, has suffered a knee ligament injury in training and his absence will cause a major headache for manager Roberto Martinez.

Barkley was hurt during training at the club's Finch Farm headquarters on Friday and was seen leaving with his leg in a supportive brace.

The midfielder must now undergo scans to determine how long he will be on the sidelines. The best case scenario is that he will be able to return within six weeks but, even still, he will be a big miss for Everton, who have a demanding opening to the campaign that includes assignments against Chelsea and Arsenal before the end of the month.

If Barkley is out for eight weeks, however, he will miss Everton's return to Europe on September 18, as well as the first Merseyside derby at Anfield on September 27. Not only that, he will be ruled out of England's forthcoming friendly against Norway at Wembley and the opening Euro 2016 qualifier against Switzerland.

There is no indication yet whether Barkley requires surgery to correct the damage, which was suffered in an accidental collision. That, however, will be no solace to Martinez, who has frequently championed Barkley's ability and made the 20-year-old one of the key figures in his starting line-up.
