A young girl is seen crying and screaming in a video her mother took after she claims a pharmacy mixed up her daughter's prescription.

Coleen McDougall, of Corona, California, filmed as her 12-year-old daughter Riley experienced what she says were bizarre hallucinations after taking the sleeping pill Ambien instead of the antibiotic she had been prescribed.

McDougall says the pharmacy gave her daughter the wrong pills.

'She was pulling the stair railing, trying to pull it off the wall thinking that it was a curtain and it shouldn't be there,' McDougall told NBC 4 of her daughter's hallucinations. 

Concerned and scared, she took Riley to the emergency room, where doctors said the girl was likely having a reaction to some bad Sudafed, which the girl was taking for a cold.

The same thing happened again however the next time McDougall gave Riley what she thought was her antibiotic.

'Within 20 minutes she was seeing double vision,' claims McDougall.

That is when she said she called the pharmacy, and was told upon describing the pills; 'Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry. It's Ambien.'

Now, McDougall is taking legal action against the CVS in Corona, California (above) that gave her daughter the powerful sleeping pill

Now, McDougall is taking legal action against the CVS that gave her daughter the powerful sleeping pill.

'This is pure negligence. They have protocols in place to prevent these things from happening,' said the family's attorney, Jeffrey Greenman. 

CVS would not comment on pending litigation, but did say in a statement; 'The health and safety of our customers is our number one priority and we have policies and procedures in place to ensure prescription safety.'
