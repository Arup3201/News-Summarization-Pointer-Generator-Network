Newcastle legend Kevin Keegan has launched a stinging attack on his former club after their dismal 5-0 defeat by Manchester City at the weekend.

Newcastle are languishing in 11th-place in the Premier League table and still only 10 points clear of the relegation they could well get dragged into a scrap to avoid the drop.

Keegan, who has had two spells as manager and played for the club for two years in the early 1980s, does not believe that current manager John Carver will remain in charge in the summer and has become disillusioned with the way they are being run by controversial owner Mike Ashley.

Keegan believes John Carver is a valuable asset to Newcastle - but won't be the club's manager next season 

Keegan, working as a pundit on beIN SPORT when he made the comments, said: ‘It hurts me to say it but Newcastle are a club going nowhere.’ 

He added: ‘John Carver is valuable to have around the place but he won’t be manager next season.’

Newcastle players were made to sit through their Etihad Stadium horror show for a second time when a video of their 5-0 pasting was played to them at the club’s training ground.
