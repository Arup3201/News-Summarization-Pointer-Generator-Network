Clambering from branch to branch as quick as lightning, this tiny frog is desperately trying to escape the jaws of a predatory snake.

Using a plant thread as a ladder, the red eyed tree frog manages to clamber up the the safety of the branches away from the predators of the forest floor.

These incredible images were taken by photographer Nicolas Reusens, 37, on a visit to El Arenal Volcano in Costa Rica.

He said: 'This particular photograph was a very difficult capture to achieve, these frogs are always moving.

'This one was in a hurry climbing those threads as she was exposed to snakes and other predators.'

Red eyed tree frogs, otherwise known as agalychnis callidryas, often rely on camouflage to protect themselves.

During the day, they stay motionless, cover their blue sides with their back legs, tuck their feet under their stomachs, and shut their eyes.

When doing this, they can make themselves appear almost completely green, and well hidden among the plants and grass they live in.

Nicolas said: 'They are nocturnal so during day times they tend to hide and rest under big banana leafs.

'Everybody loves tree frog pictures even more if they are different and original, not the usual tree frog on a flower perch.

Tiny: Red eye tree frogs grow to a little under 8cm at the most. Here the frog is seen sitting on some coins to illustrate its diminutive size

'For this one I think I was just in the right place the right time, when I got this shot I was made up.

'I've always had a sharp eye for nature and been fascinated by insects.

'One of the greatest satisfactions of photography is traveling around the world and "capturing" the weird and wonderful creatures and being able to show them to the public.'

The frogs, which grow to a maximum of just under 8cm, are native to South America.
