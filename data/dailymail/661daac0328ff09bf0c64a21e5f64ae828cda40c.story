House prices are rising faster than at any point since before the financial crash, making it even harder for people to get on to the housing ladder.

Average property values soared by 12.1 per cent in the year to September, a level not seen since July 2007, according to new figures.

And prices paid by first-time buyers are growing even faster, up 13.3 per cent in a year – the highest since March 2005.

In recent months there have been claims that the property market was cooling.

There were also doubts that areas outside London would see prices rocket by the same dramatic levels seen in the capital.

But latest data from the Office for National Statistics show double-digit growth in four regions of the UK.

The ONS said house prices are continuing to 'increase strongly across the UK, with prices in London again showing the highest growth'.

Values in London have increased by 18.8 per cent over the last year to reach £508,000 on average.

The East saw the next highest annual price growth, with values there lifting by 13.4 per cent over the 12 months, which is the strongest year-on-year increase seen in the East since August 2003.

The average house price across the UK stood at £273,000 in September, which is £1,000 lower than an all-time high recorded in August.

But it is still nearly 12 per cent higher than typical values during the previous peak of the market in 2008, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.

A typical first-time buyer faces having to pay 13.3 per cent more to get on to the property ladder than they did a year ago.

This is the highest annual price increase for first-time buyers since March 2005.

Someone climbing the first rung of the property ladder now needs to pay £209,000 on average.

The average price of a home in London is £507,833, almost double the UK average of £272,952

Campbell Robb, chief executive of charity Shelter, said: 'Despite talk of a cooling market, these new figures show yet another rise in house prices and therefore yet another rise in the number of young people and families left priced out of a home of their own.

'Average house prices in England are now almost 10 times the average wage. Even if they stop increasing at the astronomical rates we've seen over the past year, buying a home is still a pipe-dream for those on average incomes, who remain stuck in the 'rent trap', unable to save for a deposit.

'The only way to bring home ownership back within reach of ordinary people is for politicians to commit to build more genuinely affordable homes.'

However, there are signs that the pace of house price growth is softening. The ONS said that in a number of regions, including London, prices have fallen back from the record levels seen in August.

On a month-on-month basis, prices across the UK increased by 0.5 per cent between August and September, which is a smaller uplift than a 0.8 per cent monthly rise recorded in August.

Over the last year, prices have increased by 12.5 per cent in England to reach £285,000, by 5.8 per cent in Wales to reach £172,000, by 7.6 per cent in Scotland to reach £197,000, and by 10.9 per cent in Northern Ireland to reach £143,000.

House prices in England and Scotland remain above their pre-financial crisis peaks of 2008 but have dipped slightly compared with their levels in August.

Values in Northern Ireland are still sitting 45 per cent below their pre-financial crisis high, while those in Wales are just below their previous peak, which was recorded in January 2008, the ONS said.

Toughened mortgage lending rules came into force across the industry in April under the Mortgage Market Review (MMR), which has caused some disruption to the market.

But in recent weeks, lenders have unleashed some of their lowest ever mortgage rates on to the market as they look to meet end-of-year targets. Swap rates, which influence how lenders price their mortgages, have also been falling.

Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said the ONS figures show 'there is still plenty of momentum left in the market'.

He said: 'Swap rates remain low and lenders are keen to make up for lost ground caused by implementing the Mortgage Market Review. As a consequence, there are some excellent fixed and tracker rates available.

'With the spring likely to be a challenge for the housing market ahead of the general election, lenders will continue offering fantastic deals to entice buyers and those remortgaging.'

Despite skyrocketing house prices, there are some steps you can take to keep a lid on the cost of buying a house.

For a start, getting the right mortgage is essential to making sure buying a home is as affordable as possible.

Rates recently fell to a new low and there are hundreds, if not thousands, of options out there. So, as well as doing your own research, this is an occasion to search out expert opinion from a good mortgage broker.
