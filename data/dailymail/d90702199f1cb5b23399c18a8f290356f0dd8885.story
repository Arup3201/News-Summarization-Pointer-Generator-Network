Two teenagers have been arrested after a dying woman was robbed of her wedding ring at a Taco Bell drive thru.

Danielle Zimmerman, 43, went to the restaurant in Wichita, Kansas, on Sunday night to collect dinner for her family when she suffered the brain aneurysm and smashed into the speaker box.

The woman's purse, iPhone and ring from her finger were stolen as passersby and emergency crews arrived to help her.

According to the The Wichita Eagle, police have arrested two men and are seeking a third in connection to the crime.

The website said, although police have not named the suspects, jail records show they are Daquantrius Shaquill Johnson and Quanique Dontrell Thomas-Hameen, both 19.

Johnson was being held on criminal possession of a firearm, robbery and violating bail. Thomas-Hameen was being held on suspicion of robbery and traffic charges, the report suggested.

The story caused outcry across the states when news broke of the horrific treatment of Mrs Zimmerman.

'Instead of trying to help her, somebody robbed her,' her distraught husband of 21 years, Kris, told the Wichita Eagle.

'What really appalled me - the wedding ring. How could you take somebody’s wedding ring off their finger?'

After the crash, about nine people gathered around the car and found her unconscious. Her husband said that he had heard a hospital worker from nearby was trying to help her.

Her husband believes that one of the people there must have seen the theft and now he hopes someone will 'stand up
 and do the right thing'.

Local pawn shops have been advised of what the ring looks like in case it is brought to them. The family said it does not care about recovering her cash or phone - they just want the ring.

'We would like to get the ring back more than anything,' Mrs Zimmerman's cousin told KWCH.

'I would like to say some things to the people that did this... but more than anything, I want there to be some kind of closure for Kris and her boys.'

The purse, including photos of her two teenage sons, has been found by children sledding near to the Taco Bell. The thief took $150 and credit cards from inside.

Mr Zimmerman was watching football and waiting for his wife to return home with dinner, which they were to share with one of their sons, 13, and his friend.

After 30 minutes, he called her to no answer, and 15 minutes later, he decided to go and find her. But as he was leaving his driveway, police arrived and told him his wife was in the hospital.

There, a chaplain told him that she 
had suffered a serious aneurysm - although she had never had one before -
 and that she had blood on her brain.

It was also at the hospital that he learned all of his wife's belongings were missing.

On Monday, her family made the decision to switch off her life support. Her organs were prepared for donation.

Mr Zimmerman said he is still in shock that he lost his wife so young in what he called a 'fluke of nature'.

'She was easy-going, fun,' he said. 'We could finish each other’s thought. We were just the perfect match really. And she was a great mother and great wife.'

Mrs Zimmerman leaves behind two sons, Noah, 13, and Alex, 18.
