With a fragile economic recovery to protect, rows over Europe to navigate, not to mention a looming general election, it is undeniable the new year presents David Cameron with a host of challenges.

But last night the Prime Minister jokingly revealed that, in 2014, priority 'number one' is keeping a tight rein on his bald patch.

In an address to political journalists at the Westminster Correspondents dinner, held last night at the House of Commons, Mr Cameron poked fun at his thinning hair while making jibes about Ed Balls, Boris Johnson and the rebel MPs within his party.

He told the assembled journalists that he was ready to announce 'my priorities for the year ahead', before continuing 'number one - keeping the bald spot under control.'

The fresh attention on the Prime Ministerial hairdo comes after the New Year's honours list featured Mr Cameron's hairdresser, Lino Carbosiero, who received an MBE for 'services to hairdressing'.

Mr Carosiero, who cuts and styles the Prime Minister's hair for Â£90 a time and is held responsible for his trademark side-parting, came in for another round of praise last night, though Mr Cameron insisted he did not know about the award in advance.

He said: 'If you can make cuts and
 stop recession at the same time, you deserve an honour.'

Mr Cameron's bald spot has been the subject of media speculation for some time.

It has been photographed on occasion since he took over as the leader of the Conservative party in 2005, though it is often skilfully covered.

The dinner at which Mr Cameron was speaking, held in the Members' dining room in the House of Commons, is a smaller-scale version of the White House Correspondents' dinner held by the President each year. It is the first to be held in 1974.

Commenting on his grand surroundings - and making a reference to his past as a member of the notorious Bullingdon Club while he was at Oxford, Mr Cameron said: 'The last time I was at a dinner this posh, Boris [Johnson] spent the rest of the night in prison.'

He also recalled a tense moment out campaigning with Mr Johnson when a woman who answered the door seemed to accuse the London mayor of fathering her child.

According to the Prime Minister, she said: ''Boris, you're the father of one of my children.'

But she quickly revealed that it was a joke by clarifying: 'It's your daughter, I'm her maths teacher.'

Mr Cameron also made light of troubles within his own party, saying that a rebellious letter sent to him by backbench MPs demanding the power to veto EU laws never actually materialised.

He told his audience: 'The only problem was that there was no letter, they didn't send it and it didn't have 95 signatures'.

However, one backbencher, Penny Mordaunt, came in for praise from the Prime Minister after she decided to appear on ITV's Splash!, hosted by Tom Daley, to raise money for charity.

He said: 'If every Tory MP who's taken their clothes off in recent years had had such noble intentions, we would be in a much better position.'

And, in an apparent spirit of generosity, Mr Cameron also took time to find common ground with one of his fiercest critics - Labour shadow chancellor Ed Balls.

He pointed out: 'We both love The Sound of Music, we both love Delia Smith - for different reasons - and we both like the Antiques Roadshow.

'I like it for the heartwarming stories, Ed likes it when they sell the family silver.'

The Prime Minister finished his address by praising the 'tenacious... often uncomfortable' nature of the British Press, which he made clear is vital to preserve democracy.

He said: 'At its best, the British press and the political press has a vital role to play in our country,' said the Prime Minister.

'Tenacious, uncontrollable, sceptical, often uncomfortable for us politicians, British political reporting is deservedly respected around the world for the way it probes, inquires and scrutinises. These things are lynchpins of our democracy.'
