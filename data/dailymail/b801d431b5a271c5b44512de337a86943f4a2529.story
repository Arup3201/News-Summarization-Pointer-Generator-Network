This incredible image shows two male giraffes battling it out to win a female - but they look more like they are doing the tango.

The 18 foot tall thornicroft giraffes appear to be 'dancing' with each other in what is usually a test of male dominance and mating rights. Giraffes are considered 'gentle giants' but often engage in bruising fights until a single giraffe is left standing. They can even end in death.

The beautiful photographs, shot in South Luangwa National Park in Zambia, were taken by photographer Dana Allen.

Dance-off: Two male giraffes who went hoof to hoof in bid to win a female companion look more like they're dancing than engaging in deadly combat in these stunning images. In a giraffe fight, males stand side-by-side, pushing and shoving to judge which is the strongest. This pair are young bucks and are testing the other's prowess

Photographer Dana Allen said: 'Because of their great size, their actions seemed to be carried out in slow motion and their seemingly synchronized movements gave the impression of a well choreographed ballet'

He said: 'They were both young bulls and they were testing each other's strength and skill. I watched them for nearly two hours as they tried to butt with their horns and head and tried to knock the other off balance by hooking their legs out from under them.

'Because of their great size, their actions seemed to be carried out in slow motion and their seemingly synchronized movements gave the impression of a well choreographed ballet.'

He added: 'Eventually the winner left with a female giraffe.'

Eastern and Central African regions for the past 25 years.

Dana used a Nikon D3S to capture the moment. He said: 'They were pretty close up, but they posed no threat to me.'

Giraffes are commonly seen as gentle creatures, but their courtship rites involve bruising and ferocious physical battles for dominance

Vicious dance: The pictures were shot in South Luangwa National Park in Zambia. Shuddering blows are sometimes exchanged using the giraffes' powerful necks

Spoils: The victor of the fight won the female for breeding, while the loser hobbled away to lick his wounds

Show of force: Often, the battles are abandoned after a short tussle, but they can degenerate into a fight to the death
