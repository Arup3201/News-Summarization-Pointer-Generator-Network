Thomas Kinkade's widow and girlfriend have reached a settlement after a dispute over the late artist's $66 million estate, their attorneys said on Wednesday.

The San Jose Mercury News reports that counsel for Nanette Kinkade and his girlfriend Amy Pinto announced the settlement but wouldn't provide further details, leaving it unclear who will inherit Kinkade's San Francisco Bay area mansion and his warehouse of paintings.

In a statement, they said the women kept Kinkade's message of 'love, spirituality and optimism' in their amicable resolution.

Mistress: Amy Pinto, who began dating Kinkade six months after his marriage of 28 years imploded, said the man Kinkade wrote two notes bequeathing her his mansion and $10 million

The famous artist Thomas Kinkade's signature has been appearing on new paintings, despite his death last year

The dispute went public after the 54-year-old artist died on April 6 from an accidental overdose of alcohol and prescription tranquilizers.

Pinto, who began dating Kinkade six months after his marriage of 28 years imploded, claimed Kinkade wrote two notes bequeathing her his mansion and $10 million to establish a museum of his paintings.

The barely legible note read: ‘I, Thomas Kinkade, being 
of sound mind and body do hereby bequeath to Amy Pinto $10,000,000
in cash from my corporate policy.’

He
also wrote that Pinto should have his two properties on 
Ridgecrest Avenue ‘for her security'. It is signed and dated November 
18, 2011.

Nanette
Kinkade disputed those claims and sought full control of the 
estate.

His estate - of which Mrs Kinkade is 
the principal trustee - has filed documents with a Santa Clara court 
seeking an injunction against Ms Pinto.

Will and testament: The will was written on notepaper and is barely legible

In April, lawyers portrayed Mr 
Kinkade's girlfriend as a ruthless gold digger who was out to 'tear down'
the late artist's reputation and do irreparable damage to his family.

Lawyers for Pinto filed court papers stating that she and Kinkade had planned to marry as soon as his divorce went through.

But despite the acrimonious battle of the summer, the two parties said they have put their differences aside in honor of the memory of Kinkade.

'Putting Mr. Kinkade's message of love, spirituality, and optimism at the forefront, the parties are pleased that they have honored Mr. Kinkade by resolving their differences amicably,' they said in a joint statement on Wednesday.

No details of the settlement were made public.

Painter of light: Mr Kinkade's talent, shown here in Living Waters: Golfer's Paradise, Hole One is a characteristic of his serene style that put roughly one of his paintings in every 20 homes

Father: Mr Kinkade, pictured here drawing his daughter Winsor, was said by his brother to have been cleaning himself up to remain in his children's lives

Kinkade, the self-described 'Painter of Light,' was known for sentimental scenes of country gardens and pastoral landscapes.

His work led to a commercial empire of franchised galleries, reproduced artwork and spin-off products that was said to fetch some $100 million each year in sales.

It is estimated that one in every 20 homes in American contains a piece an artwork by the 'Painter of Light'.

Mr Kinkade died of accidental acute intoxication from alcohol
and an anti-anxiety medication  at his home in Northern California at the age of 54.

The
Santa Clara County Coroner's Office reported Kinkade's cause of death 
as 'acute ethanol and Diazepam intoxication' and manner of death as 
'accident.'

Success: Mr Kinkade's works were popular, but his battle with alcoholism led him to an arrest for DUI (right)

Diazepam is the active ingredient in name-brand drug Valium.

Kinkade, whose work captivated 
millions of Americans despite the scorn of many art critics, died in 
April

According to a coroner’s report, the painter suffered from ‘hypertensive and atherosclerotic heart disease.’

His
brother said that the painter had 
battled alcoholism for several years and suffered a relapse before he 
died.

Patrick Kinkade said 
his brother had been burdened in recent years by a separation from his 
wife, financial troubles and the low opinion of his work by critics.

Thomas Kinkade was arrested for drunk driving in 2010, the same year his company filed for bankruptcy.

Art galleries reported a surge in sales of Kinkade's paintings following his death.
