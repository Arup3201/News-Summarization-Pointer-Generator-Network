Former defence secretary Liam Fox has seen the Prime Minister's speech

Voters want a return to the Common Market, one of the Conservative Party's leading Eurosceptics told David Cameron yesterday today ahead of the Prime Minister's long-awaited speech on Britain's future in the EU.

Former defence secretary Liam Fox said Britain should be aiming to return to a 'basic economic relationship' with Brussels, which people backed in a referendum in 1975.

Dr Fox said he had seen the Prime Minister's speech -- expected to be delivered on Wednesday after being postponed because of the Algeria hostage crisis -- and believed it would be an historic moment.

'If that is the speech that is finally delivered, a great many of us will think that it's a speech that we've been waiting a long time for any Prime Minister to deliver,' he said.

Mr Cameron will promise, if re-elected with a majority, to renegotiate a looser, more trade-based relationship with the EU and then hold an 'in/out' referendum, expected to take place in 2017 or 2018.

The Prime Minister is also expected to say that Britain now rejects the aim of 'ever closer union' that was at the heart of the EU's founding principles.

However, Mr Cameron will stress that he wants Britain to remain as a strong voice at the heart of a reformed EU - and will campaign for a 'yes' vote in the referendum, as long as significant powers are returned.

Diplomats believe there will be an opportunity to demand repatriation in key areas in exchange for allowing the Eurozone countries to forge a closer economic and political union in response to the debt crisis on the Continent.

Labour and the Liberal Democrats have
so far rejected the idea of a referendum -- insisting that to announce 
one now risks damaging investment by creating uncertainty about 
Britain's future in the EU.

That stance won surprise backing 
yesterday from Michael Portillo, who served as Conservative defence 
secretary under John Major and was a notorious Eurosceptic during his 
time in power.

'To commit himself to an in/out 
referendum in the mid term of his next government seems to me to be 
extraordinarily dangerous,' Mr Portillo told Sky's Murnaghan programme.

'People like to kick their government in the teeth.'

Foreign Secretary William Hague insisted there was a 'strong case' for a referendum, saying 'fresh consent' was necessary for Britain's membership of the EU.

'We want to succeed in the European Union - we want an outward-looking EU to succeed in the world, and for the United Kingdom to succeed in that,' he told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme.

'But we have to recognise that the European Union has changed a lot since the referendum of 1975 and that there have been not only great achievements to the EU's name but some things that have gone badly wrong, such as the euro.'

Dr Fox said he was 'broadly satisfied' with the Prime Minister's proposals.

'I think ultimately there has to be an in/out referendum, because otherwise we're going to have our politics in Britain constantly undermined by this debate. And I think it's very important that we settle one way or another the European argument for a generation,' he told the BBC's Sunday Politics.

'I would like to see us with a basic economic relationship, and I think, yes, I think that people in Britain voted in the 1975 referendum for a Common Market, and that's what we expected to be delivered.

'I think certainly for myself, my preference would be to have a renegotiated relationship. [But] if we were put into a position where the British people didn't like any renegotiated solution and decided to be outside, a lot of countries do exist outside the European Union. It would have undoubtedly some difficulties for us, but I don't think they could not be overcome.'

Andrea Leadsom, founder of the Fresh Start group of around 120 Tory MPs who have drawn up a shopping list of powers to be returned, said the party was 'hugely united'.

She said most MPs favoured a renegotiated relationship and that the number who wanted to leave the EU come what may could be 'counted on the fingers of two hands'.

UKIP leader Nigel Farage said there was no prospect of his party, which saw its support slump in polls yesterday following news of Mr Cameron's plans, doing a deal with the Conservatives despite the proposed EU referendum.

'I think with David Cameron as leader that is virtually impossible to even contemplate,' he said.

'Mr Cameron, whenever he's asked about UKIP, just throws abuse at us and calls us nutters and closet racists, so I don't think there's any prospect of us doing a deal with the Conservative Party with Mr Cameron in charge.'

On the chances of local deals with sympathetic Tory candidates, he said: 'It may happen but it's not my priority.'

Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander insisted Mr Cameron's speech had 'more to do with the politics of the Conservative Party...than actually to do with the national interest'.

'Why has the speech been delayed for more than a year? David Cameron I would suggest was actually rendered speechless because of the gap between what his backbenchers will tolerate and what European partners will give him.'

Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg threw Labour's position on a referendum into further confusion when he suggested the party would 'never' rule one out.

The outgoing US ambassador to Britain, Louis Susman, said the relationship between our two countries 'couldn't be any stronger' and would not be affected by an EU referendum.

'This does not affect the special relationship. We believe in a strong EU, we can't imagine a strong EU without a vibrant partner in the UK and that's what we hope will come about but it's up to the British people to decide what they want,' he said.
