Want to try your banana trick shot? What better place than this completely potty, fruit-shaped pool table?

The bright yellow gaming table is the work of British artist Cléon Daniel.

The 25-year-old from Dorset roped in a family friend to help construct what he has dubbed BananaPool.

Cléon previously put out a well-received book called of hilarious drawings for zany designs called'Unventions'.

He explains: 'I've always had ideas and made things, it's over the past couple of years that I've hadopportunity to take things further.

'The book was doing well and this encouraged me to keep developing my work, it was around thistime I had the idea for Banana Pool.

The curved 8.5ft-long games table in bright yellow adds a unique new dimension to the game

'The idea came to me in a matter of minutes on the train; I have the page in my notebook where Isort of lucidly scribbled it down.

'I was working on some ideas around decay and ageing, thought how many different signs/patternsthere are for this in nature, and how life's journey, although leading to the same thing is affectedalong the way by environment and intervention, like a game.

'I thought of a banana and imagined something extrinsic pushing the spots around on it and how thepattern could be used differently, and it just clicked.'

Eye catching: With the frame ready the bright yellow felt is laid to out to be cut to size

The resulting design was for an 8.5ft-long games table in bright yellow.

'I approached an old family friend and retired carpenter in April last year with the table idea, he wasamused, and happy to help me make it.

'Work started in May in his workshop in Dorset and I juggled as many afternoon and odd days perweek in the workshop with freelance photography jobs for about 9 months.

Taking shape: Inventor Cléon had the idea for the table during a train trip

Final touches: The metal work for the pockets had to be custom made to fit the unique shape

'There was no clear or accurate plan, we just took it step by step, the legs had to be pentagonal, andthe shape had to be right, I spent a lot of time perfecting it by hand on a massive sheet of ply, andclimbing up a ladder to check.

'We had a lot of laughs making it. My uncle kept complaining how 'nothing's straight forward with this'and 'you're bloody mad that's your problem'.

'As it started to take shape it was strange to walk round, the shape is so unexpected at certainangles, it seems to command attention.
