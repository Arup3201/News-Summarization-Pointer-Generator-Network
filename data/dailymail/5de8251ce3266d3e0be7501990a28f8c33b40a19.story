James Forrest could miss Celtic’s Champions League qualifiers as Ronny Deila seeks to resolve the player’s fitness issues once and for all.

The winger netted the last-gasp goal that defeated Shakhter Karagandy and sealed a £15million jackpot in last season’s group stages.

But a thigh problem has become the latest issue in a catalogue of injury and illness experienced by the 22-year-old over the past two years.

Deila views Forrest as an outstanding talent but will take all the time required to help him back into peak condition before selecting him for action.

Celtic face Russian side FK Krasnodar in their first pre-season friendly this evening, with their European qualifier against KR Reykjavik just 12 days away.

‘James is out for some weeks,’ said Deila. ‘We will see what happens in terms of the qualifiers. We will take it from week to week.

‘I don’t want to rush James. He has been out for such a long time that he needs time to get his fitness up. I saw in training that he didn’t have the fitness needed to be consistent.

‘When he is fit, then he can start playing games. He is a very explosive player. When you are in and out, you can push too hard to get back and end up having to start all over again.

‘It’s very important that we take our time with him and get out his potential. If it continues the way of the last year or two then that will never happen because of all the injuries.

‘It’s better to keep him out for a good while now to really get him fit. From there, we can get him into games. James is an exceptional talent but you need that fitness to play game after game. The medical staff know what to do with him. It’s just about getting the time to do it.’

Get that sorted, please! New Celtic boss Ronny Deila is refusing to rush Forrest back into action

Deila is targeting a new wide player as Derk Boerrigter has also been frequently injured since arriving at Celtic from Ajax last summer.

‘It’s similar with Derk,’ he added. ‘He has been out for a long time but is working well. He seems okay but when you have been out for a long time it can take months to get on the same level again.

‘Derk and James are the quickest wingers we have. Last season, a lot of midfielders were used in wide positions. Finding another winger is something we will look at.’

Craig Gordon is, however, poised to become Deila’s first signing. The Norwegian revealed earlier this week that a deal for the ex-Scotland goalkeeper was close and it is now expected to be finalised within the next 48 hours.

The Celtic boss has also insisted Celtic could afford Stromsgodset prodigy Martin Odegaard – but he has no immediate plan to move for the 15-year-old midfielder.

Deila promoted the talented teenager into first team football while in charge at the Norwegian club. Odegaard – who has trained with Manchester United and Bayern Munich – has expressed a wish to work with his old manager again in the future. But Deila’s successor David Nielsen claimed he was too pricey for Celtic and would end up with Barcelona.

‘It’s incorrect to say that Martin is outwith our range,’ Deila told Norwegian TV. ‘Martin must do what is best for him and we will do what is best for us - we’ll see if our paths meet at a later date.

‘Martin is a good player but not even close to being a Celtic player at the moment. But there’s no doubt that he has the capability to be in the future.’
