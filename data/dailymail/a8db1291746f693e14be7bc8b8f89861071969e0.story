St Helens want to let the RFL deal with disgraced Wigan prop Ben Flower after he punched Lance Hohaia in Saturday’s Grand Final and are unlikely to call for a criminal investigation.

Flower was sent off for landing two blows on Hohaia, the second while his opponent lay motionless on the ground at Old Trafford.

The 26-year-old has been charged with a Grade F offence, the most serious in the RFL’s disciplinary code, and will appear before a three-man panel on Tuesday.

Grade A Offence - Fine/less than one week

Grade B Offence - One-two weeks

Grace C Offence - Two-three weeks

Grade D Offence - Three-five weeks

Grade E Offence - Four-eight weeks

Grade F Offence - Eight weeks plus, or a specified period of suspension 

Flower, who has apologised for the incident, faces a minimum eight-match ban but there are calls for a longer suspension.

Saints also have the option of pursuing their own action and held talks with Greater Manchester Police on Monday. However, it is understood the Grand Final winners are reluctant to do so if they are satisfied with the RFL punishment.

Saints chief executive Mike Rush said: ‘We’ll wait for the league to take the appropriate steps before passing comment and will then consider our position.’

There are concerns within the game that involving the police would set a dangerous precedent. Former Wales dual-code international Jonathan Davies said: ‘It opens up a can of worms if the police get involved because then you could have cases like this in any sport, from any age.’

Hohaia has been charged with a Grade B offence for allegedly striking Flower in the face with his forearm, which carries a ban of one to two games.
