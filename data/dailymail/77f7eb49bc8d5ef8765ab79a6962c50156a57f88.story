Amy Robach considers her job as news anchor on Good Morning America a much-needed distraction from her chemotherapy treatments, sources have said.

The 41-year-old, who has just taken over the anchor role following the prompt departure of Josh Elliott last week, has just completed the sixth of eight treatments to battle breast cancer.

She underwent the treatment last week and was back at work the next day.

'Amy considers getting up every morning 
and having something to look forward to a gift,' a source told People magazine. 'It's a much needed 
distraction from her treatment.'

Robach, a mother to two young girls and a step-mother to three boys, was diagnosed with breast cancer five months ago after undergoing a mammogram for the show.

She discovered she had a
 malignant tumor in her right breast and it was only after she had a double mastectomy soon after that 
doctors realized there was a second tumor in the same breast and some 
abnormal cells in the left breast.

After
 the surgery it also became clear that the disease had spread to her 
sentinel lymph nodes, meaning that the mastectomy was far from the final
 step.

Shock: She was diagnosed with cancer after undergoing an on-air mammogram last October

But amid the treatments, she has stayed positive by focusing on her work.

'Feeling like I have a purpose is very 
helpful,' she told the magazine.

'Mentally I feel stronger, knowing I'm still me. I 
still have my job. My life isn't just cancer, so it's very important for
 me to try and get my butt up.'

She returned to the air in December and after cutting her hair short on air, she went to Sochi to cover the Olympics while also undergoing chemo.

She told the magazine that she takes naps to keep up but that it can sometimes takes several days 'to get my mojo back'.

Preparation: She was filmed chopping off her locks as she started undergoing chemotherapy

Strong: Robach, showing off her new hair, has barely missed a day from work, sources have said

Her final chemo treatment is planned for April 24 and she will have breast reconstruction later this spring.

Due to the location and size of the tumors, Robach's surgeons were able to save her nipples and insert expanders that are placed where the removed breasts once were.

They will stay in place behind the chest muscle for a few months in an effort to stretch it out before implants are put in during a second surgery.
