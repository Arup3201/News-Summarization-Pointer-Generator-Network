Three men were arrested after their hot tub threesome turned violent during an argument over who gets paid more for escorting.

Austin Adams, 18, and Michael Gordon, 33, met 21-year-old Douglas Tench at a gay club in Spartanburg, South Carolina, on Saturday night before inviting him to the home where Gordon was dog-sitting.

The trio were 'kissing and touching each other' in the hot tub at 1.30am when Tench stated he earned more from escort services than Adams - prompting Adams to lash out.

Police arrested and ticketed Adams for common assault after he admitted he 'lost control'.

According to the police report, which consistently refers to the hot tub as a 'hot tube', the three men had been drinking at the bar before Tench was invited to join Gordon and Adams.

Gordon and Tench were both ticketed for giving alcohol to a minor.

They were all taken to the county jail and booked.
