Vice President Joe Biden's son, Beau, has returned home with his father and other family members after undergoing a complicated brain biopsy procedure at a Houston cancer center.

A small motorcade arrived at Vice President Biden's home just before 4pm on Thursday, shortly after Air Force Two arrived at New Castle County airport from Texas.

Beau Biden, the Delaware attorney-general, tweeted: 'On our way home! Can't wait to get back. Thank you, Houston,' and uploaded a photo of him with his wife and parents.

Happy farewell: Beau Biden posted this picture of him standing with his wife, stepmother Jill and father Joe as he was about to leave the Houston hospital

Back home: Beau Biden, pictured with his father, Vice-President Biden earlier this week, has returned home from hospital

He also tweeted a photo of himself and his wife Hallie in Houston, saying: 'Touched by all your well wishes - thank you. Nice evening in Houston w/ Hallie; will share update when we have it.'

The 44-year-old was admitted to University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center for a brain biopsy earlier this week after becoming weak and disoriented during a vacation in Indiana.

'You can read from that that it's likely that there was a tumor or some kind of tissue left behind from this mass that was biopsied,' Dr Nancy Snyderman told NBC News.

She added that it can takes weeks for results of biopsies to arrive. 

The father-of-two's hospital stay came two weeks after emergency dispatchers received a call from the vice-president's home regarding a report of a possible stroke.

Mr Biden, who was staying at his father's Delaware home while his home is being renovated, suffered a minor stroke in 2010.

Vice President Biden and his wife Jill released a statement through the White House on Wednesday to say their son was returning to Delaware after 'a successful procedure'.

'He is in great shape and is going to 
be discharged tomorrow and heading home to Delaware,' they said in the 
statement, adding: 'He will follow up with his local physicians in the coming weeks.'

The
White House declined to answer questions about what procedure was 
performed, and whether it was diagnostic or therapeutic in nature.

Pattern: Beau Biden was taken ill last week. It has now been revealed that 911 was called to his house weeks prior

Mr Biden was initially admitted to Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago last week. He traveled the following 
day to the Philadelphia hospital where he had been treated after his 
stroke in 2010 to consult with his doctor. He spent last weekend at home
in Wilmington before going to Houston.

Delaware
Department of Justice spokesman Jason Miller said the attorney-general 
had spoken to his chief deputy on Wednesday afternoon and Thursday 
morning.

Mr
Miller declined to provide information about Mr Biden's health and said he
did not know when the attorney-general would return to work.

'He'll continue to be in regular touch with the office, as he has been this week,' Mr Miller said.

The White House announced yesterday that Vice-President Biden has canceled scheduled appearances in Rhode Island and Maine to be with his son and other family members.

Records from a county dispatch center log indicated 
that someone at the vice-president's home was reported to be possibly 
having a stroke and apparently not alert.

What's wrong? The Vice President's son had a stroke in 2010. The White House released a statement from Joe and Jill Biden Wednesday announcing Beau had undergone an unnamed procedure

Mr Biden then arrived on Monday in Houston for tests at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.

Emergency
responders were also called earlier this month to the home where he had
been staying, two weeks before he was taken to hospital during a family
vacation, authorities said on Wednesday.

Rickie Clark, a staff supervisor with the Cranston Heights Fire Co., confirmed on Wednesday that county dispatchers received a call for help from the vice-president's home. However, he refused to provide further details.

The dispatch log on the fire department's website showed two references to the vice-president's home on August 1, one at 9:25pm and another about a minute and a half later.

All clear: The Biden's motorcade was seen leaving the Houston hospital Thursday morning

Procedure: A police officer stands guard at an entrance to the renowned MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas where Beau Biden underwent testing and a procedure Tuesday

Both cite ‘Cva-Not Alert,’ indicating 
that a person was in distress and apparently not alert or responsive to 
his or her surroundings. Mr Clark said ‘Cva’ is shorthand for 
cerebrovascular accident, or stroke.

Mr Biden was initially admitted to 
Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago last week and traveled the 
next day to the Philadelphia hospital where he had been treated for his 
2010 stroke to consult with his doctor. He spent last weekend at home in
Wilmington before going to Texas.

The younger Biden has posted two 
photos of himself in recent days - one of him smiling with his father on
Sunday, the other of him smiling with his wife, Hallie, on Tuesday.
