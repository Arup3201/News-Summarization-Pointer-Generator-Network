Former President George W. Bush said in a rare TV interview broadcast Sunday Morning that he was shocked to learn Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein expected him to back down from their 2003 standoff that preceded a massive U.S. invasion.

'You know, when he was captured, I was told that the FBI agent that talked to him – he said, "I just didn't believe Bush",' he told CBS newsman Bob Schieffer Sunday morning.

'And it's hard for me to believe he didn't believe me.'

'We'd given an ultimatum to the Taliban and delivered,' Bush said. 'I make the point in the book, of course, that -- and Dad understood this better than anybody -- that when you say something as president, you better mean it.'

That line is already being interpreted on Twitter and elsewhere as a veiled slap at President Barack Obama, whose 'red line' ultimatums leveled at Syria and Iran have been seen globally as tentative and toothless.

Former President George W. Bush appeared Sunday for a rare TV interview with CBS newsman Bob Schieffer on 'Face The Nation'

'I just didn't believe Bush,' Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein reportedly told American interrogators after his capture, a revelation that left Bush '43' surprised

'Words mean something. ... I thought I was pretty clear at times during my presidency and meant it,' Bush said Sunday. 'Saddam Hussein didn't believe us. So I was surprised.'

'It was hard in retrospect for me to look back and say, "I don't see how he could doubt my word".' 

The  interview aired on CBS during a day when the network was marking the 60th anniversary retrospective of the program 'Face the Nation.'

Bush's new book, '41: A Portrait of my Father,' will ship on Tuesday. It's a portrait of President George H.W. Bush, who served a single term in the White House before losing the job to Bill Clinton in 1992.

The younger Bush kept the book project close to his vest for years. The Associated Press reported Sunday that it includes a probing analysis of his father's decision to invade Iraq the first time around.

But he insists in the book that his 2003 Middle East battles with Saddam Hussein weren't son's homage to his dad.

'I was not trying "to finish what my father had begun," as some have suggested,' he writes. 

Bush Sr. had driven Iraqi forces loyal to Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait but allowed them a safe retreat to Baghdad. Bush Jr. swooped in to finish the job after al-Qaeda terrorists struck New York City and the Pentagon in 2001. 

'I went in there as a result of a very changed environment because of September the 11th. And the danger we were concerned about was that the weapons ... would be put into the hands of terrorist groups that would come and make the attacks of 9/11 pale in comparison.' 

He included an explanation in his book, Bush said Sunday, because he 'was just responding to, kind of, the gossip that tends to work around the political circles – that "clearly he had only one thing in mind and that was to finish the job his father didn't," because my dad decided not to go into Baghdad after routing Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait.'

The younger Bush preceded Barack Obama in America's highest office, and saw his Pentagon's hard-fought gains in the region reversed by troop pullouts from both Afghanistan and Iraq. He said Sunday that he has no regrets about sending American servicemen and women into a brutally fought and protracted war.

'I think it was the right decision,' he told Schieffer.

Obama's troop withdrawals at the end of 2011 have been blamed widely for the rise of ISIS, the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, which swarmed into the spaces left by America's departure.

Bush appeared Sunday in a rare TV interview, discussing Iraq policy, his new biography of his father, and the chances his younger brother Jeb might make a White House run of his own

'MISSION ACCOMPLISHED': President George W. Bush addressed the nation aboard the nuclear aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln in May 2003 after what he called a 'victory in a war on terror' after Saddam Hussein's ouster – but Obama would later roll back those gains by withdrawing all US troops from Iraq

ISIS now controls nearly two-thirds of both Iraq and Syria, by some estimates. Bush suggested Sunday that it didn't have to be that way.

'My regret is that a violent group of people have risen up again,' the former president said.

'This is "al Qaeda-plus." I put it in the book, they need to be defeated. And I hope we do. I hope that the strategy works.'

Bush also commented on talk of his younger brother Jeb, a former Florida governor, making a run for the presidency in what would be a precedent-setting three-peat for the bush family if he were successful. 

Jeb is 'wrestling with the decision,' he said. 'I think it's 50-50.' 

'He and I are very close,' offered the former president. 'On the other hand, he's not here knocking on my door, you know, agonizing about the decision. He knows exactly, you know, the ramifications on family, for example. He's seen his dad and his brother go through the presidency. I'd give it a tossup.'

He said he would be 'all in' to support his brother if he runs, and would accept a behind-the-scenes role if that's what was asked of him.

Former first lady Barbara Bush has gone on record saying that enough Bushes have already run for president.

'Sometimes her prognostications haven't been very accurate,' George W. said.

That line was a veiled slam on President Barack Obama, whom he also slapped over the rise of ISIS in Iraq where the U.S. military once dominated
