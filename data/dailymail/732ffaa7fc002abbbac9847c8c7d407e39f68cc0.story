Whether you kick back with a glass of wine, immerse yourself in a novel or strike up a conversation with the person seated next to you on a plane can be determined by which nationality is listed on your passport, a survey has claimed.

According to the results of an international passenger investigation, Australians are the biggest boozers on board with 36 per cent choosing to down the hatch, compared to 35 per cent of Americans and 33 per cent of Brits.

The Airline Passenger Experience Association (APEX) spoke to around 1,500 people, ages 18 and older, who have travelled by plane at least once during the last three months and were living in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, China, Singapore, Australia or Brazil.

The results found Chinese travellers are most likely to nod off once the seatbelt sign switches off. They are also the first to reach for their credit card for some in-flight shopping and the biggest fans of gaming. 

• Thirty-eight percent of respondents listed comfortable seating as the top priority for improvements

• Twenty-nine percent of male respondents said they want quieter cabins

• Twenty-six percent of women respondents prioritised upgraded lavatories

• Women are 30 percent more likely than men to pay to check extra bags, even if overhead luggage space is no concern

• Sixty-two percent of passengers bought food prior to boarding, even if 70 percent are satisfied with in-flight food

• Being on time is the biggest concern for passengers on the ground prior to the flight, followed by seat selection and legroom

• Passengers under 34 are the most active in social connectivity, but travellers between 35 and 54 also are highly active online – with 43 percent who said they engaged in in-flight social connectivity at least once in a three-month span of flying

 

Americans on the other hand like to use their time in the air more productively – when not drinking - opting to work while flying at 35,000 feet.

Meanwhile, Brits and Germans are the best at making chit chat with random strangers – spending 50 per cent more time than any other nationalities schmoozing.

Contrastingly, Brazilians conduct their conversations online via email, messaging apps or social media.

Despite plane food having a bad reputation, seven out of 10 respondents said they were happy to chow down on the selection of in-flight snacks and meals.

In-flight magazines were also popular with four out of five passengers claiming to read them.

The international flyers, who travelled on eight major airlines, did however express their desire for better in-flight entertainment and 36 per cent wanted improved connectivity.

‘The industry has greatly improved the comfort, ambience, connectivity and entertainment onboard aircraft, and this data underscores that passengers are embracing those improvements,’ said Russell Lemieux, APEX executive director.

‘At the same time, passengers are demanding more from their air travel experiences which will drive more innovations touching all aspects of the journey,’ he added.
