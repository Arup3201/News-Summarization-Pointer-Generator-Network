A century-old time capsule celebrating New York life in 1914 has been unsealed - 40 years later than its creators hoped it would be.

The bronze box, filled mostly with documents from long-gone Wall Street businessmen, was meant to have been opened in 1974 but it lay forgotten.

Workers wearing surgical gloves removed the 26 screws that had kept the box sealed shut for 100 years in front of spectators at the New-York Historical Society.

The items uncovered included a collection of documents, booklets and newspapers depicting the  businessmen's interests - from the tea, coffee and spice trade to other commerce, baseball and bullfights.

'This is the thrill of recovering relics,' said Nick Yablon, a professor of American studies at the University of Iowa who is writing a book about time capsules.

The Lower Wall Street Business Men's Association deposited the box with the historical society after celebrating the tricentennial of the 1614 charter of the New Netherland Company - one of the colony's pioneering commercial enterprises and a precursor of New York business. 

The association asked that the time capsule be unsealed in 1974.

But that did not happen because the time capsule was forgotten.

A curator discovered it in the society's warehouse in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood.

Among the books, documents and newspapers sat a photograph of Ellen Jay, a direct descendant of John Jay - the American statesman and diplomat widely considered to be one of the founding fathers of the United States. 

The box containing the well-preserved papers included another interesting item: a facsimile of a 1774, pre-American Revolutionary War letter written by the colony, now New York, to British colonized Boston, urging that the colonies unite.

Fast forward to May 23, 1914, the date of a telegram in the box from then New York Gov. Martin Glynn wishing the New York of 1974 well.

As it turned out, in 1974, the city was battling a fiscal crisis. And The Lower Wall Street Business Men's Association no longer existed. 

A new time capsule was created by high school students from the society's internship program, selecting items to be unsealed in 2114, including tickets to a Lady Gaga concert.

Contributions also include Purell hand sanitizer and an iconic, Greek-style New York paper coffee cup.

'I stole it,' confessed the giggling 17-year-old.
