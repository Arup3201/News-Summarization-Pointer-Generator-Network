From bizarre 'nerve nutrients' to strange contraptions that shot live electric currents through the body, the means used to treat mental illness weren't always the most pleasant.

Now a new exhibition promises to reveal how doctors made the leap from tinctures crammed with phosphates to modern medicine over just 250 years.

The exhibition, entitled Mind Maps: Stories from Psychology, also includes a section that focuses on the birth of radar, the driver for a number of breakthroughs in the early 20th century, and looks at the Victorian obsession with 'melancholia'.

Painful: This electroconvulsive therapy machine was made in the 1940s for the Burden Neurological Institute

Other fascinating exhibits include a series of vintage nerve tonics, among them one named Huxley's Ner-Vigor, which claimed to strengthen the nerves, and the 'frog pistol', a bizarre contraption invented by German scientist Emil du Boise-Reymond to show the effect electricity had on dismembered frog's legs.

The Science Museum, which is hosting the free exhibition, also included a grim-looking Ediswan electroconvulsive therapy machine, which was widely used between 1944 and 1960, in the display.

Yet more objects show how early scientists attempted to understand the mind, frequently with the help of some very strange contraptions.

Particularly odd is Fechner's double sound pendulum, which was invented by German scientists in 1898 and used by early psychologists to 'listen' to the thoughts of their patients.

Fortifying: Sedating tonics such as Ner-Vigor and Spasmodene were thought to boost the nervous system

Bizarre: Fechner's double sound pendulum was thought to be able to pick up people's thoughts

Clever: The Frog Pistol, was devised by scientists to demonstrate the stimulation of nerves in a frog's leg

Equally strange is the chronoscope, an English invention used to measure the speed of thought with varying levels of success.

Speaking about the exhibition, curator Phil Loring said: 'The quest to uncover the mysteries of the mind has
 pre-occupied scientists for centuries and continues to do so in 2013 â€“ 
where mental wellbeing remains a pressing topic in society.

'This 
exhibition looks at how far weâ€™ve progressed in our understanding of the
 mind and how treatments for mental health conditions have evolved over 
the past three centuries.'

Dr Richard Mallows, president of the British Psychological Society which is supporting the exhibition, added: 'I am delighted that the Society has had
 the opportunity to work with the world renowned Science Museum to 
support the development of this exhibition.

'It will be an excellent 
opportunity for a wide-ranging audience to get an insight into 
psychology and our fascination with the mind.'
