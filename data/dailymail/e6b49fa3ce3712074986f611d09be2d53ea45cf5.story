A French plan to 'commercialise' the D-Day commemorations by turning them into massive profits has been scrapped following angry protests.

Broadcasters France Television and TF1 wanted to cash in on their exclusive live rights by charging media organisations hundreds of thousands of pounds to stream the footage live.

This could have led to millions around the world, including veterans, missing out on coverage of the 70th anniversary of the Second World War invasion.

Four agencies, including the Associated Press and France's AFP, which led the protests said they alone would have ended up with a combined bill equivalent to around £160,000

Philippe Massonnet, of AFP, said: 'The commercialisation of this historic event is shocking.'

But French President Francois Hollande has now backed down, insisting that everybody can have the images at zero cost.

A joint statement by France Television, which is public, and TF1, which is private, reads: 'For all foreign channels and agencies, given the exceptional nature of the event and at the request of the Presidency of the Republic, pictures will be available for free.'

Heads of state including the Queen and U.S. President Barack Obama will be among those attending the D-Day commemorations in Normandy on Friday, along with around 1800 veterans who were involved in the June 6th 1944 landings.

The Queen was due to arrive in Paris this afternoon for a three day state visit to France, and will travel to Normandy for the day tomorrow.
