More than half of voters think the Lib Dems are irrelevant, as latest polls show barely three per cent of people will definitely vote for Nick Clegg at the next election.

The Lib Dem leader issued a rallying cry to activists today, warning they have the 'fight of our lives' ahead to prevent wipeout in May 2015.

One former minister, Jeremy Browne, branded the Lib Dems the political equivalent of struggling supermarket chain Morrisons.

But in the conference hall in Glasgow delegates appeared to be looking for divine intervention, pictured apparently praying in the auditorium.

Pollsters ComRes  found 56 per cent of people think the Lib Dems have become irrelevant, while just 26 per cent disagree, in a survey for ITV News

A new ComRes poll for ITV News found 56 per cent of people think the Lib Dems have become irrelevant, while just 26 per cent disagree.

Just 14 per cent trust Mr Clegg to keep the promises he makes while 63 per cent believe the Lib Dem leader will break his pledges.

Some 44 per cent of adults believe it was a mistake for the party to go into Coalition with the Conservatives in 2010 and 42 per cent feel betrayed by Nick Clegg.

But ousting the Deputy Prime Minister and replacing him with a new leader would mean just 18 per cent are more likely to vote for the Liberal Democrats.

More voters, however, still give the Liberal Democrats credit for raising of the personal tax allowance to £10,000 at 30 per cent compared to 22 per cent for the Conservatives.

In a separate poll by Lord Ashcroft, just 7 per cent of people say they plan to vote Lib Dem next year,

Of those, just a third - or 2.2 per cent of all voters - say they will definitely vote for Mr Clegg's party.

Overall, the Tories are ahead on 32 per cent - after their successful conference last week - with Labour on 30 per cent.

UKIP are on 17 per cent, with the Greens on 7 per cent - the same as the Lib Dems.

The ComRes poll also revealed that just a third of the public think it was not a mistake for the Lib Dems to enter into Coalition with the Tories

The public still distrust the Deputy Prime Minister over his broken election promise not to increase student fees

The Lib Dems are languishing in fourth place in the polls - equal with the Greens, but behind UKP

Today Mr Clegg played down his party's struggles in the polls. He told ITV's Good Morning Britain: '

'I've literally lost count of the times, with the greatest respect, that I've been asked questions saying 'oh isn't it going to be a disaster? Aren't you going to be wiped out? Isn't it all going to be terrible?' And every time we confound the sceptics and I genuinely think we will do so next year.

'Not because I'm being somehow naïve about this – of course this has been tough for us over the last few years.

'But because I experience this in my own constituency in south-west Sheffield – and speaking to my friends and colleagues here, we all experience the same – when we get out and tell our side of the story and say that it's because of us the economy is now growing again.

'It's because of us people have got more money in their pockets because we've given fair tax cuts to people on low and middle incomes, it's because of us there are more apprenticeships than ever before, it's because of us the state pension has gone up by the largest cash terms ever, and so on and so forth – the more we explain our side of the story and what we've done in government, the more we do get people to support us in those areas where we are competing for those votes. And that's what we need to do between now and the next general election.

'I'm not a soothsayer or a pollster so you'll need to speak pollsters and soothsayers about what they think the future will hold. All I can tell you is what I believe, what our values are and the pride that I have in what we've done over the last four and a half years.'

However, Mr Clegg's main conference slogan has been ridiculed by former Lib Dem minister Jeremy Browne.

He branded the party the political equivalent of struggling supermarket chain Morrisons.

Mr Browne said the party's positioning showed a 'fundamental misunderstanding' of the current political reality and mocked the Lib Dems' 'stronger economy, fairer society' conference slogan, repeatedly used by Mr Clegg in broadcast interviews.

Voters will not be won over by a party that makes reining in others and banning things its main pitch, he told the ResPublica conference fringe.

He said: 'Our slogan really is stronger economy, invisible brackets, than you would get if Labour was in government on their own, close invisible brackets. Fairer society, open invisible brackets, than you would get if the Conservatives were in government on their own, close brackets.'

'So, the very slogan of our conference is about how we would aspire to mitigate others in government, that our raison d'etre in politics is not to advance our our ideas but to retard the advancement of other people's ideas and that we will, quotes, anchor them in the centre ground, i.e., make sure people who believe something can't put actually put their beliefs forward unimpeded.

'It feels to me like we are pursuing a second vote strategy in a one preference voting system.'

He added: 'I think we need a message, I don't just mean in this election but for the next 10 years, about what we believe in, what do we stand for as a party.'

While UKIP and the SNP are like Aldi and Lidl, the Lib Dems are like Morrisons, he said.

'The Lib Dems are the Morrisons of our day. We have to think what are we offering the customers that goes beyond those who shop at Morrisons out of habit or because it is the nearest to their home.'

'At the moment we are heavily reliant on habit and geographic proximity.'
