Legal battle: Debra Mandelbaum (pictured) is in the midst of a bitter divorce from husband Michael, who says the two were never married to begin with 

The multi-milionaire son of a Minnesota Vikings owner is trying to get out of a costly divorce by arguing that he was never married to his wife of 20 years to begin with. 

Michael and Debra Mandelbaum separated late last year, after he allegedly pushed her down a flight of stairs during a fight at their Warren, New Jersey home.  

The couple are currently in the middle of a protracted divorce, thanks to a technicality in their 1993 wedding ceremony. 

The Mandelbaums applied for a marriage license on December 10, 1993, and were married two days later in a Jewish ceremony. But the marriage license wasn't actually issued until December 21. 

Though they lived together as husband and wife for more than two decades, and share three children, Mr Mandelbaum says he was never legally married and therefore exempt from divorce and the traditional dividing of property.

Mr Mandelbaum filed a motion to dismiss the divorce in May. The case has continued after his estranged wife submitted evidence to the court of their relationship. 

Among the documents are joint tax returns, deeds and anniversary cards where Mr Mandelbaum wrote 'For my wife' and 'after 20 years, I'd marry you all over again'. 

The couple are due back in court early next month. 

At stake is the Mandelbaum's estimated $2million six-bedroom home in Warren. 

50/50 split? The couple shared this estimated $2million home in Warren, NJ prior to their break-up. Last December, police were called to the house where they found Mrs Mandelbaum half-conscious at the bottom of the stairs 

In a strange tie to the current NFL scandal involving Ray Rice, Mr Mandelbaum was accepted into the same pretrial intervention program for hitting his wife last year. 

Candidates accepted into the program can have the charges dropped if they successfully complete the course.

Rice went through the program, which many considered too light a sentence after video was released, showing him punching then-fiancée Janay Palmer. 

Mandelbaum's wife obtained a temporary restraining order against her husband after he pushed her down a set of stairs at their house last December. 

Police responding to the scene found Mrs Mandelbaum half-conscious at the bottom of the stairs. 

Mr Mandelbaum was charged with aggravated assault in the third degree before being accepted into the intervention program.  

Mr Mandelbaum is the son of David Mandelbaum, one of the wealthiest people in America. According to Forbes, David Mandelbaum and his family made $900million last year. 

In addition to a minority ownership in the Minnesota Vikings, David Mandelbaum has stakes in Vornado Realty Trust. 

His son Michael 'handles the legal affairs of the family'.
