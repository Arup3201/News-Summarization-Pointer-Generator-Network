Nick Clegg is sending his eldest son to one of the most over-subscribed state Catholic schools in Britain – the same choice made by Tony Blair for his children.

The Deputy Prime Minister’s son, Antonio, will attend the London Oratory School from this autumn.

Mr Clegg, who is an atheist, and his wife Miriam chose the elite institution, which is just over two miles from their £1.6million Putney home, ahead of closer state schools – including two ranked as ‘outstanding’ by schools watchdog Ofsted.

They had also considered the Lib Dem leader’s alma mater, the £23,000-a-year Westminster School, but plumped for the state-funded school instead.

Miriam Clegg is Spanish and Catholic and the couple’s three children are being raised in the faith. 

A spokesman for Mr Clegg said he and his wife were ‘delighted’ to get their son into the school. His decision to send his son to a state school comes after he was criticised for even considering educating his eldest child privately.

And he will open himself up to accusations of hypocrisy after the Lib Dems, in their 2010 general election manifesto, pledged to stamp out ‘discrimination’ in faith schools on grounds of belief.

Mr Clegg’s aides said the family felt ‘lucky’ to get in.

When he first became party leader, Mr Clegg was asked if he believed in God. He replied simply: ‘No.’

Later he said he had ‘enormous respect’ for people with faith and added: ‘I’m married to a Catholic and am committed to bringing my children up as Catholics.’

Under the school’s strict criteria, at least one parent has to be a practising Catholic before a child can be admitted and the pupil is expected to show involvement in the church.

Mr Clegg’s spokesman said: ‘Nick married in a Catholic church, his children are Catholics but he has never pretended he is anything other than an atheist.’

According to the London Oratory’s website, there were more than 800 applications for the 2013 intake, and only 160 places allocated.

Siblings of existing pupils have a higher chance of getting in to the Oratory, which is good news for the Cleggs as they have two younger sons, Alberto, seven, and four-year-old Miguel.

The Blairs sent their sons, Euan and Nicky, to the school. Their daughter Kathryn is believed to have joined in the sixth form.

Last year, 97 per cent of sixth-formers gained three or more A-levels at grades A -E. In its last Ofsted report, in 2009, the school was judged to be outstanding.

The Clegg family's choice of education will make fewer headlines than if they had opted for a private school, but is not without controversy.

Former prime minister Tony Blair attracted some criticism when he sent his two eldest sons, Nicky and Euan, to the top-rated state school, while daughter Kathryn is believed to have joined in the sixth form.

The school, which caters only for boys only up to age 16, is extremely popular, and achieves good exam results.

Last year, 92 per cent of pupils scored at least five GCSEs at grade C or above, including English and maths, while 97 per cent of sixth-formers gained three or more A-levels at grades A*-E.

In its last Ofsted report, in 2009, the school, which became an academy in 2011, was judged to be outstanding overall.

London Oratory is part of the Catholic Church, and has strict criteria for pupils to meet when the school is over-subscribed.

Priority admission to youngsters who practise the faith, with the school looking firstly at how often the child and his parents attend mass, followed by whether the child fulfils the Church's requirements on baptism, whether they have received their first Holy Communion, and whether the child or a Catholic parent has served in any Catholic Parish or the wider Church.

A spokesman for Mr Clegg said: 'In response to media inquiries, Nick and Miriam can confirm that they have decided to send their oldest son, Antonio, from September onwards to the London Oratory School, a state Catholic secondary school.

'He is currently a pupil at a state Catholic primary school, Our Lady of the Victories in Putney, where he has been going for the last six years.

'Now that their decision has been made public, they hope that the privacy of their son will be respected.'

However, it could prove controversial that the couple have secured a place at one of the most exclusive schools in the capital.

Mr Clegg had previously hinted that the couple would choose a private school for their son.

‘If it works out to send them to a good state (school) we will do so but, like all parents sending their children to secondary school in London, as you know there is huge competition for places,' he said last month.

The Deputy Prime Minister said he would put his children’s education first and would not overrule the wishes of his wife or son for ‘political reasons’.

It is thought the couple looked around several schools, including The London Oratory and a £30,000-a-year independent school.

Education Secretary Michael Gove defended Mr Clegg, and insisted politicians had to do the right thing for their children.

He said: ‘Nick Clegg should send his son to the right school for his son. I would absolutely defend him whatever he chose to do. A parent's first responsibility is to their child.

David Cameron has insisted he is ‘committed’ to sending his eldest daughter Nancy to a state school, as in London ‘there’s a real improvement taking place’.

When it emerged in 2010 that the couple were interested in The London Oratory, the headmaster McFadden, said his school would be a 'natural choice' for the couple, who were 'happy with what they saw'.

The Liberal Democrat leader previously insisted it was not 'entirely surprising' that the family was looking at good state Catholic schools.

Critics have suggested that other suitable schools are closer.

The spokesman said Mr and Mrs Clegg had looked at options but it was a 'very common' choice to attend the Oratory from Antonio's current primary school.

'The reason why they are sending him to the Oratory is quite simple - they think it is the best school for him,' he added..
