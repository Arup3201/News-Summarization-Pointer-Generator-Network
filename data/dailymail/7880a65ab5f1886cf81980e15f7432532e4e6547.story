It may not be what his successor Joe Hockey wants to hear but former Treasurer Peter Costello thinks tough times might not be far away for the lucky country.  

He believes that Australia’s 'luck is beginning to run out'.

The nation's longest serving treasurer was speaking at a property forum, where he also told delegates anyone thinking the cost of housing in Australia was expensive, was wrong.

'Australia's luck is beginning to run out' says former Treasurer Peter Costello

Mr Costello defended his view that the country's luck is beginning to run out because wages are on the decline  and consumer pessimism grows.

He claimed that while Australia is 'far' from recession, the economy was undergoing big changes, leaving people with a sense of uncertainty about the future.

'For the first time since the 1990s, per capita incomes have stabilised in Australia - they are no longer growing,' Mr Costello added.

Consumers were 'anxious' and have 'stopped spending'.

'Young people under 50 who have lived through a period of uninterrupted rising incomes are beginning to experience something that's different.'

Consumers were 'anxious' and had 'stopped spending'.

Real wages were falling and disposable incomes had 'peaked'.

The former Liberal treasurer also pointed out that the household savings ratio was now 10 per cent, compared with the booming 1990s when people were spending all of their wealth.

'People have closed the credit card and opened a bank account,' he said.

Mr Costello then turned his attention to the future of manufacturing in Australia. He insists there is still hope for the industry but it would no longer be a 'mass employer' of local workers.

In comments which will have cheered Joe Hockey, Mr Costello seemed to back his optimism for the future of the property market, who on Tuesday rejected as 'lazy analysis' claims it was in a bubble and risked crashing.

Mr Costello suggested Australia's strong population growth would likely continue to support the property market.

He also insisted that housing was 'not expensive' in Australia, compared with overseas markets despite the report by the Bank for International Settlements suggesting quite the opposite. It found that Australia was in fact second only to Norway as the most expensive market in the world.

'Building a house is comparatively cheap,' Mr Costello argued.

'What is expensive in Australia is land. So we have an increasing demand but we have quite a restrictive supply of land.

As a result, prices are high.'

A top seller on the Australian property market recently was this $4.5 million four-bedroom home at Burwood in Sydney's inner west

He blamed that on state taxes imposed on the release and transfer of land.

83 per cent of homes listed for option in Sydney on the first weekend of Spring were sold, including a $4.5 million sale at Burwood in the inner west and 80 per cent of those under the hammer were sold in Melbourne. Brisbane, Adelaide, Canberra and Perth also had increased clearance rates

Mr Costello said sooner or later world economies would normalise, with the US winding back its money printing stimulatory measures and interest rates rising again.

'It could still be a good time for property if things revert to normal ... (but) there could be a fair bit of hardship that we have to go through and readjustment,' he said.
