Tragedy: Loved teacher Frankie Cappuccini died after giving birth to a baby son on Tuesday

A primary school teacher has died in hospital after giving birth by Caesarean section to her second son.

Frankie Cappuccini – affectionately nicknamed Mrs Coffee by her pupils – suffered heavy bleeding after her baby was born on Tuesday.

Although she found the strength to spend a few hours nursing her son, Jack, she died of a cardiac arrest in Pembury Hospital, in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, soon after.

Jack, who weighed 7lb 15oz when he was born, is said to be doing well and has been given the middle name Frankie after his mother.

Mrs Cappuccini, 30, leaves her husband Tom, 32, their three-year-old son, Luca, and Jack.

Mr Cappuccini wrote to well-wishers on his wife’s Facebook page: ‘Thank you all for your thoughts and prayers.

‘I love you so much Frankie. RIP. Your husband. Tom xxxx.’

Staff at Offham Primary School, near West Malling, Kent, were described as ‘shell shocked’ and decided to close the school on Wednesday to help children come to terms with Mrs Cappuccini’s death.

Parents of the school’s 200 pupils received an email explaining what had happened to the Year One teacher, whose pupils were aged between five and six.

Head teacher Phillip Hunter said: ‘Frankie did her teacher training with us nine years ago and stayed on afterwards.

‘She was a bubbly, enthusiastic and positive person and on top of all a brilliant teacher. She was a friend and a colleague to us.

Moving: A book of condolence opened in her memory shows the depth of feeling felt by her pupils towards her

Message: Flowers left in the local church show how keenly the community has felt her death

Shut: The small Offham primary is closed today because of Frankie's death

‘The community is shattered to learn 
of her death and the school was closed on Wednesday as our community 
came to terms with the news.’

 Mr Hunter said Kent County Council’s 
education psychology team had visited the school when it was closed to 
advise teachers on bereavement support.

The school is planning a memorial service for Mrs Cappuccini in the near future.

A book of condolence was opened at 
nearby St Michael’s Church and tearful villagers left flowers and 
personal messages throughout the day.

Parent Paula Botha, whose son Troy was
taught by Mrs Cappuccini, said: ‘It is such a tragedy for this to 
happen, and to such a wonderful person just makes it feel so much more 
of a tragedy.

‘She was an amazing teacher and an 
amazing individual and we are all going to miss her very much – her 
family, the schoolchildren, fellow teachers, parents and friends.’ One 
friend and former work colleague said: ‘She was the most wonderful 
person and teacher – beautiful inside and out.

Tributes: Flowers have been left near the altar all with moving messages to the primary school teacher

‘I can’t express enough how selfless, 
thoughtful and kind Frankie was, what an amazing teacher she was and how
much of a loss this is.’

Offham Primary School has now reopened
and a note asks for flowers to be taken to St Michael’s Church rather 
than being left at the gates.

Kent County Council area education officer David Adams said: ‘Frances was a much-loved teacher and will be greatly missed.

‘Our thoughts are with her family, friends and the school community.’

A statement on the school’s website 
said: ‘Our thoughts are with her family at this time.’  The number of 
Caesarean sections has doubled in Britain since 1990 and they now 
account for a quarter of all births.

That figure compares with the 1950s, when only around 3 per cent of babies were delivered by Caesarean sections.

The NHS relaxed its guidelines last year making it easier for more mothers to have babies by C-section.

But new statistics show that one in ten women develop infections after undergoing the procedure.

The number of women dying in childbirth is up - mainly because of rising numbers of older new mums, expert research has found.

A study into this issue by the Lancet this year showed that in London alone it has doubled in five years - twice the level found in the rest of the UK.

Doctors say this is caused by more women being obese, older and also growing numbers using fertility treatment to get pregnant.

Junior doctors have also been blamed for not knowing the limit of their experience and also senior medics have not been supervising them properly, a separate study said.

Prof Cathy Warwick, general secretary of the Royal College of Midwives, told the Telegraph: 'Across the country, two factors are combining: maternity services are under pressure from a steadily rising birth rate while dealing with far more women with complex pregnancies.'

She said trends in London were mirrored elsewhere in Britain, particularly in urban areas.

The Lancet said maternal deaths in the capital rose from fewer than 10 deaths per 100,000 maternities in 2005/2006 to 20 deaths per 100,000 in 2010/2011.

The average in the UK outside London of 8.6 fatalities per 100,000 births.

There were 31  London deaths in total 10-11, with the total reducing to 22 in 11-12.
