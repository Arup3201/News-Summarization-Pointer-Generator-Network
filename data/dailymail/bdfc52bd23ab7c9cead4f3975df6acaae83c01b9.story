The family of a murdered 27-year-old Georgia student listened to her killer’s confession in which he revealed the moment she ripped off the mask he was wearing and recoiled in horror as she recognized her friend before he strangled her to death.

Mercer University School of Law graduate Stephen McDaniel, 28, pleaded guilty to the June 2011 murder of fellow student Lauren Giddings, 27, in court on Monday and provided a full confession as part of his deal.

McDaniel's coolly detailed confession of how he startled Lauren awake at 4.30am on Sunday June 26 after he broke into her apartment dressed all in black was paraphrased in part to the court according to the Macon Telegraph.

Confession: Lauren Giddings (left) was strangled to death by her friend and next-door neighbor and classmate Stephen McDaniel (seen right in 2011) - who pleaded guilty to the crime in court on Monday in Georgia

Charged: Stephen McDaniel stands before the magistrate at the Bibb County Law Enforcement Center surrounded by Bibb County Bailiffs, his attorney, Macon Police Detective Carl Flecther and District Attorney Greg Winters in June 2011

'She saw me and said, very calmly, 'Get the f*** out,' said McDaniel in his confession which outlined how he killed and dismembered Lauren before disposing her remains in a trash dumpster outside the apartment complex they both lived in.

'I leaped across the bed onto her and grabbed her around the throat. We tumbled out of the bed to the floor and in her struggle to get away, she moved her legs and her lower body under her bed, preventing her from getting away or kicking me,' he wrote according to the Macon Telegraph.

During their struggle, Lauren managed to rip the mask from McDaniel's face and pleaded,  'Stephen? Please stop'.

McDaniel clenched his hands around her throat for 15 minutes until she stopped moving and then 'dragged her into the bathroom and placed her in the bathtub.'

According to this confession he then returned to his apartment next door to Lauren's and spent the entire day on his computer according to the Macon Telegraph.

Then, in the evening, he returned with a hacksaw and cut up her body.

'I removed her limbs and head, wrapped them in several black trash bags, separately, and discarded them in the Mercer law school dumpster,' he wrote.

The cool killer then said that he put Lauren's torso into the apartment trash can on June 28 - two days before it was found.

At the allocution on Monday at Bibb County Superior Court, the Chief Medical Examiner confirmed there was no sign of sexual assault on the corpse.

McDaniel has denied raping Lauren.

'She was wearing the pink running shorts when she died and I never removed them,' he wrote. 'They were found on her torso just as I had left them.'

Before McDaniels changed his plea, the court had heard how he had spied on Lauren for months, using a camera attached to a 6-foot-long wooden stick - standing beneath her second-floor apartment and videoing her.

Prosecutors said Stephen Mark McDaniel faces life in prison for killing 27-year-old Lauren Giddings in Macon in central Georgia in June 2011, the same year that both graduated from the Mercer University School of Law in the city

He had become obsessed with Lauren, his next-door neighbor at Barristers Hall apartments, across the street from Mercer University's law school - where they had been classmates.

The court heard he had become devastated that because they were both graduating he would never see her again.

In the days after the murder, McDaniel attended class and even joined a search party for Lauren with friends on the night of June 29.

He claimed he was 'in a dream-like delusional state' and had convinced himself that Lauren was still alive.

Lauren's father told the Macon Telegraph that he believes only one third of McDaniel's account.

'He’s
 had a long time to put it together. That’s about as good as he could 
get it, and that’s pretty horrible,' Billy Giddings, 58, said.

After
 the confession was read, Lauren's mother Karen, 53, said that her 
family are 'scarred forever by the sheer, exquisite pain of missing 
her.'

'We have lived going on three years now an unimaginable nightmare wondering what kind of horror our daughter endured,' she said.

The Giddings family requested that McDaniel not face the death penalty.

McDaniel was initially charged with breaking into two apartments in the building using a master key he somehow obtained, according to police. McDaniel and Giddings lived in neighboring apartments across the street from the law school

'We
 just don’t want him in our thoughts anymore. ... I hope he lives a long
 life in the worst possible way,' said Billy Giddings.

Karen Giddings said 'I really can't stand to look at him.'

During the course of his confession, McDaniel attempted to justify his murder.

He described himself as 'divided in mind, unable to account for how I could have committed these horrible acts and, at the same time, also be able to carry on daily routines.'

He went on, 'It’s difficult for me to explain why I killed Lauren and attempted to conceal my deed the way I did. ... I know that it was very wrong; I am not delusional or without all morals or decency.”

McDaniel said, 'Something in my makeup — my psychology, my neuropathy (sic), my own particular pathology, perhaps — must explain it.' He expressed remorse according to the Macon Telegraph, saying he grieves Giddings daily, but doesn’t expect forgiveness from her family.

'There is no way I can ever deserve it,” he said. 'If I could take back what happened, I would.'

It was the discovery of the video evidence on McDaniel's computer that caused the defense to seek a deal with the prosecution.

He will first be eligible to request parole in 2041, but District Attorney David Cooke said, 'I fully expect Stephen McDaniel will spend the rest of his life behind bars.'
