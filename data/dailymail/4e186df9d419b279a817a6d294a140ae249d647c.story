The head coach for South Korean’s Olympic sailing team has been sent home in disgrace after he was caught drink-driving.

Jae-Cheol Lee, 38, had spent Tuesday evening drinking wine at a welcome party in Weymouth, Dorset, which is hosting all sailing events for the games.

Following the function he carried on drinking with other sailing coaches before returning to South Korea’s accommodation at the Olympic Village on Portland at midnight.

At 5am he climbed into his MG6 coupe and was spotted by police veering across the road close to the Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy.

A breath test showed he was more than twice the drink drive limit and Lee was fined and banned from driving for 18 months by magistrates in Weymouth. 

Hours later the South Korean Olympic delegation in London held an emergency disciplinary committee and decided to send the coach back to Seoul.

It was reported that the delegation believed Lee’s ‘reprehensible act’ would have had an adverse effect on the ‘honor and morale’ of the national team.

Not the best way to fly the South Korea flag: Lee was ordered to pay a fine and costs totalling £340 and was banned from driving in the UK for 18 months

Julian Lawrence, prosecuting, told magistrates that Lee’s manner of driving had aroused interest in the police.

He said: 'Though it was still dark the car’s headlights were not on and as police followed it they saw the vehicle was veering towards the road’s central white line.

'That gave them cause for concern.'

He said Lee had been on his own in the car and appeared unsteady on his feet when he got out of the vehicle.

Olympic sailing explained: The events start on July 29 and carry on until August 11

Simon Lacey, defending, told the court: 'Lee had been to a welcome party where he had a few glasses of wine and then, with other coaches he’d met there, had gone for further drinks.

'Around midnight Lee had gone to accommodation the team had in Weymouth and stayed there until he felt it was safe to drive.

'The South Korean Olympic committee will take a very serious view of this and he will probably be disqualified as the national coach.'

Through an interpreter, Lee, who gave his address as the Olympic Village on Portland, pleaded guilty to a charge of driving with excess alcohol.

Controversy: The South Korea flag, left, was displayed by mistake before the women's Olympic soccer match between North Korea and Colombia in Glasgow while Greece's triple jumper Voula Papahristou, right, has been kicked out of the Games for a racist tweet which poked fun at Africans

The latest controversy to hit the Games comes after the South Korea flag was displayed by mistake before the women's
Olympic soccer match between North Korea and Colombia in Glasgow on Wednesday.

The North Korean team walked off the pitch after the incident before being persuaded to return and start the game.

Greece's triple jumper Voula Papahristou is also going home after posting a racist tweet on Twitter.

Her offending message – which was referring to reports of mosquitoes carrying the West Nile virus in her home country – read: ‘With so many Africans in Greece, at least the West Nile mosquitoes will eat home made food!’
