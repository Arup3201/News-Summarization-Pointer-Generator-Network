Jimmy Mubenga died from a heart attack in 2010

Three security guards working for G4S were yesterday spared the threat of prosecution over the death of Angolan deportee Jimmy Mubenga.

Lawyers at the Crown Prosecution Service said there was no evidence that could prove to a jury that the guards used illegal or deadly force.

Mr Mubenga, who was being deported after serving a jail sentence for causing actual bodily harm, died of a cardiac arrest after the guards restrained him while putting him aboard an aircraft at Heathrow.

The death of the father of five in 
October 2010 provoked a wave of protest and G4S was stripped of the Home
Office contract to supervise removals of deportees shortly afterwards.

Yesterday his widow Adrienne Makenda Kambana said the three guards had escaped the law.

‘We are distraught my husband has been taken away from me and my children have lost their father,’ she said.

‘He
was crying for help before he was killed. We can’t understand why the 
officers and G4S are not answerable to the law and we or any other 
member of the public would be.’

The Crown Prosecution Service considered four possible charges that could have been brought against the three guards over 46-year-old Mr Mubenga’s cardiorespiratory collapse. In all cases lawyers considered there was not enough evidence to prove their guilt to a jury.

Senior Crown Advocate Gaon Hart said that in order to secure a conviction for gross negligence manslaughter a prosecution would have to prove that the victim was held bent over with his head either on or below his knees for enough time to show it was the actions of the security guards alone that had caused the death.

The CPS said there was no evidence to prove to a jury that the three G4S guards used illegal or deadly force against Mr Mubenga

Mr Hart said that there were ‘conflicting witness accounts of the manner in which Mr Mubenga was restrained.

‘No witness had an unrestricted or uninterrupted view of what happened, and there is no clear picture of what happened in that key window of time to be able to convince a court that Mr Mubenga was held in the “severely splinted” position for a sufficient period of time.’ 

He said there had been a breach of duty by the guards, but the way Mr Mubenga was held was not severe enough for a prosecution.

Mr Hart added: ‘It is not enough to tell a jury what may have caused a person’s death; I have to have sufficient evidence that there is a realistic prospect of proving it to them beyond reasonable doubt, and in these circumstances the evidence did not satisfy that test.’ He rejected charges of misconduct in public office or unlawful act manslaughter for similar reasons.

G4S was found to have training methods that were flawed and suffered shortcomings, but the company had followed Whitehall-approved training methods and a jury would not consider the flaws amounted to corporate manslaughter.

Instead Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer QC has ordered a rebuke to the company, in the form of a letter from Mr Hart which will ‘highlight concerns’.

Mr Hart added that he understood the decision was not the one Mr Mubenga’s family hoped for, and he offered to meet them to explain it in person.

The family’s solicitor Mark Scott said: ‘The evidence is that Mr Mubenga died after crying for help whilst under restraint.

It is a surprise and shock that the DPP has not learned the lessons of earlier decisions and still sees fit to act as judge and jury rather than allowing the normal path of criminal justice to be followed.’
