Putting his foot down: Ferguson immediately decreed that no player under the age of 23 - no matter their standing in the team - should be allowed to order a sporty model

Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has banned the club's young stars from driving flashy sports cars from new sponsors Chevrolet.

The club recently signed a multi-million-pound deal with the American car giant, who will become  the name on the club's shirts from the start of the 2014-15 season.

As a gesture of goodwill, Chevrolet 
immediately offered United's first-team stars a choice of luxury cars.

And unsurprisingly, many of the club's big names plumped for the 198mph Corvette supercar.

However, Ferguson
 immediately intervened and decreed that no player under the age of 23 -
 no matter their standing in the team - should be allowed to order a 
sporty model.

This 
means players such as young striker Danny Welbeck, 21, and defenders 
Phil Jones, 20, Chris Smalling, 22, and Rafael da Silva, 22, will be 
banned from driving anything not approved by Ferguson.

Instead only the more experienced 
drivers, such as Rio Ferdinand, 33, and Ryan Giggs, 38, will be allowed 
behind the wheel of the £32,000 sports car.

In
 2009, United midfielder Christiano Ronaldo wrote off his £200,000 
Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano  into a tunnel wall as he drove to United's 
training complex in Manchester.

And
 in 2003 reserve striker Jimmy Davis died in a collision with a lorry as
 he drove his grey 3-series BMW in the early hours of the morning on the
 M40.

The move is a classic case of 
Ferguson - a known micro-manager of his players - ensuring his young 
stars don't get too big for their boots.

Ferguson is acutely aware of how times have changed since taking over in
 1986 and has accepted that he cannot control every facet of his 
players' lives the way he used to.

Stalled: United's youngsters won't be driving one of these iconic Chevrolet Corvettes

young striker Danny Welbeck, 21, right, will be banned from driving 
anything not approved by Ferguson

But the 68-year-old manager still becomes irritated by the manner in 
which young players are given too much too soon.

Two years ago, for example, it emerged 
he told players in the club's youth squads they were not allowed to wear
 coloured football boots.

While
 first-team stars such as Wayne Rooney, Dimitar Berbatov and Ryan Giggs 
are free to wear what they like in order to keep up with the demands of 
their sponsors, Ferguson decreed that youth team and academy players
 must wear black.

An Old Trafford source said: 'Sir Alex doesn't 
like young players to get ahead of themselves. He thinks their feet 
should be on the ground.'

Last night a United spokesperson confirmed: 'As with most automotive partnerships, Chevrolet will be offering players a car. The model will be dependent on their time at the club and driving experience.'
