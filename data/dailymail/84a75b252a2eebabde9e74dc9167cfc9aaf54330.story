Atletico Madrid defender Diego Godin is set to discuss a £27million move to German giants Bayern Munich.

The 28-year-old has been targeted by Pep Guardiola as a replacement for Javi Martinez, who has been ruled out for the rest of the year with injury.

Martinez suffered cruciate ligament damage during Bayern's defeat at the hands of rivals Borussia Dortmund in the German Super Cup last week.

Reversal: Bayern boss Pep Guardiola originally insisted that his transfer dealings were done for the summer

Man for the occasion: He also netted the opener against Real Madrid in the Champions League Final

Guardiola had previously stated that his transfer dealings were done this summer, but the injury to Martinez has forced his hand.

Godin was one of Atletico's stars last season, starting 51 games in all competitions and netting the crucial equaliser in their final game away at Barcelona to secure the draw that Diego Simeone's side needed to clinch the La Liga title.

And he also played a key role in their run to the Champions League Final, scoring the opener against Real Madrid in their eventual 4-1 defeat.

Godin also played all four games for Uruguay at the World Cup, as they crashed out in the last-16 following a 2-0 defeat to Colombia. 

Simeone has targeted Liverpool's Daniel Agger as a potential replacement should Godin complete a move to the German giants.

Agger has told manager Brendan Rodgers he wants to leave having fallen further down the Anfield pecking order following the signing of Dejan Lovren this summer.
