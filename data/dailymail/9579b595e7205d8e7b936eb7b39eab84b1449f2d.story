TV chef Lorraine Pascale with one of her dishes 

It was about time someone addressed the problem of sodden greens, gloopy custard and crusty pasta dishes served in their hundreds of thousands every day on almost every flight path under the sun.

That person is TV presenter, chef and cookery book author Lorraine Pascale who has spent the last six months working with Virgin Atlantic's in-flight catering departments to try to improve their meals.

The upshot is a vastly superior menu for Virgin's upper class passengers and rejuvenated meals for children throughout the cabin - but  no change for those in standard class.

Lorraine's upper class dishes – inspired by her love of healthy, light eating  – will include Thai beef salad with roasted pine nuts and chilli dressing or a warm salmon and lentils with chorizo dish with asparagus and balsamic dressing.

The children's dishes, on rotation over the next 12 months, will include 'marvellous' mac'n'cheese with pancetta pieces, crispy tender chicken strips with potato wedges and crushed peas, sweet and sour pork balls with sunshine rice and a Mum's chilli con carne with calypso rice.

Not a soggy green in sight: the TV chef has designed four kid's meals including  mac'n'cheese with pancetta

The new dishes will be showcased on Virgin's  B787-9 flight to Atlanta on October 23, then added to services departing the UK from October 28.

Reuben Arnold, Brand and Customer Engagement Director at Virgin Atlantic, said: 'We are thrilled to be working with Lorraine. She is the biggest ever debut cooking writer in Britain and to be collaborating with her to create these dishes has been really inspiring.

'Dishes such as 'Mum's chilli con carne with calypso rice will hopefully get our younger passengers very excited to be eating meals with a home-cooked feel. 

'All of Lorraine's dishes reflect her philosophy of food, which is to champion fresh, nutritious and simple meals – something that is so important to our customers.'

Lorraine Pascale says: 'I have really enjoyed working the team at Virgin on these dishes, which I very much hope customers will enjoy. The aim was to create healthy and sophisticated menus for the Upper Class customers and wholesome, delicious and fun meals for the children's offering. 

'I think we've achieved it – bon appetit!'

Lorraine was keen that passengers would be 'excited by what they see'. She added, 'For me, when I fly, I like to have something light, healthy and with lots and lots of flavour.'

Not everyone has been enamoured by the news, however, and some have taken to Facebook to vent their ire.

Princess Watson-Smith wrote underneath an announcement of the collaboration: 'So hang on, upper class get upper quality food as they can afford the upper prices? So lower paying people are second rate and only deserve lower quality food but children of both upper and lower are the same? 

'I don't know who I'm annoyed at more!'

Not for all: upper class travellers will enjoy salmon with lentils, chorizo, asparagus and a balsamic dressing

Another, Sharron Prince added: 'Upper class ... Shouldn't we all be treated equally ... Some family's save very hard to fly with virgin for their holidays so don't they deserve to treated as upper class?'

Linda Paul rode to the TV chef's defence saying: 'Good on you Lorraine! Love all your recipes and well written cook books. Thank you' 

Whether you can afford it or not, hopefully it will inspire more airlines to up their game and is a taster of good things to come.
