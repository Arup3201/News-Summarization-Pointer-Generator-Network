Drivers should wear sun cream in their cars even when the windows are closed, doctors have advised.

They warned that the sun’s damaging rays can penetrate glass, raising the risk of skin cancer.

While glass will block UVB rays, which cause sunburn, the more-damaging UVA rays pass through.

Despite people spending more time driving than gardening or exercising, they are less likely to wear sunscreen when in a car than outdoors, it was found.

Just 15 per cent of people said they used sun cream ‘most of the time’ while driving – a figure described as ‘dismal’ by the researchers from Stony Brook University in the State of New York.

In contrast, 38 per cent said they would normally wear sunscreen when outdoors.

Surprisingly, those with a history of skin cancer were no more likely to wear sun cream than others.

The US researchers asked 225 men and women to fill in a survey about their driving habits, including how often they drove with the window open and when they wore sunscreen.

Many had been treated for skin cancer in the past.

Two-thirds of those questioned believed they didn’t need to wear sun cream if the windows were closed.

Dr Dennis Kim, one of the researchers, said: ‘Like the majority of patients in our study, I too used to feel protected from the sun while in a vehicle, unfortunately this is not true.

‘Because such a large proportion of a person’s cumulative sun exposure occurs while in a vehicle, automobile-related UVA exposure is a considerable public health concern.’

While windscreens and tinted windows offer protection, much of the sun’s rays pass through side and rear windows.

Dr Kim cited previous research which showed that laminated glass in windscreens blocks 98 per cent of harmful UVA rays from the sun.

But these rays – which penetrate deep into the skin causing ageing, eye damage and skin cancers – can easily penetrate the non-laminated glass of side and rear windows, with at least 80 per cent passing through.

Is the parasol absolutely necessary?

Dr Kim said: ‘The good news is that this damage can be limited by wearing sun creams, long sleeve shirts, and protective eyewear.’

He added that although he did his research in America, Britons should also take care, especially in the summer.

Non-malignant melanoma, the most prevalent type of skin cancer affecting 100,000 people in the UK each year, was found to occur more often on the arm closest to the driver’s window.

Among those who took part in the study, this was the left arm. But research from countries with predominantly right-hand drive cars, such as the UK, found higher numbers of the cancers on the right arm.

The study, published in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, also found that when people did apply sunscreen, it was frequently in the wrong place.

For instance, it was often not applied to arms and hands – despite them being exposed to the sun while driving.

Yinka Ebo, of Cancer Research UK, said: ‘Although this is a small study that relied on skin cancer patients recalling what they did in the past, it’s a reminder to consider sun protection even for everyday activities like driving.

‘Windows can block UVB rays but most don’t block UVA rays – so your skin may still be getting damaged.’
