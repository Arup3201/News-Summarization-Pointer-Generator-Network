Just days after a prominent New York horse trainer was shot dead at his Long Island, New York home, police say they are looking for a longtime friend and former roommate in connection with the killing.

Ross Reisner, 50, was shot dead by a bullet fired through the window of his Setauket house on Tuesday evening.

The 'person of interest' in the shooting death, is a former American Express executive, Brett Knight, who had a psychotic breakdown after he sued the company after claiming bosses fired him for being HIV-positive.

The victim's brother, Ian Reisner, 
said 'there was something weird going on, some bad blood' with a friend 
Ross had known for more than 20 years.

'He
was an old friend and now this craziness,' Ian Reisner told Daily News 
while his family sat shiva at their mother’s Manhattan apartment.

A police source confirmed to Daily News that they are searching for a friend.

Investigators have refused to speculate on a motive for the shooting.

Gunned down: The attacker is believed to have fired through the window of the couple's home on Tuesday

'This
is not a random act,' said Det. Lt. Jack Fitzpatrick, commander of the 
Suffolk homicide squad. 'Given the information we possess, I believe 
they were fired on by someone who was intentionally firing on them.'

A neighbor of Reisner's, who only identified herself as Linda, said the gunshots were 'frightening.'

'I came running to the front of house and there was a million police cars and ambulances,' she said.

Reisner's brother, also told ABC News there was some bad blood between his brother and an old friend with whom he had a dispute.

'There
seemed to be some falling out…it is speculated that he may be the cause
or catalyst of this tragic ending of my brother's life,' he said.

Meanwhile, Newsday reports that police are using two pieces of evidence in the 
search for a suspect: a dead bird placed anonymously on the doorstep of 
Ross Reisner's home on Upper Sheep Pasture Road four months ago, and a 
harassment complaint filed in court by he and his partner, Kevin Murray.

They had filed charges
against Mr Knight who used lived in the basement of the home for a 
couple of years and there is now a warrant out for his arrest.

Knight
allegedly 'alarmed, harassed and annoyed' Mr Murray and sent him 'an 
anonymously mailed package and several disturbing text messages,' 
according to a complaint filed less than a month ago.

Knight,
45, was charged with second-degree harassment, a misdemeanor, but 
failed to appear before a judge in First District Court in Central Islip
on September 4th to answer the charge.

Stake out: Police markers are left in the couple's lawn. The gunman is believed to have fired from the yard

On Tuesday night, the couple had finished dinner at 
about 8.45pm when several bullets were fired, killing Mr Reisner and 
grazing the arm of Kevin Murray, whom he had been in a relationship with
for 26 years.

Neighbors in quiet, wealthy Setauket, on Long Island's Gold Coast, recalled hearing gunfire and screams for help.

'I did hear a male voice screaming, "Oh God, help him. Please help me. Help him," neighbor Michelle O’Toole told CBS New York.

The
victim's family said a high-powered weapon was used in the attack and 
Suffolk County police commander John Fitzpatrick said: 'It's clear that person was firing at them.'

He
added that the gunman had stood in the couple's yard and waited for the
men to appear in the window before shooting. The suspect is then 
believed to have fled on foot.

Ross Reisner was a well-known equestrian in the North East, who had been competing since he was a teenager.

He had recently opened a horse farm in Mattituck with childhood friend Bobby Ginsberg, and the two had been enjoying a successful start to their venture.

'When it came to his training and his riding, he was very serious and dedicated to it - he loved to win,' Mr Ginsberg said. 'On his downtime, he was just one of the funniest people you'd ever hope to meet.'

He told Three Village Patch he was shocked that his friend and business partner had been murdered, and added: 'Everybody knew Ross. He always had clients at the horse shows. He was always striving to be a great trainer and rider.'

The victim's brother said: 'He taught members of high profile families how to ride. He was at the top of his profession.'

Mr Reisner was shot dead in the $600,000 home the couple had been remodeling.

'They had just built their dream house five-and-a-half years ago,' Ms O’Toole, who says she heard at least six gun shots, said.

Mr Reisner was due to take a riding team to the U.S. Equestrian Federation finals in New Jersey next month.

As news of his death reached equestrian circles, many posted tributes to their trainer and fellow horseman on Facebook.

Grace Duy described him as 'not just an amazing trainer but an extraordinary friend.'

Many others, including Alexandra Maracic, posted photos of Mr Reisner walking show jumping courses with them and offering advice at competitions.

Shanette Barth Cohen, who runs the Hampton Classic horse show, said: 'He was very well-liked and it’s a real shock and sad for the whole Long Island equestrian community.'
