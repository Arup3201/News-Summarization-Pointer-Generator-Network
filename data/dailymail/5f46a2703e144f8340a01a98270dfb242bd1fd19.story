The world witnessed two galactic events on Friday that had only a one in 100 million chance of happening on the same day, according to astronomy expert Meg Urry.

The asteroid that flew within 17,000 miles of Earth was a once-in-100-years event, while the meteor that exploded over Russia was a once-in-a-decade occurrence, Urry wrote on CNN.com.

Multiplying those two probabilities together results in a one in one hundred probability that they would happen on the same day.

Space rock: Although it came uncomfortably close to the Earth, the asteroid was only visible with a good pair of binoculars

Spectacular sky: The Urals region was struck by falling meteorite fragments which fell in the city of Chelyabinsk, 900 miles east of Moscow and close to the Kazakhstan border

Ice breaker: An official standing near an eight-meter hole left by the meteorite in the surface of a frozen lake near the town of Chebarkul

Unexpected
sight: A terrifying meteorite shower left a thousand people injured, 
buildings devastated and the mobile network wiped out when it hit Russia
this morning

Terrifying: Brightly burning rocks could be seen for hundreds of kilometres as they crashed at around 9.20am local time and one bystander described it 'like a scene from the Armageddon movie'

The meteor, which weighed 40 tons, injured almost almost 1,000 people with flying fragments of glass and rubble. It penetrated Earth's atmosphere at a speed of at least 33,0000mph.

As it raced through the sky, the 50-foot 
wide chunk of space rock compressed the air ahead of it, creating the 
enormous temperatures that meant it exploded in a fireball somewhere 
between 18 and 32 miles above the ground at around 9.20am local time.

Although some debris fell to earth, ‘whipping up a pillar of ice, water and steam’ and creating a 20-foot-wide crater, the damage in nearby towns was actually caused by shockwaves created by the meteor breaking the sound barrier and then exploding.

Hours later,  the 150-foot, 130,000-ton asteroid successfully skimmed past Earth.

It was the nearest fly-by for an object from space of this size since records began.

Although scientists said there was little chance of asteroid 2012 DA14 hitting the planet, if it did, it would have inflicted 1,000 times more damage than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.

Its closest approach, passing within 17,000 miles (27,357 kilometers), which is closer than some satellites, was at 7.25pm, GMT.

Disaster: This graphic shows the sequence of events which led to the meteor crashing in Russia

Speed: Russia's space agency Roscosmos said the meteorite was travelling at a speed of 30 km (19 miles) per second and that such events were hard to predict

Interception: According to an unconfirmed report in Russia Today, the meteor was intercepted by Russian air defense

Shockwave: People heading to work in Chelyabinsk heard what sounded like an explosion, saw a bright light and then felt a shockwave

Of the meteor, Gulnara
Dudka, a resident of Chelyabinsk, 930 miles east of Moscow and the 
biggest city in the affected region, said: ‘I really thought it was 
doomsday.’

Teacher Valentina
Nikolayeva, who tried to protect her pupils from the force of the blast
said: ‘There was an unreal light that lit up all the classrooms.

‘That
kind of light doesn’t happen in life, only at the end of the world – 
then a trail appeared like from a plane but only ten times bigger.’

Amazingly, there
were no fatalities and most of the wounded were hurt by flying glass – 
some 1.8million square feet of which will have to be replaced.

Russian
news networks noted that the meteor struck just hours before the Earth 
was due had its closest recorded shave with an asteroid.

However, space 
experts said the arrival of the much larger asteroid was merely a 
coincidence.

Professor Alan 
Fitzsimmons, of Queens University Belfast, said there was ‘almost 
definitely’ no connection between the exploding meteor and asteroid 2012
DA14.

‘This is literally a cosmic coincidence, although a spectacular one,’ he said.

Prime minister Dmitry Medvedev said the meteor could be a symbol for the vulnerability of the economy – and the ‘whole planet’.

British
experts said that thousands of tons of material from space rains down 
on the Earth each day, but nearly all of it burns up and disintegrates 
far from the view of the naked eye.

Occasionally
a meteor can come so close that its explosion is felt, as happened 
yesterday, or a small meteorite or large asteroid can actually hit the 
planet.

Smoking: Pictures show a streak of smoke followed by several bright blasts of flames

Coincidence: Early indications are that the shower is unrelated to Asteroid 2012 DA14, which is due to skim the orbit of the Earth later today

High in the sky: The vapour trail of a falling meteorite is seen in the sky over the city of Chelyabinsk

Injured: A man identifying himself as Viktor poses for a photograph after receiving treatment for injuries after the meteorite shower hit the Russian region

Medical treatment: Many injured had bloodied faces from being hit by shards of glass broken in the explosions

Toll: Hundreds of people were injured, but there have been no reports of fatalities

Dr Simon Goodwin, an
astrophysicist from Sheffield University, said: ‘While events this big 
are rare, an impact that could cause damage and death could happen every
century or so.

'It very much depends on where it hits. A big enough 
meteor could cause significant immediate death and maybe cause climate 
change by releasing dust into the air – these are maybe every few 
thousand years.

‘And a really big impact occurs every few ten millions of years and can cause mass extinctions.  One killed the dinosaurs.

‘Scientifically
this is not hugely interesting. Probably its greatest importance is to 
make people realise that things fall from space all the time, and every 
now and then they can be dangerous.

‘And an impact in a heavily populated area could kill huge numbers of people with no warning or chance of stopping it.'

Sonic boom: Tim O'Brien, associate director of the University of Manchester's Jodrell Bank Observatory, said the injuries were caused when the meteor created a sonic boom causing windows to shatter

Explosion: Eyewitnesses spoke of several devastating explosions rocking buildings and shattering glass

Damaged: A zinc factory in Chelyabinsk was seen with a partially collapsed roof and walls in the morning after meteor pieces rained on the town

Moment of impact: A pair, seen on CCTV, cower from the impact as the window near them explodes

Injured: Four schoolchildren were known to have been injured from broken glass

Unexpected: Eyewitnesses spoke of several devastating explosions rocking buildings and shattering glass

One eyewitness Gulnara Dudka, in her 
20s, gave a dramatic account of the meteorite, telling how she feared 
'doomsday' had arrived, reported the Siberian Times.

'What was it? People said it was a plane that fell and exploded,' she said.

'I saw a bright blast from behind me. Everything was lit up, very bright light.

'It was like from Armageddon movie when the meteorite rain started, I really thought it was like doomsday.

'It was so scary especially the 
explosion. It was very strong. I am speechless. It was so strong. My 
camera couldn't reproduce how strong the bang was.'

'I was sitting at home and typing 
something on my computer. Suddenly there was a huge bright flash,' said 
Konstantin Zharinov, an historian and journalist from Chelyabinsk.

Hurt: A school in Chelyabinsk took a fair brunt of the explosion - four students were injured

Blown out: A building damaged by the shockwave from the meteorite

Surprise: Shocked residents look up in the sky with horror

Aftermath: People look at damage to a shop following the meteor shower

Shattered: The city of Chelyabinsk, 900 miles east of Moscow and close to the Kazakhstan border, took the brunt of the impact

'At first I thought something happened at my neighbours place but a minute later the sound of the explosion came.'

He said 'many lost their windows, glass is everywhere in the streets'.

Children were left panic-stricken as windows smashed at School Number 15 in Chelyabinsk.

'First there was an unreal light that
lit up all the classrooms on the right side of the school. That kind of
light doesn't happen in life, only at the end of the world, then a 
trail appeared like from a plane but only 10 times bigger,' said teacher
Valentina Nikolayeva.

Residents in one 19 storey block reported feeling the shockwaves of the explosions.

The sounds of car alarms and breaking 
windows could be heard in the area, said a witness, and there were 
reports that the internet and mobile networks were temporarily down.
