Police hunting clues to the murder of a young woman were today searching the former home of convicted killer Christopher Halliwell.

Forensic officers and police sniffer dogs were scouring the former home of the taxi driver in connection with the disappearance and death of Becky Godden.

Halliwell told police he killed 20-year-old Miss Godden - and led officers to her shallow grave - but his confession was ruled inadmissible by a judge because he had not been cautioned.

The 55-year-old is currently serving life in jail for the abduction and brutal murder of Sian O'Callaghan who vanished after leaving a nightclub in Swindon, Wiltshire, in March 2011 aged 22.

Police have now set up a forensic tent outside Halliwell's former home in Swindon in relation to the an investigation into Miss Godden's disappearance

After Halliwell took officers to where he buried Miss O'Callaghan in Oxfordshire, Halliwell asked then Detective Supertintendent Steve Fulcher for a cigarette in return for showing police 'another one.'

He the took police to a field in Eastleach, Gloucestershire, where Miss Godden's body was found.

Despite his confession, Halliwell did not go on trial for her murder because police had not respected arrest guidelines.

Miss Godden, a drug-addicted prostitute, was last seen alive by a police officer in Swindon on December 27, 2002. She had not been reported missing to the police because her family believed she was living in Bristol working through her problems.

This morning, a forensic tent was put up outside Halliwell's former semi-detached house in Swindon and a police officer stood outside while searches were taking place.

The house belonged to Halliwell before he was convicted of Miss O'Callaghan's murder, by which time he had moved down the street.

The current owners of the house have been forced to move out while police searches take place and have no connection to the investigation.

Speaking outside the house, Detective Chief Inspector Sean Memory said: 'I believe this house is linked to the murder of Becky Godden.

'We are focusing our attention on this property as part of the ongoing investigation and have organised a specialist team comprised of over 30 staff.

'These officers are concentrating their search for any items which may be related to Becky's murder or may assist with the investigation into her death.

'We have a number of crime scene investigators who will conduct meticulous fingertip searches of the property.

'This will include the removal of flooring, exploring space behind walls and loft areas and a methodical search carried out until I am satisfied that the entire house has been thoroughly examined.'

The search is expected to take around a week.

Det Supt Fulcher, who was suspended over his mishandling of the original case, resigned from Wiltshire Police in May this year after he was investigated by the police watchdog and found guilty of gross misconduct.

Halliwell has also been linked with the disappearances of at least three other young women across the West Country, but has never been charged.

A detective in charge of the latest probe said: 'These officers are concentrating their search for any items which may be related to Becky's murder or may assist with the investigation into her death'

Miss Godden's mother, Karen Edwards, has previously criticised the force's suspension of Det Supt Fulcher, who she credits as a 'hero' for finding out what had happened to her missing daughter.

The latest searches come after police teams scouring an area alongside a pond earlier this year found boots thought to have belong to Miss O'Callaghan, along with the remains of a shotgun and up to 600 other items that could be linked to crime.

Det Chief Insp Memory said today: 'Each item has now been reviewed and a number are being sent for further expert analysis.'

Officers discovered the pile of items under a layer of mud, as well as a chunky knit cardigan.

The major effort at the rural spot, near the quiet village of Ramsbury, Wiltshire, was stepped up after the discovery on May 15 of a boot, which police suspect belonged to Miss O'Callaghan.

As officers held a press briefing near the pond on May 16 to announce their finding, a second boot was found. Further searches revealed the remains of a shotgun.

Detectives suggested at the time that the items found at the site may be the key to solving other murders.
