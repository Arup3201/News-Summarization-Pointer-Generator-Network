Saggy, wrinkly knees are, along with translucent, aged hands, are one of the biggest indicators of age, and one that even A-listers such as super-fit Catherine Zeta-Jones and Demi Moore fall prey to.

Now a new procedure aims to turn back the march of time by firming up sagging skin and reducing fat, all in the space of your lunch hour.

While previously the only sure-fire way 
to lift skin that had lost its elasticity was through surgery, which can
 be both painful and expensive, the new ‘knee raiser’ treatment aims to 
offer similar results using a combination of infrared light and vacuum 
therapy.

Even super-fit stars such a Demi Moore, 51, right, and Catherine Zeta Jones, 44, left, can't avoid kninkles

The non-surgical procedure uses a combination of the infrared light, vacuum and bi-polar radio frequency to cause deep heating of the fat cells and the surrounding connective and underlying collagen fibres.

This is designed to increase circulation, lymphatic drainage, cellular metabolism, resulting in skin firmness and a lifting effect.

One of the major plus points of the Vela Shape procedure is that it usually takes 
about an hour to an hour and a half, and requires little to no down time, 
meaning you could even fit it into a long lunch break.

No matter how healthy a person, the natural progression of time takes a toll on the appearance of the legs, with older knees (right) tending to have less elasticity than younger legs (left)

Some surgeons say the only sure-fire way to lift skin that has lost its elasticity is through surgery, which can be both painful and expensive

And unlike many other non-surgical procedures that promise results with no negatives, the Vela Shape technique, which is available in clinics across the UK, has been favourably studied in peer reviewed medical journals.

However, at £350 a treatment, with up to three treatments needed to banish severe sagging, this method of correction is not kind on the wallet.

Additionally many plastic surgeons have reservations as to its efficacy.

Speaking to the Mail Online, plastic surgeon and BAAPS member Bryan Mayou warns that the costly treatment may leave people expecting the same results as surgery but failing to deliver.

'If you want change your knees altered, liposuction can be quite effective and removing pockets of fat around them, and on very rare occasions, where there is a large amount of baggy skin, a skin excision can be performed to lift it.

'With these sort of treatments people shouldn't expect too much, and they
 shouldn't be saving up for this for this kind of procedure.'

Respected plastic surgeon Professor Kirwan says: 'The Vela Shape is a great machine for temporary skin tightening and smoothing but there is no evidence that I am aware of that it produces effects equivalent to surgical skin excision and lifting.

'Nor is it permanent. It is an expensive treatment that has to be repeated six times and is best combined with weight loss and exercise. Sadly the reality is never as convincing as the hype.

'Realistic expectations on the patient's part will produce a happy client. Unrealistic claims will end in disappointment.'
