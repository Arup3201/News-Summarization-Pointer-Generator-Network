Belgian police have arrested a camouflage-clad Slovakian man after finding a gun and chainsaw in his car - after hundreds of people were evacuated from the nearby European Parliament.

The suspect, identified as a Slovak national born in 1982, was deemed to be acting suspiciously, and told police officers that he wanted to meet the European president, prosecutors said.

Police then sealed off an area around the man's parked car until they could establish that it contained no explosives. 

What they found was a chainsaw and a gun.

He is facing charges of 'threatening an attack, possession of an illegal weapon and unauthorized possession of a firearm requiring a license.' 

A judge will determine on Tuesday whether the man faces charges. 

Around 500 people from four European Parliament buildings in central Brussels were evacuated as a precautionary measure and a bomb squad was called in to search the vehicle. 

Police found a firearm and a chainsaw in the car but no explosives, according to the public prosecutor's office. 

Officers were alerted to the car after they detained a man behaving suspiciously near the city’s parliament early this morning.

The suspect, who showed no signs of aggression throughout, declined to explain his behavior to police officers.

But the man 'said that he wanted to meet the president of the parliament,' a prosecutor's office statement said.

Police gave the all-clear just before 1pm local time, and staff returned to their offices. 

Belgium has been on high alert since the terror attacks in Paris last month. The country has deployed soldiers to protect locations,including embassies and European and Jewish institutions.

In mid-January, police carried out a series of raids on suspected foreign fighters in Belgium and France, acting on information that a terrorist cell was on the verge of launching an attack.  

Two suspects were killed in one raid, in and around the eastern town of Verviers on January 15, when authorities claimed they prevented an imminent and major terror attack on police.

Last week, Belgian authorities detained four suspects during an anti-terror sweep linked to the recruitment of potential jihadis to fight in Syria.

Police searched 22 homes, mostly in northeastern Belgium on Friday but found no weapons, explosives or ammunition.

The federal prosecutor's office said in a statement the sweep was aimed at "uncovering the organization behind the recruitment and sending" of individuals to Syria.

It stressed the operation was not linked to the Paris attacks of early this month nor to the January 15 operation.
