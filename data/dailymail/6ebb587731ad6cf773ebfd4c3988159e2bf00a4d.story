Tottenham fans who chant the Y-word at White Hart Lane will no longer be arrested - unless an official complaint is made against them.

But opposition fans who sing anti-Semitic holocaust songs at Tottenham fans at the ground will still face charges, the Metropolitan police have announced. 

Constable Steve Payne, Football Intelligence for the Met, told the Tottenham Hotspur Supporters Trust (THST) of the development at a meeting last Monday.

Last September the FA warned that using the Y-word was 'derogatory and offensive' and could amount to a criminal offence - and that Tottenham fans could face arrest for singing it.

Tottenham fans have always insisted that they never use the Y-word maliciously, and a THST statement issued after the FA's warnings said:  'THST is categorically against ejections and banning orders for use of the term by Tottenham supporters in a match environment.

'Our view has always been that should Spurs’ fans’ use of the Y** identity come to an end, this should be as a result of the feeling among the Spurs community that it was time to move on.

'This issue has always been of the utmost importance to us and while we recognise that Spurs fans use of the Y-word and associated identity may have caused some upset to members of the Jewish community, we sincerely believe no Spurs fan uses the term in a malicious way. We do not in any way condone racist language being used by football fans.

'The word ‘Y**' was adopted over 30 years ago by Spurs fans to combat racist abuse aimed towards them at football by opposing fans. It developed into a strong identity status that brought Jewish and non-Jewish Spurs fans together in an incredible show of unity that is admired worldwide. That is what fighting racism within football should be about.'

On March 7 the Crown Prosecution Service discontinued cases made against three Totttenham fans arrested for using the Y-word. Eight arrests were made last season for racially aggravated offences at White Hart Lane.
