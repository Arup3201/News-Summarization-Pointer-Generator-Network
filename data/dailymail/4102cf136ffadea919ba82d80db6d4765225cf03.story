Unpopular opinion: Boston Globe columnist Stephen Kinzer (pictured) wrote a column published Thursday titled 'Joining the military doesn't make you a hero' 

As the nation remembered the deadliest attack against the American military in history, the Boston Globe sparked controversy by publishing a column against the hero-worship of our armed forces.

Columnist Stephen Kinzer wrote a piece called 'Joining the military doesn't make you a hero' in which he argues that idolizing those who volunteer for military service is relatively new and distracts from the 'disgraceful' treatment of veterans. 

Kinzer's comments were generally ridiculed online, with many Twitter users furious that the opinion piece was published on the 73rd anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor - a military disaster which resulted in the loss of 2,402 American servicemen and led the U.S. to enter World War II.

In his column, Kinzer writes that society has only recently started holding military members on a lofty pedestal, a development he believes is due to the military now being volunteer-only, which creates a 'small, self-contained caste' of soldiers 'cut off from the American mainstream'.

Since Americans no longer lose their civilian husbands, brothers or sons to conscripted service, most are unaware of what war is like and Kinzer says that 'distance' leads to the development of 'extravagant fantasies about soldiers'. 

'If we believe our soldiers are superheroes, it makes sense to send them to faraway battlefields to solve our perceived problems in the world,' Kinzer writes. 

Pointing to sporting events, where it has now become routine to bring a soldier out on the field or court at halftime for a salute to his service in Iraq or Afghanistan, Kinzer writes that these rituals feed 'the fantasy that military service turns one into a better, more selfless human being'.

While Kinzer says it is justified to admire soldiers who have performed brave acts, he critiques the idea that a uniform 'automatically' turns 'ordinary people into giants'.

Kinzer says there are plenty of other heroes outside the military, like nurses, teachers and community organizers who deserve equal praise. 

He adds that this kind of idolatry distracts from the way 'scandalous' way veterans are treated, citing high rates of unemployment, mental illness, homelessness, addiction, and suicide among retired servicemen 

'The soldier acknowledging cheers at a ball game is a fantasy figure we can easily admire. Veterans in need are more disturbing, so we keep them invisible. If we truly considered our uniformed fighters heroic, we would show them real gratitude rather than the phony kind that gives us a shiver of momentary pride but does them little good,' Kinzer writes. 

The article didn't receive a very warm welcome online, as several Twitter users, including a few veterans, lashed back at Kinzer for his opinion.

Iraq War veteran and champion logroller J.R. Salzman, who lost part of his right arm in 2006 after his vehicle was struck by an IED, was one of the first to respond, writing: 'According to Stephen Kinzer, being a community organizer is on par with being a soldier shipping off to war.'

Others felt Kinzer's piece was inappropriate to publish the column on a day the nation was mourning the Pearl Harbor attacks. 

'You're seriously defective and f***** in the head if you choose today to s*** on the military. Seek help,' one impassioned Twitter user wrote. 

However, some Twitter users did write that Kinzer made compelling points in his argument that turning soldiers into superheros fuels the American war machine.

Before becoming a columnist for the Boston Globe, Kinzer spent more than 20 years working for the New York Times as a foreign correspondent.

During his time at the Times, Kinzer covered stories in Central America, Eastern Europe and Turkey.

Kinzer also teaches international relations at Brown University and contributes to The Guardian and New York Review of Books.

Wrong time: Some Twitter users were unhappy Kinzer published his opinion piece on the 73rd anniversary of the attacks on Pearl Harbor - the deadliest loss of life in American military history. Above, veteran survivors hold their hands in salute at the memorial service in Hawaii on Sunday
