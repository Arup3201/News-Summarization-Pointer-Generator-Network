As a tribute to the five siblings killed in a tragic Texas trailer park fire, a local artist has stepped up and donated his time in crafting a set of personalized caskets for the children.

Siblings Noah, 15; Nicholas, 13; Julian, 9; Areyanah, 6; and Lilyana, 5, Ortiz died early Tuesday after their 70-foot mobile home in Edna, Texas was engulfed in flames.

Their father Johnny Hernandez Jr was able to get wife Annabel and their 4-year-old son Johnny III out of the house in time, but unfortunately the five other children became trapped and perished inside.

In memoriam: Local artist Trey Ganem designed caskets for five siblings who were victims of a mobile home fire in Edna, Texas, designing caskets based on the characters from Frozen for the two young girls

When local artist, and former hot rod designer, Trey Ganem found out about the disaster, he immediately volunteered to make the caskets free of charge and the community raised the funds to pay for the materials. 

'We want it to be more of a celebration of that person's life,' Ganem told KHOU.  '(We want) to give them a little bit of peace, that those were his babies. That represents my baby. That's not just another box.'

Oldest son Noah, who played on the Edna High School football team, got a casket with his jersey number, school colors a and will have his helmet adhered to the coffin. 

Nicholas was a gamer, so Ganem made him a Call of Duty-themed casket. Julian's love of WWE professional wrestling is shown on his coffin.

Little sisters Areyanah and Lilyana, meanwhile, received 'Frozen' themed coffins designed for each of the royal sisters in the hit Disney movie.

Ganem constructed and painted the five coffins in four days , and showed the gifts to their parents on Friday.

Designer: Ganem had worked for years as a hot rod designer and used his background to craft caskets that reflected each victim's life, putting a WWE design on Julian's

Ganem was originally going to create the coffins at cost, but the caskets are now going free to the victims' family after the community stepped in to pay the entire cost of materials. 

'This community has pulled together like none that I've seen for this family,' Ganem said. 

As of Saturday night, a separate online fund raised $50,000.

Witnesses to the blaze told Click2Houston that they heard the distraught father shouting 'I tried to get in there! I tried, I tried!' outside the home.

'We're taking it really hard,' the father's brother, Rico Hernandez, told the Advocate. 'It's probably one of the biggest tragedies in Edna, in all around.'

The cause of the fire is being investigated, although authorities have said it appears the flames started in the kitchen.

'It was an old trailer so maybe it was something electrical,' Rico Hernandez told the Advocate. 'I'm guessing it was cold last night so something with the heater.'

Survivors: The children's parents, Johnny Hernandez, 30, and Annabel Ortiz, 32, also survived the fire

Heartbreaking: The siblings, pictured together, were unable to escape when the home partially collapsed

Artist: The designer, Trey Ganem, felt his job was to bring a sense of comfort to the grieving family, the community raised funds to pay for materials

Photographs taken of the two- or three-bedroom home on Tuesday show it completely burned down.

By the time emergency services arrived, it was already completely engulfed in flames. 

Ortiz was taken to Citizens Medical Center, where she was listed in fair condition. She was treated for a gash to her arm, which she reportedly sustained when her husband pushed her from a window.

Her husband and their surviving son did not need medical attention.

Hernandez Jr.'s cellphone was found outside the house, the Advocate reported. He had taken photos of his children on Monday night and wanted to make sure he saved the images, his brother said.

Questions: Authorities are still looking into what caused the fire at the mobile home in Edna, Texas

'All of them were just popular, great kids,' Superintendent Robert O'Connor told The L.A. Times.

'It's devastating anytime you lose a child ... but to lose five at a one time, that is unbelievable.' 

Edna is a town of 5,500 residents about 100 miles southwest of Houston.

The high school, where Noah was a starter for the football team, has canceled upcoming sports games and brought in grief counselors across its campuses.
