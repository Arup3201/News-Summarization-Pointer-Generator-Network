Germany reacted in wonder and disbelief as their national team thrashed Brazil 7-1 to reach the final of the World Cup.

Even tabloid Bild found themselves lost for words as they tried to document what had unfolded in a remarkable semi-final at the Estadio Mineirao in Belo Horizonte.

'Without words' ran the headline on Wednesday's front cover as the paper allowed the scoreline and celebration picture do the talking.

Germany blew Brazil away in a sensational 18-minute spell in the first-half that yielded five goals - two from Toni Kroos and one apiece for Thomas Muller, Miroslav Klose and Sami Khedira.

Klose's goal saw him overtake Brazil legend Ronaldo as the leading goalscorer in World Cup tournaments, with 16 now to his name.

Substitute Andre Schurrle added two further goals after the break to extend the lead to seven, before Oscar scored a late consolation.

Lukas Podolski was straight on to Twitter with a dressing room celebration picture, writing: 'Amazing win!! Rio we are coming...'

He was shown alongside Khedira, Schurrle and Klose in the changing room and the latter praised the team's togetherness afterwards.

'You could see in training that we harmonise greatly,' said Klose.

'We are one unit and you can see that in the pitch. It was so important that our set-pieces work.

'Toni brings the ball exactly there where it belongs. I was hit during my goal so there was no chance to do a (celebration) flip.'

Muller admits they were surprised by the margin of victory, although he accepts they benefited hugely from Brazil's wide-open approach.

'You couldn't expect that at all but you can see on that how different games can develop,' he said.

'The spaces were bigger today than against defence-minded teams. We benefited from that overwhelmingly, at one point you have broken the opponent.

'Now we have to keep pushing, give full power and get the cup.'

Kroos admitted Germany’s players were stunned by the manner of the humiliation.

He said: ‘We realised the Brazilians were not so clear in their actions in the first few minutes, and we took advantage of that. Sometimes we couldn’t even believe it ourselves, that it was 5-0 after only a few minutes. We delivered an outstanding match today. 

‘We delivered a marvellous performance. But we’re here to become world champions, and we’re not world champions yet. That’s the feeling in the dressing room: we have a tough task ahead still.’

Former German players took to Twitter to celebrate the fantastic result. Michael Ballack was pictured holding up seven fingers, Jurgen Klinsmann tweeted in capital letters and Dietmar Hamann summed up the team's qualities.

He posted on Twitter: 'Master class from Germany. Clinical, organised, hard working, unselfish and humble. Very proud of the team. One to go.'

Germany coach Joachim Low believes Brazil cracked under the pressure of being hosts.

Low said: 'Let's put it into context: the hosts were unable to deal with the pressure.

'We had a clear, persistent game-plan and if we were courageous and believed in our own strengths, we would win this match.

'That the result would be so emphatic was not to be expected. Scoring three in four minutes the hosts were in shock, confused, and never returned to their original organisation. We were extremely cool and realised they were cracking up, and we took advantage of that.'

Low said Germany must turn their attention to Sunday's final, and that he understood what Brazil must now be going through.

He added: 'We've won this match. We're in the final of the World Cup, against a different opponent. We were lucky that the hosts were shell-shocked. Now we must prepare well for the final.

'I remember once losing to Italy in Germany when everyone wanted us to go to the final. We lost in the 119th minute back in 2006, so we knew how Scolari feels, how the Brazilian team feel, and the people in Brazil feel right now.'

Wolfgang Niersbach, president of the German Football Association, hailed a momentous occasion.

'This is an historic day for German football,' he said.

Thrilled: Jurgen Klinsmann was obviously and understandably thrilled by the performance

Seventh heaven: Michael Ballack salutes the victory while working as a TV pundit

Praise: Former German international Didier Hamann summed up his feelings after the result on Twitter

'I don't know what to say. Sensational, like a fairytale - they are all too weak expressions. That was football from another galaxy.

'I am so happy for the coach (Joachim Low) and the team. Now we want to do the next step.

'We can't go crazy now even if I would like to. Now we have to get the fourth star (title).'
