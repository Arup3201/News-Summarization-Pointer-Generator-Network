The Football League are in talks with Leicester City regarding Financial Fair Play rules, after their accounts revealed a £20.8million loss that exceeds the £8million allowed by clubs outside the Premier League.

Leicester published their 2013-14 accounts on Tuesday, with the Football League reacting Wednesday by saying talks with the club who are now at the foot of the Premier League table are 'ongoing', according to the BBC.

Leicester believe that £13million of the loss was 'allowable' because much of it relates to the club's promotion from the Championship to the Premier League.

The club could be fined if it is adjudged to have broken the rules.

The Foxes are currently rooted to the bottom of the Premier League on 18 points.

They are seven points adrift of safety and they travel to the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday to take on Manchester City.
