Nearly two dozen teens have been arrested at high schools in southern California after undercover police officers posed as students for an entire semester to rat out drug-dealing on campus.

Serina Ramirez, 18, and Erick De La Cruz, 19, were arrested at Perris High School last Thursday and 20 minors from that school and nearby Paloma High School in Menifee were also booked on drug-related charges. Three additional students weren't in school that day and remain at large.

Two deputies, a woman at Perris and a man at Paloma, had been posing as 16 or 17-year-old students since the start of the school year in an operation to find the source of drugs at the two Riverside County high schools.

Throughout the probe, the deputies, who haven't been named, seized marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, methamphetamine, hashish and various prescription pills.

Lt. Paul Bennett said most of the drug buys were for small amounts of marijuana. Officers also served warrants at the homes of two of the students arrested.

After the drug bust, rumors were flying around both schools as students tried to pick the moles among them.

Some were convinced they knew who it was and others were worried more undercover police officers could be among them, with some even pinpointing a substitute teacher who struck them as suspicious.

According to the Riverside Press Enterprise, officers stormed into classrooms with photos of 25 suspects and proceeded to handcuff all but the the absentees in front of everyone.

Student Anthony Rodriguez, 16, told the Press Enterprise the whole bust was over within minutes.

'They knew who they were looking for and exactly how to get there,' he said.

But Trevor Steinrichter, 16, said it was frightening while it lasted. The officers showed up in his history class, he told the newspaper.

'Scary. I saw my friend get arrested,' he said.

Bruce Hollen, 16, said it was disturbing that a deputy was posing as a student.

'You think you can trust people - you just never know,' he said.

Bennett said the sheriff's department has used the undercover tactic at schools in the area before, but the deputies selected to go undercover this year received additional training, particularly about special needs students and avoiding entrapment.

He explained all students arrested Thursday were in general education classes, not special needs programs.

Perris Union High School District superintendent Jonathon Greenberg said the schools were on board with the investigation after the sheriff's office approached them about it earlier this year.

'It was a question of what we could do to assist them,' he told the Press Enterprise. 'This is a very well-researched program. The people in it are all professionals.'

He added that only three people within the district knew what was going on, and no one at either school had been told of the undercover deputies. Board members learned of the probe Wednesday night ahead of Thursday's arrests.
