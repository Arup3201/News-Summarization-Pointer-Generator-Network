There may be fewer hours of sunlight as we head towards winter, but it could still be possible to get your daily dose of Vitamin D thanks to a revolutionary mushroom.

Eating just three of the Active Health mushrooms, sold by M&S, provides 100 per cent of an adult’s recommended daily allowance.

The store spent five years developing the mushrooms, which taste just like the regular variety and also contain Vitamin B5 to fight fatigue and potassium to help maintain normal blood pressure.

Marks & Spencer says eating just three of its new mushrooms will give you your daily dose of Vitamin D

The mushrooms, which sell for £1.20 for 200 grams, are grown in County Monaghan, Ireland, and naturally enriched with the vitamin by exposure to light.

Studies have shown that UV light stimulates the mushrooms to convert natural sterols into Vitamin D.

Normally mushrooms are commercially produced in dark warehouses as they do not need sunlight to grow, but the M&S mushrooms receive a carefully-measured amount of bright light to simulate sunlight and trigger the Vitamin D-producing action.

The main source of the vitamin for humans is sunlight but it also occurs in some foods such as oily fish and eggs and is necessary for strong bones and teeth.

As many as 70 per cent of Britons are thought to have a Vitamin D insufficiency, which is believed to be caused by diet and the country’s poor weather and short winter days.

Claire Hughes, M&S nutritionist, said: ‘It’s taken us over five years to bring these mushrooms to our shelves, but it has been worth the wait – they provide 100 per cent of the recommended daily allowance of Vitamin D and are a delicious way of making dinner even healthier.’

Last year scientists presented a study at the American Society for Biochemistry and Microbiology meeting in Boston showing that any mushrooms could be enriched with Vitamin D by placing them in sunlight between 10am and 3pm for 30 to 60 minutes.

Cooking did not remove the nutrient and even harvested mushrooms would continue to produce it as long as they were placed in direct sunlight, according to lead author Dr Michael Holick.

He said: ‘Yes, we are talking about regular mushrooms. Just take them out of the packaging and place them in the sunshine. It doesn’t matter which way up they are, after about 30 minutes they should produce a good source of vitamin D.’

Growers in the U.S. and Australia have been using the practice for some years, but the M&S mushrooms are believed to be the first in Europe to have been produced with increased Vitamin D levels in mind.

The brand’s Active Health range already includes eggs, milk, yoghurt and cheese with added Vitamin D.

Its Brussels sprouts enriched with selenium, which helps thyroid function and could help protect against cancer, will go on sale on October 17.
