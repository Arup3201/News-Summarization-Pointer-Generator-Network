American plans for military strikes on Syria were in disarray last night after Russia seized on a blunder from US Secretary of State John Kerry.

Mr Kerry suggested the Syrian tyrant could prevent international military action against his country by giving up his chemical weapons arsenal.

He caused further confusion in Washington by promising any missile strikes that may take place would be ‘unbelievably small’.

Russia seized on the off-the-cuff 
remarks, offering to start work ‘immediately’ to put Assad’s poison gas 
stocks under ‘international control’.

The plan was also welcomed by UN  Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon.

Last
night the US government said it would take a ‘hard look’ at the Russian
proposal but had ‘serious scepticism’ about putting Syria’s chemical 
weapons under international protection.

But diplomatic sources said there had been no discussion at last week’s G20 summit of such a plan.

One
said Mr Kerry’s intervention, made as he concluded a tour of Western 
nations, risked complicating a crunch vote in the US Senate over whether
to back Barack Obama’s plans to use force against Syria.

The Senate will vote tomorrow, the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on New York.

However,
if President Obama fears losing the vote, some suspect he may yet use 
Mr Kerry’s intervention as a device to delay.

Talks: Russia offered to start work 'immediately' to put Assad's poison gas stocks under 'international control' after Kerry's comments

The idea President Assad 
could hand over his weapons began as a flippant remark by Mr Kerry 
yesterday morning in London after talks with Foreign Secretary William 
Hague.

The White House refused to say whether they agreed the line with 
the secretary of state but one administration official told CNN it was 
‘a major goof’.

Asked what 
President Assad could do to avoid military action, Mr Kerry said: ‘He 
can turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the 
international community in the next week.’

He hastily added: ‘He isn’t about to do it and it can’t be done, obviously.’

Seeking
to assuage critics of military intervention, the US Secretary of State 
insisted: ‘We are not talking about war. We are not going to war.

'We 
will be able to hold Bashar Assad accountable without engaging in troops
on the ground or any prolonged kind of effort in a very limited, very 
targeted, very short-term effort.’

Within
hours, Russia seized on the idea. The country’s foreign minister Sergei
Lavrov, following talks in Moscow with his Syrian counterpart Walid 
al-Moallem, said: ‘If the establishment of international control over 
chemical weapons in that country would allow avoiding strikes, we will 
immediately start working with Damascus.

‘We
are calling on the Syrian leadership to not only agree on placing 
chemical weapons storage sites under international control, but also on 
its subsequent destruction and fully joining the treaty on prohibition 
of chemical weapons.’

Mr 
al-Moallem said that Syria ‘welcomes Russia’s initiative, based on the 
Syrian’s government care about the lives of our people and security of 
our country’.

Asked in the 
Commons about Moscow’s proposals, Mr Cameron said: ‘If that were to be 
the case, it would be hugely welcome. I think we have to be careful 
though to make sure this is not a distraction tactic to discuss 
something else rather than the problem on the table.’

Former
Republican presidential candidate John McCain, whose support for 
military action appeared to have been won by President Obama, said the 
suggestion strikes would be ‘unbelievably small’ was ‘unbelievably 
unhelpful’.

Speaking to CBS,
Assad warned that if Mr Obama decides to launch military strikes, the 
US and its allies that, in retaliation: ‘You should expect everything. 
Not necessarily from the government.’

Diplomatic
sources said Syria had always refused to sign up to anti-chemical 
weapons treaties and did not even acknowledge the existence of its 
stockpiles, meaning the chances of meaningful progress were negligible. 
They also poured scorn on the idea that Russia could be trusted to act 
as an honest broker in any deal.

Defiant: Bashar al Assad said he was ready for an American-led military strike and expected that 'repercussions' would follow for the U.S, during an interview on CBS

He replied: 'He can turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week.'

He added: 'He isn't about to do it and it can't be done, obviously.'

Mr Kerry used the opportunity to redouble his attacks on Assad, saying that the Syrian president's credibility was in question.

'He sends SCUD missiles into schools,' he said '(Washington) knows where the rockets came from and where they landed ... and it was no 
accident that they all came from regime -controlled territory and all 
landed (in opposition-held territory)'

In an interview on CBS's This Morning,
Assad argued that the evidence Mr Kerry has disclosed about chemical 
weapons use amounts to a 'big lie' that resembled the case for war in 
Iraq the U.S. made to the United Nations over a decade ago.

Asked to respond, Mr Kerry said he 
would be confident to take evidence that the US intelligence committee 
has gathered into any court.

'What does he offer?' Mr Kerry asked. 'Words that are contradicted by fact.'

The White House has led international
calls for the pressing need to prevent further atrocities after 
harrowing video emerged of an alleged chemical weapons attack which 
killed nearly 1,400 people.

However, America has appeared 
increasingly
isolated after Prime Minister David Cameron was defeat in the House of 
Commons on a plan for UK involvement in military strikes on the al-Assad
regime - blamed for deploying the banned munitions against its own 
people.
