One man who walked inside said he was cuffed to a bench for 17 hours. Another was only found after he was transferred to the hospital with a head injury. A third ended up dead. 

What did all three men have in common? They had been taken to Homan Square.

Operated by the Chicago police, Homan Square is an unmarked warehouse on the West Side where local attorneys and a protester claim Chicago police are operating a CIA-style 'black site.'

Operated by the Chicago police, Homan Square is an unmarked warehouse on the West Side where local attorneys and a protester claim Americans have been shackled for hours and denied basic rights 

In a story by the Guardian, Brian Jacob Church said it took his lawyers  hours to locate him in what he called a 'domestic black site'.

'It brings to mind the interrogation facilities they use in the Middle East,' he said. 'When you go in, no one knows what's happened to you.' 

Church was brought to Homan Square in 2012 with 11 other people after protesting the NATO summit and said he was denied his right to call a lawyer, was not read his Miranda rights and had to sit in a windowless cell. 

He said for 17 hours his ankles were shackled together and one wrist was cuffed to a bar behind a bench.  

Church, a member of the NATO 3 who was eventually incarcerated for two and a half years before he was found not guilty of terrorism-related charges, said he figured he'd never see 'the light of day again'. 

Sarah Gelsomino, Church's lawyer, said she searched for her client, whose name wasn't on any jail booking records, for 12 hours before she learned Homan Square even existed.

When Church was finally able to talk to an attorney, he claimed they spoke through a 'floor-to-ceiling chain-link metal cage'. 

Almost a full day had past before Church was booked at a nearby police station.

One Chicago lawyer called Homan Square an 'open secret'. 

'If you can't find a client in the system, odds are they're there,' Julia Bartmes told the Guardian. 

Another attorney, Anthony Hill, said people who are taken to Homan Square 'just disappear' until they are either charged or released.

Hill said police use the warehouse as an 'off the books' interrogation space when they want information about the flow of money, guns and drugs on the streets.   

Eliza Solowiej, of Chicago's First Defense Legal Aid, said she couldn't find one man for 'six to eight hours', last seeing him in a police station before he was transferred to Homan Square.

She said later that day the man, who asked to remain anonymous and whose lawyer declined to confirm Solowiej's account, sent  a  picture to her phone showing he had received head injuries.

Solowiej didn't find him until after he was taken to the hospital. 

John Hubbard was another man taken to Homan Square, but he did not make it out alive. 

A Chicago Tribune story reported he was pronounced dead after being found 'unresponsive in an interview room'. A medical examiner told the Guardian that, after publication, it was determined he died of a heroin overdose.

Three attorneys recounted to the Guardian incidents in which they were denied access to their clients at Homan Square. 

Bartmes said she was once refused entry into the warehouse when she went to check on a 15-year-old boy who had been taken there hours ago.

She said the boy was eventually returned home, with no charges, after 'maybe 13 hours in custody'.   

The Chicago police department has responded to the Guardian's story, claiming that Homan Square is just like any other police facility in the city.

Police spokesman Marty Maloney said: 'If lawyers have a client detained at Homan Square, just like any other facility, they are allowed to speak and visit to them.'

'There are always records of anyone who is arrested by CPD, and this is not any different at Homan Square.'

The statement added that the facility is not a secret and that the public can access its Evidence Recovered Property Section to claim inventoried property, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. 

Maloney also said the Guardian's report of physical violence at the warehouse 'is unequivocally false, is offensive, and it is not supported by any facts whatsoever'.
