A 23-year-old Lafayette College senior has become the latest arrest in a Philadelphia drug ring after he turned himself in to cops on Tuesday.

Christian 'Stocky' Euler, a star lacrosse player who had previously attended the exclusive Haverford School with other suspects in the ring, turned himself into Lower Merion police and is in jail following his arraignment, NBC reported.

He is just one of the nine suspects arrested for allegedly selling marijuana, cocaine and ecstasy to students at private high schools and colleges in the area.

Two graduates of Haverford School, Neil Scott, 25, and Timothy Brooks, 18, are accused of being the ring leaders of the operation, which they called the 'Main Line Take Over Project'.

Authorities confiscated drugs, guns and piles of cash in a sweep related to the operation, which officials believe had been running for at least a couple of months, officials said.

On Tuesday, it emerged that Scott had returned to the area after breaking up with an older girlfriend in California, while Brooks had moved back home after suffering a sports-related injury at college.

Both had once played lacrosse for The 
Haverford School, a $35,000-a-year prep school where they allegedly went
 on to supply drugs.

Scott 
graduated in 2008 and went to Connecticut College, but he dropped out 
after three semesters after he was caught smoking pot and making fake 
IDs, the Philadelphia Daily News reported.

Afterwards,
 one of his high school coaches found him a job working for a team in 
California, and when that folded in February 2013, another coach in the 
state gave him a job on his program.

'He told me there was nothing good at 
home,' the coach, Zack Burke, told the Daily News. 'Nothing but drugs and trouble, and he wanted to get 
away from it out here.'

But Burke said that Scott's attitude 
began to change. He added that 
he thought Scott began dating a 40-year-old dermatologist who could provide him Xanax and other pills.

'I feel like she made him crazy,' he said. 'I heard he packed up his car and went back to Philly in September.'

Likewise,
 Brooks headed back to Philadelphia for surgery after suffering a sports
 injury after one semester - and he met with Brooks, a fellow Haverford 
grad who he knew through lacrosse circles.

The pair allegedly bought books about street-smart drug dealers to learn the business.

Prosecutors say they then hired 
students to peddle the drugs at Lafayette, Gettysburg and Haverford 
colleges, and at several suburban high schools.

Wanted: Timothy Brooks is led into Montgomery County Magisterial District Court. Prosecutors identified Brooks as one of the leaders of a drug ring they say supplied marijuana and cocaine to colleges and schools

Partner in crime: Neil K. Scott covers his face as he is led into court. He was one of the leaders of a drug ring. Scott and the other suspect, Timothy Brooks, were both graduates of The Haverford School

The two named their network 'The Main Line Takeover Project,' investigators said.

'Their
 intention, as the name suggests, was the two of them would take over 
drug distribution - in particular, marijuana distribution - in schools 
and colleges on the Main Line,' District Attorney Risa Vetri Ferman 
said.

'This was not a game. 
These people were in business, they were in business to make money and 
they were going to do whatever they needed to do so that no one 
threatened their business.'

Scott would receive bulk shipments from a California supplier which would be shipped to his Haverford apartment, which allegedly served as his base of operations.

Ferman said local students would be drafted into the drug distribution operation as sub-dealers to allegedly distribute cocaine, marijuana, hash oil and ecstasy.

'The high school sub-dealers were encouraged to develop their business so they could sell at least one pound of marijuana each week,' Ferman said.

Haul: Drugs, money and guns were seized when Lower Merion Police broke up a drug distribution ring that supplied marijuana and cocaine a number of high schools in Philadelphia's affluent Main Line suburbs

Brooks - who Ferman said acted as the supervisor of the student dealers - instructed them to make sure there was 'never a drought,' Ferman said. He wanted dealers to make certain there was always a constant supply in the assigned schools.

If the dealers met their weekly quota, the incentives included a lower purchase price for marijuana in order to increase their profit margin.

Ferman said investigators learned about the 'Main Line Take Over Project' through confidential informants and conducted a one-day round-up in February.

In that operation, prosecutors said they confiscated 8 lbs. of marijuana, 3 grams of hash oil, 23 grams of cocaine, 11 grams of Ecstasy, $11,000 in cash, a loaded handgun, an AR-15 assault rifle and AR-15 style rifle.

Most of the contraband came from Scott's Haverford apartment, authorities said.

Questions: As well as the two ringleaders, Garrett Johnson, 18, (left) and Daniel Mcgrath, 18, (right) were arrested in the investigation. They are both students at Scott and Brooks' former prep school

'Sub-dealers': Willow Orr, (left), and Domenic Curcio, 29 (right) were also arrested in connection with the ring

'Involved': Reid Cohen, 18, (left) a high school student, and John Rosemann, 20, (right) a Lafayette student

Investigators found approximately 
eight pounds of marijuana, three pounds of hash oil, 23 grams of 
cocaine, 11 grams of ecstasy, $11,000 in cash, a loaded AR-15 assault 
rifle, a loaded 9mm pistol, and a loaded .22 AR-15 style rifle along 
with ammunition for all of those guns.

During
 the four-month investigation, text messages revealed Scott gave Brooks 
advice on how to expand the marijuana sales in high schools, 
investigators say. Brooks then supervised sub-dealers who sold marijuana
 at local high schools.

Brooks
 and Scott are former graduates of The Haverford School. They also 
played lacrosse at a Montgomery County private school and coached youth 
sports leagues.

Ferman says the two men exploited those relationships to help build their drug operation.

Scott,
 who is being held on $1 million bail, covered his face and shouted 
expletives at reporters attempting to get comment following his 
arraignment on Monday afternoon. His attorney declined comment saying he
 had just gotten the case.

Good upbringing: Both Scott and Brooks the posh attended Haverford College. A private, nonsectarian, preparatory boys' school outside Philadelphia

Caught in the act: Lafayette College another of the private coeducational liberal arts and engineering schools whose name has now been tarnished by the alleged drug ring

Brooks' parents posted the $25,000 bail to release him from jail.

Brooks' attorney, Greg Pagano, says Brooks 'regrettably lost his way' and is remorseful.

In addition to Scott and Brooks, seven alleged 'sub-dealers' were also charged. They are: Daniel McGrath, 18, a student at The Haverford School; John Rosemann, 20, a student at Lafayette College; Christian Euler, 23, a graduate of The Haverford School and student at Lafayette College; Garrett Johnson, 18, a student at Haverford College; Reid Cohen, 18, a Haverford College student; Willow Orr, 22; Domenic Curcio, 29.

Two juveniles, a 17-year-old Radnor High School student and 17-year-old Lower Merion High School student, have also been petitioned by the DA's office.
