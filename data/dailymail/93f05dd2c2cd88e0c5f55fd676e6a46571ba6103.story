With England looking for a late equaliser against the Italians, Wayne Rooney stepped up to take a corner won as Leighton Baines’ freekick was saved.

Rooney, who often takes corners for Manchester United and England with some success, strode forward, taking three steps before striking the ball.

But with his right boot he fired the dead ball opportunity into the Manaus sky and out for a goalkick without any other player getting close to touching the ball.

England’s players simply bowed their heads and turned to jog back to the half-way line, perhaps embarrassed at their frontman’s dead ball prowess compared to Italy’s midfield maestro Andrea Pirlo.

Was Rooney’s effort the worst corner ever?

As Liverpool’s title challenge fell apart against Chelsea at Anfield, Aspas’ stoppage time short corner only succeeded in finding Willian on the edge of the box.

The Brazilian, fresh off the bench, burst away upfield and the move eventually led to Chelsea’s second goal which handed Manchester City the title initiative and deflated Liverpool.

While Rooney’s corner kick was perhaps more embarrassing, England fans should perhaps at least be grateful that it didn’t lead to a goal to kill off their Group D opener.
