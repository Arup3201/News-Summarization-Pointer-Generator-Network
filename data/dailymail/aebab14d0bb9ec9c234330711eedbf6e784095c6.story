The fisherman who survived 12 days adrift off the coast of Hawaii is set to be reunited with his long lost son, who he lost contact with two decades ago.

Ron Ingraham, 67, was weak, dehydrated and hungry - but otherwise healthy - after surviving by eating raw fish when his boat was blown off course on Thanksgiving Day.

He was found by a US navy destroyer 64 miles out to sea - nine days after the US Coast Guard called off the search for him following an operation that covered 12,000 square miles of ocean.

But the harrowing ordeal has provided an unexpected opportunity for Mr Ingraham to get back in contact with the son who he last spoke to in the 1990s.

Zakary Ingraham, who now lives in St. Joseph, Missouri, says he is trying to get out to Hawaii to see his father, who arrived on the island of Molokai on Wednesday.

'When I see my dad, I'm going to give him a big hug,' he said. 'I'm going to do everything I can to get out there as soon as possible.'

The first Zakary, who grew up in Hawaii, heard of his father's disappearance was when the Coast Guard called him as Mr Ingraham's next of kin to say that they were calling off the search.

'It's tough to put into words,' he said. 'You're crushed, and you don't know what to do.

'And of course, I'm in Missouri so that made it feel worse I couldn't go out and look for him. It was horrible.

He added: 'I held on to hope. I knew my dad was tough. So I didn't feel like he was gone.' 

But as the days wore on, full-time student Zakary, 43, resigned himself to accepting his dad was not coming back - until he got a call on Tuesday to say that his father was found.

Ron Ingraham, 67, was rescued on Tuesday morning after 12 days lost at sea. His friends and family had planned a funeral service for Saturday

'At first it didn't register,' he said. 'They said, 'He's alive,''

'You might as well be on a Broadway show jumping up and clicking your heels, I was so happy.'

While his father was missing, Zakary tried to learn more about him. He said he reached a fellow Molokai fisherman who told him his dad had set out for the island of Lanai, where he planned to sell his fish. 

'I always wanted to find him and get in touch with him,' Zakary said, adding how difficult it had been as his fisherman father did not have a cellphone and could not be contact on social media. 

The fisherman had reemerged with an eight-second distress call on Tuesday morning: 'We got a mayday here. Mayday. This is the Malia. Anybody picking this up?'

Mr Ingraham told ABC News that he ran into trouble after his radio was destroyed when a rogue wave slammed into his boat, knocking him into the sea, but in the end he survived by eating raw fish.

'I'm a fisherman so I caught fish; it wasn't as good as a sushi bar, but that's how I hydrated,' he said. 

A Coast Guard cutter towed his crippled 25-foot sailboat, the Malia, back to its port in Kaunakakai.

Mr Ingraham celebrated on land with a cigarette with his friend Dedric Manaba. Mr Manaba's wife told the Los Angeles Times that despite his ordeal Mr Ingraham looked well when he arrived at the shore on Wednesday.

'He is a man of very few words,' she said. 'He hugged everyone and thanked everyone and just kept on walking.'  

'We are happy that he was found. We are very excited that we are able to provide some positive closure,' Coast Guard spokesman Lt. Scott Carr told the Los Angeles Times. 'It was a really tough decision to suspend the search.'

Mr Ingraham, an experienced fisherman, was sailing alone from Kaunakakai Harbor to Manele Bay on Lanai on November 27, Thanksgiving Day - a journey that should have put him no more than five miles from land at any time.

But something went horribly wrong. On the day he left, he sent out two distress signals that his boat was taking on water. The Coast Guard pinpointed his message as coming 46 miles west of Kailua-Kona - dramatically off his course. 

The Coast Guard mounted a massive search effort - flying 59 airborne missions with MH-65 Dolphin helicopter crews and HC-130 Hercules airplane crews. However, the distress signal went dark and planes and helicopters found no signs of Ingraham's boat.

Mr Ingraham sent a distress call far off course - and was found 80 miles from his original mayday signal

On December 1, Coast Guard commanders called off the search effort after failing to find Ingraham. 

Then, nine days later, he resurfaced with a  mayday call. A Coast Guard post picked up the distress signal and pinpointed it 64 miles south of Oahu - or about 80 miles from his first distress call.

A Navy destroyer, the USS Paul Hamilton was nearby and rushed to Mr Ingraham's aid. 

Both his main masts had snapped and the outboard motor was mangled. He was sailing under the power of a tiny auxiliary sail, attempting to make it back to land.   

'I thought, well at least dad died doing what he loved,' Zakary said. 'I was trying to emotionally quell myself. But at the same time, I kind of had that feeling he wasn't gone yet.' 

Now the memorial service that had been planned in Kaunakakai to mourn Ingraham's death has been revised. It's not a welcome home party. 

'We're going to turn it into a celebration instead of a funeral,' his friend Chris Connor told KITV.
