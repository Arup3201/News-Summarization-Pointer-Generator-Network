A young motorist who boasted on Twitter about knocking a cyclist off his bike yesterday said the  message was the biggest regret of her life.

Emma Way, 22, was found guilty at Norwich Magistrates Court of failing to stop after a collision and failing to report an accident. She was fined and given seven points on her licence.

The former trainee accountant was driving round a bend on a narrow country lane in Norfolk when she collided with a cyclist who was just two miles from the end of a 100-mile ride.

his bike earlier'. Toby Hockley (right), 29, came forward as the 
cyclist involved in the collision and said he was 'lucky to be alive' 
following the crash

Hours after the accident she tweeted: 
‘Definitely knocked a cyclist off earlier – I have right of way he 
doesn’t even pay road tax! #bloodycyclists.’

Yesterday
Way said she wrote the message on the ‘spur of the moment’. ‘It was 
ridiculous and stupid and I apologise to all cyclists,’ she said. ‘It is
the biggest regret of my life so far.’

Way
was on her way to see her mother at around 2pm on May 19 when she 
clipped cyclist Toby Hockley in her Ford Ka near the village of Rockland
All Saints.

Mr Hockley, 29,
suffered bruising and minor damage to his bike. The life-long cyclist –
who covers about 4,500 miles a year – said that he had been riding 
behind his friend Jason Sexton at the time.

‘A car came around the corner, narrowly missing Jay,’ he said.

‘The
car was heading over to my side of the road. I was hit on the leg by 
the wing and on the arm by the wing mirror and tried to slam on my 
brakes to regain control.’

He said there was a loud crunch as he was knocked into a hedge.

Way told magistrates she had lived near the road for 20 years and had cycled along it as a child.

Claiming
the collision was Mr Hockley’s fault, she said she  had been driving at
just 15mph and her road positioning was as far  to the nearside as 
possible. She added: ‘Afterwards I looked in my mirror. I did not think 
he was injured – if I did I would definitely have stopped.’

Way described the post as 'my biggest regret' as she was convicted

She
told the court that she had  lost her job with Norwich-based 
accountancy firm Larking Gowen as a result of the tweet.

After  she 
sent the message it was re-tweeted by scores of furious cyclists all 
around the country, including some who reported her to police and 
complained to her employer.

Asked
by her lawyer how she would rank the tweet on the ‘score of one to ten 
for stupidity’, she said: ‘I would score it at 11.’

Confession: This tweet by user Emma Way was met with shock and prompted an investigation by Norfolk police

Magistrate
Martin Cliffe fined her £337 and ordered her to pay £300 in costs, also
adding seven penalty points to her licence.

She was cleared of a third 
charge of driving without due care and attention.

Superintendent
Dave Marshall, Norwich police district commander, said: ‘Miss Way’s 
online comments did not represent responsible  driving behaviour.’

Way refused to comment as she left court. Since the incident she has cancelled her Twitter account.
