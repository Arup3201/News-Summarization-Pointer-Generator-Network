Sabrina Cammock, from Queens, New York, was discovered inside a room at the Hotel Edison just after 9am on Saturday while on Spring Break.  

The 21-year-old, who was a member of the Syracuse University track and field team, was on spring break with a group of her friends.

A police source told the New York Daily News: 'They all went to sleep, and when they woke up, she didn’t wake up.'

It was also reported that no drugs were found in the room and there were no signs of trauma on her body.  

Cammock was in her senior year studying public health at Syracuse’s David B. Falk College of Sport and Human Dynamics, according to her college website.

On the track she dominated the 60-meter to 400-meter sprints and was part of a team of runners who broke her school’s 4x100-meter relay record last year.

Her cousin Kemal Brown, 34, told the Daily News: 'She’s better than anybody you know. She’s a baby and she's gone. I’ve never seen anything like this around me before.' 

Syracuse University head coach Chris Fox released a statement Saturday saying: 'Sabrina was a wonderful and remarkable person and student athlete.

'Our team and coaching staff are devastated by her loss. All of our thoughts are with Sabrina’s family and friends.'

Senior Vice President Rebecca Reed Kantrowitz emailed a statement out to all students offering them counselling in the wake of the tragic news.

It read: 'We know those in Falk College and athletics are especially affected, and our thoughts are with the students, teammates, faculty and staff who are part of these communities.'  

 An autopsy has been scheduled to find out how she died, officials said.
