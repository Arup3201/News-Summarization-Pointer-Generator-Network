A Manchester United song is amongst several famous football terrace chants that have been turned into Christmas carols for the latest BT Sport advert.

'12 Days of Cantona' can often be heard at Old Trafford at this time of year, and BT have done their best to outdo the United faithful.

Chelsea were the club lucky enough to be selected to play a part in their version of 'Jingle Bells', with the singers keen to see the Blues win away from Stamford Bridge.

Songs such as 'Where were you when you were s***' also add to the light-hearted nature of the spoof.

The 'Poznan' celebration also makes an appearance. This phenomenon was made famous after Polish outfit Lech Poznan visited Manchester City in 2013, with their fans celebrating a goal by turning their backs to pitch and jumping up and down.

Other racier numbers include 'My old man', which is also often heard around the red half of Manchester.
