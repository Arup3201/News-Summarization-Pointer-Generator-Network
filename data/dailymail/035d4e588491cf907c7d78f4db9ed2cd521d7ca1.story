The number of British and Irish holidaymakers taking cruises fell by almost 80,000 last year – the first annual drop for a decade, according to industry figures.

Cruise Lines International Association data showed bookings fell 4.8 per cent, from 1.72million to 1.64million.

Such holidays survived and even thrived during the economic downturn as a greater variety of destinations became available.

But the bubble may be bursting, with many put off by ever larger ships, having to fly abroad to the first port, and cost. Others may be deterred by health scares such as food poisoning or ebola.

The CLIA said it was the first fall in a decade with a major factor being a lack of holidays starting in Britain or Europe meaning travellers had to fly further to pick up their cruise.

That may change this year with the launch of several routes from ports like Southampton, including the massive liner Britannia christened by The Queen last week.

The fall also means Britain loses its places as Europe's biggest cruisers, overtaken by the 1.77 million Germans who took a seabound voyage last year.

Overall, the number of Europeans taking a cruise rose by 0.5 per cent to 6.39 million passengers last year said the CLIA report, so Britain's fall bucked an overall trend. 

Andy Harmer, of CLIA, told website TravelMole: 'The UK and Ireland continue to have one of Europe's highest rates of market penetration for cruise holidays.

'We're confident that the future prospects continue to be bright.'

CLIA Europe chairman Pierfrancesco Vago said the European rise was the most significant statistic. 

He said: 'This may sound like a small achievement, but if we consider the European economic climate, we can see that this is an extraordinary result, and continues our industry's trend of steady growth year-on-year.

'While Europe is struggling to recover from the economic crisis, our industry has continued to grow. We have grown by an incredible 44 per cent since 2008.'
