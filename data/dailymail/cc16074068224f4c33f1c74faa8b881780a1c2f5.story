I don't think I need to use the populist modern phrase 'spoiler alert' here when I point out that as far as the BBC telly audience is concerned, the sports personality of 2014 was Lewis Hamilton.

Although, now I mention it, I wonder if these are also the actual words that flash up on his dashboard when he has a problem with part of the bodywork on his Mercedes? But I digress.

Because the point is, as far as the people who perhaps favour ITV are concerned, their man who wears the crown of the top sport celebrity of this year is in fact a former Superbike racer from Lancashire.

Carl Fogarty was the king of the jungle on I'm A Celebrity, which came as a bit of a surprise to many. Not least of which, Foggy himself .

And no doubt a few TV channels and production companies have Jimmy Bullard lined up to be the next Phil Tuffnell. Foggy, in fact, expressed his incredulity with a rather colourful speech at the British Comedy Awards. Especially, as he pointed out, he'd managed to get through an entire title-laden career without anyone noticing. 

And it is true that as far as high profile telly is concerned, four wheels are most definitely better than two. But it wasn't always necessarily that way. As the first man profiled in the new series of Racing Legends on BBC2 on Sunday evening, proved.

Indeed, of the six legends featured in the programmes, Barry Sheene is the only man who did it with the engine clamped between his thighs. For this episode, Jim Moir aka Vic Reeves does the honours as the celebrity host charged with bringing his hero back to life. Reeves has a great track record profiling the likes of pirates and murderers in documentaries, but sportsmen has never really seemed part of his brief. But this is what Sheene was all about; exceeding his sporting boundaries.

Or as Jim puts it so eloquently himself, Barry was a '200 miles per hour pop star'. Obviously with a man like Moir at the helm, this was never going to be a story told through a furrow-browed stare.

But to think he wasn't taking it seriously would be to underestimate Jim's commitment to the Sheene cause. Which, as we discover, goes all the way back to his teen years when he, with his dad who had raced Nortons in the Fifties, first saw the youthful Sheene in action at Oliver's Mount, near the Moir's home in Scarborough.

And Oliver's Mount is where the programme culminates, with our slightly nervous, but excited host taking Sheene's famous championship-winning bike for its first spin since 1977. In between that, though, is a mixture of interviews and excellent archive material that reminded us of just what impact Sheene had, in particular during his championship years in the mid-seventies. 

By then he had his long-time partner Stephanie McLean as part of his team. And Suzy Perry here perfectly describes this handsome couple as 'the first Posh and Becks - they epitomized the decade'. Jim chats convivially with Stephanie in the film. As he also does with Barry's sister Maggie, former fellow rider Steve Parrish and mechanic Martyn Ogborne.

And they all freely give a personal in sight into a man who they all knew believed in his talent, worked at it with a sense of destiny and would enlist any one or do anything to realise it. 'He was incredibly demanding. Incredibly selfish. Some days I hated him,' recalls Ogborne of the man for whom he built the machine that Jim says 'was born out of obsession'. 

Sheene was a world champion and raced for almost 20 years before retiring in 1984

But Ogborne also freely admits it couldn't have been, and he wouldn't have had it, any other way. A point perfectly reiterated by his then nemesis on the track, the great Kenny Roberts. 'I got up every day to beat Barry Sheene,' he tells us. And clearly it was a rivalry that was fuelled by both an unswerving will to win and total, mutual respect.

The footage of Roberts and Sheene going at it is epic. Just as the shots of him crashing and recuperating are shocking and compelling. But equally as revealing are the home movie images of this good-looking young fella who liked playing to the camera - from a schoolboy with his family to the teenaged novice with an impressive Mod haircut and his first Bultaco racing bike. 

Something that Jim also got to ride and which he describes as 'a thing of charm and beauty' that also happens to send 'vibrations up through your hands and into your mind'. But the main event was Moir on Sheene's Suzuki RG back at Oliver's Mount. A challenge that he not only took on in Barry's colours, but also with Barry's son Freddie looking on and seeing the bike working for the first time ever. Moir's face when he completed his lap told the story in itself. It summed up perfectly what Barry Sheene had meant to him back in his youth, and the champion's hay day. 

Earlier on in the documentary Moir describes Sheene as someone who was 'in his sister's mags (and) on his mum and dad's chat shows'. Which sums up perfectly just what an impact this brilliant, maverick rider had back then. Sports Personality and I'm A Celebrity all rolled into one.
