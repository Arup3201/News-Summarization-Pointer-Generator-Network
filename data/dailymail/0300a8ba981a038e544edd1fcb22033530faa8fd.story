'Drink driving': Guy Pelly, pictured today outside court, denied driving his black Audi TT while over the legal limit

A close friend of Prince William has claimed a drink driving charge against him could be invalid because of malfunctions in a police breathalyser machine.

Guy Pelly, 32, was pulled over in his £90,000 black Audio R8 last year, and tests found that he was significantly over the legal alcohol limit.

He is currently standing trial in Westminster Magistrates' Court, which heard today that a reading showed the proportion of alcohol in Mr Pelly's 
breath was 52 microgrammes in 100 millilitres of breath.

The legal limit is 35.

But, despite the reading, and the testimony of officers who say his breath smelled of strong liquor on the night, Mr Pelly's lawyer has argued that the reading could have been wrong.

He said that signals given off by radios held by nearby police officers, as well as those produced by Pelly's own iPhone, could have interfered with the intoximeter machine used in the police station.

However, he was later contradicted by experts, and told the machine had been recently serviced.

Pelly had that night refused to give a breath sample at the side of the road after being pulled over near Tonteria, the Sloane Square night club he runs.

He was instead arrested and taken to a police station in Belgravia instead to undergo the test.

Giving evidence, PC Geoff Parker told the court he stopped Pelly at around 1am on May 28 last year.

He said: I noticed a black Audi pull out of a side road and travel down Sloane Street towards Knightsbridge.

'The reason my attention was drawn to the vehicle was because in my opinion it seemed to accelerate at speed.

'I decided to turn around and stop the vehicle and speak to the driver.'

'As I was speaking to him I could smell intoxicating liquor on the male's breath.

'I made a request for Mr Pelly to take part in a roadside breath test. I showed Mr Pelly the device, Mr Pelly said "I don't want to".

'I said to My Pelly "If you fail to provide a sample you'll be arrested, are you refusing to provide a sample?"

'Mr Pelly replied: "Yes".'

'I asked: "Have you had an alcoholic drink in the last 20 minutes?"

'He replied no.

'I asked: "Have you had a cigarette in the last five minutes?"

'He replied no'.

'When I asked him to take the roadside breath test he replied: "I don't want to".

Pelly was taken to Belgravia Police Station where he gave a sample over the legal drink drive limit, around an hour after his arrest.

He insists he only drank two bottles of beer that night.

Phillip Lucas, defending, said that Pelly could be innocent despite the reading, as the breathalyser machine could have suffered errors in the recording that went unseen by officers.

He told the court: 'I'm going to suggest to you that there are certain error messages that can be produced on this device that only come up on the screen.

'They will not come up on a print out. Is that news to you?'

Jon Fairhurst, the custody sergeant who oversaw the two intoximeter tests, said 'yes', adding: 'I would only be guided by the print out. As the print out said no errors, I took that to mean no errors.'

Sgt Fairhurst said he only knew of four error messages that suggested the breathalyser machine may have given a faulty reading.

But Mr Lucas said there were 13 - some of which only show up on the machine's screen and are not contained in a printout.

The officer said he knew 'how to log into it, work it and be guided by it' but he said he was 'no expert' on the number of error messages that exist.

Mr Lucas also suggested that police radios and mobile phones were in use near the machine and may have interfered with the reading.

He told the arresting officer PC Geoff Parker: 'I'm going to suggest that your police radio was on your person and switched on.'

But the officer insisted it wasn't, and told the court: 'My radio and phone are normally taken off me and placed on the custody desk before I approach the procedure.

'I removed them myself. I placed them on the desk myself.'

He admitted that there were other police officers in the adjacent custody room who would have had their radios on, but said he wasn't sure what frequency they were tuned into.

Mr Lucas also claimed that Pelly still had his iPhone in his pocket when the test was carried out.

He said: 'His telephone wasn't taken from him. When he came back to the desk he had to surrender his telephone.

'I'm suggesting that the defendant had his mobile phone on him during the procedure.'

But the officer insisted the 
socialite had been searched, his pockets emptied and his mobile phone 
removed when he first got to Belgravia police station and before he was 
breathalysed.

The coutr 
also heard how the machine was serviced and found to be in working order
 on March 4 2013 - just two and a half months before Pelly used it.

But Phillip Lucas, defending, said he was 'challenging the reliability' of the device.

He said he had no actual evidence to prove that the machine was working perfectly.

He said: 'The furthest I can go is to accept that the engineer went to check the calibration and the device. But I have no actual documentation saying it was fully operational. I don't have any actual figures about how the machine was seen on that date.'

Pressed by District Judge John Zani on what the thrust of the defence case is, he added: 'I'm challenging the reliability of the breath analysis on this occasion. That has always been our challenge.'

Charlotte Dale, an independent forensic alcohol consultant called by the prosecution, said there was no reason to doubt the machine's findings - especially as a repeat reading had been taken.

Branding the idea that it had misread Pelly's alcohol levels twice as 'too incredible'.

She said: 'For it to affect two independent specimens to the exact same extent is to be too incredible.

'They are completely independent because they are two separate breath specimens.

'These are two separate breath specimens being analysed by the same hardware and coming up with the same result.'

CCTV
 footage played to the court shows Pelly being taken the station where 
he blew into an intoxicator machine, which measured the amount of 
alcohol in his system.

He sat 
on a bench with his arms crossed after taking the test before being told
 to removed the laces from his shoes as he was put into a cell.

The
 32-year-old denies the allegation.

Pelly owns Mexican-themed Tonteria in Sloane Square and has run celebrity hotspots Mahiki and Whisky Mist in the past.

His grandmother, Monica, was a 
member of the Tate & Lyle sugar dynasty and his friendship with 
Harry stems from their participation in the Duke of Beaufort's Hunt - 
one of the oldest fox hunting packs in England.

He also organised Prince William's stag party in Devon three years ago.

Pelly, of Pimlico, southwest London, denies driving a motor vehicle when his alcohol level was above the limit.

The trial continues.
