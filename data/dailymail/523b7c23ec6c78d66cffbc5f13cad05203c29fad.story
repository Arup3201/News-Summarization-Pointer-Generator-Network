Taxpayers were forced to pay out more than £2.5m in overtime wages in just a month to clear the runaway backlog of passport applications, new figures show.

The Passport Office paid £6.75 million to staff for working extra hours during July, August and September as they attempted to a clear a backlog of thousands of applications.

Extra staff were drafted in  and working hours were extended over seven days a week as the backlog of applications soared to more than 500,0000.  

Pictures leaked to MailOnline, showing hundreds of boxes of applications piled on the floor of a Passport Office in Liverpool, piled pressure on the Government to introduce emergency measures to tackle the backlog

Immigration minister James Brokenshire revealed overtime costs were £2m in July, £2.5m in August and £2.1m in September

The Passport Office's overtime costs were £2.065 million in July, £2.53 million in August and £2.14 million in September, according to immigration minister James Brokenshire.

Previously released figures show overtime payments stood at £964,742 in May and £3.19 million for the first five months of 2014 compared with £1.5 million in the same period last year.

Home Secretary Theresa May was forced to issue an apology to people whose travel plans had been disrupted by the delays, while measures were brought in to try to fast-track applications.

A total of 226 staff were temporarily transferred from the Home Office to the Passport Office between June and August, Mr Brokenshire added. The backlog of applications in progress spiralled to 550,000.

Mrs May announced last month that HMPO was to be brought back into the Home Office and be directly accountable to ministers.

In response to a written parliamentary question from shadow immigration minister David Hanson, Mr Brokenshire said: ‘Overtime costs incurred by HM Passport Office were as follows: July £2,065,021, August £2,537,957, September £2,148,872.’

The summer holiday application backlog sparked long queues of people outside the passport offices

Passport Office Chief Executive Paul Pugh was grilled by MPs over his organisation's failure to get a grip on the backlog and was later forced from office

Labour frontbencher Mr Hanson accused Mrs May of wasting millions of pounds of taxpayers' cash.

He said: ‘These figures show just how much Theresa May's mismanagement is costing the taxpayer - it's a sign of the complete failure of leadership that she's cut staff only to then spend nearly £7 million on overtime.

‘It was the Home Secretary who made the decision to cut staff and let the crisis in the Passport Office happen, and it's the Home Secretary's decision to keep on wasting millions of pounds of taxpayers' money on overtime to cope with it.

‘Staff worked hard to deal with the backlog created by ministers' poor decisions, but the staff cuts they've had to endure have meant they've had no option but to use overtime.

‘A properly managed passport service wouldn't need the constant overtime that this Government continues to rely on and the public will rightly be angered by this continual failure.’
