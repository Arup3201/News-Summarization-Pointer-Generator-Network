He doesn’t really have to dance a jig. A choreographer’s fee is almost certainly not included in his contract for the Glasgow Grand Prix.

And the idea of using the Commonwealth Games to reprise his double act with Usain Bolt is, as Mo Farah himself suggests, a little dated.

To be honest, the sporting public will just be happy to see Mo – our Mo – doing what he does best at Hampden.

National hero: Farah has won Olympic, European and World titles running for Team GB

That means possibly going for one of the longest standing British records in this month’s glittering Diamond League event.

And then delivering double gold at Glasgow 2014. No need for whistles, bells … or crazy celebrations.

Yet Farah, asked if he and the world’s fastest man might go for a repeat of their London 2012 smash hit, when Usain did the Mobot and Mo struck the sprinter’s famous Lightning Bolt pose, laughed as he declared: ‘Nah, it’s been done already. You’ve got to come up with something new. Maybe a Scottish dance!’

Oh Mo, don’t give the promoters any ideas. They’ll have you done up in a kilt and spearing a haggis before you can say ‘photo opportunity’.

That fact that both Bolt and Farah are now scheduled to compete at the Commonwealth Games is, of course, a boost to an athletics public about to feast on a double helping of track and field.

Embraced: Despite running for England in Glasgow, Mo will be cheered by the Scottish crowds

Farah’s appearance in a special two-mile race at the Glasgow Grand Prix, partly to help readjust to life back on the track following his short-lived excursions into marathon running, will undoubtedly be the biggest draw in a two-day festival bringing many of the world’s best to Scotland.

Might Britain’s greatest distance runner, a man who admits that world records over 5k and 10k are part of his long-term ambition, be tempted to have a crack at Steve Ovett’s British record for the rarely-run two-mile race – a record that has stood since 1978?

‘I haven’t thought too much about it but, at the same time, Steve Ovett did it pretty well,’ he said. ‘We will have a think as we get closer to it. Winning is more important.

‘It would be nice to run good times and go fast but I don’t know how close it would be to get to the world record of 12:37mins for 5k or the 10k at 26:17mins.

‘Realistically, I can get closer but it all depends on what happens after the Commonwealths, with the worlds next year and then the Olympics. You have to plan, sit down with your team and see what’s what.

‘It’s hard to say exactly where I am at the minute. The 5k I ran a few weeks ago was just to test myself. But it seems to be going in the right direction.

Champions: Farah celebrated with Usain Bolt after they each won Gold at London 2012

‘Coming off the marathon, it wasn’t easy. I came off the marathon and took a break. But it’s quite exciting, the way things are going.

‘The marathon was great fun. I wouldn’t change anything in terms of how I prepared. But it’s hard. A lot of people talk about the marathon but, unless you give it a go, you’ll never know.

‘I’m glad I gave it a go. I did everything, prepared well, but it was my first marathon. Hopefully I will improve because of the experience.

‘After the marathon, I took it all quite slowly but, when things started going the right way, I decided to do the Commonwealths. Now I’m trying to peak for the Commonwealths, that is the aim.

‘The Grand Prix will let us see what I can do, see what kind of shape I’m in. This will let me see how I’m going, then I can head into the Commonwealth Games, which will be quite exciting.

‘Any competition at this level will be hard. In the Commonwealths, it’s going to be hard because of the guys running against me.

‘But that’s what I need, to race against the Kenyans, the Ugandans … it’s tense but it should be exciting.’

Farah is still based in Oregon for the most of the year, embracing the notoriously low profile of track and field in the States – a far cry from the kind of commotion he’d cause trying to wander through the streets of his home town of London.

Still, he misses plenty about Britain, listing football, big breakfasts and cups of tea – in that order – before admitting that he’s regularly up early to watch his beloved Arsenal on TV, while he’s currently tuning into World Cup even while running on his treadmill.

As for Scotland’s national football stadium, well, he’s never even been to Hampden. Not so much as seen a picture of the new track, nor spoken to a soul who has.

World Champion: Since London Farah has added European and World double Golds to his CV

Memories of running at the Kelvin Hall in January 2012 linger still, though, with the reception he got from the crowd that day inspiring hope for more of the same this summer.

He is likely, then, to join a very select band of England superstars to have received a standing ovation at the grand old ground. Twice in the space of two weeks, too.

‘When it comes to athletics, we tend to come together as the UK,’ he said. ‘Even though I’m going to be competing for England, I think the Scottish people will still be behind me.’

That’s a pretty safe bet. Even if you don’t throw in a fling, a burl or a leading role in a 40,000-some reel.
