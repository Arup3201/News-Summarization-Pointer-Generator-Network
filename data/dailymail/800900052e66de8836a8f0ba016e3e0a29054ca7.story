Women who want to have children lack the ambition to 'go right to the top', a Ukip MEP has suggested.

Stuart Agnew was branded 'prehistoric' by critics after claiming that their desire for a baby 'gets in the way'.

In a debate in the European Parliament, Mr Agnew, who represents the Eastern region, admitted that he is not a father and blamed sexism and poor childcare for preventing mothers reaching the top.

Ukip MEP Stuart Agnew claimed women lose ambition when babies get in the way

Mr Agnew said: 'If you look at the people who get degrees more, women get them and they are getting the jobs in the work place, but for various reasons, they don't have the ambition to go right to the top because something gets in the way. It's called a baby.

'I have never had a baby, but I understand that if you do have a baby it can change your life and it changes your ambitions.

'So, the route is there. Those females who really want to get to the top do so.' He made the comments during a debate on Tuesday about gender quotas.

Godfrey Bloom resigned as a Ukip MEP after telling an audience at an event promoting women in politics that they were 'sluts'

Richard Howitt, Labour's MEP for the Eastern region, branded Mr Agnew's comments 'outrageous'.

He accused Mr Agnew of holding 'Neanderthal views about women. The comments are offensive and insulting.'

Mr Agnew's comments come just two months after Godfrey Bloom MEP resigned the Ukip whip in the European Parliament after branded women in the party 'sluts' for failing to clean behind the fridge.

Mr Bloom remains an independent MEP.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage admitted last week that his party has in the past resembled a 'rugby club on a day out'.

But he claimed that was turning around. 'In the early days, just didn't have many able women in the party, or able women who had the time to give to politics. That's changed completely and if you look at the European election list for next year, the women dominate it.' But Labour MEP Mary Honeyball condemned Agnew contested that view.

She said: 'They reveal once again UKIP's prehistoric attitudes to women. UKIP is a party with no women as elected representatives, which will be running no female candidates anywhere in the East of England next time round.

'They have consistently - in both word and deed - committed to reduce the rights of women. Godfrey Bloom really was the tip of the iceberg.

Mr Agnew defended his comments, issuing a statement saying: 'I was certainly not trying to suggest that all women who have babies don't make it to the top. Margaret Thatcher is an example that springs to mind.'
