A kitten cheated death after passers-by heard it meowing inside a battered black suitcase floating on a river.

The blue-grey tabby was soaking wet, shivering and distressed but otherwise unharmed.

He was taken to the passer-by's home until the RSPCA arrived to collect him.

Lucky to be alive: Kitten found soaking wet and shivering in suitcase floating in river

The inside of the case was described as filthy and full of excrement

The 16-week-old kitten was found in Whitworth, Lancashire.

The inside of the suitcase was described as filthy and full of excrement.

RSPCA inspector Beth Clements said: 'How anyone could want to zip up such a gorgeous little thing in a case and throw him into the water like this is beyond me.

'It must have been a terrifying ordeal and he only survived by the skin of his teeth.'

She added: 'But the kitten was lucky on two counts.

'Firstly, that the suitcase floated along the river. If it had sunk he would have died straight away.

'Secondly, that someone happened to pass that heard him meow and so able to save him and ring us for rescue.

'As it was the little thing has made a full recovery and should be ready for a happy new home very soon.'Â 

Survivor: RSPCA says kitten will recover from incident and will be ready for re-homing soon

It is thought the case was thrown into the river at 6.30am last Friday after reports from other passers-by.

The woman seen throwing the kitten in is described as being in her mid-30s with light hair and heavy build.

The kitten has been seen by a vet who said he was fit and healthy and so is being cared for in private boarding.

As long as no one comes forward to claim him, he will be ready for re-homing after a week.

Anyone with any information should call the RSPCA helpline on 0300 123 8018 and quote the reference 1230 on August 2.
