Tony Blair has warned that terrorism motivated by religious extremism is growing and the West needs a global strategy to tackle it

Tony Blair has warned that terrorism motivated by religious extremism is growing and the West needs a global strategy to tackle it.

The former prime minister said the battles of the 21st century will no longer be about extreme political ideology like the last.

Alongside security measures, including military action, the West must tackle conflicts by educating people about religious tolerance, he added.

'The fact is that, though of course there are individual grievances or reasons for the violence in each country, there is one thing self-evidently in common: the acts of terrorism are perpetrated by people motivated by an abuse of religion.

'It is a perversion of faith. But there is no doubt that those who commit the violence often do so by reference to their faith and the sectarian nature of the conflict is a sectarianism based on religion.

'There is no doubt either that this phenomenon is growing, not abating.'

He said recent terror attacks and violence, including those in Syria, Libya and Iraq as well as Nigeria, Russia, and Asia, cannot be viewed as separate acts of killing but need a global strategy.

The challenge could 'define the nature of peace and conflict'.

'The battles of this century are less likely to be the product of extreme political ideology - like those of the 20th century - but they could easily be fought around the questions of cultural or religious difference,' he added.

'The answer is to promote views that are open-minded and tolerant towards those who are different, and to fight the formal, informal and internet propagation of close-minded intolerance. In the 21st century, education is a security issue.'

He announced the creation of a new online forum and database run by his Faith Foundation in collaboration with the Harvard Divinity School, which he hopes will become the world's leading source of information and debate about religion and conflict.

British victims of the IRA are planning to sue Tony Blair for allegedly conniving with Gaddafi to block compensation over Semtex used in attacks which had been supplied by Libya.

Mr Blair has been accused of helping to broker an agreement between the former Libyan leader and President George W Bush which resulted in Libya paying £1billion in compensation to American victims of terrorism but ended compensation hopes of the British victims of IRA attacks. 

Jason McCue of McCue & Partners is representing around 200 British victims of IRA attacks carried out with Semtex supplied by Libya.

He told the Daily Telegraph: 'It's bad enough being a victim of Semtex bombs supplied by Libya for the Provisional IRA campaign. 

'[But] it's sheer horror then to be informed that the British government and Tony Blair may have connived with Gaddafi to ensure the few brave British victims that justly sued and stood up to the dictator received no compensation from the Libyans,' he said.

But a spokeswoman for Mr Blair said: 'The story is absurd and wrong. Mr Blair was not involved in the issue of compensation at all.

'He has never had anything to do with it and he has never discussed any such terms.

'The letter they cite is not evidence of involvement on this issue all it reflects is government policy of the time which was to reengage with the Libyans after they gave up their WMD programme and chose to cooperate rather than sponsor terrorism.'

A Foreign Office spokesman added: 'The Government believes compensation claims are best pursued directly with the Libyan government through private campaigns.

'The claim that Government officials took any deliberate action that denied other UK victims compensation in the 2008 settlement is wrong.'
