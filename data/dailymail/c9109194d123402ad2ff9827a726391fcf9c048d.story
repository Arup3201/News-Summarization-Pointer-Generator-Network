Veteran foreign correspondent Christiane
Amanpour is to be replaced as the host of political show This Week by the former presenter George Stephanopoulos.

Amanpour, 53, is returning to CNN, where she began her career, as an international correspondent.

Stephanopoulos, 50, will go back to presenting ABC's Sunday morning slot as well as carrying in his 
current job for Good Morning America on the same network.

On the way out: Christiane Amanpour is leaving This Week for CNN and GMA host George Stephanopoulos will step into the Sunday morning slotÂ 

However Amanpour is not entirely cutting ties with ABC. She enters an unusual 
job-sharing role where she will become ABC's global affairs anchor, 
contributing to prime-time shows on world news, while also being host of
a daily show on CNN International.

Amanpour said: 'This role is groundbreaking, bold and very different. I am thrilled and honored.'

Critics
wondered from the start whether the Iranian-born Amanpour, a seasoned 
foreign correspondent for CNN, was a good fit for a panel show dominated
by American politics. She replaced Stephanopolous as host in August 2010.

This Week hasn't budged from third place
behind NBC's Meet The Press and a resurgent Face The Nation on CBS, 
with the ABC show down 1 per cent in ratings from last year.

Amanpour's reporting connections in the Middle East served ABC News particularly well during the Arab spring, and she scored an exclusive interview with then-Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in February.

But the dawning of an American election year seemed to serve her competitors, old Washington hands Bob Schieffer at CBS and David Gregory at NBC, better.

The Sunday morning show was much stronger
in the ratings when hosted by Stephanopoulos from 2002 to 2010. 
ABC moved him to New York and Good Morning America, which has done 
well in the ratings by teaming him with Robin Roberts.

Amanpour said she was looking forward to getting back out to do more international reporting and speaking to a worldwide audience on CNN, where she worked for more than two decades.

Jim Walton, president of CNN Worldwide said: 'Christiane Amanpour has been synonymous with international reporting and with CNN for many years.

'We could not be happier that through this unique arrangement with ABC News her experience and global perspective are returning to a nightly news broadcast for our international audience.'

Amanpour will be making occasional appearances on CNN's U.S. channel, spokeswoman Christa Robinson said.

Meet the Press has averaged 2.92 million viewers every Sunday this season - down 5 per cent from last year. Face the Nation, at 2.86 million viewers, is up 6 per cent, ratings company Nielsen said. This Week has averaged 2.26 million viewers.

CBS announced at the weekend that Face the Nation would expand to one hour next spring from its current half-hour format. Both Meet the Press and This Week air for one hour.

Amanpour grew up in Iran but was educated at public school in England and later at the University of Rhode Island where she studied journalism.

She made a name for herself in her first job at CNN covering the Iraq-Iran war and later gained a reputation for being fearless when she parachuted into conflict zones during assignments in the Gulf and Bosnian Wars.

She has interviewed countless presidents and political leaders. Notably she has held an interview with Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and was the first international journalist to interview then British prime minister Tony Blair in the wake of 9/11.

Earlier this year she interviewed Muammar Gaddafi and his sons Saif al-Islam and Al-Saadi al-Gaddafi.
