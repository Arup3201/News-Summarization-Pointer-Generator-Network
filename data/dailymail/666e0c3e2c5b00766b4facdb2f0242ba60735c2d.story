They are the not-so secret escapes of amorous couples in Latin America and across Asia. Yet to some, they represent a sordid side of the hotel industry.

Love hotels, couples' hotels or 'motels' as they are known in Brazil charge by the hour, allowing guests the chance to 'relax' without the need for awkward glances over breakfast.

The phenomenon began in Japan, where there are now up to 30,000 love hotels offering at the lower end, a £10 per hour  bed and en suite bathroom,  to a bed with silk sheets, flat screen TV, adult entertainment and a bath big enough for two.

While it's standard to supply guests with a selection of whips and other sex toys, some couples' hotels cater to more niche tastes.

In Japan, where the love hotel industry now accounts for £22bn a year, couples can stay in a Star Wars themed love hotel, visit Santa in a Christmas grotto, or indulge in some doctors and nurses role play in a 'clinic' available per hour.

In Chile, there are around 500 love hotels that generate around £30m a year, many of which are themed: from  prison cells to hospitals, and are fitted with jacuzzies, lights and mirrors.

In China, love hotels were at first deemed to popularize prostitution, but their popularity is growing. Its self-proclaimed first 'adult hotel' opened in Nanning, in Guangxi Zhuang, in 2008, is furnished with a red bed with straps, an adult chair and a gym ball.
