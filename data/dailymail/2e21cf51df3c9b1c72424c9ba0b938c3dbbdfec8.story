Manchester United are set to offer a trial to Southport teenager Drew Lewis.

The 19-year-old has scored 38 goals for the Conference club's reserve side this season.

His performances have captured the attention of a number of league clubs - but United have moved to offer the youngster a trial.

Southport's Drew Lewis will be given a trial with Louis van Gaal's Manchester United 

Lewis could have the opportunity of playing at Manchester United's famous Old Trafford stadium 

The development comes after United signed Sadiq El Fitouri a contract after spotting him at local club Salford City.

And Lewis could be the next non-league player to make the massive step up to the Premier League if his trial is successful.

Southport could miss Lewis' goals as they currently languish one point above the relegation zone in the Conference.
