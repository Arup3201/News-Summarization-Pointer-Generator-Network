A United Airlines 737 plane traveling from Seattle to Houston was forced to make an emergency landing in Idaho after one of its two engines reportedly shut down.

Some 116 passengers were stranded at Pocatello Regional Airport in Idaho for nine hours after it landed at 2.50am on Tuesday.

Travelers were finally able to board a replacement plane shortly before 11am on Tuesday, a spokeswoman said.

Kristy Heinz, who serves as the Secretary
and Assistant Security Coordinator at the Idaho airport, said there were no 
injuries or accidents.

The United flight was carrying 116 passengers and six crew members at the time of the emergency landing.

Pocatello airport manager David Allen told KPVI-TV that an engine on the airplane shut down and it was the closest suitable airport to make an emergency landing.

KPVI also reported that passengers were served food and refreshments while waiting at the terminal.

United Airlines spokeswoman Jennifer Dohm said the plane was diverted to Pocatello due to 'an issue with an engine'. Maintenance workers are investigating the cause of the engine failure.

Other United Airlines planes have had technical problems this summer, according to reports.

The Houston Chronicle reported that in July, a United Airlines 777 flying from Houston to Amsterdam turned around after it experienced engine problems. United did not offer a specific explanation of the problem.

Also in July a United Airlines 757 heading from Newark to Frankfurt experienced engine failure. ABC said it had to land in Boston instead of Frankfurt.

Earlier this month, a United Airlines 747 experienced engine failure on a flight from San Francisco to Sydney.

The San Francisco Chronicle reported that one of four engines on the plane failed, causing it to turn around.
