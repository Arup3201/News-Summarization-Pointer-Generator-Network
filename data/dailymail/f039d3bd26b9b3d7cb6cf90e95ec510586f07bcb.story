British women are going nude and ditching their classic red lipsticks for softer, more muted shades. 

For the first time in three years nude lipsticks are outselling red on the High Street. Sales of sheer, natural shades are up 62 per cent at Debenhams compared to this time last year.

Lipstick sales are often seen as a broad economic indicator with sales of bright red lippy said to rise in a recession and fall during an upturn. EstÃ©e Lauder chairman, Leonard Lauder, named it the 'lipstick index' theory in 2001, although the effect was first noted in the 1930s Depression.

As economists insist we are now out of recession, recent lipstick sales figures back the theory, with a more modern look for lips the clear trend on red carpets and catwalks since the New Year.

Actresses Cate Blanchett, Julia Roberts, Amy Adams and Kate Hudson all sported nude lips at the Oscars while singers Rita Ora, Pink and Alicia Keys did it first at the Grammys.

In the past scarlet-lipped icons Marilyn Monroe, Ava Gardner and Elizabeth Taylor helped sales rocket and more recently Gwyneth Paltrow has spoken in favour of the, 'kick-ass' effect of a red lipstick.

Current best sellers at the 200 year old British retailer include; Rouge Dior Nude Lipstick in 'Trench' by Christian Dior, Clinique's Long Last 'Twilight Nude' Lipstick and Urban Decays 'Naked' Ultra Nourishing Lip-gloss, which has been a best seller since its launch last month.

'The trend for sheer, nude lips and 
more natural makeup was first highlighted on the Spring/Summer 2014 
catwalks and has been seen on countless celebrities ever since,' says 
Sara Stern, Debenhams Health & Beauty Director.

'Even
 Kim Kardashian has recently undergone a make-under, transitioning from 
bright red lipstick and heavy application, towards a softer more relaxed
 appearance I like to call naked make-up. This look creates an 
illusion of being make-up free but with full coverage, perfect for 
summer.

Rock wife and Oscar nominee Amy Adams also chose neutral shades over bright red

'There will always be a time and place 
for the classic red lipstick, but on occasion it 
can look a little outmoded. Today's trend-setters are definitely 
embracing the less-is-more concept when it comes to cosmetics and for an
 image that is bang up to date a nude lip is key.'

The red lip does go back a long way though. Ancient Egyptians made lipstick by mixing together bromine mannite, iodine and fucus-algin - a plant dye. It made a nice red, but unfortunately was also poisonous.

Elizabeth I used beeswax and plant extracts to create crimson lips, but in 1770 parliament made lipstick illegal ruling that women found guilty of 'seducing men into matrimony using cosmetic means' could be tried for witchcraft.

Queen Victoria thought lipstick vulgar, but it was popularised by silent movie actresses in the early twentieth century. The first  modern swivel lipstick tube was patented in 1923 and companies such as Chanel, Helena Rubenstein, and Max Factor soon ensured almost every woman had one in their handbag.

Now an estimated 81 per cent of women world wide wear lipstick.
