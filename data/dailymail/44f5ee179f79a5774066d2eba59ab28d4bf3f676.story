Chef  Matt Bradley lost 6st in just over a year and transformed himself into a super-trim, super-fit athlete. 

At nearly 18st and clinically obese, Matt's self esteem was at a low ebb and he hated seeing pictures of himself.

His job as a chef saw him surrounded by food and eating at least three to four times just during the working day.

Matt dropped from 18st (left) to a trim 11st (right) by changing his diet and adopting exercise 

Now the 23-year-old, from Leamington Spa in Warwickshire, is happy, healthy and has just got married.

'My wife Hannah and I both piled on weight in our late teens. We'd started earning our own money and most of it went on takeaways and nights out.

'Getting a job as a chef didn't help. I spent my days picking at food and could easily eat three or four times a day at work. I was a lot less active than I had been when I was younger, too – and it showed.

Although happily engaged to Hannah (right), Matt's weight meant his self confidence was at an all time low 

Hannah and Matt, pictured together recently, embarked on their weight loss journey together, with Hannah losing over 3st before the wedding 

Matt and Hannah were originally motivated to lose weight when they started planning their wedding

'On the one hand, I was really happy and secure with Hannah. On the other, my confidence had taken a real nosedive and I was very self-conscious about my size. I had to buy XXL clothes online and I hated seeing photographs of myself – there's a picture of me at a wedding and I swear I've got three chins.'

Around 18 months ago, Matt and Hannah began planning our their wedding and decided it was time for them both to lose weight.

But when Matt was persuaded to join a weight loss group with his fiancée, he was shocked to discover his constant snacking had caused his weight to rise into the clinically obese category- putting him at increased risk for a range of illnesses and conditions.

'Hannah suggested we join Slimming World and to say I wasn't looking forward to it is an understatement. I thought it was somewhere only women went– no place for a young bloke like me!

Matt reached his target of 11st 5lb two days before his wedding, and the couple looked stunning on the day

'Once I was eventually coaxed inside, I soon realised I'd been completely wrong. I wasn't the only man there and everyone was incredibly friendly.

'Discovering I was 17st 12lb – and clinically obese – was a proper wake-up call, so I was delighted when I lost 6lb in the first week. Especially as neither of us could believe we were still able to eat so much.' 

The couple began to totally change their lives, overhauling their diet and incorporating exercise into their routines. 

More of Matt's story appears in the new men section in the October issue of Slimming World 

'We soon got into the habit of planning our meals at the start of each week – one of my favourites is homemade burgers and chips made with low-calorie cooking spray and served with piles of fresh vegetables. We still have a night out or a takeaway once a week too.

'After I'd lost 3st, I decided to join a local gym. My first visit was like the first Slimming World experience all over again: I expected everyone there to be toned and intimidating. Instead it was really welcoming. I started running, too – walking and jogging at first, then building up gradually until recently I completed a 10km race.'

Matt found the weight dropping off quickly, despite continuing his job as a chef, and managed to lose an incredible 6st in the 18 months before his wedding.  

The biggest boost came when I went to see my GP a couple of months ago. When I walked in, he glanced from me to his computer screen and said, 'Sorry – I think I've got the wrong person. It says here you're nearly 18st'. He was really impressed by my weight loss and agreed that I could stop using my asthma inhalers.

A lot of people have commented on how hard it must have been to lose weight working as a chef. The difference is that I have the know-how to make healthier choices now. And when I check the food I'm cooking, I just taste a small spoonful rather than eating loads.

I reached my target of 11st 5lb two days before our wedding – a loss of 6st 7lb. Hannah's lost 3st 7lb, too. Even though we've always been very happy with each other, we weren't happy with ourselves. 

'Now we both have so much more energy and confidence. We're excited about starting our married life together.'

Matt's full story appears in the October 2014 issue of Slimming World magazine, which features the title's first ever men's section 'M' and is on sale now in Slimming World groups and on newsstands.
