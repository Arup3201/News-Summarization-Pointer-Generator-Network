Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has backed Emre Can to become a world class player after the Germany Under 21 international continued his impressive form against Burnley on Wednesday.

The Reds made it nine wins from 11 Premier League games as they remained on course for a top-four finish with a 2-0 win against Sean Dyche's side at Anfield.

Liverpool's resurgence in recent months has been epitomised by the performances of former Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Can, who has become a key part of the Reds' side.

Rodgers has reinvented Can as the right-sided defender in Liverpool's back three and the former Swansea boss claims that the 21-year-old will be good enough to play for any team in the world.

'If you give Emre another couple of years, he could play in any team in world football,' said the Reds boss as quoted by Liverpool Echo. 'That's how highly I rate him.

'Playing at the back he is strong, aggressive and fast. He moves the ball well and can move into midfield, and whether central or out wide you can see his intelligence.

'Emre can break through lines with his power and pace and has great composure.

'You can see from the response of the crowd that they love him. He does the dirty work as well. He doesn't just play and look nice, he presses the ball and is aggressive.

'I feel he will develop into a world-class player.'
