Department store Debenhams is teaming up with charitable organisation The House of St Barnabas to donate suits to London's homeless to help them get back to work.

The charity launched its Employment Academy last Autumn which provides training and work experience for those affected by homelessness.

Now retailer Debenhams will offer personal shopping appointments to Employment Academy participants, donating suits to each client to be worn for job interviews while they receive City & Guilds accredited hospitality training.

Ed Watson, PR director at Debenhams, said: 'A job interview can be scary enough without worrying how you might afford the outfit to make the right impression and potentially secure you that all-important job.'

'So we're delighted to be supporting the brilliant work of The House of St Barnabas to make sure its participants look and feel ready for job interviews.

'Our expert personal shoppers will give interviewees one-to-one styling advice and find them the perfect interview outfit, which we'll be letting them take home free of charge.'

The House of St Barnabas was founded in 1846 in London's Soho with the aim of getting homeless people back into work. The work of the charity is supported by its private club, launched last year, whose members include Jarvis Cocker and Miranda Sawyer.
