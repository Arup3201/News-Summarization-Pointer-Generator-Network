New images of the dramatic moment armed commandos stormed the building where the Charlie Hebdo terrorists were holed up have been released. 

Snipers are pictured poised on a roof and heavily armed police are shown preparing to descend on the print works where they go on to shoot dead Cherif and Said Kouachi.

The siege came two days after the Kouachi brothers burst into the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in a terror raid and slaughtered 12 people, including a police officer outside the Paris building on January 7.

As the standoff continued, police attempted to negotiate with the brothers but were told: ‘We are ready to die as martyrs’

The extremists were on the run until they were gunned down at the industrial estate in Dammartin, which is near Charles de Gaulle Airport.

On the day of they were shot dead, the brothers managed to evade the huge police dragnet and hijacked a grey Peugeot 206 being driven by a woman teacher near Montagny-Sainte-Felicite, 30 miles north-east of Paris.

The teacher was freed unhurt soon afterwards, then dozens of police cars began chasing the fugitives along the N2 highway towards Paris. During the chase, shots were exchanged.

The brothers dumped their car and fled on foot to the family-run printing company, 19 miles north east of Paris. They burst into the business – posing as armed police – and took the company’s boss hostage.

Graphic designer Lilian Lepere, 27, who was inside the building, hid in a cardboard box and sent text messages to police after realising the Charlie Hebdo killers were hiding out in his office. The killers were unaware that commandos were being tipped off about their every move.

For more than six hours the graphic designer passed on crucial information.

Armed police surrounded the building and sealed off the town of 8,000 people.

All businesses closed, schools were evacuated and the streets were left deserted except for lines of police vehicles and units of heavily armed officers clad in combat gear. 

These new photographs, released the same day defiant Charlie Hebdo survivors printed a special edition of the magazine, show the final moments of the nightmare, which rocked the world

The terrorist brothers then charged out of the building firing Kalashnikovs at the security forces before being shot dead. 

The end of the pursuit on Friday played out on live TV and social media as one hostage, owner Michael Catalano, was eventually freed from the printing plant.

The siege came two days after the Kouachi brothers burst into the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in a terror raid and slaughtered 12 people, including a police officer outside the Paris building on January 7

Mr Lepere emerged unscathed from the shootout and was taken to a psychological assessment unit where it is understood he was to be reunited with his family last night. 

These new photographs, released today when defiant Charlie Hebdo survivors printed a special edition of the magazine, show the final moments of the nightmare, which rocked the world.

Almost simultaneously, a kosher supermarket in Paris was stormed where Amedy Coulibaly killed four hostages and threatened more violence unless the police let the Kouachis go. He had already killed a woman police officer.

Clamour: The latest issue of Charlie Hebdo, produced one week after many of its editorial staff were murdered, reportedly sold out across France within minutes

Charlie Hebdo resurrected its irreverent and often provocative newspaper today, featuring a caricature of the prophet Mohammed on the cover.

The magazine, which normally sells around 30,000 copies a week, had an initial unprecedented print run of three million. This has been increased to five million after copies were snapped up today.

Issues of the magazine had sold out across Paris news kiosks this morning within minutes. 

Newsagents across the country stocked the magazine, which was also being given away for free on some Air France flights.

A handful of magazines are expected to be available in the UK by the end of the week, but eager British eBay users are bidding three-figure sums for the survivors' edition.

The latest cover shows a weeping Mohammed, holding a sign reading 'I am Charlie' with the words 'All is forgiven' above him.

It is appearing on newsstands one week to the day after the assault in Paris by two masked gunmen that killed eight members of the Charlie Hebdo staff, including its editor and three other cartoonists, along with two police officers.

They said they were wreaking vengeance for the magazine's blasphemous cartoons and jokes about figures sacred to Islam.

One killer shouted 'Charlie Hebdo is dead!' following the massacre.

A top leader of Yemen's al Qaida branch has claimed responsibility for the attack.

Nasr al-Ansi, a commander of Al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP as the branch is known, appeared in an 11-minute internet video, saying that the massacre at Charlie Hebdo was in 'vengeance for the prophet'.

Al-Ansi said France belongs to the 'party of Satan' and warned of more 'tragedies and terror'. He said Yemen's al Qaida branch 'chose the target, laid out the plan and financed the operation'.

The latest issue of Charlie Hebdo maintained the intentionally offensive tone that made the newspaper famous in France.

The first two pages include drawings by the slain cartoonists: One shows a well-known late French nun talking about oral sex; another shows Muslim, Christian and Jewish leaders dividing up the world.

The lead editorial lays out a vigorous defense of secularism, and of the newspaper's right to lampoon religions and hold their leaders accountable - and ends with a critique of the Pope.

'For the past week, Charlie, an atheist newspaper, has achieved more miracles than all the saints and prophets combined.

'The one we are most proud of is that you have in your hands the newspaper that we always made,' it reads.

It also includes a drawing of Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, with a message wishing him good health, penned by murdered cartoonist Georges Wolinski.

This picture was the last tweet by the magazine before the attack.

Elsewhere readers will find doodles by the magazine's editor, Charb, and a cartoon showing two terrorists ascending to heaven.

One, puzzled, asks where all the virgins are that they were promised. In the background the slain staff members are seen on a cloud having sex with multiple women.
