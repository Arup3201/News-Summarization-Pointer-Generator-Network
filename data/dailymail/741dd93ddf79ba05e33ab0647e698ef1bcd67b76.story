New terrestrial planets are believed to be forming around a neighbouring baby solar system – including a giant planet about the same distance to its host star as Saturn is to the Sun.

Planets there may even contain mountains made entirely of diamonds, thanks to an abundance of carbon.

The central star, Beta Pictoris, is twice as large as our sun and astronomers using Nasa’s Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer telescope discovered that it’s surrounded by a disk of extremely carbon-rich gas.

Nasa’s Marc Kucher told Nature: ‘If carbon-rich worlds are forming in Beta Pictoris, they might be covered with tar and smog, with mountains made of giant diamonds. Life on such a planet is not implausible, but it would certainly be exotic.’

The disk of dust and gas surrounding the star, which lies 70 light years away near the constellation Pictor and is only 12 million years old, is produced by collisions between and evaporation of asteroids and comets.

Debris discs are a bigger version of the zodiacal dust in our Solar System.

The Beta Pictoris disc was the first to be imaged - as early as 1984 - and remains the best-studied system.

Young planets could be growing as asteroids bombard them and may even be acquiring atmospheres from the impact of water or ice-rich space rocks.

One planet, Beta Pictoris b, has already been verified by French astronomers using the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope – and it’s a whopper.

Its presence was revealed because the disc was warping in a peculiar way and comets have been detected falling into the star.

‘These are indirect, but tell-tale signs that strongly suggest the presence of a massive planet – about eight times as massive as Jupiter - lying between five and ten times the mean Earth-Sun distance from its host star, about the distance of Saturn in our Solar System,’ said team leader Anne-Marie Lagrange.

‘However, probing the very inner region of the disc, so close to the glowing star, is a most challenging task.’
