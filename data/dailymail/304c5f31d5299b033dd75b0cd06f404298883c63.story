A Britain's Got Talent-style TV show ended in chaos in Germany when three acts needed medical treatment after their live performances went wrong in front of millions of viewers.

First 16-year-old singer Laura Pinski almost choked to death on glitter confetti as it showered down on her just as she was breathing in to hit the high note for her big finish.

Laura was seen struggling for breath and presenter Daniel Hartwich had to rush onto the stage with a glass of water to help clear her throat.

Then opera soprano Simone Ciccarese lost his voice because stunt technicians on the Supertalent show had flooded the stage with too much dry ice.

As he belted out the opera classic O Sole Mio he was lifted up into the air by a hoist.

But due to all of the fog from the machine he lost his voice and was left gasping for breath.

Daniel Hartwich, who was presenting the performance, was left trying to save the situation saying: 'Who would be able to sing well with all that fog. It was a bit too much of an ambitious idea from us.'

Finally, firefighters had to rescue 
contestants Leo and Christian from a blaze when their act - smashing up a
car on stage - sparked a blaze as the petrol tank went up in flames while the pair waited for feedback from the panel of judges.

Other
acts were also plagued by the fog machine and its dry ice such as dancer
Vinzent Wagner who could hardly be seen by viewers as the stage 
lighting was so dark and unable to penetrate the thick billows of fog.

Staff members were heard shouting for fire extinguishers to be brought onto the stage urgently.

Presenter Thomas Gottschalk said: 'Well at least it proves the show is 100 per cent live.'

Co-Presenter
Dieter Bohlen said even before the show started: 'I am waiting with 
anticipation to see if all the acts work out as planned as the pre-runs 
were quite chaotic. Nothing went well in the warm ups.'

The
live show called 'Das Supertalent' was the first in a new series to be 
broadcast from Cologne, Germany, and was watched by 4.49 million people.

The
show has come under criticism of late due to dwindling viewer numbers, 
but Gottschalk also defended the show saying: 'Das Supertalent is one of
the most successful entertainment shows of the year.
