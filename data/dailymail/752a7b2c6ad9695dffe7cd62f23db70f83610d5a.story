When her beloved husband of more than 30 years suffered a stroke, Karen Howe turned to her local council for support.

The mother-of-two asked if they could provide a care home place, explaining that he had begun to lash out in confusion and she was struggling to cope.

But Mrs Howe was stunned when officials refused – and suggested that if her husband was becoming difficult, perhaps she should consider leaving him.

Disgusted: Karen Howe, 55, said she 'felt sick' when the council said she could perhaps consider leaving her husband who had suffered a stroke when she asked for support 

The ‘insulting’ advice from social workers at Nottinghamshire County Council came after 68-year-old Mr Howe was left partially paralysed and prone to bouts of aggressive behaviour after a stroke several weeks ago.

In a letter to the couple’s solicitor, a social work manager said that Mrs Howe ‘does not have to continue to live with her husband if she no longer wishes’, adding: ‘Mr and Mrs Howe may need to explore the usual processes for couples who no longer wish to remain living together, i.e. take account of savings and assets before separating.’

Mrs Howe, 55, who has two adult children, said the advice to leave her husband was ‘insulting and bullying’.

She told the Mail: ‘One of the social workers told me I should either sell the house or divorce Norman in order to fund his care. I felt sick. It was insulting.’

She added: ‘I love him, I want to care for him but he needs proper nursing care.’

Mrs Howe, from Mansfield in Nottinghamshire, said she attributed the advice to a desire on the part of council managers ‘to save as much money as possible’.

Devoted: Norman and Karen on their wedding day in 1982 - she said the advice to leave him was 'insulting' 

Mr Howe, a former coal miner, and his wife have few assets beyond the house they own. And while a council cannot seize the home of a couple to pay for care, the value of a house can be taken into account if the only inhabitant is the person who needs a care home place.

The family’s solicitor Tim Davies said: ‘My concern is that this gentleman is being refused nursing home care by the local authority because they would be forced to meet the costs.’

He said that Mr Howe’s stroke left him ‘with a number of severe medical issues which have left him bedbound’, adding that ‘he has [also] developed severe challenging behaviour’.

Managers at King’s Mill Hospital have offered NHS funding to pay for Mr Howe’s medical bills should he enter a nursing home. However, the offer is for £110 a week – several hundred pounds short of the full bill for a home.

And social workers have said that Mr Howe should remain at the couple’s house, with carers visiting four times a day.

A letter to Mr Davies from Gregg Dunning, a social worker based at the hospital, said: ‘Our assessment ... indicates that Mr Howe’s needs can be met in the community and a nursing home placement is not essential.’

Caroline Baria, director for care at Nottinghamshire County Council, said the authority couldn’t comment on specific care cases.

However she added: ‘We support people to return home after a hospital stay where they are able’ and said social workers are advised not to get involved in residents’ marital issues.

Jailed, carers who threatened dementia patient with eviction 

A trio of bullying carers were yesterday jailed for waging a campaign of terror and humiliation on vulnerable dementia patients in a nursing home.

Elderly residents were subjected to ‘deplorable’ physical and emotional abuse over the course of several months – with one even being told she faced eviction and her belongings had been sent to a tip.

Confused patients also had their hair pulled and were made to pose in degrading positions at the Bupa-run care home.

Relatives of those who suffered at the hands of William Bowman, 22, Chevonne Benson, 23, and Claire Strong, 21, wept in court as they heard graphic details of the abuse.

They condemned the ‘disgusting’ acts carried out at Beacon Edge nursing home in Penrith, Cumbria, after being told by police that the trio saw their actions as ‘a joke’.

The abuse only came to light when an employee blew the whistle on her colleagues, prompting a police investigation.

The 11 victims were aged 72 to 97 and all but one were female. Passing sentence at Carlisle Crown Court, Judge Barbara Forrester said the group ‘showed no humanity or compassion to these elderly victims. It was cold, calculated abuse.’

Bowman was jailed for three-and-a-half years after admitting eight offences of ill-treatment of a person without capacity and was convicted of sexually touching a woman. Benson was given three years after admitting ten counts of ill treatment, while Strong was jailed for one year after admitting three similar offences.

The catalogue of abuse stretched from January to September 2013, and included Bowman pulling the hair of a 90-year-old dementia sufferer and being photographed looking up the nightdress of a 96-year-old woman.

Benson also targeted an 82-year-old retired nurse, telling her she was to be evicted because she had failed to pay her bills, and that her belongings had been sent to a tip. The three carers, who had no previous convictions, have been banned from ever working in the nursing profession again.

Bupa said more than 20 members of staff had been suspended from its four homes in the town in the last year, but denied the suspensions were linked to abuse by the trio.

A Care Quality Commission inspection in July 2013 did not raise concerns about abuse.
