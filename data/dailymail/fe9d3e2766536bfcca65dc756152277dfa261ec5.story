Ms Harrison - who was not wearing a seatbelt - tragically lost her life in the collision

A young mother, killed when the car she was in skidded off the road, might not have died had police acted following an earlier near-miss at the same spot, a coroner ruled.

Christine Harrison, 28, died in March when the car she was travelling in crashed into trees after hitting standing water and leaving the road.

At an inquest held yesterday, Durham Coroner Andrew Tweddle said the collision would never have happened if Durham Constabulary had acted differently following an accident which occurred in the same spot an hour earlier.

A man miraculously escaped injury when his vehicle - which was written off as a result - aquaplaned on the same patch of standing water and left the road at about 4.30am on Saturday, March 9.

Police attended the incident  - which happened on the A66 Bridge Road, near Darlington, County Durham - but the road was not closed and no signs were erected to warn motorists of the potentially deadly hazard ahead.

Around an hour later, Ms Harrison was travelling along the road with friends in a Volkswagen Golf being driven by uninsured, unlicensed driver Daniel Podmore - who was later disqualified from driving and fined for his part in the incident.

A tearful Podmore, 27, told the inquest at Crook Coroner’s Court that visibility on the unlit road made it impossible to see the water until the car hit it, causing him to lose control and veer off the road.

Podmore and three others were injured but Ms Harrison - who was not wearing a seatbelt - tragically lost her life in the collision.

PC Steven Musty, of Durham Constabulary, was the only officer to attend the scene of the first incident.

A risk assessment he conducted showed that he deemed road closure unnecessary after watching a small number of vehicles negotiate the standing water successfully.

He did not consider there to be enough resources to allow him to remain at the scene to act as a visible warning to motorists.

He also decided against erecting any of the police warning signs he carried in his vehicle - though he did ask his control room to contact the council to request rection of flood-warning signs.

He told the inquest: 'It is not normal protocol to leave signs at a scene as I would not have been able to take them with me to the next job.'

Coroner Tweddle recorded a verdict of accidental death but added: 'There are a number of features of this case which give considerable cause for concern.

'I would question the decision making processes that PC Musty employed to come to the conclusions that he did.

'It raises the matter of training, which needs to be addressed.

'I find it difficult to give full credibility to a number of aspects of evidence he has given when I read his statement and take into account evidence he has given today.

'The deceased died an accidental death. It is unlikely she would have died had she been wearing a seatbelt.

'The collision would not have occurred had the incident scene been better managed by Durham Constabulary.'

A police spokesperson said: 'This incident was voluntarily referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission who recommended a local review be carried out.

'This review has been carried out and recommendations have been formulated.

'The coroner today recorded a verdict of accidental death and made the recommendation that police consider reviewing training to ensure staff highlight and manage risk appropriately.

'Durham Constabulary will be giving consideration to the coroner’s findings.

'We continue to extend our condolences to the family of Christine Harrison following the tragic events and our officers are continuing to support them at this extremely difficult time.'

Both PC Musty and Daniel Podmore offered their condolences to Ms Harrison’s family during the inquest.
