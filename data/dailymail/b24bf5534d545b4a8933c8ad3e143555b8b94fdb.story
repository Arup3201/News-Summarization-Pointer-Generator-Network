Police have arrested five men accused of the gang-rape of a Swiss tourist who was camping with her husband in an Indian forest in the central state of Madhya Pradesh.

All of the accused will go before a magistrate on Monday, Dilip Arya, deputy inspector general of police, told Reuters. Police have also recovered the couple's valuables.

The assault on the 39-year-old Swiss woman on Friday night came three months after a 23-year-old physiotherapy student was gang-raped and beaten in a moving bus and thrown bleeding on to the street in a case that sparked outrage in the country. She died later in hospital in Singapore.

The latest incident has again turned the spotlight on the security of women in the world's largest democracy.

One woman is raped every 20 minutes 
in India, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. But police 
estimate only four out of 10 rapes are reported, largely due to victims'
 fear of being shamed by their families and communities.

The Swiss woman and her husband were on a three-month holiday in India and touring the state by bicycle

They had visited the temple town of 
Orchha and were planning to cycle to Agra to visit the Taj Mahal, the 
monument to love, nearly 130 miles away.

They set out from Orchha on Friday 
and had pitched their tent in a forest near Jatia village when they were
 attacked by a group of men armed with wooden sticks.

The men beat the husband, tied him to a tree and then raped the woman, police said.

The woman's husband said the men pounced and beat them with wooden sticks before gang-raping her

Police said the six suspects who have been charged with gang rape are poor farmers from nearby villages

The woman was taken to hospital, where medical examinations proved she had been raped, The News Tribe reported.

And
 in a shocking turn of events the woman was paraded through a staring 
crowd as photographers jostled to take her pictures, mere hours after 
she had been attacked.

Cloaked with a towel to cover her 
face and head, two female police officers gripped the victim's arms as 
she was taken to hospital for a medical examination.

Her picture was taken as she was pulled through the swarm of people.

The arrested men are all aged between 20 and 
25 years and belong to a local tribe known as the Kanjar, Arya said. 
They were also carrying a firearm.

The woman and her husband have left the state and are now at the Swiss embassy in New Delhi.

The Swiss ambassador in India, Linus von Castelmur, has spoken to the couple and has demanded a swift probe of the incident.

attacked, with five men 'gang-raping' the Swiss woman in front of her 
husband

Mr von Castelmur said he was 'most distressed' by the incident and had assured the couple of all help and support.

'Their health and treatment is the priority of the moment,' the embassy said in a statement.

The embassy said it was in touch with
 local authorities in Madhya Pradesh and has urged a 'swift 
investigation and for justice to be done.'

Last 
month, the Swiss government issued a travel notice for India that 
included a warning about 'increasing numbers of rapes and other sexual 
offenses' in the South Asian nation.

In
 January a woman was travelling to her in-laws' home in Punjab when she 
was allegedly snatched and driven to a district bordering Amritsar, the 
Sikh holy city.

Five men 
joined the driver and conductor, who had taken her by motorbike to an 
unknown address, and took turns to rape the 29-year-old.

They dumped her near her in-laws' village the next morning where she told relatives of her ordeal, police said.

A 14-year-old schoolgirl was put on life support in hospital after being brutally gang-raped in rural India in late January.

Police had failed to make any arrests since the horrific attack in the Jalandhar district of Punjab ten days after the attack.
