Every driver in Australia knows it is an offence to use a mobile phone while travelling along the highway.

So at first it might be wondered why Ross Gundry is upset about being pulled over by a traffic cop while he was on the phone.

But the reason for his frown when the police officer told him he was being booked was perhaps understandable – because Mr Gundry was sitting on a cart being pulled along by his Clydesdale horse Toffee at the time.

Buggy bother: Mr Gundry was talking on his mobile phone whilst steering a carriage drawn by his horse Toffee (picture unrelated)

He was flabbergasted when he was issued with an on-the-spot fine for $250 (£163) for using his phone while in charge of a vehicle.

Mr Gundry, who runs Swan Valley Wagon Trails in Perth, Western Australia, told the Hills Gazette Community Newspaper, that he had been travelling all around Perth in the wagon trail business for years and he’d always used his mobile phone while on the road.

‘I thought that a horse-drawn vehicle was OK,’ he said.

In fact it was – under an old law.

Section 265 of the Road Traffic Code relating to use of mobile phones was changed in March 2011 from ‘using a mobile phone while driving a motor vehicle’ to ‘using a mobile phone while driving a vehicle'.

‘I was only travelling at 2kph’ he said, when nine-year-old Toffee pulling his cart along.

He and Toffee had been travelling along the same route for the past four years and he suggested the horse could ‘probably do it on her own.’

Mr Gundry, 56, said he reluctantly accepted the ticket but he is now seeking legal advice on whether he should contest his booking.

‘The law is the law and if I don’t know the law, that’s bad luck. However, there has to be some common sense.’

A ‘reasonable man’ he said, would have pulled him over and issued a verbal warning.

‘There’s no such thing as community policing any more,’ he told the newspaper.

‘It’s pure revenue raising, that’s all this is,’ he said. ‘The least the policeman could have done is warn me the law had changed.’

He added: ‘If police want to be respected they should respect the public and use common sense, too.’
