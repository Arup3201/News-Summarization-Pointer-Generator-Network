A woman who lost seven babies has finally become a mother after losing 17 stone.

Michelle Turner, 35, suffered five miscarriages, an ectopic pregnancy and a stillbirth after ballooning to 30 stone.

She also had to deal with the emotional heartbreak of three failed marriages and turned to comfort eating to fill the void.

But as her weight increased, her chances of a successful pregnancy grew increasingly unlikely.

Doctors eventually warned Ms Turner her weight could kill her and she was given a gastric bypass on the NHS.

She lost 17 stone - over half her of her weight - and at a healthier 13st, she conceived for an eighth time and finally gave birth to daughter Mikayla.

Ms Turner has just celebrated her little girl’s first birthday - and because of her gastric band, now eats less than her baby.

She said: ‘I just can’t believe I’ve finally got a little girl all of my own. It’s all I’ve ever wanted.

‘When I was young I didn’t want to be a princess or pop star - I just wanted to be a mum.

‘I gave up hope so many times and I never thought it was going to have a happy ending.

‘I
 was so depressed and miserable because I just wanted to be a mum, so I 
just stopped caring and started eating. I was virtually housebound.

Ms Turner was told she was so overweight that she was risking her life - as well as her chance of motherhood

‘It was horrible - I was at rock bottom. I had lost everything I ever wanted so many times.

‘Many of my friends took pity on me and made me godmother to eight of their children to make me feel better.

‘I even became godmother to the kids of an Australian couple I met online.

‘But it didn’t help and in the end, I nearly gave up hope completely.’

Ms Turner suffered her first miscarriage when she was just 17 and had another two in her early twenties after her marriage to her first husband, a bus driver, in 1999.

About 15 to 20 per cent of pregnant women in the UK are now overweight or obese.

Most manage to have a successful pregnancy.

However,
 being overweight increases the risk of miscarriage, gestational 
diabetes, high blood pressure, blood clots and infection.

It also increases the risk of haemorrhage, problems with breastfeeding and having a baby with an abnormally high birth weight.

Obese
 pregnant women are more likely to need an induction, an instrumental 
delivery - using forceps or ventouse - or a caesarean.

Their babies are more likely to be stillborn, to have birth defects and to have health problems later in life.

Devastated by her loss, she started gorging and became a virtual recluse and her marriage ended two years later.

She remarried in 2005 but then had two further miscarriages with her second husband, a warehouse worker, in 2006 and 2007.

It was then doctors warned Ms Turner her weight was making it harder to have a successful pregnancy.

The worried medics also warned her obesity was putting strain on her heart and endangering her life.

She
 underwent gastric bypass surgery in 2008 and became pregnant for a 
sixth time but lost that baby because of an ectopic pregnancy.

She split from her second husband shortly after.

A year later she married third husband Carl Turner, 29, and conceived for a seventh time in 2011.

She went to full term but tragically little Jasmine was stillborn.

By now Ms Turner’s weight was down to a healthy 13st and she was determined to make it eighth time lucky.

Baby
 Mikayla arrived healthily in January last year and Ms Turner, of 
Crawley, West Sussex, said: ‘Now she’s a healthy, happy one-year-old and
 I have to pinch myself every day.

‘I still look at her when she’s asleep in my arms and think: Are you really here? I’m so happy.

‘She
 was worth all the heartbreak - every tear I cried and every sobbing 
sleepless night. I’d go through it all again just to have Mikayla.’

Despite the joy of becoming a mother, Ms Turner’s third marriage has also ended in failure.

Ms Turner said: 'She was worth all the heartbreak - every tear I cried and every sobbing sleepless night. I'd go through it all again just to have Mikayla'

Midwife Carol Richardson, who is specialising in maternal obesity at Bournemouth University, said: ‘There is a higher miscarriage rate of 13.6 per cent with obese women, compared to 10.7 per cent in women with a normal weight.

‘There is a link there and there are a number of working hypotheses as to why that is but at the moment no one can quite pinpoint it.

‘It will be said that there are a number of factors but there is no doubt being a heavier weight will have an effect.

‘It may well be to do with the fact obese women need a higher intake of folic acid and vitamin D but they are only advised to take the amount other women take.

‘It may also be that obese women’s diets have an effect on the embryo.

‘I would advise women who are obese and want to have children to lose a bit of weight and try to look after their health.’
