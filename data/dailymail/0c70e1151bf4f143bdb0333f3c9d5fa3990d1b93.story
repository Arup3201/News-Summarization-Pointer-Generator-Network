Five people have been shot dead by police in India after an argument over a restaurant bill escalated into a mass brawl between members of rival Hindu and Muslim communities.

Officers in the town of Dhule, in the Western Indian state of Maharashtra resorted to using live ammunition after violence broke out on Sunday night.

One of the dead is reported to be an 18-year-old man.

Over 200 people were injured including 102 policeman and 100 civilians as rioters trashed shops and set fire to motorcycles and cars.

Policemen called to the scene came under attack from rioters hurling stones, bricks, acid and soda water bottles at them.

They used tear gas, plastic bullets and mounted baton charges to disperse the crowds before opening fire with real ammunition.

Special inspector general Deven Bharti 
said: 'The customer went and took 50 people from his community and 
assaulted the restaurant owner, and people from the owner's community 
also gathered and started arsoning and rioting,'
