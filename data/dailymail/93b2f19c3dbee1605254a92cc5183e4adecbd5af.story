A drive-by attacker launched a knife assault on an innocent man in a horrific case of mistaken identity.

Ayden Godfrey Dixon pulled up next to his victim on a moped and plunged the blade two inches into his neck, narrowly missing an artery.

The 23-year-old, who had mistaken the man for someone he had fought with earlier in the night, was jailed for nine years at Leicester Crown Court.

CCTV footage caught the unprovoked attack as the 24-year-old man walked along a city centre street with friends at 4am on Sunday, February 23.

The footage shows Dixon riding up to the men, stopping his bike and lunging at the victim before riding off.

As the friends realise what has happened, the attacker stops, turns around and watches the group, before speeding away again.

Leicester Crown Court heard that, when Dixon was arrested at his home in the city, he asked: 'Is the guy dead?'

Judge Ebraham Mooncey, who saw the shocking footage, said: 'You rode up on your moped and lunged at him, while still sitting on the moped.

'You lunged towards his neck and collarbone and stabbed him, shouting and swearing.

'You paused for a moment and clearly appreciated what you had done. You then rode off, but someone recognised you.'

Alan Murphy, prosecuting, said the target was knocked backwards and initially thought he had been punched before feeling the blood.

He said: 'The wound was six centimetres deep and four centimetres wide, missing his artery by nine millimetres. The injury could have easily killed him.'

After the sentencing, the victim, who did not attend court, said: 'I am pleased with the sentence and now hope I am able to move on from what happened.'

In a statement read out in court, the man described having difficulty sleeping and said: 'I never thought it could happen to me, or anyone, and it was especially frightening this person stabbed me in the neck.'

He was so traumatised he could not face work, going to the gym or even leaving home alone to walk his dog or visit a shop.

Dixon admitted wounding with intent, possessing a knife and driving the moped having consumed excess alcohol, as well as using it without a licence or insurance.

A breath test showed he had 69 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath, almost double the legal driving limit of 35 microgrammes.

He had bought the moped the day before the attack and, despite drinking throughout Saturday, rode it into the city centre at night, storing the knife under the seat.

Earlier in the night police had issued him with a dispersal notice, giving him five minutes to leave the city centre after he was involved in a skirmish in another pub.

However, he got on to his moped and carried out the stabbing.

The victim and his friends had been in the Lamplighter’s pub, but were not involved in any trouble.

Dixon rode off after the attack, going the wrong way up a street, where he collided with a taxi.

A bystander went to help, but stopped on seeing Dixon was holding a large knife.

Dixon then made off on the damaged moped, which was later found by police in his back garden.

At the time of the attack Dixon was on early release licence from a two-year sentence for burglary and theft, and had been free for four months.

In 2008, he was banned from entering a nearby village for three years under an anti-social behaviour order.

He was described at the time as the ringleader of a young street gang that had terrorised residents.

He was later jailed for ignoring the ASBO.

Sian Cutter, mitigating, said emotional upset had forced Dixon to turn to drink that day.

She said: 'He saw the group in Church Gate and genuinely believed they were involved in the earlier violence and he lashed out.

'He didn’t intend to hit him in the neck, although he intended to stab him, not of such seriousness.

'He has poor thinking skills.'

She said Dixon’s girlfriend was expecting their first child. Dixon was also banned from driving for three years.
