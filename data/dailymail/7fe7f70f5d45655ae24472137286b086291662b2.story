In the moments following his demolition of Luke Saville, Grigor Dimitrov launched a ball high into the Centre Court crowd and very nearly hit a lady who had not been paying attention. It’s conceivable that the man known as Mr Sharapova was sending a wake-up call.

Soon enough, he’ll have made a name in his own right; soon enough the established order of men’s tennis will start to fear the Bulgarian creeping up on them, if they don’t already.

For make no mistake, the 11th seed who dates Maria is a special player.

Volley good: Grigor Dimitrov beat Luke Saville of Australia on Centre Court on Wednesday

Trademark: The Bulgarian uses his distinctive single-handed backhand to good effect at Wimbledon 

His is the shadow heading towards Andy
 Murray and a possible quarter-final meeting, a teenage prodigy finally 
making good at the age of 23 on the promise he showed in winning the 
junior titles here and at the US Open.    

In
 his second-round match yesterday, he demonstrated the all-round game 
that has blossomed since he started working with coach Roger Rasheed 
last October. It is also remarked that his relationship with Sharapova 
has brought about an enhanced dedication and professionalism.

All facets were on show as he won at Queen’s and were obvious in the brutal efficiency of this  6-3, 6-2, 6-4 win.

Dimitrov’s
 backhand is one of the reasons he is known as Baby Fed — a comparison 
to Roger Federer that is known to rankle him, curiously — but it was his
 serve, which reached 135mph, that did most the damage.

He
 lost just 14 points off his deliveries all day, blasting a further 38 
winners off his forehand and that single-handed backhand.

Outclassed: Saville is ranked just 236 in the world and had no answer to Dimitrov

Better half: Dimitrov's girlfriend, Maria Sharapova, is in the women's draw at Wimbledon

‘I’m
 here for the long haul,’ Dimitrov said, before explaining the 
improvements on a game that before this year had only yielded a single 
third-round appearance in Grand Slams. ‘Roger (Rasheed) is a very tough 
but fair man. And I love to work. I love to give everything from myself 
every day.

‘Maria’s one of the best workers out there, one of the best students of the game.

‘I’m different towards my preparation and how I like things to be done. But I’m also a workaholic.’

The
 short-term goal is winning his tough  third-round match against 
Alexandr Dolgopolov, but the longer aim is Murray and cracking the 
so-called ‘big four’ of men’s tennis.

‘I
 know we all want to break through,’ he said. ‘We all want to push 
through those Slams and start winning a few, which I believe is around 
the corner for any one of us.’
