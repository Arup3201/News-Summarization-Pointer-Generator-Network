Australia Day, summer festivals and our myriad of sporting events are all seen as signs that Australians are happy and joyful, but we aren't as positive as we may think.

On International Happiness Day it has become apparent that Australian's really aren't all that cheery, with the nation rating a shocking 43rd out of 143 countries on a world happiness scale.

Gallup's Positive Experience Index shows that Latin Americans are the most happy people on the planet, taking up the winning ten spots in the poll.

The people of Paraguay were found the be the happiest in the world with an Index rating of 89, 18 points above the mean

Australia has ranked lower on the Positive Experience Index than the African country Rwanda,

Australia however, ranks lower than Argentina, Bhutan, Rwanda, the United States, Indonesia, Uzbekistan, Mexico, Kenya, Nigeria and 34 others.

According to the poll, Australia has the same happiness level (index) as Austria, China, Peru, South Africa, Thailand and the United Kingdom.

Telephone and face-to-face interviews with 1000 adults from each country are used to collect the data through questions asked about their happiness levels from the previous day. 

The rankings are decided after gathering the answers to a series of questions such as did you feel well-rested yesterday? Were you treated with respect? Did you smile and laugh a lot? 

Bringing up the rear was Sudan with a score of more than 20 points lower than the mean

The top ten countries were all from Latin America which is the first time in ten years of global tracking this has occured

Mexico ranked 40th in the poll, three spots above Australia and reported more positive experiences

Apparently Australian didn't laugh a lot the previous day.

Although we are ranked lower than perhaps expected, the overall score from the poll has remained fairly consistent to previous years with a world index score of 71.

Australia is placed just four points above this mean with a score of 75. 

According to the poll, at least 70 percent of people around the world laugh and smile whilst experiencing enjoyment in their everyday lives and 50 percent said they learnt or did something interesting the previous day.

This is the first time in ten years of global tracking that all of the top countries on the index are in Latin America. 

The countries experiencing dampened spirits and the lowest positive emotions worldwide were Afghanistan, Nepal, Lithuania, Georgia, Bosnia, Turkey, Serbia, Bangladesh, Tunisia and Sudan bringing up the rear.

Through International Day of Happiness, the United Nations stress the importance of connections with others

The entire Middle East and North Africa (except Saudi Arabia) have scores lower than the global mean.

However, it is surprising that conflict-torn Afghanistan documented that they laughed and smiled a lot the day before the interview.

Through the third annual International Day of Happiness, the United Nations  stress the importance of connections with others, especially in vibrant and crowded cities which incites social isolation.

The aim of the day is to share positive messages with others through all mediums.
