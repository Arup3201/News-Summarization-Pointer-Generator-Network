Oregon's new governor will be the first open bisexual to serve as a state's chief executive when Secretary of State Kate Brown steps in for resigning Gov. John Kitzhaber on Friday. 

The embattled now-former Democratic governor Kitzhaber, 67, has resigned his office amid allegations his fiancee used her relationship with him to enrich herself with contracts for her environmental consulting business. 

'I am announcing today that I will resign as Governor of the State of Oregon,' he wrote in a media statement Friday afternoon.

In his lengthy statement he admitted that 'I have become a liability to the very institutions and policies to which I have dedicated my career and, indeed, my entire adult life. As a former presiding officer I fully understand the reasons for which I have been asked to resign.'

Brown is married to a man but has made no secret about her sexual orientation – and has been embraced for it in one of America's bluest states whose largest city has adopted the slogan 'Keep Portland weird.'

'I apologize to all those people who gave of their faith, time, energy and resources to elect me to a fourth term last year and who have supported me over the past three decades,' Kitzhaber said o Friday.

Brown has had nearly as tumultuous a week as Kitzhaber. On Wednesday she returned home early at Kitzhaber's request from a conference in Washington, D.C., expecting the resignation that would come days later.

But when she arrived, the governor told her he had no idea why she was there.

'Late Tuesday afternoon, I received a call from the governor while I was in Washington, D.C., at a secretaries of state conference. He asked me to come back to Oregon as soon as possible to speak with him in person and alone,' Brown said Thursday in a statement.

'I got on a plane yesterday morning and arrived at 3:40 in the afternoon. I was escorted directly into a meeting with the governor. It was a brief meeting. He asked me why I came back early from Washington, D.C., which I found strange. I asked him what he wanted to talk about. The governor told me he was not resigning, after which, he began a discussion about transition.'

'This is clearly a bizarre and unprecedented situation,' she said. 

Brown is the second governor to publicly self-identify along the LGBT spectrum. In 2004 New Jersey Gov. Jim McGreevey came out as gay in the course of an investigation into a nepotism scandal involving a boyfriend whom he had appointed to a key position. McGreevey resigned three months later.

No state has elected an openly gay or bisexual governor. Arizonans chose Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema as the first bisexual member of Congress in 2012.

A transgender woman who served 20 years on Navy SEAL teams as a man announced this week that she will run for Congress in Maryland next year.

Brown is a native of Minnesota who has described her upbringing in a staunchly Republican family. She studied environmental conservation at the University of Colorado Boulder and earned a law degree from Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Oregon.

It has been nearly 20 years since she first publicly identified herself as bisexual while a lobbyist for the Women's Rights Coalition.

Her 15-year marriage includes two adult children from husband Dan Little's first marriage.

Kitzhaber met with his staff late on Friday morning to tell them his plans.

Senate Minority Leader Ted Ferrioli, the state's leading Republican lawmaker, said he would not attend the swearing-in of Secretary of State Kate Brown, who will take office as the first openly bisexual governor.

She will serve until at least November 2016, when a special election will fill the governor's chair more permanently. 

'What should be a day of celebration is turning into a day of reflection and mourning,' Ferrioli told a crowd gathered in the Capitol building in Salem. 

He said he would 'grieve for the departure in disgrace of one governor and to hope for the healing that can only come if the next governor turns away from policies that put symbolic gestures ahead of the real needs of our citizens.'

Oregon;'s top Democrats including House Speaker Tina Kotek urged Kitzhaber to resign amid a growing ethics scandal involving his fiancee, a green-energy consultant accused of using her relationship with the governor to land contracts for her business

Kitzhaber and Hayes face an uncertain legal quandary because of the ethics controversy, which could become a criminal investigation

Kitzhaber attracted horrible national press last year when Oregon's health authorities decided to scrap their chronically buggy Obamacare website after pouring $305 million into the effort to broker medical insurance plans along the model established by the Affordable Care Act.

As his march to the political scafford proceeded this week, a report surfaced that had his office asking government agencies to delete all his personal emails.

Willamette Week reported that Kitzhaber personal assistant Jan Murdock wrote agency heads with a specific directive that the 'Governor’s office wants anything that is in the email account ... removed from archive.'

Influence-peddling is a crime and could put Kitzhaber and Hayes in legal jeopardy. The U.S. Justice Department opened a criminal probe on Feb. 6.

In January former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell was sentenced to 2 years in prison for using his influence to win research dollars for a supported who lavished him and his wife with money and gifts.
