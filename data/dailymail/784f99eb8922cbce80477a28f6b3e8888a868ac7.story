The iconic US restaurant chain Hooters, famed for its busty, scantily-clad waitresses is celebrating its 30th birthday today.

Conceived as an April fool's day joke in 1983, Hooters now has more than 460 
branches, or 'breastaurants' in America and currently operates in a further 24 other countries around 
the world.

Sticking to its 'Delightfully 
tacky yet unrefined' mantra since opening it's first outlet in Florida with its heady combination of sexy waitresses, chicken wings and beer proving a winning formula.Â

All the breast: Iconic restaurant chain Hooters, famous for its scantily clad waitresses is celebrating its 30th birthday today

Created by six friends with no restaurant experience it has gone on to have its 
own calendars, casino, airline and even a video game.

Instantly recognisable by their white tank tops emblazoned with the company's Hootie the Owl logo, Hooters girls have served a raft of celebrities over the years and even posed with former President George H. W. Bush.

The original 'Hooters Girl' Lynne Austin, shot from being a telephone operator in Florida to an international celebrity and Playboy model.

Three decades later Lynne, now 52, is still recognised wherever she goes with Americans dying to know about her life as a Hooters Girl.

She said: 'Hooters is pretty damn sexy - people would come to see me while I was working.

'There would be three hours for chicken wings and beer. They would wait and wait and wait, it blew my mind.'

First of many: The original Hooters restaurant which opened in Clearwater, Florida, in 1983. The chain now has more than 460 branches across the U.S.

Founders: Clearwater businessmen Lynn Stewart, Gil DiGiannantonio, Ed Droste, Billy Ranieri, Ken Wimmer and Dennis Johnson came up with the idea for the chain as an April Fool's Day joke

High flyers: Hooters has since gone on to operate a casino hotel in Las Vegas and even an airline - Hooters Air

Lynne was scouted by one of the Hooters owners after winning a bikini competition and offered a job as their 'billboard girl'.

But she very nearly missed out on a life in the spotlight - because she didn't even want to compete.

She
added: 'My mum said 'there's a bikini contest and I think you could win
it' but I didn't want to do it as I didn't think it was my gig.'

But after a lot convincing and her mum's promise to match the prize money even if she lost, Lynne won the competition and went on to become the face of Hooters.

She said: 'I'll sometimes get noticed at the shops or if I go out to have dinner, more by the old school people who have been around forever.

'Everybody just thinks it's cool and wants to hear about how it changed my life.'
