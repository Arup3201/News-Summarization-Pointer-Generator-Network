England Under 20s drew with Turkey on Monday night to secure the point they needed to win the Four Nations Tournament in Holland.

Having already beaten the hosts and Germany, Aidy Boothroyd's team just needed to avoid defeat in their third and final match to lift the trophy.

And the Young Lions looked on course for a third victory in succession when Wolves' Kortney Hause put them in front on 21 minutes.

England's Kortney Hause (pictured in Thursday's win over Germany) was on target as they drew 1-1 with Turkey to claim the Four Nations Tournament in Heerenveen, Holland

In the end, despite dominating much of the game, they had to settle for a draw when Berat Tosun equalised for Turkey six minutes into the second half.

Captain on the night Matt Targett and Isaac Hayden, skipper for the wins over Germany and Holland, lifted the trophy together on the pitch in Heerenveen at the final whistle.

'We're delighted with the way the tournament has gone and to win it is really, really pleasing,' said boss Boothroyd afterwards.

'For the players to get a few results like this and to win against such strong opposition is a real feather in the cap.

'It's a really big achievement to come away from home and get results against the host nation and against a very strong German side - and to get a draw against a much older Turkish team is a fantastic achievement as well.

'In the end it's all worked out really well and we're all very happy.'

Brimming with confidence after their 1-0 win over Germany on Thursday and Saturday's 3-2 success over Holland, England started on the front foot.

Pat Frost also captured the moment Isaac Hayden and Matt Targett lifted the trophy

And they gained their reward on 21 minutes when Targett's free-kick was headed back by Liverpool's Lloyd Jones for Hause to control on his chest and finish left-footed in one smooth movement.

Turkey scored their leveller shortly after the break and both sides then saw a man sent off.

Arsenal forward Chuba Akpom picked up a second yellow card for a late tackle before Cenk Sahin also went for a badly timed challenge.

The contest threatened to boil over at time during the second half but England held out for the point they needed to wrap up tournament success.

Aidy Boothroyd's team took seven points from their three matches to claim the trophy

Boothroyd added: 'We played probably the best football of the tournament in the first half.

'We were excellent. We were creating lots of chances, making really good decisions and we really dominated the game and we could have had two or three.

'In the second half it was a little bit different. They came out at us and we didn't start particularly well. They equalised and we got a bit complacent.

'We managed to hang on in there in the end.'
