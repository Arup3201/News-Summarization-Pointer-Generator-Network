Welcome to North Korea's first 'luxury' ski resort - which actually looks a little more like a prison camp than the slopes Verbier.

The Masikryong ski resort, near Wonsan, opened for business earlier this year. Previously, it was home to a clear mountainside covered in lime trees.

Now it is a sprawling 1,400-hectare resort - complete with several expansive eating areas, uncomfortable-looking ski lifts and, of course, screens showing pro-government propaganda.

This picture shows North Korea's first ever ski resort - which opened for business earlier this year. The Masikryong resort is set over a sprawling 1,400-hectare site and includes 70 miles (110km) of multi-level slopes

Hundreds of snow canons are used to keep the resort's 110 kilometres (70 miles) of multi-level slopes looking their best.

Those visiting may wish to stay in the resort's elaborate hotel - which has a large swimming pool and a much more modest bar.

In pictures taken
 by Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet's Thomas Eriksson, ski-iers appear to 
be having a wonderful time on the Masikryong slopes - and wave and laugh
 at at camera.

The North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un visited the Masikryong resort in December - testing out the lifts while surveying his surroundings.

He,
 however, appeared to forget one rather vital item - and was pictured 
with his ski-free legs dangling below as he made his way up the 
mountains.

At the time, the leader was said to note 'with great satisfaction' that everything was 'impeccable'.

He
 also gave instructions to serve visitors to the site well - and ensure 
visitors may 'keenly feel the loving care of the party', local media 
reported.

The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) described the slopes as a 'great monumental structure in the era of Songun', referring to the nation's 'military first' policy.

The military also played a leading role in the project.

Kim was accompanied by top military leaders and, Pak Myong-Choi, a top sports official known to be associated with Kim's uncle who was executed last year.

Jang Song-Thaek, Kim's powerful political mentor, was put to death in a shock purge on charges including corruption and plotting to overthrow the state.

The purge was the biggest political upheaval since Kim, aged around 30, took power after the death of his father and longtime ruler, Kim Jong-Il, in December 2011.Â 

The resort made 
headlines in August when Switzerland blocked a $7.6 million sale of ski 
lifts to Pyongyang, calling it a 'propaganda project' for the 
impoverished Stalinist regime.

The
 young leader has shown a fondness for expensive, high-profile leisure 
projects in and around the showpiece capital Pyongyang including a 
massive new water park, an amusement park and a luxury horseback riding 
club.

The Munsu Water Park 
in Pyongyang opened in October to much fanfare, with the 109,000-square 
metre venue sporting dozens of indoor and outdoor pools, water slides 
and saunas.

Kim in 
September also watched films at a new '4D' movie theatre built in the 
newly-renovated Rungna People's amusement park, state media reported 
earlier.

He was 
photographed riding a roller coaster in the Rungna amusement park in 
Pyongyang when it reopened in July 2012 after renovations ordered by 
Kim.
