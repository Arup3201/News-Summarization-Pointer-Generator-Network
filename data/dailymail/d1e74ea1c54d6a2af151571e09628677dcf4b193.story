Two food factory workers were injured after two explosions in New Jersey.

The explosions took place at Pharmachem Laboratories in Totowa on Saturday at 7pm, The Star-Ledger reported.

'People could have been killed — normal 
operation, you'd have had five, ten people working in there — that’s how
 violent the explosion was,' Totowa Fire Marshal Allen Del Vecchio told 
the newspaper.

'The damage was in the millions,' Del Vecchio said.

The entire rear of the building was blown out.

'I felt my house actually shake from the explosion, and that's about a mile away,' Christopher Tencza told WABC.

The two workers were hospitalized for minor injuries, Del Vecchio told The Star-Ledger.

The first explosion was likely from 'a heat exchange unit, which was heating a vat containing ingredients of an eggnog flavoring power' and the second was likely from 'a pocket of hot air or gas [...] built up inside the vat,' the newspaper explained.

Del Vecchio dismissed the idea that the eggnog ingredients were responsible, the newspaper said. The investigation is ongoing.
