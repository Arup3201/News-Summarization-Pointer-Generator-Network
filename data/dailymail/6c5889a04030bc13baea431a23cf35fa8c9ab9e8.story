A young Australian woman is spearheading a global campaign petitioning Facebook to remove 'body shaming' emoticons and status options from the social media site.

Rebecca Guzelian, along with seven other women around the world, has partnered with Endangered Bodies, an international movement challenging body image standards, to launch a campaign to remove the ‘I feel fat’ and ‘I feel ugly’ emoticons from the social media site.

Ms Guzelian, a counsellor and intern psychologist, is one of over ten thousand people to back the 'Fat is not a feeling' petition, and claims that the options perpetuate and normalise body shaming, especially in young people.

'When I first heard that the 'fat' and 'ugly' feelings options were made available for people to select on Facebook, I was shocked and definitely felt compelled to work alongside Endangered Bodies to do something about it,' Ms Guzelian told Daily Mail Australia.  

Endangered Bodies has been petitioning Facebook to remove the options from their site, and has partnered with the women to start national petitions to remove the options from all forms of the website.

Women from the UK, Ireland, the US, Germany, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, and Australia have partnered together to post their personal stories and experience with body shaming to promote the campaign, which has garnered  thousands of signatures in just a few days.

Facebook has long held itself up as a community driven social media site, and over the ten years since it's inception, has introduced different features to reflect the habits of the millions of people on the site.

The 'fat' and 'ugly' emoticons were first introduced in 2013 as part of the 'feelings' feature for status updates, along with almost 100 other emoticons that can be individualised to reflect a user's mood. 

Ms Guzelian said the emoticons normalise body shaming and encourages young people to use the words publicly to speak negatively about themselves. 

'Encouraging this kind of 'fat talk' is not okay – and that’s exactly what Facebook is doing by offering these words as options,' Ms Guzelian said.

Psychologist Sarah McMahon from Endangered Bodies Australia, along with her colleagues from around the world, have been petitioning the social media giant since the status options were introduced but have received no response.

'Facebook has not been listening. Not only do these features remain as emoji selections, Facebook have not addressed the critcisms that this plays in contributing to culture of body shaming,' Ms McMahon said.

'This is despite the fact Facebook claims that one of their core values is to build social value- which in this instance they are not doing. This is particularly concerning when research demonstrates that Facebook use is already associated with increased risk of eating disorders, weight concern and anxiety,' she said.

'"Feeling fat" was once the language of clinical eating disorders and it is now normative in our society. It is well documented that "fat talk", as using such terms is known, perpetuates body image issues and body shame rather than reduce it.

Over 10,000 people have signed the 'Fat is not a feeling' petition on Change.org

Ms Guzelian said that she and the other women hope that the social media giant will recognise that the emoticons are contributing to body shaming issues, and that it is a concern for Australians. 

The petition explains that '‘fat’ and ‘ugly’ are adjectives. They describe physical characteristics, NOT feelings.'

'Having these word choices completely normalises using derogatory descriptive terms in the place of real feelings. What’s worse is that these adjectives are judgemental and forced on us by society to make women (and increasingly men) feel negatively about their otherwise healthy bodies,' the petition says.

'When someone says “I feel fat” what they’re really communicating is that they feel unattractive, unhappy, embarrassed and insecure about their body. And believe it or not, these feelings are most commonly a response to the unrealistic, culturally promoted ideals of thinness and beauty that are shoved in our faces every single day.' 

Ms Guzelian, who works as a counsellor at The Butterfly Foundation, Australia's leading body supporting people who struggle with eating disorders and body image problems, said that young people are becoming increasingly obsessed with how they look. 

'For young people, who are on Facebook from nine, ten, 11 years of age, having a huge platform like this tell them it's normal to speak about themselves like that is a huge issue.' 

'Facebook encourages people to focus on and scrutinise the way they look, so as to present the best version of themselves in the online world. Doing this really places an extreme focus on the external, instead of the internal,' she said.

'We begin to measure our worth by the way that we look – because let’s face it, Facebook isn’t the place that we are all posting about the important reasons why we are great, wonderful valuable and worthy people on the inside.'

Ms Guzelian said that the campaign was as much about encouraging a positive discussion about body image as it was a bid to have the emoticons removed.   

'There are things everywhere in the world that tells us to be ashamed of how we look, and why we feel bad about ourselves,' she said.

'There are cues everywhere around us, guiding us down that path and if we can prick up our ears and take notice, then we can choose to see ourselves and others in a different light.'
