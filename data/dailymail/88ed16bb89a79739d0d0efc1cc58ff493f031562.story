Britain's beleaguered retail sector saw slight respite last month as sales grew 0.6 per cent, but experts warned shoppers are set to 'close their wallets and hunker down' after their pre-Christmas splurge.

Retail sales volumes grew 0.6% month-on-month in December, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, compared to a revised 0.5% decline the previous month. This was slightly below the 0.7% growth forecast by the City.

The figure boosted hopes that the total economy would avoid contraction in the last months of 2011 but economists expect retailers to struggle in the new year as cash-strapped consumers rein in spending.

The slight increase in sales was not sufficient, however, to save high street names like Peacocks and Past Times, who have both fallen into administration recently despite posting positive Christmas sales.

The increase in sales volumes was driven by clothing chains and department stores and came as store-price inflation dropped to its lowest rate for 16 months, the ONS said.

There was evidence that spending on big-ticket items was still being held back as sales at household goods stores fell by 2.4% month-on-month, the biggest drop since April 2010.

Economists have warned the sector is set to struggle this year, despite the growth in sales last month, as shoppers continue to cut back on non-essential spending and the economy teeters on the edge of recession.

A graph from the Office of National Statistics shows that while the volume of sales has only increased slightly compared with last Christmas, the value of sales has increased more due to the increased price of goods

‘The risk remains that pressurised and worried consumers will put away their purses and wallets, and hunker down for an extended period after a late flurry of spending in the run-up to Christmas and then taking advantage of the best of the bargains in the clearance sales,’ said Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight.

The ONS said consumers spent £42.1billion in the retail sector last month, compared to £29billion in November and £39billion in 2010.

Clothing and footwear stores posted a 1.8 per cent month-on-month volumes growth while department stores such as John Lewis recorded 1.2 per cent monthly growth.

Sales at household goods store dropped by 2.4 per cent month-on-month, while food store sales saw weaker growth, with volumes rising month on month by 0.4 per cent and 1.2 per cent year on year.

Profit margins across the entire retail industry have been hit by big discounts, putting further pressure on companies struggling to stay afloat.

A host of household names have run into severe financial trouble recently, including fashion retailer Peacocks, lingerie firm La Senza and outdoor specialist Blacks Leisure.
