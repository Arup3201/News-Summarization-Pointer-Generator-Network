Filth: Prince Charles' neighbour Clive Wilson with some of the rubbish left by Cotswold District Council, outside his home in Doughton, Gloucestershire

Angry Cotswolds neighbours of Prince Charles have slammed their local council after waste in their village lay uncollected for a month.

Unsightly piles of rubbish have built up close to the entrance to his Highgrove estate, attracting vermin.

Residents of Doughton in Gloucestershire, where the council tax on a band D property is just under £1,500 a year, missed out on their regular pick up after snow hit on January 19.

Cotswold District Council’s waste contractor Ubico cancelled collections for a week across the whole district, claiming the slippery conditions were too dangerous for the workers.

But instead of putting on extra collections as soon as the roads were clear, it told residents they would have to wait until their next scheduled round – in Doughton that meant yet another fortnight.

'We’ve only had one since the middle of December. The service has been an utter disgrace since Christmas,' said farmer Clive Wilson, aged 50, a neighbour of the Prince's estate.

'We’re in an area of outstanding natural beauty yet the council seems happy to let it look like a rubbish dump for weeks.

'I understand the health and safety aspect and I wouldn’t want any binmen to be injured, but what about our health and safety?

'The rats and foxes have had a go at the sacks and the litter is spreading.

'The council should have put on extra rounds as soon as it was safe, but I guess they weren’t prepared to pay for the overtime.'

Less than two miles down the road in the small town of Tetbury residents have also complained of having to leave bins out on the pavement.

The rubbish left outside Elmestree House. Elmestree is next door to Prince Charles' country home, Highgrove

There has been no collection since mid-January and the rubbish has been piling up

The council organised emergency waste collection points in Cirencester and Tetbury on February 4, but householders had to transport their rubbish there themselves.

Cotswold District Council came under fire from council taxpayers two years ago years ago when accounts revealed it paid £19,000 to magician Shay McConnon to boost staff morale at a time when it was cutting £1.4million from its budget.

Ubico was also heavily criticised for suspending collections for over a week in Cheltenham.

The firm is owned by the district council and Cheltenham Borough Council. Neither were available for comment at time of writing.
