Pope Francis urged bishops to say 'speak their minds' today as a historic sex conference got underway at the Vatican.

The pope hailed the synod of bishops as a once-in-a-generation opportunity to review Catholic teaching on controversial topics such as abortion, contraception and gay unions.

The so-called Extraordinary Synod on the Family is discussing the results of a survey on relationships and sex sent to every diocese worldwide earlier this year.

Around 200 bishops will spend the next two weeks addressing the gulf between what the Church says about issues such as divorce and pre-marital sex, and what many followers actually do.

'You have to say what you feel the Lord tells you to say, without concerns of human respect and without fear,' Francis instructed the bishops at the start of their meeting.

At the same time, he urged the nearly 200 cardinals, bishops and priests gathered for the synod to listen to one another with humility 'and welcome with an open heart what our brothers say.'

The discussions beforehand have already caused bitter arguments among senior clergy.

Reformist cardinals have already proposed allowing the divorced and remarried to take Communion. This is currently banned as the church does not recognise divorce so remarried people are regarded as adulterers.

But conservative bishops are totally opposed to this move, believing it is a threat to the institution of marriage.

Other possible changes, such as the blessing of gay civil unions, would be even more contentious.

Pope Francis seems determined to shake up the Church and has shown some signs of liberal views.

'Who am I to judge,' he said when asked about gay priests last year, and he previously baptised the child of a gay union in Argentina.

While insisting he is a 'son of the church,' Francis has also said the church must show more mercy and be a 'field hospital' for wounded souls.

Conservative churchmen are hoping that the synod will simply reaffirm church doctrine and make it better understood by Catholics.

On the eve of the synod Francis said that the church should be less judgmental of those in non-conventional living situations such as couples who live together before marriage.

He told an Argentine newspaper: 'What should the church do ? Expel them from their breast? or approach them and try to bring them close and teach them the word of God? I am in favour of the latter position.'

Opening the conference he warned the bishops not to merely express what they thought he wanted to hear.

He urged participants: 'Say everything that you feel.'

'After the last consistory a cardinal wrote to me saying it was a shame that some cardinals did not have the courage to speak their minds out of respect for the pope thinking perhaps that the pope thought something different to them. This is not good.'

In a bid to encourage debate, the Vatican is restricting public information about what is said behind closed doors during the synod. In the past it has released texts of individual bishops' comments.
