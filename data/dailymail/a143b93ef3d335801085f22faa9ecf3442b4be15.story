With Russia's economy shrinking for the first time in five years amid an onslaught of Western sanctions, you would expect its citizens to be holding back on needless expenditure.

But, as these Instagram images show, some Russians have been splashing their roubles on caviar, posting pictures of the delicacy online.

Despite the country's financial woes, many have uploaded the photographs with the hashtag '#какойкризи' - which translates as '#whatcrisis'.

Several photographs also include the the hashtag '#падениерубля' - meaning 'fall of the rouble' - after the value of the nation's currency plummeted once again.

While red caviar, made from salmon roe, is associated with luxury and wealth, it is less costly in Russia because of the vast harvest of the fish off the country's eastern coast.

Despite this, after today's announcement that the country's gross domestic product had fallen for the first time since 2009, many Russians would be expected to be striking caviar off their shopping lists.

Sliding oil prices and Western sanctions over the conflict in Ukraine have continued to take their toll on Russia, whose wealthier citizens have started to move their money abroad.

Plummeting: How the value of the rouble has fallen against the pound in the last year

Many Russian companies and banks have been locked out of Western capital markets following the sanctions imposed on the country for its involvement in annexing Crimea.

Inflation is also growing rapidly. Amid the rouble's collapse earlier this month, Russia's central bank raised interest rates to 17 percent from 10.5 percent to prop up the currency. 

Finance Minister Anton Siluanov warned last week that the economy could shrink 4 per cent next year based on oil prices of around $60 a barrel - their lowest level for many years.  

In a response to the emerging crisis, Russian President Vladimir Putin last week placed a cap on the price of vodka in an attempt to boost morale and stop citizens from making their own bootleg booze.

According to a study by leading international universities last year, a quarter of all Russian men die before they reach their mid-fifties, and their love of alcohol - particularly vodka - is partly to blame.
