It wouldn't be a bank holiday weekend without railway engin-eering works, motorway chaos and, of course, a dose of good old gloomy British weather.

But even by our low national expectations, forecasters have warned that Monday is shaping up to be a washout.

An estimated 14million cars will take to the roads as families return home from the last long weekend of the summer.

Backlog: Roadworks will blight 85 sections of motorway, including parts of the M1, M5 and M25

According to the Highways Agency, roadworks will blight 85 sections of motorway, including parts of the M1, M5 and M25.

The RAC predicted that today and tomorrow will be the busiest on the roads, especially as there are major music festivals at Leeds and Reading, adding that traffic was already building yesterday afternoon.

But forget jumping on a train – engineering works will also cause delays on rail routes. The worst disruption is expected on the West Coast Mainline, which is closing for work at Watford.

Network Rail last night urged passengers travelling between Glasgow and London to seek alternative routes or expect significant delays to journey times.

Meanwhile, more than two million Britons will head overseas this weekend to escape the cold and wet – with a quarter flying via Heathrow, according to travel association ABTA.

And after a week of unseasonably chilly conditions, there’s little good news for those staying in Britain, as bank holiday temperatures are expected to stay lower than average.

John Griffiths, forecaster at MeteoGroup, said: ‘The August average is 23C (73F) in London but we have been stuck around the 20C-21C (68F-70F) mark for the last few days and this is set to continue.

‘Bank holiday Monday is shaping up to be wet across much of the country and the wet weather will stick around for a few days in the south of England.’

Mr Griffiths added that parts of the north and Scotland would escape Monday’s rain, and once the wet weather has passed through, temperatures will increase – although only by a degree or so, remaining below average.
