The fugitive being questioned over the killing of the policewomen and two other murders was arrested and released on police bail three months ago.

Dale Cregan, 29, was held at Manchester Airport in June after returning on a flight from Thailand.

But he was allowed home pending further inquiries. Cregan had been questioned over the murder of Mark Short, who was gunned down in a Manchester pub on May 25.

By the time the police finally had him
under lock and key on Tuesday, he was suspected of three more – the two 
policewomen and Short’s father, David, in a gun and grenade attack in 
August 10. 

Greater Manchester's Chief Constable 
Sir Peter Fahy today defended his force's decision to release Cregan, 
insisting it was 'absolutely normal' for him to have been bailed.

Sir Peter said: 'It is absolutely normal in the course of complex crime inquiries that when people are arrested there are occasions where there is insufficient evidence available for them to be charged.

'In those circumstances suspects have to be released on bail as there are strict time limits covering how long suspects can be held in custody without charge.

'That is exactly what happened in this case.'

A spokesman for the force said officers could hold a suspect for a total of 96 hours, if magistrates grant permission.

The spokesman would not disclose how long Cregan was held for before being bailed.

Until recently Cregan, who has worked as a roofer and lived 
for a time in Tenerife, had few major dealings with police.

Born in Tameside to parents Paul and Anita Cregan, and with a younger sister, he was well-known as an intimidating character.

His image was enhanced by his facial appearance. He told friends that he lost his eye after being hit in Thailand.

Police had offered a £50,000 reward for information about the murders of David Short, 46, and his son Mark, 23.

The Short family had been at 
loggerheads with a rival clan for more than ten years but it spilled 
into bloodshed – reputedly over drug debts – in May when Mark Short was 
killed.

A gunman walked into the Cotton Tree pub in Droylsden on May 25 and Mark Short died from a gunshot wound to the neck.

Four men have been charged in connection with his murder and are due to enter pleas at Manchester Crown Court in November.

David Short was killed in a gun and 
grenade attack at his home in Clayton on August 10 and earlier this 
month a 33-year-old man appeared at Manchester Crown Court charged with 
his murder.

David Short is understood to have 
vowed revenge for his son’s death and had threatened to murder relatives
of Mark Short’s killer in retaliation.

Short senior had apparently been 
repeatedly warned that his life was in danger and been wearing a 
bulletproof vest for the past eight years.

By 2004, police had issued him with 
three ‘Osman’ warnings – served when officers receive intelligence that 
someone is at risk of serious harm or being killed. It is believed he 
may have been killed in a ‘pre-emptive strike’.

Both father and son had served time behind bars.

In 2006, David Short was jailed for 
six years for possessing a firearm with intent, after he and his son 
drove a gunman away from a street where shots were fired in daylight.

Six months after the shooting, Short 
battered a man during a drunken row at the Garibaldi pub in Gorton, 
which led to a conviction for wounding.

Back in the 1990s he was accused of intimidating a witness after threatening a woman while wearing a balaclava.

Mark Short also had a history of 
violence, admitting firearms offences following the 2006 incident 
involving his father, but was spared a custodial sentence.

But in 2008 he was jailed for five 
years and described as a dangerous young man by a judge sentencing him 
for robbery and grievous bodily harm.

The amateur boxer had been one of a 
gang of three who carjacked a 60-year-old man in east Manchester before 
going on to knock a shopkeeper unconscious in an attack three months 
later.

In the aftermath of the father and son killings, a huge manhunt had failed to find the suspect.

The operation to track him down was 
costing police £150,000 a day and almost the entire armed response 
police units of Merseyside, Greater Manchester, Lancashire and Cheshire 
were involved.

Officers drove digital billboards with posters around North Manchester and the Tameside area.

Posters were displayed across the city
and flashed up on giant screens inside Manchester City’s Etihad stadium
during their match against Queens Park Rangers this month.

The high-profile publicity campaign 
went alongside police searches of more than 100 properties and hundreds 
of officers were assigned to the case.

Teams of armed officers involved in the manhunt were aware of the increasing involvement of grenades in crime in the North West.

They were told the Russian-made military devices each contained 1,000 ball bearings with a ‘kill zone’ of more than 25 yards.

One of the best-known Soviet grenades is the F1, nicknamed the Little Lemon, which has a four-second fuse.

Based on a French design and introduced during World War II, it is now obsolete but can still be found in war zones and is highly prized by gangsters.

This year two Merseyside gangsters were jailed for life after planting a grenade in bushes outside former Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish’s home. It was apparently intended for a neighbour.

They were responsible for a merciless campaign of violence including numerous shootings but their weapon of choice was the grenade.
