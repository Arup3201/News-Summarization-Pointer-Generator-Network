Claims: Dave Lee Travis, pictured arriving at Southwark Crown Court today, says he had to sell his house to fight assault allegations against him

Dave Lee Travis told a court he has a ‘cuddly nature’ but denied being a ‘sexual predator’.

Speaking from the witness box yesterday, the former Radio 1 DJ said he ‘loves women’ because they are ‘wonderful’ and have  ‘fabulous shapes’.

The 68-year-old said he did not have a predatory nature with women, but admitted he did ‘hug a lot of girls’.

‘If I like someone I will hug them and give them a kiss because the whole world needs that,’ he told the court.

‘Perhaps hugging is something which can be misconstrued by some people or if people are looking for an excuse they can say “he touched us”. I did hug a lot of girls.

‘But nowadays you can’t do that apparently … So it is an unfortunate trait I suppose.’

Travis described his colourful career as a ‘big name’ DJ at Radio 1 – but told Southwark Crown Court he could not do what he wanted.

Travis spoke of his passion for photography and admitted he has taken pictures of naked and semi-naked women for a book he published. But he insisted that the pictures were not ‘tacky’ and said he did not use his hobby to prey on women.

‘I love women,’ he told the jury. ‘I think they are wonderful.’

He added: ‘Women just have such fabulous shapes and I wanted to utilise those shapes.’

Among the allegations against him, Travis is accused of  sneaking into a Radio 4 studio and groping a presenter as she introduced Woman’s Hour live on air in the early 1980s.

Denying the attack, he said: ‘I would be at a bit of a loose end understanding it to be quite honest with you.’ He said he would have been hauled before a station boss if he had dared to interrupt a Radio 4 programme.

‘I agree I was a big name in Radio 1, but there were quite a few big names. You did not do what you wanted at the BBC,’ he said.

Years later he met the woman at a party where he took a photograph of her.

He
 said: ‘Everything seemed to be fine. That was a serious thing that in 
her mind had happened. Why would she suddenly be posing and smiling for 
me and for the camera?

‘I 
thought she was great, I thought she was fabulous, a really nice lady. 
That’s why I don’t get this. On the rare occasions I met her, I thought 
she was superb.’

Denial: Travis said that although he loves women's 'shapes' he is not a sexual predator

Travis, 
who is being tried under his real name of Dave Patrick Griffin, was also
 questioned over claims he pushed his hand up the skirt of a newsreader 
while he was working for Classic Gold radio station in the early 2000s. 
‘This is not something you would do if you are a normal human being,’ 
the DJ told the court.

‘It’s astonishing because I even thought, and I said to police, that she was wearing trousers.’

When
 asked about whether it had ever been suggested he had a reputation for 
being a ‘sexual predator’ at the station, he said: ‘No, no one said a 
thing about it.

‘You can’t sexually assault a woman and expect people would not say anything. I would fully expect to be kicked out.’

He
 added: ‘I’m sorry, but this is my reputation I have spent 50 years 
building up – I’m not going to let it all go to pot over something a kid
 made up.’

Travis insisted
 he left Classic Gold in 2002 due to disagreements over music selection,
 and not as a result of allegations of sexual assault.

Travis,
 of Mentmore, Buckinghamshire, denies 13 counts of indecent assault 
dating back to between 1976 and 2003, and one count of sexual assault in
 2008. The trial continues.

Dave Lee Travis cried himself to sleep after being accused of assaulting women and said the allegations had ruined his life and career, a court heard today.

The veteran DJ claimed he had been 'screwed backwards' by the claims, telling police his wife Marianne was ill with breast cancer at the time they emerged.

He also said he had been forced to sell his home to fight the allegations, which he said had been made up by his accusers in a bid to 'make money'.

Today jurors heard extracts from a police interview with Travis on September 18 last year, 10 months after he was first arrested.

'Mr Travis said that for 10 months he
 had lost his money, work, his health, he has had back and knee 
operations and had suffered stress,' said junior prosecutor Teresa Hay.

'Worse
 still, his wife had suffered breast cancer. She was through it now but 
stress is bad for someone who is going through that.

'This
 was costing him his job, his living and everything he has built up over
 50 years. For him these allegations don't stand up. He and his wife had
 suffered badly.'

He said his accuser was 'out to make money' and asked: 'Why wait 20 years until it comes out in one-sided press coverage?'

'This is just someone else who can smell money and is jumping into the game to see what they can get out of it,' he told police.

Ms Hay said Travis told police that 'he has been screwed 
backwards - he is selling his house to pay for solicitors and 
barristers.

'People might think he is a millionaire but his bank account is non-existent.

'His
 life has changed for the worse and he is full of anger. Even if he is 
acquitted he still won't be free. He has cried at night.'

The
 jury heard that Travis was questioned in relation to allegations that 
he groped a woman while dancing the Lambada at two British Airways 
parties in the early 1990s.

He
 told police he would provide musical entertainment at such parties, 
often wearing fancy dress, but could not remember those events in 
particular.

Asked about claims that he had told 
the woman she had 'won the keys to his room', he claimed it was not the 
type of thing he would say.

He went on: 'It is just because she saw a picture of me in the paper next to Jimmy Savile. It is nonsense.'

Travis
 also told police that he had 'great sympathy' with rape victims and had
 been involved in attempts to stop it in his work for children's 
charities.

'But he didn't see the similarity between this and grabbing a girl's bum in a dance,' Ms Hay said.

The
 court has previously heard claims that Travis molested a teenager at a 
Showaddywaddy concert and assaulted a woman in the BBC studio while 
broadcasting his Radio 1 show.

He
 is also accused of attacking a theatre worker in his dressing room 
while appearing in panto, stopping only when one of the Chuckle Brothers
 walked past.

Dave
 Lee Travis groped a journalist's bottom while they were playing a 
flight simulator game on his computer, a court heard today.

The
 German woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was visiting his 
home in Buckinghamshire to interview him about Beat Club, a TV show 
which he once presented.

She
 told jurors she was 'embarrassed and taken aback' by the DJ's 'sleazy' 
behaviour during the alleged incident in August 2005, which followed a 
90-minute interview.

Travis invited the woman to play his favourite game and stood behind her as she began to play, the court heard.

'That's when he put his hand on a 
shoulder, ran it down my back and rested it on the left cheek of my 
bum,' she said. 'It was an extremely uncomfortable moment.

'I was completely taken aback, it was just unexpected. I felt it was sleazy, there was absolutely no option for me than to move.

'I was rather embarrassed and I was embarrassed for him about this kind of behaviour, it was just so inappropriate.'

Star: The claims against Travis date back to the height of his fame as a DJ and presenter in the 1970s

The reporter said that after the incident she 'pretended it didn't happen', while Travis appeared 'sheepish'.

She asked Travis to give her a lift to the local train station, where she took a photograph of the pair together.

'I
 did feel it was a really embarrassing situation and it was, I guess an 
attempt to make light of the situation,' the woman told the court.

She said that the DJ 'pulled her towards him and we ended up standing cheek to cheek', adding: 'That's not the photograph I wanted.

'I have interviewed many, many famous people in my journalistic career and most of the time they are pleasant people.

'My only explanation was that he must have felt really sheepish about what happened.

'I think the situation was so awkward, it was obvious this elderly gentleman who I had never heard of before completely crossed the line. It must have been embarrassing for him.'

The alleged victim confided in her partner but did not complain about the incident, saying 'it would have been very difficult' to lodge an official complaint.

'For me the situation was so embarrassing, it was so strange, I didn't feel I wanted to complain to someone,' she said. 'I sometimes thought in retrospect it would have been the smarter or braver thing to do at the time.'

She eventually came forward after hearing of Travis' arrest in November 2012.

The trial continues.
