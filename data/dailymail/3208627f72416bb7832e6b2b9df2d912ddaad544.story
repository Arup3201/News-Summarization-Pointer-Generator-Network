West Brom manager Tony Pulis has made his opening moves in the transfer market by enquiring for Watford striker Troy Deeney.

The Baggies are interested in taking the 26-year-old, who has scored 69 goals in four-and-a-half years at Vicarage Road.

Pulis' move for the 26-year-old will add to speculation that top-goalscorer, Saido Berahino could leave the Hawthorns this month, with Liverpool and Tottenham both keen.

However, Pulis is facing competition from Swansea manager Garry Monk, who is also monitoring Deeney.

The Welsh club are in the market for a new centre-forward with Wilfried Bony set to join Manchester City this month. 

Meanwhile, Pulis has has insisted Berahino is a ‘pleasure to work with’ and that everybody at West Bromwich Albion wants him to stay beyond this transfer window.

Berahino raised eyebrows by failing to celebrate any of his four goals against Gateshead in the FA Cup, furthering speculation he desired a move away.

But Pulis said the England Under-21 striker had been the last one to leave every training session, staying behind with assistant David Kemp, and that work was being done to ensure he could perform without off-field distraction.

‘We’ve had no offers for Saido, he is scoring goals and is a pleasure to work with,’ said Pulis. ‘He has been last off the training ground every day, working with Kempy. He’s enjoyed what we’re trying to do.

‘We have to make sure he has a clear mind on the football pitch. I’ve had a chat with him and he’s been smashing. Yes for everybody we’d like to keep him.
