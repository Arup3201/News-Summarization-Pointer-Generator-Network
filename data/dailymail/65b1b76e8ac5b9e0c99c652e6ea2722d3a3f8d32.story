After eight months searching for her missing pooch, Christy Tripp had given up hope of ever cuddling Lily the Chihuahua again.

But in a Christmas miracle, the 33-year-old was last week reunited with her precious pup nearly two years after she disappeared.

'It’s pretty incredible to see that she's safe, happy and healthy,' Tripp said. 'This is honestly the best Christmas present my family could have ever received.'

Together at last! Christy Tripp, 33, has recently been reunited with her long-haired Chihuahua named 'Lily' who went missing on Easter Sunday last year

Lily, a long-haired Chihuahua, escaped from Tripp's Scottsdale, Arizona home in April 2012.

After searching 
through neighborhoods and putting up fliers for months, Tripp believed she would never see Lily again.

'At about eight months I thought she was gone for sure,' Tripp told KWTX. 'It was then when I decided to leave all memories of Lily behind.'

In August, Tripp got engaged and moved to Elm Mott in Texas.

Lily had become a distant memory when Tripp received a surprising email about a week ago.

Her dog's microchip company in Scottsdale told her a stranger found the pup roaming the streets and brought her in.

'Surreal!' Tripp had given up hope of finding Lily, so was shocked a local vet contacted her to say they'd found her pet dog

Overwhelmed with emotion, Tripp frantically made plans to fly Lily to Texas.

'Lily
couldn’t get cleared to fly in the cargo bay of the plane because she 
was too small and wouldn’t survive the altitude temperature during the 
flight,' Tripp said.

That's when Tripp’s former vet clinic reached out to the public through Facebook, asking if anyone flying to Texas could take Lily.

'A good Samaritan volunteered to carry Lily on their flight free of charge,' Tripp said.

Tripp and her family drove to DFW International Airport about a week ago to reunite with Lily, an experience she described as 'surreal'.
