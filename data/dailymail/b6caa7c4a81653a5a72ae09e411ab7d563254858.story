An angry punter punched a woman cashier at a bookies - just because he had lost a 50p bet that would have made him just £1.30, a court heard today.

John Eamer, 29, stood to win the tiny amount when he bet that Germany would beat Portugal by at least 2-0 in their Euro 2012 clash.

But after Portugal lost 1-0 he lashed out in rage across the counter of the Ladbroke’s betting shop in Gloucester on Sunday June 10.

Thug: John Eamer, who punched a woman cashier at a bookies, outside Cheltenham Magistrate's Court (left) and at the scene of the crime

This is the barbaric moment John Eamer, from Gloucester, punched a woman cashier in the face after being told he hadn't won his bet

The attack on the shocked cashier was
 captured on CCTV and when images of the incident were released by 
police, Eamer, of Gloucester, was arrested.

Eamer pleaded guilty to assaulting cashier Leanne Vallis by beating when he appeared at Cheltenham Magistrates Court today.

Sharon Jamaa, prosecuting, said Eamer
 had gone in to the bookies to claim what he thought was a winning 
ticket where he had bet 50p and would win £1.30.

'He spoke to the cashier and presented his slip but he was told that he had not won,' she went on.

'The cashier made a computer check on
 the handicap bet in which Germany had to win by more than one clear 
goal and explained why Eamer was not a winner.

'Eamer became aggressive and began to
 shout and swear and he was asked to leave. Without warning, he lunged 
over the counter and punched Ms Vallis twice in the face causing 
swelling and bruising.'

The attack happened in a branch of Ladbrokes, on Southgate Street in Gloucester

In a victim statement Leanne Vallis said in 14 years working in the bookmakers, nothing like it had never happened before.

'I was very upset and scared. It was so ridiculous over such a small bet,' she said.

Defending, Gemma Bond told the bench it had been an act of frustration.

'He bets regularly and knows what bets are needed to make winnings. He thought that the cashier was midleading him,' she said.

The magistrates adjourned the case 
for a probation service report on Eamer. They adjourned sentence till a 
later date and granted him bail.

A spokesman for Ladbrokes said: 'If 
the shop doesn’t have a screen, it’s usually a sign that it is generally
 quite safe and has few security incidents.'

The company stressed that attacks in its betting shops remained extremely rare.

The Ladbrokes spokesman said: 
'Incidents like this are always distressing for those involved but we 
have excellent security procedures and the best CCTV in the business, 
the images from which we are using to assist the police with their 
enquiries.'
