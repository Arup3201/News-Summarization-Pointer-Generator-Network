Former Tinder employee, Whitney Wolfe, who sued the company for sexual harassment and workplace discrimination in July, is launching a new mobile dating app to compete with her previous employer.

Bumble, which is 'coming soon', promises to be safer and more respectful than Tinder, which it believes is full of 'creepy guys' and 'cheesy pickup lines.'

Described on its Facebook page as 'everything you've always wanted from a social discovery app with none of the things you don't,' it promises to provide suggested matches 'based on more relevant signals than other, more shallow apps.'

Bumble also claims that 'you'll never get unwanted messages'.

Like Tinder, Bumble uses Facebook to connect users with potential love matches and lets them easily give a thumbs-up or thumbs-down to the suggested suitor. 

But profiles must include more biographical information, like occupation, how old a person is, and where he or she went to college.

But Bumble isn't the only dating app touting themselves to be different.

Just last week new dating The Grade said women were 'unhappy with the quality of low-quality daters and the frequency of inappropriate, hostile and sexually suggestive messages.'

So it launched an algorithm to assign letter grades to users based on their popularity, the quality and tastefulness of their messages  and how responsive they are.

And new dating app Mesh also promises the same protections, siphoning messages with 'vulgarity, text-speak, poor grammar/spelling, and copy-and-pasted messages' into a 'Mismatch folder'.

According to TechCrunch, Miss Wolfe has joined forces with two other Tinder employees, Chris Gulczynski and his partner Sarah Mick, to launch Bumble.

Following the sexual harassment suit filed by Miss Wolfe (who was Tinder's  vice president of marketing), Tinder announced plans to replace CEO Sean Rad earlier this month.
