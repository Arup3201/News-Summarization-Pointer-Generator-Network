A Colombian military cook is being investigated after he was seen taking a bath in a cauldron used to make soup for troops.

Victor Gamboa, 27, was caught by a fellow chef as he stripped off and got into the huge vat before starting to wash his hair and body.

The incident took place in Bogota last July, but the news of Mr Gamboa's unusual choice of bathtub only reached top brass this week after pictures were leaked online.

Disgusting: Victor Gamboa, 27, was caught on camera as he stripped off to take a bath, washing his 'hair, feet and genitals' in a military soup cauldron at a base in Bogota, Colombia

Gamboa, who serves in the Colombian Military Police Battalion in the Colombian capital was snapped in the kitchen at the base, stripping off and climbing into the huge vat of water.

Sous chef Juan Camargo Cubillos, 24, said Gamboa then took a bottle of shampoo and began washing his hair before turning to the rest of his body.

'He was dressed in his uniform but then took it off and climbed into the vat of water which is used everyday to make soup,' Mr Cubillos told a local newspaper.

'First he washed his hair and then started doing his feet and genitals.

'It was completely grotesque and I couldn't believe what I was seeing.

'But when I asked him what the hell he was doing he just laughed and said I shouldn't worry about it.'

Mr Cubillos says the incident in July last year was hushed up  and that he was told to delete all photos, but they have now emerged on the internet.

Base commander General Raul Antonio Rodriguez said: 'It's illogical for a soldier to do this because the cauldrons are lit for 18-hours-a-day at high temperatures.

'It looks like it all happened in July 2014 when the place was shut after an order from the Health Secretariat.

'But everything is under investigation and if disciplinary measures are needed, they will be applied immediately.'
