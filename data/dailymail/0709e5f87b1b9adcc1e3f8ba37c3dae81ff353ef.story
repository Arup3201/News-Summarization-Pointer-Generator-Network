A judge has reinstated Katherine Jackson as the guardian of Michael Jackson's three children today in an arrangement that also keeps their cousin as temporary co-guardian.

Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff said during a hearing that an investigator who looked into the children's care found that the late pop star's 82-year-old mother was an excellent guardian and the children love her very much.

'I think the kids are in terrific hands,' the judge said. 'It appears from the report that Katherine Jackson has done a wonderful job and cares about the children very much.'

Beckloff noted that the children, 
Prince, 15, Paris, 14 and Blanket, 10, also have a close relationship 
with their 34-year-old cousin TJ Jackson, who was named co-guardian 
after working closely with Katherine Jackson since Michael Jackson died.

TJ is 'incredibly respectful' of the family matriarch and she is respectful of him, the judge said.

Beckloff said he will finalise the 
arrangement later in the month but for now he will issue letters of 
co-guardianship allowing both Jacksons to make decisions about the 
children's welfare.

The shared guardianship plan is 
apparently designed to remove pressure from Katherine Jackson who was 
previously named in her son's will as the children's sole guardian.

Perry Sanders Jr., her lawyer, has 
said the arrangement will allow his client to focus on the children's 
upbringing and not on home or logistics issues.

TJ Jackson was appointed temporary 
guardian in a court hearing last week after a bizarre episode in which 
Katherine Jackson was reported missing but later turned up at an Arizona
spa with family members.

Beckloff said last week that he 
didn't believe Jackson had done anything wrong but suspended her 
guardianship duties because she had been out of contact with her 
grandchildren for 10 days.

The changes in guardianship come on 
the heels of family dissension over Michael Jackson's will, which left 
nothing to his siblings when he died three years ago.

Family war: Jermaine, Janet and Randy Jackson were some of the family members involved in a plot to challenge the will of their late brother Michael, although Jermaine has now withdrew his support

Several of them signed a letter that 
was leaked to the media alleging the will was a fake and calling on 
executors of the estate to resign.

The dispute at one point led to a 
driveway confrontation involving several family members at the Calabasas
mansion where Katherine Jackson and the children have been living.

Close: Michael appointed Diana Ross as the back up guardian for his three children in the event of his death so she has to sign off custody arrangements

On Wednesday, Jermaine Jackson issued a plea for peace in the family and withdrew his support of the letter.

'Mistakes have been made and 
irrational things have been said on both sides in a highly charged 
emotional environment,' Jermaine Jackson wrote. 'It is time for us all 
to draw a line in the sand and move toward peace, co-operation, love and
healing.'

He wrote that the family is still raw
from Michael Jackson's death, and his mother has endured incredible 
stress and pressures since then.

Another party to the Jackson family 
drama, singer Diana Ross, who was named by Michael Jackson in his will 
as a potential guardian of the children if Katherine Jackson was not 
available, issued a statement saying the recent turmoil is a private 
matter and shouldn't be playing out publicly.

Ross and Jackson were longtime 
friends before his death in 2009. She has been given notice of court 
proceedings, but the new agreement apparently will relieve her of any 
possible guardianship duties, specifying that Katherine and TJ Jackson 
could replace each other if one or the other became unavailable to 
serve.

Addressing his fans: Jermaine posted the statement on his Twitter page this week, a day after he wrote that his family 'would heal'
