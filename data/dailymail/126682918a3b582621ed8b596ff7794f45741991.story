A calendar featuring British mothers who have overcome domestic violence, eating disorders and serious illness has been released to celebrate the country's most inspiring women.

The Woman of Strength 2014 calendar pictures females from up and down the country whose stories are a testament to the power of motherly love.

Among the entrants is a woman who had the bravery to take her daughter away from a violent partner and start a new life as a single-mum.

Another battled breast cancer at the same time as raising a daughter with sickle cell anaemia.

One mother has faced the emotional strain of caring for a son who is autistic while as well as a daughter who was diagnosed with leukaemia.

The creator of the calendar, Dawn Cousins, 39, is former foster child who is now a single mother of four.

She said the calendar is a celebration of the real women in Britain who put their troubles aside for the sake of their children.

Miss Cousins, from Harrow, London, said: 'It's the same in Africa - mothers with HIV and AIDS still strive to give their children the best standard of living they can.

'These are women who didn't expect the 
circumstances life handed to them. Their lives changed dramatically and 
it would have been so easy to give up - instead they've carried on 
fighting'

To find Britain's most inspiring 
mothers, Miss Cousins contacted disability charities and
 domestic violence support groups and received suggestions through word of 
mouth.

She features in 
the calendar as Miss November. After being abandoned at birth, Dawn was 
snatched away from her white foster parents after social services felt 
she would be better off with a black family.

Today,
 she works as a catering assistant and is a single mum to four children,
 twins Amber and Ryan, 14, Yasmin, 18 and Sapphia, 20.

Miss June Sian Galpin, 26 and daughter Shakira, 9 . Sian, from London, escaped an abusive ex-partner to start a new life with her daughter

She said: 'I was abandoned at birth and lived on hand-outs from Barnardo's.

'As a teenager I was in and out of children's homes and I knew I wanted to make something of my life. I want my daughters to have a positive female role model and know that I'll always be there for them.'

Like Dawn, the other Women of Strength have also fought against the tragedies life has thrown at them.

Miss
 February, Cheryl Alba, 35 is raising two children, Carlo, 10 and 
Chanelle, 5. Carlo is autistic and Chanelle was diagnosed with leukaemia
 two years ago.

Miss Alba 
said: 'My world turned upside down when they were diagnosed, but I have 
to be strong despite the pain I see in their eyes. My son is improving 
every day and Chanelle has finished her chemotherapy now.'

Miss
 March, Hannah Stuart, 51, is another mother who has seen her child 
suffer when her daughter Cherelle, 27, was diagnosed with sickle cell 
anaemia as a baby.

Miss August is Berna Grant. Berna, 65, from Harrow, London, has been a foster carer for 22 years and looked after more than 150 children

Miss September Joanne Price, 43, and son David, 8. Joanne, who lives with rheumatoid arthritis and depression, takes her autistic son David to meet a hedgehog at the local library

Miss Stuart said: 'Cherelle has had 5 
mini-strokes and they've narrowed the arteries on both sides of her 
brain. She has to have blood transfusions every three weeks because her 
brain can't survive without the blood.'

Last
 year, to compound their troubles, Miss March was also diagnosed with 
breast cancer. She is now in remission and her daughter is currently 
caring for her.

Also telling
 her story is Miss October, Jessica Campbell, 34, a woman who overcame a
 serious eating disorder to give birth to a healthy son, Maximus, 2.

She said: 'I was bulimic and depressed from the age of 16. I never thought I could raise a child because I was too selfish.

'I found gaining weight difficult during my pregnancy but this little person inside me had to come first. He was my life and he saved me from bulimia.'

Miss Cousins hopes that the calendar will raise funds for mothers like Miss December, Denise, a HIV Positive single mum from Cape Town, South Africa.

After receiving medical help and counselling at a Mothers 2 Mothers clinic, Denise gave birth to a healthy baby girl in 2005.

'I was overwhelmed by the support at the clinic and the charity helped me throughout my pregnancy. I gave birth to a baby girl who was born HIV negative.

'I'm pregnant again and because of Mothers 2 Mothers, my new baby boy will be healthy too.'

In a show of solidarity with women all over the world, the proceeds will go to families suffering from AIDS in Africa.
