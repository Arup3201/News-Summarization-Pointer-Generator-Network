As the writer half of the Two Ronnies, he was famous for his meticulous word play and brilliant punchlines.

And Ronnie Barker didn’t stop at his own work – a recent discovery shows that he even took his pen to the limericks of celebrated poet and artist Edward Lear.

In his copy of Lear’s Book Of Nonsense, Barker has crossed out the last lines of a series of verses and replaced them with his own version.

Great minds don't always think alike: Ronnie Barker (left) crossed out lines from the limericks of Edward Lear (right) to 'improve' them

Amendments: The book (left) includes Ronnie Barker's limerick (right), dated November 2001, which explains why he improved Lear's poems

The 19th century author of The Owl And
The Pussycat wrote limericks using the same word at the end of the 
first and last lines – to Barker’s obvious frustration.

He wrote at the start of the book: 
‘There was an old fossil named Lear, Who’s [sic] verses were boring and 
drear, His last lines were worse, just the same as the first! So I’ve 
tried to improve on them here.’

Rival in rhyme: Edward Lear, who died in 1888

The book, signed by Barker, is up for 
auction with a guide price of £1,500. He is thought to have made his 
amendments in 2001, four years before his death at 76.

Other limericks he changed included: 
‘There was a Young Lady of Turkey, who wept when the weather was murky; 
When the day turned out fine, she ceased to repine, That capricious 
Young Lady of Turkey.’ Barker replaced the last line with: ‘In fact, she
became rather perky.’

He did the same with: ‘There was an 
Old Man of the Dee, who was sadly annoyed by a flea; When he said, “I 
will scratch it”, they gave him a hatchet, Which grieved that Old Man of
the Dee.’ Barker changed it to: ‘And he cut his leg off at the knee’ – 
which also fitted Lear’s illustration of a man wielding a hatchet next 
to a man’s leg. However Barker, described by Ronnie Corbett as a ‘master
of the English language’, could not always find inspiration and next to
the limerick ‘There was an old Man of the South’, he wrote simply: 
‘Impossible – no further rhymes.’

By the end he’d clearly had enough 
because he changed the final verse to read: ‘There was a Young Lady of 
Clare, who was sadly pursued by a bear; When she found she was tired, 
she abruptly expired, And so do these rhymes – in despair!’

The book was found by chance among a 
job lot bought by collector John Watts, 40, of Taunton, Somerset. It 
will be auctioned at the Dominic Winter saleroom near Cirencester, 
Gloucestershire, on June 21.

Changes: Barker's revision of 'There Was An Old Man With A Beard'

Scribble: Barker wrote an alternative ending to 'There Was An Old Man Of The Dee'

Notes: 'There Was An Old Person of Ischia' is one of more than 100 limericks revised by Barker

Widely considered to be the creator of nonsense verse, Edward Lear was also an accomplished author, artist and illustrator.

He
was born into a middle-class family in Holloway, London, in 1812, but 
suffered ill health - including epileptic seizures - from childhood.

Lear travelled widely throughout his life and eventually settled in Sanremo, Italy, where his body is buried.

He
briefly gave drawing lessons to Queen Victoria, and he journeyed to 
Italy, Greece, Egypt, India and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) to perfect his 
art.

He helped popularise the limerick when he published A Book of Nonsense in 1846. There were three editions.

His most famous nonsense work, The Owl and the Pussycat, was published in 1867.

Lear died in 1888.

A spokesman for the saleroom said: ‘If
one had to name Ronnie Barker’s comedy ancestors then the name of 
Edward Lear would surely feature.

'Both were masters of comic word play.’

But he added: ‘To modern day readers 
such as Barker’s generation and ours, the limerick form has to end with a
funny punchline in the fifth brand new line.

‘What struck Barker as odd was that 
Lear used the same rhyming word as the first line, making the limerick 
an anti-climax of non-humour.

‘I think Lear’s more nonsensical 
treatment of the limerick form he invented was deliberate rather than 
second-rate.

'They were, after all, published in his “Book Of Nonsense”.’

Lear’s book, however, did contain at 
least one limerick of which Barker approved, and commented next to it: 
‘This is the first one I have ever seen that didn’t use the same word!’

The acceptable limerick goes: ‘There 
was an Old Man who supposed, that the street door was partially closed; 
But some very large rats, ate his coats and his hats, While that futile 
old gentleman dozed.’

Barker approved of this poem, and wrote: 'This is the first one I have ever seen that didn't use the same word!'

Crossed out: Barker amended the final line of 'There Was An Old Person Of Bangor'
