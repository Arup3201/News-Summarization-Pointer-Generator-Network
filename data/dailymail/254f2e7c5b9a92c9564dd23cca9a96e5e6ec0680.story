Revolting French farmers dumped hundreds of tonnes of manure and rotten vegetables on the streets as well as spraying a council water treatment office with slurry in a major day of protest.

Members of the French Farmers Union (FNSEA) and the Young Farmers Union (YA) held demonstrations over worsening food prices as well as increases in the cost of fertiliser. 

Farmers complain that sanctions with Russia over the ongoing Ukrainian crisis has led to collapse in the price of cereal, milk and grain.

During one protest in Chatres, south west of Paris, farmers dumped 100 tonnes of manure along with rotting vegetables outside the offices of the agriculture department as well as the town hall.

Around 300 farmers using 30 tractors took part in the protest. 

Union leader Jean Michel Gouache said his members were 'fed up' over 'increasingly crazy constraints and charges'.  

A group of more than 300 farmers dumped around 100 tonnes of manure and rotten vegetables in the centre of Chartres on Tuesday in protest at falling food prices.

In central Paris, farmers unloaded 50 tonnes of fruit and vegetables at the Place de la Republique in Paris and gave them away for free. 

Damien Greffin, of the FNSEA union in Paris said: 'Clearly we are expressing our annoyance, and the annoyance
of the entire farming world. 

'Today, a farmer devotes most of his time to administration
and paperwork rather than production to feed the population, and
this is completely unacceptable.'

Wednesday's day of action called by the FNSEA brought around
36,000 farmers out onto the streets across France, accompanied
by hundreds of tractors, the union said.

Farmer frustration over red tape and a deteriorating
economic outlook has led to more than 150 protests around the
country since late August, the FNSEA said.

In an extreme case, vegetable growers in Brittany set fire
to public buildings in September.

The government has condemned such violent incidents but has
also tried to address farmer grievances at a time when unpopular
Socialist President Francois Hollande is facing discontent due
to a struggling economy.

Several major French towns were brought to a standstill as farmers complained over government policy

Anger has notably built up following controversy over a dam
project in the southwest designed to allow irrigation for farms
and over environmental rules after the government extended a
list of water protection zones to limit nitrate pollution.

An environmental protester died last month during clashes
with police at the site of the planned reservoir, where work has
since been suspended by the local authorities.

In several towns, farmers used tractors to dump livestock
manure outside local government buildings, displaying slogans
like 'Too much biodiversity is harmful'.

The FNSEA is also calling for French farm produce to be
given a bigger place in the country's canteens and restaurants,
supported by an 'Eat French' slogan.

French farmers complain that their income is being slashed by falling food prices and rising costs 

As part of Wednesday's action, farmers carrying out checks
on lorries delivering food to the French finance ministry said
they had found Moroccan tomatoes and Italian apples.

In Paris, passers-by expressed support for French produce.

One passer-by said: 'If everyone made the effort and paid a little bit more,
they could eat quality food and get the French economy moving
again, and I think we really need that.'

Agriculture Minister Stephane Le Foll, regularly criticised
by farmer groups for advocating environment-friendly practices,
said after a weekly cabinet meeting that farmers' discontent was 'justified'.

To offer short-term relief for farmers, the government
announced last month the early payment of some annual EU
subsidies.

It is also trying to find alternative export markets to
Russia. Le Foll requested last week during a visit to Tunisia
that the north African state authorise the import of French
apples.

Farmers built dozens of barricades with stray, wood and old tyres which were later ignited 

The protesters want an end to sanctions with Russia which they claim are hitting crop prices
