Jochemus Venter (pictured outside court in December 2013) was jailed for the scam and has now been struck off by the General Dental Council

A fiddling dentist has been struck off for cheating the NHS out of £48,000 of work on bogus patients and treatment he never carried out.

Jochemus Venter, 56, put in bills for non-existent treatment on more than 100 patients in a four-year fraud spree.

He charged the NHS £300 for crowns when all he did was fillings - and up to £1,200 for orthodontic work which was never done.

His dental fraud was exposed by two 'whistle-blowing' staff who reported his scam to police.

South African-born Venter has already been jailed for 18 months for false accounting for a total of £47,947 at his surgery in Llandrindod Wells, Powys.

Now he has been struck off by the General Dental Council (GDC) who ruled he 'breached the need for a dentist to be honest and trustworthy at all times.'

A spokesman for the GCC said: 'Public trust and confidence in the profession, and in the regulatory process, would be damaged if a finding of impairment were not made.

'Furthermore, the committee considers that dishonesty on this scale over a four-year period is not remediable.

'In the words of the sentencing judge, "this was a deliberate, concerned and sophisticated fraud".

'Accordingly, the committee has determined that the appropriate and proportionate sanction in this case is that of erasure.'

In total, Venter made 211 fraudulent claims for bogus dental work on more than 100 patients

Cardiff Crown Court heard that he would charge up to £40 for a sports mouth guard and then put in a £1,200 bill for orthodontic work.

The court heard that father-of-three Venter was a school governor and the well-respected only dentist in the Wales town of Llandrindod Wells.

He had sold the practice in 2008 to a dental company - but continued working there doing mainly NHS work.

The NHS fraud service was finally alerted to Venter's scheme after concerns were voiced by the dental nurse and receptionist at the practice.

Sentencing Venter to 18 months in prison, Judge Tom Crowther told him: 'This was a deliberate, concerted and sophisticated fraud over four years driven by greed.'

NHS fraud service spokesman Mark Weston said afterwards: 'He was a highly paid professional but was greedy for more.

'The sentencing demonstrates that crime against NHS Wales will not be tolerated.'

Mr Weston said the NHS had already recovered the £47,900 under the Proceeds of Crime Act.
