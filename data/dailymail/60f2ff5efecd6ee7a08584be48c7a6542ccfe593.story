The world’s media reacted with shock and horror to the riots that have swept Britain, with London portrayed as ‘a lawless city’.

The story made front pages around the globe, and was among the top items on TV news shows in dozens of countries.

Germany led the way, with Der Spiegel magazine comparing London to the capital of Somalia.

Burning down: Several foreign governments have started issuing advice to their citizens thinking about visiting the UK

‘The television images dominating screens this week could be right out of Mogadishu,’ it wrote.

‘As difficult to imagine as it might be, the pictures aren’t from Somalia, but from London, right in  the centre of Europe. And they will never be forgotten.’

In newspapers, TZ in Munich asked: ‘What has gone wrong with Britain? Like the Sex Pistols said, it truly is anarchy in the UK.’

The tabloid Bild summed up the feelings of many with the headline: ‘Chaos reigns in London!’ On its website, other stories were titled ‘England in flames’ and ‘London’s night of horror’.

Many looked ahead to next summer, with the respected Süddeutsche Zeitung warning that ‘fears are concentrated on the Olympics’.

Countries including Canada and Australia were left stunned that the kind of unrest seen in Greece and France had befallen Britain.

In the U.S., cars burning across the English capital featured prominently even as Washington and Wall Street struggled amid the  debt crisis.

The New York Times called the riots ‘the worst outbreak of social unrest in Britain in 25 years’.

Online, the Huffington Post news website ran the headline ‘London’s Burning’ while one contributor to the venerable Wall Street Journal wrote: ‘These people are welcome to march and protest, but when they start robbing and destroying others’ property then I’m all for declaring them targets for target practice.’

An editorial in Le Monde, one of France’s leading newspapers, said the UK was asking itself: ‘How to put an end to the destruction, which has in three days devastated whole neighbourhoods in London and its suburbs, as well as the cities of Birmingham, Bristol and Liverpool?’

The riots also led every TV bulletin  in Spain, with laSexta describing ‘a  lawless city’.

The Coalition Government’s response came
in for criticism as well, following the belated decisions of senior 
politicians – including Prime Minister David Cameron – to return from 
their holidays.

Yesterday, it was announced that Parliament would be recalled tomorrow from its summer recess.

The Spanish newspaper El País said: ‘Far from reacting quickly, the Government was missing during the crucial hours and has responded with a vagueness which has failed to calm  the violence.

Cameron’s credibility  has suffered a new reverse in these  days of fury.’ 

El Mundo blamed the riots on an unintegrated immigrant population living  in poverty.

Warning: The editor of India's Lonely Planet magazine Vardhan Kondvikar told his Twitter followers to avoid coming to the UK at all

It said: ‘That is why the British authorities – in fact, you could say all of 
Europe – should bend over backwards to stop these violent outbreaks 
which, if they get worse, would have unforeseeable consequences.’

Demonstrating the extent of the devastation, newspapers in Syria compared  the situation to trouble within its  own borders.
