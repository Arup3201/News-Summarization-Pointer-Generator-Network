Clint Eastwood wowed Republicans with a sardonic, humourous routine on the convention stage in which he interrogated an imaginary Barack Obama  and then declared: 'Politicians are employees of ours...When somebody does not do the job we’ve gotta let them go.'

At 82, the Hollywood movie star, director and former mayor of Carmel, California showed he still had an actor’s sense of timing and a wry wit.

Recalling the 2008 election, he said: ‘I just thought this was great. Everyone was crying. Oprah was crying . Even I was crying.'

But three and a half years later, he said, there were 23 million unemployed. 'That is something to cry for. That is a disgrace. A national disgrace.'

Bring in the balloons: Mitt Romney was first joined on stage by his wife Ann, Paul and Janna Ryan

Talking to the imaginary Obama, he said: ‘Possibly now it may be time for someone else to come along and solve the problem.'

He then mocked him for promising to close Guantanamo Bay and then changing his mind and for having 'the stupid idea of trying terrorists in downtown New York city.'

There were guffaws as he told the phantom president: ‘I’m not going to shut up - it's my turn…I can’t tell him [Romney] to do that. He can’t do that to himself.'

Minutes later, a quick viewer created
 a Twitter account called 'InvisibleObama' with the biography field 
filled simply with the description 'Stage left of Clint Eastwood'.

Showing his allegiance: Eastwood has publicly talked about his Republicanism in the past, and first dabbled in politics as the mayor of Carmel, California

Within ten minutes, the account had over 4,700 followers.

Beyond the jokes, Eastwood did include a
 slightly more serious message, criticizing the high unemployment rate 
under Obama, and the war in Afghanistan.

He assured the crowd that while it 
may seem like Hollywood is filled solely with Democrats, that is not the
 case.

Instead, he said that it was just the modesty of Republicans that
 keep them out of the spotlight.

'Conservative people by the nature of
 the word itself, play a little closer to the vest they just don't go 
around hot dogging it,' Eastwood said.

Comedic chops: For much of the short speech, he had a fake conversation with the empty chair next to him, pretending that Mr Obama was sitting next to him

He went on to give Jon Voight a shout out, as the Academy Award winning actor has been working the convention floor for days.

Eastwood spoke quietly and his address, made without notes or a teleprompter, brought down the energy level of the evening after a series of upbeat videos and testimonials from those who know Romney best and before Senator Marco Rubio, 41, of Florida, one of the party’s new generations of stars.

Describing Romney as 'a stellar businessman' Eastwood said: 'When somebody does not do the job we've gotta let them go... We don’t have to be masochists and vote for someone we don't like just because they seem to be nice.'

Responding to shouts from the crowd of 'Make my day' - his 'Dirty Harry' catchphrase - he ended by saying: 'I'll start it, you finish it. Go ahead...'

And the crowd roared: 'Make my day!'

There had been earlier speculation that the 'mystery guest' could be Sarah Palin, Colin Powell or even a hologram of Ronald Reagan.

But Republican sources then confirmed that Eastwood would be the surprise new gunslinger in town for Romney.

The news that Eastwood, mayor of Carmel from 1986 to 1988, is the man who could make Romney's day produced a frisson of excitement among delegates eager to see the "Dirty Harry” star and Oscar-winning director of Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby.

Eastwood has kept a low political profile in recent years, but came under fire in February when he appeared in a Chrysler Super Bowl ad that declared: 'It's halftime in America.'

Republican pundits blasted Eastwood, saying that the Gran Torino star was sticking up for Obama's auto industry bailout.

Eastwood has had a low profile politically in recent years but backed Sen John McCain in 2008, and endorsed Mitt Romney earlier this month at a fundraiser in Sun Valley, California.

'Now more than ever do we need Mitt 
Romney, I'm going to be voting for him,’ the Oscar winner said as the 
Romney stood next to him, beaming, on August 4.
