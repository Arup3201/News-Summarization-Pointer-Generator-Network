Police are investigating a nursing home following complaints that elderly residents have been bruised, left filthy and robbed.

Officials launched a probe into the operation of 64-bed Honeymead Care Home after families of two residents reported bruises on their loved ones’ skin and poor levels of hygiene.

They are also scrutinising allegations that jewellery, including rings and necklaces, was stolen from residents at the £595-a-week care facility in Bedminster, Bristol.

Bruises while in care: Resident Violet Hare's relatives made complaints about Honeymead Care Home after the 97-year-old with dementia was found with bruises on her arm

Avon and Somerset Police confirmed today that they had launched an investigation into the allegations and promised to take them ‘extremely seriously’.

A police spokesman said: ‘Officers from our Public Protection Unit are aware of these incidents and full investigations are underway to establish if any criminal offences have been committed.

‘We are working closely with our partners in the safeguarding team at Bristol City Council.

‘We take all reports of this nature extremely seriously and are committed to keeping all of our residents safe, particularly the elderly or vulnerable.’

Resident Violet Hare, 97, who has dementia, was found with bruising on her arm.

Jewellery stolen: While in the care of Honeymeed, Mrs Hare's (pictured) wedding ring, which she has worn for 70 years, has gone missing

Concerned staff at the home even reported this themselves to police and the council. They took pictures of her injuries and gave them to her family.

Mrs Hare’s niece Lyn Caple also reported to police in April that her aunt’s wedding ring, which she had worn for 70 years, was missing. Other missing items such as underwear and a hospital bag were also reported to the home’s management.

Living at the nursing home since 2009, Mrs Hare's niece is reluctant to move her.

Ms Caple said: ‘I don’t want to move her out of the care home because I’m concerned about the impact it will have on her at her age. I just hope things improve.’

The family of resident Olive Bewick decided to move her to a different care home after she was found with bruising on her shins.

Taking it seriously: The nursing home regulator made an inspection last week and Mimosa, the company which runs the home, said they are saddened and disappointed by the complaints and is taking them seriously

Mrs Bewick had lived at Honeymead for five years until, over the last four months, her family became so concerned about her care that they complained to management.

Her granddaughter Julie Ryall, 38, said: ‘We noticed things with her personal hygiene. Her nails were absolutely filthy, but she is either in bed or a wheelchair, so it’s not like she was doing gardening.

‘We also noticed dried food on her face where they had not washed it after meals. We also noticed bruising to her legs.’

Mrs Ryall said she and sister Cheralyn Greenaway became worried last week after they discovered that their grandfather’s wedding ring and their grandmother’s necklace were missing.

She said: ‘We looked for her necklace and could not find it and went straight to the manager and saw the Care Quality Commission inspector there so we reported it to them.’

The Care Quality Commission carried out 
an inspection at the home last week and the report is due to be issued 
within several weeks. The regulator has been in meetings with the local 
council over the allegations.

Too old to relocate: Even though Mrs Hare has suffered bruises to her arm, her relatives are reluctant to relocate her because they worry she is too old to cope with such a move

A spokesman for Mimosa, which runs Honeymead Care Home, said the company was saddened and disappointed by the complaints and was taking them very seriously.

She said: ‘Several of the allegations made are now subject to a police investigation and the management and staff of Honeymead is fully co-operating with this investigation.

‘As a consequence at such an early stage of the police investigation it is not appropriate to make any further comment on the specifics of the allegations until the police enquiries are complete.

‘Mimosa is also saddened and disappointed to note the complaints made by the family of Mrs Bewick with regard to the standards of food and hygiene at Honeymead.

‘Again, we take these complaints very seriously and have launched an internal investigation with regard to the concerns expressed by the Bewick family.’

Bristol City Council is monitoring the quality of care by the home, a spokeswoman confirmed.

She said: In both cases the council has used the safeguarding adults procedures to work with the police and care home to investigate the concerns.

‘The quality of services is a key priority for the council and we are working with Honeymead to ensure improvements, and monitor the overall quality of care given by the home.’
