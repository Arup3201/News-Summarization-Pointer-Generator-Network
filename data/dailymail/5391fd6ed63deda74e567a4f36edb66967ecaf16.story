A teenaged robber is dead after a Washington, DC stickup went wrong and left him the victim of a sawed-off shotgun blast.

Channel Johnson, 18, approached a man on a Southeast street on Wednesday and announced it was a robbery, say police.

However, his 22-year-old target managed to wrest the gun away from Johnson and apparently fired.

The teen was rushed to the hospital in what authorities told the Washington Post was grave condition.

According to MyFoxDC, the 22-year-old remained at the scene and cooperated with police.

The teen later died from his injuries. 

Police were not expected to file charges.

Police say the 22-year-old man stayed at the scene and cooperated. It is being investigated as a death and not, apparently, a crime of any kind

The incident was one of four shootings reported in the nation's capital on Wednesday alone.

Another was part of what police are investigating as an aggravated assault but were unsure, according to WUSA, whether someone was actually hit by a bullet.

A third potentially related incident occurred just outside the Anacostia Metro stop. A victim was breathing and conscious when paramedics took him away.

Police are searching for three black men, one of whom may have worn a mask, in the second two shootings.

A fourth shooting appeared to be unrelated and involved a man at Alabama Avenue and 22nd who was also taken to the hospital alive.
