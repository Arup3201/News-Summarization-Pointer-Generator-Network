It became one of the most infamous resignations of recent times and catapulted an air steward to worldwide stardom.

But a year after Steven Slater swore at a passenger, grabbed some beers and jumped down a plane's emergency chute, he maintains in an interview that he would not change a thing.

This is despite being unable to find a job, the criminal conviction that followed  the incident at New York's JFK airport and lurid headlines about his sex life which included the revelation that he is HIV positive.

No regrets: Steven Slater before he quit in a storm at New York's JFK airport

In October 2010 Slater pleaded guilty to two counts of attempted criminal mischief, was forced to enter counselling and rehab, and was required to pay his former airline Jet Blue $10,000 in compensation.

He had flown off the handle on August 9 during a flight from Pittsburgh after asking a passenger not to remove her belongings from the overhead baggage compartment while the plane was still on the runway.

The woman reportedly swore at Slater and grabbed her case anyway, cutting the irate attendant on the forehead with the bag as he tried to intervene.

After the plane had stopped and the 100 passengers started shuffling to the exit, Slater's voice was allegedly heard bellowing over the loudspeaker.

'I've had it! To the passenger who called me a mother******, **** you! I've been in this business for 28 years and that's it. I'm done,' he said.

Then he grabbed his bags  -  and two cans of beer from the galley  -  and popped the lever for the plane's inflatable emergency chute.

With his bags in his lap he slid down to the tarmac, ran to pick up his silver Jeep Wrangler and drove off. An hour later police came to arrest him at his home, where he was in bed with his boyfriend.

'I don't believe in the word regret. It's too strong a word. It's my story. It's what happened. But I don't believe in trying to undo the past. It gave me the chance for the first time in my life to say "No",' he said in an interview with the Huffington Post.

'It gave me the chance to champion myself, to say enough is enough, to take care of myself, to take care of my loved ones, and those were the lessons that I needed to learn.

'I think that at that particular moment in time, most everyone could relate to where I was emotionally at the time.'

On the back of his meltdown the recovering alcoholic became a folk hero in America and abroad, and has 185,000 fans on Facebook.

...and there's a message on the back directed at the unnamed woman passenger who sparked the outburst

'Most everyone could relate to doing more with less, being outsourced, being downsized, taking care of aging parents, trying to take care of their children -- it was a familiar place that people could find resonance with. And I think a lot of people found a bit of themselves within me,' he said.

Mr Slater is still unemployed and admits he has struggled with the media interest in his life. He also misses his life as a steward but accepts that he will never work again in that industry.

He is now preparing a book charting his story, thought to be called 'Cabin Pressure'.
