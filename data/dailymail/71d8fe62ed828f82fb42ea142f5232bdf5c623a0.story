The great British pint will enter ‘terminal decline’ if new rises in beer tax are not scrapped, George Osborne is warned today.

The Chancellor is coming under growing pressure to use the Budget this month to abandon the ‘duty escalator’ which is due to impose another five per cent rise in tax on beer.

Campaigners claim the move would save 5,000 and could actually increase the amount of money the Treasury raises by £5million, because fewer pubs will go bust.

Continental drift: British drinks pay much more than other EU countries, according to the British Beer and Pub Association

The Labour government set up the escalator five years ago, and means beer tax rises by two per cent above inflation every year. Since March 2008, duty has risen by a staggering 42 per cent.

The British Beer and Pub Association points to studies which suggest freezing duty will increase the amount of tax Mr Osborne raises by keeping more people in work.

In its report Beer, Pubs and the Budget 2013, the BBPA warns beer and pubs in Britain are ‘over-taxed’, at levels higher than most other European countries.

The Treasury predicts it will raise less from beer duty in 2013-14 compared with the previous year, despite plans to increase the rate by more than five per cent.

Tory MP Andrew Griffiths told MailOnline: ‘The British brewing industry is in crisis.

‘The
hated beer tax escalator is killing brewers and closing down pubs. 
Unless future increases are scrapped now we could see the terminal 
decline of the great British pint.’

BBPA chief executive Brigid Simmons said: ‘UK beer drinkers now pay 40 per cent of the beer tax across the EU, but only consume 13 per cent of its beer.

‘A duty freeze would raise revenues, protect jobs, and help one of our greatest national assets — our much-loved pubs.’

Beer and pubs support 949,000 jobs in the UK, paying close to £13 billion in wages, according to research by Oxford Economics.

Almost 150 MPs from all parties have backed a Commons motion demanding a freeze in beer duty.

The Chancellor has faced calls from dozens of Tory MPs to do more to cut taxes and go further in removing red-tape for business in next month’s Budget.

Conservative MPs have grown increasingly anxious about the voter reaction to the state of the economy, and the impact on household budgets.

The demands include tax cuts on March 20 to boost growth, including reductions in duty on alcohol, petrol and air flights.

It is claimed a freeze in beer duty would save up to 10,000 jobs by the end of this Parliament.

British drinkers pay much more beer tax than other European countries.

Excise duty on a pint of lager in Britain is 55.4pence, compared with just 4.6pence in Spain.

The average price of a pint in Britain is £3.22 - almost double the Spanish average of £1.70 - of which 54pence is VAT and 55pence is excise duty.

The disparity means that if every fan had a pint before Manchester United take on Real Madrid at Old Trafford tomorrow, the tax paid would be £43,000 higher than if the game was taking place in the Spanish capital, according to the Sun.

Next round: Seven in 10 drinks bought in pubs are beer

Tax on booze has risen by 42 per cent since 2008, sparking warnings it is leading to the closure of pubs around the country.

Matthew
Sinclair, from the TaxPayers' Alliance, told the Sun: 'Spanish fans 
will be crying into the beer when they discover how much of the price of
their pint is tax.

'George Osborne should call time on the beer duty escalator.'
