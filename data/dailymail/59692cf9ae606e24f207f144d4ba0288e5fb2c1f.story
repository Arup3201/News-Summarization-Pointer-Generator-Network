A British sea captain was behind bars on a remote island in Papua New Guinea last night after being arrested in connection with the sinking of one of his ships last year, in which 162 people drowned.

Peter Sharp, originally from the Shetland Islands, was ordered to surrender his British passport before being locked up on the island of East New Britain where he has been charged with 162 counts of manslaughter by criminal negligence.

He was also charged with sending an unseaworthy vessel, the 259 ton Rabaul Queen, to sea, before it sank off the coast of Morobe Province in February last year.

Tragedy: 162 people drowned after the Rabaul Queen, owned by British national Peter Sharp, capsized off the coast of Morobe Province in February last year

Police said at the time that they did not know exactly how many people had died as it was believed there had been a number of children under the age of three on board whose names were not recorded on the ship's manifest.

Mr Sharp, 69, who has lived in Papua New Guinea for a number of years, was arrested after a prolonged police investigation and a Commission of Inquiry into the sinking of the vessel, owned by his company, Rabaul Shipping.

A four man police team, led by Detective Chief Inspector Ben Turi, arrived in East New Britain earlier this week and took Mr Sharp into custody.

Following a lengthy interview he was locked up in a police cell in the town of Kokono as his lawyer and family tried, unsuccessfully, to obtain bail for him.

The Commission of Inquiry found in September last year that the Rabaul Queen was not seaworthy, unsafe and should never have departed on its final voyage.

The commission found that weather and sea conditions at the time she ship capsized were gale force and it should not have been at sea.

The inquiry found that Mr Sharp had demonstrated that he had little or no respect for people, including those in authority.

Reports said that his 'gross disrespect' was reflected in the 'appalling and inhumane conditions' in which he was prepared to let passengers on the Rabaul Queen travel and might explain in part why he was prepared to compromise the safety of passengers on board his ships.

New Guinea Islands Divisional Commander Anton Billie said today that Mr Sharp was 'innocent until proven guilty and the matter is now before the courts.'
