A new study about forced labour in former communist East Germany shows how companies like Ikea, Siemens and Aldi profited enormously from the slave workers who toiled for them in grim factory jails.

Ikea has shelled out £100,000 on a warts-and-all look into the dark practice of selling items made in the totalitarian state's penal system after allegations about the practice surfaced two years ago.

The 500 page report was presented in Berlin on Monday.

Political scientist Christian Sachse, the author, said: 'The west knew these products were made by forced labour which was forbidden under international conventions.'

In 2012 Ikea had officially admitted that it had sold furniture which had been produced by prisoners of the German Democratic Republic, Soviet Russia's most hardline ally in the eastern bloc.

Shelves, sofas and a host of other home furnishings were churned out in their thousands by men and women imprisoned because of their opposition to the regime under which they lived.

Ikea was not alone. The study shows that a substantial portion of the West German 'economic miracle' came as a result of the slaves put to work in the east with 6,000 firms in all using them.

Others included engineering giant Krupp, telecommunications company Mannesmann and the oxygen manufacturer Linde.

The study says East Germany put some 15,000 prisoners to work making the products for which the state received much needed hard currency.

The Stasi secret police ran the slave programme.

The study says that cynical leaders in East Germany put prisoners to work from 1949 onwards - first in the steel mills and coal mines - and later in the factory prisons churning out the western consumer goods

Products from the GDR were attractive to the west because they were so much cheaper than those produced domestically.

The study says that cynical leaders in East Germany put prisoners to work from 1949 onwards - first in the steel mills and coal mines - and later in the factory prisons churning out the western consumer goods.

It also criticised the West German practice of paying cash for political prisoners to be released.

This, said the author, encouraged the regime to seize others, brand them as dissidents, and hold them to ransom too.

The author said; 'Political prisoners were themselves export goods.'

Roland Jahn, the head of the Stasi document service in Berlin, saiod forced labour in Eastern

German prisons, said: 'The dictatorship used prisoners in violation of human rights, who had to work under inhumane conditions.

'But it is also important to stress the responsibility of the Western companies.

'The companies must ask themselves whether this was too easy for them. Many western companies still don't know about their involvement in this slave labour programme and I would like them to show more interest in learning about it.'

Ikea says the results of the study have brought about a change in the company's corporate culture.

'Today we have a clear code of conduct,' said a spokesman.
