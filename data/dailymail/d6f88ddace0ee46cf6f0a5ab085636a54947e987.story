They may have a reputation for being slow and steady, but this turtle made a getaway from the jaws of a hungry tiger shark, bamboozling the predator by swimming in circles.

A rare video shows the clever reptile turning on its side to make itself too big for the shark's gaping mouth.

Confusing the shark further, the turtle swims in tight circles to help it escape from the killer animal.

The turtle swims closely to the shark, not allowing it to turn quickly enough, as it circles the predator, using its shell as a shield. 

The fascinating footage was shot off the Cocos Islands, near Costa Rica, by Randall Arouz.

Mr Arouz, from Florida, said: 'The turtles have to have certain strategies to avoid being eaten.

'Firstly, the shark will swim at it, mouth wide open horizontally and its teeth can puncture the shell.

To balance this, the turtle will turn on its side, creating a shield and making it too big for the jaws.

'Secondly, it stays near so the shark can't turn sharp enough to catch the turtle.'

Mr Arouz, president of Pretoma Marine Life Discovery, a Costa Rican conservation group, stumbled across the amazing moment while surveying the ocean around the islands. 

'It was really difficult to film as the water was really choppy,' he added.

'Also, we had to shoot the video blind from above the surface rather than getting in there with the animals.'
