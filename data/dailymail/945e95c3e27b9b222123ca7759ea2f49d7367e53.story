When twins Charlotte Eisgrou and Ann Primack were born Edward VII was still on the British throne, the South Pole still had not been conquered and the old age pension had only just been introduced.

But despite being the world's oldest living identical twins, the 103-year-olds are proud to say they still have all their 'faculties'.

The pair, who celebrated their birthday on Christmas Eve, also still have their own teeth, do not use a hearing aid and do not even need reading glasses.

The pair, who could not spend their big day together because they recently suffered falls, love to re-live the many practical jokes they have played over the years.

Mrs Primack, who lives in South Florida, said when she would visit her sister in Daytona Beach the pair would switch husbands as they walked into the local synagogue.

She told the Daytona Beach News Journal: 'And they'd say to me "Charlotte, you look so good."'

The twins' great age is even more remarkable as they were born premature, weighing a combined 7lbs.

The doctor kept them warm by wrapping them in hot blankets and placing them on the open door of a stove as it was before the days of incubators.

They were born in Chicago before moving to Florida where they both enjoyed long marriages and have one living son each.

The sisters have always been close and talk to one another almost daily but they do not agree on the secret behind their long life.

Mrs Primack credits genes and 'never being fat' while her twin Mrs Eisgrou said it is down to drinking lots of milk.

But Mrs Eisgrou, who admits to being the more outspoken of the two sisters, said: 'I don't know the secret to a long life. And I wouldn't tell you if I knew it.'

Despite their age Mrs Eisgrou said she did not plan a big birthday party but concedes their family would be happy to know they have lived so long.

She said: 'Who would have thunk it? My father would have danced in the air. He'd be so happy.'

They are the second oldest twins in the world, born 39 days after non-identical twins Edith Ritchie and Evelyn Middleton from Aberdeenshire, in Scotland.
