It was the iconic image that marked the start of some of Britain's classic 20th century movies including the Carry On films, The Red Shoes and A Matter Of Life And Death.

A bare-chested man striking a gong introduced Rank Organisation films right up until the company stopped making them in the 1990s.

Now, the firm - which currently runs bingo clubs and casinos - has brought back the Gongman for the 21st century with a nationwide competition to celebrate its 75th anniversary.

And in a nod to girl power, there's also a Gongwoman.

A 'Gongman' for the 21st century: Chris Rowley from Stoke - winner of a nationwide competition - recreates the Rank Organisation's Gongman pose at London's Grosvenor G Casino yesterday to celebrate the group's 75th birthday

Spot the difference: This shot of one of the original Gongman, boxer Billy Wells, marked the start of hundreds of Rank films. He and others mimed hitting the gong, which was actually made of plaster or papier-mache

Two contestants, including an actress from London, beat nearly 1,000 others to be named the new Rank Gongwoman and Gongman.

Kate Holderness, 28, an actress originally from Preston but now living in London, and semi-professional rugby player Chris Rowley, 25, from Stoke, were the national winners of a search launched in August for someone to revive the role.

They recreated the famous pose seen in the opening credits of hundreds of movies produced and distributed
by the company over more than 50 years.

The famous 'Gongman' preceded the opening credits of every movie produced by The Rank Organisation founded by J. Arthur Rank (pictured below) in 1937.

By 1942, Rank owned more than 600 cinemas and numerous film studios across the country.

In 1945 it set up the Rank Organisation acting school that launched several acting careers such as Christopher Lee, Diana Dors and Dirk Bogarde.

Throughout the 1940s and 50s, it produced some of Britain's most memorable films with world class directors such as Laurence Olivier, Emeric Pressburger and David Lean.

Some of the firm's best known films include To Paris With Love, The Thirty-Nine Steps, The Red Shoes (right) and A Matter Of Life And Death.

The company also branched out into comedy and produced the 'Carry On...' films.

After J. Arthur stepped down as managing director in 1952, Rank continued to diversify its portfolio into other industries such as the manufacture of radios, TVs and photocopiers under the management of Sir John Davis..

In 1996 the company name and some of the remaining assets were taken over by gaming company The Rank Group Plc.

Kicking off celebrations at London’s 
Grosvenor G Casino, Mr Rowley took up the soft-headed stick to 
‘strike’ the gong, a role previously held by wrestler Ken Richmond and
boxer Billy Wells.

Back then, they just mimed striking the gong, which was made of plaster of papier-mache.

However, Mr Rowley won the honour of 
hitting the real thing - albeit a much smaller instrument, held up by a cast iron support.

The original images were shrouded in 
shadow, protecting the modesty of the Gongman, and 
probably to hide the fact that it was actually fake.

Rowley on the other hand was shot in 
full daylight, grinning at the camera in a way that suggests he is 
perfectly comfortable in his tight boxer shorts.

And rather than behind closed studio doors, he stripped off in public, posing on a London high street in front of a shop door. 

Ms Holderness, who has appeared in Emmerdale and Heartbeat, submitted a video of herself taking part in 'extreme gonging' in the 'freestyle' category.

She produced a spoof mini documentary of her apparently 'gonging' the London Eye and Big Ben's clock face at night.

She said: 'I had such a lot of fun making the film and am very excited, and surprised, to have won.

'I really look forward to doing extreme gonging in Vegas.'

Rowley, an insolvency administrator who plays for Stoke Rugby Club, won the 'classic' category after entering through a 'gonging' themed night at his local Grosvenor casino.

He said: 'I was surprised to be in the top 75, let alone win the classic category.

'I genuinely thought someone was winding me up when they told me I'd won as I only entered for a bit of fun.

'I'm really chuffed and look forward to helping launch the Rank Gongman social media brand and launching Grosvenor G Casino Reading.'

Both winners have been given a holiday for two to Las Vegas with $1,000 (£625) spending money.
