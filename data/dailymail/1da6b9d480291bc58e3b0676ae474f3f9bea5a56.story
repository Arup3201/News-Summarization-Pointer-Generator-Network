West Ham have entered the chase for out-of-favour Manchester City defender Micah Richards as the summer transfer window draws to a close.

Sunderland have also enquired about taking the versatile 26-year-old on a season-long loan after Richards grew frustrated at the lack of opportunities at the Etihad. 

Sam Allardyce is desperate for reinforcements as he continues to implement a more attractive playing style at West Ham, which Richard's marauding runs from the flanks would compliment.

Target: West Ham and Sunderland are looking to pick up Micah Richards on loan from Manchester City

Tick tock: Sam Allardyce and Gus Poyet are keen to strengthen before transfer window closes

However, the Hammers would also only be able to finance a loan deal, which might not suit the Premier League champions as they strive to meet Financial Fair Play regulations. 

Richards was once heralded as Gary Neville's successor as England's first-choice right-back but a loss of form and fitness has seen him fall behind Pablo Zabaleta and new arrival Bacary Sagna. 

Black Cats  manager Gus Poyet wants to strengthen his defensive options before Monday's transfer deadline and sees the powerful defender as a viable option.

The Uruguayan had been hoping to seal a loan deal for Porto's Rolando but a move for the Portuguese has stalled. 

Moving on?: Matija Nastasic could also leave the Etihad with interest from Ligue 1 clubs Lille and Marseille

Meanwhile, City have also received inquiries for Matija Nastasic, who has fallen further down the pecking order after the arrival of Eliaquim Mangala from Porto.

French sides Lille and Marseille are both interested in the Serbian defender, who is deemed surplus to requirements by Pellegrini.

The 21-year-old was also missing from the City squad that fell to a surprise loss to Mark Hughes' side at the Etihad.
