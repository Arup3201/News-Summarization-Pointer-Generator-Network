The Syrian regime today vowed to 'cleanse' a rebel-held district in the besieged central city of Homs after nearly four weeks of shelling.

Government troops amassed outside the embattled neighbourhood of Baba Amr, raising fears among activists of an imminent ground invasion that could endanger thousands of residents, as well as two trapped Western journalists, who have been under heavy bombardment.

The latest advance comes after helicopter gunships yesterday opened fire on civilians, activists claimed, as the brutal crackdown on Homs rebels continued for a 25th day.

In response to the latest developments, Britain has withdrawn its diplomatic staff in the country and closed its embassy in Damascus.

Foreign Secretary William Hague made the decision last night after it was decided the 'deterioration in the security situation' had put their safety at risk.

Mr Hague urged those fighting for President Bashar Assad's regime to lay down their arms.

In a written statement to Parliament, 
Mr Hague stressed the decision to withdraw embassy staff 'in no way 
reduces the UK's commitment to active diplomacy to maintain pressure on 
the Assad regime to end the violence'.

In Homs, snow blanketed the city, slowing a ground assault that began yesterday and is nearing Baba Amr, but also worsening the misery of residents short of food, fuel, power, water and telephone links, activists said.

It today emerged that a Spanish 
journalist who had been stuck in Homs has escaped to Lebanon, the second
foreign reporter to do so - following Sunday Times photographer Paul 
Conroy - since a government rocket attack last week killed Marie Colvin and French photographer Remi Ochlik and wounded Edith Bouvier and Conroy.

The fate of the foreign journalists 
has drawn attention to Homs, which has emerged as a key battleground 
between government forces and those seeking to end the regime of the 
authoritarian President Bashar Assad.

The government's increasingly bloody attempts to put down the 11-month uprising have fuelled mounting international criticism.

President Barack Obama summoned Syria's senior envoy in the U.S., Zuheir Jabbour, over the Homs offensive.

The
State Department's top diplomat for the Middle-East, Jeffrey Feltman, 
expressed his 'outrage over the month-long campaign of brutality and 
indiscriminate shelling' in Homs.

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told members of Congress on Tuesday that Assad could be considered a war criminal.

UN
humanitarian chief Valerie Amos said Syria had not yet agreed to allow 
her to into the country. Susan Rice, the US ambassador to the United 
Nations, called that refusal 'shameful'.

Ms
Rice said: 'Rather than meeting the needs of its people, the barbaric 
Syrian government is preparing its final assault on the city of Homs.

'Meanwhile, food shortages are reported to be so severe that people, especially children, will soon start dying of hunger.'

The
UN and the Arab League have appointed former secretary general Kofi 
Annan as their joint envoy to Syria, but Damascus says it needs more 
information on his mission's goals before it will let him in.

The
UN estimates that more than 7,500 people have been killed since the 
anti-Assad struggle started in March 2011, when protesters inspired by 
successful Arab Spring uprisings against dictators in Tunisia and Egypt 
took to the streets in Syria.

As Assad's forces used deadly force to stop the unrest, protests spread and some Syrians took up arms against the regime.

Activists put the total death toll at more than 8,000, most of them civilians.

China
urged world powers to provide humanitarian assistance to Syria, as 
Beijing tries to bolster diplomacy while continuing to oppose any armed 
intervention in the conflict.

Heightening
fears of greater carnage, a Syrian official said the government was 
planning a major offensive against the Homs neighbourhood of Baba Amr.

He
said: 'Baba Amr will be under control complete control in the coming 
hours and we'll cleanse all the armed elements from the area.'

Activists
reported heavy shelling throughout Homs, raising concern that the 
government was preparing a ground invasion to take back the city.

Dead: Marie Colvin was killed in an attack last week

Since
the first week of February, government forces have showered parts of 
Homs with daily barrages of mortars, tank shells and rockets.

The
violence has caused many to flee the city of one million people, 
Syria's third-largest, while those who remain are trapped inside.

Hundreds have been killed in recent weeks, activists say, including residents who foraged for food outside their homes.

It was virtually impossible to reach anyone inside Baba Amr yesterday.

Activists
elsewhere in Homs said their colleagues based in the neighbourhood had 
stopped communicating with the outside because of fears the army would 
trace their satellite signals to target them.

Activist
Mulham al-Jundi, speaking from another part of Homs via Skype, said: 
'Today has been very scary. They are still killing in Baba Amr and the 
water and electricity have been cut to most of the city.'

He and his colleague ran their computer off a small generator to communicate with the outside, he said.

Armed
rebels from a loose-knit group called the Free Syrian Army had been 
fighting with pro-government troops on the outskirts of Homs to try to 
keep them from entering, but he said their inferior arms were not much 
of a deterrent.

He said: 
'The Free Army has been trying to defend the area with almost no 
ammunition for 15 days. What can a Kalashhikov do against a tank and a 
mortar? How can they resist?'

Many civilians had fled the city's rebel-held areas, 'but now those who are in are stuck. There's no way out.'
