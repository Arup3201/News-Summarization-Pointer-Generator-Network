Gun Manufacturers Smith & Wesson have unleashed their newest revolver: a monster .460 calibre handgun which they say is 'great for a back-up gun, or for hunting'.

Named the 'Backpack Cannon', the gun was unveiled in Las Vegas on Monday at the Shooting, Hunting, and Outdoor Trade show, the largest gun show in the U.S., which around 60,000 gun fans attend every year.

The cannon - officially called the Performance Center Model.460 - features a three-inch barrel, high visibility sights and synthetic shock absorber on the rear of the handle, as well as a massive chamber to fit the gigantic .460 calibre rounds, which are some of the biggest and most powerful bullets in the world.

Paul Pluff, who works for Smith & Wesson told Military.com: 'It's a very comfortable gun to shoot. It's great for a back-up gun in the back-country, or even for hunting if 
you’re going after some pigs or hogs or anything like that.'

Experienced hunters warn that pigs can get aggressive when 'up close and personal' and a large bullet is needed to make sure they are dispatched effectively.

Some outdoorsmen also feel the need to handicap themselves and hunt with pistols as technology makes long range rifles increasingly accurate and easy to fire.

Smith & Wesson acknowledges that revolvers have been replaced by high-capacity semi-automatic pistols such as the Glock series when it comes to self defense, often taking the place of 'second-choice' among potential gun owners. 

However large caliber still have a dedicated following, with models such as the .500 Magnum - which fires an even larger bullet than the backpack cannon - being the most popular example.

But while they may be toted by action film heroes, the reality is that large caliber weapons such as the .460 revolver are largely confined to target shooting.

Smith & Wesson says they think that their new revolver will make a nice companion for those that enjoy outdoor activities. 

The company suggests that avid outdoorsmen could carry the gun in their backpack in case their main armament fails.

And the huge caliber of the revolver means it could also be used to fend off bears.

In addition to the plethora of 
attachments that aid targeting and shooting, the gun is also compatible 
with several forms of ammo, able to carry .454 Casull rounds and 
.45 Long Colt ammo, both of which pack a significant punch.

Military.com gave a favorable review to the handgun, saying 'there is still a place for weapons like this especially if you like camping where the critters are big enough to eat you.'

At $1,200 (£730) the gun is much more expensive than your average handgun.

Smith & Wesson was founded in 1852 in Springfield, Massachusetts, by Horace Smith and Daniel B. Wesson.

The company was the first to create the 'lever action pistol' which meant that a shooter would not have to pull the hammer back to fire one shot after the other.

Their handguns quickly became standard issue with law enforcement in the Old West, with famous U.S. lawman Wyatt Earp adopting a Smith & Wesson 'Russian Model' as his primary firearm.

This tradition of law enforcement, including military and police, using Smith & Wesson pistols as their main handgun continues today. 

Smith & Wesson was notably made famous in popular culture by the use of the Magnum Revolver by Clint Eastwood in the Dirty Harry movies, with one of the film's even producing a monologue about the gun itself.
