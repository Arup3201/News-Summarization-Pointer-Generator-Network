Joyriders who stole three golf carts from Clive Palmer's Queensland resort left three cars damaged and knocked over 10 wheelie bins in the process.

The carts were taken  at about 3.30am from Palmer Coolum Resort in south-east Queensland, which was bought by the mining magnate for about $6.5 million in 2011.

Police say one of the thieves embarked on a lengthy journey on the buggy and was arrested about 20km away at Noosa.

The carts also made a pit stop at a skate park after they were taken from what was once a five-star resort which was formerly the Hyatt Regency.

The resort, which used to swarm with happy guests, has been transformed into a  shrine for the billionaire with pictures of the Palmer United Party leader covering the walls and several in-house Palmer TV channels.

When purchasing the hotel in 2011 Clive Palmer promised his newly renovated seaside resort would lure cashed-up Chinese visitors and make for a better economy, The Courier Mail reported.

Nearly three years on, Palmer Coolum Resort sees a minimum return on his self-claimed $2 billion injection into the property, producing nothing but a ghost town, according to A Current Affair.

Since the buggy heist, police say all three carts have since been recovered but only one man is in custody.

He has been charged with three offences including one count of stealing a vehicle.

The 20-year-old man from Yaroomba, also south-east of Queensland, is expected to appear before Maroochydore Magistrates Court today.  

Investigations are continuing.
