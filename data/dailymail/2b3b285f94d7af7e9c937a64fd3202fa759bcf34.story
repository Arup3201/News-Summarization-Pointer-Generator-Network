They seem friendly enough when they’re discussing the creations of the Great British Bake Off contestants.

When it comes to Mary Berry’s cooking, however, Paul Hollywood is prepared to ditch the sweet talk.

Speaking ahead of the final of the BBC1 show tonight, the master baker declared he would beat his co-judge ‘hands down’ if they were to go head-to-head in a baking competition.

Master baker: Paul Hollywood has said he thinks he would beat Mary Berry 'hands down' in a bake off

Earlier this year Miss Berry, 79, was asked who would win in a bake off – but gave a much more diplomatic answer.

‘He’d win the bread, hands down, but I’d win the cakes,’ she told Waitrose Kitchen magazine.

But Hollywood, 48, did not admit to any weakness in either specialism.

In the magazine’s latest issue, he said: ‘I’d beat Mary hands down. Period.’

If you want to stay trim and healthy look to Mary Berry, according to an obesity expert.

The Great British Bake Off judge famously allows herself cake – but only a sliver. And a leading nutrition expert has recommended that this is the best way to stop us craving fatty foods and overindulging later.

Miss Berry, 79, has previously revealed how she is very ‘disciplined’ with her portion sizes and has only a small piece of cake when sampling the bakes for the BBC One contest. The best-selling cookery writer also said she used to be ‘large’ but felt obliged to stay in shape in case the public looked at her and thought ‘that’s what happens when you eat a lot of cake’.

Professor Tom Sanders, an expert in nutrition at Kings College London, said: ‘I like Mary Berry, she bakes cakes with everything that you think is awful; sugar, fats, cream, but she says, “I only eat a bit of it”. That’s the key to it.’

He also called on shops to ban the ‘walk of shame’ whereby they place chocolate bars next to the till to tempt customers queuing. ‘People are having food pushed on to them,’ he said. ‘We have people who are susceptible and can’t say no.

‘This business of being offered bars of chocolate when you buy a newspaper. I think it is part of the problem.’

Since the TV cooks shot to fame when the show started four years ago, both Hollywood and Miss Berry have developed a firm off-screen friendship.

He often stays at her flat in London, and once said she ‘looks after me like I’m one of her family’.

For her part, Miss Berry has said she is full of respect for Hollywood’s professional skills, despite the fact she has decades more experience than him. 

She once said: ‘We respect each other. I would never argue with him over a loaf of something because he knows the science of it – how they’ve achieved it and everything.’

Just who would be victorious in a baking battle is unclear. 

After joining the family baking business at 18, Hollywood went on to work as head baker for exclusive hotels including Cliveden House and The Dorchester. 

And he famously created an Almond and Roquefort sourdough bread that was sold for £15 a loaf at Harrods. 

Meanwhile Miss Berry trained at The Cordon Bleu cookery school in Paris before embarking on a career as a food writer in the 1960s. 

Today she has more than 70 books to her name, compared to Hollywood’s five, which has helped her make an estimated fortune of £5million.
