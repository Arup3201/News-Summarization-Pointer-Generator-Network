Arrested: Mark Williams, 33 was hauled from his own wedding

A western Pennsylvania groom spent his wedding night in jail after he allegedly got handsy with a pregnant waitress at the reception, tried to force the underage woman to have shots or liquor with him and then resisted arrest after an altercation with her boyfriend.

Groom Mark Williams, 33, is accused of touching the waitress several times during his wedding aboard a Gateway Clipper cruise down Pittsburgh's Monongahela River on Sunday, a criminal complaint says.

The 19-year-old woman, who is pregnant, said Williams tried to pour liquor down her throat and force her to have shots with him, WTAE reported.

'The groom was so drunk,' the waitress, who asked to not be identified, told the station. 'He came over and started rubbing my head and put his hand on my body, 
just touchy-feely.'

The woman got uncomfortable and called her boyfriend, 20-year-old Tyler Smith, to come pick her up at the end of the cruise.

When Smith arrived about 1am on Monday, he confronted Williams and they started to trade punches — all while the shocked bride Edyta Williams watched, KDKA reported.

That's when Williams' brother David and groomsman Brian Taylor jumped into the altercation.

David
 Williams, a 35-year-old Pennsylvania State trooper, ignored police 
orders to back down and eventually assaulted two Pittsburgh police 
officers who were called to the scene, authorities said.

Taylor, 31, who is a member of the Sto-Rox School Board, punched through a car's window.

'I'm
 not clear if he was trying to break it up, or if he was trying to 
participate in the fight, but whatever happened, his hand went through a
 window of a parked car, which caused blood to go all over the place,' 
Pittsburgh PD spokeswoman Sonya Toler told WTAE.

'I do know there was a lot of blood at the scene. It was kind of confusing and loud.'

Bizarrely,
 a bleeding Taylor began to yell that he was HIV positive while he 
resisted arrest, KDKA reported. He later denied ever saying that, 
according tot he station.

Police say that groomsman Brian Taylor, 31, punched through car window during the altercation and started to yell he was HIV positive while resisting arrest. He was covered in his own blood

The groom, his brother and Taylor were all hauled to Allegheny County Jail.

Williams faces charges including riot, harassment and resisting arrest. He declined comment to reporters outside court Monday.

His
 brother David faces charges of aggravated assault, resisting arrest and
 obstructing law enforcement, according to KDKA. The Pennsylvania State 
Police is conducting an internal investigation of his conduct, according
 to the station.

Taylor also faces charges.

The bride, meanwhile, just looked on in horror as this all unfolded, said the 19-year-old waitress.

'She was very understanding — she didn't at all argue with anybody,' the woman told WTAE. 'She was probably shocked and in tears that this happened on her day.'
