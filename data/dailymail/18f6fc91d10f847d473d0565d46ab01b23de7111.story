An alleged neo-Nazi accused of planning to carry out a cyanide attack against British ethnic minorities has appeared in court today.

Mark Colborne is alleged to have been preparing to carry out race hate terror attack against 'non-Aryans' in the UK.

Police raided the 36-year-old college studentâ€™s Southampton home which he shared with his mother last month.

He was bailed but subsequently charged with terrorism offences.

Today Colborne appeared at Westminster Magistrates today charged with engaging in conduct in the preparation of terrorism acts contrary to section 5(1) of the Terrorism Act 2006.

He was remanded in custody and will appear at the Old Bailey on July 18.

District Judge John Zani said: 'I am transferring this case to the Central Criminal Court where you will appear on July 18 where I am sure the judge will want to progress your case.

'I have refused your application for bail. These are very serious allegations, though I must stress they are only allegations and you have not been convicted of anything.

'You are of previous good character which I have taken into account. But in my view there are substantial grounds that persuade me not to release you on bail as you may well re-offend and not attend court.

'You face a lengthy prison sentence if you are convicted of this offence, and for these reasons I am not granting you bail.'

Wearing a navy blue jumper and black trousers, he wiped a tear away as he sat with his arms crossed in the glass-fronted dock at the London court.

Trial: The judge at Westminster Magistrate's Court warned Colborne, who had a West Country accent when he appeared in the dock, that he faces a lengthy prison sentence if  he's convicted

Flanked by two plain-clothed officers and a uniformed dock officer, Colborne spoke with a West Country accent only to confirm his name, age and address.

He repeatedly glanced over to his mother, who works in an animal sanctuary and sat tearfully in the public gallery during the hearing.

No indication of plea was given.

Hampshire police said his arrest is not part of a wider investigation and there is no threat to the local community.
