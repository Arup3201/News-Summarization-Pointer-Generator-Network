Petra Kvitova is currently sixth on the WTA Road to Singapore leaderboard and reached the third round of this year's US Open. Here, she talks to Sportsmail's Mike Dickson about making sushi and playing tennis with Richard Branson.

Who is your Sporting hero?

Martina Navratilova.

What would you be if you weren’t a sportswoman?

Something connected with psychology, not necessarily sports psychology, I am interested in that whole area.

Hero: Petra Kvitova said her hero was Martina Navratilova, who gave her excellent advice before Wimbledon

Which sportsman would you like to be?

If I’m allowed to choose a man it would be Jaromir Jagr, the Czech ice hockey legend who plays for New Jersey Devils.

Career highlight?

Winning Wimbledon for the second time. It was a bit more special showing myself that I could do it again after the first one.

... And the worst moment?

Losing in the first round of the Australian Open this year. I was convinced I was going to do well there and had really high hopes so it was extra disappointing.

If your house was burning down, what one possession would you save?

To be honest nothing special, it would be my passport or my phone.

Highlight: Kvitova sad her career highlight was winning Wimbledon for a second time

What’s the best advice you’ve ever been given?

Navratilova told me before my first Wimbledon final: ‘Treat it like any other match and don’t be satisfied with just reaching the final’.

Favourite karaoke song?

I’ve never sang karaoke and I doubt I ever will, it’s not my style.

Three most-listened to songs on your i-pod?

Am I Wrong by Nico and Vinz, Rip Tight by Vince Joy and Budapest by Ezra.

Last film you saw?

The Notebook. I like romantic movies when I’m in the mood but my favourites are comedies.

Last book you read?

Li Na, My Life. She is a friend and some-one I admire with a fascinating story.

US Open: Kvitova went out of the 2014 US Open in the third round after losing to Aleksandra Krunic

Which three people would you invite to dinner?

My mother, father and my best friend from home Veronica, a medical student.

Favourite pre-match meal?

Plain rice or pasta with parmesan cheese on top.

Can you cook? Best dish?

I hardly ever cook. It’s not something I enjoy. I like sushi – I can’t make it but did try once and it wasn’t very good.

Holiday: Kvitova revealed she went on holiday to the Maldives where she played tennis with Richard Branson

Favourite holiday destination?

Anywhere with a beach. I went to the Maldives a couple of years ago and last winter went to Necker Island to play tennis with Richard Branson.

In a film of your life, who would YOU like to play you?

Cameron Diaz.

What’s the most expensive thing you’ve ever bought?

The earrings I bought the day after winning Wimbledon this year to wear at the champions’ dinner, the first time I’ve bought a present for myself.

Tell us a secret...

My room is incredibly untidy when I stay in hotels. When I’m in a house it’s a bit better but still not perfect.
