This is the dramatic moment the former home of a celebrated Victorian poet suddenly collapsed into a pile of rubble after a workman removed a single brick.

Worried locals in Ashton-under-Lyne, Manchester, had called the police to report falling debris from the modest two-storey terraced property in the town centre.

Officers quickly decided to cordon off the building, which stood next to a popular nightclub, and closed a section of the road.

Crash: The former home of Victorian poet Francis Thompson collapses moments after an engineer removed a single brick

With the property appearing to bow 
outwards by around a foot, a structural engineer was sent up on a cherry
 picker to take a closer look.

But after he removed a single brick from a section of the front wall near the roof, the building suddenly collapsed into a pile of dust.

One eye witness said: 'He was up there trying to make it safe and he obviously took out the wrong brick. The whole lot came down with a loud rumble,' one said.

It is believed no-one was hurt during the drama.

A blue plaque mounted on the front of the building marks the fact it was once home to poet Francis Thompson who lived there between 1864 and 1885.

The son of a doctor and Roman Catholic convert, Francis Thompson was born on December 16, 1859 in Preston, Lancashire. After studying medicine he moved to London as a young man to pursue his dream of becoming a writer.

But he would soon fall upon hard times being forced to sell matches and newspapers for a living. Then, after becoming addicted to opium which he first took as a medicine for ill health, he became a tramp sleeping rough by the River Thames.

He was saved by a young couple who, impressed with his work, found him a home and published his first book of poems in 1893.

But Thompson would continue to struggle with his opium addiction for most of his life. He moved around the country living in extreme poverty as an invalid in Wales and Storrington.

At one point he even attempted suicide, later claiming he was only saved by a vision of the poet Thomas Chatterton, who had committed suicide almost a century earlier.

He was befriended by a prostitute who took him in and gave him money. Although he never revealed her identity he would describe her in his poems as his saviour.

Thompson's most famous work is the haunting poem The Hound of Heaven which describes the pursuit of the human soul by God.

It includes the lines: 'My mangled youth lies dead beneath the heap. My days have crackled and gone up in smoke. Have puffed and burst as sun-starts on a stream.'

Other notable works include the famous cricket poem At Lord's and a treatise On Health and Holiness, which was published two years before his death in 1905.

Among his biggest fans was a young J.R.R. Tolkien, who described him as an important influence on his own writing

Thompson died from tuberculosis in 1907 at the age of 48. He was buried in St. Mary's Roman Catholic Cemetery in London.
