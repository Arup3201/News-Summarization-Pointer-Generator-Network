Bitter: Michelle has pursued he former husband for years over his refusal to disclose his full worth and reach a settlement

A ‘bankrupt’ tycoon at the centre of the country’s most acrimonious divorce case stood to make £2.8 billion from Facebook shares, the High Court heard today.

Scot Young, 51, also received £80m in cash payments between 2004 and 2009 ‘for which no entries were found in the bank statements provided’, the court was told.

The businessman is accused by his estranged wife Michelle, 49, of hiding the proceeds of his empire in a bid to deny her a huge cash settlement.

Mr Young was said to be worth £400m in 2006 but now claims to be penniless and heavily indebted.

But his wife has demanded £300m, maintaining her husband is worth ‘a few billion at least’.

She has claimed to be living in a Pimlico bedsit and struggling to make ends meet.

Today Rex Howling QC, for Mrs Young, referred to a forensic analysis of Mr Young’s bank accounts.

The search had revealed ‘a phenomenal amount of money’ passing through them, Mr Howling said.

‘There was £134m of cash movement through your various accounts between January 2004 and October 2009.

‘A total of £80m of payments were made to Mr Young, for which no entries were found in the bank statements provided.’

The barrister also referred to a hand-written note of Mr Young, which was seized in 2012.

The scrap of paper mentioned the Facebook flotation and a share deal involving Silicon Valley giant Sean Parker, the social network’s first president.

‘Will make $4.5 billion’, it concluded.

Mr Young denies the claims but insisted: ‘This is just a random piece of paper with my scribbling.‘Can I state for the record that I have never owned shares in Facebook in any shape or form’, he said.

Mr Howling asked why Mr Young had paid out a £200,000 deposit on two villa in February 2006, during the period of his supposed ‘financial demise’.

‘If you knew that you were already in difficulty, why were you investing £200,000 in that sort of project?’, Mr Howling asked.

‘Because I was getting it at a very good discount to the market value’, Mr Young responded.

The businessman was asked why he had received emails and service charge bills for London properties he claimed not to own to which he responded: 'I think its a little bit unfair that I’m being asked to prove a negative.'

Mr Young was also quizzed on a labyrinthine network of companies which it is alleged were used to hide his vast fortune.

‘These are all public companies!’, he exclaimed.

‘That doesn’t prevent you owning small or large shareholdings in those companies’, Mr Howling said.

But Mr Young contested this claiming that such ownership would have been disclosed to the court.

Yesterday the court heard from lawyer Stephen Jones, of Jirehouse Capital.

Mr Jones frequently avoided questions by citing legal privilege, but denied helping Mr Young create a ‘sham’ bankruptcy.

Mr Justice Moor had earlier rejected a bid to hear his evidence in private.

Later, the court heard from Paul Osborne, senior partner at city law firm Fox Williams, who had regularly dealt with Mr Young.

Mr
Howling said Fox Williams held around 200 ledgers, and 'hundreds if not
thousands of files' related to Mr Young's business activities.

He asked Mr Osborne whether his firm had retained any documentation which had not been disclosed but they claimed they had not.

The court however did hear Mr Young concede that around 30 to 40 'residual' and unimportant files remained.

'They had no interest in those matters', he said.

The court also heard a fresh explanation for 'Project Marriage Walk' which was a plan to purchase a house in Bletchley Park, rather than a plot to hide Mr Young's wealth during the breakdown of his marriage, the court heard.

The court also heard from Gwilym Davies, dubbed Mr Young's 'first lieutenant'.

He called his former boss 'quite secretive' and admitted that Mr Young would 'keep the bigger things to himself'.

Mrs Young audibly scoffed as Mr Davies said his salary from Mr Young had been £120,000 per annum.

Mr Young was jailed for three months earlier this year after he refused to reveal information about his finances.

He was found in contempt of court in what Mr Justice Moor said was ‘flagrant and deliberate’ disobedience.

The Youngs met in 1986 and have two daughters together but separated in 2006.

Their bitter divorce proceedings have lasted for several years and the hearing continues.
