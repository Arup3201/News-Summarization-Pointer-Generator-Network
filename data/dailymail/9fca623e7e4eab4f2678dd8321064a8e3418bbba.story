A woman suffering such severe arthritis that her elbows fused at 90 degrees has married after having life-changing surgery.

Alice Swallow, 24, has suffered from rheumatoid arthritis since the age of ten.

Her condition was so severe that she was unable to bend her arms until she had surgery last year.

Doctors performed two elbow replacement operations - giving her the ability to fold her arms again.

Brave: Alice Swallow has suffered from crippling rheumatoid arthritis for 14 years. On Saturday she married fiance Ryan

Close: Until she had surgery last year, Alice couldn't even hold Ryan's hand, as her elbows were fused at 90 degrees

Until then, the agonising condition meant she had never held her fiance Ryan's hand.

And on Saturday, the couple tied the knot surrounded by their family and friends near Kelvedon, Essex.

Alice, of Ipswich, Suffolk, met Ryan, 26, in 2009. Before she underwent surgery, she relied heavily on Ryan to help her with everyday tasks such as pouring drinks, getting dressed and washing her hair.  

Alice had her elbow replacement surgery 
at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital in London. The operation is 
relatively rare and only carried out between 500 and 1,000 times a year 
in the UK.

Operation: Alice is thought to be one of the youngest people in Britain to undergo the life-changing elbow surgery

Life changing: Before the surgery, Alice relied heavily on Ryan to help her with everyday tasks such as pouring drinks, getting dressed and washing her hair

Alice is one of the youngest people in Britain to have undergone the tough procedure.

She believes that had she not had the life-changing surgery, she would never have married.

She said: 'I lost a lot of self-confidence and I wouldn't even try a wedding dress on until I had recovered.

'The movement I have regained in my arms [since having surgery] is just amazing.

'I would never have walked down the aisle if I couldn't do the things I can now.'

Celebrating: Alice believes she would never have married had she not undergone the radical surgery

Hopeful: 'We have so much to look forward to and there is now nothing really holding us back,' said Alice

Speaking about her wedding, she added: 'I was so excited to walk up the aisle and see Ryan in his suit. It went perfectly.

'We couldn't have had a better day if we tried, it was just amazing.

'Ryan's been my absolute rock since the day we got together and I am really proud to call him my husband.

'We have so much to look forward to and there is now nothing really holding us back.'

Ryan added: 'I am so proud of Alice - she's had to put up with so much. But she looked beautiful and it brought a tear to my eye.'
