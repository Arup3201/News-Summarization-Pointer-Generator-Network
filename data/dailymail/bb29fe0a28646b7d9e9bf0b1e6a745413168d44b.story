He's already ruled out standing for a third term as Mayor of London, sparking speculation he had his sights set on becoming Prime Minister.

But Boris Johnson may have hinted that his next political move is even more ambitious than the British premiership - a tilt at becoming President of the United States.

During an interview with late night U.S. TV host David Letterman, American-born Boris revealed he qualifies for a pitch at the White House under the constitution.

Larger than life: London Mayor Boris Johnson gesticulates wildly as he appears on The Late Show with David Letterman, broadcast live from New York last night

Scruffy: The jovial politician was in New York to promote his latest book, Johnson¿s Life of London, but took time to talk about his achievements and ambitions as London's top official

He said: ‘As you’ve already pointed out I could be president of the United States, technically speaking.’

Discussing his own American roots, he
said: ‘I was born in New York. A fact I try to conceal from the 
electorate of London. It makes me jointly an American citizen.

'This will be broadcast in London and
I wish to make it absolutely clear that my parents were British. I 
wanted to be close to my mother and that was where she was.

He said he was five when he moved 
back to Britain. ‘I didn’t remember so much about New York because we 
moved to Washington and Connecticut. I remember America. It is a most 
wonderful country.’

The Mayor also used the book tour to promoted the city’s transportation in an appearance with late night show.

But at times, eccentric Boris hit an 
awkward note as he boasted about London’s hop on, hop-off buses 
returning to the capital ‘so you can get drunk and fall off backwards.’

‘That was banned in the name of safety,’ he said, referring to ‘the wonderful new bus we’ve restored to the streets of London.’

Cracking jokes, he appeared to enjoy baiting the Americans, claiming at one point that he was unlikely to copy a New York ban on giant-sized fizzy drinks because ‘as a city we are not quite as fat, not yet. I have to be honest, we’re not there yet.’

'How long have you been cutting your own hair?' Veteran talk show host Letterman earned the night's biggest laugh with his wry observation of the London mayor's trademark coiffure

'London has it all': Mayor Boris made an impassioned vindication of the UK capital as the world's greatest city even, controversially, claiming the U.S. as 'the proudest creation of London'

He also elicited a big groan from the 
studio audience when he said: ‘I regard America as the proudest creation
of London. It was the ideals of liberty and democracy and habeas corpus
and freedom of speech from 18th century London that were transmitted, 
would you not say?’

But Letterman got the biggest laugh of the night when he asked the mayor: ‘How long have you been cutting your own hair?’ 

‘I think that was a low blow,’ retorted Johnson. 

‘I was beginning to think I'd got 
through this more or less unscathed. You even mentioned the book more 
than a few times,’ he added, referring to Johnson’s Life of London, his 
latest tome he was in New York promoting.

Asked if he would run as mayor a third
time, he said: ‘This will be my second term. I regret I said I wouldn’t
run any more. I said that’s it.’

Pressed on whether he would ever be prime minister, he added: ‘I have about as much chance as being reincarnated as an olive.’

American roots: The London mayor was in fact born in New York

‘Do you think the hair is holding you back?’ joked Letterman.

‘Until you mentioned it tonight, I’d never regarded it as doing that,’ he replied.

Dressed in a black suit with 
purple tie, the mayor marched onto the set to the tune of Clash’s 
‘London Calling’ on last night and quickly made himself at home, making reference to Samuel Johnson’s famous quote ‘When a man is tired of London, he is tired of life.’

‘For
any man or woman who is at all intellectual London has it all. My 
purpose is to celebrate London, to encourage people to come to the city 
and to proclaim the genius of London,’ he explained.

‘The
population is about 7.8million. It’s growing. It’s unlike any other 
major city in that its growing. In order to cope you have to put in more
homes, an ever better transportation system.’

Hailing
the success of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee, he said to Letterman: ‘You 
left out the rain. The rain was a critical ingredient. I heard someone 
said it was one of the greatest aquatic triumphs of the British people 
since Trafalgar. It was like a kind of version of Dunkirk except with a 
much jollier outcome.’

Talk of the Jubilee was an opportunity for another Boris joke to drop like a lead balloon.

‘Well,
I try to get everything sponsored. In this country there’s a very 
famous and distinguished banker, Bob Diamond, and I said if he sponsored
it would be called the Diamond jubilee.

‘I’m making that up by the way. He’s a very generous guy Bob Diamond.’

When the audience sounded confused, Letterman said: 'I have to explain a lot of my jokes, too.’

‘He runs Barclays, which I think has a presence here,’ added Johnson, undeterred.

'Entirely communist scheme': Mr Johnson also took the opportunity to praise his own 'Boris bikes', which now number 6,000 at stations across the centre of London

On the Olympics, he said: ‘Its all going to be fantastic. You’re most welcome to come.’

‘As I hope people will discover if they come this summer, there has been massive investment in the tube network, which is good because there is a very old system,  a massive new fast across town train system coming in, a wonderful new bus we’ve restored to the streets of London the hop on hop off, so you can get drunk and fall over backwards. That was banned in the name of safety and we’ve now restored that.'

Of London’s bicycle transport, he said: ‘It’s an entirely  communist scheme put in by a conservative mayor and it works beautifully. We have more than 6,000 bikes on the streets.’

Just in case anyone was taking him too seriously, Johnson said he was a big fan of New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg.

‘One time he was standing for election and I came here and he was in quite a tough fight and I asked him if it would be at all useful for me to endorse him.

‘He thought about it for a while and he said he’d much prefer it if I’d endorsed his opponent.’
