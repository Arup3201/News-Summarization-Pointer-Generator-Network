It was claimed multi-millionaire entrepreneur Paul Bloomfield did not pay tax for 24 years

Tax officials failed to prosecute a multi-millionaire property investor who did not pay any tax for 24 years, it was claimed last night.

Entrepreneur Paul Bloomfield enjoyed a lavish lifestyle including luxury homes, a helicopter and a private jet but did not submit any returns or pay a penny in tax for more than two decades, according to the BBC.

His case was said to be the most extreme to have emerged in Britain since the HSBC scandal was revealed and raised further questions about HM Revenue & Customs’ apparent failure to prosecute tax dodgers.

Mr Bloomfield, nicknamed Boom Boom Bloomfield for his series of property deals in the Eighties, was reportedly named in the list of Britons with offshore accounts with HSBC in Switzerland.

BBC’s Panorama reported he met HMRC investigators in 2011 – five years after his personal wealth was estimated at £60million – but told them he did not own any property of have any income of his own. Panorama said it had seen notes of the meeting, which said: ‘Bloomfield confirmed that his living expenses are paid from wherever there is money.

‘In his words there is a box somewhere which contains money and he arranges for the bills to be paid.’

Mr Bloomfield, who helped to arrange finance for the new Wembley stadium in 2003, claimed an offshore company paid his rent and another firm paid for his use of a Boeing 757, a boat and a helicopter.

During his 2011 meeting with HMRC officials he denied having an offshore bank account, but the HSBC files – given to HMRC by France a year earlier in 2010 – reportedly revealed he had an offshore account with HSBC in 1993.

Tax officials were said to have not believed Mr Bloomfield’s denials about not having any income and concluded he was liable for tax for the past 20 years, but he was not prosecuted.

Panorama reported he was now living in Spain but said he had not responded to its requests for comment.

An HMRC spokesman said: ‘We don’t talk about identifiable taxpayers. We take a wide range of factors into account when deciding the right course of action.’

There has only been one conviction against the thousands of British taxpayers named in the HSBC offshore account files, although HMRC has said it recouped £135million in unpaid tax and fines through civil settlements.

One former business associate, Mohammad Ghadami, told Panorama: ‘It wasn’t true he had no income, he had a few cars, a few drivers, security, a very expensive wife, an aeroplane.

‘One thing he had, it was money. And he had so much organisation – accountants and lawyers – to work for him and to hide the money.’

Mr Ghadami won £110million in damages after a legal dispute with Mr Bloomfield. Mr Bloomfield’s previous addresses have been in Kensington and Knightsbridge, West London and he is now thought to be living in Spain.

Former tax inspector Richard Brooks, who now write on tax matters, added: ‘If you haven’t paid any tax and you’re given a chance by the Revenue to come clean, especially when the amount is on this scale, and you don’t, then you can expect to be prosecuted. That is what you would expect.’

The BBC last night said that if HMRC had checked the data about HSBC’s Swiss accounts when it was first handed over, officials would have discovered one belonging to Mr Bloomfield and been able to take action years ago.

■Questions to BBC Trust chairman Rona Fairhead about her role as a member of HSBC bank’s audit committee went unanswered last night. The Corporation was asked by the Guardian newspaper how much she knew about activities at the company’s Swiss private banking arm – where up to 100,000 wealthy clients from across the world had secret accounts.
