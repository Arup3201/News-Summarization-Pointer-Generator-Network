A terminally ill woman is fighting to end her life so that she can donate her organs so others can live.

Sherri Muzher, 43, from Detroit, Michigan, was just 27 when she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in the summer after her first year at law school.

The incurable condition, which causes the immune system to attack the body's central nervous system, has seen her body deteriorate drastically, leaving her unable to walk and barely talk.

She she says now wants to regain control of her life - by choosing when she will die.

Life after death: Sherri Muzher, who was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis 16 years ago, wants to end her life so that she can donate her organs to those who need them

'I would rather I help give life to others while my organs are still viable,' she told WDIV. 'It is my reality. I'm getting weaker. Weaker muscles on my talking, everything. This ultimately brings reality home.'

Of her condition, she added: 'It is a lot of loss - loss with advanced MS. It's a grieving process, because you are losing your independence gradually.'

Medical ethicists said while Muzher's case is compelling, it is troubled by the fact she lives in Michigan, which is still haunted by the case of Dr Jack Kervorkian.

The doctor, who was branded 'Doctor Death', was a euthanasia activist who claimed to have assisted in as many as 130 deaths.

In 1999, he was arrested and tried for his role in a case of voluntary euthanasia and served eight years of a 10-to-25-year sentence.

'It think that it's possible [a law could change in Michigan],
but it's something that in Michigan in particular is going to be very 
controversial given our history with Dr. Kevorkian,' Lance Gable, a law professor at Wayne State University, told MyFoxDetroit.

'Her motivations seem to be very heartfelt. She wants to both control her own destiny and also to help other people, and I think that's a very compelling story to tell.'

Physician-assisted suicide is only legal in Oregon, Washington, Vermont and Montana.

Medical ethicist Dr. Michael Stellini told WDIV that the case would be presented with problems.

Problematic: Experts said it is unlikely assisted dying laws will change in Michigan due to the history of 'Dr Death' Kervorkian (pictured), who was jailed after helping in a patient's suicide

'If we wait too long, she couldn't donate,' he said. If we do it too early, she's not terminal, and that raises a whole other set of ethical issues.'

He added that a law could also bring rise to more ethical questions in the future.

'One of the new dimensions that we'd have to consider is, would folks feel more coerced to go this route because there would be benefit for someone else?' Stellini said.

But while Muzher said it is too late for her lungs, she hopes that being allowed to die when she chooses would provide her kidneys, liver, heart and other organs for those in need.

'I'd rather still be useful and help, rather than waste away and not be able to help,' she said. 'What will give me joy is to know I left a legacy of giving life to others.'
