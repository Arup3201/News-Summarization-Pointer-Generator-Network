He works, he says, 'incredibly hard' combining running marshmallow business Boomf with the demands of being a royal in-law.

But it seems James Middleton, 27, still has some time to spare as he used some of it to give a master class on tying a bow tie on a British website.

In the video, entitled James Middleton: Handling A Bow Tie, the Duchess of Cambridge's younger brother is seen fiddling with his tie in front of a mirror while explaining that the accessory needs to be treated 'like a shoelace'.

Advice: James Middleton has appeared on a British website to share his tips on tying a bow tie

'I've always been told, the trick to tying a bow tie is to tie it like a shoelace,' he explains. 'You've got to keep each side as flat as possible.'

Offering his advice in a style that will be recognisable to anyone who read  Pippa Middleton's much-mocked party book, Celebrate, he continues: 'It does look a little bit messy to start with but once you've got both sides through like a shoelace, you then spend a little bit of time fiddling around with it.

'Then you pull it tight, loosen it a little bit and then you've got something that looks like a bow tie.'

The video appeared alongside an interview with iPad-only under-30's entrepreneur lifestyle magazine, The Young Director (TYD).

In it, Mr Middleton complained that being related to a royal 'does get frustrating' because his own work and businesses are so often overshadowed.

He has nevertheless had several of those, with his current company, Boomf, selling a box of nine high-end marshmallows for £15 a pop. 

Mr Middleton says he is very much involved at the business, which he co-founded after his first venture The Cake Kit Company, adding: 'I have only ever employed myself.'

Expanding on the theme of being overshadowed by his sister, he continued: 'I work incredibly hard— just like every other person in business and work.

'And aside from the fact of — yes, I am the brother of someone very important—I am, at the end of the day, just James.'

This is not the first time that one of Mr Middleton's forays into the media spotlight has proved controversial. 

In November, during an appearance on Good Morning America to promote his marshmallow business, the 27-year-old offered titbits of royal gossip along with his business pitch.

During that interview, he revealed that he had bought the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's pet spaniel Lupo as 'a little treat' following the 2011 Royal Wedding.

He also spoke about being uncle to the future king and of the hysteria surrounding the birth of Prince George last July.

'The most wonderful thing was that everyone was celebrating with us,' he said. 'Me, becoming an uncle and my parents becoming grandparents. It was exciting.

'I still see Prince George as my nephew and I just want to be the best uncle possible. Like any uncle wants to be, I want to be the cool uncle.'
