Canadian pop sensation Justin Bieber may have the largest number of Twitter followers in the world - but more than half of them are fake, it emerged today.

The teenage singer has 37.3million followers on the popular social network, and overtook previous record-holder Lady Gaga earlier this year.

However Justin, 19, does not only hold the crown for most followers, but also the most bogus ones.

Emperor's new tweets: More than half of Justin Bieber's followers are fake accounts and not real 'Beliebers', knocking off his King of Twitter crown

Only 17.8million of Justin Bieber’s Twitter followers are real accounts, a mere 47 per cent of his total number of followers, according to social media analytics experts Socialbakers.

A fake account is one which has one or no followers and follow less than 50 others. It can also be one which is used to send spam tweets or one which has never tweeted at all.

With less than half of his Twitter fans ‘real', Justin’s loses his King of Twitter title to previous top-dog Lady Gaga, whose authentic followers reach 19million.

This is the latest blow to the young star, who has been displaying increasingly erratic behaviour, since splitting up with his actress girlfriend Selena Gomez in December 2012.

Bieber faced allegations of marijuana abuse after being snapped holding a suspicious cigarette at a party in February.

Irrational behaviour: Justin Bieber gets into a fight with a paparazzi outside his hotel in London after leaving his young fans waiting for two hours at a concert

During his visit to London earlier this year, he engaged in public spats with paparazzi and displayed shocking diva-like manners as he kept young fans waiting for over two hours before taking to the stage at the O2 Arena in the capital.

After he was jetted out of the country, he swore to never return.

Bieber's irrational actions have continued during the Europe-leg of his tour. He has been photographed in gas masks and covering his face with a blanket to avoid the cameras - in stark contrast to his behaviour in Frankfurt, Germany when he was seen walking in freezing weather without a shirt on.

His most recent controversy involves a baby capuchin monkey called Mally, a 19th birthday present form a music producer friend, who was confiscated by customs in Munich.

Despite an outrage from animal experts who argue 14-week-old Mally was taken from his mother more than a year too soon, Bieber is reportedly doing everything he can to get his very own Bubbles back.
