Ally McCoist's men celebrate 1-0 victory in Canada

Rangers rounded off their North American tour in the early hours of Thursday morning with their third win out of four matches in California and Canada.

While their penultimate match, an uninspiring 2-1 win over Victoria Highlanders on Vancouver Island, had Ally McCoist lamenting his young second string’s display, out here in the Canadian capital another kid served yet more notice that he is indeed the real deal.

Midfielder Lewis Macleod was simply sensational against Ottawa Fury, showing he is back to his best and fully over the virus that attacked his internal organs and ruled him out for the second half of last season. 

On target: Nicky Law scored the winning goal for Rangers on 37 minutes

Rangers (3-5-2): Bell (Simonsen 46); Mohsni, McCulloch, McGregor; Wallace, Macleod, Black (Hutton 73), Law, Gallagher (Smith 78); Miller, Boyd (Shiels 78).

Subs not used: Kelly, Crawford, Murdoch, Templeton, Clark, McKay.

Goals: Law (37).Attendance: 8643.

Macleod spoke eloquently earlier this week about fearing his career was over but on this form he could go right to the very top of the game.

The highlight of his excellent performance came midway through the first half when he set up Nicky Law’s only goal of the game with a neat pirouette move that could have come straight out of the Zinedine Zidane playbook.

Overall, this was far more like it from McCoist’s men, after some stuttering performances out here against Ventura County Fusion, Sacramento Republic and Victoria Highlanders.

Perhaps it helped that not only were Fury the best calibre of opposition Rangers have faced, this match was played out in a venue ideally suited for football, the impressive TD Place stadium.

It compared favourably with the spectacular fairground setting Rangers played in against Sacramento, and the low-key University campus fields that hosted Ventura County Fusion and Victoria Highlanders. And with a better standard of opposition, there was a lot more bite to this encounter.

Fury, a team in the second tier of US soccer pyramid, below MLS, were captained by the former Dundee United midfielder Richie Ryan. On their bench was Nicki Paterson, a 29-year-old Scot, who played with Hamilton before quitting his homeland in 2005 to go to the University of Nevada in Las Vegas.

With Richard Foster and Seb Faure out injured, the lack of a fit right-back saw McCoist go to a three at the back. Captain Lee McCulloch was placed between Bilel Mohsni and Darren McGregor. The central midfield three were Ian Black, Macleod and Law, with Lee Wallace and Calum Gallagher on either flank. Kris Boyd and Kenny Miller were the front pairing.

The first noteworthy action of the first half action came when Macleod’s corner was headed against the bar by McCulloch. Then Fury’s Tony Donatelli crunched into Black with unnecessary force, earning a yellow card and prompting anger amongst the Rangers players.

Miller was chasing his first goal of the tour and should have scored but he failed to make a proper connection on Macleod’s fine ball across goal. Macleod was at the centre of every Rangers move of note and it was no surprise it was his sublime skill that set up Law to crack home superbly from 15 yards.

Fury had a great chance of their own to level when Vini Dantas clearly fouled Mohsni before running through on substitute keeper Steve Simonsen, only to crack his shot past the far post. An apoplectic Mohsni had to be stopped by his own teammates from complaining to referee Mathieu Bourdeau about the lack of a whistle.

In the second half, Law nearly grabbed a second after good work by Boyd but the former Motherwell midfielder fired wide.

Then Rangers should have had a penalty when Omar Jarun handled a header by McCulloch. And there was another dodgy decision when an onside Miller was flagged offside after heading into the net a Black’s shot that spun up off Fury defender Jarun. That meant Miller drew a blank in four match out here, while Boyd also failed to notch and he was replaced by Dean Shiels for the final 11 minutes.

But Rangers boss McCoist will have been relatively pleased with what he saw here against Fury. Rangers jet home to Scotland on Friday, before the build-up to the new Scottish Championship season continues with a friendly against Derby County at Pride Park on August 2.

The new competitive campaign kicks off against Hibs in the Petrofac Challenge Cup three days later at Ibrox.
