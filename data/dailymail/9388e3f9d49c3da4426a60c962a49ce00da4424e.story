A day after being berated in court by her husband, Shelly Sterling returned to the witness stand Thursday in a trial to determine whether she has the right to sell Donald Sterling's Los Angeles Clippers for $2 billion.

Mrs Sterling said her husband encouraged her to sell the team for the best price after the NBA banned him from the league for life for making racist remarks.

She moved quickly to get bids and kept her husband informed daily, she said in Los Angeles County Superior Court.

Testify: Donald Sterling's wife Shelly Sterling arrives at a Los Angeles court on Tuesday to discuss the sale of the Clippers

When she reported that former Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer had offered $2 billion, Donald Sterling became excited and said she had done a good job, but within days his mood changed, she said.

He became enraged in a conversation, cursed her, said he would never sell the team and would sue the league, she testified.

Mrs Sterling also defended the deal she unilaterally made with Ballmer - which would be a record price for an NBA team - and said she believed the sale would prevent disaster for the Clippers.

Mrs Sterling said she feared players and sponsors would start a boycott if her husband held on to the team.

Donald Sterling contends that his wife had no right under a family trust that owns the Clippers to singlehandedly make the deal.

Unexpected: Sterling, who had Alzheimer's diagnosed, told his wife 'Stay away from me you pig' during the hearing

In earlier testimony, two doctors hired by Mrs Sterling to examine him declared that the 80-year-old had Alzheimer's disease and was mentally incapable to act as administrator of the trust.

In his own testimony this week, Donald Sterling shouted from the witness stand that he would never sell the team.

On Tuesday, he alternately declared his love for his wife of 58 years, and then demeaned her as a woman intimidated by the 'bad NBA' and incapable of handling such a large financial transaction.

Before taking the witness stand, he kissed her.

But on Wednesday, he yelled 'get away from me, you pig!' when she tried to approach him after her first day of testimony.

The judge told Sterling his comments were 'somewhat distrurbing' and said: 'Please don't make any comments about your wife.'

Outside of court, Ballmer's lawyer Adam Streisand told USA Today: 'It was a shameful display by a seriously demented tyrant, ... his outburst, yelling at his wife ... was just hideous.'

Bobby Samini, who is representing Sterling, told the paper that 'emotions were really high'.

'I
 know that Donald felt very upset by watching her testimony. I think he 
felt betrayed by it. Obviously not a happy time for him,' Samini said.

NBA owners are scheduled to vote on 
the Ballmer deal next Tuesday. It's also the day that Ballmer's offer is
 set to expire - and there is no deal without the judge's approval of 
the sale.

If the sale isn't completed by September 15, the league said it could seize the team and put it up for auction.
