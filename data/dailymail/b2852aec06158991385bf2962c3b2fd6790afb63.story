Peter Capaldi makes his debut in Doctor Who tonight with a trip to Victorian London but if he was ever tempted to take the Tardis back to 1913 Glasgow, he could find himself in the middle of a real-life drama involving his own grandparents.

Researchers at the British Newspaper Archive have unearthed a report about the actor's grandfather Giovanni, who left his Italian village at the turn of the century and ended up in Scotland selling ice-cream.

The story, headlined 'Love Tragedy at Glasgow', tells how Giovanni's heart had been 'set aflame' by his landlady's daughter Agnes Dougan and he shot himself in the chest after she rejected him.

The report, from the Dundee Courier on January 27, said 'Capaldi solemnly informed the mother that if her daughter could live without him, he could not live without the daughter' before turning his gun on himself. 

He was taken to hospital with a bullet 'lodged underneath the heart' but survived and went on to marry Agnes weeks later.

The couple had five children, including Peter's father Gerard.

Amy Sell, a researcher from the British Newspaper Archive, said: 'Local newspaper archives can reveal fascinating information about where we come from. It's shocking to think that if Peter Capaldi's grandfather had not survived, we would be welcoming a different Doctor on to our screens tonight.' 

Capaldi's grandfather Giovanni was born in 1885 and had initially emigrated to the United States, but  instead went to England, before settling in Glasgow. 

Capaldi said in an earlier interview: 'I always thought it was funny that my grandparents had bought a ticket to New York and ended up in Glasgow.'

His grandparents married on February 20, 1913 - only a month after the shooting. 

Giovanni opened an icecream business in Glasgow, using his mother Nicolina's recipe. Later his father Gerry sold ice cream from a van around the city.  

Capaldi himself grew up across the road from fellow Scottish Italian actor Armando Iannucci in a tenement on Keppochhill Road in Glasgow's East End.

The story was covered by the Dundee Courier on January 27, 1913 according to the British Newspaper Archive
