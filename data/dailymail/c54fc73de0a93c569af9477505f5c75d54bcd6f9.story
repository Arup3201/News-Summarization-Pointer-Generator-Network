Sir Alex Ferguson ticked off another item on his bucket list as he attended the Oscars.

The retired former Manchester United manager was in jovial mood as he joined the star-studded cast of celebrities at the prestigious awards bash in Los Angeles.

And Ferguson wasn't the only celebrity with United connections at the awards ceremony. Irina shayk - the girlfriend of former Red Devils star Cristiano Ronaldo - was also in attendance in LA.

Film buff Fergie revealed he gave a pep 
talk to Lupita Nyong’o before she collected the acclaimed prize of best 
supporting actress for her role as Patsey in best film winner 12 Years A Slave.

‘I was in Row E, so it was good,' said Fergie, stopping for a chat on the red carpet to BBC Radio 5Live.

'I had a good seat. I've seen most of the stars but didn’t speak to any of them.

‘I spoke to some the night before at a party in Beverley Hills.

'I was chatting to Lupita [Nyong’o] and wished her all the best and she won.'

When he stepped down after 27 years in charge of champions United, Ferguson revealed he had a list of things he wanted to see and do with a trip to the Academy awards, right up there with his cruise around the Scottish Isles.

And he treated his wife Lady Cathy, who joined him at the Hollywood bash.

'I'm retired and I've got time on my hands now,' he said.

'I spoke to my lawyer and he said, "you must go to the Oscars sometime," so I got this opportunity.'

The 72-year-old is believed to have 
arranged the sought-after tickets through Hollywood chums and rates John
 Wayne's iconic Western, The Searchers among his most-watched.

‘My favourite films? Gone With The Wind, The Godfather, The Searchers,' he added.

'And a great movie, 12 Angry Men - I read a book, "100 Best Films" and it's not even in it, I couldn't believe it.'

Fergie had no complaints over the evening's big winner, 12 Years A Slave, though.

When asked whether the right film won, he said: 'Yes, 12 Years A Slave was a great movie. Matt McConaughey's performance in Dallas Buyers Club was sensational, so I think the awards were all correct.

‘I thought 12 Years A Slave was great, American Hustle was good and I enjoyed Captain Phillips, funnily enough and it wasn't even in the running for the awards but I enjoyed the movie.

'It's amazing [that Tom Hanks wasn't nominated] but he's had plenty!'

While he enjoys regular visits to the cinema, Ferguson laughed off the suggestion that he might swap his place in the Old Trafford directors box for the director's chair.

‘Be a director? No, no... I'm good at what I do,' he laughed.

Ferguson attended the Vanity Fair post-awards bash afterwards and revealed he was hoping to meet last year’s Best Actor winner for his part in Lincoln, Brit Daniel Day Lewis.

Ferguson said: ‘I'm hoping to meet Daniel Day Lewis. I think he's a great actor.'

No chance: Ferguson laughed off suggestions he might move in to the film industry

As he watched a host of awards being dished out in LA, Fergie hinted he was happy to miss United's 'noisy neighbours' Manchester City lift the Capital One Cup after their 3-1 Wembley win over Sunderland.

He said: ‘Well, they were always going to win it. They were the favourites.'
