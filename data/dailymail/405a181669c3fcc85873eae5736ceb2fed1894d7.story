Holidaymakers visiting a beach where at least 1,000 bombs have been found called yesterday for the sands to be closed to the public until the missiles have been removed.

Unsuspecting families were sunbathing on what has been dubbed Bomb Alley Beach as experts prepared to blow up more of the Second World War ordnance which tumbled out of the cliffs three-quarters of a mile away during a landslide on Saturday.

Fifteen controlled explosions were carried out on Sunday by the Royal Engineers, less than 24 hours after the rockets, grenades, and 20lb bombs were spotted by a dog walker at Mappleton, East Yorkshire.

A bomb disposal team has been called in to an East Yorkshire coastal landslip that revealed hundreds of Second World War munitions

The weapons, including rockets, mortars and 25lb (11kg) shells, could take days to clear

The missiles had buried themselves in
the earth cliffs after missing their target when the area was used as a
practice bombing range from the war until the early 1970s.

Although many are practice rounds 
they still contain explosive detonators and coastguards fear they may be
highly volatile after being buried in the cliffs for so many years.

A cordon was lifted yesterday morning
by Humberside Police who planned to seal off the beach again when the 
tide went out and the clear-up operation could resume.

Families heading for the beach yesterday morning said they had no idea there was any danger.

Joyce Nicholson, 65, who was with her
grandson Jack, 11, said: ‘I did not know anything about this. It’s 
disgusting they have not sorted this out in nearly 70 years. This place 
is very popular.

‘There needs to be more warning signs
and bigger warning signs especially this time of year when hundreds of 
children will be coming down. The whole beach should be closed really 
but I suppose they do not want to scare everybody.

‘It is not that far from the beach to where the bombs are and if they are blowing things up they really should tell people.’

The coastline was used as a practice bombing range during WWII and the 1970s

Mrs Nicholson said the only sign she 
had seen about the dangers of unexploded ordnance was an old rusty MoD 
one that people would not heed because it had been there for years.

Cori Angelique, from the Netherlands,
who planned to take children Bella, five, and Lany, three, to the 
sands, said she was also unaware anything was wrong.

Retired publican Steve Poppleton, 72,
who lives near the beach, said: ‘I have seen a few bombs at odd times 
but never anything like this.’

Humber Coastguard has warned the public to avoid the area and said anyone finding anything should dial 999.

A dog walker stumbled across the 
deadly find on Saturday afternoon but the emergency measures were only 
put into place yesterday when the tides allowed full checks of the 
beach.

The fins of many of the bombs have been left sticking out of the mud and rock which has fallen onto the beach.

With
holiday crowds flooding to the coast, coastguards are warning visitors 
thinking of grabbing a souvenir that the bombs may be 'highly volatile' 
and capable of 'causing serious injury or worse'.

Coastguards say the odd item of explosives often turn up in dribs and drabs after being embedded in the cliffs for decades.

But over the weekend, a landslip caused by the combination of heavy rain and coastal erosion exposed at least 1,000 weapons.

Coastguards say that most of them are probably dummy or practice rounds – but they still contain enough explosive to cause terrible injuries.

A 24-hour guard has been placed on the beach by Humberside Police amid fears that children may be tempted to pick up a 'trophy' during the school holidays.

An Army Bomb Disposal team from North 
Yorkshire’s Catterick Army Base has also been called in to clear the 
beach over the next few days.

The
Army experts are hoping to remove some of the smaller items for some 
will have to be blown up on site in controlled explosions, Humber 
Coastguard said.

Danger: Coastguards say that most of the devices are probably dummy or practice rounds – but they still contain enough explosives to cause terrible injuries. The devices include rockets and mortar bombs

They include rockets, mortar bombs and 25-pounder bombs which were all fired into the cliffs by RAF aircraft during the war years and have been there ever since.

Mike Puplett, watch manager at Humber Coastguard, said: 'It’s an old firing range from World War Two and an area where we do get explosives and grenades.

'When the cliff sinks it is a fairly regular occurrence that we get one or two. But there has been a fairly significant landslide occurred due to the erosion and bad weather which has caused it to slip.

'It is a conservative estimate of more than 1,000 items, a mixture of explosives. It is going to take two to three days if not longer to transport the less harmful explosives out of the way while those which are more dangerous or live are detonated in controlled explosions.'

There was no evacuation of the beach which was empty at the time of the landslip, he said, adding that the Coastguard were notified at 1.30pm on Saturday.

The beach can be approached along the sands from Hornsea or down a cliff top path but both points of access have been cordoned off.

'The explosives have been fired into the cliff for target practice during bombing runs in World War Two,' Mr Puplett continued.

'Most are practice rounds but the Army have advised us that the amount of explosives even in Low Explosive rounds make them highly dangerous to handle.

'Because they have been in the cliff so long they may have become volatile and dangerous after being expose to the fresh air.

'They have actually fallen in the landslip down onto the beach and are sticking out of the mud and rock and sand.

The East Riding beach of Mappleton, near Hornsea, was used as a practice bombing range during the Second World War

'Because there is such a great number of them what we do not want is people wandering around picking up the odd trophy to put on the mantel piece.

'They are all highly dangerous and should not be touched at all.  It is highly dangerous at the moment. I am no explosive expert but the Army have told me these things could cause serious injury if not worse and even Low Explosive rounds are dangerous.

'Even the dummy or practice rounds have some explosives in them. Anyone who finds anything like this should dial 999.'

Police said they located several hundred old shells, some measuring approximately 15ins long with fins on them on the beach, which lies just below the village of Mappleton.

The shells were found along the shoreline on Saturday at 4.45pm by a dog walker who called police.

Humberside Police said unfortunately due to high tide the area could only be partially checked by officers, and subsequently the shells were located by Bomb Disposal officers on Sunday.

The EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) from Catterick were asked to attend at 12 noon, and carried out approximately 15 controlled explosions on the beach. Other devices were removed by MOD staff at Leconfield, near Beverley, and further devices remain in situ, which are not considered an immediate risk, to be dealt with today once the tide is low again.

Cordon:
Fifteen explosions were carried out at the East Riding beach of 
Mappleton, near Hornsea, after a dog walker stumbled across the arsenal 
yesterday which has been embedded in the cliffs for more than 60 years

Weapon: A missile shaped bomb found after being embedded in the cliffs for decades

Insp Mark Coulthard, of Humberside Police, said 'Although not live munitions, they do pose a danger as they have flash charges in them.

'I would advise any member of the public finding such an item to ensure that they leave it alone and phone the police to notify us, so that we can arrange the necessary measures to make them safe.

'On no account, should any person pick these items up and take them home.

'The likelihood of more finds is high, as coastal erosion washing away some of the cliffs, and unearths more munitions.'
