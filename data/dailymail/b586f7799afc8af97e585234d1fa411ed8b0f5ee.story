Rangers interim executive chairman David Somers has hinted Derek Llambias may not end up being the club's new chief executive.

Somers has stepped up from his non-executive role to take full command of the Scottish League One champions for the time being as they search for former chief executive Graham Wallace's replacement.

It was thought that role would go to Mike Ashley's right-hand man Llambias following the Newcastle owner's Ibrox power grab.

Derek Llambias is working as a consultant for Rangers, but may not become the new chief executive

So far the club has only confirmed that the former Magpies managing director is acting as a consultant along with Barry Leach, another Ashley associate.

But Somers admitted to Sky Sports News on Thursday morning that Llambias is yet to even apply for the Light Blues' top job.

He said: 'I don't think I should say (how many people have applied for the chief executive role) at this point. I have got some head-hunters helping me look for people.

'I can't confirm that (Llambias has applied). That would be unfair of me to say who has applied and who hasn't. As you can imagine it is really early days.

'I was looking at his CV but he hasn't actually applied. He hasn't actually said anything to me. He is here as a consultant.'

Interim boss David Somers said Llambias has not even applied for the role yet, but he had looked at his CV

Somers' new role was confirmed in an early-morning announcement to the Stock Exchange.

As well as finding someone to fill Wallace's old role, the chartered accountant will also lead the search for Philip Nash's replacement as finance director.

Both men were forced out of the club after Ashley's succeeded in having a £2million loan accepted by the cash-strapped Glasgow giants.

The terms of the facility now gives him the power to name their replacements - although the Scottish Football Association is now set to investigate the latest developments in the Ibrox saga.

Any attempt to place Llambias and Leach on the board could fall foul of Ashley's agreement with Hampden chiefs, which was designed to limit the Sports Direct tycoon's influence at Ibrox while he remains in control of Newcastle.

Ashley signed the agreement, which restricts him to a share of no more than 10 per cent, in 2012. He currently holds an 8.92 per cent stake.

The cameras are on Llambias as he arrives at Ibrox to take up his new role as consultant

The stock exchange statement said: 'David Somers, non-executive chairman, will become executive chairman of Rangers on a temporary basis with immediate effect.

'In this role, he will liaise directly with senior staff within the club about the operation of the business, and he will oversee the recruitment of a new chief executive and finance director.'

But Somers, who was appointed as Rangers' acting chairman in November last year and was re-elected at the club's AGM the following month, refused to put a time-scale on his recruitment drive.

He said: 'The board have asked me to lead the search for a new chief exec and also for a finance director.

'And obviously we are having a look at everything with the consultants. It's a good opportunity to dig into everything while we are appointing these people.

'We have got to do these things properly. We have got to make sure we get the right guy. Obviously I would like to do it as fast as possible but at the same time I need to make sure I get the right person for Rangers.

'We may put an interim finance director in, just to fill the gap. It's the same for this role, we need the right person.'
