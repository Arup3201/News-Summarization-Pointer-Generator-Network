The old stereotype is that it’s grim up north. Not so, according to a recent happiness survey... it’s more likely to be miserable in the smoke.

Residents of towns such as Harrogate, Hull and Preston are the most satisfied with where they live.

Researchers asked nearly 50,000 homeowners how they felt about the safety and neighbourliness of their area and how proud they felt of their property, along with several other measurements of happiness.

Harrogate, the spa town famous for ‘healing’ mineral waters, was crowned as the happiest place to live in Britain for the second year in a row.

In stark contrast to last year, more northern towns made it into the top ten, including Stockport, Inverness and Falkirk.

And the survey by Rightmove showed someone living in Hull or Preston is generally happier with their surroundings than someone residing in London or in Oxford.

Southern towns such as Croydon, Twickenham, Harrow and East London were named as the places where people are least happy.

But last year, the majority of towns ranked most happiest to live in were towns in the south, including Exeter, Ipswich, Kingston Upon Thames and Bath.

Ilford, East London, East Central London and Croydon made it in the bottom ten for the second year running.

The survey asked people questions such as how proud they are of their home, whether they are satisfied with how it is decorated, how safe they feel in their community, whether they have enough living space, how friendly the neighbours are and whether they worry about the value of their property.

Despite the booming property market in London and the average price tag in the capital standing at around £459,000, the 10 places where people reported the lowest levels of satisfaction with where they live were all situated within the capital.

East London was named as the place where people are least happy out of all 111 places ranked, with Ilford, Croydon, East Central London, Twickenham, Harrow and West London also making the bottom 10 list.

East Londoners ranked their area bottom of the survey for neighbourliness and were also the least satisfied with their home decoration, while those living in Croydon voted their area the least safe place to live.

Meanwhile trendy East London remained the least happy place to live, with locations in the capital filling up the bottom of the league tables

The popular London commuter belt areas of St Albans and Guildford came in 12th and 13th place respectively in terms of the happiest places to live.

Oxford came in 44th place in the happiness rankings and Cambridge was positioned at number 59.

This put both cities behind Newport in South Wales which was at number 42 and Middlesbrough in the North East which was at number 39.

Rightmove said Harrogate, where the average asking price is £309,133, scored top in the survey for safety, its sense of neighbourliness and recreation.

Councillor Michael Newby, Mayor of the Borough of Harrogate, said: ‘The district has some of the most beautiful countryside in the UK, if not in Europe and beyond.

‘There is also a great community feel, which certainly makes life a lot happier for many people.’ The survey also found that people living in Kirkcaldy in Fife feel they have the most space to live in comfortably, while those living in West Central London feel they have the least.

Rightmove found that someone living in the Kirkcaldy area could buy a six-bedroom house with eight acres of land for less than £800,000, but in West Central London this amount of money would only stretch to buy a one-bedroom flat.

Meanwhile, people living in Preston, Lancashire were found to take the greatest pride in their home.

Nottingham home owners were found to be least worried about the value of their property, and people living in Hereford were the most likely to say they are contented within their current property rather than moving somewhere else.

Residents living in Blackburn, Lancashire were the most likely to say they choose to spend money on their home even if they do not have to.
