No sooner had Jon Stewart left Daily Show fans gobsmacked with his decision to bow out after 16 years at Comedy Central than the race has begun to find someone with the right credentials to adequately replace him.

'This show doesn't deserve an even slightly restless host and neither do you,' he told his audience on Tuesday night. He said he might depart in July, September or maybe December.  

Stewart's passion, wit and boldness make for a magical combination that will be difficult to re-create when he steps away later this year.

No sooner had Jon Stewart left Daily Show fans gobsmacked with his decision to bow out after 16 years than the race has begun to find someone with the right credentials to adequately replace him 

Big shoes to fill: Late-night television is long overdue a female host and Amy Schumer could be the ideal candidate, while hosting The Daily Show could be just the reinvention Brian Williams needs

An early favorite to replace Stewart is British comedian John Oliver who stood in for him in 2013, but left soon after to host a similar show at HBO

'The X-factor here is Stewart's charisma. It's significant,' said Sophia McClennen, a Penn State professor and author of Is Satire Saving Our Nation?: Mockery And American Politics. 

The Daily Show averages just slightly more than 1 million viewers a night - a far smaller audience than his late-night competition on the big networks - but during his time as host Stewart has became disproportionately influential in U.S. politics and culture. 

Under Stewart, the show has won 18 Emmys, taking home the award for Best Variety Series every year from 2003 to 2012. It also won two Peabody Awards, for its election coverage in 2000 and 2004.

In a 2004 poll by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, 21 percent of respondents aged 18 to 29 cited The Daily Show as a regular source of political news.

The Daily Show boot camp has graduated a number of impressive talents who might prove to be worthy of the host chair, McClennen said, counting John Oliver first among a group including Aasif Mandvi, Samantha Bee and Jason Jones.

There are outsiders who certainly have the comedic chops. But do they have the star power and the backbone to speak punchlines to power, and on a nightly basis?

Possible successors: Jessica Williams is already The Daily Show's 'senior youth' correspondent, while Chris Rock is an established comedian known for his outspoken views on modern America 

Daily Show regulars Samantha Bee and Jason Jones are other names that have been thrown in the hat as the search begins to replace Jon Stewart

Looking over the possibilities, here are some candidates to consider:

Ex-SNL alumnae Tina Fey and Amy Poehler have been mentioned as possible replacements for Jon Stewart 

Other names in the frame for The Daily Show include Aisha Tyler and Joel McHale

Stewart announced on Tuesday that after 16 years he will step down from Comedy Central's The Daily Show later in the year

@highlight

Hunt is now on to find someone worthy of filling the enormous hole he is leaving behind

@highlight

Early favorite is British comedian John Oliver who stood in for Stewart in 2013, but left soon after to host a similar show at HBO

@highlight

List of potential replacements also includes Tina Fey, Chris Rock, Amy Schumer and even disgraced NBC anchor Brian Williams 

@highlight

John Oliver: He's top of the list for a reason: He proved he could emerge from the Daily Show ranks and succeed as host when Stewart took a movie-making break. Oliver and his dimples defected to HBO, but his return home would be triumphant.

@highlight

Tina Fey or Amy Poehler: Paired for efficiency's sake given their frequent collaborations. Like Stewart and Oliver, they've got the likability that helps make hard-hitting satire palatable — and how about at least one woman in late-night TV?

@highlight

Amy Schumer: There is a growing argument that late-night television is long overdue a female host. The vacancy at The Daily Show could be an ideal opportunity for Schumer, whose Comedy Central series premiere in 2013 was the network’s most-watched premiere that year.

@highlight

Chris Hardwick: A growing star at Comedy Central where he already hosts the social media-oriented show @midnight. The comedian also has a regular gig fronting Walking Dead spin-off The Talking Dead. Could be a strong contender because of his youthful fan base.

@highlight

Chris Rock: Brilliantly funny, certainly fearless. He wrote an essay about being black in an entertainment industry that is 'kind of racist' in its hiring practices — although he said he wasn't being political at all, adding, 'that's Stewart, that's (Bill) Maher.' 

@highlight

Seth MacFarlane: He's a writer, performer and singer who can summon the juvenile glee, if not the artfulness, that Stewart employs to leaven the angst. And he could bring a sidekick, his devilish movie creation Ted the teddy bear.

@highlight

Aisha Tyler: An experienced all-rounder with talent to spare. She co-hosts The Talk, has acted in series including Ghost Whisperer, CSI, Talk Soup and Friends and also hosts Whose Line is it Anyway?

@highlight

Jessica Williams: A Daily Show player whose titles include 'senior youth' and 'senior Beyonce' correspondent, she's brimming with energy and edgy charm. Whether she has the experience and heft to step into the center ring is an open question. 

@highlight

Aasif Mandvi, Samantha Bee and Jason Jones: Experienced Daily Show regulars but when Stewart took a break during the Summer of 2013 to direct his movie Rosewater, it was their colleague Oliver who was trusted in the big chair. 

@highlight

Joel McHale: The Soup host already balances his Community sitcom role with a host gig, so why not step it up? He's quick witted, lovable and has a following that encompasses the frat-boy demo that is undeniably part of the Daily Show fan base. 

@highlight

Brian Williams: The disgraced NBC Nightly News host has technically been sacked but is starting a six month suspension. Williams may use his extended break to reconsider where his career is going and isn't it his desire to be considered more than just a news anchor that got him into trouble in the first place? Could be just the reinvention he needs.
