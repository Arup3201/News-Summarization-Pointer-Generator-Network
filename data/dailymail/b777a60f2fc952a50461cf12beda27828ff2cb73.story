Seemingly always on the go, Cara Delevingne’s work-hard-party-harder lifestyle shows no signs of slowing down.

And despite the supermodel's slightly wild reputation, the 21-year-old appears to be focusing more on her career of late.

The wild child missed out on Glastonbury this week to meet with music mogul Simon Cowell to talk about her rumoured singing career - and she has just released a new campaign for Mulberry, in which she carries bags from her own collection.

The shoot also nods to the long-standing British tradition of weekends in the countryside

The atmospheric shoot for Mulberry’s A/W14 saw the brand returned to its roots in the British countryside.

Shot by Tim Walker, Cara looks pensive and mature as she poses against the backdrop of the Scottish Highlands’ bleak undulating hills, languishing against rocks and sitting in the long grass, modelling bags from the Cara Delevingne collection.

The classic and elegant clothing for Autumn Winter 2014 contains British staples like argyle, knitwear and iconic Houndstooth and check, all influenced by traditional tailoring, textures and prints.

Even the footwear references two key 
British styles – the all-purpose Rain Boot, beloved by country-dwellers 
and city-commuters alike, and the quintessential lace-up brogue.

The model has even inspired her own capsule collection for the upcoming season.

The Cara Delevingne Collection, infused with Cara’s own cool style, was designed to fit in with both days spent in the town or country.

Ahead of the launch of the collection this September, luxury label Mulberry has released a film taking a look at Cara’s creative journey from the collection’s concept at Mulberry’s head office in London, to craft at The Rookery, Mulberry’s flagship factory in Somerset.

For the collection, Cara visited the archives, choosing leathers, sketching ideas and discussing the practical needs she had for a multi-functional bag.

The supermodel even used her famous tattoos as inspiration with the lion inking inspiring the studs on the bags and her 'made in England' design being printed onto the bottom of her arm candy.

Tim Walker and Ronnie Cooke Newhouse chose the Scottish Highlands as the location for the campaign shoot for its dense beauty and intense landscapes. 

As well as fronting the A/W 2014 Mulberry campaign, Cara has even turned designer for the brand, helping to create her own collection

Animal-lover Cara loved filming on location in the Scottish Highlands surrounded by lambs and sheep 

The Mulberry team and Cara apparently stayed in a Scottish lodge and woke up every day to early morning mists, huge breakfasts, homemade shortbread and wild land to the location for the shoot.

Cara, who has made no secret of her love of animals, often seen carrying her pet rabbit Cecil with her, reportedly fell in love with one of the lambs that were roaming around the production team as they shot the campaign in an isolated spot.

The fact that this project is one of many Cara has on the go at the moment is perhaps why she has chosen to slightly pare back her partying over the last two weeks.

The model, who rarely stays in the same place more than a couple of nights, spoke about her hectic schedule to The Telegraph: ‘When people described things to me as a whirlwind, I never really knew what it meant, but then you get inside the tornado and you know exactly what it is. It’s madness.

‘You get so caught up in so many things that it can be difficult to find the time to say, “Am I actually okay with this? Am I happy?".'
