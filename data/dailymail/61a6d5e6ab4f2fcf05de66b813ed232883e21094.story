A  boat skipper has learned a risky party trick for entertaining his paying guests: leaping on to the back of sharks and attempting to ride them.

Aaron Moir pulled off the stunt in a recent video filmed off the coast of Exmouth, Western Australia, which showed him jumping on to the back of a 3 metre hammerhead shark.

The stunt has been condemned by environmentalists, who have deemed it reckless and cruel, but Mr Moir stood by his actions and said he planned to try it again with a great white.

The 25-year-old, who said it was his seventh shark riding escapade, was operating a tour boat for Blue Juice Charters when the video was filmed, reports Nine News.

'Well I seen (sic) it and I felt like putting that song 'Hammertime' on – dun nu nu nu,' Mr Moir said.

'But I did jump on it, it was pretty nerve-wracking at the end.'

Despite cutting his legs on the skin of the animal, the self-proclaimed 'shark rider' defended the stunt and said he or the shark was never in any danger.

'I don't have much experience with great whites at all, so I'd love to jump in with one of them, but I'll wait till I know a bit more about them,' he said.

Western Australian Fisheries said that since hammerhead sharks are not protected, Mr Moir did not break any laws in the clip

Meanwhile, environmentalists have condemned the video, deeming it disgraceful and likely to incite an attack. 

Western Australian Fisheries  said that since hammerhead sharks are not protected, Mr Moir did not break any laws in the clip.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted West Australians for Shark Conservation for comment, but they were unavailable at the time of publication.

The video joins a string of similar clips coming from Western Australia in recent weeks. Earlier this month, video surfaced of a man leaping onto a tiger shark somewhere in Australia as a dare.
