A spiritual adviser to the New Hampshire man accused of strangling a female college student to death while raping her has taken the stand in his trial.

Roberta Gerkin took the stand for the second day in Seth Mazzaglia's trial for the killing of 19-year-old college student Elizabeth 'Lizzi' Marriott on October 9, 2012.

Gerkin testified that she was invited to Mazzaglia's apartment shortly after murder and saw Marriot's body with two plastic bags tied over her head, according to WMUR.

Testy: Defense attorney Joachim Barth cross examines testimony Monday from witness Roberta Gerkin at Strafford Superior Court in Dover, N.H., during the murder trial of Seth Mazzaglia

Victim: Police say Elizabeth 'Lizzi' Marriott (left and right), the 19-year-old killed during an attempted sexual assault on October 9 in Dover, New Hampshire, was the victim of a violent strip poker threesome

The spiritual adviser was asked whether she thought Mazzaglia, 31, would 'do the right thing' and call an ambulance, as well as if he displayed any remorse over the teen's death.

Her testimony became testy as she sparred with a defense lawyer over the meaning of the word 'ligature' and whether she saw marks on Marriot's wrists that would show a ligature was used.

'If I do not know what a ligature is, how do I know what is like a ligature?' She snapped at the attorney when he tried to prove her previous testimony false.

A ligature is material used to tie or bind, and would have been used to tie her wrists, likely leaving a mark.

Prosecutors have charged Mazzaglia with rape and murder, but he maintains she died during rough consensual sex.

Marriott, of Westborough, Massachusetts, was a student at the University of New Hampshire and was lured to Mazzaglia's apartment by his then-girlfriend, Kathryn McDonough, it is claimed.

Prosecutors claim that Mazzaglia 
choked Marriott from behind with a rope while she sat on a couch in his
 apartment on Mill Street in Dover.

Assistant
 Attorney General Peter Hinckley told the jury on Wednesday that after 
Marriott could no longer object to Mazzaglia's sexual advances because 
of the choking, he pushed her underwear out of the way and raped her 
while McDonough, 19, did nothing to help.

Hinckley portrayed Mazzaglia as a bondage, domination and sadomasochism 'master' who treated McDonough as a 'submissive slave.'

He also said Mazzaglia ordered McDonough to find him another woman to dominate in a sexual way before meeting Marriott.

The couple even posted ads online looking for a sexual slave to do light housework, it was alleged.

Yesterday Brittany Atwood, 26, described as Marriott's first girlfriend, took to the witness stand.

Atwood
 told Hinckley that she became good friends with Marriott in January 
2012 and they became romantically involved in February or March.

They met while working at a Stop and Shop in Massachusetts.

She described Marriott as beautiful, kindheated, caring, trusting, goofy, silly and experimental.

Atwood
 said the last message she received from Marriott was at 8.55pm on the 
night she was allegedly murdered. It said: 'You're so cute!'

Atwood said she then sent Marriott two text messages - one at 8.59pm and one at 9.06pm but Marriott never responded.

Atwood said became worried the next morning when she had not heard from Marriott and contacted her parents.

After the police were contacted, Atwood told them Marriott was planning to meet McDonagh after her chemistry lab class.

However, during cross examination, public defender Melissa Davis asked Atwood if Marriott was also into 'fantasy type stuff'.

According to Atwood, Marriott like anime and video games like World of Warcraft. She was also into Game of Thrones.

'She was also experimental, so if she wanted to try something, she was going to try it,' Davis said.

She also asked Atwood whether she had been told Marriott was playing strip poker with McDonoughand Mazzaglia.

'You did not get a text message that strip poker was being played?' Davis asked.

'No,' Atwood said.

'You did not know that she was playing strip poker?' Davis asked.

'No,' Atwood said.

'You didn't know she was playing strip poker that night until much later,' Davis said.

'I didn't know at all,' Atwood said.

Recently released court documents describe the couple's interviews with police starting three days after Marriott disappeared.

First
 Mazzaglia said Marriott had never made it to their place that night — 
he had gone out for a run, hurt his ankle and was slow returning to the 
house.

McDonough told police she went to a nearby cemetery in hopes of capturing images of ghosts with her digital camera.

But Mazzaglia's story soon began to change.

In an interview later the same day, he talked of bondage and sadomasochism.

He
 implicated McDonough and another couple in harming Marriott, saying 
when he arrived home Marriott had a ligature mark around her neck.

He suggested another man had done something terrible, but he wouldn't say what.

Finally,
 police said, Mazzaglia admitted he was involved. He and McDonough were 
playing strip poker with Marriott and that led to intercourse.

Mazzaglia said he was having sex with Marriott — and tightening a rope around her neck — when she had a 'seizure.'

Mazzaglia told investigators neither he nor McDonough tried to revive Marriott or summon help.

Instead, he told them, he put a grocery bag over her head and tied it at the neck.

Mazzaglia
 told investigators he and McDonough used Marriott's 2001 Mazda to take 
her body to Peirce Island in Portsmouth, where they threw it and her 
cellphone into the Piscataqua River.

When
 Marriott's torso remained above water, he said, McDonough went into the
 water and pushed it under, making a joke about 'Davy Jones' locker.'

The
 pair then drove Marriott's car to UNH, left it in a student lot and 
discarded her belongings in trash bins, authorities allege.

Mazzaglia
 was arrested October 13 — a day after he was interviewed — and 
McDonough on Christmas Eve. He is being held without bond, charged with 
first-degree murder.

She has been indicted on charges of conspiracy and hindering prosecution.

She was released on $35,000 bond on the condition she live with her parents in Portsmouth.

Family members describe Marriott as 'gullible' - someone who easily could be taken advantage of because of her trusting nature.

One family friend from Westborough, Mass., where Marriott grew up, called her naive.

'She
 was just a good girl. That's probably what got her in trouble,' Dawn 
Downey said. 'She was too trusting and she was beautiful. Those two 
things will kill you.'
