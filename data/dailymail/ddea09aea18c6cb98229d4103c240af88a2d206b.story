Daphne Guinness has launched an angry tirade against her grandmother's biographer, calling her a 'charlatan' in a furious Twitter outburst.

The 47-year-old accused author Lyndsy Spence of being a 'scurrilous profiteer' after she penned a book about socialite Diana Mitford, the most controversial of the six Mitford sisters. 

In the series of tweets to her 93,500 followers, she also defended her grandmother - who famously fell for the charms of fascist leader Sir Oswald Mosley - for simply 'falling in love'.

The 47-year-old accused Lyndsy Spence of being a 'charlatan' for publishing The Rise and Fall of Diana Mitford

Ms Spence, who is also the founder of the Mitford Society, has published Mrs Guinness: The Rise and Fall of Diana Mitford.

Ms Guinness wrote: 'I am a Mitford and I detest you.'

She then added: 'This is completely scurrilous. I am sick of people making money and writing about my family... I KNOW what they do NOT.

'My grandmother committed no crime, she fell in LOVE. And she was in prison for 4 years... aged 23... revising history is easy for CHARLATANS.' 

Ms Spence has since rebuffed Guinness' criticisms, insisting her book is 'one of the few which displays Diana in a sympathetic light'. 

Diana, known as Honks,  left her first husband Bryan Guinness and married the founder of the British Union of Fascists, Oswald Mosley. 

The socialite's descendent expressed her anger in a series of  tweets sent to her 93,500 followers

They tied the knot in a civil ceremony in Joseph Goebbels' drawing room in Berlin in 1936. Hitler was the only other guest.

As a result, during World War Two, Diana was locked up as an enemy to the Allies in Holloway Prison.

Mary S. Lovell, who has previously written a biography on the Mitford sisters, said Diana 'became arguably the most hated woman in England for a while'.

But Diana wasn't the only Mitford with polarising political views. Decca was once an outspoken supporter of communism while Unity was also a fan of Hitler.

Both she and Diana attended the Nuremberg Nazi rally of 1933 and Unity was said to have become fascinated with the leader. 

Although many hated the sisters for their political alliances, others admired them for their wit and beauty. 

The last of the famous Mitford sisters, Deborah, Dowager Duchess of Devonshire, died at the age of 94 in September.
