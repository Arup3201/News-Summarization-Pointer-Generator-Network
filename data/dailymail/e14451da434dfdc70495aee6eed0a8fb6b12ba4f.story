On the two-year anniversary of the disappearance of a mother of three in Orlando, Florida, police have announced that they are set to reveal new evidence relating to the disappearance of Michelle Parker.

Just hours after appearing on The People's Court in a dispute with her ex-fiance in 2011, Parker vanished, now police have announced that they will be holding a press conference on Monday to unveil 'new, never disclosed video evidence' relating to her disappearance.

Mother of three, Parker disappeared on November 17, 2011 after dropping off her two youngest children - three-year-old twins - with their father, her ex-fiance Dale Smith.

New evidence: Michelle Parker disappeared two years ago after appearing on The People's Court with her ex-finance Dale Smith, new police have revealed they have new video evidence

Earlier that day, the couple had appeared on an episode of The People's Court in a dispute over a lost $5,000 engagement ring.

In the weeks after her disappearance, Parker's family and friends helped law enforcement conduct extensive searches, reports The Orlando Sentinel.

Her black Hummer was found abandoned at an apartment complex and her cell phone was discovered underwater near a bridge, but no trace of the 33-year-old ever emerged.

Orlando police Chief Paul Rooney referred to Smith as the prime suspect in Parker's disappearance, but he has never been charged.

Crusading mother: Michelle Parker's mother, Yvonne Stewart, filed a wrongful death lawsuit in March claiming that Smith is to blame for the disappearance of the woman, who is presumed deadÂ 

Weeks after the disappearance, Smith was given full custody of the couple's young twins. Parker's mother, Yvonne Stewart, has unsuccessfully tried to get custody of the children.

In March, she filed a wrongful death lawsuit against her daughter's former fiance. She is seeking damages totaling over $15,000, alleging that 
Smith was 'negligent or otherwise committed a wrongful act and caused 
the death' of the woman.

Her body has never been found, but 
the lawsuit claims that the 33-year-old 'died on or about November 17, 
2011 as a direct and proximate result of the negligence of the 
defendant.'

'[Yvonne Stewart] doesn't want to 
believe it happened, but everyone knows what happened and when it 
happened,' Parker estate attorney John Morgan said to ABCNews.com. 'We 
think she was killed.'

The lawyer claims he is in possession 
of text messages between Parker and Smith, as well as other evidence 
that he would no further elaborate on, saying that he does not want 
Smith to be 'ready for that.'

Dispute: Michelle Parker appeared on The People's Court to dispute an engagement ring with ex-fiance Dale Smith. The program aired two years ago and on the same day Parker disappeared

'We'll be most interested when we get a chance to depose him,' Morgan said. 'Will he take the fifth or tell the truth?'

Smith's attorney, Mark Nejame, 
insists that Morgan and Parker's family have nothing to connect his 
client to the woman's disappearance.

'They're barking up the wrong tree,' 
Nejame said. 'They've been frustrated for a long time because law 
enforcement hasn't found a scintilla of evidence that ties him to her 
disappearance or murder... Just because everyone thinks he did it doesn't
 mean he did it.'

The lawyer said that Smith 
voluntarily spoke to police on four separate occasions and submitted to a
 full home inspection just hours after his ex-fiancee was reported 
missing.

'Our hearts go out to Michelle 
Parker's family, truly, but sadly a lawsuit against Dale Smith is not 
going to bring them any closer to finding out what happened to Michelle 
Parker,' he said.

'Rocky': The couple's relationship was described as 'tense' by friends

The attorney described his client as a
 good father to his five-year-old twins. Parker's 11-year-old son lives 
with his father in Pennsylvania.

The grandparents have a written 
agreement with Smith for the custody of the children, but Stewart has 
been pushing for clearer rights established and legal right to petition
 the court for visitation.

Stewart's missing daughter had a very stormy relationship with Smith.

Police conducted a night-time raid on Smith's father's home during investigations but would not comment on the findings of the search or and what sparked the raid.

Parker's friend Angela Launer told ABCNews.com: 'I know he hurt her many times - dropped her off in areas with no shoes. Took off and left her in Georgia by herself.'

Launer, 34, said the relationship was 'rocky' and 'tense.'

She said: 'He hurt my best friend. I didn't like him because he made her cry. No one should ever be treated that way.'

Parker applied for a restraining order from Smith in 2009, but was denied one for lack of evidence.

It has also been revealed that Smith was dishonorably discharged from the Marines in 2003 after several court martials, including military convictions for drug possession and domestic battery, reports Huffington Post.

On the TV show Parker and Smith argued over whether Parker had to pay for a $5,000 engagement ring she tossed away during one of their arguments. The judge ruled the two should split the cost.

Parker's family began to realize something was wrong when her 11-year-old son let the family know that he was home from school and his mother was not there.

Launer said: 'She would never have taken off, done that to her brother, sister or mother... that's why we're crying every day.'
