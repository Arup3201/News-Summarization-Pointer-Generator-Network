A soldier whose bravery helped change the course of World War Two has died.

John Stone was a mine expert who carried out a daring reconnaissance mission of the Normandy beaches just before the D-Day landings.

Hero: John Stone, a D-Day hero whose bravery helped change the course of World War Two has died

Wearing dark clothing, he crept up the beach and got to within 40 yards of German soldiers while he examined deadly bombs they had laid.

He discovered wooden poles with anti-tank mines on top positioned along the shoreline that would have been hidden at high tide and devastated landing craft.

Upon his return to England he was debriefed and his intelligence made Winston Churchill and Dwight D Eisenhower change the invasion from high to low tide to avoid the traps.

As a result thousands more soldiers made it safely to shore along the five Normandy beaches on D-Day, giving the Allies a strong foothold on Nazi-occupied Europe.

For his bravery Mr Stone, who was a 22-year-old Sapper Lieutenant, was awarded the Military Cross.

He also received a congratulatory telegram from Winston Churchill.

After leaving the army, Mr Stone worked as a consultant engineer before retiring to Weymouth, Dorset.

He recently developed prostate cancer and passed away at his home aged 89.

He died on November 10 and the following day, Armistice Day, his daughter Tomina attended a Remembrance Day service in honour of her father.

In an interview he gave in 2004, Mr Stone recalled the mission he carried out with a sergeant and a corporal.

Aircraft reconnaissance photos had revealed suspected staked mines on the beaches but army chiefs needed to know what kind they were.

His team was taken by motor torpedo boat across the Channel and they then got into a dinghy to make their way ashore at night-time.

Escorted by commandos, the three engineers crept up the beach to inspect the defences.

Mr Stone said: ‘It did not all go to plan. When we got into our dinghy it capsized and we had to wade the rest of the way.’

He added: ‘We saw sentries patrolling and we got to within about 40 yards of one smoking a cigarette.

‘A searchlight passed over us several times, but they never saw us.’ The group identified the mines as anti-tank devices.

Mr Stone said: ‘If they had gone in at high tide it would have knocked the bottom of the landing craft out and sunk them before they got to the beaches.

‘As I understand it, the information we brought back led to the timing of D-Day being changed from high to low water. And our measurements showed our tanks were able to go between the poles on the beach.’

Mr Stone was a modest man and his widow Nora, 87, whom he married in 1946, said he only spoke of his heroics when pressed. She said: ‘I was very proud of him.’

Top honour: Stone was awarded the Military Cross for his bravery as he helped save thousands of lives
