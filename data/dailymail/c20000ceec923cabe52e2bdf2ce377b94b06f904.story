Posing for a holiday picture surrounded by his daughter and girlfriend,Â Roman Seleznev looks nothing more than an ordinary family man.

But U.S. federal prosecutors believe the 30-year-old Russian national is in fact a criminal mastermind responsible for one of the biggest credit card hacking scams in history.

Seleznev was allegedly seized by American secret service agents while 
returning to Moscow from a vacation in the Maldives before being bundled onto a plane and flown to Guam where he was arrested.

Authorities allege that he hacked into computers at 
hundreds of retail businesses including the Phoenix Zoo collecting credit card numbers.

But family members insist he is innocent and fear incarceration will kill him.

Seleznev's father Valery, a prominent Russian lawmaker,
 told a news conference today that his son, who was left 
brain-damaged after a 2011 bombing in Marrakech, will die without his 
medication.

'There are no medical services there at all, treatment is not available,' Seleznev said. When asked how his son is going to manage without prescription drugs the lawmaker said: 'He will die.'

Seleznev's father said a lawyer has spoken to his son and that he is 'in good spirits'.

Seleznev's
 girlfriend, Anna Otisko, said she was with him when he was grabbed by 
unknown men at the airport in the Maldives and put on the plane out of 
the country.

The
 Russian foreign ministry has accused Washington of kidnapping the man. 
U.S. officials have declined to say how or where he was apprehended.

The
 man's relatives insist that Seleznev was arrested because of a 
'horrendous mistake' and was neither mentally nor physically able to 
engage in the intricate hacking schemes. The charges, however, date back
 to the time before he was injured.

According to an indictment unsealed Monday, Seleznev, known by the underground name 'Track2,' carried out a scheme to hack into retailers' computers, install malicious software and steal credit card numbers from 2009 to 2011.

He is accused of marketing and selling those stolen credit card numbers on 'criminally inspired websites' and using servers in Virginia, Russia, Ukraine and other parts of the world to help carry out the scheme.

In March 2011, a grand jury in Washington state indicted Seleznev on charges of bank fraud, obtaining information from a protected computer, aggravated identity theft, trafficking in unauthorized access devices and possessing stolen credit card numbers.

Seleznev's targets allegedly included several small businesses like Broadway Grill, in Seattle, where he could steal credit card information

The 
Washington indictment accuses him of hacking into computers at the 
Broadway Grill in Seattle and stealing 32,000 unique credit card numbers
 between December 2009 and October 2010.

Seleznev
 is also accused of stealing credit card data from 'hundreds of retail 
businesses' throughout the U.S. They include several others in Western 
Washington, along with Schlotzsky's Deli in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho; Mary's
 Pizza Shack in Sonoma, California; Latitude Bar and Grill in New York; 
and the Phoenix Zoo, according to the indictment.

The 
indictment says Seleznev stole more than 200,000 credit card numbers and
 sold more than 140,000, generating more than $2 million in profits.

It
 was unclear whether consumers or banks were notified that the card 
numbers had been stolen. A call to the Secret Service on Tuesday 
afternoon was not immediately returned.

The
 Russian Foreign Ministry in a statement Tuesday described Seleznev's 
arrest as 'yet another unfriendly gesture' of the United States.

Neither
 are we notified of charges against our compatriots, nor were Russian 
consulate offices informed of Seleznev's arrest,' the statement said.

U.S. security officials allege Seleznev is behind attacks compromising thousands of consumer credit cards

The ministry said it was waiting for the U.S. to explain the incident and allow Russian consulate staff to visit Seleznev.

Moscow
 also blamed Maldives officials for ignoring 'international legal norms'
 and allowing 'intelligence services of another state to kidnap a 
Russian citizen and take him out of the country.'

In
 Washington, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki disputed the 
Russian Foreign Ministry description of the matter, saying, 'Certainly, 
no kidnapping took place.'

Seleznev
 was indicted in Washington state in March 2011 on charges including 
bank fraud, causing damage to a protected computer, obtaining 
information from a protected computer and aggravated identity theft, the
 U.S. agency said in a statement.

The
 indictment said Seleznev hacked into websites ranging from those run by
 the Phoenix Zoo, a branch of Schlotzsky's Deli and many other small 
restaurants and entertainment venues around the country.

Relations
 between Russia and the United States are at a low ebb in Vladimir 
Putin's third term as president, with the former Cold War enemies 
divided over the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine as well as on human 
rights, democracy and defence matters.
