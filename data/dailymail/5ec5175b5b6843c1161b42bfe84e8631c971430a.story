Astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope have seen a horrifying glimpse of the destructive power of solar flares, as a huge X-Ray flare 'boiled off' the atmosphere of a distant planet.

Our own sun's flares are usually only powerful enough to disrupt radio communications on Earth, but a new sunspot group - AR 1520 - is one of the biggest in years, and may bombard Earth next week.

Just
 after a violent flare on its parent star bathed it in intense X-ray 
radiation, the planet HD 189733b's atmosphere gave off a powerful burst of 
evaporation.

Hubble found that the planet's upper atmosphere was streaming away at speeds exceeding 300,000 mph. Just before the Hubble observation, NASA's Swift detected the star blasting out a strong X-ray flare, one powerful enough to blow away part of the planet's atmosphere

Astronomer
 Alain Lecavelier des Etangs and his team used Hubble to observe the 
atmosphere of exoplanet HD 189733b during two periods in early 2010 and 
late 2011, as it was silhouetted against its parent star.

While
 backlit in this way, the planet's atmosphere imprints its chemical 
signature on the starlight, allowing astronomers to decode what is 
happening on scales that are too tiny to image directly.

The observations were carried 
out in order to confirm what the team had previously seen once before in
 a different planetary system: the evaporation of an exoplanet's 
atmosphere.

HD 189733b has a blue sky, but that's where the similarities with Earth stop.

The
 planet is a huge gas giant similar to Jupiter, but it lies extremely 
close to its star, just one thirtieth the distance Earth is from the 
Sun.

Even 
though its star is slightly smaller and cooler than the Sun, this makes 
the planet's climate exceptionally hot, at above 1000 degrees Celsius, 
and the upper atmosphere is battered by energetic extreme-ultraviolet 
and X-ray radiation.

As such, it is an excellent candidate to study the effects of a star on a planetary atmosphere.

'The
 first set of observations were actually disappointing,' Lecavelier 
said, 'since they showed no trace of the planet's atmosphere at all. We 
only realised we had chanced upon something more interesting when the 
second set of observations came in.'

The
 team's follow-up observations, made in 2011, showed a dramatic change, 
with clear signs of a plume of gas being blown from the planet at a rate
 of at least 1000 tonnes per second.

Lecavelier
 added: 'We hadn't just confirmed that some planets' atmospheres 
evaporate - we had watched the physical conditions in the evaporating 
atmosphere vary over time. Nobody had done that before.'

Despite the extreme temperature of the planet, the atmosphere is not hot enough to evaporate at the rate seen in 2011.

Instead
 the evaporation is thought to be driven by the intense X-ray and 
extreme-ultraviolet radiation from the parent star, HD 189733A, which is
 about 20 times more powerful than that of our own Sun.

Taking
 into account also that HD 189733b is a giant planet very close to its 
star, then it must suffer an X-ray dose three million times higher than 
the Earth.

Evidence to 
support X-ray driven evaporation comes from simultaneous observations of
 HD 189733A with the Swift satellite, which, unlike Hubble, can observe 
the star's atmosphere-frying X-rays.

A
 few hours before Hubble observed the planet for the second time, Swift 
recorded a powerful flash of radiation coming from the surface of the 
star, in which the star briefly became 4 times brighter in X-rays.

Co-author
 Peter Wheatley, from the University of Warwick, said: 'X-ray emissions 
are a small part of the star's total output, but it is the part that it 
is energetic enough to drive the evaporation of the atmosphere.

'This
 was the brightest X-ray flare from HD 189733A of several observed to 
date, and it seems very likely that the impact of this flare on the 
planet drove the evaporation seen a few hours later with Hubble.'

X-rays
 are energetic enough to heat the gas in the upper atmosphere to tens of
 thousands of degrees, hot enough to escape the gravitational pull of 
the giant planet.

A similar 
process occurs, albeit less dramatically, when a space weather event 
such as a solar flare hits the Earth's ionosphere, disrupting 
communications.

While the 
team believes that the flash of X-rays is the most likely cause of the 
atmospheric changes they saw on HD 189733b, there are other possible 
explanations.

For example, 
it may be that the baseline level of X-ray emission from the star 
increased between 2010 and 2011, in a seasonal process similar to the 
Sun's 11-year sunspot cycle.

Regardless
 of the details of exactly what happened to HD 189733b's atmosphere, 
which the team hope to clarify using future observations with Hubble and
 ESA's XMM-Newton X-ray space telescope, there is no question that the 
planet was hit by a stellar flare, and no question that the rate of 
evaporation of the planet's atmosphere shot up.

This
 research has relevance not only for the study of Jupiter-like planets. 
Several recent discoveries of rocky 'super Earths' near their parent 
stars are thought to be the remnants of planets like HD 189733b, after 
the complete evaporation of their atmospheres.
