A Hawaii woman who filmed herself having sex with an 11-year-old boy has been sentenced to 20 years in prison.

Jean Paleracio pleaded no contest to first-degree sexual assault charges.

The 33-year-old was described as a 'sexual predator,' with the judge, Kathleen Wantanabe, telling her, 'there is no other way to put it, Miss Paleracio, other than you took ultimate advantage of a young boy.'

Guilty: Jean Paleracio was sentenced to 20 years in prison for repeatedly having sex with a teenage boy

Paleracio, from Kapa, Hawaii, videotaped herself having sex with the boy on several occasionsÂ  between May 2009 and September 2013.

A former worker with the Kauai Economic Opportunity Early Learning Centre, Paleracio was friends with the victim through his family.

Prosecutors at the hearing in Lihue said the young boy would be scarred for life following the abuse.

Paleracio was accused of producing or participating in preparation of child pornography materials with a minor, and engaging in or assisting others to engage in sexual conduct.

She pleaded no contest to first-degree sexual assault and first-degree promotion of child abuse.

Prosecutor Lisa Arin said Paleracio had cooperated with the investigation and showed true remorse.

As a result, Arin said her office did not seek consecutive 20-year sentences.

Prosecuting attorney Justin Kollar said he was satisfied with the no contest plea, as it means the victim would not be exposed to the trauma of a trial.

'Ms. Paleracio's actions were sickening and predatory and cannot be tolerated in our community,' Kollar said.

As a result of the plea deal, eight other class A felony charges were dismissed.

A pre-sentence investigation of Paleracio showed she had completed two years of college and has no prior convictions.

The judge said Paleracio was someone who used to work with children and should appreciate, more than most, the fact that forcing a child to perform sexual acts can have long-term traumatic effects.
