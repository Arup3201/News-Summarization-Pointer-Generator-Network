If all those pictures of a bouncing baby Windsor are making you yearn for a more palatial abode to bring up your own royal family, then look no further.

Lethbridge House, dubbed the Palace in the Park, is finally on the market.

And it'll cost you a king's ransom - of £40 million.

Des res: Lethbridge House at no. 20 Cornwall Terrace is one of the properties going for 170 times the average price of a new home

That's 170 times the average new house 
price, making Lethbridge House and the other properties in the Cornwall 
Terrace development opposite Regent's Park some of the most expensive in
the world.

Lethbridge House is the only home in the terrace to feature a carriage driveway, swimming pool and spa and ballroom.

There are two separate mews houses at the back so you can put your guests up in true royal style.

Luxury: Among other features, Lethbridge House boasts a private spa with a sauna and swimming pool so owners can relax in splendour in their own home

It is spread over 11,767sq ft, with rooms including spacious living areas, a wine cellar and a media room.

The mansion also boasts six bedrooms and seven bathrooms.

It is the last property to go on the market from the terrace, which is made up of eight Grade I listed homes originally built in 1811.

Because of the huge work undertaken on the development, the terrace properties are classified as new homes.

Builders spent around 83,000 
man-hours creating each home and it took one whole year to hand-dig 
two metres beneath the original basement to create two extra floors.

Plush: The reception and ballroom are kitted out with features including sparkling chandeliers which make this the ultimate high society home in the centre of the capital

The asking price is 250 times that of the average £162,000 home sold in England and Wales.

However,
while the buyer will face a large payout and a potential £6 million in 
stamp duty, they will pay just £1,361.48 in council tax.

Cornwall Terrace was designed by 
Royal architect Sir John Nash as part of the Prince Regent's - later 
King George IV - plans for the 19th century masterpiece Regent's Park.

Overlooking
the park's rowing lake, the double-fronted mansions belonged to the 
British nobility for 150 years before being occupied by commercial 
concerns.

Developers Oakmayne bought the terrace around five years ago and employed a group of renowned interior designers, supervised by English Heritage and The Crown Estate, to give the properties a makeover.

Lethbridge House was named after Sir Roper Lethbridge who was an academic, a civil servant in India and an important Conservative politician representing Kensington North constituency.

Palatial: Lethbridge House is part of the 19th-century Cornwall Terrace development, which overlooks Regent's Park in London

Nicola Fontanella of Argent Design, who redesigned Lethbridge House, said: 'From the swimming pool, spa and gym complex located on the lower ground floor, right the way to the very top, both the owners and their special guests will experience a sensory explosion, as not only have touch, sight and sound been considered but even taste and smell as Oakmayne Bespoke bring a totally new dimension to contemporary living in a Regency home.'

Lethbridge House, which can be seen at www.cornwallterrace.co.uk, is being marketed through Beauchamp Estates, Knight Frank and Savills estate agents.
