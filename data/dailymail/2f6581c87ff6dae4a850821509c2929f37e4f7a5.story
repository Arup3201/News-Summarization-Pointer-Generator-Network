Four bears have been found dead in New Hampshire after overdosing on chocolate, authorities say.

The state's Fish and Game Department is now considering banning hunters from using the confection as bait.

A post-mortem confirmed the bruins - two a female adults and two cubs - died of heart failure caused by theobromine poisoning. 

Theobromine is an alkaloid found in chocolate that can prove toxic to some animals. There are higher levels of the ingredient in dark and baker’s chocolate compared to milk.

Wildlife biologists are unsure exactly how much chocolate is fatal for bears, but some predict that is similar to toxicity levels for wolves.

The Department of Natural Resources and Environment in Michigan previously estimated that it would take 9lbs of milk, 2.5lbs of semi-sweet, or 1.25lbs of baker’s chocolate to kill a 20lb wolf.

In the New Hampshire case, the bears were found dead within 50 feet of where a hunter had put down 90lbs of chocolate and doughnuts as bait last September. 

Andrew Timmins, the state Fish and Game Department's bear project leader, told a commission meeting Wednesday that the best way to stop this from happening again is to remove chocolate from the woods,

The possibility that bears could die from eating chocolate caught the department's attention in 2011, after the death of a black bear cub in Michigan was linked to theobromine.

Timmins said the amount of theobromine varies by type of chocolate used, but all can be toxic depending on how much an animal eats.

'We view bear baiting as an important management tool,' he told The Concord Monitor.

'It's not something we want to go get rid of, but perhaps some modifications need to be made to determine bear baiting practices to eliminate the chances of chocolate poisoning our wildlife.'

Dave Nickerson, who attended the meeting, was skeptical of the cause of the death. 

He said chocolate has been used at many sites, and has been used in many states. 

He asked if the lab had tested for antifreeze.

'This is the first time we've had four dead bears at one site,' Nickerson said. 

'It highly suggests that poisoning could have occurred.'

The deaths from chocolate appear to have been unintentional. 

The male hunter, who was not identified, told officials he has trapped for 15 years and used the same chocolate at other sites this past season.
