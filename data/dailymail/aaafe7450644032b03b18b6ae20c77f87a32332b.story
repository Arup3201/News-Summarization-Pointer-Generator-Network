Tim Howard will return in goal for Everton at Chelsea on Wednesday night – but Leighton Baines is set to miss the game with a knee injury.

United States international Howard is fit again after recovering from a calf injury sustained against Stoke on Boxing Day.

He was close to being fit for last Saturday's Merseyside derby, although manager Roberto Martinez decided not to risk him.

Instead, the 35-year-old will go straight back in against the Premier League leaders, with Joel Robles dropping out – even though the Spaniard has kept clean sheets in each of Everton's last two matches.

Martinez said: 'Tim has been working really well. Yesterday, he trained well. He's fully fit now for any sort of games.

'Whenever Tim is fit, he's our number one, for the experience that he has and what he represents to the squad. I've got total faith in him.

'Goalkeeper is not like any other position. I do feel that the outfield positions are more about moments of form, ways of playing against the opposition and different ways of approaching games. In goal you need stability.

'Joel has been really good. I've been so pleased with his last two performances.'

Left-back Baines, 30, sat out Saturday's 0-0 draw against Liverpool after failing a late fitness test, and Martinez has indicated that he is unlikely to be risked.

He said: 'Leighton Baines had a fitness test on the day of the Liverpool game. Today is exactly the same. He hasn't been able to train since then, so it's difficult at the moment to see him being involved.

'We'll see how he is today, we'll assess him again, and we'll make a final decision closer to the game.'

Winger Aiden McGeady is out of the Chelsea match with a bruised knee suffered in training – but Martinez is relieved that the injury was not far worse.

He said: 'At that time, we were very worried, because his knee had a really bad challenge. We had the scans and did the tests - and nothing is damaged in terms of structure.

'The ligaments and the meniscus are intact. But the bone had a really strong bruise, and that will take a little time to clear, so he's not training at the moment. It will take a few days.

'It's hard to tell how long it's going to take for the bone to be ready, but it's not a big problem. When we first saw the incident, it was a bit of a worry.'

Martinez, meanwhile, insists that right-back Seamus Coleman's future is at Everton, despite suggestions that he should move on.

Former Manchester United and Republic of Ireland defender Denis Irwin has said that Coleman needs to join a bigger European club to further his career.

But Martinez said: 'I still think that Seamus Coleman can develop and progress with Everton.

'He's become important in the team that we want to grow in order to achieve big things as well. Sometimes that's better than going to a club in Europe where you're not guaranteed to play.

'This is the best place for him to develop his potential. He's a world-class footballer, which he showed from the way he performed last season.'
