A woman who was held up at knife-point in her car and told to 'smile' in a terrifying carjacking has bravely appealed for witnesses to the crime to come forward.

Merlyn Bokhar, in her 30s, was at a Rockdale City Council car park when a man jumped into her car and forced her to drive about a kilometre away to nearby Kent Street in the south-west Sydney suburb.

At the time of Monday's attack about 12.30pm, Ms Bokhar was on her way to bank about $32,000 worth of business takings. 

Merlyn Bokhar was attacked in broad daylight at a car park in Greeves Avenue in Rockdale - in Sydney's south-west

The alleged thief took the money and threatened to kill her if she went to police about the incident, 9News reported.

He got into a blue Toyota sedan which was parked in Kent Street driven by another man. 

Ms Bokhar made the emotional plea through tears for people to help catch her attack.

'Everybody saw him, what happened...just call the cop and help me please because anytime [he] can kill me,' she said. 

Ms Bokhar told police the man had held a knife against her and threatened to kill her on Monday afternoon

The alleged attacker made her drive to nearby Kent Street where a getaway car was waiting for him, driven by another man

NSW police found Ms Bokhar suffering from shock at Kent Street and told them she had been confronted at a car park on Geeves Avenue at Rockdale.

Officers from St George Local Area Command have launched an investigation into the incident.

The alleged attack is described as being of African appearance, about 180cm tall and aged in his 20s with medium build. He was wearing a green top.
