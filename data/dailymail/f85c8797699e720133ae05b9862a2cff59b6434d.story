Olympic champion swimmer Rebecca Adlington understands the undesirable side of fame, having been subjected to endless abuse about the way she looks

If anyone understands the undesirable side of fame, it is swimmer Rebecca Adlington. She might be a four-time Olympic medallist but, for as long as she has been feted for her sporting achievements, she has also been subject to endless abuse over the way she looks.

One comedian compared the swimmer to a dolphin, while Twitter trolls attacked her about her weight, her nose and for simply not being pretty enough. For a girl who has admitted to hating her appearance it must have been devastating.

Worse, when it became apparent earlier this year that Rebecca had undergone surgery to have her nose reduced and bump removed, it became a national talking point as to whether she should or shouldn’t have given in to the cyber bullies.

Little wonder she’s so far refused to confirm or deny the reports she did indeed undergo surgery.  

Sitting opposite her, there’s no doubt that Rebecca, 25, looks different: leaner, more polished and, yes, with a more streamlined nose. And it’s not just outwardly she has changed. Adlington, who retired from competitive swimming after the London Olympics, has also developed a greater inner confidence.

Speaking for the first time about ‘the nose job’, Rebecca is emphatic in insisting that it is nobody’s business but her own. ‘If somebody else wants to know [that], well tough luck,’ she says with a toss of her long blonde hair.

‘It’s my life. Loads of women have loads of things that they do – like a Kim Kardashian or whatever – but  I just think if you open yourself  up in that way, there’s a lot more that happens.

‘I’ve never opened the door in that way. I never set out to be in the  spotlight. I’ve fallen into it by  doing something that I love, that is my passion.’

Having this attitude meant that when the online attacks began, it was all the harder to bear. The youngest of Mansfield businessman Steve Adlington and his wife Kay’s three daughters, Rebecca had no idea of the shocking vitriol that would be levelled at her after she won two gold medals at the Beijing Olympics in 2008.

Rebecca explains: ‘Obviously, being a swimmer, you never think you’re going to get any sort of profile, so I didn’t know what fame was. I didn’t expect it.

'The thing that I found very difficult when it all started happening after Beijing was that people were commenting on something that I just didn’t understand – on the way I look – and I thought, “What’s that got to do with swimming?” So that hit me.

‘I also thought, well I’m trying to represent my country and you should be wanting to help everyone – all the British team get behind each other.

'At first it definitely upset me. I’d burst into tears when I first started reading things but as I’ve grown up I’ve learnt to think, you know what, I don’t know them, they’ve never seen me in real life, they’ve never spoken to me. 

'At first it definitely upset me. I'd burst into tears when I first started reading things but as I've grown up I've learnt to think, you know what, I don't know them, they've never seen me in real life'

‘You’ve got to be a certain kind of person to sit there, make the effort to find somebody, to write them a nasty message . . . You know what? Just block them out of your mind.’

In reality, it’s not as simple as all that. The path of a young and newly retired athlete is not always easy but Rebecca is now carving out a successful TV career.

During her appearance on I’m A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here, she regularly broke down in tears after comparing herself unfavourably to fellow contestant Amy Willerton, a beauty queen of not inconsiderable assets.

But Rebecca is now on the panel of ITV’s chatshow Loose Women – where she is sparky and forthright – and will also soon appear on Through The Keyhole.

She and her fiance, Harry Needs, a professional swimmer three years her junior (he used to have her poster on his wall), are getting married in August.

They have a comfortable home in Stockport, Greater Manchester, and want to have children one day. Life is good yet Rebecca admits that on occasions she can’t resist looking at Twitter.

‘I sit there at eight o’clock at night and Harry’s saying, “Bec, why are you checking Twitter? You’re allowing them into our home.”

‘I’d never thought of it that way.  You’re sat there in your home, which is your comfort zone, and yet you’re reading comments from other people and allowing them in. I thought yes, you’re right. Why am I doing this? I’ve tried to stop it now... although I do it if Harry’s out.’

The nastiness has died down but, according to Rebecca, that doesn’t necessarily mean the Twittersphere has changed.

‘It’s only because I’ve blocked them all [the trolls],’ she says with a hearty laugh. ‘I must have blocked about 4,000 people. I actually Googled it the other day to see if there’s any way I can find out how many people I’ve done it to.

‘Maybe it’s not 4,000, but I must have blocked at least 2,000 people.  In a day I’ve blocked 100, 200 people, if something’s happened. But to be fair it’s calmed down a lot.’

'I'm definitely happier with how I look now... But I wouldn't necessarily say happy. I think you still always see the same thing when you look in the mirror'

Still, she’s obviously taken the bullying to heart. Rebecca recently launched a campaign, run by Legal & General, to find out what advice the nation would give to their younger selves to make their lives better.

She says she would tell her teenage self not to let strangers affect the way she feels about herself.

In the flesh, the swimmer looks much prettier ... and it’s not just because of the smoother nose. Yet she still struggles with her insecurities. ‘I’m definitely happier with how I look now,’ she says.

‘But I wouldn’t necessarily say happy. I think you still always see the same thing when you look in the mirror. A lot of people tell me that you get more comfortable with yourself with age and obviously I’ve still got a lot of growing up to do.

‘But I will never have this figure that’s big-boobed and tiny waist and curvaceous bum. I know I have got slightly bigger shoulders than some people and an average cup size, that’s not going to change.’

When she was swimming Rebecca needed to consume up to 3,500 calories a day. She would eat six Weetabix for breakfast, four sandwiches for lunch, a huge spaghetti bolognese in the evenings as well as constantly snacking. When she stopped swimming, perhaps inevitably, the weight piled on.  

Rebecca added: 'You do get down but now I¿ve learnt only to listen to the people I know, whose opinion I value'

The former athlete lost most of the weight when she was on I’m A Celebrity and hasn’t put anything back on since.

She reveals the only diet she does is the Jason Vale five- day juice diet, which seems pretty extreme, but she insists she has a healthy attitude to food.

‘I’m sensible. I have a glass of wine with a meal now I’ve retired although I’ve only just started getting into it. I like white wine but I can’t get into red. I’m not there yet. It tastes like vinegar. My mum keeps saying to me, “Trust me, it will come.”'

At the London Olympics, Rebecca won two bronze medals, making her Britain’s most decorated female Olympian alongside the rower Katherine Grainger, but she admits she grew to dread race days.  

Rebecca says: ‘I hated waking up and feeling so sick with nerves, it was unbelievable.

'And that whole four-hour period or whatever it was leading up to a race where you literally can’t eat anything and your emotions are going crazy because you’re so nervous.

‘In most other sports you have your season with lots of big competitions. Like footballers who have a match every weekend.

'We only competed twice a year. It was very difficult going into a race that you’ve trained 90 per cent of the year for that lasted four minutes. All of that for a four-minute race.

'That’s what I found difficult. Afterwards, you feel so frazzled, it’s like someone’s just electrocuted your brain.’

By comparison she loves her new career on TV, and loves appearing on Loose Women. ‘I really enjoy it. And I’m pretty all right at holding my own,’ she says.

‘For a long time it [the Twitter abuse] was something I found difficult to deal with.

‘You do get down but now I’ve learnt only to listen to the people I know, whose opinion I value.’
