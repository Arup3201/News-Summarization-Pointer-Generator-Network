New pictures showing the inside of Charlie Hebdo's offices moments after terrorist gunmen stormed in and murdered the magazine's senior staff have emerged today.

One desk is covered with the day's work - papers, water bottles, and a coffee mug - while underneath the swivel chair a large pool of blood has settled on the laminate wood flooring.

A bag, packed full of what appears to be artist's drawings, sits next to it on the floor while notes are tacked to the surrounding walls.  

Tragic: A desk is still covered with the day's work, along with empty water bottles and a coffee mug, inside the offices of Charlie Hebdo - while underneath the chair there is a pool of blood

Investigators: This is the moment police first moved into the building in the Le Marais district of Paris after brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi killed the senior staff on Wednesday last week

Bloodied footprints are visible leading away from the chair and in to the next room, as a pair of blue latex forensic gloves lie abandoned on the floor. 

Another image shows the moment forensic investigators moved into the building following the massacre which happened at around 10.30am on Wednesday morning.

The magazine, and  its editor Stephane Charbonnier, known as Charb, was targeted for repeatedly printing cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed.

He was killed in the attack, along with some of France's most experienced and revered cartoonists, along with journalists and columnists, including Bernard 'Tignous' Verlhac, Georges Wolinski, Jean 'Cabu' Cabut, Philippe Honore, Bernard Maris, Elsa Cayat, Mustapha Ourrad and Michel Renaud.

Brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi, 34 and 32, were responsible for the bloody assault, and died three days later after being cornered in a print works to the north of Paris by armed officers. 

The first picture to show the inside the offices of the satirical magazine, likened by many to Private Eye, emerged over the weekend.

That images shows a corridor covered with yet more bloody footprints and crumpled papers stuck to the floor boards after those who had been working on them just hours before were killed.

Like countless other offices, notes and cards adorn a corridor wall. But here, police tape has also been attached to a door.

Six of the Charlie Hebdo staff killed in Wednesday's attack are pictured together in this photo, taken in 2000. Circled top from left is Philippe Honore, Georges Wolinski, Bernard Maris and Jean Cabut. Below them on the stairs, from left, is editor Stephane Charbonnier and cartoonist Bernard ‘Tignous’ Verlhac

One of the cartoons on the wall appears to be the sketch for the controversial ‘Sharia Hebdo’ front page, which sparked the previous terrorist attack in November 2011.

The firebomb – which destroyed the magazine’s computer system but failed to injure anyone – came after the publication ran an issue supposedly guest-edited by Mohammed, containing cartoons of the Muslim prophet and the slogan: ‘100 lashes if you don’t die of laughter’.

The tragic scenes from inside No 10, Rue Nicolas-Appert, in the Le Marais district of Paris, appeared as France began mobilising 10,000 security personnel to protect 'sensitive sites' around the country.

The move was announced by Jean-Yves Le Drian, the Minister for Defence, after a security briefing early this morning.

Interior Minister Bernard Cazaneuve also said that 5,000 officers would be sent to protect the country's Jewish schools, with troops deployed over the next two days as backup.

The French Prime Minister Manuel Valls insisted the extra security was necessary because 'the threat is still present' after last week's attacks.

Mr Valls told BFM television today that France is at war against 'terrorism, against jihadism, against radical Islam'.

The news came as David Cameron was also briefed on the threat posed to Britain by security chiefs in Downing Street this morning.

A No 10 spokesman said it had been agreed that future counter-terror training exercises will include scenarios similar to the Paris attack.

French police also announced that they are hunting for another accomplice who they suspect helped deli attacker Amedy Coulibaly, 32, create his suicide video, before edited it and posting it online after the attacks had taken place.

Coulibaly's girlfriend, Hayat Boumedienne, is also being hunted by police after it was revealed she crossed Europe and escaped into Syria in the days before her partner shot a policewoman dead, then killed four more in a Jewish supermarket.
