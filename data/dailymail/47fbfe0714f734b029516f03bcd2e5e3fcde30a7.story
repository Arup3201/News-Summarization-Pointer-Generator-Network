Many car enthusiasts dream of owning an Aston Martin, not many go to the trouble of building one.

Ivan Sentch, 32, from Auckland, New Zealand, is printing hundreds of plastic parts that fit together to form a 1961 Series II Aston Martin DB4.

It is an earlier, but very similar model to the one made famous by James Bond.

Labour of love: Computer programmer Ivan Sentch is using 3D technology to print a full-sized Aston Martin

Attention to detail: The distinctive shape of the 1961 Series II Aston Martin DB4 frame is 72 per cent finished so far after work began in December 2012

Precise work: Much of the body's core structure is already completed, after carefully assembling 2,500 plastic parts

Each piece is 'printed', then mounted onto a wood frame and glued into
place.

With 2,500 sections printed, he is currently 72 per cent of the 
way finished.

Sentch estimates it will take another five years until he can actually take 
the car on the road.

His blog, Replica DB4 Project, has chronicled the ambitious 
project since he started it in his garage and it now has 
an international following.

It would be virtually impossible for the married father-of-two to buy an original DB4.

Taking shape: Sentch plans to use the body he is currently printing to create a mould, which will then be used for the body of the DB4 replica

Plastic print-out: Sentch has no previous experience with 3D printing but the results so far have been very impressive

Painstaking: Sentch has been mounting the individual pieces onto the wooden frame and then gluing each piece into place

Humble beginnings: Sentch started from scratch, without even knowing how to use the 3D printing software

There are only 1,200 DB4 models in existence, and they often fetch around £220,000 at auction.

They were only manufactured between September 1961 and October 1962, making them a very rare commodity.

The outline he is creating now will be used to make a fibreglass mould which will be used to form a custom-built frame which will be the actual car.

Sentch has no previous experience with 3D printing but he has learned how to use the software as he goes along.

Progress: Sentch only started in December but reckons it will be roadworthy in the next five years

The goal: An Aston Martin DB4, which are rarely available to buy even at auction

Once the plastic print-out is finished and painted, he thinks it will be as close to an original sleek, stylish classic sports car as you could get.

'It will be seriously cool. I want to use it for my everyday car,' Sentch said.

He estimates his plastic cost about £1,300 so far - not bad for a dream car.
