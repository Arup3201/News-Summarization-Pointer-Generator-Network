David Helens, 25, was arrested after making a false 999 call where he claimed a 'friend' had been shot

A man frantically called 999 to report a shooting and said his friend had stopped breathing but he was actually playing the computer game Grand Theft Auto, a court heard.

David Helens, 25, from South Shields, Tyne and Wear, had been playing a long session of the violent video game when he rung emergency services saying his friend 'Max' was bleeding badly.

He told a call handler that the man had suffered a gunshot wound to the chest and was 'slipping in and out of consciousness' before telling her he thought he was dead.

The defendant then began screaming and shouting and said he had been attacked by a third person.

Two ambulances were quickly dispatched to the house where they discovered the call was a complete fantasy and the events had in fact taken place in the video game.

Helens was arrested when he told police he had been playing the  guns and gangsters game shortly before making the call.

Christopher Rose, prosecuting, said: 'The call lasted for approximately 12 minutes.

'The caller said he was at an address and that he was with another man called Max who had suffered a gunshot injury to his chest.

'He said the man was slipping in an out of consciousness and bleeding badly.

'An ambulance had to be dispatched and, once the call handler was told the man had stopped breathing, and that he might be dead, this information had to be treated as a possible cardiac arrest and a second ambulance was called.'

He added: 'The defendant then said he himself had been attacked by a third person and feigned screaming and shouting.

'The call taker said that this caused her to be very concerned for his safety and that of 'Max'.'

Helens admitted making the malicious 999 call on November 8, and was sentenced to a 12 month community order when he appeared at South Tyneside Magistrates' Court. 

The court heard a police interview in which Helens admitted making the call, and said that none of things he claimed while speaking to the call handler had actually happened.

Helens had spent a long session on notorious and violent video game Grand Theft Auto before making call

He said he knew of the inconvenience he had caused to the ambulance and police services.

The call taker, from North East Ambulance Service (NEAS), told the court in a victim impact statement that she had been left 'shaken' by the incident.

The best-selling game has caused controversy over its adult content and violence

She said: 'This man's behaviour on the telephone made me feel concerned. The whole incident has left me feeling a bit shaken.'

Laura Johnson, defending, told the court: 'It would appear that the phone call made to the emergency services coincided with him playing a violent shooting game on his computer.

'He tells me that he has very little recollection of the phone call.

'Mr Helens has significant health needs. He is deaf in his left ear, partially blind in his left eye and has speech problems.

'He accepts that he caused disruption and upset to the call taker and he apologises for his actions.'

A spokesman for NEAS said: 'We welcome the result of this court case.

'This inappropriate call lasted 12 minutes and resulted in the dispatch of two ambulances, resources which will have been needed elsewhere for genuine emergencies.

'I hope it sends out a clear message to others who might consider misusing our services or abusing or assaulting our staff.'

Helens was told to complete 120 hours of unpaid work and will be subject to a supervision requirement for 18 months. He must also pay £85 in costs and a £60 victim surcharge.
