When she was the most famous hooker in showbusiness - thanks to career-defining roles in the 1986 film Mona Lisa and Kay Mellor's 90s TV hit Band Of Gold - Cathy Tyson had a reputation for being a bit chippy.

She'd arrive late for interviews, answer questions dismissively and even turned Hollywood down after being told to lose weight.

She's just returned to the acting world after a four-year break in which she went to university to study literature and drama, and how she's changed.

Cathy's now 48 and still has the perfectly sculpted cheekbones and feline eyes that made her one of Britain's most recognisable stars. Only now her corkscrew Afro hair is tinged with grey and, I'm relieved to see, she has a big smile on her face.

She hooks her arm into mine as we search for somewhere to eat in the rundown south London suburb where she's rehearsing for her latest play.

She's just thrown herself headlong into work; after finishing critically acclaimed play Snakes And Ladders she's about to start new show Stand - a play about people standing up for what they believe in - in Oxford.

But there's a sad tinge when we meet, with the death from pneumonia of Bob Hoskins, with whom she co-starred in Mona Lisa. 'He was the most genial of men,' she recalls.

'Everyone loved working with him, and nobody had a bad word to say about him. He always gave advice freely and willingly, and with his help I became a better actress.

'Mona Lisa was my first film and I was extremely nervous. Bob made me instantly feel at ease. He invited me around to dinner before we started shooting the movie and from the beginning he was a lovely, encouraging man. He always had a big wide smile on his face and you could talk to him about anything. He was the first male actor I saw cry and that encouraged me to show my own emotions more while acting. I learnt so much from him; not only when it came to acting and how to be in front of cameras but even how to talk to the press.

'We stayed in contact for a long time and I still have the postcard he sent me from Los Angeles when Mona Lisa first came out there. It was a huge billboard of us from the film and he wrote, "Look at us!" I last saw him about three or four years ago when he'd moved back to north London.

'We bumped into each other in the street and it was so nice to see him. He instantly invited me to a party at his house which I couldn't go to because of work. I'm still so sad and shocked that he died so young - to me 71 is young. I was sad I hadn't seen more of him over the past few years but I know he had a happy life. He was surrounded by family and people who loved him and he had a great body of work. He was someone who made Britain proud.'

Cathy put her career - which had most recently included successful productions with the RSC and a spell in Emmerdale - on hold after growing 'jaded' with life.

'I'd lost my appetite for work,' she says. 'I didn't like the parts I was reading for. I've always wanted to study but as an actor you're always worried about missing that one big job. Finally I just thought, "I'm going to risk it."'

'I 
wanted to be white. There was this fantasy that if I was white I'd have 
no problems.'

So she rented out her house and took a student loan, moved into digs at Brunel University and buried her head in her books.

'I'm delighted I did it because it's changed everything,' she beams. 'It's given me a confidence I never had before. I was so miserable in my own life. I didn't live outside of work. I didn't have a social life, or the social skills to meet people. It's shown me new things aren't just for the young. The only problem was, when I finished university I worried I was too content to act. I always did my best work when I was miserable. But I suppose there's always something to worry about,' she laughs.

Cathy's always been a worrier. The only child of a Trinidadian barrister father who was largely absent during her childhood and a British social worker mother, she never had much time for school apart from drama lessons. She'd regularly play truant and when she was 13 ran away from home, finding a job as a chambermaid in London for a week before she was tracked down by the police and sent home.

'I was a 
bit of a rebel and I found Liverpool totally uninspiring,' she says. 'I 
knew I didn't want to stay there. We lived in a block of flats which was
 mainly filled with single mothers. Many of them were nice but there 
were lots of things that made me frightened to walk out the door. The 
whole area was racist and there was a lot of joyriding and mugging.'

Being
 told 'go back to where you come from' was normal and she still recalls 
being told that if she rubbed her skin enough it would turn white. 'I 
wanted to be white. There was this fantasy that if I was white I'd have 
no problems.'

Cathy's most famous role was a prostitute in Band Of Gold, however she said this was the most miserable period of her life

For Cathy acting was a release, a way of coping with her emotions, and a way out of Liverpool. After a spell at Liverpool's Everyman Theatre - where the likes of Julie Walters, Pete Postlethwaite and Jonathan Pryce began their careers - she joined the RSC. By then she'd already met and married Red Dwarf actor Craig Charles (now mini-cab driver Lloyd in Coronation Street) after she saw him perform in Liverpool.

'He was one of the first men I really had a conversation with; he could speak,' she says. Within a month of being together she proposed. 'I was a feminist and he said yes. It was crazy, I didn't even know who I was, let alone who he was.'

They married in 1984 when she was 19 and he was 20. Two years later she was thrust into the limelight with the success of Mona Lisa, in which she played a high-class prostitute with Bob Hoskins as her ex-con driver. Hollywood came calling but she was terrified when hints were dropped by agents that she needed to lose weight.

'I was frightened when people told me to 
lose weight. I thought, "I want people to 
judge what's coming out of my mouth rather than what I look like. I've 
got a brain."'

'I turned down several auditions which was silly but I was frightened when people told me to lose weight because I was already skinny. I thought, "I want people to judge what's coming out of my mouth rather than what I look like. I've got a brain."'

Her career was temporarily stalled by the birth of her son Jack in 1988. But by then her marriage was crumbling and they divorced when Jack was still a baby. Cathy's reluctant to talk about Craig's well-publicised drug problems but says the pair finally have 'a respectful relationship' because of their musician son.

She's never married again; nor had a serious relationship. 'I suppose I need to be stimulated to stay with the same person.'

In 1995 she took on her other most famous role; as another prostitute in Band Of Gold. Despite its success she says it was one of the most miserable periods of her life. 'I was still finding my feet and angry,' she says. 'My marriage had disintegrated and I felt shame. I don't think I was clinically depressed but I was very troubled.'

Many older actresses insist they're happier to have left their nubile 20s behind, but I've never believed any of them as much as I believe Cathy. 'I'm so grateful to be older and be in the space I am now,' she says. 'If only I knew back then what I know now.'

Cathy will be appearing in Stand at the Oxford Playhouse, from 29 May. Visit www.oxfordplayhouse.com.
