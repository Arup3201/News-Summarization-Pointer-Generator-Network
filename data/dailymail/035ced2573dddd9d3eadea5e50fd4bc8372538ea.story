Popular: There has been rising demand for juniper as the gin industry in Scotland enjoys a resurgence

At least it would mean fewer mothers facing ruin - but it could spell disaster for the makers of tonic.

The Scottish-grown berries which give gin its distinct flavour are at risk of being wiped out, it was revealed yesterday.

The spirit, sometimes known as mother’s ruin, has been infused with juniper berries for centuries, giving it an instantly recognisable crisp taste and smell.

But a deadly invasive fungus is putting Scottish junipers ‘in serious trouble’ as nature experts plead with the public to help save the berry.

Stock is already suffering from old age, with many specimens more than 100 years old, while booming rabbit and vole populations are taking their toll.

There has been rising demand for juniper as the gin industry in Scotland enjoys a resurgence.

But 45 per cent of Scottish trees are at risk of being wiped out, research for Forestry Commission Scotland found.

A new study is now being conducted by Plantlife Scotland, in conjunction with the commission and Scottish Natural Heritage, to ensure it is preserved for the future in Scotland.

A spokesman for Plantlife Scotland said: ‘Juniper is in serious trouble. One of only three native conifers in Britain, not only does it face a new deadly fungal disease, Phytophthora austrocedrae, it has also disappeared from over one-third of Britain.’

The organisation is calling on the public to contribute to its research project and help determine the loss of the berry.

Troubled: A deadly invasive fungus is putting Scottish junipers 'in serious trouble' as nature experts plead with the public to help save the berry.

Deborah Long, from Plantlife Scotland, yesterday said: ‘Juniper, with its blueish green needles and green or black berries, is easy to identify. We are asking people to complete a survey form every time they see juniper in Scotland.

‘However, if you notice any orange or brown bushes, there may be a risk of infection by  Phytophthora austrocedrae.

‘If this happens people should document this but ensure they do not walk around the area. They should also clean mud thoroughly from their boots and their equipment.’

Carl Reavey, of Bruichladdich distillery on Islay, which produces The Botanist gin, said: ‘There is very, very little juniper left on Islay and the vast majority of what we use comes from Italy.’

A spokesman for Hendricks Gin, which is distilled in Girvan, Ayrshire, said its juniper came largely from Macedonia.
