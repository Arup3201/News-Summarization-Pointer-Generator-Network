Even in the world's war-torn nations, there are moments of joy, and in the case of these Afghani children, it's the Kabul amusement park.

City Park, an oasis of colour in the otherwise grey concrete of Kabul, has attracted tens of thousands of visitors since opening last month.

For families in Kabul, who have suffered war for the past three decades, Afghanistan's first amusement park offers a rare escape from their everyday lives blighted by conflict, death and misery.

As families walk through the gates of the amusement park, they are met by their favourite cartoon heroes, Minnie Mouse and Tom the Cat from Tom and Jerry.

Minnie might not look as authentic as the one walking the boulevards of Disney World Paris, but the children of Kabul do not care, or know the difference. 

The excited children scuttle round the actors' feet, as they hug and dance with children, before they run off to go on a ride or have their face painted.

City Park, located at the foot of the snow-capped Hindu Kush mountains, next to the filthy Kabul River and near a zoo famous only for its abused, one-eyed lion.

It has all the traditional fairground rides, including carousels, a Ferris wheel and bumper cars, although the paint is chipped in places.

It is is one of few places where residents of the Afghan capital can take their children for a relaxing day out.  

'It's very nice, everything is very beautiful, the carousel horse ride is nice,' said 6-year-old Sadaf through a gap-toothed grin as she had her face decorated like a mouse. 

The city of almost 6 million people is a virtual fortress. Major buildings are protected by concrete and barbed wire, roads are choked with traffic as former thoroughfares are blocked to prevent suicide bombers reaching potential targets like the Presidential Palace. Gun-toting security forces guard almost every street corner.

Afghanistan has been at war for more than 30 years, and while U.S. and NATO combat troops prepare to leave next month, the Taliban insurgency shows no sign of abating.

Few families in Kabul have been untouched by the violence, said Almas Qaseemi, the park's deputy general manager. 'The park is a place for entertainment, and there is not much of that in Afghanistan.'

Bringing joy: £960,000 has been invested in the park, which sees thousands flock to its gates every day

'We have a great feeling when we see our people forget their sorrows for a few minutes and smile when they come here,' Qaseemi said.

Thousands come every day, he said, peaking on the weekly Friday holiday at close to 10,000.

The park is set on 24 acres of land owned by the Kabul Municipal Government and leased for five years to a private company called Mufkora - which means 'concept' in English.

Rahela Kohistani, the municipality's cultural director, said that $1.5million(£960,000) has been invested in the park with the municipal authority taking 26 percent of profits and the rest going to Mufkora.

'So far we are happy, and it seems that people are happy, too,' she said.

For Ishfaq Ahmad Adeb, 20, who spends his days at City Park as Tom the cat, and 18-year-old Omid who plays Minnie Mouse, the children's joy rubs off.

'When the children see me in this outfit, they really believe that Minnie Mouse has come to Kabul,' said Omid. 'They laugh and try to shake hands with me, they really enjoy it.'
