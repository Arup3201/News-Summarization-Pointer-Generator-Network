An adopted man's book - in which he claims he discovered that his biological father was the Zodiac killer - is set to be published on Tuesday.

Details of the book, called The Most Dangerous Animal of All, were hidden by 'dozens' of staff at publisher HarperCollins, according to a report by New York Magazine.

Son of a killer? Gary Stewart, pictured, claims in a new book that his biological father was the Zodiac killer

Is this Stewart's father? A publicist for the upcoming book says the father's mugshot bears a 'strong resemblance' to the police sketch of the Zodiac killer

Writer Gary Stewart, who wrote the book alongside crime author Susan Mustafa, realized his father's true identity 'after twelve years of research,' HarperCollins publicist Tina Andreadis told New York.

Stewart, according to the book's description, looked for his father after his birth mother contacted him for the first time ever. It claims that 'forensic evidence' helped show his father was responsible for the Zodiac crimes.

The book, Andreadis told New York, was found to be 'legally sound' by HarperCollins' lawyers - though she admitted that the publisher did not contact the San Francisco Police Department for review, who she said 'knew more than they're willing to admit.'

The Zodiac killer killed at least five people and injured two more between 1968 and 1969 in the San Francisco Bay Area. The killer sent cryptograms to media outlets, some of which remain unsolved.

Stewart's father has a criminal record and his mug shot resembles the Zodiac Killer's police sketch, Andreadis told New York.

'If you look at Gary’s photo next to the sketch of the Zodiac next to his father’s mug shot, you can see that there is very clearly more than just a passing resemblance,' she told the magazine. 'They look alike.'

'He didn’t want to believe,' she added. 'I don’t think most people want to know that their father is a notorious serial killer.'
