A perverse loophole in the Affordable Care Act will soon make illegal immigrants more affordable to hire than native-born Americans.

Once millions of people living in the U.S. illegally receive resident cards and work permits, they will be eligible to hold jobs and earn wages. But they won't qualify for Obamacare benefits or subsidies.

That means employers with 50 or more full-time workers can't be penalized for failing to provide them with company-based medical insurance. Ordinarily that fine amounts to $3,000 per worker, per year.

The end result is a strange, looking-glass scenario – an incentive to hire people who today can't legally hold jobs – that will also hand President Obama's political adversaries another rhetorical cudgel to beat him with.

America's overall labor participation rate – the percentage of able-bodied working-age adults with jobs – is at its lowest since 1978, despite rosy federal government numbers showing the official unemployment rate has decreased in recent years.

NOT A PROBLEM: Obama insisted Tuesday in Chicago that immigration reform would grow the economy and add jobs in the long run

BACK OF THE LINE: Native-born Americans could find themselves with one strike against them because they will cost an extra $3,000 to hire if a company with 50 or more employees doesn't provide insurance to all its workers  

The contrast is due to a Bureau of Labor Statistics accounting trick: The agency releases a number each month after adjusting it to exclude from the labor pool everyone who has given up on finding a job in the previous six months.

The dearth of middle-class jobs, however, persists. And that job market will tighten when today's illegal immigrants become tomorrow's job-eligible immigrants – and they’re cheaper to hire.

The Washington Times first reported Tuesday on the odd consequence of the temporary deportation-free status Obama aims to confer on about 5 million illegal immigrants for three years 

'If it is true that the president's actions give employers a $3,000 incentive to hire those who came here illegally, he has added insult to injury,' Texas Republican Rep. Lamar Smith told the Times.

'The president's actions would have just moved those who came here illegally to the front of the line, ahead of unemployed and underemployed Americans.'

The White House did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday as administration officials prepared to pardon some turkeys and brine others.

Obama, however, pledged on Tuesday during a speech in Chicago that his mainstreaming of illegal immigrants will not drive down Americans' wages.

'Immigrants are good for the economy,' he said. 'We keep on hearing that they’re bad, but a report by my Council of Economic Advisers put out last week shows how the actions we’re taking will grow our economy for everybody.'

The Times reported that a comprehensive immigration reform bill that cleared the Senate last year – the one the White House favored before it stalled amid partisan squabbles – created the same unusual hiring incentive.

That bill, called the 'Gang of Eight' proposal because four Democrats and four Republicans crafted it, gave put illegal immigrants on probationary status that conferred work eligibility but not public entitlements.

JOBS PROGRAM: Illegal immigrants and their families may soon also be thanking the White House for preferential treatment in the American labor market

Brian Rogers, a spokesman for Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain – one of the 'eight' – said Tuesday that Obamacare's entire employer insurance mandate should be scrapped in order to 'eliminate the incentive to hire people who are ineligible for Obamacare subsidies.'

The Obamacare-immigration loophole has existed since at least 2012 as part of a White House strategy to quell criticism about the preisdent's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) program.

DACA provided safe haven for hundreds of thousands of people brought to the U.S. as children prior to mid-2007. Republicans howled at the time that the new swell of mainstreamed so-called 'DREAMers' would sap resources and be a drain on public benefits, including Obamacare.

The Homeland Security Department later carved out a special status for the DREAMers, deeming them legal residents but denying them access to benefit programs.

Obama's executive actions on immigration will only apply to people who were in the United States by January 1, 2010.
