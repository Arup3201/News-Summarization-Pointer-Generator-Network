The £35billion the Government estimates it loses to tax avoidance and fraud is the ‘tip of the iceberg’, MPs said yesterday.

Edward Troup, tax commissioner at HM Revenue and Customs, told the Public Accounts Committee they had no projections for how much would be collected if the revenues of major companies that have faced accusations of tax avoidance were included.

The ‘tax gap’ of £35bn owed to the Treasury through evasion, avoidance and fraud was revealed this month.

However Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons spending watchdog, said it does not include the millions of tax which some argue firms like Starbucks, Google and Amazon should pay in the UK.

Grilling senior HMRC officials in Parliament  yesterday, she said: ‘It does not include a lot of what ordinary punters in the street think you should be collecting, particularly in regard to the large corporations.

‘The tax gap is really the tip of the iceberg in the gap between the money that you collect and the money if everyone paid their fair share,’ the public accounts committee chairman said.

Ms Hodge named Google, Facebook, Amazon and Starbucks as companies whose tax affairs had sparked public anger and doubts about whether they were paying their fair share in Britain.

She said:  ‘It looks to me that you should be litigating. Why have you not chosen to litigate and test your powers?

‘Why have you not litigated against one single internet company?’

She added: ‘Make a few cases, a few show cases. It’s so bloody obvious.’

Labour MP Austin Mitchell said HMRC ‘hounds’ individuals and small firms over small tax bills but takes a ‘supine attitude’ to global firms.

However, Jim Harra, Director of General Business Tax, repeatedly refused to comment on individual cases.

He would only say: ‘What we have to look for is: is there evidence that the offshore operation does nothing more than rubberstamp.’

Edward Troup, Tax Assurance Commissioner, added: ‘We make sure we collect the tax due under the law.’

Barney Jones, who worked for Google from 2002 until 2006, contacted the PAC earlier this year with claims Google has a system in place which diverts British profits through Ireland to the Bermuda tax haven and accused the company of 'cheating' the British taxpayer.

Google assert that all its sales are made in low-tax Ireland, rather than the UK, where corporation tax is just 12.5 per cent compared to 23 per cent in Britain.

Ms Hodge said his details had been passed to HMRC, who had spoken to Mr Jones but no action had been taken.

She demanded to be given a ‘back of the envelope’ figure for how much more tax would be raised if global firms were challenged, but the inspectors said it was not possible.

When HMRC had been challenged by MPs about the tax gap before they described it as a ‘health check’ on their performance.

Ms Hodge added: ‘It has now gone up. Does that mean HMRC is actually chronically, institutionally incapable of really collecting tax in the way that it should?

‘You say you are doing better and better and if you look at the money it is 0.2 per cent more.

‘In real terms you got less in tax in 2011-12 than you did in 2010-11. It should have gone up quite a lot.’

In January David Cameron told the Davos summit in Switzerland: ‘Businesses who think they can carry on dodging that fair share, or that they can keep on selling to the UK and setting up ever more complex tax arrangements abroad to squeeze their tax bills right down, well they need to wake up and smell the coffee, because the public who buy from them have had enough.’

Ms Hodge said HMRC had failed to act on the Prime Minister’s words.
