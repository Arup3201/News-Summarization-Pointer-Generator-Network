The mobile phone of Gerard Baden-Clay was connected in the early hours of the morning he reported his wife missing, but the murder-accused told police he was in bed sleeping, a court has heard.

Crown prosecutors have closed their case against Baden-Clay on the tenth day of his trial in Brisbane.

Passages from his wife's Allison Baden-Clay's diary were also read out during the day.

Prosecutor Todd Fuller also read out a number of admissions that have been accepted as facts.

One was that Baden-Clay's phone was connected up to a charger at 1.48am on April 20, 2012, and was removed at 6.18am.

The former real estate agent reported his wife missing from their Brookfield home in Brisbane's west at 7.15am that day.

A Brisbane court was some photographs of Allison Baden-Clay's diary, which contained lists of questions seemingly about her husband's affair

Baden-Clay told police during recorded interviews that were played to the jury that he went to bed about 10pm (AEST) the previous night, leaving his wife watching TV.

He told police he was a heavy sleeper and didn't hear whether his wife came to bed, but when he woke up she wasn't in the house.

Ten days later her body was found on a creek bed in Anstead, 13km away.

Mr Fuller went on to say it was also a fact that Mrs Baden-Clay contacted a life insurance broker on April 17, 2012, about her and her husband's life insurance policies.

She wanted to reduce the sum insured and the premiums.

On May 1, 2012, Baden-Clay contacted a life insurance company to determine how a claim could be made on his wife's policy, Mr Fuller said.

The diary included questions like 'How paid for hotels?' and 'Did she ever say - I feel bad because you're married?'

'Find whole thing dirty... still get sick in stomach,' Allison wrote in the diary, which police found underneath her bedside table

The prosecutor also said it was a fact that no payments were made towards a credit card in the couple's name between January 24, 2012, and May 13, 2012.

Two days before she was reported missing Allison Baden-Clay wrote in her diary that she felt 'dirty' and 'sick' about her husband's affair.

Jurors in Gerard Baden-Clay's murder trial have been shown photographs of pages of his wife's diary, which was recovered by police from under her bedside table.

The entry included a dot-point list over two pages of questions from Ms Baden-Clay, which seem to concern her husband's affair with colleague Toni McHugh.

Many of the questions were crossed out.

'Drive together - seats down - lie there afterwards - how many times - do afterwards,' part of the handwritten entry read.

'How paid for hotels? Did she ever say I feel bad because you're married?

'How many people in office knew that you knew? How did that feel?'

The diary continued: 'Really hurt - had so many opportunities to tell me - let me believe that it was all my fault and therefore I was at your mercy.

'Forced me to bow to you. Think that's where you wanted me.'

Further apparent questions for Baden-Clay were do you regret the whole thing or just being caught' and 'were you prepared to live with the guilt if I hadn't found out'.

The last words were: 'Find whole thing dirty - maybe I'm prudent (sic)? - still get sick in stomach.'

The court also heard that Allison's DNA was found in the boot of the couple's car. The sample came from a blood stain in the boot of the car

The entry also included a hand-drawn floor plan of an apartment which the court has previously heard was Ms McHugh's, scribbles that looked like children's drawings and entries dating back to 2010, including 'My Gratitude List' and 'Daily Disciplines'.

Baden-Clay has pleaded not guilty to the murder of his wife who went missing from their west Brisbane home in Brookfield on April 20, 2012.

Her body was discovered ten days later on a creek bed in Anstead, 13km away.

The court also heard today that Allison Baden-Clay's DNA was found in a car she owned with her husband.

A forensic scientist has told the Gerard Baden-Clay trial she tested a swab taken from a blood stain police found in the couple's Holden Captiva.

'The complete DNA profile obtained from the sample matched the reference DNA profile of Allison Baden-Clay,' Queensland Health forensic scientist Amanda Reeves told the Supreme Court.

She said the probability of the DNA belonging to someone else not related to the mother-of-three was one-in-5600 billion.

The DNA didn't match Mrs Baden-Clay's children, parents or brother, she said.

The court has heard police found the blood stain and a hair on an inside rear panel of the car on April 22, 2014, two days after Baden-Clay reported his wife missing.

Toni McHugh, Gerard Baden-Clay's former mistress, gave evidence to the court last week

The stain was located above the rear wheel arch next to a row of seats that could be folded down to make the boot larger.

Ms Reeves said tests on swabs taken from Mrs Baden-Clay's fingernails showed possible DNA from a second contributor but the levels were too low for interpretation.

Other forensic experts have previously told the court that injuries on Gerard Baden-Clay's face, noticed the day he reported his wife missing, looked like fingernail scratches.

Ms Reeves also said a swab taken from a towel in the bathroom of the couple's house matched Gerard Baden-Clay's DNA profile.

The court has previously heard a towel in the bathroom showed a positive reaction to blood.

Other areas of the house tested showed DNA levels too low for interpretation, Ms Reeves said.

Sergeant Brett Schnitzerling said he was photographing the car's interior on April 22, 2012 when he noticed the blood stain and pointed it out to a forensic police officer.

'When I first viewed it, I would have thought it was a drink stain or something,' he said.

The court heard police conducted a chemical test for blood which returned a positive result. A hair was also found at the base of the stain.
