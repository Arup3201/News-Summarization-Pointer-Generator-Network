He has long been a familiar face trackside on the Formula One circuit, sharing the triumphs and disappointments of his two times world champion brother.

But it seems the real star of the Hamilton family is Lewis's lesser known sibling, Nicolas.

The 22-year-old, who has a form of cerebral palsy, will make his debut in the British Touring Car Championship in June - making him the first ever disabled driver to compete in the series.

Hamilton suffers from spastic diplegia, a form of cerebral palsy, which affects the nerves and fibres controlling his legs, arms and hands, causing difficulty walking and pain. At times he needs a wheelchair.

But he is set to take part in five of the 10 rounds at Croft, Snetterton, Rockingham, Silverstone and the final meeting of the championship at Brands Hatch.

'Whilst I'm aiming to improve as a driver, I'm also hoping to inspire others to strive for their own personal goals, whatever their situation in life,' said Hamilton.

'Anyone can exceed expectations in one way or another and I hope to prove that when I race alongside, not just able-bodied drivers, but the best Touring Car drivers in the UK.'

Nicolas and his brother Lewis have a close relationship and both men were encouraged in their passion for the sport as children by their father, Anthony. 

Nicolas was trackside for both his elder brother's Formula One world championship triumphs in Brazil in 2008 and last year in Abu Dhabi.

And when he himself made his racing debut in 2011, as he took his place on the grid at Brands Hatch, he was watched proudly by Lewis who had made a 13,000 mile round trip from preparations for the Malaysian Grand Prix to support his younger brother. 

At the time he said: 'Lewis is seven years older and had competed in the UK Karting Championship since he was eight. 

'From the time I was born, my parents took me every weekend with them to watch him race around the UK and Europe.'

'I became a real racing nerd - I knew all the drivers and talked about karting all the time. I wanted to have a go, but when I got into a kart the noise scared me. I was also worried that I wouldn't be able to control the brake with my foot.

'My father encouraged me, but when I drove a kart for the first time in an empty car park, I hit a high kerb and went over a drop into 6in of water.

Cerebral palsy is the general term for a number of neurological conditions that affect movement and co-ordination.

Specifically, cerebral palsy is caused by a problem in the parts of the brain responsible for controlling muscles.

The condition can occur if the brain develops abnormally or is damaged before, during or shortly after birth.

About one in 400 British children is thought to have Cerebral Palsy. 

The more premature the baby, the higher the risk and, according to the charity Scope, around 1,800 children are diagnosed every year.

The symptoms of CP vary between individuals, but include muscle stiffness or floppiness, muscle weakness, random and uncontrolled body movements, balance and co-ordination problems.

Some people with the condition may have communication and learning difficulties, although intelligence is often unaffected.

Some have problems walking while others are profoundly disabled and require lifelong care.

Those with cerebral palsy often have other related conditions or problems, including epilepsy, learning difficulties, visual and hearing impairment, difficulties speaking or understanding other people speak, and delayed growth. 

'I decided that was the end of it, especially when the engine started smoking. But Dad said that if you fall off a horse, you should get back on straight away.' 

Mr Hamilton, 53, added: 'We tried to give Nic as normal a life as possible, and when I say that, I mean independent and tough because that's what real life is.

'He is a determined young man and deserves every opportunity. We trust that he will do whatever it takes to keep himself safe.' 

Nicolas was born prematurely at 31 weeks weighing just 4lb 4oz. As he grew he found it impossible to walk.

When he reached four, he had a major operation to release the tendons in his ankles, knees and groin. 

Eight weeks later, the plaster was removed and he began walking with the aid of a miniature frame, and at the age of 15, he ventured back into a kart. 

He says: 'By that time I didn't need much persuading. I developed my leg muscles by walking as much as I could unaided, which wasn't so easy.'

He is said to train hard in the gym to strengthen his arm, hand and leg muscles to make sure that he minimises the disadvantage of his disability when driving. 

He has been granted a guest entry by British Touring Car boss Alan Gow and will take to the wheel of an AmD Tuning Audi S3.

Shaun Hollamby, team principal of AmD Tuning, said: 'BTCC is a fiercely competitive series with hard wheel-to-wheel racing action on track and we have developed Nicolas's 2015 program to ensure he enters the Championship with a level of preparation. 

'We have a number of test sessions over the coming months, which will enable Nicolas to acclimatise to the car. 

'Having observed Nicolas's racing in the Renault Clio Cup and the ETCC, we know he is quick learner and a strong competitor, and we're looking forward to working with him this season.'
