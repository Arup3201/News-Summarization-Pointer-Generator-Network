With audiences lapping up the sprawling and grandiose homes in TV shows like Grand Designs, it's clear that many of us aspire to bigger houses with breathtaking views and endless gardens.

But Polish architect Jakub Szczesny has positioned himself at the other end of the spectrum - by creating a home that is so narrow there is not even room for a staircase.

At less than five feet at its widest point, and a pinch over three feet at its narrowest, the Warsaw house - built in an alley between two other buildings - does not even have room for windows. It is claimed it is the skinniest house in the world. 

There's not even enough room for a window - sunlight comes through small holes in the bedroom.

Slimmed down: Front and back views of the house in Warsaw which has no windows. Sunlight comes 
through two holes in the bedroom wall so you can tell when it is day 
time

Technical challenge: The framework for the house was constructed off-site and slotted into place by a team of builders

Because
there is only a total floor space of 46 square feet in the two-floor 
iron structure, residents have to use a ladder to go up a level.

The project is called the Keret house - named after Israeli writer and filmmaker Etgar Keret, who has headed the art project and will live in the property, on-and-off,
for six months.

It does not offer much in terms of luxury. The bathroom is nothing more than a toilet with a shower head installed almost directly above it.

Aspiring cooks will also have a tough time in the Keret house. There is minimal space for cutting, washing and cooking.

It is best to use fresh food in the home. The fridge only offers space for two drinks.

At just a metre-and-a-half wide the Keret House is thought to be the narrowest in the world. It was built as a comment on the lack of housing being built in Poland

Slender: The building is designed to make the most of the very small amount of usable space

Israeli writer and film director Etgar Keret will live in the home for six months, on-and-off.

Inviting friends for dinner is not really on the cards. There are only  two fixed seats at the dinner table. That sticks out of the wall.

The bedroom is no less spartan. It is functional though, featuring a tiny bed and desk.

Books can be stored in an alcove behind the bed.

'Research shows we are approaching a social disaster because too little living space is built,' the architect said.

'You don't need that much space to live in, so it is worth considering building smaller scaled, cheaper housing.'

When Keret moves out of the property he will give it to a colleague.

One of the buildings next to the house dates from before the war while the other was built after it.

Before the Second World War most of Warsaw's architecture was brick based.

But with the city almost completely destroyed by Nazi Germany, the communist rulers of Poland rebuilt the city in concrete.

The house is located at the point where the Nazis established the largest Jewish ghetto in occupied Europe. It is officially opened tomorrow.
