He's called Pippa Middleton ugly, Adele fat and Lana del Rey fake and now Karl Lagerfeld has even taken to insulting potential customers.

Never one to mince his words, Lagerfeld said that his new range of sunglasses would help to 'balance out ugly faces' in the behind-the-scenes video for the Karl Lagerfeld eyewear campaign.

Lagerfeld, who personally shot the images for the campaign, appeared in the clip sporting his trademark sunglasses and was filmed chatting to models Saskia de Brauw and Jon K.

Speaking about the new range, Lagerfeld said: 'They [the glasses] balance ugly faces and they make beautiful faces more beautiful.'

Bizarrely, the dark glasses fanatic then added: 'I wear glasses all the time, so it's like selling my soul.'

The German designer is no stranger to controversy, and has racked up an impressive number of offended parties during his 66-year career.

Most recently he took a swipe at French actress, Audrey Tatou, describing her portrayal of Coco Chanel in Coco Before Chanel as 'unsexy'.

'She played it like women's lib,' he explained, 'like Simone de Beauvoir 30 years before The Second Sex. No, no, no, no. Chanel was a different kind of woman.'

Apparently Mr Lagerfeld's publicists were 'horrified' by his his remarks about Miss Tautou, especially as she was formerly the face of Chanel No. 5.

However, he is not alone in his criticism and when the Anne Fontaine-directed feature, Coco Before Chanel, was released four years ago others also picked holes in her performance.

Other recent controversies include revelations that he would marry his cat, Choupette, if he could.

‘[There is] no marriage, yet, for human beings and animals,' said the Chanel supremo. ‘I never thought that I would fall in love like this with a cat.’

So famous for his confrontational way with words has Lagerfeld become, a new book is to be released in September that brings together the best and bitchiest Lagerfeld quotes.

The World According To Karl is the brainchild of Patrick Mauriés, Jean-Christophe Napias and Sandrine Gulbenkian, and will feature illustrations by artist Charles Ameline.

Choice quotes featured in the book include his famous dismissal of Russian men as ugly and his unique take on Greece's financial woes.

'If I was a woman in Russia I would be a lesbian, as the men are very ugly,' he quipped.

'There are a few handsome ones, like Naomi Campbell's boyfriend, but there you see the most beautiful women and the most horrible men.'

On Greece, the fashion maestro sniffed: 'Greece needs to work on a cleaner image. It's a big problem, as they have this reputation of being so corrupt.

'You can't be sure the money will go where it's supposed to go,' he concluded. 'Nobody wants Greece to disappear, but they have really disgusting habits. Italy as well.'
