The terrier- schnauzer mix is believed to have subsisted on McDonald's scraps and cigars that were left in the Buick.

'It's devastating to hear, and then it's inspiring to hear at the same time,' Tori Fugate with KC Pet Project said.

The animal rescue officers who found the dog - who has since been named Kia, are now trying to track down her owners by using the registration number of the car. 

They say they will face criminal charges if found, The Indy Channel reports.

Ms Fugate said the dog had not stopped shaking.

She said: 'Hearing how this little girl has lived in this car for this long in those conditions is just amazing.

'She's really scared. She has been since she got here.'

While Kia was dehydrated and emaciated, she is expected to survive.
