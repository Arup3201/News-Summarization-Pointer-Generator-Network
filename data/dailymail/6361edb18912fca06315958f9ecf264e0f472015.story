Forensic teams were yesterday scouring a concealed shaft and sewers yards from the spot where Madeleine McCann vanished.

After sniffer dogs found the pit on Tuesday, detectives from Scotland Yard moved in to seal off the area with large white tents.

Five forensic officers were called in to start excavating the shaft and were seen removing several bags of evidence.

Investigation: Forensic police officers have been pictured preparing to 
examine a hole (left) in an area of wasteland 1,000ft from Portugal's Ocean 
Club resort where Madeleine McCann (right) went missing in 2007

Development: Scotland Yard officers can be seen moving a white gazebo over the hole in the ground

Detectives were also scouring sewers 
in Praia da Luz, but a spokesman from Scotland Yard refused to provide 
‘a running commentary’ on whether any leads have so far been found.

British police have been combing scrubland 300 yards away from the villa where three-year-old Madeleine disappeared in 2007.

The
 area is the size of three football pitches and is thought to contain at
 least 12 key areas of interest which officers are planning to examine.

It was chosen because a suspect who was carrying a young girl was seen 
walking in the direction of the site on the night that Madeleine was 
last seen alive.

More equipment: As evening approached, detectives brought in more equipment to examine the area

Search: Scotland Yard detectives will reportedly search sewers this afternoon as the team continue to use radar equipment (pictured) to explore the coastal scrubland of Praia da Luz in Portugal's Algarve region

Examining the scene: British police officers discuss how best to progress earlier today

Aerial surveillance: A drone is employed to help examine the site from the sky

The scrubland is one of three separate locations which will form part of the extensive search operation.

On
 Tuesday sniffer dogs led their police handlers to a pit concealed by 
bushes. The shaft had an opening measuring around 5ft by 3ft which was 
covered with wooden planks, a large corrugated iron sheet and mounds of 
earth.

The thick 
surrounding overgrowth was cleared with chainsaws and mowers before 
spades were used to raise the cover, which is thought to have been in 
place for years.

Officers could be seen removing evidence in a wheelbarrow before carrying several closed bags away for further tests.

Area: The force has identified 41 areas of work in the region seven years after Madeleine disappeared

Police continue to dig and patrol with dogs in a bid to find clues connected to Madeleine's disappearance

Search: The advanced radar detection equipment has been flown in to scour the plot of land

Map: The search site is 300 metres from the apartment at the Ocean Club resort in Praia da Luz and the tapas bar her parents were dining at and close to where a suspect was seen with a girl in his arms on the night she was abducted in May 2007

A
 local source said: ‘The discovery of the hole came as a surprise. 
Police are meant to be here for five to seven days but this may delay 
things.’

Elsewhere on the site, sewers are being analysed by British 
detectives using micro cameras and fibreoptic cables.

Kate and Gerry McCann (pictured speaking to press shortly after Madeleine's disappearance) are bracing themselves for 'significant news' but are not in Portugal, reports claim

The
 complex system of unused piping was installed as part of failed plans 
to build a hotel on the land before Madeleine disappeared.

Detectives
 are also using ground-penetrating radar equipment and have so far found
 the bones of pigs and cattle – which were photographed and analysed 
before being ruled out as evidence.

Yesterday
 two cadaver dogs who were used in the search for murdered Welsh 
five-year-old April Jones in 2012 were helping to search the scrubland.

The seven-year-old English springer spaniels – Tito and Muzzy – can cover a far larger area than humans in much less time.

In the past they have uncovered bodies more than 20 years after they disappeared.

And
 a British company whose experts have in the past worked to identify 
bodies after the 9/11 and 7/7 terrorist attacks has sent some of their 
forensic archaeologists and anthropologists to Portugal to help with the
 case.

The work is due to 
run at least until the weekend, and last night local sources said that 
Scotland Yard has applied for a seven-day extension to the dig.

The search comes after David Cameron ordered a reinvestigation of the Madeleine case in 2011.

As part of Operation Grange, Scotland Yard has made 287 requests for action, which identify 41 priority areas of work.

Madeleine’s parents Kate, 46, and 45-year-old Gerry McCann have not travelled to Portugal but are being kept closely informed.
