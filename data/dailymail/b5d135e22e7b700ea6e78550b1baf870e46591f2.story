Royal Ascot and the wedding season are just around the corner, so it's the perfect time to learn how to create a new occasion hair style.

Finger waves, set hair, loads of 
shine and ornate hair jewels were signature aspects of great hair in the Roaring Twenties.

They really had it all in terms 
of flawless style and vampish glamour, and with the upcoming release of Baz Luhrmann's Great Gatsby film remake starring Carey Mulligan, now is the perfect time to celebrate the era.

FEMAIL visited Daniel Galvin's salon in central London to learn from celebrity hair stylist Frankie  how to style your hair at home, the Daisy Buchanan way.

1. Blow dry clean hair with a round brush, for volume, and spray lightly with a hairspray.

2. Part the hair in a deep side parting - straight works better than angled.

3. Take sections of hair of between 1-2 square inches in size and curl forwards with a medium barrel tong. We used Babyliss Pro - and collectively agree they make the best hair tongs. You'll need to take nine sections (3x3) from the thicker side of hair and three from the thinner side.

5. Clip the curls in with section grips 
and spray with hairspray. We used (and love) L'Oreal Infinium. It holds like glue, won't make your hair look dusty - and won't break the bank.

6. Scoop the length of the hair 
lightly into a low ponytail (ideally this will be three inches or longer in length). Curl sections of it outwards from the centre lightly 
with the tong.

6. When ready, take out the 
clips and brush out gently with a natural bristle brush, set them into finger waves with your hand following the 
curl that is already there. Do this all the way around your head leaving the parting you have made firmly in place.

7.
 Grab your section grips once more and place them around the hair to hold the curl waves in place. Make sure curled waves fall neatly all around the head and over the ponytail.

Keep the grips in for as long 
as possible. Half an hour will do but you can leave them in all day for a long-lasting style.

Brush curls out gently set them into finger waves with your hand following the curl that is already there. Grip

8.  Remove the section grips gently and carefully so as not to move the hair.

They will be relatively light waves, but for a bolder look, a thinner barrel will get you tighter finger waves.

9. Back brush the ponytail curls lightly for volume then spin them in on themselves, fix with kirby grips 
and spray. Don't worry if they are slightly uneven, it looks delicate.

10. Curl the end of the thick front section of hair in on itself tidily, to make this a statement section of the hair style. Fix on a darling piece of costume hair jewellery either here or at the top of the makeshift bun. We used Ruby & Frost pieces (£78 each).

The DIY Silver Bronx, by Andy Evans, John Lewis cocktail King

'Although they originally emerged in the nineteenth-century, cocktails were popularised during the prohibition era as a means of disguising the unpalatable taste of illegal (or ‘bootleg’) alcohol.

'One popular cocktail of the Gatsby era was the Silver Bronx.'

1. 'To make a Silver Bronx you’ll need: a cocktail shaker, martini glass, dry vermouth, sweet (red) vermouth, dry gin, smooth orange juice, an egg and plenty of ice.'

2. 'Start off by rinsing the ice with a capful of sweet vermouth and a capful of dry vermouth. Shake, then dispose of the vermouth (it’s only there to flavour the ice!).'

3. 'Then add 50 ml dry gin, 50 ml orange juice and the white of the egg to the ice and shake well. The egg white gives a pleasing texture to the drink and an attractive foam.'

4. 'Strain into a martini glass (ideally chilled), garnished with a maraschino cherry.'

Great Gatsby Pop-Up, Harrods, 9 - 20 May

Premium vodka elit by Stolichnaya transports Harrods guests back to the glitz and the martini swilling nights of the Roaring Twenties with the Great Gatsby Pop-Up in the London store.

Between 9 and 20 May, visitors will be able to visit the pop-up in the exclusive Tasting Room within the Wine Shop where elit by Stolichnaya will be serving their ultra-luxury martini on selected days between 2:00pm and 8:00pm (1:00pm – 6:00pm on Sundays).

elit by Stolichnaya Martini

The underground bar and lounge in the heart of Knightsbridge
is transformed with a moody 1920s decor.

Cocktail-making sessions will
take place at the main bar of Harrods’ Wine Shop with expert mixologist
Wayne Collins and his team.

During
the prohibition era vodka replaced gin as the spirit of choice and no 
vodka is more suited to a complex sophisticated cocktail than elit by 
Stolichnaya, consistently rated as one of the finest white spirits in 
the world.

The iron fist in the velvet glove, this is a drink to be treated with respect. Make the elit by Stolichnaya Martini at home.

Ingredients50ml Elit by Stolichnaya, 20ml French vermouth, 10ml elderflower liqueur, 2 dashes orange bitters.MethodHalf-fill a cocktail shaker with ice and stir in all the ingredients. Pour through a julep strainer into a chilled martini or coupette glass, and garnish with lemon.

1. Follow steps 1-5 from ultimate up-do instructions - but only curl the hair on the thick side of the parting. Make sure the parting is very deep so the finger-waved section looks like a statement rather than a half done 'do'.

2. Section the rest of the hair into 7-10 sections, depending on 
thickness. Make sure they are bigger than those atop your head - ideally
2-3 square inches. For the length of the hair we are aiming for a looser result: move of
a wave, less of a curl.

3. Curl the sections upwards. Grip and spray. Leave all curls pinned in for as long as
possible. Half an hour will do but if you stay in them all day the 
style will last longer.

4. When you're ready, remove the grips from the length of your hair, brush it out lightly with a natural bristle brush and spray.

5. Once they are loose remove the grips from the curls on top of your head, brush them through gently  following the curl that is already there and manouevre them carefully into finger waves. Grip them with section grips and curl the end in on itself tidily. This is the statement area of your hairstyle.

Once length curls are loose remove the grips from the curls on top of your head, and manoeuvre them carefully

6. Once the top section of finger waves is set in place, remove the section grips and finish with spray and a hair jewel at the neck of the last curl. You can tuck the hair from the thin side of the parting behind your ear or even sweep the whole of it over your shoulder for a dramatic long hair look.

Now all you need is some gorgeous (faux) furs, an embellished frock and some dapper gentlemen to complete your look, as modelled here by the elfin Carey Mulligan in the upcoming Great Gatsby remake

Tongs: We used Babyliss Pro and agree they make the best hair tongs.

Hairspray: We used (and love) L'Oreal Infinium. It holds like glue, won't make your hair look dusty, and won't break the bank.

Brush: We used a Denman natural bristle brush. Avoid splashing out on a £50 for Mason Pearson one - Denman, at a fraction of the price, are just as good.
