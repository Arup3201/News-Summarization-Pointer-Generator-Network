It is, admittedly, a gesture that could be open to misinterpretation.

But when charity chiefs asked the three party leaders to pose with thumb and forefinger just a couple of inches apart, they were merely hoping to spread their message that the world was ‘this close’ to eradicating polio.

However, David Cameron and Nick Clegg turned down the request, for fear of media mischief-makers  taking the pictures out of context.

Ed Miliband, on the other hand, readily 
agreed – even though his brother David never lived down the infamous 
photograph of him holding a banana.

For all of them, it was a calculated political gamble: weighing up the chances of facing humiliation for striking a pose that wags could misconstrue as a smutty joke about a man’s endowment, against the clear benefits of publicly backing such a good cause. Only time will tell which of the leaders made the right call.

Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg also refused for fear of the photographs being taken out of context

As one Government insider said: ‘In the age of mass media, what  politicians look like can be as important as what they say. ‘Photos can be used to ridicule them 
for years to come over any political or personal issues. It is not the 
PM’s job to provide Private Eye magazine with front-cover photos making 
him look stupid. Ed  Miliband may regret posing in the long run.’

But
allies of Mr Miliband defended his decision, saying: ‘Cynics may choose
to laugh, but getting rid of polio is far more important.’

Instead of making the gesture, the Prime Minister and his deputy posed behind posters promoting the campaign. However, it seems that they might have been overly cautious – as both have previously been photographed inadvertently making the gesture in entirely unrelated, and innocuous, circumstances.

The ‘This Close’ campaign is headed 
by Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who has given more than £400 million to
the worldwide drive to eradicate polio, led by Rotary International.

Scores
of politicians, businessmen, religious leaders and celebrities have 
posed with their thumb and forefinger apart to promote the campaign – 
ranging from South Korean pop star Psy to South Africa’s Archbishop 
Desmond Tutu.

Although polio has been conquered in 
most Western countries, it is still endemic in Afghanistan, India, 
Nigeria and Pakistan. Mr Gates has spoken movingly of its impact. He 
said: ‘I was in India and saw what this horrible disease does to 
children. I was in a slum in Delhi, and I held a nine-month-old girl 
named Hashmin in my arms. She obviously didn’t understand why people 
were poking her legs and looking so serious.

‘But she’ll never be able to kick a ball around, never be able to play hide-and-seek with her friends, because she has polio. As I held Hashmin, I thought, “We can end this.” ’

Ed Miliband agreed to pose for the charity campaign. Allies of Miliband argue that getting rid of Polio is more important than a photograph

Rotary International has set up a website featuring photographs of people performing the thumb-and forefinger-gesture, which it bills as ‘the world’s biggest commercial’.

The charity says: ‘After nearly 30 years, and after immunising more than two billion children against polio, we are on the brink of making history. We are This Close to ending polio for ever. You can take action by showing your support. Snap a photo of yourself making the This Close sign and upload it. ‘Your involvement will help convince world leaders that support for polio eradication is global.’
