lung after the accident at the beach in Malibu, earlier this week.

The released 911 call also comes as both Maria and her estranged husband Arnold Schwarzenegger have banded together for the sake of their family following the accident.

As 63-year-old Arnold was pictured arriving at the hospital today to join Maria in her bedside vigil, the former couple released a joint statement about the his hospitalisation. It read: 'A few days ago our son Christopher suffered an accident at the beach.

Family support: In a statement, the former couple said, ''While it has been a very scary week, Christopher is surrounded by his family and friends'

'While it has been a very scary week,
Christopher is surrounded by his family and friends.  He is a brave boy
and is expected to make a full recovery.'

The
statement continues: 'On behalf of our entire family, we want to 
sincerely thank the paramedics and lifeguards who responded so swiftly 
as well as the doctors, nurses, emergency room and hospital staff who 
have cared for our son. 

'They
have been extraordinary to him and to us. We thank everyone for their 
thoughts and prayers and ask for respect and privacy for Christopher and
our family.'

Emergency dash: Arnold has remained at Christopher's bedside in Intensive Care as
much as possible

Injured: Christopher, 13, was rushed to hospital following a surfing accident at Malibu beach

While
both his parents have been a constant presence at his bedside, 
Christopher's siblings Patrick and Katherine sent out messages of 
gratitude to well-wishers over Twitter.

Katherine wrote: 'Thank you guys for ur concern and 
prayers for my baby brother! He's a tough little guy and getting 
better!' Please keep praying for him!'

Patrick added: 'Thank you everyone for your messages 
about my brother. This kid is strongest kid I ever seen. Keep praying.'

Gratitude: His sister Katherine tweeted her thanks to well-wishers

Christopher is the former couple's 
youngest child - Patrick is 17, Katherine is 21 and they have an other daughter, Christina, 19.

The teen was boogie boarding while on a trip to the beach with his mother when the accident happened.

'Christopher has been in ICU since Sunday,' a source tells America's People magazine.

'Maria has not left his side and is sleeping at hospital.'

Joseph, Schwarzenegger's love child with former housekeeper Mildred Baena, was born just five days after Christopher in 1997. 

Still, the latest family crisis did not get in the way of Schwarzenegger filing his response to Shriver's divorce petition.

In court documents lodged July 20 his lawyer, Bob Kaufman checked the box asking the judge to refuse Shriver spousal support.

In her original filing, Shriver asked for spousal support in her petition.

The papers also show that Schwarzenegger - like Shriver - is asking for joint custody of the couple's two minor children.

Differences aside: The former couple are showing a united front for the sake of their son, pictured in 2006, despite their messy divorce

However, a new report from TMZ claims that The Terminator star never even read the court documents denying Maria spousal support, partially because he was dealing with his son's medical crisis, and partially because he was relying on his lawyer.

He plans on filing revised, more respectful court documents, one that won't deny her alimony.

Shriver is asking Schwarzenegger to pay for her attorney's fees, according to the papers.

But Schwarzenegger's response asks that the judge make each party foot the bill for their respective lawyers.

According
to U.S. reports, the couple did not enter into a prenuptial agreement a
the time of the marriage so under California law both parties are 
entitled to a 50/50 split of all earnings and property accumulated 
during their 25-year marriage.

The pair are estimated to be worth around $400 million.
