An Alpaca has been rescued from life with a gang of bikies.

Cleo was saved from the Gypsy Jokers outlaw motorcycle gang clubhouse in Sydney, on Wednesday, after police raided the venue.

The brown female Alpaca was being kept in a paddock at the rear of the building.

She was allegedly stolen from a property in Bringelly, NSW, in February and the RSPCA are now hoping to reunite her with her real owners.

An RSPCA spokesperson told MailOnline: 'She was found in pretty good condition. The vets have had a good look over her and there are no broken bones or anything.'

'She's just in our animal shelter at the moment, it's got paddocks and stables and she's living with a couple of very cute baby goats called Ben and Billy,' she added.

But Cleo wasn't the only thing police scooped during the dramatic raid.

They also seized a loaded .32 calibre revolver, a loaded pistol and approximately 700 rounds of ammunition.

And officers discovered more than 200 tablets, believed to be MDMA, in the bolt hole.

The Gypsy Jokers motorcycle gang, who originally formed in San Francisco, California on April Fool's Day, 1956, are one of the most notorious and violent motorcycle gangs in both the US and in Australia.

In 2008, police forced the Gypsy Jokers to dismantle its clubhouse fortifications in Perth.

The gang had set-up a concrete front wall, surveillance cameras and modified doors on the building and claimed the security was needed in the area as the burglary rate was high.

Investigators from the Gangs Squad's Strike Force Raptor are investigating Wednesday's findings and police expect to make arrests.

The seizure of the items comes during Operation Unification, a joint initiative involving police agencies from across Australia, which is focused on getting illicit firearms out of the hands of criminals.
