Gone: Five-year-old Nathan O'Brien went missing from his grandparents house sometime Sunday night or Monday morning

Parents of a missing Canadian boy issued an emotional plea to bring him home yesterday, after he disappeared earlier this week from a sleepover at his grandparents house.

Nathan O'Brien, 5, was reported missing along with his grandparents Alvin and Kathryn Liknes, 66 and 53, when mother Jennifer O'Brien found her parents' Calgary home empty Monday morning.

The grandparents are not considered suspects in the case as investigators found evidence that all three left the home against their will.

At the press conference on Wednesday, Nathan's father Rod O'Brien cried as he spoke about his beloved middle son.

'To whoever has Nathan, please find it in your heart to drop off our little angel Nathan, so he can be rescued and reunited with his brothers and his family,' Mr O'Brien said.

Jennifer O'Brien also spoke, telling her son to have courage.

'Stay strong, Nathan. We know you are our superhero and I just need you to stay strong and we are going to see you.'

'We can't be with you right now, but the best people who can be with you other than us are your grandparents,' Mrs O'Brien said of her parents. 'I know Grandma is holding you so tight right now, and they are doing everything in their power to keep you safe.'

Mrs O'Brien last saw her son Sunday night, after helping her parents all day with a garage sale as they were downsizing to move into a new Edmonton home.

She left her parents home around 10pm and Nathan stayed behind to have a sleepover with his grandparents.

When she returned 12 hours later in the morning, all three were gone.

An Amber Alert was issued for Nathan later that evening, but investigators so far have not named a suspect.

Investigators have not said much about what they found in the home, but there is visible an 8-meter-long drag mark of what looks to be recently cleaned up dark liquid that runs from the home's side door to the driveway.

'We have a big mystery on our hands right now, we don’t know where these people are,' said Inspector Keith Cain.

'We’re still very optimistic they are alive.'

Investigators are now asking those who attended the garage sale on Sunday to attend a meeting at the Parkhill Community Hall today. Officers want the shoppers to bring with them their purchases so they can figure out what was or wasn't taken from the home. The meeting is running from 10am to 10pm.

Before the press conference on Wednesday, the family considered announcing a reward but decided against it since police said it might not be helpful right now.

Authorities say there was no custody issues with the family since Nathan is the O'Brien's biological son and they are still married.

Nathan is described as three-feet tall with curly blond hair and brown eyes. He was last seen wearing peach-colored shorts and a blue-striped hoodie.

Alvin Liknes is six-feet tall, 200 pounds with grey and blond hair and was wearing black shorts. Authorities say he has a distinctive walk. His wife Kathryn is five-foot-three, 120 pounds and has reddish-brown hair with green eyes.

Since the three family members were reported missing, authorities have received over 100 tips.
