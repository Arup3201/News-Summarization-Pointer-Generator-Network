A gaffe-prone crime tsar dubbed the 'David Brent of law enforcement' is being investigated by an independent watchdog over whether she was uninsured during a road smash.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission has taken over the probe into Kent police commissioner Ann Barnes - who was initially being investigated by her own force.

The £85,000-a-year crime chief, who appeared in a widely-derided Channel 4 documentary about her role earlier this year, crashed her soft-top Mercedes into another car before hitting a tree in Dartford, Kent.

Crime tsar: Kent police commissioner Ann Barnes, pictured with her 'battle bus' Ann Force One, is being investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission over whether she drove without insurance

The Mail on Sunday previously revealed she was being investigated by her own force over the crash, which happened on September 16.

Today the Independent Police Complaints Commission confirmed Mrs Barnes' office had referred the investigation to it two weeks ago. 

If Mrs Barnes was found guilty of a charge of driving without insurance, she could be fined £300 and hit with six penalty points on her licence.

A statement by the watchdog said: 'Details of the accident in Princes Road, Dartford, on 16 September, were referred to the IPCC by the office of the Police and Crime Commissioner for Kent on 26 September.

'Following an assessment it has been decided that an independent IPCC investigation is necessary to determine whether Ann Barnes may have committed a criminal offence.

'The investigation will be overseen by IPCC Commissioner Cindy Butts.'

An IPCC spokesman told MailOnline it had taken over the probe because Mrs Barnes could not be investigated by her own police force.

He said: 'Any potential criminal matters involving PCCs or their deputies have to be referred to the IPCC, and in most circumstances we investigate'.

He could not give an indication of how long the investigation would take. 

Police forces often bring prosecutions for driving without insurance after making a check on a national database which takes only a few minutes to complete. 

A spokesman for Mrs Barnes said neither she nor her office would be making any comment. She added: 'It's an IPCC investigation.'

The crash happened on the outskirts of Dartford while Mrs Barnes was driving to a meeting.

Controversy: Mrs Barnes also came under fire for hiring Paris Brown as her youth crime commissioner shortly after being elected for the job. The 17-year-old stepped down after posting offensive remarks on Twitter

On what her 'Crime Onion' meant: 'Oh God, I've got no idea - I can't tell you actually - I wasn't thinking I'd be talking about the actual onion (the concentric circles) as we call it - umm I don't know know really - everything's important.'

On her job: 'Oh dear, what is a police commissioner? Right, well it's not the Police Commissioner, it's the Police and Crime Commissioner.

'It's a strange job because there is actually no description at all - there are certain responsibilities you have to do, but there is no actual job description.'

On her Ann Force One battle bus: 'My budget is £317million, £15,000 is money well spent - I could have had a top of range Mercedes, but it's not my image.'

She suffered minor injuries and tweeted: 'Hit an unforgiving tree! Shaken, sore and bruised, but thankfully OK.’

Mrs Barnes, who travels around in a 'battle bus' dubbed Ann Force One, has faced a string of controversies since she was elected to her post as a political independent in 2012.

She came under fire after she appointed Paris Brown, then aged 17, as Britain's first youth crime commissioner.

Miss Brown later resigned from the £15,000-a-year job after making offensive comments on her Twitter feed which were revealed by The Mail on Sunday.

The former teacher then apologised this summer after taking part in a Channel 4 fly-on-the-wall documentary which rank-and-file officers said had made her a 'laughing stock'. 

In Meet the Commissioner - which led Twitter users to compare her to the gaffe-prone comedy characters David Brent and Alan Partridge - she struggled to explain what her role involved, failed to write her title correctly on a whiteboard and was filmed painting her 'flaky' nails.

She also said in the hour-long programme that driving a Mercedes was not her 'image' - and she was then filmed in the next shot arriving at work in a Mercedes.

Pressure on Mrs Barnes later intensified when it emerged her second youth crime tsar, Kerry Boyd, faced allegations of a relationship with a married former councillor.

Former London 2012 torchbearer Miss Boyd, 20, replaced Miss Brown - but stepped away from making public engagements when reports of the relationship surfaced. The former councillor involved later said the pair had been 'good friends'.

A former head of the Kent Police Authority, Mrs Barnes won a landslide 47 per cent of the vote in the 2012, smashing second-placed Conservative candidate Craig Mackinlay who won 25 per cent.

But the turnout was just 16 per cent, a figure echoed across Britain.

The low numbers and subsequent gaffes have led critics to accuse the policy of police commissioners, which aimed to hold forces better to account, of being a white elephant.
