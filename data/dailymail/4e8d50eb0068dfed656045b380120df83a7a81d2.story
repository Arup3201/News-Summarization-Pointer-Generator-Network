Novelist Sir Terry Pratchett has accused the Government of ‘pussy footing’ around on dementia treatment and withholding vital research funds.

In a damning blog, the top-selling author - who was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in 2007 - said care services were left to ‘paper over the cracks’ of a lack of funds.

Sir Terry wrote a personal reflection on society’s response to the disease alongside his own experiences in the inaugural article for the Alzheimer’s Research UK.

Sir Terry Pratchett, 65, has accused the Government of 'pussy footing' around on dementia treatment and withholding vital research funds. Sir Terry was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2007

He called for more investment into research and said science needed to deliver on its promises.

The 65-year-old said: ‘Technology and a trained and compassionate care system can help paper over the cracks, but, a decade since the last proclaimed development, science needs to deliver on its promises.

'There’s more money floating around the Government for research, but barely enough to buy a middling Premier League striker.

‘If we’re serious about this thing, and want to match the fanfare with the funding, then more money needs to be found down the back of David Cameron’s sofa.’

The author, famous for his Discworld fantasy books, added: ‘If there is indeed an emerging sense - finally - that we’ve stopped pussy footing around dementia and can now bear to utter its name, we nevertheless find a cloud of unknowing persists.

‘People read, watch and hear more about it than ever before. They know it’s out there.

Sir Terry said 'If we're serious about this thing, and want to match the fanfare with the funding, then more money needs to be found down the back of David Cameron's sofa'

‘They know it will claim more of us as we continue to age. They fear it.

‘Dementia
vies with cancer in an unsavoury battle of the scariest, but it must be
said that some lucky people will survive cancer.

‘But I suspect many still don’t understand dementia or, at least, understand it only as an insidious memory loss. The fear, perhaps, is a fear of the unknown.

‘There isn’t one kind of dementia. There aren’t a dozen kinds. There are hundreds of thousands.

‘Each person who lives with one of these diseases will be affected in uniquely destructive ways.

‘I, for one, am the only person suffering from Terry Pratchett’s posterior cortical atrophy which, for some unknown reason, still leaves me able to write - with the help of my computer and friend - bestselling novels.’

Sir Terry became a patron of Alzheimer’s Research UK in 2008, shortly after announcing his diagnosis with posterior cortical atrophy, a rare variant of Alzheimer’s disease primarily affecting vision.

He went on to make a personal donation of $1 million to the charity, and has subsequently campaigned for greater research funding, including delivering a major petition to Number 10 and countless media appearances.

The charity’s blog, www.dementiablog.org, aims to share the ideas and experiences of people living with dementia.

It also hopes to bring news on scientists working to improve diagnosis, prevention and treatment, and the fundraisers who support the UK’s leading dementia research charity.

In a closing statement Sir Terry, from Salisbury, Wiltshire, said: ‘The funding drum will continue to be beaten no doubt.

‘In the meantime, donors to this charity and all of us as tax payers put faith in the scientists working their arcane magic with limited means.

‘We need to know that they are beating the odds, and this should be the place to come to find out.

‘Believe me, I for one, will be looking over their shoulders and taking them to task. Come on, get on with it!’

There are hundreds of thousands of people in the UK living with dementia, and more than 40 per cent of the UK population know someone close with the disease.

Alzheimer’s Research UK funds more than £20 million of dementia research across the UK - including more than £1 million in the South West - and is a leading commentator on new dementia research findings.

A new brain scan which could be used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease has been hailed by experts.

There are currently no fail-safe methods to test for the illness which affects around 500,000 people in Britain.

But researchers in Japan have developed a scan which could eventually help doctors accurately diagnose the disease.

The technology allows them to detect a protein called tau which builds up in the brains of people with Alzheimer's.

Dr Eric Karran, director of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: 'This promising early study highlights a potential new method for detecting tau - a key player in both Alzheimer's and frontotemporal dementia - in the living brain.

'With new drugs in development designed to target tau, scans capable of visualising the protein inside the brain could be important for assessing whether treatments in clinical trials are hitting their target.

'If this method is shown to be effective, such a scan could also be a useful aid for providing people with an accurate diagnosis, as well as for monitoring disease progression.

'Larger and more long-term studies are needed to confirm these findings and investigate how well these scans can track the build-up of tau over time.'

He added: 'For results like these to be translated into a tool that would be suitable for widespread use, investment in research is crucial.

'The different forms of dementia can be extremely difficult to diagnose accurately using currently available methods, and research to improve these methods is important if we are to help people access the right care and treatments.'

Sir Terry complains about lack of research but he ignores the research that has already been published. It is known that Alzheimer's is mainly caused by toxic metals, autopsies prove this. It is also known that the brains of Alzheimer's patients lack a fat called  Medium Chain Triglycerides. If people with Alzheimer's were to de-tox their brain of the toxic metals, and supplement their diet with  Medium Chain Triglycerides, their Alzheimer's would go away. More details can be found in the book - "Toxic Metal Syndrome: How Metal Poisoning Can Affect Your Brain", - by H.Richard Casdorph and Morton Walker.

Don't tell me you can't afford your own treatment terry, you have made millions from your writing career, do you live in a fantasy world ?

Sir Terry is absolutely right, the government is great at bragging about what they'll do, but useless as putting their money where their mouth is. At least he has donated a million - bet the Tories won't do the same ever.
