It appears that a double life sentence isn't enough to cow 85-year-old mobster James 'Whitey' Bulger.

The Boston gangster allegedly had an improper relationship last year with a female psychologist at the maximum security prison in Tucson, Arizona where he was being held - resulting in him being swiftly transferred to a Florida facility  and the woman being suspended from her job.

An investigation is reportedly underway into allegations from last summer that Bulger provided the counselor, who is in her thirties, with autographed mugshots.

In return, she reportedly got him moved to his own cell and lobbied to allow him to write to his jail-bird girlfriend, Catherine Greig,The Boston Globe reported on Sunday. 

James 'Whitey' Bulger (pictured in 2011) was suddenly moved to a prison in Florida last summer, reportedly because he was having an improper relationship with a prison psychologist who managed to get him privileges such as writing to his girlfriend (and fellow prisoner) Catherine Greig

Grieg is currently jailed at a minimum-security facility in Waseca, Minnesota for harboring a fugitive and is due to be released in 2018.

In 2013, Bulger was convicted and sentenced on racketeering charges that tied him to 11 murders and other gangland crimes from the 1970s and 1980s.

The Globe reported that Bulger had become something of a celebrity on arrival at the Arizona prison in January 2014. He had posed for photographs inside the prison and reportedly loved to tell stories about his violent past. 

A portrait of Bulger as a young man, with his inmate number during his time at Alcatraz, has even been posted to eBay reportedly signed by the notorious gangster and the artist, Josh Pietrantonio.

A source close to Mr Pietrantonio told Daily Mail Online on Monday that Bulger had signed a few pieces for the artist and the pair had become good friends - 'one of his only friends' -  at the federal prison.   

During his time in Tucson, it also appears as if Bulger turned his charms on the prison psychologist, who has not been identified.

A Justice Department investigation has been launched, according to the Boston Globe, with agents questioning Bulger and the counselor about their relationship.

Daily Mail Online was awaiting a comment from the Justice Department on Monday. 

Investigators were reportedly trying to find out if the prison counselor lobbied to get him placed in his own cell and have the prison warden sign off on Bulger being allowed to write to Grieg. 

A portrait of a young James Bulger (with his Alcatraz number and his signature) currently has a bid of $595 on eBay and was allegedly painted by a former inmate. A prison psychologist is also reportedly under investigation for taking autographed mugshots of the notorious crime boss

The investigation is also looking into whether the psychologist tried to make money selling autographed pictures of Bulger, whose life story has been the subject of numerous books, documentaries and an upcoming movie starring Johnny Depp. 

The female employee has denied doing anything illegal. She was barred from the prison, according to The Globe, but is still on the payroll.

It was unclear whether she will be criminally charged or be disciplined by her employer. 

Bulger was moved to Florida in early September last year. His attorney Hank Brennan said at the time that he hadn’t been told why Bulger was moved. 

For policy reasons, U.S. Penitentiary Tuscon were unable to comment on the reported investigation and could not comment on Bulger's transfer for security reasons. 

Bulger is currently serving his sentence at Coleman II, a high-security penitentiary in Sumterville, Florida. 

Bulger fled Boston shortly before his 1995 indictment after being tipped off by a former FBI agent. He was one of the FBI's most wanted fugitives for 16 years until his 2011 arrest in Santa Monica, California.  

Bulger's case ultimately became a black eye for the FBI and the basis for recent Hollywood movies after it was revealed that corrupt federal agents had accepted bribes and protected him over the years. 

Following a 35-day trial, a federal jury  found Bulger guilty of 31 of 32 counts in August 2013, including racketeering, money laundering, extortion and firearms violations.

The jury also found prosecutors had proved Bulger participated in 11 of the 19 murders of which he was accused. Bulger was sentenced in November 2013. 

USP Tucson would not confirm on Monday if they were being investigated by the Justice Department following a female counselor's relationship with Whitey Bulger
