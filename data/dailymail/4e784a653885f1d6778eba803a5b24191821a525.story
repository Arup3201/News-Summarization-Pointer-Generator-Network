New Labour's 24-hour drinking laws have left Britain 'awash' with cheap alcohol and plagued by late night violence, experts warned last night.

Home Office figures reveal there are now a record number of trouble hotspots – with 208 neighbourhoods officially classified as being 'saturated' with problem pubs or bars.

To the fury of medical experts, there is also a record number of supermarkets, petrol stations and convenience stores selling booze around the clock – fuelling harmful drinking.

New Labour's 24-hour drinking laws, introduced in 2005, has left Britain 'awash' with cheap alcohol 

The scale of Britain's drinking culture is laid bare by the Home Office's annual report on alcohol and late night refreshment licensing, slipped out shortly before Christmas

Adding to the misery inflicted on residents, the number of late night takeaway shops servicing the bars and off-licences has hit an all-time high of 87,000.

The Tories had pledged to end the chaos caused by New Labour's licensing reforms, which occurred in 2005 in the face of fierce opposition from police and GPs, as well as a Daily Mail campaign.

But the powers they gave town halls to limit opening hours in problem areas and make bars and clubs pay for extra policing have proved a spectacular flop.

By the end of March this year, only one so-called late night levy had been introduced and there was not a single order to restrict early morning alcohol sales.

Last night council leaders demanded a change to the rules – labelling the current powers 'unwieldy, bureaucratic, and extremely costly and time-consuming'. 

Health campaigners said one of the most devastating consequences of 24-hour drinking laws has been shops selling cheap alcohol all day and night.

Of the 7,353 licences in force for round-the-clock opening, more than a quarter (2,065) were for supermarkets and convenience stores.

Chief constables have since declared 24-hour drinking a failed 'experiment' which did not usher in the promised 'café culture'

The total number of premises licensed to sell alcohol is stable at 204,300, as is the overall number of 24-hour drinking licences, which stands at 8,200

Liver specialist Professor Sir Ian Gilmore, chairman of the Alcohol Health Alliance, said: 'We are awash with outlets selling cheap drink. I don't think actually the general public is in favour of this and I don't think they know what to do about it. It beggars belief you can buy a bottle of wine at a garage at 2am.

'The whole direction of policy is in deregulation, to make alcohol an ordinary product just like soap powder rather than realising it is a drug of dependence. The problem is supermarkets, convenience stores and petrol stations selling cheap drink.'

The scale of Britain's drinking culture is laid bare by the Home Office's annual report on alcohol and late night refreshment licensing, slipped out shortly before Christmas. 

The total number of premises licensed to sell alcohol is stable at 204,300, as is the overall number of 24-hour drinking licences, which stands at 8,200.

But the number of supermarkets and shops which never close is up by 5 per cent. 

There has also been an alarming 19 per cent spike in the amount of so-called cumulative impact zones – up from 175 a year ago. This means a town centre or neighbourhood is officially considered to be a trouble hotspot which is at 'saturation' point and cannot cope with new premises opening.

Trouble in these areas ranges from fighting and litter to drug dealing, pick-pocketing and robbery. Many are now found in small, previously quiet towns which used to have few crimes of this nature.

At the end of March 2007, when the licensing laws had been relaxed for just over a year, there were only 71 of these zones in the UK.

Upon coming to office, the Conservatives promised to limit the worst impact of the change in the law with two new powers: late night levies which would see late-opening problem venues pay more for their licence, and early morning alcohol restriction orders, or EMROs. EMROs enable town halls to prohibit the sale of alcohol for a specified time period between midnight and 6am in the whole or part of their area. 

Yet, despite being launched amid great fanfare, there was not a single EMRO in force at the end of March this year. 

And at the end of that month there was just a single late night levy, which raised £300,000 from pub and bar owners in Newcastle; a city notorious for drunken late night scenes.

Cllr Ann Lucas, chairman of the Local Government Association's Safer and Stronger Communities Board, said: 'Councils are being hamstrung by the current systems for implementing early morning restriction orders and late night levies, which are unwieldy, bureaucratic, and extremely costly and time-consuming.

'Local authorities are forced to hold numerous hearings, and call scores of witnesses as a result of multiple representations by the alcohol industry. However, residents – who do not have access to expensive lawyers – struggle to be heard because of the number and complexity of forms they must fill out.

'Late night levies must be introduced across councils' entire areas, which makes it extremely difficult to target them effectively.'

The Daily Mail – backed by senior police, ambulance staff and judges – opposed the 2005 relaxation of the licensing laws. Chief constables have since declared 24-hour drinking a failed 'experiment' which did not usher in the promised 'café culture'.

Last year, the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) said the situation was so bad that private sector-run 'drunk tanks' should be introduced to care for the inebriated.

Last night, Labour's shadow home office spokesman Diana Johnson said: 'Theresa May's record on alcohol is one of broken promises and failed policies.'

Crime Prevention Minister Lynne Featherstone said: 'The Government is taking a range of action to address the £11billion a year that alcohol-fuelled crime and disorder costs England and Wales.

'We have given local areas more powers to deal with alcohol-related disorder, and I have recently written to local authorities and police and crime commissioners to remind them of these important measures.

'We have also lowered the evidence threshold for decision-making to make it easier for licensing authorities and the police to review, revoke or impose conditions on licences.

'Seven local authority areas have now decided to introduce a [late night] levy.'
