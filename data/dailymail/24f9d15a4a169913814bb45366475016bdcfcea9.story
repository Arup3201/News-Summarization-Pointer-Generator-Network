Attack: Tahmoor Hussain, now 21, from Nelson, Lancashire has been jailed for 32 months for sexually assaulting a 28-year-old woman after a night out on New Year's Eve

A 19-year-old sex attacker answered his mobile phone while molesting a terrified woman and casually told the caller he would ring back in 15 minutes, a court heard.

Tahmoor Hussain, now 21, had just pushed his 28-year old victim to the ground before getting on top of her, kissing her, biting her lip and threatening to kill her.

As the woman lay struggling on a grass verge, Hussain's mobile rang and he answered it, Burnley Crown Court heard.

After hanging up, Hussain grabbed his victim again and tried to frogmarch her away. She only escaped when he began to return the call.

The court heard the horrific attack took place on New Year's Eve 2010 after the victim had been out with a friend in Burnley.

She was heading home alone at about 
7pm when she saw Hussain,  of Nelson, Lancashire, staggering and 
weaving around on the pavement.

As she passed him he told her she had a 'nice bottom' and asked her if she was on her own. She turned round, gestured towards him and ran off.

Amanda Johnson, prosecuting, said Hussain then approached the victim and asked for her telephone number.

Miss Johnson said: 'She said she didn’t have one but he put out his hand to stop her walking past. He asked again for her number and suddenly began to kiss her.

'The defendant moved towards the woman, she moved back and he pushed her to the ground. He then got on top of her, held her down, kissed her, said he was going to kill her, repeated he would kill her, kissed her again and bit her lip.

'He asked her to go home with him, the victim was so scared she said "yes", and the defendant kissed her and bit her lip once again. He continued to kiss her and then put his hand inside her knickers and committed a sex act.

Location: The victim had been walking near Gannow Top when Hussain pounced

Judgement: Before sentencing Hussain at Burnley Crown Court, Judge Beverley Lunt said the victim would 'be haunted by what happened for a long time'

Miss Johnson added the woman was still lying on the ground, frightened.

'The
 defendant told the woman, "Get up, you’re going home," pulled her to 
her feet and the victim said she was not going with him and started to 
scream,' Miss Johnson said.

'The
 defendant dared her to call 999 and offered her his phone. She ran away
 and he pursued her, chasing her through the underpass. The victim got 
50 metres and could not run any further.'

The prosecutor said the defendant told the woman he loved her, she screamed for him to leave her alone, he grabbed her, she pushed him away and she fled when he began to make a phone call.

Horror: Judge Lunt made reference to the act being out of character for Hussain but said it could not diminish the 'full horror of the experience for your victim'

The woman, who did not contact police immediately but told a friend and indicated she was scared, picked Hussain out of a video identity parade.

Hussain's mobile phone records put him at the location of the assault on that day. CCTV footage from the underpass was analysed and compared with the defendant. Twelve points of similarity on his body were found.

When he was questioned by police, Hussain claimed he had been in Nelson at the time, didn’t provide the code for his mobile phone and refused to answer any more questions.

Defending, Michael Murray, said Hussain had been 'intoxicated to a very high level.'

'This awful offence was out of character for him and there are no signs that it will ever be repeated in the future. He can’t, of course, say that nothing will ever happen, but there are no signs that it will.'

But sentencing, Judge Beverley Lunt said the incident was obviously terrifying for the victim and involved a level of violence.

'The complainant must have suffered some psychological trauma and would be haunted by what happened for a long time,' she added.

'This was not a minor sexual assault. It was a serious sexual assault. You have little or no memory of it because you were so drunk. Your victim was not that fortunate.'

Judge Lunt said Hussain had been very, very drunk and his conduct was clearly out of character for him. But added: 'None of that can possibly, possibly, diminish the full horror of the experience for your victim.'

Hussain admitted assault by penetration and was jailed for 32 months. He was put on the sex offenders' register indefinitely.
