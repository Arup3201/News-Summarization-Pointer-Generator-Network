Kermit the Frog has been given the star treatment in these hilarious pictures of the Muppet  as characters from some of Hollywood's most iconic films - including Christmas classic Home Alone.

Blogger Matthew McCrory, 27, from Belfast gave a froggy twist to classic posters and scenes as part of a 'Photo a Day in May' tumblr project.

Lying down and covered in rose petals Ameri-Kerm Beauty is an ode to the iconic Sam Mendes film while Kermit's creepy side comes out as the masked Hannibal Lecter in Silence of the Amphibians.

Blogger Matthew McCrory has given a twist to classic film posters and scenes: Kermit is covered in rose petals  in a scene from American Beauty, now named AmeriKerm Beauty, while on the right he makes a horrorshow Alex in A Clockwork Orange remake, A Frogwork Orange

And mimicking Macaulay Culkin's shocked pose from the film poster he's the perfect fit for Kerm Alone and with an 80s quiff and smarmy grin he could be an extra in AnKerman.

Perched in the front of Mr McCrory's niece's bike basket Kermit is ET and to round off the series he's posed up as the MGM Lion.

Matthew started the project as a way to fill his time while recuperating from a bone marrow transplant as treatment for leukaemia.

He said: 'Kermit's a really cool character. He's funny, and considering he's a frog, he's quite the gentleman.

'He's just a little tadpole from the swamp that made it in the big city.

'When I was thinking about inspiration for my photo a day project he was just there and I knew he would be a great subject for photos.

'I've always found the idea of doing a photo a day really interesting. As a creative side project it's something that's always appealed to me.

'And post-transplant it was particularly important for me to have something to work on - something fun and frivolous to concentrate on rather than just going to appointments.

'This was perfect because I haven't been able to spend too much time outside because of the risk of infection.

'I bought him a few years ago after I'd been to a couple of job interviews where they'd asked who I'd invite to my ideal dinner party and Kermit was always my choice.

'He has personality traits that I'd like to emulate, though I'm not sure what that says about me.

'It's really cool that even though his face is locked in an expression he looks really different depending on how he's posed and dressed.

'And I love a good fog-based pun.

'They were coming to me at the weirdest times. I'd wake up in the middle of the night and think of one so that's what I'd do the next day.'
