Modern mums are often portrayed as being irrational for stopping their children playing with dirt.

But the plight of Paralympian skier and flag-bearer Millie Knight shows there are real reasons to be wary.

The 15-year-old was blinded in one eye by an infection known as toxocara, which is contracted from contaminated soil.

What is toxocara?

Toxocara are essentially dog worms, whose eggs are passed out in the dog’s faeces. Accidental ingestion causes humans to be infected.

Children playing in parks are most at risk, as soil may be contaminated by passing canines. Toddlers putting their hands in their mouth after playing in dirt or eating soil are another at-risk group.

Toxocara is contracted from soil contaminated by dog faeces and can cause blindness

How many people are affected by toxocara in the UK?

Studies have shown that up  to three per cent of the UK population have antibodies to the parasite, which means they have ingested it at some point.

But it is usually symptom-less and causes no problems for most people.

How does toxocara  cause blindness?

Once ingested, the eggs hatch in the intestine and the parasite larvae cross the gut wall into the bloodstream.

This allows them to travel to organs including the liver, heart, brain and eyes.

The larvae don’t develop at these sites, but in rare cases local inflammation in reaction to them causes the disease toxocariasis.

In the eye, it can cause blindness, as happened to Millie.

How can I prevent my  child getting toxocara?

Handwashing after being in the park, and before eating, are essential, as is washing all raw vegetables before eating.
