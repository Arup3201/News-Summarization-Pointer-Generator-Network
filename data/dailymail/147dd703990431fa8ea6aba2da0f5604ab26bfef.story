The personal assistant who first found the body of Robin Williams on Monday morning at his California mansion has been revealed to be his close friend Rebecca Erwin Spencer.

The 57-year-old who worked with the Oscar winner for years made the harrowing discovery when she entered his bedroom after he failed to respond to knocks on the door according to Radar Online.

Having worked with Williams for at least 20-years, Rebecca was trusted by the sometimes manic comedian to keep him grounded, in particular keeping his ego in check by addressing him with the pet name, 'Mork Guy', in reference to his breakthrough role in Mork and Mindy.

Rebecca, who became so close to the comic genius that she moved houses to be near to him, was seen entering Williams' Tiburon home at around 11am on Tuesday following his tragic suicide and that morning posted pictures of herself and the actor to Facebook, to which friends added messages of support.

One long term friend of Robin and Rebecca revealed to MailOnline the level of dedication that the Good Will Hunting star's assistant had towards her employer.

The friend, who did not want to be identified said, 'Rebecca was incredibly close to Robin. She used to live In San Fransisco, but when Robin moved out to Tiburon, she moved to a place about five minutes away.'

Rebecca, who worked as Williams' assistant on more than 33 films, including his Oscar triumph for Good Will Hunting, was praised by the comic when he accepted the Cecil B. DeMille lifetime achievement award from the Golden Globes in 2005.

In a typically irreverent speech, Williams thanked the Foreign Press Association for honoring his work as a comedian, paid tribute to his family and credited Rebecca with keeping his ego in check by calling him 'Hey, Mork Guy'.

In another sign of the closeness between the star and his employee, one of Rebecca's neighbors claimed the Oscar winner actually bought her and her husband Dan their new house in Tiburon, although that is unconfirmed.

Whimsical: Rebecca Erwin Spencer was known amongst her friends for her devotion to Robin Williams and even moved to be near to the legendary comic so that she could give him her full attention

The neighbor explained: 'Both her and Dan were completely dedicated to Robin, it really was like they were part of the family.

'When we heard his personal assistant had found him, we assumed it must have been either Rebecca or Dan.

'And then when it came out that it was a woman, we knew it had to be Rebecca. It would have been so horrendous for her, it will stay with her forever.

'She used to spend so much of her time with Robin. She traveled everywhere with him and was always round at his house.

'They used to dog sit for him as well. Whenever you saw them walking their dogs and they had a little pug with them, that was Robin's.

'He sometimes used to come round and they would have little events in the back garden. We always used to joke with them that they never invited us.

'They are a lovely couple, but they are quite shy and quiet, so they didn't make a big deal of their relationship with Robin.

'This will be absolutely awful for them. I just can't imagine how they are feeling.'

On Tuesday morning, Rebecca, who first worked with Robin on his 1993 hit, Mrs. Doubtfire, uploaded a picture of Robin Williams performing for the troops on one of his USO tours and added the message, 'What a time we had!'.

One friend, Aunti Kr replied, 'You were the wind beneath his wings.'

Another friend on Facebook, Tom Reilly wrote, 'You were an amazing team. Truly.'

Louis Spotswood commented, 'Rebecca...you gave him so much that was great in his life. You did the best he could have asked for!'

Williams had been open about his struggles with alcohol and cocaine and in the past months had entered a rehabilitation center to help him maintain sobriety. But many questions remained over what could have led him to take his own life.

Williams' publicist, Mara Buxbaum, said on Monday that he had been suffering from severe depression, and Boyd acknowledged that he had been seeking treatment without giving more details.

Williams was last seen alive by his wife, Susan Schneider, on Sunday night when she retired for the evening. She left the next morning around 10 a.m., thinking that her husband was still asleep.
