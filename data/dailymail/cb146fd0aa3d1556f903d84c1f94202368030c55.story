The campaigner who helped expose the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal has been victimised by hate mail after being given a CBE.

Julie Bailey set up the group Cure The NHS after her mother died from horrific care on the wards and pushed politicians to hold a public inquiry into the failings, which led to announcement that the hospital trust would be dissolved.

This year she was forced to move out of her home in Stafford and close down her café after receiving death threats and abuse from local residents and hospital staff.

Hurt: Julie Bailey out campaigning against poor care in Mid-Staffordshire NHS Trust. She has been victimised by hate mail, with some examples shown right, since being awarded a CBE in the New Year honours list

After she was named in the Queen’s New Year’s honours list yesterday, many of these individuals, including local councillors and nurses, took to the internet to vent their rage.

One message, written by Andy Sutherland, describes her as a ‘lying b****.

Writing on Facebook he added: ‘Lets get our fingers out and show the Tory’s [sic] what we think of them. Lying gits giving rewards to other lying gits.’

Nurse whistleblower Helene Donnelly – who helped expose appalling care in the trusts A&E department – was also given an OBE in the honours.

But a message written by Mick Terry, who was born in Stafford, describes her and Miss Bailey as a ‘pair of s****’.

And Christine Baron, an independent councillor on Stafford Borough Council, wrote: ‘Insult to: doctors and nurses everywhere who work diligently for their patients’.

Miss Baron, who was on the council’s health scrutiny committee, which overlooked the failings at the trust, yesterday described the honour as ‘a complete insult’.

The widowed mother-of-two said: ‘It is a disgrace that she had been honoured like this and shows that the system is a shambles.

‘We should all be embarrassed that this has happened, she has caused nothing but trouble with what she has done.’

NHS officials last month announced that Mid 
Staffordshire trust would be dissolved and Stafford and Cannock 
hospitals closed after concluding it didn't have enough cash to ensure
 patients could be guaranteed safe care

Last month NHS officials announced that 
Mid Staffordshire trust would be dissolved after concluding it did not 
have enough money to ensure patients could be guaranteed safe care.

A number of key departments at its two hospitals Stafford and Cannock will be taken over by neighbouring trusts and dozens of jobs are expected to go.

Yesterday Miss Bailey, who also spoke out against Sir David Nicholson, the outgoing head of the NHS  dubbed ‘the man with no shame’ after he stayed in his job after being implicated in the Mid Staffs scandal, said she was ‘hurt’ by the messages but unsurprised.

She added: ‘But I know there is so much support. But I know the NHS is a safer place and its going to get much safer.’
