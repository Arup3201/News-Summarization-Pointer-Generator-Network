With a fashion designer mother and a sartorially astute footballer father, it's no wonder Romeo Beckham has picked up a few style tips along the way.

Now the stylish 12-year-old  has made his debut in the prestigious best-dressed men list - 21 places above his father.

Sought-after Romeo, who recently modelled for Burberry for a reputed £45,000 fee, was ranked at 25th in the GQ magazine best-dressed list, outshining his famous father who only managed 46th.

It came as Prince George made his debut at number 49, just months after posing in a stylish knitted jumper for an official Christmas shoot at Kensington Palace.

His grandfather, the Prince Of Wales, was placed at number seven. 

But the spotlight was stolen by the dapper Theory of Everything actor Eddie Redmayne, who beat Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch to the top spot.

In third place was Jamie Dornan, the star of the upcoming Fifty Shades of Grey film.

Meanwhile, Newsnight presenter Evan Davies, who took over from Jeremy Paxman earlier this year, was named as the worst dressed for apparently resembling 'a supply geography teacher'.

His BBC colleague, world affairs editor John Simpson, was named as one of the best-dressed, in 32nd place.

The critics said he was 'the only reporter who consistently sports a well-pressed shirt under his flak jacket'. 

A surprise entry this year was footballer Wayne Rooney who was praised for swapping shell suits for a 'sharp' wardrobe and was put in 26th place. 

What a cutie! Prince George debuted in the list at number 49, following this official Christmas image taken in a courtyard in Kensington Palace in November
