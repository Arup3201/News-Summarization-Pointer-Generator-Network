For 50 years, Harry Redknapp has been one of football’s most colourful and outspoken characters. Now he’s written a book every fan will want to read.  

In Redknapp’s new book 'A Man Walks On To a Pitch' – serialised exclusively by Sportsmail this week - the QPR manager tells a tale of Roy Keane and Patrick Vieira's rivalry.

Gareth Southgate tells a story about those two warriors Roy Keane and Patrick Vieira.

Roy had just started his career as a pundit with ITV and was covering a Manchester City match away in Europe.

The presenter told Roy there was a special guest coming to see them - someone he might remember from his playing days.

With that, Gareth could see Patrick Vieira walking towards them, in his new role as a Manchester City ambassador.

Gareth says the change in Keane’s demeanour was terrifying: his mood darkened, his eyes narrowed, he stiffened and his grip on the table was almost white-knuckle.

Nearly 10 years after they had last played each other, Roy had gone into battle mode.

The duo's animosity before that Premier League match was a running theme throughout their battles

Sportsmail's Head of Sport Lee Clayton interviews Redknapp about his new book  

Gareth said it was like being transported back into that tunnel at Highbury in February 2005. Patrick was completely unsuspecting, approaching the table with a big smile on his face.

It looked as if it could backfire horribly, but the first words out of Patrick’s mouth were so complimentary towards Roy it just defused the situation.

It shows you how much it means to the very top players. Even all those years later.
