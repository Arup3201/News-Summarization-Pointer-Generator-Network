She's openly admitted to enjoying a spot of Botox but Katie Price maintains that apart from that, she's 'all natural' - and doesn't even wear make-up.

Speaking to MailOnline, the 36-year-old said: 'I've had Botox, everyone knows that, but I'm natural. I've never been one to wear make-up.'

The pregnant star, who has just been unveiled as the new face of hair
 dye removal product ColourB4, added: 'You don't need surgery to make yourself look younger, just change your hair colour.'

New face: Katie Price has been unveiled as the ambassador for ColourB4, a hair dye removal product, so FEMAIL caught up with her about all things health and beauty

Katie believes that dyeing your hair can 'take years off you' and thinks the lighter, the better.

The star claims that she's thrown herself into her latest role as ambassador for the product, that claims to work by reversing the colouring process, shrinking the colour molecules along with any toxins trapped inside the hair.

'I've done my homework on this product and I know it works,' she said.

The model and entrepreneur explained that she can't wait to change her hair colour after giving birth to her baby.

Speaking proudly about her hair, she said: 'I've got a good set of hair, it's thick and in good condition. After I've had the baby I will change my colour, maybe go blonder for the summer. I can't wait. Me being me, I'll probably go too blonde though.'

The soon-to-be mother-of-five also revealed that she's been lucky enough not to get stretch marks during her pregnancy.

'If you look at pictures of my baby bump on the internet, you'll see I've got no stretch marks,' she said.

Despite
 her body and hair confidence, Katie recently revealed she is 
feeling insecure in her pregnancy as she has gained four stone in two 
months.

The future is looking bright for the nation's favourite former glamour 
girl, who already has a lucrative book deal, perfume, lingerie line, 
haircare range and equestrian collection under her blingy belt.

She
 said: 'I have lots of exciting plans and I am going to focus on being a
 businesswoman. I've written the next four chapters of my autobiography 
this week.

'I'm not in a rush though and I just want to enjoy being a mum and doing things that I want to do. Things are going to be hectic after the baby but I'm all good,' she said.
