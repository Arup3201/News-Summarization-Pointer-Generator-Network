A school bus driver who crushed a six-year-old boy to death when his vehicle sped out of control was jailed for 28 months today.

Adrian Shearing pressed the accelerator instead of the brakes on the 67-seat DAF coach as Nicola Connor dropped off her son, Finlay, at school.

They both became trapped between the bus and a Fiat Punto outside the gates of Woodborough School in Pewsey, Wiltshire, when the tragic accident happened.

Mrs Connor was then dragged under the 
coach for 30 metres until Shearing, 52, managed to stop.

She suffered
'massive injuries' to her legs, pelvis and body but Finlay never 
regained consciousness, Winchester Crown Court was told.

During the hearing Mrs Connor and Finlay's father Greg 
sat in the well of the court during the hearing and wept as the court 
was told of the events.

Adrian Shearing, arriving in court today, was visibly shaken after the accident

Afterwards the family issued a 
statement: 'Finlay Joseph Connor was simply the most perfect son to us 
as parents and a wonderful big brother to Louis.

'From the moment he was born he has 
brought us all love and joy, he really was a shining star who lit up our
lives each and every day.

'On March 14 Finlay walked hand in 
hand to school with his mummy, as we did each and every day, so full, as
always, of excitement for the school day ahead.

'This is my last memory of Finlay, as within just moments of reaching the school gate, the school coach accelerated towards us, running us down.

'In that moment our little boy's wonderful life was ended and his family's lives destroyed.

'Now nearly seven months on, we struggle to live our lives without him. He was so adored and is so missed.'

Shearing had only driven the coach 
owned by Bodman And Sons once before and was a part-time driver who had 
been employed for six months by the company to drop pupils off at 
various schools.

Shearing, from Trowbridge, pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving.

Moments before colliding with Finlay and Mrs Connor, a tractor had scraped the side of the coach.

He was described as 'annoyed but not 
angry' before getting back into the bus. In the meantime, the narrow 
road outside the school had become blocked with a second tractor wanting
to get through.

Finlay's parents, Greg and Nicola, sobbed as they heard details of their son's death on March 14

Parents had parked further away and were walking in the middle of the road to get to the school gates.

Colin Meeke, prosecuting, said: 'The 
second tractor driver, Ryan Lanfear, described hearing the bus rev hard 
three times and then continuously.

'He could not believe the speed that 
the bus took off past him. There are quite a number of witnesses who 
describe the high revs and shooting off at some speed.'

The barrister said the Fiat was in front of the bus as it sped off.

'In a ghastly coincidence Mrs Nicola 
Connor was leading her son by the hand behind the Fiat just as the coach
careered forward into it.

'Both were struck down. Finlay Connor received fatal injuries and did not regain consciousness.

'Mrs Connor suffered massive injuries.
There was nothing whatsoever she could have done. She suffers 
survivors' guilt but there was nothing anyone could have done.'

A visibly shaken Shearing was heard to say after the death that the brakes had failed on the coach.

But the court heard it had no defects 
and that Shearing had suffered sudden acceleration syndrome, a common 
cause of similar accidents involving automatic buses where the driver 
becomes confused when he presses the accelerator by mistake and not the 
brake and cannot understand why the vehicle will not stop.

In mitigation, the court heard 
Shearing was an ordinary hard-working family man with no previous 
convictions. He accepted the coach was out of control, and gave his 
heartfelt sympathy to the family.

'It was his error that caused the 
accident. He panicked and slammed his foot down on the accelerator,' his
barrister Michael Hall said.

Imposing the prison term and a 
three-year driving disqualification, Judge Guy Boney QC accepted 
Shearing's culpability in the death was low, but he said: 'The 
consequences of your driving come very high. A life has been lost at the
very outset of its course and you ultimately bear the responsibility.'
