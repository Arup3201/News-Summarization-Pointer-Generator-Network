A whistleblower sacked as he tried to publicise the success of a new cancer wonder drug has been awarded £3.4million for unfair dismissal.

David Best, 63, was chairman and managing director of a medical research company which developed a vaccine against prostate cancer, which in trials produced good results.

But Mr Best claimed the company, Medical Marketing International, fraudulently withheld the breakthrough in a bid to artificially depress the company's share price.

David Best refused to agree a settlement with the firm which was founded in 1988 by his wife Margaret, 57

He said when he attempted go public with the discovery and expose the conspiracy he was sacked in 2008 for gross misconduct - and gagged for five years.

Mr Best refused to agree a settlement with the firm which was founded in 1988 by his wife Margaret, 57.

Instead, he continued to fight with Cambridge-based MMI - which also produced a new AIDS drug - until it was forced into liquidation in 2010.

When he refused a payment of £31,000 from the liquidators he was cut out of his share of the company, which he claims ran to hundreds of millions.

He then launched a claim for unfair dismissal and an employment tribunal sitting in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire has now found in his favour.

Mr Best, who was earning more than £1 million a year as a former director, has now been awarded a payout of £3.4million.

Panel judge Michael Ord said: 'The sole reason for the claimant's dismissal was his actions in seeking to expose what he, in good faith, believed to be fraud and unlawful activities by his fellow directors and others.

'The response of the company throughout was to ignore or deny any problem, ignore the claimant's complaints and instead seek to find a reason to remove the claimant from the company.'

He added: 'His dismissal, wrongly as being on the grounds of gross misconduct, has caused substantial reputational damage in the pharmaceutical and biomedical world.'

Mr and Mrs Best, from Saffron Walden, Essex, developed MMI through several subsidiaries which worked on new drugs and treatments. They worked together on the company for two decades until Mr Best was sacked.

Ian Carr, of accountants Grant Thornton, was appointed joint administrator as MMI went into liquidation.

He said the liquidators had rejected Mr Best's total claim of more than £800,000 and offered to pay him just over £31,000 in May 2010.

When Mr Best failed to appeal this decision he was left out of the share-out from what remained of the company.

Mr Carr said it was as a result of MMI being unable to settle Mr Best's original claim that the company went into administration.

Mr Best said: 'This court decision is a milestone.

'It now opens up the door to achieve compensation for all who have suffered.

'Obviously this has been a terrible time for me and my immediate family.

'The judge called it "life-changing", but I will not be satisfied until all those who have lost out are fairly compensated.

'Margaret and I owned about a third of the business, so we have lost around £130 million.'

MMI was never shown to have made a profit although in 2005 it was valued at £175m.
