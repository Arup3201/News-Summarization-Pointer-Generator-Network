A US teenager and her family have been offered a free trip to Kenya after their holiday in the African country was ruined when she was mistaken for a British terrorism suspect known as the ‘White Widow’.

Kenya’s government said the 15-year-old girl was 'harassed by police' in Mlolongo, near the capital of Nairobi, 'on accusations of looking like' Samantha Lewthwaite.

The 30-year-old woman, who was born in Banbridge, Northern Ireland, and moved to Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire as a teenager, is subject to an Interpol Red Notice as one of the world’s most wanted fugitives.

'White Widow': Samantha Lewthwaite is one of the most wanted terrorism suspects in the world

To make amends, embarrassed Kenyan government officials have offered an all-expenses-paid holiday to the family and ordered an investigation into the incident.

Lewthwaite was married to Germaine Lindsay, one of four Islamist suicide bombers who killed 52 people in the 7/7 bombings on the London Underground and a bus in 2005. 

The mother of four has been on the run from international authorities for nearly three years after she was charged in December 2011 with plotting a bombing campaign across Kenya.

The Muslim convert has been linked to the Somali Islamic extremist group al-Shabab, which is responsible for a string of deadly attacks in Kenya, including the assault on a Nairobi shopping mall that left at least 67 people dead a year ago. 

There has been no confirmed sighting of Lewthwaite since she escaped from Kenyan police in Mombasa in 2011, reportedly using a false South African passport and alias.

Wanted: Interpol has issued a Red Notice for Samantha Lewthwaite, who is accused of plotting attacks

She is wanted in Kenya on charges of being in possession of explosives and conspiracy to commit a felony.

Last month, Kenyan detectives who are hunting her admitted the trail had gone cold and they believe she has undergone plastic surgery to evade capture.

In a statement, police chief inspector Abednego Kilonzo said she had constantly changed her appearance, name and location while on the run.
