An four-year-old who lost her favourite teddy on the motorway has been reunited with the bear after road workers spent a week looking for it.

Daisy Jewkes was distraught when 'Old Teddy' flew out of the window of her parents' car as they drove down the M6 near Cannock, Staffordshire.

But after her mother Nicola Jewkes, 36, emailed the Highways Agency, the tiny bear was eventually tracked down by one eagle-eyed worker and returned to a delighted Daisy.

Mrs Jewkes said: 'We really thought that he was gone forever.

'It was the kindest thing of him to get Old Teddy back to Daisy - she couldn't have been happier.'

Daisy was in the car with her parents and brothers William, eight, and Ben, six, when she accidentally dropped her toy from the window.

After Daisy cried all the way home, her mother promised to try and find him when they got back to their home in Brierly Hill, West Midlands, after a journey from Scotland.

A week after emailing with their desperate plea, Nicola got a reply to say the teddy been rescued from the central reservation.

David Smith, a manager for construction company Carillon, had even washed Old Teddy before handing him over.

And Daisy was reunited with Old Teddy on her fourth birthday at highway firm Carillion's Cannock offices.

Mr Smith said: 'I got the email and asked the guys to look out for the teddy and within days we found him in the central reservation.

'He was dirty, but after a wash he was perfect again.

'The look on the girl's face was absolutely fantastic when she got him back. We were delighted to help.'

Mrs Jewkes added Daisy was 'completely overwhelmed' when she was finally reunited with her beloved bear.  

She said: 'Even after I emailed them and reassured Daisy, I thought there was no way they'd find him.

'I couldn't believe it and neither could Daisy. She was completely overwhelmed.

'Her face lit up when she got the bear back in her hands.

'She has always had him and she takes him everywhere - he's never out of her sight.

'I know she was incredibly lucky!'
