Stephen Avery with daughter Phoebe, now 14. He died aged 42 after mistakes by Wythenshawe Hospital consultants, an inquest heard

A father-of-two died of a heart infection after doctors missed three chances to save him, an inquest has heard.

Stephen Avery, 42, could have lived if doctors had put him on antibiotics just 48 hours sooner, it was said.

But, despite displaying the telltale symptoms of infection, consultants at Wythenshawe Hospital missed three opportunities to treat the taxi-driver and former local football team manager and coach.

At his inquest in Manchester, heart expert Professor Keith Channer condemned the decisions made by hospital staff.

Describing
 Dr Channer’s evidence as ‘compelling’, coroner Nigel Meadows said: 'An 
appropriate physician should have been able to recognise the symptoms as
 indicated. Had antibiotics started 48 hours before he probably would 
not have died.'

Mr Avery, from Crossacres, Wythenshawe, first visited his GP in October 2011, suffering broken sleep, night sweats and lethargy.

He was diagnosed with a chest infection, and prescribed antibiotics.

But his symptoms worsened after a brief improvement, prompting further antibiotics and a referral.

Then at Wythenshawe Hospital on May 1, 2012, Dr Paul Sanders, consultant rheumatologist, recognised his symptoms as indicating a heart infection, but after tests, failed to diagnose him. 

On his return on May 11, Dr Keith Harkins, consultant physician, again suspected Mr Avery had a heart infection, but stopped his GP-prescribed antibiotics to carry out tests, including a heart scan.

Due to a system failure, the scan order never reached the right department.

On May 14, yet another consultant 
re-ordered the scan urgently, but when his condition was finally 
diagnosed the next day, and an antibiotics drip was started, it was too 
late.

He suffered a cardiac arrest and died on May 15.

Coroner
 Nigel Meadows said Mr Avery, who had a congenital condition which made 
him more susceptible to infection, died of endocarditis.

He said contributory factors were ‘significant failures’ on May 1 and 
May 11 to recognise his symptoms and failure to start the right 
antibiotics drip by the 12th.

He said if the young father had the right scan, diagnosis and treatment earlier, he probably would have survived.

Recording a narrative verdict, Mr Meadows added: 'These medical practitioners are bound to reflect upon their involvement but at the time they thought they were making the right judgements.

'But they were not judgements that were well-founded.'

Popular and well-liked Mr Avery lived in Stockport and worked for Wythenshawe’s Club Cars.

More than 800 people attended his funeral and he left behind wife Jennifer and children Dominic, 18, and Phoebe, 14.

After the hearing his wife, 44, said: 'Wythenshawe Hospital has not only let our family down but they have let our entire community down.

'Stephen was a wonderful family man but also so well-known and loved in the community.

'The findings of the inquest have confirmed the family’s view that Stephen’s death could and should have been avoided if only he had been provided with appropriate and prompt clinical care and management during his time in hospital.'

A University Hospital of South Manchester NHS Foundation Trust spokesman said: 'We would like to offer our sincere condolences to the family of Mr Avery following their very sad loss.

'The trust has reflected on its practice following its investigation to understand what lessons can be learned.

'We will also give full and careful consideration to the comments and feedback from the coroner.'

Infective endocarditis is an infection that can seriously damage the heart valves and cause other serious complications if not treated quickly with antibiotics.

After someone has suffered from the infection they often require surgery to repair or replace damaged heart valves.

It is an infection that affects some parts of the endocardium - the tissue that lines the inside of the heart chambers.

The infection usually involves one or more of the heart valves which are part of the endocardium - it is serious and life-threatening.

Most cases are caused by a bacterial infection and usually occur in a person who has an infection or a wound in another part of the body.

People who inject street drugs are also at greater risk as they can also inject bacteria into their bloodstream if they use dirty needles.

In the UK, endocarditis occurs in about 20 in a million people each year.

It is most common in people with heart valve problems, have had heart valve surgery, have congenital heart defects or who have a poor immune system.

Symptoms include feeling generally unwell, having aches and pains, tiredness, fever and loss of appetite.
