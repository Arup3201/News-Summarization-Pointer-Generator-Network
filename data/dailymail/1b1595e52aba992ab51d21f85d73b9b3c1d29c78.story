The off-duty policeman killed by a crazed gunman was shot at point-blank range as he leaned through the man’s car window and tried to calm him down.

PC Ian Dibell bravely intervened and made the ‘ultimate sacrifice’ after loner Peter Reeve, 64, snapped and pursued neighbour Trevor  Marshall and his girlfriend with  a handgun.

Five shots were fired during the terrifying ten-minute ordeal, including the one that killed the officer. Reeve later dumped his car and went on the run. His body was found the next day on his mother’s grave where he had shot himself with the murder weapon.

Mr Marshall, 48, described how as he ran away pursued by Reeve, who was in his car, PC Dibell approached the car.

‘He leaned into the car on the 
driver’s side,’ he said. ‘I saw them talking for about 30 seconds. Then 
Reeve shot the PC from point-blank range from the driver’s seat.

‘I heard PC Dibell shriek, “Aargh” and
he held his chest and then his face.’ Mr Marshall, who received a 
bullet wound to his arm during the rampage, told The Sun that 
41-year-old PC Dibell ‘stood between me and certain death’.

He added: ‘I was being chased by a man with an armed revolver and PC Dibell confronted him and took a bullet for me.

‘He is a real hero. He paid the ultimate sacrifice to save me, just a normal bloke, a lorry driver.’

Mr Marshall and his girlfriend, Polish-born Kat Karolak, 40, live in the flat below Reeve’s in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex.

Friends and neighbours say Reeve, a 
paranoid and gun-obsessed former bus mechanic, became convinced that the
couple were involved in criminal activities in their flat. He also 
complained of noise.

Mr Marshall, who is divorced, said he 
and Miss Karolak arrived home on Monday afternoon and were confronted by
Reeve, who ‘looked crazed’ and was pointing a loaded revolver at them. 
He fired a shot at them but missed and they barged past him on to the 
road.

Another shot was fired at Miss 
Karolak. Mr Marshall believed she had been killed because she stopped 
screaming for help. In fact, she had managed to run into a nearby house 
where the owners sheltered her.

Danger: Armed police guarded the quite residential road in the hours following the shooting

Mr Marshall avoided another bullet by 
zig-zagging as he ran for his life. Reeve then leapt into his car and 
blocked his route before he was approached by PC Dibell. The officer, 
who was divorced with two stepchildren, lived around the corner with 
partner, Louise Lilley, 38, a police community support officer.

After shooting PC Dibell, Reeve 
resumed the chase. Mr Marshall described how Reeve hit him with his car 
and carried him on his bonnet for a short distance.

He suffered a grazed hand and knee 
when the car scraped against a wall, but then Reeve applied the brakes 
and he fell off. Mr Marshall ran away. Reeve shot at him again, skimming
his arm and leaving him with a flesh wound.

Mr Marshall took shelter in a doorway 
but Reeve suddenly gave up and left, leading to the manhunt, which ended
the next day when his body was found on his mother’s grave 40 miles 
away in the village of Writtle.

Mr Marshall staggered back to where PC
Dibell lay. Staff from a nearby GP’s surgery were treating the 
policeman. Mr Marshall, who was later treated at hospital, said: ‘I 
heard someone say, “He’s gone.” That’s when I broke down.’

Essex Chief Constable Jim Barker-McCardle has praised PC Dibell for his ‘incredible devotion to his community’.
