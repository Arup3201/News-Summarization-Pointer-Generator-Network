Luis Suarez said there is no cause for concern among Liverpool fans as he denied Barcelona and Real Madrid have priority over bidding for him this summer.

Asked about the Spanish giants possible interest in signing him Suarez said: 'As far as I’m aware there is no clause that suggests a priority for any team.

'My head now is focused on the World Cup. Everyone knows there will be media speculation this summer as there always is but I have a contract with Liverpool.'

I don't even look! Suarez said he just turns the page when he sees his name linked with a transfer away

Suarez is used to seeing his name linked with moves away from Anfield, but said he has a foolproof way of avoiding becoming embroiled in any transfer saga.

'I just turn the page,' he added. 'You know what the speculation is like and you try not to take any notice. I know what I want and it is more speculation than reality.'

Presented in Barcelona as the new image of betting company 888poker he admitted there had been tears of rage underneath his Liverpool shirt when he walked off the pitch at Selhurst Park knowing the league was gone.

'I had a lot of rage inside me knowing that just a week before we had a great chance to win the league and in that moment it was the realisation that the opportunity had probably gone.

'I just wanted to hide my face and get down the tunnel. We had had such a great season but it wasn’t going to be enough. The key game was against Chelsea. Maybe we lacked a touch of concentration or focus to stop that goal or create a clear chance after it to get the draw and then depend on ourselves.

'I don’t think they would have scored and a draw would have been OK for us. But after losing that game we knew that we were no longer relying on ourselves and that was a big blow psychologically to the team.

'It’s been a great season. We did all we could do. Every player gave absolutely everything. We would have taken just being in the top four at the end of the season. But then coming so close it was heart-breaking to miss out.

'When we started the season the aim was to finish in the top four but over the course of the season it became clear that we had a chance to win the league. Then you have the disappointment of not doing that but if we look back at that original target then we should be really happy.

'We are back in the Champions League, which is where Liverpool belongs. My season wasn’t bad. The whole team played really well and we gave the fans something to be proud of.'

Challenge: Suarez is going head-to-head with Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo for European Golden Boot

Suarez can
 still win the Golden Boot for most league goals in a European season 
and said: 'It’s an honour for me to be fighting for it with the likes of
 Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Diego Costa who has also had an 
incredible season.'

If
 Ronaldo fails to score this weekend the two will finish with the same 
number of goals and Suarez would win with a better goals per games 
ratio.

Asked
 if Liverpool’s title chances next season will be improved by their 
experience in this campaign he said: 'Well we were first with just a few
 weeks left so that will give the younger players great experience going
 into next season. Those young players will grow and be even stronger 
next time.'
