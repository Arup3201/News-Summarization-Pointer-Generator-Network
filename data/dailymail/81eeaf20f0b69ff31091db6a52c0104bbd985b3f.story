The Chinese police chief who exposed the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood and then tried to defect to the US, has gone on trial in China.

The case of Wang Lijun - who is charged with defection, abuse of power and bribe-taking - is being held behind closed doors amid tight security in Chengdu, the western Chinese city to which he fled in February and handed over sensitive information about Heywood’s grisly death to US consulate officials.

His dramatic flight for freedom lead to the downfall of powerful politician Bo Xilai and the conviction of Bo’s wife, Gu Kailai, who was last month handed a suspended death sentence for poisoning 41-year-old Heywood over a business dispute.

The scandal has thrown the ruling Communist Party’s carefully choreographed once-in-decade power transition into disarray.

'The
hearing was closed according to Chinese law because it involves state 
secrets. The trial has two parts, private and public.

Tuesday
is the private part because it involves state secrets - it was about 
the two charges of defection and bending the law for his own ends,” said
Wang’s lawyer, Wang Yuncai, who declined to elaborate on case details.

Wang, 52, is the former mafia-busting cop and right hand man of popular party secretary Bo Xilai.

The pair ruled with an iron fist over the western Chinese mega city of Chongqing and enjoyed national fame together.

But their relationship imploded late last year after the death of Heywood and the erratic behaviour of Bo’s wife Gu, who with the help of her orderly killed the Briton with a cyanide-laced drink following a business dispute. 

Prosecutors in her trial claimed she conferred with Wang before murdering Heywood and reported back to him afterwards.

Wang then fled with details of the murder and pleaded for protection from the US after falling out with Bo earlier this year. 

But he was persuaded after 30 hours of what was fast becoming an embarrassing diplomatic dispute to hand himself over to Chinese armed police who had surrounded the consulate.

British officials have been criticised for not acting sooner on the information handed to them by the US about Wang’s murder file.

'We made every effort to establish whether additional information existed,'  a spokesman for the British Embassy said.

What is certain is that Heywood’s murder would likely never have been investigated had Wang not fled to the US consulate and Bo Xilai would still be in line for a seat on China's most powerful political body, the standing committee of the Politburo.

Rumours: China's leader in waiting, Xi Jinping was not seen in public for two weeks

Earlier Chinese state media reported the evidence against Wang was 'concrete and abundant', shorthand for his fate has already been decided by the government, which runs the country’s courts.  

Several other policemen accused in covering up Heywood's murder have already been jailed for long sentences and defector Wang could face the death penalty if found guilty.

His trial is a next step for China’s leadership in its attempt to move past the scandal and deal with Bo, the revered son of a revolutionary veteran who has a web of political contacts and allies, including generals in the country’s all-powerful military.

But China’s rulers appear divided over how to deal with him – he remains under house arrests-  and the scandal’s fallout continues to dog the leadership transition. 

A date for the party congress to install the new leadership has yet be announced, though it is expected to held in mid- to late October. 

Many experts believe the infighting in some way explained the prolonged absence of leader in waiting, Xi Jinping.

Xi was not seen in public for two weeks and had cancelled high level meetings which sparked rumours about his health. 

The government refused to say why he was absent and he reappeared at the weekend. Many believe he has been behind the scenes attempting to appease factions within the top echelons of the secretive government.
