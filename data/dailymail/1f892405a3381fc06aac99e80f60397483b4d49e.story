Possible father: Jonathan Smith, 31, claims that he could be the father of Josie Cunningham's baby after sleeping with her over four years without protection

A homeless friend of controversial wannabe glamour model Josie Cunningham has admitted that he could be the father of her baby.

Jonathan Smith, 31, claimed that he is one of two men in line to be the father, but will only find out when the baby boy is born in October.

He told the Sunday Mirror: 'If the baby isn't black when it comes out, I'm going to have a DNA test.'

He said that he started sleeping with the mother-of-two in 2010 but admitted they had never once used protection - 
despite him knowing that she was sleeping with other men.

Miss Cunningham, a former prostitute, has previously confessed that she was 'ashamed' to admit she did not know who the father of the baby is as she had slept with one client and had been having 'casual sex' with a friend at the time she conceived.

Mr Smith, who is jobless, has come forward to claim that he is Ms Cunningham's 'friend with benefits'.

He said that the mother-of-two told him three months ago that she had slept with him and a black man over the weeks she conceived.

He recalled: 'She told me "I've slept with you and a black lad in those dates. So if it doesn't come out black, you'd better run because it will be your child".'

Yesterday Miss Cunningham, 24, whose baby son is due in October, announced that she is selling more than £10,000 worth of tickets to 50 fans who will be able to watch the birth over video chat service Skype.

Miss Cunningham, who rose to fame 
after undergoing a £4,800 breast enlargement on the NHS, has already 
scooped a staggering £30,000 for the four VIP bedside seats.

Three of the four tickets were purchased
 by journalists while the fourth is believed to have been bought by 
somebody described as 'a super-fan'.

Her announcement that she was going to sell the £200 Skype tickets came just two days after Miss Cunningham revealed on Twitter that she plans to sell her placenta to the highest bidder.

Mr Smith said that he felt scared when Miss Cunningham, from Leeds, broke down in tears and told him about the baby as he is homeless and already has three children who he doesn't see.

He added that he last slept with Miss Cunningham three months ago, after she said that they might be having a baby together.

As well as the NHS breast surgery, which increased her bust from a 32A to 36DD, Miss Cunningham has undergone Botox on the NHS over a 'sweat problem'.

She claimed she needed the breast enlargement because she had been bullied since the age of 14 for being flat chested.

Earlier this year, she sparked further 
outrage after publicly considering aborting the son she is due to give 
birth to because the pregnancy prevented her from appearing on Channel 
5's Big Brother.

Just weeks later, she claimed she was receiving 
negative attention on public transport and asked the council to provide 
her with a £6,000-a-year taxi to take her children to school.

Leeds
 City Council eventually decided to axe the service, prompting Miss 
Cunningham to Tweet: ‘Sticks and stones may break my bones but taxpayers
 will always fund me.’

She later added: 'If the council think I’m getting a bus, they can think again.'

Earlier this month Miss Cunningham declared she was 'genuinely gutted' to discover she was expecting a third boy, not the little girl she had hoped for.

The wannabe model, who already has two boys, aged six and three, said she smoked a whole packed of cigarettes and drowned her sorrows with a glass of wine after finding out her baby's sex.
