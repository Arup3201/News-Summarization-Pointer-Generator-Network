Sacked: Headteacher Bernie Routledge claims he was unfairly dismissed from his role as headteacher of the exclusive Howell's School in Wales

The sacked principal of an exclusive girls-only boarding school allegedly breached his own rules on social networking by commenting on an appreciation page dedicated to himself - called BRAS.

Bernie Routledge commented on the page called the Bernie Routledge Appreciation Society - set up by pupils at another school - while head of the Howell's School in Denbigh north Wales, an employment tribunal has heard.

Mr Routledge, who was principal of the school for nine months before he was sacked in May 2011, is said to have used the page to interact with pupils over two days in 2009.

He claims that he was unfairly dismissed by the school, which boarders pay £18,000-a-year to attend.

John Benson, representing Mr Routledge at the Wrexham hearing, questioned Howell's School trustee Robert Locke's handling of the situation yesterday.

The hearing was told that there were ten allegations of misconduct against Mr Routledge, of Gwernaffield near Mold, number one being social networking with children.

Mr Locke said: 'Mr Routledge wrote the social networking rules himself, which he breached.'

He added that he had contacted children's services and the police, but was told it was not a criminal matter and should be dealt with by the school.

Mr Benson asked Mr Locke why he never spoke to Mr Routledge about the Facebook page before suspending him.

He also claimed Mr Locke was already 'livid' with the principal following a boarding inspection and said it was the start of a campaign to get rid of him.

Mr Locke admitted there were 'procedural flaws for not permitting an appeal for Mr Routledge'.

Mr Routledge's partner, Helen Price, former head of pastoral care at the school, is also claiming unfair dismissal.

She was pregnant at the time of her sacking.

Mr Locke, who dismissed Mr Routledge following an investigation carried out by his brother Alan Locke, said of Ms Price's dismissal: 'It was abrupt and because of her conduct at Mr Routledge's disciplinary hearing there was a complete breakdown of mutual trust.

'Ms Price was a child protection officer at the school and in our view she failed as she was in a relationship with the headmaster.

'I am concerned there was no whistleblowing from Ms Price regarding Mr Routledge.'

Mr Benson asked Robert Locke why Ms Price was never given a disciplinary hearing and was never told the outcome of her grievance hearing.

Robert Locke said: 'She showed her views at Mr Routledge's hearing and we did not want to give them another hearing to berate us [the trustees].'

He added that it was 'because of the seriousness of the allegations against her partner Mr Routledge'.

'We were not going to put Ms Price through an investigation as this puts her under pressure, especially as she was pregnant at the time,' he said.

Mr Routledge previously taught at The King's School in Chester.

He was appointed deputy principal at Howell's in 2010, and took over as principal a few months later.

The tribunal continues.
