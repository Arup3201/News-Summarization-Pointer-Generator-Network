Mother-of-two: Jillian Hewson, was found drowned in the bath after collapsing with a heart condition

A teaching assistant was found by her son drowned in the bath after collapsing with a heart condition, an inquest heard yesterday.

Mother-of-two Jillian Hewson, 38, was discovered at her £150,000 three-bedroom detached house in Royton, Greater Manchester.

Her mother Linden Slater, 65, said: ‘We are all devastated by what has happened. She was very popular a beautiful mum, our sunshine girl.

‘It is such a terrible, tragic loss for myself and her brother Matthew. She was such a joy to be around. We miss her so much.’

Mrs Hewson’s husband David, 42, described the former national swimming champion as ‘an outgoing woman with a beautiful smile’.

The couple had met while she was at university in Swansea before they emigrated to Australia.

There, they married and had two children, Joe, 10, and Anna, eight, before returning to the North West seven years ago.

Mr Hewson said: ‘She was loved around the world and is missed by so many people. Friends and colleagues in Australia have even named a star in her honour. She loved working at St Joseph’s [Primary School] in Shaw and they loved her too.’

The school has set up a Jillian Slater Endeavour Award at a local swimming gala in her honour.

Cousin Alex Woodward added: ‘She was the type of girl who would put on high heels just to go to Asda and always looked her best. Her glass was always half-full - she saw the positives in everything. She never had a bad word to say about anyone.’

Another cousin, Joanne Lucy, said: ‘Her children are coping but are still obviously upset. We have a big supportive family so they have been taken into the fold and they are so loved by everyone. But nothing will bring her back.’

Mrs Hewson, who was separated from her husband, was discovered unconscious in the bath at her home by her son, who raised the alarm with neighbours shortly after 5.15pm on June 30 last year.

An ambulance was called and attempts were made to revive her both by neighbours and medical professionals - however, she was pronounced dead at the Royal Oldham Hospital just after 6.30pm.

The inquest, which was attended by more than a dozen relatives, heard that Mrs Hewson had suffered three blackouts in the two years before her death and had been diagnosed with hypothyroidism, also known as an underactive thyroid gland, in May, 2012.

The condition causes body functions, in particular the beating of the heart, to slow down and can lead to dizzy spells or blackouts as the heart struggles to pump enough oxygenated blood around the body and to the brain.

Mrs Hewson was prescribed medication to combat the effects of the condition but a toxicology report did not find the drug in her system at the time of her death.

However, it was suggested in the report 
that she could have taken it just before her death without it being 
absorbed into the system, therefore making it untraceable.

Consultant pathologist Dr Antonio Paiva-Correia also found that she suffered from left ventricular hypertrophy, a thickening of the heart muscle, which had not previously been diagnosed.

The condition, which often occurs naturally in athletes and swimmers, can also make it harder for the heart to function properly.

Dr Paiva-Correia described the cause of death as drowning where hypothyroidism, left ventricular hypertrophy and aortic valve stenosis (a narrowing of the valve controlling blood) had been contributing factors.

Police also confirmed the absence of any criminal or suspicious circumstances at the scene.

Senior Coroner Simon Nelson recorded a verdict of accidental death to which pre-existing natural conditions were a significant contributing factor.

He said: ‘I could not believe it when I saw how many people were here today. It is a testament to Mrs Hewson, her character and the aspects of personality that made her so loved.’
