Crystal Palace have completed the signing of Manchester United winger Wilfried Zaha on a season-long loan deal, both clubs have announced.

Zaha returns to Palace after just two appearances for United, despite costing the Old Trafford club £15million in January 2013.

The 21-year-old becomes new Palace boss Neil Warnock's first signing in his second stint in the Selhurst Park hotseat.

Palace said in a statement on their website: 'Crystal Palace are delighted to confirm that winger Wilfried Zaha has re-joined the club on loan from Manchester United.

'The two-cap England international has agreed a deal that will see him spend the entire 2014/15 season at Selhurst Park.'  

New Eagles manager Neil Warnock revealed on Thursday morning he spoke to Zaha about making the switch.

'I did speak to him last night,' Warnock told talkSPORT.

'I spent half an hour telling him why I want him to come back and I'm optimistic we are going to do it today.'

Ivory Coast-born Zaha made more than 100 appearances in three years at Crystal Palace, progressing through the junior ranks at Selhurst Park.

The England Under-21 graduate is deemed surplus to requirements under new manager Louis van Gaal, paving the way for another stint at Palace.

Warnock was appointed Palace's new manager on Wednesday, ending owner Steve Parish's lengthy search to replace Tony Pulis, who walked out of the club on the eve of the new season.

Former Sheffield United boss Warnock rubbished suggestions Zaha has an attitude problem, backing him to realise his rich potential in south London.

'When you get the chance, you can't turn down Manchester United but there are so many big players there and sometimes you get a bit lost,' said Warnock.

'He is still developing, Wilfried, and he has got so much talent. When you are a wide player, or a forward, you need to feel loved.

'I've heard it said about his attitude, but I've always thought his attitude has been spot on, so I'm looking forward to working with him.'
