A 58-year-old woman in a wheelchair was killed after being run over by THREE drivers who fled the scene and left her to die.

Edith McFarland was trying to cross a busy road on Tuesday night after going grocery shopping when she was struck by an SUV and flung from her wheelchair before being hit by two more vehicles. 

The grandmother from Delaware was left  wheelchair-bound after losing a leg in another hit and run accident two decades ago on Route 13, Wilmington - the same route she died on. 

Tragic: Edith McFarland's crumpled wheelchair marks the spot she was hit by a SUV before two more vehicles ran her over and left her to die

Delaware State Police said the first collision happened at 6.35pm and involved a gold SUV, reports CBS Philly.

Tragic: Relatives said Edith McFarland, 58, was a caring person who did not have much but did her best to help her family and friends

State Police Sergeant Paul Shavack said: 'She was ejected from the wheelchair into the southbound lanes.

'And then she was struck by two additional vehicles.'

One vehicle is unconscionable. Three vehicles is unthinkable.'

McFarland was taking groceries home to the nearby Fairview Inn motel.

She had moved there three months ago with her son Jeremy and her two grandchildren.

Her son is calling on the drivers responsible for his mother's death to come forward.

'If you did this, if it was an accident, it was an accident, but don’t just drive away from the woman,' Jeremy told CBS Philly.

He says his mother was a caring person who did everything she could to help her family and friends.

Distraught: Edith McFarland's son Jeremy breaks down as he makes an emotional appeal to the drivers to step forward and contact the police

'We didn’t have very much anyway, but she’d give anybody what she had,' he said.

McFarland's neighbor Robin Smith told CBS Philly that she hoped the drivers would contact the police.

Grief: Robin Smith, Edith McFarland's neighbor said she hoped the drivers would come forward and give the grandmother's family justice

Fatal: Delaware State Police said the first collision happened at 6.35pm on Route 13 also known as Market Street, and involved a gold SUV

'I pray to God that whoever hit her, their heart would be so heavy that they would turn themselves in and there would be justice for her family,' she said.

'They killed that woman. They killed her and kept going.'

Police do not have a description of either the second or third vehicles, but  are still interviewing witnesses.

Anyone with information is asked to call Delaware State Police on 302-834-2620 Ext. 275 or Delaware Crime Stoppers at 1-800-TIP-3333.
