England Under-21 captain Andre Wisdom's heart must have sank when his beloved £100,000 Porsche got stuck in a muddy ditch. 

The 20-year-old footballer was forced to abandon his car after it became submerged in the pit in the middle of remote woods around three miles from the nearest main road.

It is thought the expensive car, which Wisdom has boasted about on social networking sites, became stuck in the 2ft deep, 15ft wide, 30ft long puddle sometime on Friday.

But it was only discovered the following morning when mountain biker Pete Irons, came across the empty Porsche Panamera Turbo and informed police.

Mr Irons, 41, said: 'I didn't really think much of it when I first saw it. I thought whoever it was was unlucky to have done that but I also thought it would be gone by the afternoon.

'When I came back through the woods a little later with friends it was still there.

'We were all joking about the poor guy who had managed to get it stuck and how much money it was going to cost them.

To get to that point he would have to have come through an equally muddy section, I have no idea what he was thinking.

'I just can't believe he could have got that far to begin with, then to submerge it in that puddle.

'We are miles from any main road and the track doesn't go anywhere, it's just mind boggling how he ended up there.

'He would have got so muddy trying to escape it too - there was no way he could have got out without getting covered.'

The international footballer who plays in defence is currently on loan from Liverpool to Derby County.

His team play six miles from where the car was discovered close to the Breadsall Priory Marriott Hotel on the outskirts of the city.

But his hapless driving did not affect his performance on the pitch after Derby pulled off a convincing 3-0 win at home to Sheffield Wednesday on Saturday.

It is unknown how the Porsche got into the ditch or how Wisdom escaped but the car was later moved by a Jeep Cherokee and driven away.

'I noticed a Jeep dragging it away later but it was too dark to look at who it was driving,' added Pete.

'It seemed okay enough, just a bit muddy. A neighbour said she saw a very muddy Porsche driving down the road a little after that, apparently it was emitting a massive cloud of white smoke as it was going.

'I think it will definitely need a bit of TLC in a garage.'

Wisdom was not available for comment today but Derby County said a Sat Nav error had led Wisdom into the muddy ditch.

A club spokesman said: 'Andre visited a local shop on the way to Saturday's game against Sheffield Wednesday and, being new and unfamiliar to the area, he programmed the stadium's postcode into his Sat Nav.

'The route provided took him down a less than traditional road, where conditions were also poor, and ultimately his car got stuck and he, along with the club, made suitable arrangements to ensure he was at Pride Park Stadium on time for the game and his car was recovered on Saturday evening.'
