A woman who lived on a diet of chips for 15 years has finally eaten a proper meal - after being hynoptised to overcome her debilitating fear of food.

Hanna Little, 20, has eaten chips every day since she was five years old - after she developed a fear of all other foods which made her physically sick if she tried to eat them.

Hanna from Truro, Cornwall, has severe Selective Eating Disorder (SED) and would suffer anxiety attacks at the thought of eating anything new.

Hanna Little, 20, has eaten chips every day since she was five years old, when she developed a fear of all other foods. But one hypnotherapy session changed her life

Hanna could never eat with her friends, had to check menus before visiting restaurants and was in a constant panic about how she would react to new foods.

It was only when she was forced to quit her factory job after she kept passing out due to her limited diet that she was forced to take action.

Now after just one hypnotherapy session, she has managed to battle her demons - and has eaten her first proper meal - pizza - in more than a decade.

Hanna said: 'Refusing foods started when I developed colic as a baby - I've had SED for as long as I can remember - I never really knew what scared me about new food.

Hanna visited psychologist and clinical hypnotist Felix Economakis (pictured), at The Heath therapy clinic in North London, who got her to eat a mango after their first session together

'Different foods terrified me, it made me physically sick and anxious and I never knew how I would react.

'I would go to parties, picnics and barbecues with my friends but I would never be able to eat anything.

'I think I can eat chips because they're just plain - it was the idea of different flavours mixing together which really freaked me out.

'I could manage a slice of dry toast for breakfast, but lunch and dinner every day always had to be chips.

'Now I can eat whatever I like - my favourite food is pizza - I could never have imagined being able to eat it before the treatment but now I love it.'

Different foods terrified Hanna and made her physically sick and anxious so she opted for chips every single day, which caused her to pass out at work

Hanna's mum tried to tempt her with new vegetables and fruits but would be forced to bulk buy chips and bread from the supermarket when she continually failed.

Hanna said: 'When I was old enough to date I went to my boyfriend's house for dinner but I hadn't told him about my SED.

'The hypnotherapy treatment was amazing, I was so restricted before and now I can live a normal life. I feel so much healthier and I am putting weight on - I have so much more energy and I feel much happier'

'His mum made me an incredible pasta bake meal and I couldn't eat a bite of it - I pretended that I was allergic to tomato sauce - it was so embarrassing.

'Everyone I spoke to had no idea what it was and just though I was odd - I didn't find out about Selective Eating Disorder until I was 16.'

Hanna visited psychologist and clinical hypnotist Felix Economakis, at The Heath therapy clinic in North London.

He said: 'SED is usually caused by a trauma 
associated with food - it is often something that has happened as a baby
 that the patient has no conscious memory of.

'The fear of food stems from this trauma and the anxiety associated with it.

'By
 unlocking the subconscious I can get the patient to process the past 
and learn to let go of the fear - detraumatising the experience.

'The hypnosis process takes just over an hour and at the end of the session Hanna was able to try several types of new food without anxiety.

'The result of the therapy is immediately measurable and with 90 per cent of the SED patients I have worked with, hypnosis treatment has been incredibly effective.'

Hanna said: 'I'd seen so many dieticians and psychologists before I went for hypnotherapy but nothing had worked.

'I could feel my health deteriorating and I knew I had to do something about it - that's when I met Felix and he told me about hypnotherapy treatments.

'The first thing I ate after the hypnotherapy was a mango - it was so sweet and delicious and it is now my favourite fruit.

'The hypnotherapy treatment was amazing, I was so restricted before and now I can live a normal life.

'I feel so much healthier and I am putting weight on - I have so much more energy and I feel much happier.'

SED is also known as picky eating, fussy eating, food phobia, selective eating, or Perseverative Feeding Disorder.

It is more common among those within the autistic spectrum and in combination with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.

It starts in childhood or early adolescence and the
 most common cause of SED is a development of extra sensitive taste sensation, which is caused 
by an increase in fungiform papilla – taste buds - throughout childhood.

Typically
 the food preferred by an SED sufferer are ‘comfort foods’ – bland and 
refined foods, high in carbohydrates – such as pizza, cheese and chips, 
often from particular brands or food outlets.

The types of food will be restricted to ten or less with extreme cases only eating one or two types of food.

SED
 sufferers can get psychiatric help such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
 and other treatments for OCD which have been successful.
