A woman is being hunted by police after she was caught on surveillance video poking strangers with a mysterious 'sharp object' in a New Orleans street.

The brown-haired suspect, who has not been identified, was captured jabbing two men, aged 28 and 62, and possibly others with the long, black item in the city's French Quarter on Sunday night.

Donning an oversized camouflage jacket, she was first spotted walking along the pavement at 8.45pm, before suddenly lunging forward and stabbing the older man as he rode past on a bike.
