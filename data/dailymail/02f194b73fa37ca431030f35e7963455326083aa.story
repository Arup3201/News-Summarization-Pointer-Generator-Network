The search for Madeleine McCann has taken police to all corners of the globe.

But now they are going back to where the tragic case began to excavate key sites in the Algarve holiday resort where she vanished seven years ago.

The Met Police have been granted permission by Portuguese authorities to dig up land in Praia da Luz and they said the searches will begin within weeks.

Madeleine, who would be ten on 12 May, was three when she vanished from her holiday flat on 3 May 2007

There are serious concerns, however, 
that their efforts could be blocked at any point by the Portuguese 
authorities, amid continuing tensions between the forces.

The
 crucial development in the multi-million pound inquiry comes as sources
 said it has been a ‘hugely emotional time’ for the McCanns.

The seventh anniversary of Maddie’s disappearance on May 3, 2007, fell on Saturday.

While
 her parents, Gerry and Kate, both 45, have been briefed on the plans, 
they are not travelling to the resort while work is carried out.

The 
cold case review into the three-year-old’s disappearance, known as 
Operation Grange, has seen a team of detectives painstakingly search 
through every document collected throughout the inquiry.

Search site: The waste ground in Praia da Luz, Portugal, where Scotland Yard officers will join local police officers in digging as part of the investigation

Abroad: Specialist search teams will start by scouring sites across Praia da Luz - including this waste ground near the Ocean Club apartment complex

The digs are not thought to necessarily be in connection with a search for the youngster's body or remains

This land that was not fenced at the time of the disappearance of Madeleine McCann is contiguous to the path where witnesses saw a man passing with a child in pyjamas in her arms the night of the disappearance

According
 to local reports, one of the key search areas is a patch of wasteland 
about the size of three football pitches, across the road from Ocean 
Club where the McCanns were staying, as well as the tapas bar where they
 were dining when Maddie disappeared.

The
 area, which is beside a school and has become overgrown with bushes and
 strewn with rocks, used to be an open expanse but is now fenced off. In
 the picture above, it is marked search area one.

The
 McCanns prayed for Maddie’s safe return in the nearby Church of Nossa 
Senhora da Luz (Our Lady of the Light). At the time the roads 
surrounding the 16th century church were being renovated, with huge 
potholes sealed over just days after Maddie vanished. This will also be a
 key site for excavation and is marked in the picture above as search 
area two.

A sign at the church yesterday informed worshippers of planned ‘maintenance works’ to the church and the surrounding area.

According
 to Portuguese daily Jornal de Noticias, officers will excavate a third 
location closer to the beach (marked in the picture above as search area
 three), as well as two patches of land in the countryside surrounding 
Praia da Luz.

Detectives are expected to use radar equipment to examine 
the sites. The tools can detect changes in magnetic fields caused when 
earth is disturbed and changes to wet soil caused by burial of a body. 
It is thought that mechanical diggers and other earth-moving equipment 
will be brought in.

Metropolitan Police’s Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowler has blamed the Portuguese authorities for the lack of information being made public by Operation Grange.

In an open letter dated today, the senior police officer said that despite pleas for the media to be briefed on ongoing developments in the search for Madeline McCann, Portugal’s Policia Judiciara have threatened to stop work if information is passed on.

Revealing the ongoing tension between British and Portuguese police, Assistant Commissioner Rowley said he had explained to his opposite number in the Policia Judiciara that it is the Met’s preferred practice to make public as much information and context as possible, providing it does not compromise the investigation.

He revealed that the reply from the Portuguese police was that they do not brief the media on an ongoing investigation, accompanied by a threat that if any information were to emerge, the work undertaken by Portugal on behalf of Scotland Yard would ‘cease until that problem dissipates’.

‘It is important you understand this and appreciate the position in which I find myself. We will not be able to provide any information concerning the activity because ultimately it could mean the work stops,’ Assistant Commissioner Rowley said.

‘We respect the Portuguese position as we would expect them to respect our position if we were carrying out work on their behalf in the UK,’ he added.

Aerial 
photographs are set to be taken to assess the area, while officers will 
look for disturbances among rocks, any signs of excess soil and changes 
in vegetation.

The searches will be conducted by Portuguese police, with British detectives on site alongside them.

Yesterday,
 Met Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said there was a constant
 threat that their Portuguese colleagues could halt the work.

In
 an open letter to the media, he added: ‘This case has for some time 
been moving towards increased action in Portugal.

'Whilst the process is 
more bureaucratic and slower than we would wish, I now believe that 
activity will occur in forthcoming weeks.

‘The
 most important task for me is to build momentum and protect our 
investigation, given the many lines of inquiry that we see are necessary
 in order that we can do everything possible to solve the case.

'We do 
not want to undermine our prospects of providing Mr and Mrs McCann with 
answers.’

On Saturday, prayers were said for Maddie at her parents’ local church in Rothley, Leicestershire, to mark the anniversary.

Mr
 McCann said: ‘The Met are going back out to Portugal very soon.

'They 
are chipping away and there is new evidence.

'We are going to continue 
hoping we get a  happy outcome.’

Madeleine’s
 11th birthday is next Monday. The attorney general’s office in Portugal
 confirmed that the Met Police have made five requests for help with 
their investigation since August 2012, most recently this March.

Police 
have to write formally to the Portuguese judiciary every time they want 
to act on information they believe needs to be investigated.

A spokesman said the contents of the requests are confidential.

Last
 night, a source said that a few Scotland Yard officers are ‘discreetly’
 on the ground in Praia da Luz, with a full team flying over in a few 
days.

Portuguese police initially searched the resort, but the Met will look for anything they might have missed
