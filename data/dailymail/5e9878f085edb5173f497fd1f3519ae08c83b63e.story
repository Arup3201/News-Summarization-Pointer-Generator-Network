At the moment, the custom-designed travel concept is only available in Nordic countries.

However, Luxury Action say that the country's striking scenery will provide the perfect location for customers who want to create scenes involving car chases and action scenes, Western-style narratives and fantasy storylines similar to The Hobbit and Alice in Wonderland.

Called 'The Hollywood Experience', the concept was created by Janne Honkanen, owner of Luxury Action.

Mr Honkanen joined forces with award-winning production manager Bruton Jones, whose previous work includes blockbusters such as The Rock, Armageddon and Wesley Snipes thriller, Blade.

The brochure states: 'Your options are only limited by your imagination as you are the architect for your luxury action adventure.

'Consider yourself the head writer of Hollywood's next big blockbuster featuring you as its star.

'First the client submits a literary or visual narrative which will act as a script.

A professional camera and production team will layout the key scenes and story points to record the clients custom narrative

The company explains: 'This should contain specific points you feel the experience should have. Want a car chase, helicopter dogfight or even a brief encounter with Bigfoot? Let us know!'

'Once you have consulted with a luxury Action professional and submitted your narrative guide, we will begin processing your special requests by handing it over to our team of expert adventure co-ordinators.'

The company say the initial design process takes up to three weeks before it is finally approved.

They add: 'On location, a professional camera and production team will layout the key scenes and story points to record the clients custom narrative.

'Once the experience has been captured, the narrative will be assembled and edited to the level of the clients expectations of vision.

'The edit will adhere to the same quality standards as Hollywood television and movies, featuring custom soundtracks and effects.

While the company gives the example of creating a film about parents who want to travel with their children to Santa's workshop in the North Pole, or a Bourne fan who wants his own car chase caught on video.

The custom design work, planning and script development costs €20,000 (£15,750) per week to put together.

The cost of the shoot and edit are extra.

Talking about how he came up with the idea, Mr Honkanen told the MailOnline: 'We have many returning clients and I noticed that they are looking all the time fopr something upgraded and more personalised. 

Each client is given a personalised ticket to ride to launch their experience

Mystical ideas and all-action adventures are among the personalised tours that holidaymakers can have filmed

Romantic adventures, such as honeymoons, are also catered for by the company

'Then I started thinking of wealthy, but busy business people who have dreams and I wanted to offer something unique to their family and children.

'Nowadays, the best investment is to give time to your family and share the experiences. Memories remain forever. Now, we can make your dreams come true, or even to create new ones.

'I have made my dreams come true in life, I have had a chocolate shop, after I saw the movie called Chocolat with Johnny Depp, I had two ice cream shops, I was professional racing pilot in USA.    

The custom design work, planning and script development costs €20,000 (£15,750) per week to put together, but will allow clients to take part in car chases and action sequences

Despite its name, Mr Honkanen says his travel package is more about the travel aspect than the film component, which is optional.

'In case a client does not have the own story of dreams, on request we will write the script and story.

'We deliver everything in a book beforehand and after we agree everything, a client will live the narrative. 

'Travel through Norwegian Fjors, meet the elves with Santa Claus in the Arctic Circle, experience the ultimate Scandinavia package where everything is custom designed only for you.

'Usually it takes minimum of one week to make proposal, but if it is a luxury wedding, or other similar high-end occasion, it can take from one week up to few months writing script and creating the unique story.

'Based on my current experience, I think that our Arab clients are a very curious and interested of this service, but also Asian and American clients.  

'Depending on budget and if a client wishes to have a reality style documentation, 3- 4 film crew is enough. 

'In case we go Hollywood style, then film crew can be up to up to 10- 20 persons.'
