Renewing a push for paid leave for workers, President Barack Obama on Thursday will call on Congress, states and cities to pass measures to allow millions of workers to earn up to a week of paid sick time a year.

He'll also ask Congress for more than $2 billion in new spending to encourage states to create paid family and medical leave programs, the White House says.

In addition, Obama will use executive discretion to give federal employees – men and women alike – up to six weeks of paid sick leave to care for a new child.

'The fact is this is not a partisan issue. It’s a family issue, and it’s an economic issue, senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, said.

'Adopting policies that are good for working families is both good for business and good for workers.'

More than 40 million U.S. private sector workers don't have any type of paid sick leave, Jarrett said, 'Not a single day.'

That means they lose pay if they stay home when sick or to care for someone who is. 

The White House confirmed Thursday night that Obama's policy proposal dealing with paid time off for new parents will apply to men as well as women. 

A White House fact sheet on the policy proposal argues that 'many workers will go to work sick, putting their coworkers and customers at risk of illness. And even if workers have access to paid sick leave for themselves, they may not be able to use it to care for sick children. 

'This forces many parents to choose between taking an unpaid day off work—losing much needed income and potentially threatening his or her job—and sending a child who should be home in bed to school,' the White House said.

The president's spokesman said today that the policy is both family-friendly and business-friendly because going to work sick with an illness like the flu will 'only serve to spread the flu to your fellow coworkers. That is bad for businesses because they have a whole slew of employees out sick, he said. 

Details on how Obama would raise the $2 billion to help states will be released in the president's budget proposal next month, Jarrett said Wednesday.

Obama wants Congress to pass legislation that has been sponsored since 2005 by Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro to allow workers to earn up to seven days, or 56 hours, of paid sick leave to care for themselves or a sick family member, obtain preventive care or deal with domestic violence. 

Under the Healthy Families Act, workers would earn an hour of paid sick time for every 30 hours they work. Employers that already provide paid sick time would not have to change their policies as long as the time earned can be used for the same purposes.

Obama will call on states and cities to adopt similar legislation. Some already have, as the White House noted in a fact sheet.

The president will also outline ways to broaden access to paid family and medical leave. 

Under the 1993 federal Family and Medical Leave Act, workers may take up to 12 weeks of unpaid time off without losing their job to care for a new child, recover from an illness or care for an ill family member. 

The White House says most families cannot afford such long stretches of time off without pay.

'We can't say we stand for family values when so many women in this country have to jeopardize their financial security just to take a few weeks off of work after giving birth,' Jarrett said in a Linkedin post previewing the initiative on Wednesday.

Three states — California, New Jersey and Rhode Island – offer paid family and medical leave. 

To encourage others to follow, Obama will propose $2.2 billion in new spending to reimburse up to five states for three years for the actual and administrative costs associated with implementing similar programs.

The White House says Obama's budget will also include a request for $35 million to be put toward competitive grants for states working toward implementing paid leave programs.

Additionally, the Department of Labor will spend $1 million in funds it already has to help states and localities conduct studies to determine the ramifications of paid family leave policies.

With regard to the federal workforce, Obama will propose legislation providing six weeks of paid administrative leave for the birth, adoption or foster placement of a child. 

Federal workers receive paid sick leave and vacation time, but no paid time off specifically for family or parental leave. Under the proposal, federal workers could use sick time to care for a healthy child after birth or adoption.

Obama also planned to direct federal agencies to advance six weeks of paid sick leave that federal workers could use as paid family leave, something agencies can do if they decide to, said Obama economic adviser Betsey Stevenson. 

Workers would be required to pay back the sick leave over time.

Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander, chairman of the Senate's labor committee, said Obama's proposed measures would set back workers and make it more difficult for entrepreneurs to start their own businesses .

'Americans have great freedom when it comes to work—they can choose the career they like and negotiate with their employer for the things they need, and they can one day become employers, opening businesses with few restrictions compared to the rest of the world,' the Republican senator said.

'One more government mandate, however well-intentioned, will only reduce those freedoms—making it harder for employees to find jobs, negotiate for the things they need, and open and run businesses. 

Alexander said the federal government 'should do what it can to encourage employers to offer paid sick leave' but should 'not impose a big new mandate' that he claims will 'cost employers $11.4 billion over five years and make it harder for them to hire new employees.'

Sen. Deb Fischer, a Republican from Nebraska, said employers should provide paid sick leave on a 'voluntary' basis. 

She and Maine Sen. Angus King, an Independent senator, have introduced legislation that would 'encourage' businesses to do just that by giving organizations that offer their employees at least four weeks of paid leave a tax credit.

Meanwhile, DeLauro and women's groups applauded the president's announcement.

'Workplaces need to respond to the reality of family life in the 21st century, and allowing employees to have seven sick days a year is a bare minimum,' DeLauro said. 

'The fact that the United States is one of just a handful of countries that does not require paid family or sick leave is nothing short of shameful.'

The chances that lawmakers will send DeLauro's bill to Obama in the next two years appear slim to none, given that the congresswoman first introduced the bill a decade ago.

But Debra L. Ness, president of the National Partnership for Women & Families, said the announcement amounts to the 'boldest action' in support of family-friendly workplace polices in a generation.

'This is fantastic news for workers, families and our economy,' she said.

Obama's actions follow up on a White House Summit on Working Families the president held last June in Washington, Jarrett said.

It is also the latest in a series of near-daily previews by Obama of initiatives geared toward the middle class and working families that he plans to highlight in next Tuesday's nationally televised State of the Union address. 

The White House said Thursday it would use the State of the Union to try to drum up support for the measure.
