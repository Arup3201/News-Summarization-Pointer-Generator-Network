Touching poems written by the families of those killed in the First World War and published alongside their death notices have been discovered.

The heartfelt prose was published in local newspapers at the time, as a way for families to express their grief for their loved ones when there was no body to mourn over.

Now an ancestry website has published a series of the poems - written by wives, parents, brothers, sisters and orphaned children  -  to 'bring home' the sorrow of the families and highlight the human suffering behind the Great War's 16 million deaths.

A poem published in a 1916 edition of the Dover Express shows how the family of 29-year-old Alfred Priest, from the 1st Battalion Rifle Brigade, tried to deal with their loss.

'Oh! How our hearts do ache,' the poem read.

'When we think of how you died. To think we could not say good-bye, when you closed your eyes.'

Other families spoke of the pain of not knowing where their loved one was buried, their reliance on religion to get them through the ordeal or the fear of carrying on life without them.

Private Harry Randall's family wrote in the Grantham Journal in 1917: 'His work is done, his toil is passed and he is fully blessed.

'He fought the fight, the victory won and entered into rest.

'But the hardest part is yet to come, when our heroes all return.

'And we miss, among the cheering crowds, the face of our own dear one.'

Myko Clelland, of the website behind the research Genes Reunited, said the site wants to look at the lives of those left behind during World War I.

'Too often we read of the 16 million who tragically lost their lives during the Great War without really understanding the grief that families went through,' Mr Clelland said.

'These "In Memoriam" poems bring home the pain and sorrow they experienced.'
