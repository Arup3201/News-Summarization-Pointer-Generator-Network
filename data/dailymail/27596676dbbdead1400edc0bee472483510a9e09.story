A shocking video has captured the heartbreaking moment a teenage boy is run over by a 20-ton bus while trying to hold it for his mother, leaving him fighting for his life.

Jerry Cunningham, 14, from Pompano Beach, Florida, is seen in the Broward County Transit surveillance footage sprinting to stop the bus as it begins to move away from the curb.

But the boy's arm gets caught in the automatic doors, and the driver, who is distracted chatting to other passengers, drags him along the road for a number of seconds and then underneath the bus.

Transit horror: This grab of the shocking footage shows Jerry Cunningham the moment before he is pulled under the bus

Cunningham suffered fractures to his face, ribs and ankle and has been in a medically induced coma at Broward Health Medical Center's pediatric ICU since the devastating May 10 incident, according to the Sun Sentinel.

The tragedy took place at around 9 a.m. in front of scores of horrified passengers, and was filmed by the Broward County Transit bus's security cameras, which cover eight angles.

Two of the angles captured the young boy as he gallantly ran towards the bus for his mother. After he gets his arm caught, he is seen sprinting for some seven seconds to keep up with the bus while banging on the door for attention with his other arm. He then disappears out of sight.

One woman can be seen and heard on the tape telling the diver, Reinaldo Soto, 55, that someone was running for the bus then several people yell at him to stop because the boy's arm was shut in the door.

When he slips out of sight, several passengers scream and one woman is seen hitting Soto as the bus stopped.

The driver and a group of passengers then rushed off the bus to help the boy with his mother who, by that point, had caught up with the bus.

Soto is seen rushing back to his radio to call for help.

Cunningham suffered fractures to his face, ribs and ankle and is in the pediatric care unit at Broward Health Medical Center, his family's attorney Elie Anidjar told the Sun Sentinel.

Soto, a 12-year veteran with the Transit authority, has been placed on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of an investigation by the Broward Sheriff's Office, which could see him face criminal charges.
