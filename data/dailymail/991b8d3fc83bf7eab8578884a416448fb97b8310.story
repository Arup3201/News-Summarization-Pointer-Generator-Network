Steven Gerrard blamed the crushing defeat against Uruguay on England’s gung-ho quest for a glorious winner in Sao Paulo and admitted it was time to pray for help from Italy.

Wayne Rooney scored his first World Cup goal to cancel out a first-half header by Luis Suarez but Liverpool’s Uruguayan striker settled the game in the 84th minute and left England teetering on the brink of an early exit.

'It is such a cruel level,' said Gerrard. 'You can’t give world class players chances – that’s one thing – and when you’re still in the game you need to be more difficult to beat. That was the disappointing thing for me.

'At 1-1 as a team we sort of went for the second goal and maybe we should have been more experienced and gone for the draw. It is a big learning curve today. It’s very tough at this moment.

'We never managed the game well enough when we got the equaliser. We can’t give chances to Luis Suarez because he buries them from that position. It’s a really tough moment for everyone in the dressing room but we need to be professional, keep fighting and pray for that score-line to go for us.

'It is frustrating. Looking at the two games and how we performed, we sort of deserved something out of either one of them if not both of them. I don’t think I’m standing here saying we were poor in both games and our game-plan was wrong.

'I just thought when we got the equaliser today we just needed to be a bit more clever, a bit more cute and a bit more difficult to beat. Maybe we should accept that going for a point might have been the best option. But they were weak at the back and they were there for the taking. Once we got the equaliser we tried to use the initiative to get the second.'

Suarez struck first with a header from a wonderful cross by Edinson Cavani in the 39th minute. Rooney equalised from close range after good work by Glen Johnson on the right and Suarez grabbed a late winner after Gerrard and his centre-halves failed to cut out a long ball.

'They were sloppy goals and we have to take responsibility for that as a team,' said the England captain. 'The first one he’s peeled off onto the back-post and it’s a fantastic ball by Cavani.

'The second one, I’ve gone to try and get good contact on the ball and I haven’t good enough contact on it and I’ve been punished for it.'

It his is third World Cup finals and Gerrard has felt this pain before, but he did not want to launch a full-scale inquest while England still have a slight hope of going through.

Italy victories against both Costa Rica and Uruguay and a 2-0 England win in their last game 2-0 against Costa Rica will put Hodgson’s team through to the next round. They will be out if Italy and Costa Rica draw on Friday.

'I need to park the hurt and see what happens over the next four or five days,' said Gerrard. 'If we go out in the group stage it will be a very personal low for myself and the team and I am sure everyone will feel very similar.

'Who knows? Italy are a fantastic team and capable of winning both games but we’re clutching at straws. The position we’re in is the position we didn’t want to be in coming into the tournament, relying on other people's results. It’s very difficult at the moment.

'We’ll have to wait and see what happens. The manager will have to wait and see what happens before deciding what he is going to do against Costa Rica. If there’s nothing to play for then I don’t know if he’ll play a completely different team.'

Suarez said he sought out his Liverpool captain after the game and told him to “keep going”, that he was 'one of the best' and should 'forget this game'. It just had to be Suarez, back after knee surgery; his first game for more than a month.

'It was no surprise,' said Gerrard. 'Everyone in the dressing room knows Luis Suarez inside out. We know what he's about. He's had two chances in the game and he's taken them both really well. That just goes to show. He hasn't played for five weeks and yet he comes back and is still as deadly as ever.'

As for his own international future, the England captain added: 'It's not the moment now.'
