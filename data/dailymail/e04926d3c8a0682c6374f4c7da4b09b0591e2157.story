A pilot killed in a light aircraft crash which also claimed the life of his partner was not carrying enough fuel to safely complete the flight, an accident report has found.

Pilot Gary Vickers, 58, and his passenger Kaye Clarke, 42, died after their Cessna aircraft crashed nose-down at Hawarden Airport near Chester in November 2013. 

The left engine of the aircraft, which Mr Vickers was flying from an aerodrome near Paris, lost power at a late stage of the approach due to fuel starvation, a report by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) stated.

Businessman Mr Vickers – whose father Gordon is a close friend of former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott – had in the weeks before the crash flown the light aircraft to the UK from his property in Andorra.

The couple had later flown out to Paris for a shopping trip. They had been planning to make the return flight the day before the crash, but were delayed by stormy weather.

The accident happened close to the Broughton factory of plane-making company Airbus UK.

The report into the crash stated: 'The majority of usable fuel at the time of the accident was in the auxiliary tanks, which were not selected for engine feed.

'From the available evidence it is probable that the pilot originally intended to complete the flight using fuel from the main tanks only, and loaded them with what he considered to be a sufficient quantity. However, the main fuel tank quantity was insufficient for safe completion of the flight.'

Accident investigators have now found that one of the plane's engines ran out of fuel before the accident

Relatives of Ms Clarke said the couple were 'devoted to each other' and Mr Vickers was a skilled pilot

The report said Mr Vickers died at the scene. Ms Clarke was rescued from the wreckage and taken to Chester hospital but died a short while later. Both were from the Chester area.

Ms Clarke's devastated mother, Angela, 66, later said: ‘They idolised each other and Gary would never have put Kaye’s life in danger. Gary was a gentleman.

‘My husband has been up with him in his plane, and his flying skills were spot on. They were absolutely devoted to each other.

'They went to pop festivals together and because he was older than her he used to joke “She’s dragging me there again”. But they really enjoyed the events together.’
