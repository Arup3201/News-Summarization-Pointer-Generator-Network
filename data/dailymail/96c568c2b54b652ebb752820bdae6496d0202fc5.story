Serena Williams was given the worst beating of her Grand Slam career in a sensational upset at the French Open today when she was beaten 6-2, 6-2 by 20 year-old Garbine Muguruza.

The six-feet tall world No 35, of Spanish and Venezuelan heritage, took advantage of windy and cold conditions to blow away the top seed in the second round and keep the shocks coming at Roland Garros.

The women’s draw has been blown wide open as, for the first time in the Open era, the top two seeds are out before the third round following Li Na’s early demise.

Disaster: Serena Williams suffered a huge upset as she was beaten by Garbine Muguruza in Paris

Thrashed: The No 1 seed and favourite was beaten 6-2, 6-2 by her Spanish opponent

Delighted: Muguruza celebrates her stunning victory on Court Suzanne Lenglen

Agony: Venus Williams was knocked out of the French Open by a teenage Slovakian Anna Schmiedlova

Realisation: Schmiedlova came from a set behind to knock out the No 29 seeded American

Flying start: Venus seemed to be cruising towards victory when she took the first set with minimal fuss

For the third time Serena and Venus 
Williams have gone out on the same day at a major, with Venus falling 
earlier to Anna Schmiedlova in a far less surprising result.

Muguruza
 has long been identified within tennis as one of the sport’s up and 
comers but this will give her a completely different profile.

Based in Barcelona, she is unlike many other Spanish female players 
with her considerable height and rangey strokes, which continually had 
Serena rocking back on her heels.

It
 means that there is already sure to be an unexpected champion this 
year, with Maria Sharapova and the resurgent Ana Ivanovic both sure to 
fancy their chances.
