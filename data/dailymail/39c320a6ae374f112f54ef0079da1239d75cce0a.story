Illegal and 'barbaric' traps being used to catch foxes in urban areas are so deadly they could kill or severely injure a child, experts warn.

The so-called 'gin traps' clamp down on the unsuspecting fox's legs, and are still being used despite them being banned in 1958.

Several traps have been discovered in Guildford, Surrey, and wildlife experts say they are strong enough to cut off a child's hand. 

Danger: A fox that has been caught in a 'gin trap' in Guildford, Surrey and had to be put down

The 'gin traps' horrendously maim the animals meaning they often must be put down said Wildlife Aid Foundation founder Simon Cowell.

Mr Cowell has now issued the stark warning after several foxes were found dying in the traps in Surrey.

He said: 'These traps are incredibly dangerous and would catch pets or even children - which is an incomprehensible thought.

'If a child puts its finger hand in the trap it would easily take a finger off if not a hand. Worse scenarios are unthinkable, it makes me cringe.

'People should not to approach the fox but call us, and if possible keep the fox in sight but from a distance, and we will get over there immediately.

'We also want people to keep an eye for any traps that may have been set and again don't touch but call us we need the evidence and need to catch the person responsible.'

There are an estimated 33,000 'urban foxes' in Britain, according to Bristol University research from 2013.

In London, where they have been known to make their way into houses in search for food, there are thought to be around 16 per square mile.
