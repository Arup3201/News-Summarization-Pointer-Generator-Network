Popular: Boxer Dale Lincoln, 21, from South Shields, had defended a regional title three years in a row

A talented boxer has been found dead after a member of the public saw a car dropping from the top of a cliff.

The alarm was sounded yesterday just two hours after the man was reported missing from his home in South Shields, South Tyneside.

A volunteer lifeboat crew found the body of a man, named locally as popular regional title winner Dale Lincoln, 21, along with a Citroen car near the beach in the suburb of Marsden.

The driver had been reported missing to Northumbria Police at 7.45am yesterday, a spokesman said.

The car was then seen falling from the top of the cliffs at 10am near the local Grotto pub.

Police, paramedics, fire crews, the coastguard and the RNLI attended the scene, but the driver was found dead.

A spokesman for Northumbria Police said: 'Police received a report that a car had gone over the cliffs at just after 10am.

'Emergency services were sent to the scene, where the driver of the car was found dead.

'It is believed to be linked to an earlier report of a missing person from South Shields. Officers have informed the next of kin and are providing support to them at this time.'

The car was lifted from the beach and recovered as part of the investigation.

Police are still investigating the circumstances around the death but said there is not thought to have been any third-party involvement.

A spokesman for Tynemouth RNLI added: 'The body was recovered by emergency services and the volunteer lifeboat crew took him to South Shields ferry landing, where they were met by funeral directors.'

Nicknamed The Kid, Mr Lincoln had successfully defended the regional Tyne Tees and Wear 57 kilo title for three years in a row.

In a tragic coincidence, he was the second member of South Shields' Horsley Hill Amateur Boxing Club to die in just three months.

Fellow fighter Grant Adams, 17, fatally cut his throat in June after falling onto a sunbed in a freak accident at his home.

Last week members of the club raised £3,500 for Grant's newborn daughter and the Great North Air Ambulance in his memory. The club's gym was shut yesterday as a mark of respect.

The cause of the latest death is still being investigated.

However, other people have died at the same range of cliffs, sparking renewed calls for more to be done to stop tragedies happening.

South Shields resident and campaigner Jean Costello, whose son Stephen Heslop took his own life at the same cliffs in 2007, said: 'There are too many deaths happening here.

'Someone, somewhere has to take a look at it. I don’t know what can be done, but surely there has to be something.

'My heart goes out to his family - it’s just a tragedy.'

There was also a death at the same range in July, when 26-year-old Karl Carson's body was found after he 'escaped' from a police vehicle near the clifftop where he was being held after an arrest.
