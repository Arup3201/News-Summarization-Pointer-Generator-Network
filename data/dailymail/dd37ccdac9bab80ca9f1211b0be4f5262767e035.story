A professional athlete and multi-award winning ironman who grew up in Queensland has added another trophy to his shelf.

Caine Eckstein broke not one but two Guinness World Records while on Monday, doing more than 4000 pull-ups over a 24-hour period.

The Australian ironman - a five time winner of the gruelling Coolangatta Gold challenge - broke the record in Times Square, New York.

The ironman completed 4210 pull-ups in 12 hours 

He pulled the first chin-ups live on the Today show, and paced himself over the course of the day.

Eckstein completed 4210 pull-ups edging past the previous 24-hour record of 4183 - and he did it in half the time. The athlete also inadvertently conquered the twelve hour record while he was at it.

Strategically spreading the pull-ups over each hour, by the two hour mark Eckstein had completed 70 chin-ups.

He beat the previous record of 4183 pull-ups in 24-hours

The muscle man finished the challenge in 12 hours, also inadvertently beating that record

He sat at 1440 after four hours, and 1800 by the time five had passed. Eckstein had pumped out 2520 by the time seven hours were up and after eight had gone by he had knocked over 2880.

By the time ten hours had rolled past the athlete had slowed to just five pull-ups a minute, making sure he was giving himself enough rest so he could get across the line.

After half a day of lifting his chin over the bar, Eckstein had tallied up 4210. His hands were ripped and blistered but he had broken two Guinness World Records.

Fox Sports reported that the ironman took the challenge to raise awareness about Corpus Callosum disorders, which presents itself in the form of a missing or absent connection between the two cerebral hemispheres in the brain.

Eckstein's best friend Larry's son suffers from one of these conditions and apparently sparked the athlete's determination for the world record. 

Jim Hunter and Celia Curtis also hold a record  on behalf of Australia - for the most watermelons chopped on the stomach in one minute.

According to the Guinness World Records on 16 August 2005: 'Jim Hunter chopped 25 watermelons on the stomach of Celia Curtis (both Australia) in one minute using a machete'.
