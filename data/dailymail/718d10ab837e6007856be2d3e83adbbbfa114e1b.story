The mother of a TV star who repeatedly punched a man in the face in an argument over his 27-year-old girlfriend has defended her son's actions, saying 'he's not a thug'.

MasterChef presenter Greg Wallace hit magazine publisher Paul Bates after he allegedly groped his girlfriend Anne-Marie Sterpini.

Now his mother Mary Pettman, 68, has said she is glad her son 'defended' Miss Sterpini and described him as a 'very caring man'.

Mrs Pettman, of Whitstable Kent, said reports about the fight 'made her son look like a thug, which he isn’t'.

'I’m sorry that it has given a lot of jealous and judgmental people a reason to pillory him,' she tweeted.

Wallace said he 'did what any bloke would do' after punching a diner 'at least five times' at an event at the four-star Wood Norton Hotel near Evesham, Worcestershire.

He started a drunken brawl with Paul Bates, a magazine publisher who the TV star claims also made 'inappropriate comments' to Anne-Marie Sterpini.

Wallace is said to have rained blows on the 55-year-old as they grappled on the floor in front of shocked guests at the £75-a-head event on Saturday evening.

But Mr Bates, who had taken his daughter to the the five-course dinner at a luxury Worcestershire hotel, accused the greengrocer of ‘turning on him out of the blue’.

Mrs Pettman cast doubt on the man's version of events, adding: 'Are we meant to believe that a totally blameless man was attacked for no reason, but refuses to involve the police? Something whiffs here.'

Miss Sterpini also defended the TV star, telling The Mirror: 'Gregg saw that I was close to tears and asked me what had happened.

'I told him and he reacted by shouting at the man and which then led to the fight. He was protecting me.'

Wallace faces a grilling by ‘very senior’ BBC staff after his recent, leaving his future on the popular cooking show, where he earns an estimated £250,000 a year, in doubt.

Last week it was reported that the hotel chain that hosted the event, a five hour feast called 'Dinner with Gregg Wallace' has dropped his restaurant from another of its luxury hotels.

The MasterChef judge will close Gregg’s Bar and Grill, in London’s Bermondsey Square Hotel, following a series of scathing reviews by critics who branded it a 'travesty' and a 'joke'.
