With Pippa Middleton, Jose Mourinho and girlfriend Kim Sears in attendance, Andy Murray might have put up more of a fight in his showdown against Roger Federer in the ATP World Tour quarter final.

Despite fans piling into the O2 arena to see the Scot take on Roger Federer, the defeat ended his season in just 24 minutes.

From the outset the 33-year-old Swiss looked strong against 27 year-old Murray, leaving his supporters Jose and Pippa looking unimpressed.

The Swiss won the first six games without reply from Murray and Pippa looking pensive as she watched the match with a friend.

Murray's long-term girlfriend Kim Sears tried to keep a brave face as her beau was defeated 6-0, 6-1. 

The World No 2 took just 55 minutes to secure a win over the Scot and book his place in the next round.

Murray has recently seen a return to form but the straight sets loss will leave him with a free weekend to contemplate his form, no doubt comforted by girlfriend Kim. 

The Scot had needed to win in straight sets to make it to the semi-finals.
