An epileptic hospital patient was forced to sleep on the floor for four weeks while he was waiting to have a scan on his brain.

Michael Collins was kept in a receiving ward, normally for short stays of no more than two days, after being admitted to the Royal Infirmary in Glasgow.

He hit his head during an epileptic seizure, making him prone to violent outbursts - so hospital staff removed his bed from the room and made him sleep on a mattress on the floor.

It took three weeks before Mr Collins, 54, was given a chair, and though he has now moved to another hospital he is still waiting for an MRI scan six weeks after the accident.

Hospital: Michael Collins had to spend four weeks in a room without a bed while waiting for a scan

Relatives of the former roofer, from Glasgow, are desperate to find out what is wrong with him, but until he has the scan - which will take around 45 minutes - they are still in the dark.

His partner Suzanne Brown, 50, said: 'We took him to A&E at the Royal and he was kept in overnight.

'He had another fit the next morning so they kept him in for another few days. But a couple of days later he walked out of the hospital at 3.30am.

'He threw all his medication away and walked out dressed only in his slippers, pyjamas and housecoat.

'Clearly, mentally he was not right. Before he banged his head he was fine. He had no mental health issues whatsoever.'

Precaution: Mr Collins had to sleep on a mattress on the floor after he behaved violently

Waiting: He did not even get a chair in the room for his first three weeks in hospital

Ms Brown initially took Mr Collins to the GP after he hit his head, and was then referred to A&E.

'We waited seven hours in casualty,' she said. 'Then he was put in a receiving ward. You are supposed to be there for a maximum of two days.

'He was supposed to be going to the Southern to get an MRI scan and a lumbar puncture but they cancelled his appointments three times.

'They're sedating him because of his outburst in the waiting room but he's not that kind of man. It's terrible to see him like this.

'I know there is something wrong with his brain. If they would just give him the scan we could find out what is the matter with him.

'I thought they would at least have given him a bed with cot sides so he couldn't get out or do himself an injury.

'When he went in at first he was quite violent, throwing things about, so they took everything out of his room.

'He keeps going back to when he was a boy and still thinks his mum and dad are alive.'

Ms Brown praised the way doctors and nurses looked after Mr Collins before he was moved to the Southern General Hospital, but criticised the NHS for failing to treat him promptly.

A spokesman for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said: 'The patient presented with extremely challenging behaviour and for his own protection and personal safety had to be nursed with only a mattress in his room.

'We accept there were delays in transferring him to the Southern General. We also accept a delay in providing the appropriate tests which need to be undertaken with specialist clinical input.

'These have now been arranged to be undertaken this week.'
