Arrested: ASU student Andrew Kent, 21, was arrested today after allegedly throwing vodka into a fire, causing it to explode and burn two partygoers

A college student has been arrested after he was accused of throwing a bottle of vodka into a bonfire, which then exploded and caught two of the partygoers on fire.

Andrew Kent, a 21-year-old Arizona State University junior, allegedly threw a bottle of vodka into a bonfire at a party where multiple members of the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity were in attendance.

The burning liquid splashed onto a 17-year-old girl from California and an 18-year-old ASU student, badly burning their legs and shoulders.

The Arizona Republic reports that the 17-year-old girl was visiting the campus for a college recruitment event and was invited to the off-campus house party on Saturday night.

According to witnesses, the party attracted hundreds of students, and people were standing shoulder-to-shoulder.

Authorities said that while the girls managed to extinguish the flames, they believe that the girls were sent home from the party so those hosting it would not get in trouble.

The 17-year-old suffered burns on her thighs, and was treated at a nearby hospital for severe burns.

Meanwhile, the ASU student went home and was treated for her burns by her firefighter father, later going to a hospital herself.

Police in Tempe acquired a warrant to search the house, and later arrested Kent, who was booked on two counts of aggravated assault and two counts of endangerment.

ABC 15 obtained footage of the 17-year-old’s legs, which show severe burns up and down her thighs and calves. 

Authorities said that many people at the party were under legal drinking age.
