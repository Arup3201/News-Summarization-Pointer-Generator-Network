A 18-month-old boy has been dubbed a 'miracle baby' after surviving a highway rollover crash which killed his mother and seriously injured another passenger.

Little Riley was strapped in a safety seat in the middle of the backseat when his 21-year-old mother, Lindsey Michelle Woods, lost control of her Jeep and swerved off the Interstate 8 in Alpine, San Diego on Wednesday evening.

The vehicle plunged 150-feet down an embankment before rolling, killing Woods, a single mom, and leaving a 21-year-old man with life-threatening injuries. Riley miraculous escaped with only a few minor scrapes.

'The baby was calm. The baby was healthy,' witness Terry Ulmer told NBC San Diego. 'The baby seemed intact and pretty responsive.'

Family members who visited the crash site said they couldn't believe that Riley survived.

Woods's brother, Jonny DeWitt, credited the safety seat for saving his nephew's life and wanted his sister's story to serve as a warning to other families.

'I didn’t realize how severe it was until I got here,' he told NBC San Diego.

'I would definitely say I am in complete disbelief and there’s only one reason, and that is that God has a plan for [Riley’s] life and I’m going to raise him to be that way – to look to God – because there is a reason why he was spared.

'If you really love your kid, buckle him in. Lives can be spared.'

DeWitt said his sister was a great mother to Riley after she 'turned her life around'.

'She started doing everything right (after Riley was born). She was my baby sister,' he said.

'She was struggling [to raise him] on her own, and making the best life for her kid. She read to him, gave him a bath every night and made sure he was in a warm house every night.'

DeWitt and other families are caring for the little boy.

 Highway Patrol officials said Woods was driving at high-speed on the I-8 about 5.30pm Wednesday.

Witnesses said that when the Jeep approached a slow-moving vehicle, Woods, the driver, slammed on the brakes and lost control of the vehicle.

It rolled down an embankment, trapping the trio inside.

Police said Woods succumbed to her injuries at the scene, while a male passenger - described as an 'acquaintance' - was rushed to the Sharp Memorial Hospital by Mercy
 Air with major arm and chest injuries.

Witness Terry Ulmer said he comforted the man at the scene: 'I asked him where it was hurting. He 
was telling me it was a right arm, left arm, his chest, he was bleeding 
from his chest and the top of his arm.'

Scene: Woods was traveling eastbound on I-8 at about 70 mph when it swerved off the freeway and onto an embankment below

Scene: Police say Woods was speeding as she approached a slow-moving vehicle, forcing her to slam on the brakes. She lost control of the vehicle and plunged down the embankment

CHP officials said speed was the cause of the rollover.

The deadly accident remains under investigation, and officials do not believe alcohol or drugs contributed to the crash.

'Definitely an excess of the speed limit, the witnesses didn't have an exact speed but they were definitely passing all of the vehicles,' CHP Sgt. Jim McNamara said.
