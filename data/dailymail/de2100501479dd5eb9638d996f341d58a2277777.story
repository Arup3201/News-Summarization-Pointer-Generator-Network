Nigeria's military knows where the more than 200 girls abducted by Boko Haram are but has ruled out using force to rescue them, the state news agency quoted Chief of Defence Staff Air Marshal Alex Badeh as saying on Monday.

'The good news for the parents of the girls is that we know where they are, but we cannot tell you,' Badeh was quoted as saying.

'But where they are held, can we go there with force? We can't kill our girls in the name of trying to get them back.'

More than 200 girls were snatched from their school five weeks ago by Boko Haram, a terrorist group linked to Al-Qaeda.

The girls have been tracked to three camps in the north of Nigeria, near Lake Chad, 200 miles from where they were abducted, senior officials told a Nigerian newspaper on Friday.

150 people were killed in bomb and gun attacks by the militants across the country last week.

On Tuesday night a double car bombing in a market in the central city of Jos killed at least 130 civilians, while two days later another 48 died when militants stormed and burned settlements near Chibok.

Boko Haram  leader Abubakar Shekau offered to trade the girls for the release of prisoners, which was declined by the Nigerian government

Boko Haram released a video two weeks ago showing some of the abducted girls in veils and reciting from the Qu’ran, and claimed they had converted to Islam.

Their leader Abubakar Shekau offered to trade the girls for the release of prisoners, which was declined by the Nigerian government.

Boko Haram's leaders had been threatening to sell the girls as brides for as little as £12, or force them to work in the sex trade if their demands were not met.

Nigeria's President Goodluck Jonathan 
and his government are confronting national and international outrage at
 their failure to rescue the abducted girls.

Thousands
 have been killed in the five-year-old Islamic uprising that aims to turn 
Nigeria into an Islamic state, though the country's population is almost
 equally divided between a mainly Muslim north and predominantly 
Christian south.
