New role? Sajid Javid could be set for a cabinet role in David Cameron's reshuffle

A Tory MP who has been tipped as a future Chancellor is in line for rapid advancement in a Government reshuffle this week.

Treasury Minister Sajid Javid, the son of a bus driver, will be given a senior ministerial job at ‘the door of the Cabinet’ by David Cameron, as the Prime Minister hands out promotions to the brightest members of the 2010 intake of Tory MPs.

Comprehensive-educated Mr Javid, 43, has only been in the Commons since 2010.

But the Muslim former banker, who is politically close to George Osborne, has impressed colleagues as a junior Treasury Minister and is seen as a safe pair of hands both in the Commons and in media interviews.

One of five sons, Mr Javid was born in Rochdale, Lancashire, but brought up in a crime-ridden area of Bristol.

He became a vice-president of Chase Manhattan Bank at just 25 and later a director of Deutsche Bank.

But, inspired by Margaret Thatcher’s premiership, Mr Javid, who is married with four children, gave up banking to focus on politics.

His wife Laura is a Christian, sparking Mr Javid to say last year: ‘She goes to church more often than I go to mosque.’

The Prime Minister is being urged by advisers to promote women, ethnic minority MPs, northern MPs and those from less affluent backgrounds.

The drive follows findings by focus groups that the party is still regarded as a bastion for white, middle-class, southern males.

Speculation that a reshuffle was imminent heightened on Friday when Rail Minister Simon Burns quit – to fight for the vacant post of Commons Deputy Speaker – and was not immediately replaced.

Labour leader Ed Miliband is also expected to carry out a reshuffle this week, with Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury Rachel Reeves backed to replace Liam Byrne as Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary.

Douglas Alexander is expected to keep his job as Shadow Foreign Secretary, but also be handed the job of the party’s campaign co-ordinator, succeeding Tom Watson.
