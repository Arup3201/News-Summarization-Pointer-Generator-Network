A tiny shack on the Manhattan Bridge where a 57-year-old homeless man has lived for a year has today been ripped down by New York police.

A dozen officers wearing helmets and brandishing hammers raided the home on Thursday morning and broke up the man's coffin-sized shack, which he had built from flimsy wood.

Officers tore up the wood and pulled down his belongings, including pots, bedsheets, clothing and even electrical items, before dumping them in an overflowing truck.

The man, who previously told MailOnline his name
 was Joey, was taken to the Bellevue Men's Shelter in Midtown Manhattan, an NYPD spokesman said today.

The NYPD said that 'Joey', whose full name was not revealed, asked for the contents of his makeshift home to be thrown away. He also refused any medical attention.

For
 a year, the man had managed to quietly come and go from his home on the
 cyclists' side of the New York City landmark, which connects Manhattan 
and Brooklyn.

But his hideaway was discovered last month after a
 cyclist called 911 saying he thought the man was trying to commit suicide -
 when he was actually climbing into the safe confines of his tiny home.

The NYPD said that the home had to be demolished because it was dangerous for Joey and for those who use the cycle path of the bridge.

MailOnline spoke to him at the home earlier this week and, speaking in heavily-accented English, he offered up his name as Joey and said that he arrived in New York City from China 13 years ago.

When asked where he had lived in China 
before arriving in the United States, middle-aged Joey said that he had 
worked in Shanghai, but had left to try and find a better life in the 
United States.

Claiming to have suffered a financial loss through gambling, Joey said that for the past year he had called the Manhattan Bridge his home - constructing the base between the girders using wood discarded from nearby Chinatown.

Indeed, dotted around the shack built into the bridge was evidence of his shanty construction - wooden boards and used water bottles litter the area.

Joey said that there were others who 
lived in or near to the bridge - including one woman who had moved her 
worldly possessions off the cycling ramp to the entrance of of the famous structure finished in 1912.

Surprisingly 
well dressed for a man who lives in a bridge, Joey said that the brutal 
winter that New York and the nation just experienced was difficult to 
endure.

He also said that he was working on a second 
shack just 15-feet up the ramp from his current abode. Each of the cramped homes were around ten feet-by-one-and-a-half feet and seemed to be protected with bike locks.

The
 tiny, narrow dwellings were just big enough for one person to lie down.
 The living spaces also provided little silence as loud subway trains 
rumbled by on four different tracks, 24 hours a day.

Emerging: The man who lived in the shack said his name was Joey. He is pictured by his home this week

Looking inside: Water bottles and wooden planks litter the area where 'Joey' built his home on the bridge

Daylight: Earlier this week, 'Joey' explained that he has been coming and going from the home for a year. But a passerby saw him climbing into the home and thought he was committing suicide, so called the cops

Heading home: 'Joey' headed back to his shack to replace his umbrella after it stopped raining

The spot was also poorly lit and well-trafficked with bikers who speed past, not expecting to see a pedestrian on this side of the bridge.

Joey likely picked the spot because 
it is part of a short expanse of the bike path where there is a roof. 
There is also no roof over the pedestrian walkway.

Last
 Sunday a cyclist saw Joey climbing to his rustic nook and mistook him 
for a jumper, calling 911 to report what he thought was an impending 
suicide.

The NYPD 
declined to comment to MailOnline regarding the dwellings, and the 
Department of Transportation has yet to return a message left seeking 
comment.
