A British multi-millionaire entrepreneur who was accused of possessing cocaine after being arrested in a U.S. nightclub has accepted an offer to carry out community service instead of going on trial.

Mary Gorman, wife of former Gadget Shop chairman Chris Gorman, was also alleged to to have lashed out at a police officer following the incident in the toilets at Roxy in Orlando, Florida, on August 13 last year.

Her lawyer confirmed that she would not stand trial, and dismissed as 'incorrect and totally wrong' reports, apparently sourced from legal papers at the time, that she had been arrested after allegedly performing a sex act on another man while her husband watched.

The sexual allegations were not included on the charge sheet, but Mrs Gorman had faced up to 10 years in jail if found guilty of the drugs and violence offences after a trial.

The move is the latest development in an embarrassing saga for the Gormans, who live in a £2million home in Renfrewshire, Scotland, and are believed to have an estimated £45million fortune.

Mr Gorman was also arrested following the nightclub incident, but a misdemeanour charge against him - for allegedly 'interfering' with police who arrested his wife - was dropped at Orange County Court in Florida last year.

The couple, who have four children, had been at a hip-hop night at the club while on a family holiday to Disney World.

Mrs Gorman's lawyer, Mark Horwitz, said she had agreed to a 'pretrial diversion' offer from the State Attorney's Office, which will mean the case against her is dismissed after she has completed community service.

He said she had accepted a similar offer previously, only for the opportunity to be withdrawn by the authorities.

In a statement, Mr Horwitz said: 'The State Attorney's Office has again offered to resolve the case against Mary Gorman through her participation in the Pretrial Diversion Program.

'Mrs Gorman has accepted the State's offer and will be meeting with a representative of pretrial diversion in the near future. A specific date for the initial meeting has not yet been set.

'The Pretrial Diversion Program is a frequently used method of resolving criminal cases.

'The State Attorney's Office and not the court decides when and in what cases to offer pretrial diversion to defendants.'

Mr Horwitz said the scheme usually required defendants to do charity work.

He added: 'In Mrs Gorman's case, she was previously offered pretrial diversion but before Mrs Gorman could meet with the pretrial diversion personnel, the State Attorney's Office withdrew the offer.

'The offer to resolve the case 
through pretrial diversion was again recently put forth by the State 
Attorney's Office and Mrs Gorman again accepted.

'Upon
successful completion of pretrial diversion, which does not involve an 
admission of guilt, the case against Mrs Gorman will be dismissed by the
State.'

Mr Horwitz said reports of a sexual nature about Mrs Gorman's actions in the nightclub were untrue.

He said: 'I believe the basis for the sensational reporting of sexual activity is the arrest affidavit filed in this case.

'In
a statement given to me and the prosecutor in this case, the arresting 
officer stated that the references in his affidavit concerning sexual 
activity are incorrect and not true.

'In fact, he never saw Mrs Gorman participating in any sex act, nor did he see any sexual organs exposed as related in the arrest affidavit.'

Mr Gorman, originally from Hartlepool, County Durham, made his millions in technology companies such as mobile phone retailer DX Communications and internet services firm Reality Group.

He was also the former executive chairman of the Gadget Shop chain and was awarded an OBE in 2005.

He played an active role in the high-profile Make Poverty History campaign that year.

Mr Gorman's company, DX Communications, whose turnover grew from £100,000 to £70million in the late 1990s, was sold for £42 million.

He later established and sold Reality Group in a £35million deal.

Mrs Gorman describes herself as a 'creative entrepreneur' with business interests in technology, music, beauty and the creative industries.
