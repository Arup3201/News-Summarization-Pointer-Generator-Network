Former Olympic champion and convicted drugs cheat Justin Gatlin has been handed a new sponsorship deal by Nike, sparking outrage in the Athletics world.

The 33-year-old was the fastest man in the world last year, but few expected him to be handed such a lucrative contract after twice being banned for doping.

And several British athletes, including Paula Radcliffe, who is also sponsored by the sports goods company, hit out at the decision.

Gatlin was the fastest man in the world last yea, but his new deal has sparked controversy

'I am very disappointed to hear this news,' Radcliffe wrote on Twitter. 

'I don't believe it truly reflects the core values of the NIKE that I am poud to represent, nor the integrity and ideals of the people there that I work with on a daily basis.'

Olympic silver medalist Steve Backley questioned Nike's message to young athletes, while former heptathlete Kelly Sotherton also hit out at the deal.

'What sort of a message is that from #Nike signing new sponsorship with multiple drug cheat Justin Gatlin? #DrugCheatsOut' wrote Backley on Twitter.

The American sprinter has won Olympic gold, but his two drugs bans have made him a controversial figure

Sotherton tweeted: 'What inspiration does Justin Gatlin give up & coming athletes @nike? Take drugs, get caught twice and sign a shoe contract?! #Doping #cheat'.

Gatlin was banned for a maximum of eight years by the United States Anti-Doping Agency after testing positive for testosterone at the Kansas Relays in Lawrence in 2006 - his second failed drugs test. 

He served a four-year ban after appeal to arbitration and - after his return to the sport in 2010 - he ran the fastest 100 metres in the world in last year as he clocked 9.77 seconds to claim a dominant victory at the Memorial van Damme in Brussels last September.
