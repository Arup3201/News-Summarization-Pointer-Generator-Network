The dress code for this party in New York was brief.

Crowds were invited to descend on Times Square wearing nothing but their underwear yesterday.

Hundreds of exhibitionists with boxer shorts, briefs and bras on full display flocked to the tourist hotspot, as part of an attempt to break the record for the largest number of people in one place wearing only their underpants.

Timed to coincide with National Underwear Day yesterday, organisers had hoped to smash the current Guinness World Record of 2,270 people - set at the Utah Undie Run in 2011.

Among those showing some skin at the event was New York's famous Naked Cowboy - who spends every day striding around Times Square in just his pants.

Yesterday he had to compete for attention with the crowds of bare-chested men and scantily clad women who crammed the area.

Despite the sea of people in boxers and briefs in New York yesterday, the Utah record remains intact.

Organisers of the Freshpair-sponsored event said just over 800 people had gathered in Times Square, and said of the record attempt: 'We'll get it next year.'

People of all ages, shapes and sizes turned out to flash the flash - including an elderly couple who pulled on pants over their shorts to join in the dancing.
