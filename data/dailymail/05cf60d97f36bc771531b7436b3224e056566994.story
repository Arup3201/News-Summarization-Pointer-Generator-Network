A 100-year-old woman says the secret to her youth is her toyboy husband - who is 33 years her junior.

Daisy Dunnett was already married with three children before her second husband David, 67, was even born.

When her first husband died after 50 years of marriage, Daisy thought she would never find love again.

What's in a number? Daisy Dunnett, 100, says the secret to her youth is her toyboy husband Dave, who is 33 years younger than her

But at the age of 72 she met David and after nine years of courtship, he proposed. They married on her 82nd birthday.

Now the inseparable couple - who live in Diss, Norfolk - say they could not live without each other, with Daisy crediting her youthful outlook on life to her younger man.

And even though David's three stepchildren are older than him, the pair insist the age gap has never been an issue - and that they still enjoy a busy and active lifestyle.

London-born Daisy married childhood sweetheart Frank Pitchers when she was 22.

They were together for 50 years and had three children together.

So in love: At the age of 72, Daisy met David and after nine years of courtship, he proposed - and they wed on her 82nd birthday

Youthful: The inseparable pair say they could not live without each other, with Daisy crediting her youthful outlook on life to her younger man

Frank died from emphysema when Daisy was 72 and the former shop assistant was convinced she would spend the rest of her life alone.

But then only a few months later David, a local carpenter, moved in to the same block of flats in Attleborough, Norfolk, and the pair started dating.

Daisy, who has three children John, 78, Susan, 75, and Rosemary, 72 and three grandchildren Martin, Anthony and Nicole and is also a great-grandmother to Fraya, 14, Charlie, one, and 15-month old, said: 'David offered to cut my lawn for me - he was the perfect gentleman from the start.

'Then everything went from there. I would offer to make him a cup of coffee or he would say do you want to come round for a drink.

'I thought he seems like a nice chap and so a romance started.

Doting: The pair insist the age gap has never been an issue - and that they still enjoy a busy and active lifestyle together going on plenty of trips abroad

'I thought I would never find love again after Frank died but David just happened to come into my life. It was wonderful.

'I wouldn't have been alive if I'd been a lonely widow I wouldn't have cooked for myself or anything like that.'

After nine years of dating, David proposed and the happy couple have been married for 18 years.

David, who was in his 40s when he met Daisy and had not previously been married, said: 'I was just a local lad looking for a partner when I found Daisy.

'We had been together for a little while and I didn't know what to get Daisy for her birthday so I just said "Why don't we get married" so we did.

'We had a lovely service on Daisy's 82nd birthday.'

Young at heart: Daisy was already married with three children before David was even born but they have a great life together and she does a daily crossword to keep her mind active

The pair are keen holidaymakers and have visited numerous countries including Canada, Egypt and Portugal and they regularly enjoy days out to beach-side town Great Yarmouth.

David says Daisy is still as sharp as ever and always does the daily crossword.

He said: 'She's just like she has always been. She's very sharp. We enjoy days out together all the time.

'Her legs aren't that good anymore, but apart from that she's fine.

'The age gap has never been an issue with us. We always just loved each other and that was all that mattered.'
