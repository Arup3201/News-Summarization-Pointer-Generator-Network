Wolfsburg midfielder Kevin de Bruyne is a transfer target for Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich.

The former Chelsea man has been in sensational form this season, bagging nine goals and 17 assists in 26 appearances while helping steer Wolfsburg to second in the German league.

De Bruyne is contracted to Wolfsburg until 2019 but, according to newspaper Sport Bild, Bayern are keeping tabs on the Belgian as Pep Guardiola's side look to line up a long-term successor to Arjen Robben, who is out of contract in 2017.

Bild also report that Bayern may wait until the summer of 2016 to make a move for De Bruyne, who they believe is currently worth around £35million on current form.

Meanwhile, De Bruyne's Wolfsburg team-mate Marcel Schafer has urged the 23-year-old to stay for at least another season.

He told reporters: 'I think that our chances [of keeping De Bruyne] are really good. He has already experienced not getting so much time on the field at Chelsea, a top club in Europe.

Jose Mourinho deemed De Bruyne surplus to requirements at Stamford Bridge last year

'And that is why I think the best thing for him would be to stay for minimum one more year at Wolfsburg. Next year he could play Champions League here and win titles with us.

'If you want to win titles you need extraordinary players. And you really have to say that Kevin de Bruyne is at the moment the best player in the Bundesliga not only because of his stats. You can see that in every single game. And we're really, really happy to have him and to keep him until next season or maybe a little bit longer.'
