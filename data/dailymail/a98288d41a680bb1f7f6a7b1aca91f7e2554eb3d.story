From leather leggings to trophy trousers, trends for our legs come and go.

But the one that works the hardest in most girl's wardrobes and looks set to stay for 2013 and beyond is trusty denim.

New Look  is one of the biggest denim destinations on the high street, selling one pair of jeans every five seconds, and to celebrate the store has commissioned a fashion film inspired by original denim brand Levi's.

Recreation: New Look have recreated the 1985 Levi's jean commercial with a modern day version starring Rihanna's ex Dudley O'Shaughnessy

Stripping off: Dudley can be seen stripping off into just his boxers in the steamy video

The brand has recreated the classic Levi's 501 laundrette commercial from the 1980s casting model, actor and Rihanna's ex Dudley O'Shaughnessy in the role originally played by a smouldering Nick Kamen.

As with the original shrink-to-fit campaign from 1985 the video shows Dudley entering a laundrette and stripping off to just his boxers to 
put his jeans in the wash - much to the delight of the females in the 
waiting area who he then joins on the bench.

Dudley, who starred in Rihanna's steamy We Found Love video and was rumoured to be playing her love interest off screen as well is a champion boxer from Hackney and also 
one of the faces of United Colours of Bennetton's latest campaign.

Impressed: His female fans in the video seem most impressed by his finely honed body

Original: Levi's original 501 commercial with Nick Kamen aired in 1985

Remember me? Dudley was hand-picked by Rihanna to star as her love interest in her We Found Love music video

New Look are proud of their vast denim range and this year have already launched the 'Shaper' Jean and the £9.99 jean and are they are soon launching a reversible jean.

The store sells enough jeans every Saturday to fill every seat in the huge O2 arena (20,000) and teh number of jeans sold in the last year would stretch from London to the North Pole if laid end to end.

The power of denim: Jeans are a fail safe option for the likes of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, the Duchess of Cambridge and Rihanna of course included several designs in her new collection for River Island

Sell out: New Look sell one pair of jeans every five seconds and constantly update their designs

A new season means a spring clean for lots of brands and online fashion site ASOS.com are another company to deliver a stylish new selection of denim.

This week they launched their new denim range featuring five new cuts, new names and new washes.

Denim bandwagon: Asos have gone crazy for denim too and unveiled five new designs including the Ridley, the Elgin, the Brady, the Saxby, and the Lennox
