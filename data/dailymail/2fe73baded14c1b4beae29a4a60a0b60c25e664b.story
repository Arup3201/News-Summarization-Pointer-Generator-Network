Terryl Gene Peters Sr, 67, also was sentenced on Friday after raping a seven-year-old girl in Arizona

The husband of former U.S. Transportation Secretary Mary Peters has been sentenced to 14 years in prison for raping a seven-year-old girl.

Terryl Gene Peters Sr, 67, also was sentenced on Friday to lifetime probation for one count of child molestation and two counts of attempted child molestation, according to Maricopa County prosecutors.Â 

Peters pleaded guilty to one count of molestation of a child and two counts of attempted molestation.

Peters, of Peoria, Arizona, was accused of sexually abusing the child in April 2008.

The allegation was reported to police in June 2012.

Prosecutors say the victim's mother 
called Terryl Peters to confront him in a recorded phone call, and he 
admitted having sex with the girl.

He was arrested in June 2012 following an investigation.

Mary Peters, 64, served as the nation's transportation secretary from October 2006 until January 2009 as part of George W Bush's administration.

At the time of her appointment, Bush said: 'Mary is a dedicated public servant, an experienced leader, and one of our Nation's most innovative thinker on transportation issues.'

In her role, she was in charge of more than 60,000 employees and managed a $70.3 billion annual budget.

She considered a run for the Arizona governor's post in 2006 but ultimately decided against it.

There was speculation surrounding Mrs
 Peters for governor in 2010 but instead she acted as co-chair of 
incumbent governor Jan Brewer's election campaign.

The 64-year-old now works as a transportation consultant for national engineering and planning organizations.

She has advocated for leasing U.S. roads and interstates to private companies, a stand that has made her unpopular with labor union.
