Thai authorities have fined an Australian holidaymaker who drunkenly stuffed two raw prawns into his pocket at a seafood restaurant on the picturesque island of Phuket.

These embarrassing snaps show the moment 27-year-old Jacob Saveisberg was forced to pose with police officers after his arrest.

In one of the photos, Mr Saveisberg points at the tiger prawns as they are held by an officer, while two other photos show an officer dangling the crustaceans in front of the tourist’s face.

A restaurant employee and police officers pursued Mr Saveisberg through the streets of Patong after he stole the prawns early Saturday morning, Phuketwan reported.

He was arrested on a party street and taken to a police station, where officers found the prawns in his pocket.

A police officer told the Thai website that the theft occurred as Mr Saveisberg walked along a beach road where the Tropica Bungalow Hotel’s restaurant displays its seafood for passers-by.

Another officer, Lt Thongpael Khurhom, told the Phuket Gazette: ‘He was taken to the Patong Police Station, where he confessed that he stole the prawns because he was very drunk.’

Jacob Saveisberg avoided a charge of theft and was fined 500 baht  for being drunk and disorderly

Because the restaurant did not file a formal complaint police decided not to charge him with theft, which carries a jail sentence and higher fine for those convicted.

Instead police handed him a fine of 500 baht (AUS$20 or £10) for being drunk and disorderly, and allowed him to leave.

Restaurant manager Aruni Mahasena, quoted by the Phuket Gazette, told the police: ‘The man walked through our restaurant and took two prawns.

Our staff asked him to put them back, but he refused and then disappeared onto Soi Bangla.’
