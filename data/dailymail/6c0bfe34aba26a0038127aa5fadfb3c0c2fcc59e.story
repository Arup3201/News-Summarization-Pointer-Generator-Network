He is believed to have died after shooting himself in a Berlin bunker in 1945 when he realised Germany had lost World War II.

But a startling new book claims Adolf Hitler actually escaped his hideout and died incognito in 1984 in a small town near Brazil's border with Bolivia - and it can be proved by a picture.

Not only that, but the author believes the Fuhrer fled to Argentina and then Paraguay before settling in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso to hunt for buried treasure - with a map given to him by Vatican allies, according to its author.

Simoni Renee Guerreiro Dias claims this picture proves Hitler lived in the small town of Nossa Senhora do Livramento with his girlfriend, Cutinga

Old clothes meant to be worn by the Fuhrer: An author claims the fascist actually died aged 95

German Fuhrer Adolf Hitler 'went to Brazil to hunt for treasure'

As part of his elaborate ruse to 
escape detection, he also had a relationship with a black woman called 
Cutinga, which was meant to prove that he could not be the dictator who 
hated anyone who did not fit his Aryan ideal, the book claims.

Post-graduate
 student Simoni Renee Guerreiro Dias has outlined her bizarre 
theory, claiming the fascist actually died aged 95.

The
 book, titled 'Hitler in Brazil - His Life and His Death', challenges 
the accepted view that the dictator shot himself in his Berlin bunker on
 April 30 1945.

She claims 
he may have lived as Adolf Leipzig in the small town of Nossa Senhora do
 Livramento, 30 miles from the state capital Cuiaba.

Simoni, a Brazilian who comes from Cuiaba, says Leipzig was known locally as the 'Old German.'

Simoni is now planning to use DNA tests using a relative of Hitler living in Israel, after been given permission to exhume Adolf Leipzig's remains from his alleged final resting place in Nossa Senhora do Livramento.

The journalism student has linked the Fuhrer's alleged arrival in the area to a Vatican offer of ownership rights over buried Jesuit treasure in a cave near his adopted home.

She points out in her book Leipzig was the birthplace of Hitler's favourite composer Bach.

She says her suspicions about Adolf Leipzig increased after she photoshopped a moustache on to the grainy picture she obtained of him and compared it to photos of the Nazi leader.

According to Simoni, an unidentified 
Polish nun recognised an elderly man due to have an op at a hospital in 
Cuiaba in the early eighties as Hitler and demanded he leave - but was 
reprimanded by a superior who claimed he was there on Vatican orders.

Academics in Brazil have also rubbished the theory Hitler lived and died in Nossa Senhora do Livramento.

Conspiracy theorists have long argued Hitler escaped from Germany and fled to south America.

Authors
 Gerrard Williams and Simon Dunstan claimed in a 2011 book Grey Wolf: 
The Escape of Adolf Hitler, that the Fuhrer fled with his mistress Eva 
Braun to Patagonia and had two daughters before dying in 1962 aged 73.

The
 claims about Hitler's life in Argentina were ridiculed by historian Guy
 Walters, who described them as '2,000 per cent rubbish' when the book 
was published.

He added: 
'It's an absolute disgrace. There's no substance to it at all. It 
appeals to the deluded fantasies of conspiracy theorists and has no 
place whatsoever in historical research.' 

Candido Moreira Rodrigues, a history professor at Mato Grosso's Federal University said: 'There's nothing new in people who claim to be historians coming up with the most far-reaching theories about Hitler supposedly living in south America and subsequently dying in one of the countries in this region.'

Ten of thousands of Nazis escaped after the war, including the notorious Adolf Eichmann and Josef Mengele.

Investigators probing Hitler's demise were hampered by the lack of any physical evidence for his death.

Fantasists were given added ammunition he didn't die in his Berlin bunker when 2009 DNA tests on skull fragments found near the bunker, believed to be his, turned out to belong to a woman.

Rochus Misch, a former bodyguard of Adolf Hitler who has been named as the last man to see the Fuhrer alive during his final hours in Germany, died last September aged 96.

Misch, who lived with Hitler and his mistress in their underground refuge as the allies closed in, told before his death he saw Hitler slumped with his head on the table after hearing a gunshot behind his closed door.
