Ambulance chiefs were accused last night of risking patients’ lives to meet response time targets.

One trust may have hastened the deaths of dozens of desperately ill people by downgrading emergency call-outs to non-urgent. 

This freed them from hitting a response time target of eight minutes.

Ambulance trusts have been accused of reclassifying call-outs to free them from response time targets

East of England Ambulance Service admits that 8,324 patients had their cases reclassified in this way in a two-month period last year.

At least 57 were not taken to hospital and died. Some of those downgraded had a terminal illness or a ‘do not resuscitate’ order.

It emerged last night that another major ambulance trust – Yorkshire – is also suspected of recategorising thousands of urgent cases.

Managers made the calls ‘non-urgent’ when they realised ambulances were not going to reach patients inside the eight-minute window.

Denise Burke, of the Norfolk-based campaign group Action on Ambulances, said: ‘They are playing Russian roulette with patients’ lives.

‘What is most shocking with East Anglia is the way patients who were near the end of life were treated. They were deciding on patients’ quality of life and whether they died then or in dignity a few months later.

'A lot of pressure': Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the number of ambulances dispatched within eight minutes had increased by 22 per cent this year

‘Any of those families will be questioning whether their loved ones’ lives could have been extended by a few months.’

Paramedics say they are so overstretched they often rely on firemen and police officers to take patients to hospital. 

NHS figures last week showed that eight out of ten ambulance trusts in England miss the target for responding to life-threatening calls.

Extra demand is driven by an ageing population and lack of out-of-hours GP care. Ambulance crews also regularly find themselves having to queue outside casualty because staff are too busy to accept them.

One paramedic, based in the North East, said demand had grown by 6 per cent a year over the past decade. He added: ‘It’s awful. I think it’s on the verge of collapse. We’re getting stuck at hospitals and we can’t respond to patients.’

Yesterday an internal investigation by East of England Ambulance Service found that in January and February last year managers agreed to downgrade calls involving terminally ill patients.

Rather than being sent an ambulance within eight minutes, these patients were made to wait between 20 and 50 minutes. And in some cases ambulances crews were not sent at all and relatives were just given advice on the phone.

The guidance had not been approved by the trust’s most senior management and was flagged up by concerned staff. Anthony Marsh, the ambulance service’s chief executive, said he immediately launched an investigation and ordered the reversal of the changes.

A leaked document last month revealed proposals to extend the window for emergency calls deemed slightly less serious from eight minutes to 19 minutes.

The issue was raised in the Commons yesterday by Labour health spokesman Andy Burnham (centre) who blamed ambulance rationing on the growing pressure on accident and emergency wards

The issue was raised in the Commons yesterday by Labour health spokesman Andy Burnham who said: ‘Withholding ambulances from terminally ill people is the most cruel form of rationing imaginable.’

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the number of ambulances dispatched within eight minutes had increased by 22 per cent this year and the service was ‘doing very well under a lot of pressure’.

Last week an unprecedented 13 hospitals declared major incidents because they were unable to cope with the huge volume of patients in casualty. 

Ambulance crews in the north of England have been forced to make 170-mile round trips as 999 provisions reached breaking point.

The North West Ambulance Service deployed two emergency vehicles from Cumbria to Blackpool overnight last Monday.

They were dispatched to help with several life-threatening 999 calls made in the area. 

However, the move stretched other crews serving in South Cumbria, with a smaller pool of ambulances having to cover a greater area as a result.

Mike Oliver, a NWAS paramedic and Unison representative for Cumbria and Lancashire, branded the move 'unacceptable'. 

The North West Ambulance Service deployed two ambulances from Millom and Ulverston to Blackpool to cope with a surge in demand

'Surely there were other crews in Lancashire that would have been able to come from Preston, Leyland or Lancaster,' he said.

'To take two ambulances from South Cumbria to help out in Blackpool just doesn't make sense.

'It's not unusual for crews from South Cumbria to respond to 999 calls in Lancashire. This is usually when they have been called from a hospital after transporting a patient.

'However, when it is 86 miles away we have to ask why weren't other ambulances closer called, especially as South Cumbria is already one of the worst performing areas for response targets.' 

A spokesman for NWAS said the seven other 24/7 crews based further east in South Cumbria could not be sent to Blackpool as they were too busy.

He said: 'Occasionally there is a need to move resources to cope with high demand in a particular area.

'The decision to deploy two vehicles from the Millom and Ulverston areas on the night of January 5 and early hours on January 6 was due to an increase in demand.

'On the night, the vehicles in the Fylde area, dealt with a high number of immediately life-threatening emergency calls.

'Resources are not restricted to areas. We constantly monitor activity against the demand and then decide whether extra resources are required.

'Every patient who needed an ambulance in Cumbria during those hours was responded to.'

NWAS has experienced a huge increase in demand so far this year as A&E departments continue to struggle with high demand.

Between January 1 and 11, NWAS received 12,813 emergency calls in Cumbria and Lancashire - up roughly a quarter compared to the same period last year.
