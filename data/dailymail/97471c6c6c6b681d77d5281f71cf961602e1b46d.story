U.S. airlines have resumed all flights to Mexico City after voluntarily cancelling several dozen because of an eruption from the nearby Popocatepetl volcano, according to an airport official.

Mexico City International Airport information chief Richard Jimenez says United and American Airlines resumed flights Thursday night. On Friday, there were no reports of cancellations by any airline.

At least six U.S. airlines canceled 47 flights into and out of the Mexico City and Toluca airports on Thursday as the volcano spewed a mile-high (1.5 kilometer-high) plume of ash that drifted over large parts of Mexico City, 40 miles (65 kilometers) away.

The volcano also spewed hot a shower of glowing hot rock around its crater.

But by Thursday afternoon no ash had reached the area, about 40 miles (70 kilometers) from the volcano.

Gomez said that among the routes affected by the cancellations were flights to Houston, Dallas, Denver, Phoenix, Chicago and Los Angeles.

At nearby Toluca airport, Spirit Airlines canceled flights from Dallas and Fort Lauderdale, said spokesman Alejandro Munoz.

The airport, about 35 miles (60 kilometers) from Mexico City, also continued to operate normally, Munoz said.

Authorities registered several tremors Thursday at the 17,886-foot (5,450-meter) volcano, which has been spraying a fountain of hot rock and ash for the last 24 hours.

Federal civil protection authorities established a 7-mile (12-kilometer) safety radius around the Popocatepetl, which means no one can enter that area.

They also ensured that no cars passed through the Paseo de Cortes, a mountain pass between the Popocatepetl and Ixtaccihuatl volcanoes.Â
