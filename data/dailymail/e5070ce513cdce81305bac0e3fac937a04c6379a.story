Nemanja Vidic's agent has rubbished reports that the former Manchester United defender is set for a return to Old Trafford.

Vidic joined Inter Milan this summer after agreeing a deal earlier in the year when David Moyes was in charge of the club.

Rumours of a return were fuelled when the Serbian's wife, Ana, and one of their four children watched United's draw with Chelsea in October.

Vidic has struggled to make an impact at the Serie A club since joining in the summer 

But Silvano Martino insists his client will not leave Milan. 

'Not at all, they are all lies,' he told Calciomercato.com.

'Vidic has a three-year deal with Inter and will not leave Milan.

'It's almost useless the nonsense that is spread out and I do not see a reason for him to be linked to other teams.

'There has been little respect towards my client from the press.

'As soon as the Nerazzurri lost a few games, the press did not think twice to attack Vidic and point to him as the sole culprit.

'I repeat: he will not leave Inter.'

Inter have endured a miserable Serie A campaign, languishing in 12th. Roberto Mancini took over from Walter Mazzarri last month.
