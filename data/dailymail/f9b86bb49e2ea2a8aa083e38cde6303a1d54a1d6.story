After more than three decades of bitter controversy, a coroner ruled yesterday that a dingo was responsible for the death of a baby in the Australian Outback.

The decision finally confirmed that a wild desert dog had entered the tent in which Azaria Chamberlain and her  family were staying, near Ayers Rock, and carried her away to her death.

There were emotional scenes yesterday when the verdict was delivered. Azaria’s mother Lindy, now 64, tearfully embraced her former husband Michael and other  family members in the courtroom.

Ruling: Lindy Chamberlain-Creighton was sentenced to life for murdering her baby Azaria 32 years ago. Today a coroner in Australia ruled that the youngster was taken by a dingo

Mrs Chamberlain-Creighton, as she is 
known following her remarriage, served nearly four years of a life 
sentence for murder before being released after new evidence was 
discovered.

In the 32 years since she cried out  
in the night ‘A dingo’s got my baby!’, there have been four inquests and
a government inquiry into nine-week-old Azaria’s death.

But it was the verdict delivered in 
Darwin yesterday that has put the seal on whether or not a dingo was 
responsible.

Elizabeth Morris, the Northern Territory coroner, said she 
was ‘satisfied that the evidence is sufficiently adequate, clear, cogent
and exact and that the evidence excludes all other reasonable 
possibilities’ than that the baby was taken by one or more dingoes.

The case, which divided Australians, 
inspired six books and a 1988 Hollywood movie A Cry in the Dark, 
starring Meryl Streep as Lindy Chamberlain.

Mrs Chamberlain-Creighton 
was jailed in 1982 after being found guilty of slashing her daughter’s 
throat and making it look like a dingo attack.

She was released in 1986 after 
Englishman David Brett fell to his death while climbing Ayers Rock – 
known today by its Aboriginal name of Uluru – and landed beside a 
matinee jacket that was vital to her defence.

Mrs Chamberlain-Creighton 
had told police that no dingo saliva had been found on Azaria’s jumpsuit
because the baby was wearing a matinee jacket over the jumpsuit, but no
jacket was found at the time the child disappeared.

A third inquest in 1995 could not 
determine the cause of death. Mr Chamberlain, who was convicted of being
an accessory after the fact of murder but later exonerated, then fought
a long legal battle for a fourth inquest.

That inquest heard new evidence of dingo attacks, including three fatal attacks on children since the third inquest.

Trial: Lindy and Michael Chamberlain leave a courthouse in Alice 
Springs, Australia in February 1982. Lindy was originally jailed for 
murdering baby Azaria  with Michael given a suspended sentence for 
being an accessory

Ordeal: Mrs Chamberlain-Creighton served six years for her murder before being acquitted in 1988. She had always claimed that a dingo killed their child.

Mrs Chamberlain-Creighton, who has two
sons and a daughter who was born shortly after she started her prison 
term, has been spat at and abused by members of the public over the 
years.

Outside court, she said she was 
‘relieved and delighted to come to the end of this saga’ and that the 
verdict was ‘such a vindication’ for her and her former husband.

She wept when asked what she thought 
her Azaria might be like if she had lived – the day before would have 
been her 32nd birthday.
