Nigel Farage says it is an ‘outrage’ that he is banned from attending today’s Cenotaph ceremony, despite winning most votes in this year’s European elections.

Traditionally, only the representatives of parties with at least six MPs can attend the event. Mr Farage is a Euro MP and although Ukip has one MP – Tory defector Douglas Carswell – that does not entitle Farage to join Cameron, Clegg, Miliband and leaders of a host of minor parties who will lay wreaths at the Cenotaph.

Some have a fraction of the 4.4 million votes won by Ukip in the Euro elections, more than any other party.

Seeing Red: But Nigel Farage, with Spitfire cufflinks, is furious Ukip will not be represented by Cenotaph today

‘It is outrageous that Ukip supporters will not be represented at the Cenotaph,’ Mr Farage told The Mail on Sunday.

He was speaking moments after being photographed close to tears at the Tower of London ceramic poppy field. In an interview during which his mood swung from his trademark bravado and cheek to fury and less-familiar self- doubt, he:

Farage, sporting Spitfire cufflinks, said he was ‘provoked’ into going to the poppy field by The Guardian newspaper which had attacked the ‘toothless and fake’ tribute.

‘They called it a “Ukip-style memorial” and I was so bloody cross, I thought “I’m jolly well going there.” Yes, the crowd did have a Ukip feel – decent, patriotic Brits of every colour and creed.’

Farage’s emotions about the First World War were stirred as a schoolboy when he learned how his grandfather Harry Farage was injured in a Mills bomb (early hand grenade) raid in 1915, with the Victoria Cross going to his grandad’s comrade, James Keyworth.

Most of the 70 soldiers in the raid were killed or injured and Farage researched the heroics of Keyworth, who astonishingly lobbed 150 Mills bombs on his own.

‘They were so heavy they had to be bowled overarm like cricket balls, typically English, but damned dangerous. Keyworth had the VC pinned on him by George V at Buckingham Palace, went back to the trenches and was killed weeks later. Let The Guardian sneer at that.’ 

The Ukip leader, pictured here in Rochester, admits he is 'not steady enough' to be Prime Minister

When Farage learned Keyworth’s ‘dead man’s penny’ (a small memorial plaque issued to the next of kin of all those who died in the First World War) was on sale, he bought it.

I wasn’t certain Farage would turn up. Two days earlier, The Mail on Sunday ran two articles about him guaranteed to ignite his short fuse, one about alleged ex-mistress Annabelle Fuller, another about his seedy political marriage of convenience with a ragbag of Euro racists, neo-Nazis and homophobes to get his hands on Euro grants.

He forces me to put my pencil down to complain about the Fuller story, with dark mutterings of legal issues.

What does he say to those who say Ukip is anti-immigrants and anti-black?

Farage barks: ‘The most anti- black organisation I know is Brussels. They have destroyed the lives of tens of thousands of Africans with protectionist laws that make it impossible for them to sell produce to us.’

And his dodgy deals with racist Poles and Swedish neo- Nazis?

‘Have you made a fuss over the Greens at the European Parliament having people who supported paedophilia, the Conservatives teaming up with a man with a conviction for racism or that Labour is in a group with screaming homophobes from Croatia?’

Little Nigel Napoleon’s eyes nearly pop out with indignation (Farage is said to be descended from French Huguenots).

He says the EU is close to being ‘taken over’ by the Germans but unlike Britain, they can never leave. ‘They have to back the EU because it shows they are decent human beings after their nasty past.’

He expects more Tory MP defectors – and one Labour – but refuses to give names. He doesn’t so much say the word ‘Cameron’ as spit it on the floor.

Mr Farage believes Prince William (right) should be the next King, not 'pro-Green, pro-EU' Prince of Wales

‘He has no chance of winning the Election. He’s beaten himself with windmills, more Europe, Green taxes.’

While he regrets not being at the Cenotaph, it will avoid a public spat with another posh boy he loathes – Prince Charles. Arch global-warming sceptic Farage refused to join a standing ovation when Charles called for action to curb climate change in a speech to the European Parliament.

‘It’s a good job I’m not having a brandy, or I’d tell you what I really think,’ he thunders. ‘He turned up to a foreign institution with far too much power over our country and told them they need more power to combat a problem that might not exist. If Charlie boy had been right, the ice caps would have gone by now.

‘I sat there thinking, “What is he on?” I’m glad I refused to join the ovation.’

Would Charles make a good King?

‘The younger generation are marvellous,’ he says with a wink. Skip Charles and give the crown to William?

‘Judge for yourself.’

He turns it into a joke. ‘These days, Downton Abbey types vote Green while the footmen, butler and kitchen maids vote Ukip. Mind you, the Queen Mother was more Ukip than Ukip!’

Because she liked a drink?

‘Ha!’ How about the Duke of Edinburgh and his ‘slitty eyes Chinese’-type gaffes?

‘Yes, he’d have to tone it down a bit to get in.’

But Jack the Lad Nigel bites his lip when asked about his own mum, Barbara, who posed in the buff for a charity calendar. ‘I was a bit surprised,’ is all he will say.

Perhaps he doesn’t like the competition.

Blokes might like the idea of a beer with him, but his blazered golf club image is a turn-off to women and voters would run a million miles if he got anywhere near No 10. I braced myself for another Mills bomb. Not a bit. He more or less ran up the white flag.

‘Perhaps they think the PM should be a Steady Eddie,’ he reflected. ‘And maybe I’m not a Steady Eddie. I want to change things, but I can’t change who I am.’
