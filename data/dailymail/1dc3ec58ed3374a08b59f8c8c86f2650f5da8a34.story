A rare butterfly has been spotted in Britain for the first time in 60 years, having migrated from Eastern Europe.

The only previous record of a wild Yellow-legged Tortoiseshell in Britain was in 1953, when it was seen just once in Sevenoaks, Kent.

In the past week there have already been four confirmed sightings, along the East coast in Norfolk, Suffolk and Kent, and six further reports of the butterfly in coastal areas stretching as far north as Lincolnshire.

Conservationists are very excited about the sightings, which are as rare an occurrence as anything in the butterfly world.

There have been four confirmed sightings of a Yellow-legged tortoiseshell butterfly on the east coast this week and another six possible sightings as far north as Lincolnshire

Richard Fox, of the Butterfly Conservation charity, said: ‘The Yellow-legged Tortoiseshell usually is seen in Eastern Europe - we have only one recorded sighting in this country before now, and that was in 1953.

‘So to have up to ten sightings in a week is incredibly exciting.’

The butterflies are thought to have flown on easterly winds across Europe in the last few weeks.

Mr Fox said: ‘We were tipped off by colleagues in Netherlands that they had seen about 40 of these butterflies, the first time they had ever been seen in their country before.

‘When they reached the Dutch coast they told us to keep an eye out for them coming over.’

The large and colourful insect has a territory stretching from from Eastern Europe to Japan.

In recent years it has spread into Scandinavia and thrives during warm weather.

Also known as the Scarce Tortoiseshell, it has an orange and blue colour, measuring just over two inches (6cm) from wing-tip to wing-tip, and is about one third bigger than our own Small Tortoiseshell.

Sir David Attenborough, President of the Butterfly Conservation, is this week promoting the Big Butterfly Count

Butterfly Conservation is this weekend launching its annual Big Butterfly Count, a yearly survey of the butterflies across the nation.

It has been a terrific summer for butterflies so far, and the charity is hoping to record sightings of 1 million butterflies in the next three weeks.

Sir David Attenborough, president of the charity, said: ‘The UK is a nation of amateur naturalists and we have a proud tradition of celebrating and studying our wildlife.

‘By taking part in the Big Butterfly Count this summer you can contribute to this heritage and discover the fantastic butterflies and other wildlife that share your garden, parks and countryside.

‘The spectacle of Red Admirals and Small Tortoiseshells flitting around buddleia bushes is one of the classic sights of British summertime.

‘Butterflies fought back last year after a terrible 2012 but despite this, butterfly numbers were still below average.

Three-quarters of the UK’s butterflies are in decline and one-third are in danger of extinction.

‘This is bad news for butterflies and it is bad news for the UK’s birds, bees, bats and other wildlife. This is because butterflies are a key indicator species of the health of our environment – if they are struggling, then many other species are struggling also.’

Taking place in the Butterfly Count is simple - to participate, find a sunny spot and spend 15 minutes counting every butterfly seen. Submit sightings online at www.bigbutterflycount.org.
