Killed: Teenage girl Binno was killed allegedly by her neighbour after he tried to urinate outside her house (stock picture)

A 17-year-old girl has been allegedly shot dead by a man after he tried to urinate outside her house.

The girl’s mother had tried to stop Javed, a former tenant of her family's, as he started urinating outside their front gate when he pulled out a gun and shot them both on Wednesday evening it is alleged.

The teenager, named only as Binno, had been inside the house when her mother Sadmani, 40, had gone out to confront the man.

A commotion ensued and when Binno went out to help her mother, it is alleged that Javed shot her twice in the abdomen and Sadmani once in Hazrat Nizamuddin, south Delhi, India.

A neighbour told The Indian Express: 
‘Binno, fondly known as Gudiya, and her mother Sadmani were preparing 
for dinner and were watching TV when their former tenant Javed, who was 
under the influence of alcohol, came to their house with a friend.

‘Javed stood outside their house and began relieving himself.

‘The mother and daughter came out and asked Javed to refrain from doing so.’

A police officer was quoted in India Today saying: ‘When Sadmani tried to prevent him from the act, the accused allegedly started abusing her.

After Binno's mother tried to stop Javed, he allegedly pulled out a pistol and shot her and Binno in Hazrat Nizamuddin, south Delhi (pictured)

'Hearing the commotion, Binno also came outside the house.’

Javed then allegedly opened fire on the pair before fleeing the scene.

Mother and daughter were taken to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences where Binno was declared dead on arrival.

Sadmani’s condition is critical, it has been reported.

Binno had been in class 11 at a government school in Jangpura.

Additional Commissioner of Police Ajay Chaudhary told IANS: ‘We have registered a case and have launched a hunt for Javed.’
