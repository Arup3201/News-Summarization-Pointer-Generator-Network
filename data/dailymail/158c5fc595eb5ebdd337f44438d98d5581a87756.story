Britain's longest serving dinner lady has no plans to hang up her apron after working at the same school for almost 50 years.

Julie Barrick, 75, has served up 1.6 million lunches to more than 10,000 different pupils since she joined St Luke's Ceva Primary School in Duston, Northampton in 1965.

The great-grandmother has dished out lunch to several generations of the same families over the years - including her two children and two of her five grandchildren.

Her long service beat the previous record holder Sue Dotchin, 66, who spent 44 years in the dinner hall at Benson Primary School near Wallingford, Oxfordshire, until she retired in 2010.

Yet Mrs Barrick, who lives near the school with her husband David, 78, says retirement is a long way off.

She said: 'I've just always liked working here. There is a really nice atmosphere.

'The school has changed a lot since I've been here but children are still the same.

'They maybe come in to school with more confidence as they have usually been to nursery first.

'I've got no plans of retiring at the moment but it depends on my health. I'm quite able to go and do the same work as the other girls do.'

Mrs Barrick was one of two cooks when she first started at the school 48 years ago but now serves up the hot meals that have been provided on-site for the past two years.

The grandmother-of-five said: 'At the start everything we did was done with fresh meat and everything was made from scratch.

'The pies were all made on the premises, we used to make our own bread and chips.

'There was no packets or no frozen vegetables but now the meals are not all done from fresh.

'There's two ladies that work in the kitchen now that do cook but things don't start from scratch.'

Mrs Barrick, who grew up in Martock, Somerset, has seen former school dinner favourites such as steak and kidney pudding replaced with modern offerings such as pizza.

She said: 'I think children ate better back then than they do now. When I started they had to have a cooked dinner and they didn't bring sandwiches.

'They like rubbish food nowadays like the pizzas and nuggets. It used to be all roast dinners and meat pies and they used to love it.

'They used to eat liver and bacon but I bet the kids now wouldn't even look at it.'

Now the mother-of-two, who has been married for 57 years, is serving food to the offspring and grandchildren of pupils from the early days of her career.

'The children come and say you used to give my mum or nan her dinner too. I meet people and they say "are you still at that school?"

Her job also meant she saw her children - Wendy, 56, and David, 53 - during the day as well as at hometime.

'My daughter was already at the school when I got the job and my son went there too. And then his two sons went to the school as well.

'Since I've been at the school I've seen my children's era go through and their children's era go through and now I'm starting to see their children's era.'

The dedicated dinner lady reduced her working hours in 1991 from 9am till 3pm to 11.45am till 1.15pm.

Carol Smith, administrator at St Luke's, which has 350 pupils, said: 'She is a fantastic role model to the children, she helps in the interviewing process of new lunchtime staff and is a stalwart of the community.'
