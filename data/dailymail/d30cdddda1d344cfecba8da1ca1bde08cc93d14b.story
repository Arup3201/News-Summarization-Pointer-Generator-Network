Steve Bruce has paid tribute to goalkeeper Allan McGregor for saving his Hull side from another defeat — but acknowledges the club’s fans are justified in being frustrated.

The point Hull gained from their dire draw with West Brom was insufficient to stop them falling into the relegation zone. 

The ‘highlights’ amounted to McGregor saving a poorly-taken early penalty from Graham Dorrans, and later making a brilliant stop from a Craig Gardner free-kick.

The 32-year-old Scottish goalkeeper was hospitalised with kidney damage in March after a collision at West Ham and has suffered injuries for much of the time since. But he is back as first-choice goalkeeper now.

Hull and West Brom have three wins between them in their last 20 games.

‘He won us a point,’ Bruce said. ‘He got injured badly at West Ham. Perhaps it wasn’t life-threatening but it was one of those awful ones. He could have lost a kidney and it might have ended his career.

‘We had to be patient with him and he’s worked extremely hard. The save from the free-kick was the save of the season as far as I’m concerned.’

The home crowd were restless at yet another display without a win. ‘It’s the first time in my two-and-a-half years that I can detect the crowd are upset at the end,’ Bruce said. 

‘To be fair, I can understand. However, I am sure something will turn for us. 

'We’ve had a really difficult start with injuries and late goals and suspensions but when I look at the squad and what we’ve got, I’m convinced we’ll be OK.'
