Passengers had to be evacuated from an airplane after it caught fire on the tarmac of a Seattle airport on Saturday night.

Terrified travellers were told to evacuate after flames were discovered bursting from the airplane's tail mere minutes before the United Airlines flight was bound to take off for Washington, D.C.

Fortunately, all passengers were safely evacuated from the plane, a Seattle-Tacoma airport spokesman said.

Seattle firefighters responded to a distress call minutes before the flight was bound to take off at 10:30 pm.

They were able to contain the fire and evacuate all passengers before anyone came to harm.

Perry Cooper, spokesman for Sea-Tac airport said a preliminary investigation indicated that the fire might be traceable to residual oil in the auxiliary power unit, which is located in the plane's tail.

The Boeing 757 which had arrived from Chicago earlier that day was towed to cargo services for further investigation.

United Airline's website indicated that the flight's passengers were to be put on another plane a couple of hours later.

Last year, United Airlines reportedly carried more traffic than any other airline in the world, and operated more than two million flights carrying 142 million passengers.
