One Price Is Right contestant clearly got a bit confused about the rules - the main one being guessing the right price.

Footage from Tuesday's episode shows 34-year-old Adam Papendick from California throwing his arms up and cheering in celebration despite valuing a luggage set incorrectly.

The religious studies student then barges past fellow players - including a woman who got the correct answer - and triumphantly making his way to the stage.

However, Papendick's excitement is cut short when the show's host Drew Carey tells him he has nothing to cheer about.

'You're $550, she's $500,' Carey says, trying to usher Papendick back to his seat.

The true victor, Linda Amico, then walks past him clapping her hands to claim her prize.
