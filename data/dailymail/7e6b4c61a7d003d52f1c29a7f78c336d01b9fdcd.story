Returning Essendon coach James Hird sold his Melbourne mansion for about $1.5million more than he purchased the palatial property for three years ago but slightly less than the asking price.

Swinford, the renovated Toorak investment property went under the hammer for $4.2 million late last year.  

It is believed that Hird, who returned to the Essendon football club last August after a 12-month suspension due to a doping scandal within the club, and his wife Tania, hoped to sell the five-bedroom property for $4.75 million plus. 

The couple renovated the home in the affluent suburb of Toorak, south-east from Melbourne, after they bought it for $2.76 million in early 2011.
