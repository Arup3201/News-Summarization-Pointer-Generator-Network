A couple who spent £6,000 rescuing a cat from the Arab Spring uprising in Egypt have been left devastated after he disappeared.

Railton and Dawn Elliott fell in love with the cat, whom they named Omar after the actor Omar Sharif, while on holiday at the Red Sea resort of El Gouna in February last year.

They shelled out a fortune in quarantine and vets’ bills, and the cat settled into his new life in rural Oxfordshire.

But Omar, pictured, vanished two weeks ago – just over a year after leaving quarantine.

The pair, who run confectionery firm Elliotts of Oxford, are now 
offering a £25 reward and a lifetime’s supply of chocolate for his 
return.

Mrs Elliott, who lives in the village of Combe, said: ‘We’re absolutely
heartbroken. We’d give anything to have him back. He’s such a lovely 
and friendly creature.’

Mrs Elliot, 46, revealed that the couple had spent nearly £2,000 on six months’ quarantine, excluding food and vets’ bills.

The remaining money was spent on petrol going to visit the cat, his 
flight back from Egypt, a taxi to Luxor Airport and also Egyptian vet 
bills.

Mr Elliott, 57, said: ‘We were left with no option but to bring Omar 
home with us. Most people come back from holiday with a wooden or china 
animal but we were going to bring a real one back.

‘I left Dawn to sort out the finances –  I didn’t care what it cost, I just wanted him home.

‘Omar has loved his new surroundings, particularly the surrounding fields and woods where he could roam to his heart’s content.

‘I’ve had cats all my life and have never known one to be so gentle, so loving and tender. We are heartbroken.’

Mr Elliot stated that they were almost alone at the resort when they came across the beautiful cat, due to concerns about escalating violence in Egypt, as hundreds of people fled the country.

He added: 'The holiday resort was huge but deserted, so we were upgraded to a villa right on the beach front. The next morning the most beautiful cat appeared.

'He had sought refuge in a bush immediately to the front of our villa and over the next few days we fed him three times a day with food we collected from the hotel buffet, and became great friends with our new chum whom we named Omar in homage to the great actor, Omar Sharif.'

At the end of the holiday, the couple had become so attached to the cat that they couldn't bare to leave it on its own to fend for itself.

They approached the hotel manager and unsuccessfully offered to pay vet bills if the hotel adopted Omar.

Mr Elliott said: 'We were left with no option but to bring him home with us. Most people come back from holiday with a wooden or china animal but we were going to bring a real one back.'

After managing to arrange for someone to care for him temporarily in Egypt, the couple had Omar flown back to the UK where he spent six months in quarantine.

But the couple were distraught when Omar disappeared and have been putting up posters and flyers through neighbours’ letter boxes in a bid to find him.
