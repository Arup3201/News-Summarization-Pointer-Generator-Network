In the late 1930s, the jet engine was confined to a collection of sketches produced by a British engineer.

His initial designs were ignored, but the blueprints would end up revolutionising the planes are powered and, 80 years on, they still influence the way aircraft is put together.

Now the paperwork which documented the development of the turbojet engine is being sold at auction, and is expected to fetch at least £30,000.

Concept: A 1941 drawing of the first prototype jet engine, using the ideas of inventor Frank Whittle. It is part of a collection of paperwork which documents the development of the first turbine-powered engine

Secret sketch: The jet expansion chamber designed by one of Sporborg's engineers. The collection of sketches and letters are expected to fetch at least £30,000 at auction

The paperwork collection of memos and 
letters were kept by Henry Storborg, whose engineeering company produced
 prototypes for inventor Frank Whittle.

The
 documents, which were marked as 'secret', include specification and 
memos which led to the completion of the first turbine-powered engine in
 1937.

Sporborg was the senior director and chief engineer of Thomson-Houston BT-H. He kept the material knowing it was of great scientific and historic importance.

The material is now being sold by auctioneers Bonhams, and is expected to be sold for at least £30,000.

Among the documents is the original 1938 contract between the Air Ministry, Whittle's firm Power Jets Ltd and BT-H.

There are also technical pencil drawings showing the engine as it was developing.

What resulted from these first engines was the 'jet age' that would go on to transform air travel.

First design: The Gloster Meteor was Britain's first operational jet, and was used by the Allies during WWII

Turbojet: The designs kept by Sporborg led to the production of the first turbine engine, the W2BWelland, which powered the first jet planes

Though Whittle had submitted his first
 patent for the jet engine in 1930 it was only eight years later that 
the Air Ministry took an interest following the creation of a prototype.

In
 1939, the ministry's director of scientific research, David Pye, was 
shown a demonstration of the prototype and was totally convinced of its 
importance.

The ministry 
then placed an order for a flyable version and Whittle began work on the
 Type W1.The following January the ministry placed an order for a larger
 more advanced engine, the W2.

Linked: The expansion chamber would be connected to the main jet engine's turbine design

Top secret: Minutes from the meeting where the upgrade from the W2 engine, the first turbine-propelled design, to the more advanced Mark II was discussed

With the Germans developing their own engine, the race was on, and this archive logs the important stages of the development through the early years of World War Two.

One letter from David Pye, the air minister, in January 1940, records the moment that the ministry decided the project was valuable.

It was written to Sporborg and states:
 'I hope that if you are fully aware of the great importance that the 
Air Ministry attach to the development of this Whittle engine you will 
take all steps in your power to ensure that no unnecessary delay occurs 
in the completion of these engines and that you will do all you can to 
assist Power Jets Limited in their work.'

Looking to the future: A letter from the Air Ministry urging Sporborg to continue the jet-building programme, which was advancing military aircraft at the time

The
 documents also highlight the strain and stresses between the various 
parties as they tried to complete the project in time to influence the 
war.

The jet-powered Gloster Meteor finally entered service with the RAF in July 1944.

Matthew
 Haley, head of the books and manuscripts department at Bonhams, said: 
'Whittle had offered his idea to the Air Ministry in 1930, but it wasn't
 until much later that they become interested, after he had joined with 
Sporborg's company to make them.

Official g-ahead: A telegram from Air Vice Marshall Tedder belatedly giving permission for Sporborg's engineers to build the prototype jet engines

'These documents were commercially sensitive and because it happened during the war there was an added level of classification.

'Sporborg saved the documents he deemed important; the cream of the crop.

'When we think of aeroplanes in World War Two we probably think of Spitfires, but not long after the war we entered the jet age because of Whittle's work. The archive will have wide appeal.'

While Whittle and BT-H were developing their jet engine, the Germans were also working on their own.

Hans von Ohain had started work on a prototype in 1935, and after the war told Whittle: 'If you had been given the money you would have been six years ahead of us.

'If Hitler or Goering had heard that there is a man in England who flies 500mph in a small experimental plane and that it is coming into development, it is likely that World War II would not have come into being.'

Innovative: Frank Whittle applied for the first jet engine patent in 1930. He had completed the first prototype by 1937

The 'Jet Age' saw the development of aircrafts powered by turbine engines, rather than propeller blades or pistons.

The term was coined in the 1940s, but most of the early jet planes were military designs rather than commercial.

Frank Whittle would lead Britain into Jet Age, producing the first engine in 1937, but he was nearly beaten by a German, who completed his design just five months later.

Whittle applied for a patent of his design in 1930, after rising through the RAF ranks from an apprentice mechanic to reporting to the man in charge of the research.

His ideas were initially shot down, and his patent ran out in 1935, but some of his colleagues invested in his future ventures.

Competition: Whittle was up against German physicist Hans von Ohain in the race to complete the first design

Whittle set up a small company called Power Jets in 1936, which began work on a prototype engine.

The same year Hans von Ohain, a young physics and aerodynamics student at

Germany's 
University of Göttingen, applied for a patent for a 'Process and 
Apparatus for Producing airstreams for Propelling Airplanes.'

The race to design the first turbojet engine was on. Whittle was on a shoestring budget while von Ohain, whose family were from the Prussian aristocracy, had a virtually unlimited amount of money.

But Whittle made the breakthrough on April 2, 1937, after fitting a simple drainage system to his design to stop fuel from pooling in the combustion chamber.

Fighter plane: The Me 262 had a similar design to the Gloster Meteor, but became operational first when it was drafted into the Luftwaffe in 1944

Two years later, despite ignoring his ideas for years, the Air Ministry tested his prototype and decided they would use it in military aircraft. Many would be used during the Second World War and Whittle was able to pilot his first jet-propelled plane in 1945, reaching 606mph.

Hans von Ohain had started work on a 
prototype in 1935, and after the war told Whittle: 'If you had been 
given the money you would have been six years ahead of us.

'If
 Hitler or Goering had heard that there is a man in England who flies 
500mph in a small experimental plane and that it is coming into 
development, it is likely that World War II would not have come into 
being.'

Despite creating the first engine, the Germans produced the first operational jet-powered fighter plane, the Me 262 Schwalbe.

Initially it was beset by engine problems, but it became a part of the Luftwaffe in 1944.

Whittle's 1928 thesis and 1930 patent had led to a true revolution in 
military and civilian air travel.

Thirty years after fighters and 
bombers had been hard-pressed to exceed 200 mph, their successors were 
traveling at 10 times that speed, and long-distance travel times were 
halved.
