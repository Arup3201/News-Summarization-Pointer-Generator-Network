A Michigan man is dead after crashing his car into an abandoned house swarming with bees thatÂ  hindered rescuers from approaching the victim and saving the man's life.

The 54-year-old man was driving through the village of St. Charles when he lost control of his Hyundai and crashed into an abandoned corner house, local authorities said.

Neighbors who heard the crash rushed in to help the man, but they halted when they saw a swarm of angry bees had taken over the inside of the home.

'The house, we're being told, has not been occupied for many years,' Sheriff Lt. Randy Pfau, of Saginaw County, told The Saginaw News.

The rescue crew, which included a beekeeper, covered this abandoned house in St. Charles, Michigan, with foam to keep the angry little insects from spreading throughout the neighborhood

Preliminary reports indicate that the victim, a 54-year-old local man, lost control of his car because of a medical emergency

'There were just large swarms of bees within the home,' Pfau added. 'It was so infested, they couldn't get to him.'

Together, neighbors and first responders attached a tow strap to the back of the car to pull out the victim, whose name has not been released.

Firefighters were eventually able to pull him out, but it was too late.

'They tried to render aid,' Pfau told the Saginaw News. 'It was later determined he was deceased at the scene.'

Preliminary reports say the victim lost control of the vehicle due to a medical emergency.

Investigators are still awaiting the results of an autopsy to determine the nature of the emergency and what eventually killed the man.
