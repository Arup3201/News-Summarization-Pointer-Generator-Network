The Jubilee weekend may be over, but the Queen showed no signs of slowing down as she attended a lunch with Commonwealth heads of state this afternoon.

Looking impossibly fresh faced and elegant in purple jacket and floral dress by Stuart Parvin, the monarch displayed yet again the strength, stoicism and enduring energy that has won back the nation's affection over the past year.

The Queen, whose car passed human rights protesters on her way to the lunch, attended the event alone, as the Duke of Edinburgh remained in hospital with a bladder infection.

Boundless energy: On the fifth day of Jubilee celebrations our heroic 
Queen is greeted by the Commonwealth Secretary-General, 
Kamalesh Sharma as she arrives for a Commonwealth Heads reception and 
lunch

Beaming:
The Queen, who admitted in a public address made on Monday evening that she was 'humbled' by the enthusiasm with which 
the nation marked her Jubilee, looked delighted to be continuing the 
celebrations

Immaculate: As ever, the Queen looked perfectly turned out in her floral Stuart Parvin dress and purple jacket

She was joined by more than 70 
guests and leaders from across the association of nations, including Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife Samantha.

Yesterday the Prime Minister hailed the Queen 'a real inspiration', saying she had 'great resilience'.

He said the Jubilee weekend celebrations had revealed 'the best of Britain'.

'We’ve seen people coming together in
tremendous unity and spirit to celebrate the Queen’s Jubilee, but we’ve
also seen a great resilience; people wanting to celebrate, even though 
the weather’s been pretty bad, and an extraordinary resilience on behalf
of her Majesty, who in spite of all the problems and difficulties has 
kept going, and with such incredible spirit. She’s a real inspiration.'

Joie de vivre: The Queen has seemed to thoroughly enjoy the Jubilee celebrations from start to finish

The monarch and her luncheon guests arrived to angry scenes as hundreds of Tamil and human rights 
campaigners gathered outside Marlborough House in central London in 
opposition to Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse’s presence at the 
meal.

Their chants echoed around the forecourt as guests arrived.

Mr Rajapakse was jeered as he swept 
through the main gate in a Range Rover. His car did not carry a flag 
because of security concerns.

The Queen seemed relaxed as she was 
handed a bouquet by nine-year-old Aduke Badale, the daughter 
of a member of the Commonwealth Secretariat staff.

The Queen spent a brief moment with 
Mr Rajapakse and appeared to fleetingly shake hands with him as she met 
guests at a reception in the Blenheim Saloon inside Marlborough House.

Heads of state and representatives 
from Australia, Canada and the African nations were welcomed by 
Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma.

As his mother hosted a lunch for 70 at Marlborough House in central London today, Prince Charles attended his own engagement - but his was a touch less formal.

Prince Charles left London early this morning to make a trip to the Ayrshire where he paid a visit to Scotsheep 2012, an agricultural show held at Dumfries House.

Wearing a cream jacket - a departure from the green Barbour jacket he usually favours - he moved between the stands, chatting to local farmers and posing for photographs.

The prince is a patron of Campaign For Wool, an organisation set up in support of the wool trade, which was exhibition at the event.

Country gent: Prince Charles swapped his formal attire for a natty cream jacket - a departure from his usual green Barbour jackets - as he attended Scotsheep 2012, an event for Scottish farmers held at Dumfries House

Worthy cause: Charles is a patron for the Campaign For Wool, an 
organisation initiated by the Prince of Wales in 2008 to lend support to
the wool industry
