A Tory councillor formerly known as ‘Big Dave’ has announced he is undergoing a sex change.

David Chaplin returned to work following the death of his wife wearing a blonde wig and a dress.

The 65-year-old said he was now called Jane and was undergoing hormone replacement therapy.Miss Chaplin, as she is now known, has asked staff and colleagues at Wellington town council in Shropshire to refer to her as a woman.

She revealed that she was having a sex change because she had felt trapped in the wrong body for almost 50 years but had told no one for fear of how they would react.

Miss Chaplin, who was married for 37 years and fathered two children, said: ‘I’ve known more or less my whole life what my true gender is, but when I was growing up people weren’t as understanding about it as they are now.

‘I was petrified of telling people, because I knew in those days I would have been marginalised and ridiculed. It was an awful burden to carry all those years.’

Elected as David Chaplin three years ago, the burly town councillor took leave of absence following the death of wife Rosemary, 65, in May last year.

Part of the reason for the long wait to change sex was out of respect for her. ‘I cared a great deal for my wife, and didn’t want to dump that kind of news on her,’ said Miss  Chaplin, from Telford, Shropshire, who works as private sector housing manager for Cannock Chase Council.

‘I was obviously racked with nerves when I had to tell my family and friends, but I was shocked to learn a lot of them kind of already knew.

‘They had no idea I was a woman deep down inside, but most of them sensed there was something different about me.

‘But I have known for many years that I have wanted to go in this direction and transition, which means you follow the process that takes you from one gender to another. But life gets in the way.

‘My fellow councillors have been wonderful, and it hasn’t affected my career in any way.

‘It is a great relief to be able to be who I am, and who I have always regarded myself to be. I am very happy in my life now.’

Residents in Wellington said most people in the area had been very supportive.

Paul Carpenter, 42, said: ‘It doesn’t change what her policies are or how good she is at her job as a councillor.

‘It is her choice – although I suspect her more liberal colleagues might have warmed to the idea a bit more so than her Tory friends.’

However, student Tom Walker, 19, said: It’s just going to confuse people.

‘We always referred to Jane as Big Dave, but we can’t really do that now.’
