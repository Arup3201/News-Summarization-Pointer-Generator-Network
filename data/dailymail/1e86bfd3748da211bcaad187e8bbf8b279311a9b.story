An empty fridge is the worst thing to come home to after a relaxing holiday or a flight across several time zones.

But for those who don't have the energy or time to stop by a supermarket with luggage in tow, a new service is popping up at airports.

With an eye on a small but emerging market, retailers are taking advantage of weary travellers’ hectic schedules by launching click-and-collect services that allow holidaymakers to order groceries from abroad and pick them up when they land at the airport.

Special delivery: Finnish grocery chain HOK-Elanto has set up click-and-collect lockers at Helsinki Airport

Airport grocery collection points are a growing trend in Europe and  Waitrose has announced plans to set up its own refrigerated lockers at long-stay car parks at London Gatwick Airport.

The convenient system is incredibly simple to use – holidaymakers place an order on their smartphone or another device before flying home and, using a code sent to their mobile after paying, retrieve the delivered items without having to divert to a store.

London Underground and Network Rail have both announced plans to turn their stations into pickup points for a host of different retailers, from Sainsbury’s to New Look.

Last week, Finnish grocery store chain HOK-Elanto and e-commerce firm Digital Foodie launched the helpful service for travellers or employees at Helsinki Airport.

HOK-Elanto’s pickup point is located in the arrivals hall and it operates almost around the clock six days a week, although it is located next to a store that sells fruit and vegetables and other items.

Customers are charged a pickup fee of €5 (£3.90) and must give at least three hours’ notice when submitting an order.

Each compartment has its own refrigerator or freezer and is opened with a code sent via text message.

Jukka Ranua, e-commerce manager of HOK-Elanto, said in a statement: ‘With approximately 42,000 passengers arriving daily to Helsinki Airport we know the new pickup service will appeal to many busy travellers.’

Digital Foodie chief executive Kalle Koutajoki added: ‘Our goal is to ease consumers’ chores by offering a tool for more convenient shopping. Coming home from a holiday or work trip is essentially easier without the added hassle of returning to an empty fridge.’

Dutch grocery store chain Albert Heijn became a European pioneer of the service when it set up lockers at Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport last year.
