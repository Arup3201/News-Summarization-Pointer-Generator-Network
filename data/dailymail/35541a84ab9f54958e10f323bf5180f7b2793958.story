Tony Blair was told he was a ‘fool’ to convert to Catholicism by protestant leader Ian Paisley.

The founder of the Free Presbyterian Church and long-time critic of the papacy in Rome made clear his unhappiness with the former Prime Minister’s decision to join the Catholic church.

Mr Blair has said his decision was fuelled by his wife Cherie winning the battle over where the couple should go to Mass.

Tension: Protestant leader Rev Ian Paisley called Tony Blair a 'fool' for converting to Catholicism

Mr Blair has suggested that switching to Catholicism in 2007 was like 'coming home' and is 'where my heart is.'

But he received a frosty reception from Rev Paisley, the former leader of the Democratic Unionist Party,  with whom he often discussed religion.

Mr Blair said he wanted to tell the former Northern Ireland First Minister in person about his decision, even though he knew he would be unhappy about it.

But Rev Paisley dismissed him with a four-word response and walked off.

The encounter on the day Mr Blair formally joined the Catholic church emerged in a new BBC documentary about Rev Paisley’s career in politics.

The pair were leaving a private meeting in 2007 when Mr Blair revealed his plans.

Rev Paisley said: ‘As we were walking down the stairs he stopped, he looked back at me and he said “Ian there is something I need to tell you”.

As Norther Ireland's First Minister and Britain's Prime Minister, the two men often discussed religion

‘”When the hands of that clock”, and he pointed to a big clock that was on the wall, “When the hands of that clock, when they come to eight o'clock I will be a Roman Catholic”.

‘And he said “I didn't want you to leave without telling you, I'd rather tell you myself”.

‘And I said “You are a fool” and I walked on.’

Dr Paisley claimed Mr Blair's grandmother had urged him against ever marrying someone from the Roman Catholic faith or converting himself.

Mr Blair married Catholic lawyer Cherie Booth in 1980 and converted to Catholicism in 2007.

Religious division between Catholic and Protestant communities fuelled much of the unrest and tensions of the Troubles in Northern Ireland.

The issue of Mr Blair’s religion became so sensitive that his spin doctor Alastair Campbell once declared: ‘We don’t do God.’

But after leaving office in June 2007, he began his preparations to become Catholic.

In 2009 Mr Blair told a religious conference in Italy: 'Frankly this all began with my wife.

'I began to go to Mass and we went together. We could have gone to the Anglican or Catholic church - guess who won?

'As time went on, I had been going to Mass for a long time... it's difficult to find the right words. I felt this was right for me. There was something, not just about the doctrine of the Church, but of the universal nature of the Catholic Church.

'Ever since I began preparations to become a Catholic I felt I was coming home and this is now where my heart is, where I know I belong.'

In the BBC documentary, Dr Paisley was asked what his reaction would be if one of his own family came home with a Catholic.

‘I would have bought a long cane and have given him a few strokes with it,’ he joked.

But he then added: ‘I would have said “Let us sit down and ask God his opinion on this” and I would have said “Although you hurt me doing what you are doing, you are my child and my love is greater than my hurt”.

‘And they could come in and out of this house as they would, they would not have been put out by me or my wife either. We wouldn't have liked it but we would lump it.’
