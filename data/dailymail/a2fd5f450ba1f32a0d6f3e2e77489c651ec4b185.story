First it was poor people who don't drive cars, now it seems Joe Hockey has been unwittingly dragged into a controversy over whether his driver stopped in a disabled parking zone when he picked the Treasurer up from Sydney Airport.

But the images don't lie and despite Sydney Airport suggesting there 'was nothing wrong' with the driver's actions, the Treasurer's office did not shirk the matter with its prompt response to questions on the matter today.

'The treasurer was unaware of where the private contractor had parked and had no control over that as he was walking out of the airport terminal,' a spokesman said.

It's unlikely the contractor will make the same mistake again, however, Mr Hockey's office going on toÂ  add that 'the driver has been counselled'.

You decide. Is the Treasurer's chauffeur-driven car stopping in a disabled parking zone at Sydney Airport?

Despite what looks like a clear mistake, Sydney Airport security was contacted and did suggest the driver had not done anything wrong, having stopped in a limousine only area.

That area is accessible only by a swipe card through a boom-gate.

Under NSW Roads and Maritime Services 
parking offences Rule 168-1 (1) Stop/park in a restricted parking area, 
the fine for this infringement would be $104 and 2 demerit points.

Earlier a spokeswoman for Mr Hockey had reportedly told ninemsn that the driver was not fined or even spoken to for stopping where he did, and that there were at least 10 other disabled spots still vacant at the time.

Red marks the spot. It would appear hard for anyone to argue that this chauffeured car is not stopped in a disabled parking bay

Almost 3 and a half million Australians have a disability and Grace Fava from the Autism Advisory and Support Service says this is the sort of situation that she hears about far too often.

'It's not just those with physical disabilities, we also see it happening to parents with children with disabilities, it can make it very hard for them too,' she said.

'Aussies are usually very giving and considerate but this is wrong and I don't care how busy someone is, there is no excuse.

'His driver should know better and he should also know that Joe should not be treated any differently to any of us, I know he is a charitable man but this is not on.'

Ms Fava called on the Treasurer to make a charitable donation to match what would have been the fine ($104).

'It's the honourable thing to do,' she said.

This incident is just the latest in what is fast becoming a cavalcade of car-related gaffes for the embattled Treasurer.

Last week he was forced to apologise after making comments that rich people spend more on fuel than poor households because poor people don't have cars or don't drive far.

For that he was labelled a 'cigar-chomping Foghorn Leghorn' who is out of touch with Australians.

Since then his own personal wealth has come under scrutiny, and more recently the hundreds of thousands of dollars that go towards his own forms of road transport has been revealed.

Mr Hockey's expenditure and entitlements report showed that the treasurer has spent more than $200,000 of taxpayer's money over the past four years on cars and cabs.
