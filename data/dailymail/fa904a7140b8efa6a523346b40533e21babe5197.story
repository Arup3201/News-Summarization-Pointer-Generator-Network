The Duchess of Cambridge sported not one but two outfits for Christmas Day as she swapped her cream overcoat and scarf for a stylish Alexander McQueen tartan coat dress to attend the Royal Family's annual church service at Sandringham.

New mother Kate held hands with her husband Prince William as the couple made their way to St Mary Magdalene Church with their fellow royals.

The Duchess paired her green and navy tartan frock with a green Gina Foster hat topped with a bow, and sported a pair of black gloves to keep out the Christmas chill, as well as her trusty black suede knee-high boots.

Earlier in the day she was seen wearing a thick cream coat, which she had paired with a red tartan scarf, before she shed her snug overgarments for the designer outfit.

All change: Kate removed her overcoat to show off a tartan Alexander McQueen coat dress for this morning's church service

Royal greeting: Kate wore a cream overcoat and a red scarf as she greeted the Queen

All smiles: Kate grins as she makes her way to the morning service on the Sandringham estate

Family ties: Kate and William were joined by other members of the Royal Family for the traditional service

In style: The duchess wore an Alexander McQueen tartan coat dress with a matching green Gina Foster hat topped with a bow

Couple: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge looked relaxed as they made the journey to St Mary Magdalene Church on foot, but there was no sign of Prince George as temperatures stayed just above freezing

It was a repeat appearance for the McQueen coat, which the Duchess wore last November for a trip to her old primary school, St Andrew's in Pangbourne, Berkshire, when she was photographed playing hockey with pupils - who were unaware she was in the early days of her pregnancy.

Just days after Kate enjoyed her sporting visit to St Andrew's, she was rushed to hospital with acute morning sickness.

She and Prince William had hoped to keep the fact that they were having a baby a secret until Christmas Day last year, but were forced to rush into making an announcement when Kate became ill.

Early appearance: Kate was wearing the same pair of black boots as she walked through the Sandringham estate with Princess Anne

Poised: Kate tucked her long dark hair behind her ear as she chatted with the Queen and Princess Anne

Together: Kate was arm in arm with William as they strolled behind Princess Beatrice, Prince Harry and Princess Eugenie

She was barely eight weeks pregnant when she was driven to the King Edward VII hospital in London by her husband in early December last year.

She gave birth to the couple's first child, Prince George, at the same hospital in July.

Today the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge looked relaxed as they made the 
journey to St Mary Magdalene Church on foot holding hands. But there was
 no sign of Prince George as temperatures stayed just above freezing.

Kate smiled and waved to the crowds, and was seen curtseying to the Queen, who was wearing an orange coat, as 
the family attended a private service earlier in the morning.

First appearance: The Duchess first wore the Alexander McQueen coat dress for a visit to her old school, St Andrew's in Pangbourne, Berkshire last year
