Consumers have caused a food wastage crisis for picking visually more attractive produce over imperfectly shaped fruits and vegetables.

Harris Farm Markets have introduced The Imperfect Picks range which offers up to 50 per cent off produce with minor visual imperfections.

Their campaign, an Australia first initiative, revealed thousands of kilos of deformed produce is thrown out every day.

Co-CEO of Harris Farm Markets, Angus Harris, says its time that Australians become mindful of their choice of purchase.

Brother and co-CEO Tristan Harris added the wastage is taking a toll on local farmers as well as increasing the cost of living.

'We want Australians families and the big supermarkets to rethink how they are buying fruit and vegetables in this country,' he said.

'Our commitment to freshness and taste won't ever change, however we've come to realise that when it comes to fresh produce, we shouldn't always judge a product by how it looks.

'So every time you shop the range, you're helping Aussie farmers, the environment and your hip pocket.

'We also know Australian families are concerned about their cost of living, with a recent Choice survey finding 77 per cent are worried about the cost of groceries. With Imperfect Picks being offered at up to half the price of already value for money products, Harris Farm Markets is doing our bit to ease this pressure.'

Australian chef and restaurateur Neil Perry, of Rockpool Group, says there is a food wastage crisis not just in Australia but world wide.

'I think we've got a massive food wastage crisis going on in Australia and the world,' he said.

'There's so much fantastic product that's been wasted for no reason.'

Citrus farmer John Sergi says there's nothing wrong with disfigured produce.

'Imperfect fruit does not mean it tastes bad,' he said. 'The taste is just as good, if not better.'

Harris Farm Markets, an Australian grocery chain, will partner with food waste charity Foodbank as part of its campaign.

The family business, established in 1971, stocks which stocks fruit, vegetables and delicatessen.
