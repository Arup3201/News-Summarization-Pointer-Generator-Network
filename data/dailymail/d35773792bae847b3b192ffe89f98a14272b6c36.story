A case review for 47-year-old Molly Shattuck, of Maryland, had been scheduled for Wednesday, but there were no issues to bring before the judge. The final case review was scheduled for March 18.

Final: Molly Shattuck, 47, former Baltimore Ravens cheerleader faces a final case review in March on charges that she raped a teenage boy and provided other minors with alcohol

Instagram: Shattuck's alleged inappropriate relationship with a 15-year-old boy began on Instagram with Shattuck reportedly sending the teen provocative messages

A lawyer for the mother-of-three, who is free on $84,000 bail, discussed the woman's case with prosecutors but said Shattuck does not plan on altering her not-guilty plea, the Detroit Free Press reports. 

Shattuck's alleged inappropriate relationship with a 15-year-old boy began on Instagram with Shattuck reportedly sending the teen provocative messages, the Baltimore Sun reports.

The teen reportedly sent Shattuck pictures of himself via text message and police say she picked the teen up from summer school during lunch breaks several times. 

Police say the two would 'talk and eat and then get in the back of the car and kiss or make out.' 

The Free Press reports that Shattuck and the boy reportedly met for romantic encounters in the back seat of her car.

Labor Day: The inappropriate relationship with the teen culminated when she allegedly performed oral sex twice on the boy at a rented beach house over Labor Day weekend. 

During Labor Day weekend, the Sun reports that Shattuck rented a beach house for her teenage son and his friends -- the victim included. 

It was then that Shattuck allegedly purchased beer for the boys and later performed oral sex on the 15-year-old at least twice.

She offered to have sex with the teen, but he declined, police say.

The next day, the boy's parents picked him up from the beach house and his family reported Shattuck to the police on Sept. 26. 

Divorced: Nearly one month before her indictment, Shattuck's now ex-husband, Mayo Shattuck, a prominent Maryland energy executive, divorced Shattuck after rumors of the scandal spread throughout the small community of Owings Mills, MD

Cheerleader: In 2005, Shattuck became the oldest NFL cheerleader in history up to that time when the Ravens selected her for the squad. The Baltimore native is also a fitness consultant and advocate as well as an author

Nearly one month before her indictment, Shattuck's now ex-husband, Mayo Shattuck, a prominent Maryland energy executive, divorced Shattuck after rumors of the scandal spread throughout the small community of Owings Mills, MD.

It is unknown whether Shattuck was offered a plea deal, however a plea deal could sentence Shattuck to a lesser penalty than if she were found guilty at trial.

The Sun reports that the terms of a  plea deal could likely require Shattuck to register as a sex offender.

The label could bar Shattuck from attending events at her children's schools.

In 2005, Shattuck became the oldest NFL cheerleader in history up to that time when the Ravens selected her for the squad. 

The Baltimore native is also a fitness consultant and advocate as well as an author.
