Former England manager Sven Goran Eriksson has become the new boss of Chinese Super League side Shanghai East Asia on a two-year deal.

The 66-year-old was unveiled as the club's new coach on Tuesday after signing a contract worth a reported £4million a year.

'I am very happy and very proud that it is finally official that we are here and I am going to be the head coach of this club,' he said after being appointed.

Eriksson's new salary is expected to be double the amount he earned while at fellow Chinese Super League outfit Guangzhou R&F.

Eriksson ended his 15-month spell in charge of Guangzhou R&F by mutual agreement last week, after guiding the team to third last season.

The Swede's task will be to replicate his efforts with Shanghai East Asia, who finished fifth in the CSL last season - nine points adrift of Guangzhou R&F.

The CSL is the top division in China and is currently the highest attended football league in Asia.
