A woman’s teenage lover murdered her severely disabled toddler while she was on the school run.

She then desperately tried to cover up their affair with the boy, ten years his senior.

Cameron Rose, 18, is alleged to have swung epileptic three-year-old Rhys Lawrie by his right leg into a hard object, causing massive head injuries, jurors at Old Bailey heard.

Tragic: Three-year-old Rhys Lawrie, who was killed at his home in Eltham, south east London

The court heard how Rose had allegedly attacked the boy two times before the fatal attack while Sadie Henry, Rhys’ mother lied repeatedly to paramedics and police to try to cover up the relationship because she realised it was ‘ill-advised and inappropriate’.

Rose of Eltham, southeast London claimed the injuries were caused by accidental falls and Rhys knocked himself during epileptic seizures the court heard. Rose is accused of beating Rhys four days before he died, and on another occasion in December 2010.

Miss Henry was 26-years-old when she began her relationship with Rose, when he was just 16-years-old.

Sally Howes QC, prosecuting, said: ‘While it is not illegal for a woman to have a sexual relationship with a 16-year old it may be considered by many to be a the very least ill-advised and inappropriate.

‘The apparent need to conceal the truth of the relationship between Sadie Henry and Cameron Rose forms the backdrop of the police investigation into the death of Rhys Lawrie.

‘Sadie Henry lied repeatedly to paramedics, hospital staff and unfortunately to the police in an effort to hide the true events and circumstances surrounding the death of Rhys and two earlier episodes of assault.’

A post-mortem examination found Rhys had suffered serious head injuries three to five days before death, and on the day he died.

He also had extensive, fingertip-sized bruising to his face, ears, body and both legs and his right leg was fractured.

Forensic expert Doctor Nathaniel Cary found that the injuries were ‘atypical for accidental origin’ and were ‘indicative of multiple blunt force impacts and or gripping to the facial area’.

It is alleged that the tibia fracture was caused by Rhys being swung by his ankle.

Sally Howes, prosecuting said that Dr Cary suggested that ‘the fatal head injury arose from Rhys Lawrie being forcibly swung from the right leg causing an impact to his head or face’.

Rhys suffered from a severe epileptic condition and had to go a special school because he was barely able to walk. 

Miss Henry, a former army medic, met Rose in 2010 at a bonfire party and the pair kept their sexual relationship secret from his mother, who thought he was staying with his brother when he was at Miss Henry’s flat.

Rose would stay with her from Thursday to Monday over most weekends and had only been left alone with Rhys for long periods three times.

Sadie Henry desperately administered CPR and called the emergency services but nothing could be done to save Rhys

Miss Howes told the jury: ‘This is a man who, on the three occasions when he was alone with this child, this child ended up with injuries, and on the last occasion fatal injuries.’

On the first occasion Rhys was injured, nursery staff noticed that he had severe bruising on his face and was ‘wobbly’ in his chair in December 2010.

When the nursery contacted Miss Henry about the bruises, Miss Howes said: ‘She gave the explanation that Rhys had been falling down quite a lot at that stage.'

The mother later told police that Rose told her he had been playing a game with Rhys and he had fallen off the table.

She did not suspect him because Rose had been so ‘calm and collected’ when he gave the explanation.

On the second occasion, Rose claimed he had accidentally elbowed Rhys in the face while in bed.

The toddler then fell off a kitchen counter as Rose bent down to the freezer to get something cold to hold against his face, he said.

Miss Howes told the jury: ‘When she (Miss Henry) returned Cameron Rose met her in the corridor of the flat saying she was stupid to leave Rhys in bed with him as he had elbowed Rhys quite hard in his sleep.’

The boy’s face was so badly swollen that Miss Henry called an ambulance and said her son had suffered two fits because she knew he would have to be taken to hospital.

Rhys was likely to have suffered brain damage in this incident and the injury could have caused ‘confusion and even unconsciousness’ but he was sent home after treatment.

Four days later, Miss Henry left Rhys alone with Rose again. When she returned, Miss Henry asked Rose about Rhys’ whereabouts.

Miss Howes said: ‘Cameron Rose responded that Rhys was in bed as he had a seizure.

‘He said he had choked and he had to bang him on the back quite hard.‘Cameron Rose added Rhys’ eyes were rolling and he had foamed at the mouth.

‘Sadie Henry went to the bedroom. Rhys was under the bedclothes. He looked blue in colour. She was later to tell police: “I knew Rhys was dead when I saw him”.’

The mother desperately administered CPR and called the emergency services but nothing could be done to save Rhys.

After Rhys died, Rose told police he did not get on with Miss Henry’s older child, identified only as B, because he had hit him in the face once and he held ‘grudges’ but he claimed he got on well with Rhys.

Rose denies murder and causing Rhys actual bodily harm.

Miss Henry met the toddler’s father, Chris Lawrie, who was also in the Armed Forces, in 2003. Miss Henry left the forces shortly after she had Rhys and after her relationship with Mr Lawrie failed, she moved into a flat in Erith, south east London.

The trial was adjourned until next Tuesday.
