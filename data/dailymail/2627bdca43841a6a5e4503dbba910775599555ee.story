People off sick for more than four weeks could face a fitness-to-work test under a new crackdown on the ‘sick-note culture’.

Family doctors would no longer authorise long absences from work, under new government plans reported in The Times.

Instead they would pass their patients on for assessment by a private occupational health firm, it is understood.

But asking GPs to refer the long-term sick for fitness-to work tests will reduce them to an 'arm of the benefits system', doctors have warned.

More than one million people take sick leave for more than one month each year - costing the economy more than £9billion.

The programme of fit-to-work tests has been piloted in 20 GP surgeries since last month, through the company Health Management and is set to be rolled out nationwide in the coming months.

Patients must agree to be referred to the company and would face an in-depth assessment of their physical and mental abilities.

Those deemed fit for work would be given access to a range of treatment such as physiotherapy, counselling or help to manage debt and workplace bullying while they try to get back into a job.

While the plans were welcomed by businesses who lose out from long-term sick leave, doctors have indicated they will strongly oppose them if they are compulsory.

Lord Freud, the welfare minister told the newspaper that the scheme would help to cut the cost of sick pay and benefits. He said: ‘The introduction of the Fit for Work services is an important step in supporting employees, GPs, and employers to manage sickness absence better.

‘Providing support where it’s needed most will help to reduce the amount of time employees take off sick, which in turn will cut sick pay costs, improve economic output, and reduce the chances of people falling out of work and having to claim benefits.’

Dr Maureen Baker, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said: 'Enabling people to return to work is good for their long-term health.

'However, many patients require active support to be able to return to work. It must not become the job of GPs to police who is and who is not entitled to welfare support.' 

The British Medical Association, who have been in negotiations with ministers over the scheme, said it would boycott the plans if they forced people back into work. Richard Vautrey, deputy chairman of the BMA’s GP committee warned minister against bowing to ‘political pressure’ to be punitive.

Dr Vautrey said it was ‘a myth’ that thousands of patients were gaming the system.

He said: ‘If GPs feel that this is a helpful and supportive service with occupational advisers who are very much on the side of the patient and doing their best, then GPs will support it.

‘If they feel it’s somehow a punitive or lip-service arrangement without any meaningful support, or is seen as an arm of the benefits system to effectively drive people off benefits, then GPs will very quickly disengage.’ 

David Cameron warned three years ago that a sicknote culture in the workplace is acting as a ‘conveyor belt to a life on benefits’.

He said at least one in five of the 300,000 people absent on long term sick leave should either have not been signed off in the first place or could go back to work.

The Prime Minister said it was frustrating for GPs as well as business as doctors ‘want to focus on making people better, not spend their time policing the benefit system.’

The programme, if rolled out, stands to receive up to £34 million a year in a payment-by-results scheme.

Lena Levy, the CBI’s head of labour market policy, said the medical profession and businesses needed to work together on long term sick leave. 

She said the CBI had previously called on the government ‘to encourage GPs to consider the service as a default option for those absent for four weeks or more and look towards mandating this in the future.’
