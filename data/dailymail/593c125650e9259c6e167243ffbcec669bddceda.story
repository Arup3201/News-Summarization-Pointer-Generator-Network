Number one: Agatha Christie has been voted the best ever crime writer by members of the Crime Writers Association

Agatha Christie has scooped the award for the best ever whodunit for one of her early Hercule Poirot novels - The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd.

As well as winning the gong for best ever crime novel, Agatha Christie was also voted the number one crime writer of all time.

Christie wrote 66 detective novels and 14 short story collections over her career. She also wrote six romances under the name Mary Westmacott but remains best known for her crime fiction.

But she missed out on the 'best ever crime series' - with the accolade going to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle for Sherlock Holmes.

He wrote four full-length novels and 56 short stories on the master sleuth's adventures between 1887 and 1927.

The results of the Crime Writers Association poll of 600 fellow writers was announced at the society's 60th birthday celebrations.

And despite being written in 1926, it was decided that The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd remains the greatest example of the genre to this day.

In the novel, Poirot is called upon to investigate the village murder of Ackroyd whose untimely demise came hard on the heels of the death of that of the wealthy widow he had been hoping to marry.

Rivals for the award included The Silence of the Lambs by Thomas Harris and two novels by Raymond Chandler.

But critics have questioned why the poll failed to include popular modern Scandinavian crime writers such as Stieg Larsson who wrote The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo trilogy and Jo Nesbo who penned Police.'

Alison Joseph, chair of the CWA, said Christieâ€™s 'elegant precision and her perfect sense of place' continues to ensure her title as one of the best crime writers of all time.

A classic: The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd is one of Christie's first to feature detective Hercule Poirot, played in a long-running ITV series by David Suchet pictured, and has been voted the best crime novel ever written

She told the Independent: 'The fact is, our genre continues to be so popular precisely because of its long and rich history, and our winners reflect that.

'The Holmes/Watson double act is unbeatable, which is why it has been borrowed, re-written and reworked by numerous authors for at least a century.'

Christie still remains the best-selling novelist of all time, according to the Guinness Book of World Records.

Her novels have sold roughly four billion copies, and her estate claims that her works rank third in the most-widely published books after those of William Shakespeare and the Bible.

According to Index Translationum, Christie is also the most-translated individual author with her books translated into at least 103 languages.

And Then There Were None is Christie's best-selling novel with 100 million sales to date, making it the world's best-selling mystery ever, and one of the best-selling books of all time.

In 1955, Christie was the first recipient of the Mystery Writers of America's highest honour, the Grand Master Award, and in the same year Witness for the Prosecution was given an Edgar Award by the MWA for Best Play.

Many of her books and short stories have been filmed, and many have been adapted for television, radio, video games and comics.
