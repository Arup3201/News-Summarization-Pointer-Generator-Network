The mother of an 18-month-old girl who suffered second degree burns from touching a metal plate surrounding a tree outside a public swimming pool  was told 'this is not the first time it's happened'.

Corrine Withers says when she informed the City of Sydney about her daughter Zali's accident in Prince Alfred Park at Surry Hills  she was told the council had known about the hazard for months.

Three weeks after the incident, as Sydney starts to swelter through summer, the dangerous metal bases around nine palm trees at a cafe near the pool - including the one on which Zali was severely burned - are still there.

Adorable: Zali Thomas suffered terrible burns when she touched a hot metal plate in Prince Alfred Park at Surry Hills.

Zali Thomas suffered second degree burns when she touched a hot metal plate surrounding a tree outside Prince Alfred Park at Surry Hills on November 14.

'She let out a blood-curdling scream.' Zali's mother Corrine Withers said her daughter screamed in agony when she touched a hot metal plate in a Surry Hills park.

Ms Withers took Zali to the park with a friend and her friend's two young sons on November 14, a Friday afternoon when temperatures in the city topped 30 degrees Celcius. The children had been playing near the entrance to the park's pool when Zali wandered a short distance about 1pm. 

'I followed her but she tripped and put her hands down to save herself,' Ms Withers told Daily Mail Australia. Zali placed her right hand on a metal plate surrounding the base of a palm tree. 

'She let out a blood-curdling scream,' the 34-year-old said. 'I knew she was badly hurt, but at that stage I had no idea why. After I picked her up, she started shaking and wiping her hand on me.

'When I looked at her hand, the whole palm and finger tips looked as if they had melted instantly.

'I rushed her into the pool where a lifeguard and first aid officer assisted immediately. We ran her hand under cold water for what seemed like a while.' Zali was screaming in pain.

'At this point, [the lifeguard] advised me that "this is not the first time its happened",' Ms Withers said.

Ms Withers' friend rushed the mother and daughter to Sydney Children's Hospital at Randwick where Zali was given pain relief and treated for second degree burns. 

Ms Withers had to take Zali back to the hospital about 7.30pm after Zali pulled off the bandaging on her wounds. Her daughter was given more pain relief.

'They said the burns would need to be "de-roofed" as the blisters had already filled with too much fluid,' Ms Withers said. 'So they then drained and cut the blisters off leaving raw, burned skin. An extremely painful experience yet again.'

To ensure her burns healed properly, her hand was wrapped in an uncomfortable splint which bent her palm backwards. 

Ms Withers, from Redfern, emailed Lord Mayor Clover Moore's office three days later, on November 17, expressing concern another child could be injured on one of the metal plates in the park. 

When she followed up that email with a telephone call to Cr Moore's office during her lunch break the same day, Ms Withers was told the Lord Mayor was 'very concerned'.

In a voicemail left later that day, a council staffer member told Ms Withers the City knew of the hazard presented by the metal plates and had been trying to fix the problem 'for months'. 

'Staff have been working on some solutions for some time and unfortunately everything seems to be heating up in the warm weather,' the staff member said.

The next day, Ms Withers took Zali back to Sydney Children's Hospital where the toddler's hand was cleaned and re-dressed. The splint she had been forced to wear remained on her hand for more than two weeks.

'When I looked at her hand, the whole palm and finger tips looked as if they had melted instantly.' Corrine Withers says her daughter Zali's hand blistered immediately upon her touching a metal plate surrounding a tree in Prince Alfred Park at Surry Hills.

Little Zali Thomas suffered second degree burns when she touched a hot metal plate surrounding a palm tree in Prince Alfred Park, Surry Hills, on November 14.

Burn victim Zali Thomas had to be taken back to Sydney Children's Hospital on the night of November 14 after she pulled off the bandages covering wounds sustained by touching a hot metal plate outside the pool in Prince Alfred Park at Surry Hills.

A week after Zali's accident, on November 21, Ms Withers received a personal email from Cr Moore, headed 'Injury, Prince Alfred Park'.

'Dear Corrine,' Cr Moore wrote. 'I am sorry to hear about your daughter’s injury while playing at Prince Alfred Park. I appreciate how distressing this must be for you both.

'I asked City staff to investigate and update me as a matter of urgency. City staff have removed the metal tree base on which your daughter burnt her hand and replaced it with bark. 

'Over the next week, staff will remove all other metal bases and replace them with an alternative heat resistant material.

'Please accept my best wishes for your daughter’s full and fast recovery.'

The metal base council staff removed from one of the trees in the 7.5 hectare park was not the one on which Zali burned her hand.

Zali Thomas had to  have her hand bent backwards in a splint after suffering burns when she touched a hot metal plate surrounding a tree in Prince Alfred Park at Surry Hills.

Lord Mayor Clover Moore assured Corrine Withers on November 21 the metal base on which her daughter Zali burnt her hand a week earlier had since been removed. It was still there on December 5.

A week later, on November 28, Ms Withers received another email from council stating the metal bases would be removed and replaced with 'water porous paving' on December 8 and 9, almost a month after Zali was burned.

Until then, 'staff are speaking with the cafe operator about carefully placing the fencing, umbrellas and tables so as to “block” access to the metal bases' the email said.

A low fence surrounds the trees but part of one of the 63cm wide plates was still outside that fence when Daily Mail Australia visited the park on Friday. Ms Withers said: 'If kids are inside, they are going to be hurt'.

Ms Withers said the colour and matt finish of the plates almost matched the surrounding surface, disguising the danger of the metal once it heated up. 'There is no way you would have thought that was metal,' she said.

'Looking back at those photos (of Zali's injuries) breaks my heart my every time. She didn't know pain like that. She'd never been burned before. 

Little Zali Thomas is recovering from the burns she suffered when she touched a harmless-looking metal plate around a tree in Prince Alfred Park at Surry Hills.

Ms Withers said her priority in raising the issue was to prevent another child being burned.

'I was absolutely heartbroken to see my little girl in so much pain,' she said. 'Later I felt guilty, like I had somehow failed her. Maybe I should have felt these bases first? Or stopped her from going near them?

'Then I was angry. Why were these things there at a children's playground? I don't want any other littler person getting hurt.

'It seems like they're in no hurry. This happened three weeks ago and they're still there.' 

The plates have been in place since 2011, a City of Sydney spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia.

'The City has removed metal tree root guards from the base of 20 palm trees around the Prince Alfred Park Pool and cafe following concerns they were becoming too hot,' the spokesman said.

'The roots have been covered with mulch or rubber while purpose-made root guards are fabricated.'

The pool at Prince Alfred Park, which has won architectural and design awards, was opened in May last year after a troubled $9 million redevelopment that began in October 2009. The opening was delayed so long that for the first six months of its operation, users were able to use the facilities for free. 

The City of Sydney has said the metal plates surrounding nine trees outside a cafe in Prince Alfred Park will be removed and replaced with 'water porous paving'.
