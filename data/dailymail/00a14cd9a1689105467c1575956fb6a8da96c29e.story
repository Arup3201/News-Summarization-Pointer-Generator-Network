These ghastly photographs are likely to cause ripples across the art world.

They were taken by Andrey Antov who spent ten years building his collection of extraordinary images by photographing rock formations reflected in water.

One, taken at the Rila and Pirin Mountains in Bulgaria, earned the nickname the 'devil' when Mr Antov spotted a demonic face after he rotated it 90 degrees.

Another bears an uncanny resemblance to a llama, with tufts of grass making up the animal's furry coat.

Mr Antov, from Oxford in Connecticut, America, said he didn't rely on the computer to enhance the shots, simply using his camera on a tripod.

The 36-year-old explained: 'It all started when I went on a field trip and took the image of the 'devil'.

'I noticed the face by chance a few days later after developing the image and turning it 90 degrees on one side.

'Afterwards this I began to find more faces in the rocks.

'It's taken me more than 10 years to build up the collection because the images are not easy to spot.

'I try to spot the faces when there is a perfect reflection. This is more likely in a lake and when there is no wind.

'Then I place my camera on a tripod and set the self timer.

'It's pretty simple, it doesn't involve Photoshop or other alteration techniques.'

He added: 'I've had a great reaction to the pictures. People have been very surprised that it is possible.'
