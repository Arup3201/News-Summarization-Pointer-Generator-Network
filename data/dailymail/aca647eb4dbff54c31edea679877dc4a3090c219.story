A man paralysed from the waist down after being crushed during the World Trade Centre rebuild has miraculously completed a gruelling walk - thanks to a $70,000 bionic suit.

Architect Robert Woo was working on Goldman Sachs' World Trade Center headquarters in New York on December 14, 2007, when a crane collapsed sending seven tons of steel plummeting 25 storeys onto his makeshift office.

Rescuers found Robert folded in half underneath the rubble - his head by his knees and his spine crushed. Doctors told him he would never walk again.

Bionic man: Robert Woo defied the odds and walked more than a mile for charity as part of Generosity NYC - an event in New York which raises money for numerous charities

But on November 17, Robert, now 45, incredibly defied the odds and walked more than a mile for charity as part of Generosity NYC - an event in New York which raises money for numerous charities.

He used a bionic suit, called ReWalk, which is equipped with motion sensors detecting when patients are ready to take a step and then uses a number of motors and gears to take the step for them.

Following his accident Robert sank into depression - he said life as a paraplegic was not one he was interested in living, spending three months in hospital where he refused to look under the blanket at his legs.

Huge help: Robert said the $70,000 suit reduced his need for everything from bladder to muscle spasm medication, built muscle in his legs and helped him avoid the bowel accidents that had plagued him since he became paralysed

He and his wife also divorced eight months after the accident.

But his depression didn't dissolve his determination to walk again and almost immediately after the accident he started researching treatment for paraplegics.

One solution he came across was bionics, with several companies creating exoskeletal suits helping patients get out of their wheelchairs and on their feet.

Robert, who no longer works with the same architectural firm, helped bring a trial program to Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, where he was undergoing outpatient treatment.

In October 2011, he took his first steps since the accident and over the next six months trained with the ReWalk three times a week, two hours at a time.

Challenge: Robert walked the 1.06 mile course in 58 minutes and six seconds

He called the training regime 'life-changing' and said using ReWalk reduced his need for everything from bladder to muscle spasm medication, built muscle in his legs and helped him avoid the bowel accidents that had plagued him since he became paralysed.

Robert, using the $70,000 bionic suit, walked the 1.06 mile course in 58 minutes and six seconds.

He said: 'Finishing the walk brought tears to my eyes - it gave me a sense of purpose.

'When I saw the ReWalk suit and saw someone paralysed walking, my eyes opened up and I thought 'wow - I want to walk.'

'At the time of the accident things went black - I knew being paralysed meant more than just losing the use of your limbs.

Determined: Following his accident Robert sank into depression - he said life as a paraplegic was not one he was interested in living - but refused to give up his dream of walking again

'It's not a life I wanted to go through.

'I was bedridden, not doing anything, all I felt is a lot of pain and it wasn't a life I wanted to continue.

'Like a baby I was helpless - I had to be fed, I had to be changed, washed and cleaned up. I'd lost my manhood.

'I was just a wreck and hated being in this life unable to function completely.

'Now my quality of life has improved so much. It's a feeling of being able to be like everyone else.'
