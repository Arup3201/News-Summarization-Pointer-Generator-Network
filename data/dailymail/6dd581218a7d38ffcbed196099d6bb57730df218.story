A glamour model has spoken of how her career was shattered in an instant when she was paralysed in a freak accident while out clubbing.

Lolly Mack, 40, from North London, was left in a wheelchair and with severely limited movement in her upper body when a fellow clubber high on drink and drugs fell from a balcony and landed directly on top of her.

She said: ‘I didn't want to live at 
first after being told I would need 24 hour care, using a catheter and 
being washed and dressed.

Lolly Mack, 40, a former glamour model, was paralysed from the neck down when a man fell from a balcony and landed on top of her in a nightclub in London in 2004

‘But my family said “let's fight this until one day you get back on your feet again”. From that day I just thought that is it! Fight it will be!’

She is now on a huge fundraising drive to raise funds into spinal research in the hope like people such as her will one day be able to walk again.

Ms Mack, who was just 30 at the time, was in a nightclub in Central London in 2004 when Philip Brady, who had been taking ecstasy and drinking heavily, landed on top of her.

She says she felt a sudden ‘thud’ on her neck and shoulders and fell to the ground as she was hit by the 6ft 3ins man.

'My initial thought was that I'd been punched and I remember falling backwards,' she says.

'But when I hit the floor I knew something was dreadfully wrong as I could do nothing other than blink.

Ms Mack, who was 30 at the time of the accident, suffered a broken neck and her spinal cord was compressed. She had emergency surgery to stabilise her neck and then spent ten months in rehabilitation (pictured)

'My friends were encouraging me to get up, but I became increasingly distressed as I realised I couldn't.'

Ms Mack, who appeared on MTV as well a model in various national newspapers,  was rushed to King's College Hospital in south London, where she underwent six hours of emergency surgery to stabilise her neck.

She was told her neck had been broken and her spinal cord compressed.

She told MailOnline: 'I think there was something telling me not to go out that night - I didn't really want to go and my gut feeling was that I shouldn't.

'But I didn't want to let my boyfriend down so I went anyway.'

She added: 'I knew immediately something was terribly wrong when I was lying on the floor. It was completely terrifying.

'The first thing I asked the paramedics was if I was going to be in a wheelchair but they said it was too soon to say.

'Being in the hospital was daunting - it was like a scene from Casualty. I knew by that point that it was quite serious.'

The day after her injury, Ms Mack was moved to Stoke Mandeville Hospital, in Buckinghamshire, where she spent 10 months in rehabilitation.

When she arrived at the hospital she was unable to move anything other than her head.

She said: 'I thought I couldn't live like that. I thought it was the end of my life. I was crying buckets.

'I was not accepting it, I didn't want to hear about it and I was in denial. I think most people feel suicidal in that position. It was awful.'

Ms Mack (pictured in rehabilitation) says her dream is to eventually walk again and to regain her independence

Despite the treatment and a strict exercise regime, she only regained some of the movement in her arms and none of the movement in her legs.

And while she can now move her arms a little, she is still unable to move her wrists or her hands.

She lives with her family and has carers who come in every day to help her wash and dress.

She also suffers from neuropathic pain - pain caused by a problem with the signals from the nerves - 24 hours a day, from the shoulders down.

Mr Brady was found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm and was jailed for two years.

Ms Mack told MailOnline: 'I don't let him ruin my life - I don't think about it. He was never really apologetic but I don't wish bad upon him and I don't want to be ruined by anger.

Philip Brady, the man who fell on Ms Mack, was found guilty of causing GBH and was jailed for two years

'I do sometimes wonder what I did to deserve it, you think "why me?".

'I had so many gut instincts telling me not to go out but I ignored them - it happened and there is nothing I can do about that now.'

She now dedicates her time to raising awareness of spinal cord injuries and to raising money for research into a cure.

She said: 'My hope and my dream is getting back on my feet and regaining my independence.

'We rely on as much money being raised as possible - it is all about finding a cure.

'I live my life to the fullest I can - I love travelling, beauty, and I have even met a new guy which I am really happy about.

Ms Mack (pictured in hospital) says she does her best to live life to the full despite her injury

'I am trying to have as many fun, happy times as possible while waiting for a cure.

'I can still have fun and enjoy life and be grateful that I wasn't killed but I have great hope as I know it's not a case of if we find a cure, it's a case of when.'

On May 31 Ms Mack will be holding an event in Central London to raise money for the charity Spinal Research.

Tickets are on sale for £60 and the party will be held at the Yager Bar near St Paul's Cathedral where there will be champagne, canapes and performances from a range of musicians.
