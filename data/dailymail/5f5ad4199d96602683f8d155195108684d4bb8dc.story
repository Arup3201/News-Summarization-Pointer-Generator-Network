Andy Murray hit the practice court on Monday hours after his thrilling fourth-round victory at the Australian Open.

Murray sealed his place in the last eight at 12:23am on Monday morning with a hard-fought four-set victory against Bulgarian star Grigor Dimitrov.

And the British No 1 was back on the outside courts of Melbourne Park at 3pm on Monday afternoon for a 60-minute practice session.

The Australian newspapers rarely pass up an opportunity to have a go at the Brits - so it is no surprise that they are stirring things up ahead of Tuesday night's blockbuster quarter-final between Andy Murray and home hope Nick Kyrgios.

The back page of Tuesday's Daily Telegraph goes with the headline 'Brit Pop' as they run an exclusive column with Kyrgios on 'How I'll burst Andy's bubble'.

The 19-year-old says: 'Hopefully everyone now knows there is a fighter behind the showman and I want this badly.'

Coach Amelie Mauresmo, trainer Matt Little and physio Mark Bender were watching on as Murray hit with 18-year-old Australian Blake Mott on Court 18.

Murray heads back to the Rod Laver Arena on Tuesday for a blockbuster night session quarter-final clash with Australian teenager Nick Kyrgios, which will get under way at 7:15pm (8:15am UK time).

The pair have played before with Murray comfortably winning 6-2, 6-2 in the last 32 of the Toronto Masters last August - but the Scot is expecting a more raucous occasion in front of the passionate Aussie crowd this time.

Murray said: 'I would expect it to be a different match, Obviously it's best of five sets.

'It was a fairly empty stadium when we played in Toronto. I think Nick enjoys playing in front of a crowd. So that will probably change things a bit, too.

'Obviously it was on a hard court, and there were some things that I did in that match which I believe will work in a couple days' time.

'So I've learnt stuff from playing against him there and at the IPTL and watching him a bit, stuff that I feel I can use and exploit in his game.'
