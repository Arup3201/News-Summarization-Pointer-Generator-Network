Rafael Nadal suffered a painful hand injury during the quarter final of the Australian Open tennis tournament in Melbourne today.

The Spaniard was seen receiving medical care for a nasty-looking wound in the palm of his racquet hand, thought to have been caused by a callous blister.

Despite his injury, the 27-year-old, beat Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov in the match and is through to the semi-final.

Care: Rafael Nadal receives medical attention during the game in Melbourne after a blister appeared in the palm of his racquet hand

Nadal played with taped up fingers to 
fend off blisters, but ended up with an open wound after a blister burst
 in the palm of his hand during the game.

Although
 the injury sometimes appeared to affect his feel for the ball during an
 undulating quarter final, he won by do 3-6, 7-6, 7-6, 6-2 against the 
22-year-old Bulgarian.

'I 
was very lucky in the tiebreak, on one set point he missed an easy 
forehand, I felt anything could happen. My hand affects the serve, the 
rest of things are more or less fine,’ Nadal told MailOnline.

‘I
 will have to try and improve the hand in the next two days. I can 
practice but the problem is if I don’t protect the hand it will get 
worse.

Injury: Nadal's blister is believed to have been cause by a callus torn off by the movement of the raquet

Powering through: Despite the injury sustained to his hand, Nadal beat Bulgarian Dimitrov with 3-6, 7-6, 7-6, 6-2

Frequent tennis 
players and professionals get calluses on their hands, which can become 
mobile if the hardened skin grows an edge.

As
 the callus moves on top of another layer of skin, blisters develop 
underneath. When this happens, the movement of the racquet can tear off 
the callus, which is thought to be the case of Nadal.

‘Then
 you’ve got a wound as opposed to a blister,’ Association of Tennis 
Professionals physiotherapist Paul Ness told Atpworldtour.com.

‘Any
 time you end up with an open wound it’s going to be painful - and 
really difficult to pad and have the dressing stay in place.’

These
 injuries can be prevented by covering the affected area, however, the 
palms of the hand are ‘close to impossible to effectively cover,’ the 
website said.

The tournament is taking place amid a crippling heatwave, with temperatures exceeding 40C in Melbourne last week.

Players
 have complained of ‘inhumane’ conditions after one hallucinated, 
claiming he could see cartoon character Snoopy mid-match, a ball boy 
fainted, one player vomited, and drink bottles melted on court.

It
 was during a qualifier in the first round that Canadian player Frank 
Dancevic hallucinated then fainted during his match against Frenchman 
Benoit Paire.

He was unconscious for almost a minute but returned to the court before losing the match.

Meanwhile, Andy Murray's girlfriend Kim Sears was less than pleased with the attention as she watched her boyfriend play Roger Federer in another quarterfinal in Melbourne today.

Andy Murray's partner of eight years became so annoyed with a nearby camera that she attempted to cover it with a baseball cap, before enlisting the help of a fellow attendee who wrapped it in a towel.
