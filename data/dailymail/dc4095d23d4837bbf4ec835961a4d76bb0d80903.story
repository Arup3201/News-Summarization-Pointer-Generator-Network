The apparent suicide of a man awaiting deportation sparked a protest by more than 200 inmates at a detention centre yesterday.

Protesters claimed staff at Morton Hall in Lincolnshire had delayed calling a doctor after the 21-year-old complained of headaches.

By the time a woman officer got to him, he had hanged himself, detainees claimed last night.

Shortly after breakfast about half the detainees congregated in the exercise yard to protest. Officers in riot gear were called in and fire crews stood by. Staff were moved to a safe area of the centre.

The Home Office confirmed the death of the man, thought to be from Bangladesh, will be investigated.

Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said: 'We take our responsibilities towards detainees' welfare extremely seriously.'

'We take our responsibilities towards detainees' health and welfare extremely seriously. As is the case with any death in detention a full investigation has been launched.' 

A Home Office spokesman said: 'A disturbance involving a number of detainees is currently ongoing at Morton Hall IRC.

'Specially trained staff have been deployed to bring the situation to a safe conclusion. There are no reported injuries to staff or detainees relating to this incident.'

It has been reported that officers in riot gear with dogs went into the site this afternoon, and that alarms were sounding inside the complex.

Morton Hall, in the village of Swinderby, is run by the Prison Service on behalf of UK Border Agency.

It has 392 rooms spread across six residential units, and holds adult men.
