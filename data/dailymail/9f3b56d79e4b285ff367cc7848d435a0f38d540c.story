Colleagues talking your ear off in the desks surrounding yours aren't just annoyingâ€”they're also destroying your concentration and bringing down overall workplace productivity.

A new study found that 'focus' tasks are harder to accomplish when there are no barriers between employees, such as in open-plan offices, The Independent reported.

Only one in four U.S. workers believe they are in 'optimal' workplace environments, resulting in a decrease in workplace effectiveness since 2008, according to a report by the global design firm Gensler.

Open: Offices that boast less space to individually focus might have a negative impact on U.S workers' concentration

An employee's inability to focus has something to do with poorly-planned workplaces that cause less time away from colleagues so that workers can better concentrate on non-collaborative tasks.

The open-office design became popular in Germany when designers wanted to break the tradition of factory-style desk arrangements facing the same direction toward management, who were comfortable situated in their own offices.

The report, based on responses from more than 2,000 American workers, demonstrates these designs have only made workers more distracted.

'I donâ€™t think it would be going too far out on a limb to say we are at the beginning of a new era in workplace design,' Gensler executive director Diane Hoskins told The Independent.

Open-plan workplaces, which meant to boost collaboration and creative thinking, have actually decreased employee's ability to collaborate, the report shows.

'Not only is the focus mode not functioning optimally in most office environments, we found statistical evidence that the effectiveness of collaboration, learning and socializing suffers if the ability to focus is diminished,' Hoskins said.

A study by the Danish Ministry of Employment found workers in open-plan offices take 62 per cent more sick days than those with their own space.

Unproductive: Open-plan offices originally meant to increase collaboration have actually decreased it

Thirty-one per cent of respondents said they are more satisfied when they can focus. They also see their companies as more 'innovative' when they can focus.

The physical barriers companies have taken down have also been replaced by virtual ones, such as headphones and email, rather than face-to-face, conversations. Social media like Twitter and Facebook have also decreased workplace focus.

Despite Hoskin's beliefs, many companies have still made their offices more open.

Trying to highlight collaborative work, Facebook used a 'non-hierarchical approach' in organizing their new office at the Sun Microsystems California campus. Maximizing space and increasing shared resources, 2,800 engineers share a warehouse with a roof garden.
