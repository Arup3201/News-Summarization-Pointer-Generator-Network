Aston Villa are on the verge of completing the £4.7million signing of defensive midfielder Carlos Sanchez from Elche on Friday.

Subject to final paperwork progressing smoothly, the club hope the deal will be finalised in the coming hours, representing a significant boost for manager Paul Lambert.

Negotiations were complicated by the player’s third-party ownership but details have been ironed out and the player passed his medical.

Thrashed out a deal: Aston Villa are closing in on a deal for Colombian defensive midfielder Carlos Sanchez

Sanchez - known as the Rock for his solidity - has 48 caps for Colombia so there are no work permit issues. He played four times for his nation at the World Cup in Brazil.

Lambert has been keen to reinforce his midfield and Sanchez becomes his fifth summer signing, although he will not feature in the season opener against Stoke on Saturday as he has not trained with the team.

Lambert is hoping to add another fresh face before the close of the transfer window.
