Former Barcelona manager Gerrardo Martino believes Lionel Messi is a dream player to work with because he can play in almost any attacking position.

Messi famously played in the 'false nine' spot for four years at Barcelona when Pep Guardiola, who now manages Bayern Munich, was in control of the Catalan club.

The Argentinian has taken up the No 10 role under manager Luis Enrique on occasions this season, but has also been deployed in wider roles to form a three-pronged attack with Luis Suarez and Neymar.

Martino, who is a coach for Argentina, knows all about the 27-year-old having worked with both on the international and domestic scene and admits Messi is effective in almost every attacking role.

'For a long time we haven't seen him be as absolutely crucial as he was against Manchester City on Wednesday,' the coach told Mundo Deportivo.

'He can play on the right, left, as a No.9, behind the striker, or even as a No.4! He is able to make the difference anywhere on the pitch.'

Martino also admitted it is often best to give him as much freedom in his role as possible, he said: 'Sometimes, it is logical that by analysing a player one thinks it is better to play him in one place or another, but then, if he is good, you can be more flexible.

'The reality is that his effectiveness is down to him rather than where he is put on the pitch by the coach.'
