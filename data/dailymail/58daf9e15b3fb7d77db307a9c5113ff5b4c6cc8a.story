The newly opened National September 11 Memorial Museum in New York City was forced to remove a commemorative cheese plate from its gift shop after receiving complaints from the victims’ relatives.

The objectionable souvenir was a decorative ceramic platter in the shape of the United States, with heart symbols marking the spots where the hijacked planes struck on 9/11: downtown Manhattan, the Pentagon and a field in rural Pennsylvania.

Memorial Foundation President Joe Daniels told the Wall Street Journal the museum will enlist more help of 9/11 family members who sit on the foundation's board in vetting the merchandise.

Cheesy gift: National September 11 Memorial Museum's gift shop decided to remove from its shelves a decorative cheese platter in the shape of the United States, with heart symbols marking the spots where the hijacked planes struck on 9/11

Angered: Many 9/11 survivors and victims are upset that a gift shop is part of the new museum and memorial at the Ground Zero site

Merchandise: The gift shops a wide variety of souvenirs, including NYPD dog vests and earrings

Damage control: The head of the memorial foundation has vowed to enlist the help of 9/11 family members to help vet the gift shop merchandise

According to Daniels, the gift shop is needed to help support the operations of the museum, which opened its doors to the public last Wednesday following a ceremony attended by President Barack Obama.

Mr Daniels pointed out to Wall Street Journal that many visitors want to take home a keepsake to remember the experience.

The museum gift shop, which also operates an online store, offers a wide variety of souvenirs, including mugs, keychains, hooded sweatshirts and plush search-and-rescue dogs.

The very idea of a shop peddling 9/11-themed knickknacks, most of them made overseas, has been the subject of a heated public debate.

Since the grand opening of the memorial, survivors of the tragedy and family members of the fallen have lambasted the idea of hawking merchandise for profit so close to the site's hallowed ground. 

Some 8,000 human remains belonging to unidentified victims of the attack had been entombed in the bedrock beneath the exhibition space.

‘It's hard for me to accept that all of those things are in the same place where the remains are,’ said Rosaleen Tallon, who lost her firefighter brother on 9/11.

According to the museum's website, the proceeds from gift shop sales benefit 'developing and sustaining' the memorial, which is headed by executives who earn privately-funded six-figure salaries.

The museum plans to operate on a $63million budget with money raised through admission fees and donations.

The gift shop was funded with a $5million donation from Paul Napoli and Marc Bern, partners in a law firm which made $200,0000 representing 10,000 Ground Zero workers in a lawsuit.
