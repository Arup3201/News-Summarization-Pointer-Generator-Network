A fashion-loving cancer sufferer, who chose to greet each day of her final year of life with a new outfit, has passed away after living more than two years past doctors' predictions.

Kim Ferguson, the face behind KLF Design who lived by the motto 'don't give up, dress up', died on March 14 at the age of 57, a decade after her first cancer diagnosis.

The NSW Central Coast mother's two daughters, Elle and Lucie, shared a touching tribute on her Instagram page where hundreds of her unique outfits were displayed daily.

It was liked by almost 2000 of Kim's supporters, hundreds of which shared their love and condolences.

'Mum taught us how to breathe, how to walk, talk and hug,' Lucie wrote, adding 'she taught us to shop when our worlds were crumbling.'

'She taught us the strength to go on, no matter the challenges presented to her in life she kept going, showing her girls that we could keep going either side of her, displaying strength and bravery one reserved for battle. She taught us that three hearts beat as one.

'Mumma you will always be with Elle and I for you reside in us, we carry your heart, we carry it in our hearts… we love you mum.'

Her daughter Elle is one half of fashion blog They All Hate Us, while Lucie is the designer behind boutique jewellery outlet Baby Anything. 

On Friday the sisters revealed that the last project they had worked on with their mother, an accessories label that helped to distract her from her illness, had finally been launched

When Kim  found out she had one year to live after a long battle with cancer, she decided to count down her days in a unique way 

'Today my sister and I said 'we'll see you soon mum...' One of the hardest days of my life but was surrounded by love... We dressed in our best for the best @kimlouiseferguson ... And one day at a time,' Elle wrote on her own Instagram page on the day of her mother's funeral. 

On Friday the sisters revealed that the last project they had worked on with their mother, an accessories label that helped to distract her from her illness, had finally been launched.

'I am driven to get @klf_design out there because it means my mum is still out there in the world,' the Instagram post read. 

Kim first began her Instagram page when she was given 12 months to live, refusing to 'sit at home and die', and deciding she would battle her cancer with 'one outfit at a time'.

With help from her two daughters, she began documenting her outfits, putting her love for fashion and her zest for life on show to inspire herself, and others. 

She explained that rather than 'sit at home and die', she would battle her cancer with 'one outfit at a time'

Outfit 6 & 14: Kim was given 12 months to live and was not the type of person to 'sit at home and die'

'For me it was an outlet, because I'd always been into fashion, it was part of my identity,' Kim told Daily Mail Australia in January. 

'I think the cancer takes your identity, it becomes who you are.

'Then you're put into a box by the type of cancer you have, and then you're a terminal patient and you're put into that box.

'I was trying to claim back a bit of my identity.'

The bio on her Instagram page reads: 'Beating cancer one outfit at a time. Prognosis 12 mths to my expiry date. I choose fashion! It may not be brain surgery, but it sure beats chemo!' 

Kim's journey with cancer began more than a decade ago when she was diagnosed with colorectal cancer which led her to endure three 'quite full-on operations'.

Doctors were shocked that someone who lived such a healthy lifestyle - Kim was passionate about yoga, swimming, and had always been a vegetarian and light drinker - could develop such a disease.

A few years after being given the all-clear for the first time, the mother-of-two fell very ill again, forced to leave her job as a high school teacher for the second time.

'It was bowel cancer this time and moved further up into my body, also into my pelvis and cervix,' Kim said.

As part of a trial study she underwent chemotherapy and radiation at the same time, because she was deemed strong enough to withstand such strong therapy.

Then a few years later Kim was back in hospital once again and a glimmer of hope was seen by her and her girls.

After trying a strict juice therapy known as the Gerson Protocol in an attempt to get well enough to access treatment in San Diego she was told that she may not need travel, and that what was making her ill was a treatable ulcer.

'We were in absolute shock, the girls were around my hospital bed when they told us it was just an ulcer. We were overjoyed.'

Outfit 154: This was around the point the 57-year-old started her Instagram, as an outlet for herself but which quickly turned into a support network for others

However 24 hours later the Fergusons' world was turned upside down again when they were told Kim was so unwell that 90 percent of the organs below her waist had to be removed.

'I have no bowel, no bladder, only part of my stomach, I had organs removed I didn't even know I had.'

This was around the point the 57-year-old started her Instagram account as an outlet for herself but which quickly turned into a support network for others.

Left to right outfits 161 and outfit 166: Making an effort to get up and get dressed even if it just meant walking around the house in her favourite pair of heels for a few hours, Kim was always motivated to keep moving

'I actually started the Instagram about two years ago, I started it the first time I was told I wasn't going to survive,' Kim said.

'When they told me that I thought well 'what do you do?'

'I met people who had sat at home and died. The girls and I were like that's just not going to happen.'

Left to right outfits 167 and 168: The central coast woman said the days she documented were when she felt most herself

Making an effort to get up and get dressed even if it just meant walking around the house in her favourite pair of heels for a few hours, Kim was always motivated to keep moving.

'I think it's just an amazing way to connect...the thing is about getting up and getting dressed and being happy,' she said.

'I guess I just want people to do what makes them happy, everyone has something that makes them happy and I don't want cancer to take that away from them.'
