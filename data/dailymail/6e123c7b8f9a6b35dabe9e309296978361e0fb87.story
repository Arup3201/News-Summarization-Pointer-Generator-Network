The majority of the rumours about Apple’s upcoming devices have centred on what the iPhone 6 will look like - but the tech giant is also expected to launch a new iPad at an event in September.

Mock-up images of what this next-generation iPad Air casing may look like have appeared on Chinese site Weibo.

Despite a number of small tweaks to the volume controls and microphone, the case looks almost identical to the current super-thin model that went on sale in November last year.

The mockup images (pictured) were posted to Chinese site Weibo and claim to show a next-generation iPad Air case. In this image, the camera lens is pictured in the top left-hand corner with a small hole next to it. This hole, purported to be for the rear microphone, is similar to those seen on the rear of the iPhone 5S and 5C

Apple's iPhone 6 is rumoured to come in a slim 'Air' version.

Up
 until August last year, Huawei was the record-holder for the thinnest 
phone in the world with its Ascend P6, at 0.24 inches (6.18 
millimetres).

This was then replaced by the Vivo X3 at just 0.23 inches (5.75 millimetres). 

By
 comparison, Apple’s current iPhone 5S has a depth of 0.3 inches (7.6 
millimetres), while the iPad Air is slightly thinner at 0.295 inches 
(7.5 millimetres).

Samsung's Galaxy S5 is 0.32 inches (8.1 millimetres) thick, while the HTC One M8 is 0.37 inches (9.4 millimetres).

It is not known whether the images are of a real iPad or whether they are just a designer's musing on what Apple's next offering will be.

Two images show what the casing may look like from a distance, while a close-up image reveals the case’s depth.

In the image that shows the exterior of the rear case, the camera lens is pictured in the top left-hand corner with a small hole next to it.

This hole, purported to be for the rear microphone, is similar to those seen on the rear of the iPhone 5S and 5C.

By comparison, the current microphone on the iPad Air is positioned in the centre, at the top of the rear case.

On the leaked image of the case's interior, two holes along the top right-hand side of the case are believed to be where the volume controls will sit.

The controls on the current iPad Air are raised, but these holes suggest the next-generation controls will be built flush with the case.

Aside from these minor tweaks, the size and thickness of the case appears to be the same.

A close-up image (pictured left) reveals the case’s depth. The iPad Air (pictured near right) is 20 per cent thinner than previous models, and Apple is expected to launch an equally super-thin iPhone, dubbed iPhone Air at an event in September.

Previous rumours have suggested the next-generation tablet will feature the fingerprint scanner first introduced on the iPhone 5S, and a faster A8 processor.

Apple is expected to launch its next-generation iPad and iPhone models at an event in September. 

Analysts believe Apple is working on two versions of different sizes for its iPhone 6, with one being 4.7 inches (11.9cm) diagonally - the same size as the HTC One.

A larger version is also expected to be released, measuring 5.5 inches (14cm) - slightly larger than Samsung's 5.1-inch Galaxy S5. 

In April, Taiwan-based Commercial Times similarly referenced a 2mm-thick battery. 

The iPad Air is 20 per cent thinner than previous models, and Apple is expected to launch an equally super-thin iPhone, dubbed iPhone Air.

This is expected to be the smaller of the two handsets.

IPad sales slumped 9 per cent in the last quarter, according to the tech giant’s latest earnings report, amid reports demand for the technology is waning.

Previous rumours have pointed to a super slim 'iPhone Air' model, inspired by the current iPad Air. Taiwan-based Commercial Times referenced a 2mm-thick battery in April. Designer Martin Hajek's iPhone 6 concept is pictured left next to the current iPhone 5S
