Bali police have confirmed they searched a man at the scene of a drug bust that resulted in Sydney woman Leeza Ormsby being charged with drug possession - but let him go because he was not a suspect.

The Australian man named Marco Mazzucco, a Sydney DJ and reportedly Ms Ormsby's ex-lover, turned up at the villa after police arrived, an officer confirmed. He has since left Bali.

Ms Ormsby, 37, is on trial for drugs possession charges carrying a jail term of up to 12 years after being arrested with 'half of a joint' of marijuana.

The Australian resident was arrested at the scene of a drug bust in February after a police tip-off and Bali police have confirmed they searched her ex-lover Marco Mazzucco at the scene, but let him go because he was not a suspect

An Australian resident, Ms Ormsby does not plan to fight the charges but has maintained since the February sting that MDMA and hashish found in a Canggu villa did not belong to not her.

But Indonesian police were also trying to link the New Zealand born woman to the other drugs found at the villa, including 132 grams of MDMA and 26 grams of hashish, while she remained in a cramped police cell for months.

On Thursday, the police who arrested Ms Ormsby gave evidence at her trial.

They described how they staked out the villa from 11pm the night before the bust, after being told the occupants, suspected of holding a 'drugs party' were not there.

Police officer Cok Putra Sutrisna told the court Ms Ormsby, who was staying at another villa, arrived in the early morning by motorbike, looking dishevelled.

Ms Ormsby appeared in Denpasar District Court on drug possession charges on Monday May 26, where she was charged with possessing, carrying and using a half-joint of marijuana

The 37-year-old was arrested on February 12 and has since been held in a cramped police cell

'Her physical appearance looked messy with her hair uncombed,' he said. 'She looked like a drunk person.'

Police officer Made Sudiarsa said they approached Ormsby as she was opening the villa door with a key.

When they found the joint in her handbag, the former Paddington shop assistant admitted it was for her own use, the court heard.

But when drugs were found in a cupboard drawer, Ms Ormsby claimed they were not hers.

The drugs appeared to be 'a black chunk of something, a big capsule and four small capsules'.

Brig Sudiarsa confirmed reports a man named Marco (Mazzucco), believed to be Ormsby's Australian ex-lover, then turned up.

'We then searched him and we found nothing, that's why he was released,' he told the court.

After the raid, police promised to investigate the other people who had been at the villa, but they have all since left the holiday island.

Instead, Ms Ormsby's lawyer Ari Soenardi said they kept his client in custody for three months without charges, trying to link her to the other drugs.

She was finally charged in mid-May for only the three offences and denied having any knowledge about the other drugs seized from the scene.

The villa where the large quantity of drugs had been found, was being rented by Sydney rock band frontman Azaria Byrne at the time of the tip-off, but Mr Byrne jetted off to Sydney the night before the stake-out.

Ms Ormsby had received the key to the villa from her former boyfriend, Mr Mazzucco, who denied involvement when being questioned by police and left Indonesia soon afterwards.

Prosecutor Ni Putu Oka Ariani confirmed Ms Ormsby had admitted to smoking the joint police found in her bag.

'The defendant admitted that the joint was given to her by her friend named Robert, with the intention of using it together,' the prosecutor said.

The chief of the three-judge panel, Parulian Saragih, asked Ms Ormsby whether she understood the charges and through an interpreter, the Rotorua-born woman said she did.

Lawyer Ari Soenardi says his client won't fight the charges, but rather aim to receive a reduced sentence due to being a drug victim in need of rehabilitation.

'We will try to show the medical examination test results, which state that the defendant is a narcotics user, and hope for leniency later,' he told reporters outside court.

Ms Ormsby will remain in custody in Kerobokan jail while the trial continues

The court heard that Ms Ormsby often uses hashish, marijuana and ketamine and has twice undergone therapy and rehabilitation for her drug addictions.

Ms Ormsby was relaxed in court on Thursday, wearing a loose-fitting white shirt and carrying a fan that with the word 'paradise' on it.

She told the court through a translator that she did not disagree with the police evidence.

Mr Soenardi says he will ask the court to treat Ms Ormsby as a drug user and consider leniency when sentencing her.

She remained quiet and calm at her court appearance on Monday, May 26, in contrast to her state when she was charged two weeks earlier.

Then, she cried and called out to reporters: 'I want to go home.'

Her flatmates in Sydney, where she was living, have told media that Ms Ormsby had not been working before she suddenly left for Bali, but had spoken of feeling stressed.

The trial continues next week and Ms Ormsby will remain in custody in Kerobokan jail.
