Trial: Pc Rohan Scarlett (pictured), 47, was accused of repeatedly punching Andrew Uba in North London

A Metropolitan Police officer was today found guilty of punching a suspect in the face after he spat in the officer's mouth.

Pc Rohan Scarlett, 47, launched the assault on Andrew Uba as he put him in a police van at 3am while transferring him from Islington police station to custody in Lewisham, east London.

The burly 6ft 1in officer struggled with walking reluctant Uba to the van on February 20 and was helped by a colleague, he said.

But as he put Uba inside the van, without warning, Uba spat at close distance in his face, Scarlett told Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court.

Scarlett, a former nightclub doorman and security guard, said he did not want to be assaulted again and hit Uba to ‘distract him’ from spitting a second time.

Scarlett, who denied common assault, wiped his face of the spit, opened the van door then intentionally ‘launched’ himself at Uba, punching him twice, magistrates heard.

Delivering the verdict, chair of the bench Sue Rose said: ‘We do not accept that the defendant honestly believed that he needed to use force to defend himself in these circumstances.’

The court was shown a photograph from the scene in which a small pool of blood was on the seat where Uba had been sitting.

Scarlett, of Croydon, south London, said Uba trapped his left arm with his handcuffed wrists and pulled him inside the van after being thumped.

The officer said he used his right hand to push away Uba's face three or four times ‘so he couldn't spit at me again’.

The
father of two added that he then wiped the spit from his face and an 
Islington officer who was present at the van, Pc David O'Hara, told him 
he was in ‘a world of trouble’.

Pc O'Hara then ‘grabbed my right wrist and put some cuffs on saying I am under arrest on suspicion of GBH - I was in shock’.

Pc O'Hara said he physically tried to remove Scarlett from the suspect but was not strong enough. He said he told Scarlett after the punch ‘we don't do that’, to which he Scarlett replied, ‘yeah we do’.

Scarlett, who has been an officer for eight years and has an unblemished career, claimed Pc O'Hara was lying.

'This was not self-defence at all. You were so disgusted at being spat at you launched at Mr Uba and punched him'

Dilichi
Onuzo, prosecuting, said: ‘This was not self-defence at all. You were 
so disgusted at being spat at you launched at Mr Uba and punched him.’

The
court heard from colleagues of Scarlett who talked of his calm nature 
and his excellence as a communicator with little need for physical 
violence. The officer is currently suspended from duties.

Sentencing
was adjourned to September 20 and Scarlett was given continued 
unconditional bail. His defence barrister, Tom Godfrey, said his client 
would be appealing the verdict.
