A radio station director was forced to change the colour of her hair after she was left humiliated by her boss’s ‘sexist’ comments about her appearance, a tribunal heard.

John Clayton allegedly told Dawn Carney, 37, that he wished all employees looked like her with blonde hair, ‘big boobs’ and blue eyes. She also accused him of criticising her ‘tacky dress sense and cheap perfume’.

The ‘degrading’ comments forced her to change her hair colour from blonde to brunette, an employment tribunal heard.

Miss Carney is claiming unfair dismissal and sexual harassment against Mr Clayton, the managing director of Star Radio in Darlington, and the station’s parent company UK RD. 

She told the hearing in Newcastle that during the two months she worked with Mr Clayton he made a series of inappropriate or sexually explicit remarks. 

He allegedly told her that she looked more attractive in pictures she had posted of herself on social networks than in person. 

He was also said to have boasted in front of other employees that he yearned for ‘the good old days’ when he had sexual contact with office staff.

Miss Carney told the panel how Mr Clayton made ‘sexist remarks’ in relation to the radio station’s recruitment policy when it was recruiting two sales executives. 

‘When discussing the strategy for recruitment, John stated that he wished for the team to all look like me,’ Miss Carney said.

‘He took the comments further by requesting that the new recruits be blonde, have big boobs and blue eyes. He added that this worked in the good old days and they should make sure it happened here.

Mr Clayton (pictured) would comment on Ms Carney's outfits and whether or not he liked them, she alleged

‘These comments made me feel extremely uncomfortable. I did not like him talking about my appearance in this way. I felt his views on women especially targeted at me as I was the only woman in the sales team.

‘As a result of this I actually changed my hair colour to brown shortly after leaving the business.’

She claimed that Mr Clayton would make sexist comments about women being ‘better at cleaning’ and their role was ‘best at home’.

After a period of illness, Miss Carney returned to work in March last year to be told she was ‘no longer needed as part of the business’ and was to leave with immediate effect. She said she was on the point of resigning when she was ‘effectively beaten to it’ and dismissed for her performance.

Karen Riley, a former sales executive at the station, said there had been a culture of ‘everyday sexism’ in the office.

Edward Legard, for the respondents, said Mr Clayton was ‘professional and courteous’ at all times and Miss Carney’s allegations of sexual harassment were ‘scurrilous fabrications’. He described her claim as ‘wholly opportunistic’.

The hearing continues.
