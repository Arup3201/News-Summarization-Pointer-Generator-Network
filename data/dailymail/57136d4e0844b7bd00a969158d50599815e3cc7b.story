A teacher taking pupils on a school trip in a minibus found herself surrounded by police  and accused of stealing it.

Gillian Hainsworth pulled up at the concert venue, only to be boxed in to the front, rear and side by three police vans.

An officer leapt out, rapped on her window and ordered her to explain why she was driving a stolen vehicle. The 51-year-old was then questioned for 15 minutes as her husband and the 28 pupils looked on anxiously, before police realised there had been a mix-up over the hired minibus.

Officers saw the funny side of the confusion and put handcuffs on Gillian so her pupils could take photos

It had previously been reported stolen and left on the police database by mistake.

Officers
then saw the funny side and put her in handcuffs  so the children could
take photos, which they posted on Facebook. Mrs Hainsworth, a music 
teacher at Tadcaster Grammar School in North Yorkshire, said: ‘When they
said the word “stolen” I couldn’t help but laugh because I knew I had 
not stolen the minibus.

‘And it was so obvious that we were carrying a load of schoolchildren on the bus – what an odd way to use a stolen vehicle.’

The
mix-up happened as Mrs Hainsworth took the pupils on the hour-long 
drive to Halifax Minster, where they were due to perform in a concert 
last Friday. Her husband Mike, 61, was driving some of the children in 
the school bus ahead of her and she was ferrying the rest in the  
minibus.

The mix-up came as Gillian took the pupils on the hour-long drive to Halifax Minster where they were performing in a concert

She said: ‘We 
were looking for the entrance of the minster when we were bombarded by 
police vans. I was racking my brain trying to think of what we might 
have done wrong.‘

She said
one of the officers told her they had been following her for about 15 
minutes.

The confusion was cleared up when police called the hire company

 ‘I was completely shocked. I could see the students all 
grinning in the background – obviously the idea of a teacher nicking a 
minibus was amusing to them.

‘I asked the policeman, “Is this a set-up?” and he replied, “No, this isn’t.” It was all very serious.’

The
confusion was cleared up when police called the hire company, which 
confirmed Mrs Hainsworth’s husband had rented the minibus.

She
added: ‘One of the officers came towards me with his handcuffs and I 
knew he was joking. All the kids got out their mobile phones and took 
pictures – which were all over Facebook soon enough, I hear.

'The jokes 
continued after the performance when the compere announced, “We’ve got 
to let Mrs Hainsworth go now because she’s got to go back to her cell”.’

The teacher said she had no complaint about the officers, who were ‘only doing their job’.

West Yorkshire Police said the  minibus had now been removed from the database.
