A delivery driver is lucky to be alive after his leg was almost ‘eaten alive’ by a rare bacterial infection.

Colin Sines, 46, was infected with necrotising fasciitis, which quickly attacked his right leg.

After feeling a sharp pain while on a shift, the TNT driver realised his leg was swelling up.

Colin Sines, (pictured left) 46, was infected with a disease called necrotising fasciitis, which quickly attacked his right leg. In order to attack the aggressive disease (pictured right), surgeons had to strip disease flesh from Mr Sines' leg below the knee in an emergency operation

When his leg ballooned to twice its normal size within just 30 minutes, he was forced to cut away his boot.

Mr Sines told Get Surrey: ‘It was as if someone had stuck a red-hot poker into me.’

Despite being in excruciating pain, he managed to drive home to Ash, Surrey, where his partner Michelle Payne called an ambulance, The Mirror reported.

In order to attack the aggressive infection, surgeons had to strip diseased flesh from Mr Sines’ leg below the knee in an emergency operation.

He then slipped into a coma for 12 days, during which time he hallucinated and had nightmares, which still haunt him.

Necrotising fasciitis is a rare bacterial infection that affects soft tissue and the tissue binding muscles and organs.

It can occur following a cut or surgery when bacteria can enter through weakened skin like a blister.

The earliest sign of the bug is people being in severe pain, which seems out of proportion to any external signs of the infection.

As it progresses, fever, diarrhoea and vomiting can occur before the person falls unconscious.

The skin typically turns a dark violet colour, blister form and the tissue underneath begins to die.

Without treatment to remove the affected tissue, the bug will spread rapidly and can result on death.

Mr Sines said: ‘My leg was being eaten alive. I was in toxic shock - my kidneys and liver were shutting down - I was dying.’

Experts are unsure how the lorry driver caught the bug, but think that his ‘diabolically weak’ immune system is to blame.

He is now having physiotherapy to help him walk again, as the lifesaving operation he underwent has left him unable to move without the aid of a frame or walking sticks.

Because of his inability to move around easily, Mr Sines gained weight rapidly, which worsened his Type 2 diabetes that he has lived with for more than 15 years.

He reached 30 stone (191kg) in May 2013 and his blood sugar levels became dangerously high.

He turned to diabetes.co.uk’s online forum for help, where others with diabetes encouraged him to take control of his life.

Mr Sines has now lost 12 stone, which has improved his diabetes. However, he has been told his prospects of walking normally again are not good.

However he is determined to return to work and has vowed to keep trying.
