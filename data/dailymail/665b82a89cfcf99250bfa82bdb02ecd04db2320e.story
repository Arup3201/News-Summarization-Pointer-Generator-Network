He failed to score in his final three games of the World Cup, but that hasn't prevented Karim Benzema leading FIFA's official player index ahead of top scorer James Rodriguez and a host of other big names.

The France striker couldn't stop his country crashing out of the tournament at the quarter-final stage as he had a last-minute effort well saved by Manuel Neuer in their 1-0 defeat by Germany at the Maracana.

But Benzema is still ahead of the rest according to the Castrol Index, which uses FIFA tracking technology to capture data on each player.

That data is then analysed by a team of performance analysts, with every pass, tackle and move on the pitch measured and assessed to see if it has a positive or negative effect when it comes to scoring and conceding.

Each player is then given a score out of 10 - with Benzema's impressive 9.79 total leaving him 0.05 ahead of Colombia hotshot Rodriguez in second.

Real Madrid forward Benzema started the tournament in impressive style, scoring twice in his country's opening 3-0 win against Honduras before netting another goal in the 5-2 demolition of Switzerland.

However his formed dipped as Didier Deschamps' side progressed to the knockout stages and he failed to score against Ecuador, Nigeria and Germany.

In contrast, Rodriguez managed to score at least once in all of Colombia's games as they eventually went down to Brazil in the last eight.

The Monaco forward finished with six goals in five appearances and was the inspiration behind Jose Pekerman's side gliding into the quarter-finals with four consecutive victories.

France defender Raphael Varane surprisingly makes up the top three with a score of 9.7, despite being at fault for Mats Hummels' winning header for Germany.

The 20-year-old is joined by fellow defenders Thiago Silva (9.66) and Hummels (9.63) in the top five, with both players having scored vital goals to help their respective sides reach the last four.

Holland's wing wizard Arjen Robben (9.59) is ranked as the sixth best player at the tournament after some dazzling displays and three goals for Louis van Gaal's side.

Another defender takes up the No 7 spot with David Luiz's stunning free-kick against Colombia helping him accumulate a score of 9.56 - 0.03 more than his team-mate and Brazil talisman Neymar.

The Barcelona forward bagged four goals on home soil before suffering a tournament-ending back injury in Friday's win against their South American rivals Colombia.

Two more defenders complete the top 10, with Holland's Stefan de Vrij (9.51) and Belgium's Jan Vertonghen (9.48) pipping a host of stars to a coveted place in the Castrol Index.

Argentina's Lionel Messi (9.41) is only ranked 13th despite helping Alejandro Sabella's side into the semi-finals with four goals, while Germany frontman Thomas Muller (9.36) is two places further back despite having netted the same amount of goals.
