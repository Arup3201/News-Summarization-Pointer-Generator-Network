Burst his bubble: Jacksonville Jaguars starting cornerback Dwayne Gratz missed practice Monday after being arrested on two misdemeanor charges in Miami

A player for the Jaguars cornerback Dwayne Gratz found himself into a sticky situation early Sunday morning as he tried to pay for items at a grocery story with chewing gum.

The second-year player didn't have any cash on him so he attempted to use bubble gum to pay for several items at a grocery store at the Ocean Reef Suites in Miami Beach, Florida.  

Refusing to take no for an answer, Gratz then began to argue with an employee at the store and then refused to leave the store.

It caused a such disturbance that caused other customers to leave the store and the police had to be called.

Officers with Miami Beach police say Gratz had bloodshot eyes and smelled of alcohol.

They him to leave the store several times but he told police: 'No. I'm not leaving.' 

Gratz was ultimately arrested just before 6 a.m. and charged with disorderly intoxication and trespassing after a warning, both misdemeanors.

He spent the following night in jail and was not released until Monday morning, missing team practice. 

More money than sense: Gratz was arrested at 5:53 a.m. Sunday after he tried to use bubble gum to purchase items from a store. He argued with an employee, refused to leave the store after police arrived, had blood-shot eyes and smelled of alcohol

Jaguars coach Gus Bradley said any discipline would be handled internally.

'He had an unfortunate situation over the weekend,' Bradley said. 

'It's not good, what took place, but it is a matter that we have to investigate even more. ... I want to talk to him and then we'll handle it within.'

Gratz, the team's third-round draft pick in 2013, has started seven games this season and has a team-high five pass breakups.
