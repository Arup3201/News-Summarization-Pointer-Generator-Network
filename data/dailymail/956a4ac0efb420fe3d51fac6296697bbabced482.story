These shocking pictures show the terrible injuries inflicted on a nurse when two muggers punched, stamped on and kicked her as she waited for a bus outside a hospital.

Lorna Hobson, 65, believed she was going to die as she was beaten on her way home from work.

As she lay screaming in agony opposite Sheffield’s Northern General Hospital the two young men  ran off – only to return to continue the attack before finally making off with her bag.

Mrs Hobson has been left so shocked that she says she will probably never work in nursing again.

‘It was obvious I was a nurse,’  said Mrs Hobson, who was left with injuries all over her body including deep bruises on her face and across her ribs.

Now: Mrs Hobson is still recovering from the attack nearly two weeks later

‘I feel angry they didn’t see my 
uniform. I was wearing a big coat with NHS written on it but that didn’t
 make any difference to these two men. They didn’t have any respect for 
me or my uniform.

‘I 
just find it so hard to comprehend and why did they have to beat me so 
badly? I am still in a lot of pain and I am still traumatised. I still 
can’t believe it happened to me.’

The health care assistant for the hospital’s evening and night service was attacked on December 28 at around 10pm after she had finished a four-hour shift.

Mrs Hobson, a married mother of three with five grandchildren  who has been in nursing for 22 years, said: ‘We’d had a lovely evening, we had cut up the Christmas cake and had a nice time. I was really happy when I left.’

She then walked from the hospital to the bus stop outside to wait for the number 87 to take her home.

‘I walked down the path to the bus stop and I stood inside the bus shelter, which is brightly lit,’ she said.

‘I noticed two youths across the road. They passed me and they must have come up behind me.‘One of them said something about the time. I remember looking at my watch and then they jumped on me and grabbed my bag. I screamed and they punched me full in the face.

Scene of the crime: Mrs Hobson was attacked by the two men as she waited at this bus stop to get home after finishing her shift at a nearby hospital

Mrs Hobson had just completed a four hour evening shift working as a health care assistant at Sheffield's Northern General Hospital

‘They dragged me out of the shelter and up a gravel path nearby. I was screaming. It was dark and I couldn’t see anything. I just remember screaming and the kicks, the punches and the stamping.’

Still scared: Mrs Hobson said it is unlikely she will return to work after the incident

Mrs Hobson said the robbers left, possibly because they had been disturbed, but then came back to continue the assault.

‘I remember lying on the ground and thinking, “They’ve gone, I’m  safe and I’m alive” – but then I saw them coming back and they started it all over again.

‘I thought it was going to be the end and they were going to kill me.’

The thugs finally stopped the  beating when they were spotted by  a woman passer-by and fled with Mrs Hobson’s shoulder bag, which had her purse containing £60  and her house keys in it, along with medical paperwork.

The passer-by helped Mrs Hobson to her feet and took her to her own casualty department.

‘After all that, it’s all a bit of a blur,’ she said. ‘I remember thinking, “I hope my patients’ notes are safe.”

‘I don’t feel I hate the people who hurt me, but for 22 years I have been a nurse and I have avoided anything happening to me.

'I doubt very much that I will be going back to work.’

The youths were described as 16 to 20, 6ft tall, skinny and dark-skinned. One was wearing grey jogging bottoms and a dark top.
