Maxi Lopez appeared to be sending a message to former team-mate Mauro Icardi and ex-wife Wanda Nara as pictures emerged of him on holiday in Miami with a new girlfriend.Â 

The couple were pictured sunbathing on Miami Beach enjoying the weather as Lopez was not selected in Argentina's World Cup squad.

The Sampdoria striker looked after Icardi, now at Inter Milan, when his fellow Argentine first moved to Italy and the pair spent lots of time together and with Lopez's then wife Nara.

However in November 2013 it emerged that Nara was leaving Lopez in order to be with Icardi, who had professed his love for her on Twitter.

By this stage Icardi had moved to Inter and his relationship with Lopez immediately deteriorated when Icardi posted photos on social media of himself with Lopez's children.

The pair were reunited on the field when Inter beat Sampdoria 4-0. They were the centre of the build-up and Lopez refused to shake Icardi's hand before the match.

Icardi responded by scoring a brace as Inter eased to victory. To make matters worse for Lopez he missed a penalty which would have allowed his team to open the scoring.
