An Alabama school is today deciding how to discipline a student who took a selfie with a dead body while on a trip to their local university's biology department.

The female high school senior faces suspension after uploading the picture to her Instagram profile.

With a beaming smile on her face, the Clements High School student, poses in front of the cadaver, as somebody out of shot lifts a sheet covering the corpse.

An Alabama high school student faces suspension after posing for a selfie with a dead body in the background. The female student posted the picture on her Instagram account

The selfie was taken on a school trip to the University of Alabama Birmingham's biology department where the students were learning about the university's anatomical donor programme.

The visit formed part of the school's programme for their anatomy students.

The teenager, who attends the school in Limestone County, used her mobile phone to take the photo of herself.

WHNT News 19 reported that the sheets covering the dead bodies, donated for the purposes of medical research, were not supposed to be removed during the visit.

Mobile phones were also banned from being used during the tour.

The teenager took the selfie on her mobile phone, while on a school trip to the University of Alabama in Birmingham, pictured. While the picture has since been deleted from Instagram, a classmate took a screenshot and showed it to her sister, who informed the school

While the photo has now been removed from the student's Instagram account, a screenshot of the selfie was taken by an anonymous classmate, who showed it to their older sister.

She then reported the incident to school officials and tipped off local media.

Karen Tucker, the Limestone County School Board Director of Public Relations and Technology, said: 'We are speaking to the University of Alabama Birmingham, they are understandably upset with this incident and we want to preserve our relationship with the university.

'Therefore we are speaking to them and wanting to know how we can mend this process and keep our relationship with them, and we are in the process of deciding on the discipline that will occur.'

Clements High School principal Keith Hairrell refused to comment on whether the female student had been suspended. His colleague Karen Tucker, director for communications, said the school is still considering the most appropriate form of punishment

School principal Keith Hairrell would not comment on whether the student has been suspended.

In a statement about the incident given to upi.com, a university spokesman, said tours of their facilities are designed to introduce high school students to the teaching and research they carry out, educating future scientist and doctors.

'Our policies require discretion and respect in our human anatomy facilities,' he said.

'No phones are allowed, no photos are to be taken, and faces of cadavers are covered. A student was made explicitly aware of these policies and breached them. This kind of disrespect is unacceptable and very disappointing. We will review our processes to ensure this does not happen again.'
