This winter has been the wettest in at least 248 years, and the fifth warmest since 1910. So perhaps it will surprise few that it will finish with snow and sleet.

This morning – the last day of winter in the forecasters’ calendar – snow and sleet is sweeping across Wales, southern England and parts of the Midlands.

As Communities Secretary Eric Pickles warned last night that the widespread flooding is set to continue for months, the Met Office confirmed that England and Wales have suffered the wettest winter since records began in 1766.

Taste of things to come: Snow returned to County Durham today but the Met Office is warning that sleep and snow will fall across England and Wales today

Having fun: Monty, a Springer Spaniel enjoying a walk after fresh snow falls in Weardale but for millions snow could cause misery with hazardous conditions on the roads

Today: Snow has fallen on northern  moorland and roads in the Pennines yesterday but the Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for today

But the same Atlantic weather systems that caused the relentless rain and floods have also created a remarkably warm winter.

Few
 parts of southern England have seen any snow, with only sporadic 
snowfalls in the north, and many areas have not had a frost since 
November.

The average temperature this winter has been a mild 5.2C 
(41F) – 1.5C above what is expected. Southern England saw 12 per cent 
more sunshine than average.

Snow has been forecast for parts of the UK today

It has marked a dramatic change from the 
previous three winters, which saw heavy blizzards throughout the UK and 
below-average temperatures.

Last year the three months of winter – 
December, January and February – averaged 3.3C (38F).

With the exception
 of 2011-12, which averaged 4.6C (40F), every other winter since 2007-08
 has been colder than average.

Mr Pickles said last night: ‘Further 
groundwater flooding is unfortunately expected over the coming days in 
the South and South East, and may be an issue for some months to come. 

‘Local resilience forums continue to assess the risk to property.’

Forecasters
 yesterday issued a yellow warning for snow, urging people to take care 
of hazardous conditions on the roads, but said the snow was unlikely to 
settle below high ground.

Met Office spokesman Dan Williams said: 
‘Areas in the South East and West as well as the south-west Midlands may
 see some slushy snow. Towards Bristol and Wales is also similar. We 
were expecting more but we’ve revised our predictions.

‘The yellow 
warning is in place from 2am till 3pm on Friday. It’s likely to be 
slushy snow – we doubt it will settle. We’re not expecting it to be too 
widespread.

‘Temperatures are cooler than they have been earlier this month but this isn’t out of the ordinary.’

Records
 dating back to 1766 – the oldest weather data set in the world – show 
that December, January and February have been the wettest ever recorded 
in England and Wales.

The weather series, which is compiled by the 
Oxford Radcliffe Observatory on behalf of the Met Office, started 
recording data from 50 weather stations in the 18th century. 

Today the information comes from thousands of hi-tech stations, which feed powerful computers.

The
 information shows 17.1in (435mm) of rain fell between December 1 and 
February 24 this year, beating the previous highest total of 16.6in 
(423mm) in 1915.

Paul Mott from weather forecasters MeteoGroup, said snow was likely on high ground over 300 metres.

He said: 'Through this morning there will be some snow likely over the hills of Wales and maybe over some western parts of the Midlands, Shropshire, Herefordshire and Worcestershire.

'It will mostly be confined to the hills, which could have a covering of between 1cm and 3cm (0.4in to 1.2in), and will continue through up until 9am or 10am, when it will die away.'
