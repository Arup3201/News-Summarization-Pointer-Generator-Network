An Australian man whose young twin children were conceived through a surrogate mother in Thailand has been charged with 10 counts of sexually abusing his children.

The man, aged in his 50s, has also been charged with the possession of 53 child pornography images.

He was revealed to have been separated from his wife, who became the children's sole carer despite having no biological connection to them, when the sexual abuse occurred.

The children were born via a surrogate mother named Siriwan Nitichad and known as Aon from the Petchabun province, who claims she was paid $5,500 for her role in the birth

Police told Channel Nine's A Current Affair that the man 'seemed not to cope with fatherhood' once he'd returned to Australia after his children's birth.

Court documents describe the man as having a vicious temper according to the ABC, and becoming unemployed before the marriage came to an end.

However his ex-wife was forced to ask the man to take care of their children, who were aged either four or five at the time, while she was in hospital.

During this time, he allegedly encouraged one of his children to touch him inappropriately as the other looked on.

The children were offered stickers and lollies and threatened that if they did not follow his commands, they would be hit. 

Aon was 23-years-old at the time and provided her own egg before carrying the twins, as the man and his former wife struggled to conceive on their own and did not qualify for adoption.

Mrs Nitichad was made aware of the allegations against the biological father in June 2013 and told the ABC 'I felt terrible, I felt very bad, I don't know how to describe it'

They were born via a surrogate mother named Siriwan Nitichad and known as Aon from the Petchabun province, who claims she was paid $5,500 for her role in the birth, according to the ABC.

Aon was 23-years-old at the time and provided her own egg before carrying the twins, as the man and his former wife struggled to conceive on their own and did not qualify for adoption.

She told the ABC that when the couple had come to Thailand to meet her, they begged her to be their surrogate.

'She said her husband wanted to have a baby so much, please help them, please help them,' Aon said of the man's wife.

As the twin's biological mother, Mrs Nitichad said she and her husband  would be happy to take them back into their care

The man, who has denied all of the allegations, is out on bail but will face court in December

The now 30-year-old woman described the twins as 'lovely' and admitted that she 'didn't want to let them go' after giving birth, claiming she would have given the couple their money back and kept the children herself if they had allowed it.

She was made aware of the allegations against the biological father in June 2013 and told the ABC 'I felt terrible, I felt very bad, I don't know how to describe it'.

Although Australian child welfare authorities are looking into the option of securing the children long-term care with their biological mother in Thailand, the situation has been recognised as complicated due to the children having no knowledge of their Thai background. 

Aon and her husband told the ABC that they would be happy to take the twins into their care. 

The man, who has denied all of the allegations, is out on bail but will face court in December. 

Surrogacy arrangements in Thailand have come under scrutiny recently because of the case of baby Gammy, a surrogate-born boy with Down syndrome whose Australian parents left him behind.

The Thai government is considering new legislation to ban the practice.

Thailand and Australia are working out a transition process for an expected 150 Australian couples and Thai surrogate mothers expected to give birth over the next year.
