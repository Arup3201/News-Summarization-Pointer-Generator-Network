An 18-year-old Marine has mysteriously died during his first day of training at Camp Pendleton while performing a treading water exercise in a test pool.

An investigation has been launched into the death of Pfc. Joshua Islam, who is believed to have drowned on Monday afternoon while undergoing an initial screening test for an infantry school that involves treading water for 30 minutes at the school's base in San Diego, California.

The test is the first part of the Marines Awaiting Reconnaissance Training, School of Infantry-West, is a precursor to the Marines' physically demanding reconnaissance training. Those who pass the series of tests can begin training for the Corps elite reconnaissance units.

Officials declined to release details about the cause of death pending the outcome of the investigation.

It also remains unclear at which point in the 30 minute test Islam died.

A spokesman for Camp Pendleton, Col. Sean Gibson, said the 'safety standards are extremely high' at Camp Pendleton and that 'incredible care is taken by those in the pool'.

Islam, from Weddington, North Carolina, was a rifleman from Union County.

He had only graduated from boot camp at Perris Island three months ago and finished at Weddington High School last year, where he was a star baseball player.

His coach, Travis Poole, remembers Islam as a resilient, loyal, passionate and quiet young man, according to 10News.com.

Poole coached Islam for four years and said the young man was always the player with the most heart.

'He wasn't going to do anything mediocre,' Poole said.

'He was going to do it the best he could possibly do it. That's a lesson that all the kids need to learn.'

The cause of death is unknown but it's not thought to be related to drowning

Islam helped the team win two state championships during his last
 years in high school. Poole said with that kind of dedication, he 
wasn't surprised that Islam wanted to be a Marine.

'We talked and he was excited,' Poole said.

'He
 was ready to move on to his next chapter. He graduated boot camp and 
now his next chapter was, as he would say, to be the best of the best.'

Brig. Gen. John Simmons offered his condolences to Islam's family.

Friends of Joshua have been using twitter to share memories of their deceased friend under #JoshIslam.

'Kid
 graduated high school last year. Really shows that you have to make 
every minute count. #ripjoshislam,' said Dillon Dunn â€
