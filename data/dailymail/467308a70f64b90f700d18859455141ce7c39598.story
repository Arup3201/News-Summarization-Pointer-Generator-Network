The number of female drinkers suffering from liver disease has soared in the last ten years. 

Older women and teenage girls are particularly vulnerable, according to new data from the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC).

Treatment for women aged under 30 has increased by an incredible 58 per cent since 2004.

The youngest girl hospitalised with the disease was a 19-year-old from Cambridgeshire.

Alcohol-related liver disease refers to liver damage caused by alcohol misuse and binge-drinking. 

It has increased rapidly over the years and is now the third main cause of premature death.  

The disease can lead up to a build-up of fats in the liver.

Symptoms include feeling sick, weight loss, yellowing  eyes and thickening ankles. 

If untreated it can progress to alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis, which can be fatal. 

There is no set cure and those suffering from the disease are advised to stop drinking for the rest of their lives. 

Women are thought to be more vulnerable due to their body size. 

Current guidelines suggest they should not drink more than 28 units a week. 

Last year 5,214 females aged over 30 were also diagnosed with alcoholic liver disease - up from 4,210 in 2004.

Women are thought to be more susceptible due to body size.  

Experts are blaming binge-drinking for the rise in the condition. 

Recent  figures show that teenagers are consuming twice as much alcohol  - 10.4 units a week compared to 5.3 units a decade ago. 

Andrew Langford, chief executive of the British Liver Trust, said that liver disease in the UK was 'spiralling out of control'. 

He said: 'Unfortunately the increasing amounts and regularity in which women are drinking are causing these shocking increases in alcohol related liver disease.  

'Many women are now drinking most days, whether that is a few drinks after work or opening a bottle of wine when the kids have gone to bed, and this is leading to drinking too much on a regular basis. 

'Liver disease is now the third main cause of premature death. The government and the alcohol industry must make it a lot clearer what is a safe amount to drink. 

'They must also very importantly encourage anyone who drinks to take at least two or three consecutive days off every week.

'We encourage everyone to complete the liver health screener to assess what risk they maybe at, get clear advice on what to do and if necessary what to discuss with their GP.' 

Kingsley Manning, chair of HSCIC, said: 'This paints a powerful picture of the many impacts that alcohol has on patients and the NHS in this country.'
