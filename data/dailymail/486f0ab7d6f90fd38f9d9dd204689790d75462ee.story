A driver punched a pensioner unconscious, leaving him with a broken jaw, after the 71-year-old gestured at him to slow down in a quiet suburban street.

Peter Stringer was taking his mother-in-law's dog for a walk on Sunday evening when he was brutally attacked near a golf course in Walkden, Greater Manchester.

Police said a black Mercedes Saloon car came screeching to a halt after he gestured for it to slow down, before reversing back towards him.

Shaken: Peter Stringer, 71, was attacked while walking his mother-in-law's dog in a quiet suburban street

The driver then jumped out of the car and punched the pensioner hard in the face, fracturing his jaw and leaving him unconscious.

He was left lying on the ground as the thug then drove away from the scene.

Only later was he discovered and taken to hospital.

Officers are appealing for anyone with information on the attack, which happened at around 7.30pm, to contact police.

The offender is described as an Asian male, around 30 years old and between 5ft 8ins and 5ft 9ins tall.

He has a sallow complexion, short, black hair and a short, trimmed beard and wore smart casual clothing.

Scene: The assault happened at this junction in Walkden, Greater Manchester. Police appealed for witnesses

Detective Constable Paul Davies from Greater Manchester Police said: 'The victim has been left understandably shaken by this unprovoked assault.

'I believe the injuries would have been more severe had the victim not fallen onto a grass verge.

'The offender has thought nothing of fleeing the scene and did not even call an ambulance.

'Unfortunately no witnesses to this assault have come forward and the victim came too on the grass verge alone, with no one around to check on his welfare.

'It was a cowardly act and I ask for anybody with information about this incident or think they may have seen a vehicle matching that description driving erratically in the area at the time to contact Police.'
