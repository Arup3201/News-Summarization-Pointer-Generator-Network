The Prime Minister's Chief of Staff, Peter Credlin has been dragged into the Independent Commission Against Corruption inquiry into property developer donations and the Liberal Party.

The emails show just how much access a Liberal donor had to powerful figures within the party.

ICAC commissioner Megan Latham lifted a suppression order today on the email trail today.

Ms Latham ruled there was no reason why emails from March 2011 between big party donor Brickworks, the then chief Liberal party fundraiser Paul Nicolaou and Ms Credlin could not be made public.

Mr Partridge began by making a supportive statement to Mr Nicolaou in relation to Tony Abbott's push against the carbon tax 'Paul, tell Tony to stick to his guns on no carbon tax'.

'I am running an internal fight with the BCA (Business Council of Australia) who seem to be driven by a few companies who will make bundles out of the tax.

'We want certainty that there is no new tax,' Mr Partridge's email stated.

Brickworks reportedly provided donations of up to $384,000 to the Liberal Party from July 2010 to April 2011.

ICAC heard how Mr Nicolaou sent the email on to Ms Credlin stating 'please note below from Lindsay Partridge the MD of Brickworks the largest producers of bricks in Australia and a very good supporter of the party'.

Her reply read the information 'provides a great line for Question Time'.

The email trail continued with Ms Credlin asking: 'Do you have a number that I might be able to contact him on and see if he was happy for us to use it and perhaps, use his sector as an example (if not his actual business)? We wouldn’t do this without his explicit approval but it would be ideal for tomorrow'. 

'We want certainty that there is no new tax,' so said the email from Brickworks boss Lindsay Partridge

ICAC also heard that Mr Nicolaou had invited Mr Partridge to a private dinner with Tony Abbott and other business leaders at a cost of $5000 a head. The event was ultimately cancelled.

As the donations from Brickworks arrived, Mr Nicolaou reportedly shared the news with Brian Loughnane, the federal director of the Liberal Party. Mr Loughnane is married to Peta Credlin (above), the PM's chief of staff.

The email trail between the PM's Chief of Staff and the Liberal Party's senior fundraiser continued with Ms Credlin asking: 'Do you have a number that I might be able to contact him on and see if he was happy for us to use it and perhaps, use his sector as an example (if not his actual business)? We wouldn’t do this without his explicit approval but it would be ideal for tomorrow'.

Mr Partridge returned with: 'In Australia most building and construction materials are made locally due to the weight; they (are) expensive to import. Under a carbon tax regime many products including cement production will move offshore'.

'Under a carbon tax regime many products including cement production will move offshore. The others the price will just go up by the tax.'

A short time after this communication between the three, then Opposition Leader Tony Abbott visited the Austral Bricks site at Horsley Park in Sydney's outer south-west and remarked that the carbon tax would push up the price of bricks to the tune of 10 per cent and that consumers would wear the increase.

Brickworks Limited is the parent company of Austral Bricks, with investment in building product groups such as Austral Bricks and with significant interests in property sales and waste management.

Mr Partridge earlier told the ICAC he regularly donated through the Free Enterprise Foundation because it was more 'discreet' than handing money straight to the Liberal party.

'It kept it out of the press's eyes until after the official declaration was done, which was usually after the election,' he said.

The ICAC is investigating allegations the Free Enterprise Foundation was used to disguise back-door donations to the New South Wales Liberal Party in the lead-up to the 2011 election.

It's alleged that donors who wanted to contribute to the NSW party - but were prevented under 2009 laws that prohibited property developers - would give to the foundation instead.

An email Mr Partridge sent in July 29, 2010 to Mr Nicolaou makes direct reference to a $50,000 donation.

The emails had originally been suppressed over claims of a possible breach of parliamentary privilege but that order was lifted today.

ICAC also heard that Mr Nicolaou had invited Mr Partridge to a private dinner with Tony Abbott and other business leaders at a cost of $5000 a head. The event was ultimately cancelled.

As the donations from Brickworks arrived, Mr Nicolaou reportedly shared the news with Brian Loughnane, the federal director of the Liberal Party. Mr Loughnane is married to Peta Credlin.

The current ICAC inquiry is looking at whether prohibited donations were solicited by Liberal members, including former cabinet ministers Chris Hartcher and Mike Gallacher, ahead of the 2011 state election.
