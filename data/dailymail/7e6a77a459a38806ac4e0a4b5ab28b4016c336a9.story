Karen Danczuk, 31, has gained thousands of followers by posting selfies on her Twitter profile

An MP’s wife who gained thousands of Twitter followers after posting a number of selfies showing off her cleavage has taken to social media once again to reveal before-and-after bikini shots.

Karen Danczuk, 31, who is married to Rochdale Labour MP Simon Danczuk, 47, has uploaded two photos of her posing in swimwear for her 6,000 followers.

In one shot, the mother-of-two can be seen leaning over the poolside in a blue bikini while another shows her smiling to the camera in a one-piece.

The social media lover has posted dozens of photographs in recent months, mostly of her cleavage, and about 40 images alone since the beginning of July.

She accompanied the latest photo of herself in a bikini with the caption: ‘#throwbackthursday - enjoyed my mini break to Spain! Beautiful country, beautiful weather! KD’.

It was followed up a day later with a more recent photograph of herself in a swimming costume, with the message: ‘Absolutely love this swimming costume!!! It’s a little quirky an extravagant but I love it!!!!’ 

It is not the first time that Mrs Danczuk, a councillor in Rochdale, has attracted national attention by posting images of herself online.

She hit headlines earlier this year with her ‘saucy’ Twitter selfies, which she came out and defended after receiving criticism for trying to gain popularity.

At the time, Mrs Danczuk – who also owns a deli in Rochdale with her husband – said the photos ‘weren't supposed to be sexy’.

She said: ‘I’m not an attention seeker. I don’t roll out of clubs drunk. I’m not silly. I’m not a crazy party animal. I’m not a girly girl and I rarely wear make-up. In fact, I’m quite a tomboy.

‘Not all my tops are low-necked. I don’t wear short dresses — all my dresses are knee-length. Gosh, I’ve seen more flesh in the supermarket than I have in my photos.’

She also claimed her husband was proud of her newfound attention, something which he reiterated by reposting her online tweets with the caption: ‘‘Proud of my wife — brains and beauty!’

The pair married in 2012 and have two sons together, Milton, six, and Maurice, four.

The
 cleavage-exposing photographs taken by the Rochdale councillor became the talk of Westminster earlier this year, including these pictures of the dress she wore to mark the 
70th anniversary of the D-Day landings
