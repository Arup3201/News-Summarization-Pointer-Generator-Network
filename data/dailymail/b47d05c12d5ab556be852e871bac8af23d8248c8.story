A paramedic who wrote abusive comments on Facebook about an NHS campaigner, whose mother who died at Stafford Hospital, has been suspended.

Roy Guest, 51, was told he could not work for a year after posting ‘offensive’ remarks about whistle-blower Julie Bailey's late mother, Bella, who died while being cared for at the scandal-hit institution.

One of the many comments he posted on the social media page stated: ‘I hope you suffer a life threatening illness...’

Ms Bailey set up the campaign group Cure the NHS and has been widely credited for pushing politicians to hold
 a public inquiry into the failings.

The Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) panel ruled that Guest should be suspended from the register for 12 months.

Panel chair Clair Bonnet said: ‘The panel concluded that his insight is limited. The registrant has not engaged with these proceedings at any stage.

‘Whilst he sought to apologise to JB 
in writing, the panel considered that his draft letter was, to a 
significant degree, self-centred.

‘It focused more on the impact of his actions upon himself and his family,
 rather than on the impact upon JB or upon the reputations of the 
profession and/or the trust.

‘The
 panel had no evidence before it of the registrant’s current attitude or
 whether he had taken any steps to remediate his misconduct.

Ms
 Bailey, who has since been awarded a CBE, has had problems with trolls in the past, receiving abuse from Twitter users.

Comments by the paramedic, who was sacked by West Midlands Ambulance Trust last year, included: 'I hope you get a life-threatening illness'

Ms Bailey has been credited with bringing the crisis at the hospital to light and pushing politicians to act

Probes
 into the scandal at Stafford revealed that poor care could have led to the deaths 
of hundreds of patients as a result of maltreatment and neglect.

Many 
were left lying in their own urine and excrement for days, forced to 
drink water from vases or given the wrong medication.

Her campaign eventually led to a full public inquiry into the scandal which in turn has led to wider NHS reforms.

 A spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service said: 'West Midlands Ambulance Service is aware of the hearing held by the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC).

The Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) panel said Guest had not engaged in any of the proceedings involved with the investigation

'The HCPC hearing refers to comments made on a Facebook open forum by a former member of staff.

'The incident was taken extremely seriously by the Trust when the posting first became public in February 2013. An investigation was instigated by the Trust and the member of staff concerned was dismissed in May 2013. 

'It goes without saying that the Trust would not condone a personal attack and wishes to distance itself from the published comments making reference to Julie Bailey and the situation at Mid-Staffordshire Hospital.

Last year, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said cruelty in the NHS became had widespread during the scandal

The hospital was the subject of a 2009 inquiry which found as many as 1,200 people may have needlessly died due to poor care over four years.

The scandal came to national attention because of an investigation by the Healthcare Commission into it's day-to-day running.

The commission was first alerted by the 'apparently high mortality rates in patients admitted as emergencies'.

When the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust failed to provide what the commission considered an adequate explanation, a full-scale investigation was carried out in 2008.

The published report severely criticised the Foundation Trust's management and detailed the appalling conditions and inadequacies at the hospital.

Last year Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said cruelty was allowed to become 'normal' in the NHS at the time of the Stafford hospital scandal and neither staff nor ministers took any notice.
