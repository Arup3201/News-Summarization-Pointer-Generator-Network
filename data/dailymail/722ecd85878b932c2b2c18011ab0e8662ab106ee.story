Lawsuit: Paugh William Shadow is suing the NYC Department of Education for alleged racial discrimination at his Bronx school

A white school teacher and part-time actor is suing the New York City Department of Education because he claims he suffered racial discrimination at his predominantly black and Latino middle school.

Paugh William Shadow, or Dr. Shadow as he is known, filed a lawsuit at the Manhattan Supreme Court against the city for his alleged treatment at the Angelo Patri Middle School in the Bronx.

Dr. Shadow, 42, claims he was falsely accused of beating the pupils, using crude language, not arriving for work and says he was not allowed a key to use the restroom for three years.

In his court filing, Dr. Shadow cites the failure of school administrators to support him in disciplinary matters and their refusal to pay him back for science-lab apparatus he bought out of his own pocket.

Dr. Shadow is also accused of making sixth-graders walk up and down stairs as a form of punishment and alleges that he was 'humiliated' in front of his colleagues 'due to his gender and race'.

According to his deleted school profile, Dr. Shadow taught 7th grade mathematics and also science.

His bio states that he 'has taught overseas as well as in NYC. Besides science, Dr. Shadow has a passion for acting and has been on TV shows, commercials, movies and video games.'

Film roles: Dr. Shadow has appeared in The Good Wife and auditioned for roles in the HBO series The Leftovers

Listing himself as 6-foot 6-inches on his IMDB profile, Dr. Shadow claims his acting career began at the age of seven.

Working as a local DJ, Dr. Shadow says that he has traveled the world and on his return began work as a teacher and has begun his own online talk show, The Shadow Show.
