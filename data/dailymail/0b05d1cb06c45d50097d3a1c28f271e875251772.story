Britain's broken society is slowly on the mend, with a quarter of a million more children living with both parents than when the Government came to power, Iain Duncan Smith said today.

The Work and Pensions Secretary, who oversees all Government policy on social justice, said there were other ‘signs of hope’, including 160,000 people having taken up an offer of support to keep troubled families together.

In a major speech in London, Mr Duncan Smith said he believed a ‘revolution is underway’ in some of Britain’s ‘poorest neighbourhoods’.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said 250,000 more children were living with both parents than in 2010

There are record numbers of people in work, up two million since 2010, 33,000 pupils on free school meals are now getting good grades in English and Maths GCSE and members of 53,000 troubled families are back to school or into work, he said.

Official figures also suggest 2,100 former gang members are ‘back on the straight and narrow’.

The latest figures show economic inactivity is at a historic low, and more than 800,000 fewer people are on the main out-of-work benefits. There has also been the largest ever annual fall both in youth unemployment and workless households.

‘Each and every one of these statistics is a rise in hope. Each and every one, a life transformed,’ Mr Duncan Smith said.

He claimed that the Government had been ‘unwavering in its commitment to social reform’, saying changes to welfare, education, justice and health were all designed ‘so that they no longer trap people, but set them on a path from dependency to independence’.

‘Social justice is about offering meaningful routes out of disadvantage, and dispelling the appalling idea that it is easier to manage the problem than to help transform people’s lives.

‘For you don’t solve addiction by parking people on methadone. You don’t stop problem debt by abandoning people to payday lenders.

‘You don’t rehabilitate offenders by simply locking them away, and you don't cure welfare dependency by parking people on benefits.’

The decline of the traditional family, pictured in the 1950s, had damaged the prospects of the poor, Iain Duncan Smith has said

Previous governments had thrown ‘more and more taxpayers’ money on ineffective remedial policies, in the hope of doing something’ about the country’s social ills, he said.

The coalition had pioneered a new approached, investing in programmes based on results and which involved ‘intervening early’ and ‘offering second chances out where lives do go off track’.

‘It has not been easy, for cultural change is never quick. Yet I believe we are now seeing real progress,’ Mr Duncan Smith said.

‘It starts with prevention: getting to the source of social problems early, rather than waiting to pick up the pieces.’

He pointed to schemes in health, where new family nurse partnerships are now helping vulnerable mothers in over 100 councils, and the record number of parents – more than a million – now using children’s centres.

Some 260,000 disadvantaged two-year-olds are now benefiting from free early education, he added.

Despite the progress, he warned that the ‘disparity between the top and bottom of society is in many cases larger than it has ever been’.

‘We have a group of skilled professionals and wealth creators at the top of society who have little or no connection to those at the bottom.

‘Yet in so many cases what divides the two is little more than a different start in life.

‘I believe social investment gives us an opportunity to lock not just wealth back into our most disadvantaged areas – but something else as well.’

Mr Duncan Smith urged the wealthy and big firms to put money into ‘social enterprises’ in deprived neighbourhoods.
