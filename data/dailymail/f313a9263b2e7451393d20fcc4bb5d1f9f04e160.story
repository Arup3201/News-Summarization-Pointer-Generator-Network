Royalty is back Down Under, but this visit is likely to be much more subdued than the hype which surrounded the last royal visit.

Princess Anne arrived in Brisbane on Tuesday morning ahead of an international agricultural conference, amid excitement about another royal baby.

The Princess Royal will attend the 26th Royal Agricultural Society of the Commonwealth (RASC) at the Royal National Agricultural and Industrial Association of Queensland (RNA).

Kate is also due to make her first public appearance on Tuesday, British time, since it was revealed in early September she was pregnant. 

The 32-year-old has been out of the spotlight as she's battled severe morning sickness.

The RASC was founded in 1957 by The Duke of Edinburgh Prince Phillip, and he was President of the society for half a century. Princess Anne then took over the role.

'I think Princess Anne has always been a popular royal, she's very hard-working,' he told the publication. 

'I think she's one of those people who are very approachable; my dealings with her have been completely delightful.'

Dozens of nations including the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Kenya, Uganda, Canada, India and Jamaica will have representatives at the conference.

At least 230 delegates from these partnering countries will attend, in addition to representatives from interstate and local show societies.
