A few years ago travellers were happy if their luggage could withstand being battered by baggage handlers while being light enough not to risk massive charges.

But a new generation of consumers is demanding luggage that is not only portable and durable, but tell you if it gets lost, and designers are happy to oblige.

Bags with GPS trackers, smart phone locking systems and ports for charging mobile phones are among some of the innovative designs available in time for the summer holiday season.

Proximity sensors lock the suitcase when they detect you have walked away, or it can also be locked manually through the app (shown). GPS tells you where your bag is if it gets re-routed to another flight, and a built-in battery can charge your smartphone six times over

Trunkster features an innovative sliding door as well as GPS trackers and a battery charger

Coming in August is Trunkster, which offers both carry on and check in options. Funded by a Kickstarter campaign, it was created by Gaston Blanchet and Jesse Potash, from New York, They set about creating their ultimate suitcase after tiring of 'brittle zippers, cumbersome flaps, flimsy handles, and unreliable wheels' on traditional luggage.

They came up with the 'game-changing' design for the sliding door on the luggage which opens at the touch of a button.

'We're all too familiar with that frustrating moment when you realise you quickly need something out of your bag,' The Trunkster team writes on their Kickstarter page.

'With Trunkster’s revolutionary sliding door, you no longer have to unzip your entire bag and flap it open. The rolltop door lets you instantly access your belongings in one swift motion.' 

For passengers who are less keen on getting their hands on the latest gadgets and more interested in having enough room for cheeky holiday purchases there is the Fugu.

For £399, users can also have a removable battery pack that can charge a device up to nine times, a built-in GPS and a built-in digital scale in the handle.

A few months later in October the first deliveries of carry-on suitcase Bluesmart will be shipped out. 

Designed by a team from New York and funded by an Indiegogo campaign, the bag is connected by Bluetooth to the user's smartphone. Via an app, the owner can lock and unlock it and work out how much it weights. 

Sensors in the suitcase automatically detect  if the owner has walked away and lock it or notify the user if it is being left behind. 

The suitcase, which is available for £120 for early backers on Indiegogo will be shipped out by August.

'We came up with the idea for Bluesmart after suffering a couple of bad experiences with our luggage, when airlines forced us to check bags only to have them mishandled or lost,' said Tomi Pierucci, co-founder of Bluesmart.

'We realised that with all the amazing technology available today, we could do better.

'Suitcases haven’t seen much innovation in decades, so we decided to design a suitcase for this century.'

 On this side of the pond, French designer Delsey is working on a prototype smart suitcase called Pluggage. 

A check lock facility that can tell the Pluggage user if the suitcase has been opened by someone else, an app weather forecast  and an inside speaker are some of the other options being looked at

Not only will the bag contain a battery charger, and scales inside the handle, it will tell owner when it is safely stored in the aeroplane's hold and double up as a sound system with internal speakers. 

People around the world are now being asked to vote whether they want any other features to be included in the finished product.

'Pluggage will allow ultraconnected travellers to make their lives more simple', Delsey's director of design Albert Engler said. 

The Pluggage line of three smart bags will be released in the first half of 2016, with a possible price of £399 for a 24-inch model.

 For travellers on a budget who like the sound of being able to track their bag but are put off by the hefty price tag, Trakdot is offering a GPS system that can be used with existing luggage.

Billed as the 'first affordable luggage tracking device', for £79 and an annual fee, users are sent a message saying their suitcase has safely landed - or letting you know if it has ended up in Rome instead of Riga. 

A new digital lock will hit the markets soon, allowing tourists to lock and unlock their suitcase with a swipe of their iPhone.

The designers of the eGeeTouch lock, from US company Digipas, claim to offer a hassle-free alternative to normal locks and keys, offering increased security because it needs a specific smartphone or tablet to use it

The lock is battery operated which will last for three years, but it can also be charged via USB, and uses NFC (Near Field Communications) to operate; a feature that is compatible with most smartphones.

For passengers who are less keen on getting their hands on the latest gadgets and more interested in having enough room for cheeky holiday purchases there is the Fugu. 

Created by a team of Israeli designers, it triples its volume from 40 litres to 120 litres.

The expandable suitcase, which doubles as a closet and laptop table, can then be checked into the hold. 

Isaac Atlas, industrial designer at Fugu, got the idea for the case when he had to buy new luggage on his way home from a trip because his carry-on bag could not fit in all his extra shopping.

On their Kickstarter page they write: 'Today's advanced technology makes nearly every aspect of day-to-day life simpler and easier. Despite these advances, there is one heavily used product that has not significantly progressed in decades: the suitcase

'Having decided that the time has come to rethink the traditional suitcase, we have developed Fugu Luggage – an innovative lifestyle product that adjusts to meet the needs of the modern traveller.'

It will be released by the end of the year.  

 Chairman of the British Travelgoods and Acessories Association Jacquie Sandison said the industry was worth £1.63billion to the UK economy and she believed there would be a strong market for smart luggage in the UK. 

She added: 'The industry is buoyant and consumers are always keen to source new and exciting travel brands that keep pace with trends, lifestyles and now technology. Manufacturers are innovative these days and invest heavily in research, development and design. It was inevitable that a company would produce products like these eventually. As Smartphone ownership in the UK continues to increase I believe there is real growth potential here for Smartphone compatible luggage, not everyone wants a black suitcase with a red ribbon tied to the handle.'
