Even after 30 years in the industry, Madonna is still in hot demand.

Indeed, Versace has snapped up the 56-year-old to be the face of its SS15 campaign. 

The iconic pop star replaces Lady Gaga, 28, to front the brand and was chosen because designer Donatella Versace believes she is a 'true icon'.

The images, which were photographed in New York City by industry heavyweights Mert Alas & Marcus Piggott, aim to focus on Madonna’s 'unique and iconic image'.

The campaign was shot to capture the unapologetic and timeless power of Madonna today, according to the luxury fashion house.

Of course, Madonna is dressed head-to-toe in pieces from the SS15 Versace collection and showcases her toned body in the imagery.

Speaking about her new role, Madonna said: 'It’s always exciting to be dressed head-to-toe in Versace and experience first-hand Donatella’s vivid imagination and passion that she has created for this collection.

This is the fourth time that Madonna has appeared in Versace's advertising campaigns; her first in 1995

Designer Donatella added: 'Madonna is one of the true icons of Versace. I am thrilled to have my friend and the most powerful and directional artist as the face of Versace for Spring 2015.'

This is the fourth time that Madonna has appeared in Versace’s advertising campaigns; her first was back in 1995.

The singer has been causing quite a stir this week after posing topless in a cut-out corset for a magazine shoot.

The Interview cover shoot shows the mother-of-four at her raunchiest  as she models a series of cut-away outfits while reclining on a bed. 

The shoot caused an uproar on social media with many users insinuating that her breasts appeared too plastic.
