A dopey burglar who ransacked a couple’s home while they were on holiday has landed himself in jail after accidentally sending a selfie of himself to the victim’s colleagues.

Ashley Keast, 25, snapped the picture of himself in a white sleeveless vest using a stolen SIM card which he swiped while burgling the property.

Keast, of Norfolk Court, Rotherham, put the stolen SIM card into another phone, took the boasting
selfie and posted it on the ‘WhatsApp’ messenger application.

Ashley Keast, pictured, who burgled a property in Brinsworth, Rotherham, with sidekick Anthony Hunt, accidentally sent this selfie to one of the victim's work colleagues after the raid

However, in doing so, the picture was 
also sent to all the contacts stored on the stolen SIM, meaning friends 
and work colleagues of the victim received the photo.

 Keast and his sidekick Anthony Hunt burgled the couple’s home in 
Brinsworth, Rotherham, on September 11 last year and stole £27,000 worth
 of goods including a 4,000 Rolex watch, an Audi A4, electrical items 
and sentimental jewellery.

On the night of the offence, Keast and Hunt, 27, had borrowed a friend’s car to go and buy cigarettes but instead broke into the house via a rear patio door.

The stolen Audi A4 was found crashed in Rotherham town centre a short time after the raid.

The pair were caught after the victim's work colleagues became suspicious after receiving the selfie and alerted police, who arrested the duo the following day.

Officers found the stolen Rolex watch wrapped in a towel behind a radiator at Keast’s town centre flat and later returned it to the victim.

Keast was jailed for two years and 
eight months on Tuesday after he admitted burglary at Sheffield Crown 
Court. He also admitted being in breach of a suspended sentence.

Hunt, of Garbroads Crescent, Rotherham, was jailed for 18 months after he also admitted the offence.

A
 spokeswoman for South Yorkshire Police said ‘Keast had stolen a SIM 
card from the property and, using another phone, took a selfie and 
posted it on the whatsapp messenger application.

Keast was jailed for two years and eight months after he admitted burglary at Sheffield Crown Court, pictured. Hunt was jailed for 18 months after he also admitted the offence

‘However, unknowingly, Keast also sent the picture to the victim’s work colleagues, who became suspicious and contacted police.’

PC Adam Broughton, of South Yorkshire Police, said after the sentencing: ‘Burglaries cause victims a great deal of pain and suffering and in this case many items of sentimental value can never be replaced.

‘The result of this case should act as a deterrent to would be offenders who should think twice about committing such offences.’
