This map shows how Europe would look if every separatist movement was granted its dream of independence.

With the Scottish referendum just days away, the issue of regions breaking away from their traditional rulers is looming large over the continent.

The map features well-known separatist movements, such as the powerful and vocal Basque Nationalist movement in northern Spain and southwestern France, as well as the more obscure, such as the Savoyan League, which supports the independence of the Savoy region of France, which has a population of around 405,500.

The map has been put together by the European Free Alliance, to which '40 progressive nationalist, regionalist and autonomous parties throughout the European Union' belong.

The map shows Germany split from Bavaria, which has a population of 12.5million. Bavarian nationalism has been a strong phenomenon since the incorporation of Bavaria into the state of Germany in 1871.

Venetian nationalism is a regionalist movement promoting the re-discovery of the Republic of Venice's heritage, traditions, culture and language.

The Venetian Republic existed for 1100 years from 697 to 1797 and was the one of the first modern republics of the world.

The issue of independence was largely dormant until the 1970s and 1980s, when frustration with taxes, bureaucracy, and the inefficiency of the Italian government spilled over.

Separatism movements claim that local wealth is siphoned off for the benefit of a corrupt and incompetent political ruling class in capitals like Madrid and Rome. The argument has been fuelled in recent years by high unemployment and economic turmoil.

Closer to home we see the nation of Cornwall on the map. Some Cornish residents say the county has a distinct identity and should be a nation state with the same rights and political autonomy as Scotland and Wales.

According to a recent survey on Basque nationalism, 59 per cent of Basques want a referendum on independence, a five per cent rise in just one year.

Gianluca Busato, leader of the Veneto separatists, recently said: 'The right of self-determination that is triumphing in Venice is the only way to free ourselves from the worst bureaucratic monster of the western world – the bloodthirsty beast of the Italian state.'

Scottish independence would be a 'torpedo' to the foundations of Europe and wreak economic recessions across the continent, Spain's prime minister has warned.

Mariano Rajoy has been trying to quell calls in the northern Spanish region of Catalonia for a similar vote on breaking away, with his government denouncing such a move as illegal. He also confirmed that Scotland would have to reapply to the EU as a separate member state should it gain independence.

With the regional government in Barcelona - which has pencilled in a consultation on independence on November 9 - set to potentially give such a vote a green light on Friday, the spotlight could turn to Catalonia's drive to cut ties with Spain once Scotland votes. Last Thursday, thousands of Catalans descended on Barcelona calling for their right to vote.

Responding in parliament when asked if his government would help facilitate Scotland's integration into the EU if it voted 'Yes', Mr Rajoy said: 'The whole of Europe believes these processes are enormously negative.'

'They create big problems in areas such as currency, public debt, pension payments... they produce recessions and poverty for all,' he said. 'These processes are a torpedo below the waterline of the European spirit.'
