Rachel Lyne, who was a victim of a harassment campaign by Richard and Amanda Holman, who claimed she was a prostitute

Rachel Lyne will forever regret her short-lived affair with the plumber who fixed her boiler.

She ended the relationship with Richard Holman after four weeks when she discovered he was married – but her troubles were only just beginning.

For seven years, the 48-year-old suffered the effects of a smear campaign masterminded by Holman and his furious wife.

The couple, who lived in a £1million farmhouse in Scorton, Lancashire, set up hundreds of fake online profiles branding her a prostitute and a benefits cheat.

She moved hundreds of miles away to escape the slurs, but faced a steady stream of men at her door expecting sex.

Eventually, police gave her a panic alarm and she resorted to putting a note outside her home stating it was not a brothel.

Yesterday 45-year-old Holman and his then wife Amanda – now divorced – were starting 26-week jail terms after being convicted of harassment. But many of the cruel profiles remain accessible.

After the hearing, Miss Lyne said the couple had ‘destroyed every little aspect of my life’, adding: ‘It’s gone on for seven years … It destroyed my relationship with my parents.

‘Friends and people I had known all my life were looking at me sideways. You can imagine the humiliation and embarrassment that it has brought to my family.’

Miss Lyne started a relationship with 
Holman after he fixed her boiler in 2007. She found out he was married 
when his wife answered his mobile phone, and immediately ended the 
affair.

Mrs Holman – a 
director of her husband’s gas fires firm – called her a ‘home-wrecker’ 
and a ‘whore’. Shortly after the romance was discovered, parcels of 
lingerie began arriving at Miss Lyne’s home and workplace.

Her
 parents and neighbours received letters alleging she was a prostitute, 
drug dealer and benefits cheat. Her dog went missing and was found 400 
miles away.

Hundreds of fake
 online dating and sex profiles were set up in her name, with up to four
 men a day appearing at her home expecting sexual services.

In
 2011 Miss Lyne moved to Cornwall with friend Stuart Walker. But the 
following year a man came to her door believing he had been speaking to 
her on a site called Happyslappers.com.

Police
 traced the profiles to Mrs Holman’s computer. One showed images of a 
bikini-clad woman captioned: ‘Look at my gorgeous body boys – come and 
see me.’

It calls Miss Lyne
 and Mr Walker ‘professional benefit cheats’. Scott Ainge, prosecuting, 
told Preston Magistrates’ Court: ‘[Miss Lyne] isn’t and never has been a
 prostitute and there is a rift between herself and her parents who 
believed the information they were being fed.’

The Holmans are understood to be planning an appeal.
