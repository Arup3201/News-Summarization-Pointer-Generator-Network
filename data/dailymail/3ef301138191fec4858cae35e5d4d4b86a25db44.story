Villarreal coach Marcelino has admitted he could sell defender Gabriel Paulista to Arsenal during the January transfer window.

Paulista has been heavily linked with a move to north London, with reports suggesting boss Arsene Wenger is ready to meet the club's £15.3million release fee.

Wenger has been under increased pressure to bring defensive reinforcements in to the club and has already confirmed that he will be active in the market.

And the Frenchman may get his man as Marcelino confirmed the defender could be sold this month. 

He told El Larguero: 'I hadn't considered selling Gabriel, it's bad news from a sporting point of view.

'But if both Gabriel and the club believe that his sale to Arsenal is the best for all parties, we will accept.'

Paulista has played every single match this season, helping Villarreal to sixth place in La Liga following a run of 15 games unbeaten.

Could the impending arrival of Paulista see Per Mertesacker lose his place in the Arsenal first team?

But the Brazilian defender hinted last weekend that a move to England is a definite possibility.

'Whether I go to Arsenal or stay at Villarreal, I won't lose my head,' said Paulista.

'I'm very calm. My head is at Villarreal and I'm very focused. My agent is working on making sure I continue being calm.'
