A suburban community has been left in shock after their Neighbourhood Watch organiser was shot dead as unarmed police carried out a drugs raid on his home.

Father-of-three Colin Berry, 49, died from gunshot wounds at his detached home in Buckingham Crescent, Bradford, after unarmed officers executed a warrant at lunchtime yesterday.

Neighbours have been left stunned as they knew the born-again Christian as a friendly family man who often patrolled the neighbourhood with his dog to deter criminals.

Neighbourhood Watch: A police officer guards the door of Colin Berry's home, where the father-of-three Neighbourhood Watch leader was shot dead following a struggle with police in a raid yesterday afternoon

Only the night before one, who preferred to remain anonymous, had spoken to Mr Berry as he walked the streets of Clayton and said he seemed in 'good spirits'.

But the following afternoon officers from West Yorkshire Police arrived at Mr Berry's £250,000 red-brick home, where he lived with his wife Janette, 40, and their three girls,  to carry out a search for illegal drugs.

The Local Neighbourhood Policing Team officers were all unarmed.

It is believed they were confronted by Mr Berry at the top of the stairs, who had his hands behind his back. Officers pursued him to the first floor, and, when he was asked to show his hands, he refused and officers tried to restrain him.

It is thought he was holding the weapon and it went off as he was being restrained. Mr Berry suffered fatal injuries and died at the scene. No officers were hurt.

It is not known whether his wife and daughters - who were enjoying the Easter holidays from St Anthony's Catholic Primary School - were at home at the time.

They are thought to be staying with relatives as forensics experts and investigators from the Independent Police Complaints Commission continue their inquiries.

Clayton residents have been left confused by the tragic turn of events that led to the unexpected death of their Neighbourhood Watch leader.

Susan Myers, who lives nearby and knew Mr Berry, said: 'Colin was supposed to be the Neighbourhood Watch organiser for this area and he would walk round at night with his Staffy.

'He was a pleasant fellow, but had a bit of a past. About two years ago he became a born again Christian and was trying to be a better person and do the right thing.

'He was talking about God and not been a bad'un any more.'

Cordoned off: Mr Berry was known in the area as a friendly family man, and neighbours have been left shocked by the tragic turn of events that led to his untimely death yesterday

Mr Berry, a well-built man who appeared to be a regular gym goer, was said to be in the security business. His wife, locals said, is self-employed in the fitness industry.

Another neighbour said Mr Berry was a security officer who she believed had his own company. She described him as a 'friendly, family man' who took his daughters to school and would always say hello.

Neighbours said that they had never before seen police at his home, which has CCTV cameras trained on its front door to monitor visitors.

Floral tributes have been placed at the police cordon that now surrounds the house.

One reads: 'Rest in Peace Colin, love Janet, Jeff, Andy, Martin and Barry xxx'

Clayton
and Fairweather Green Labour councillor Carol Thirkill said: 'It is 
tragic for his family and friends. I don't know the circumstances but it
is definitely a tragic incident that has occurred. You feel for his 
family.

'It is not something you expect to happen in any residential area.'

A
statement from West Yorkshire Police read: 'Shortly after 1pm on 
Thursday, local neighbourhood policing team officers attended an address
on Buckingham Crescent in the Clayton area of Bradford to conduct a 
drugs warrant.

'The officers were all unarmed.

'On entering the property, a struggle ensued with one of the occupants during which a firearm was discharged.

'The occupant, a 49-year-old man, received fatal injuries and died at the scene.

'As
a result of these circumstances, and in accordance with established 
procedures, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has been
informed and is attending the scene.'
