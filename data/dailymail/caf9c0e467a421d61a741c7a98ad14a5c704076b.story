Most people wouldn't choose to hang out with their gran while watching Nicki Minaj twerking and grinding on their computer screen - but most people aren't Kevin Droniak.

In the latest instalment of the 17-year-old YouTube star's adventures with his grandma BFF, the pair sit down to watch the American R&B star's provocative Anaconda music video, while he films her hilarious reaction.

The clip has already racked up almost half a million views, proving to be another hit for Droniak, from Newtown, Connecticut, and his firecracker nan, who lives in Shelton.

'Why would I want to watch this?' Grandma asks the teen as a scantily glad Minaj bumps and grinds on screen. 'No I don't like it, it's not my style.'

Diplomatically, she then adds: 'I wouldn't want to watch it every day.'

Grandma starts by noting that the video is not for her age group, but then adds: 'Even if I was 20 I wouldn't like it.'

Commenting on Minaj's skimpy attire, she announces: 'You're looking for trouble if you dress like that.'

But although Grandma insists that she does not find Minaj's video 'hot', she complimentary about the controversial rapper's famous physique.

She says: 'She's slim all over, she's got a figure.

'If she wants to be that, that's her business, that's none of my business.'

But Grandma is less than impressed when her grandson announces that Minaj is the sort of woman he would like to marry.

'Your marriage would never last if she was doing this,' she states.

Droniak and his grandma's rise to YouTube stardom began about two years ago when the teen decided to capture his gran's priceless wisdom by setting up a secret camera in her car.

That first video went viral, and since then Droniak has continued to capture their hilarious conversations - even after revealing his sneaky filming to his grandma.

In early August, Kevin showed her the YouTube videos he had posted of her and expected a furious reaction.

True to form, he filmed her watching herself, and her priceless reaction showed that she finds the videos almost as funny as her thousands of fans.

After the big revelation, Kevin admitted that his grandmother became a little more wary when a camera is around. But the teen assured the followers of his YouTube channel - which now total nearly 200,000 - that he will continue to capture more adventures with his gran.
