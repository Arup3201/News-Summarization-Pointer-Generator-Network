An 18-year-old California man pleaded no contest to setting his family's basset hound Buddy on fire in October.

Andrew Delgado, of Camarillo, California, said on Friday that he does not wish to contend with the two charges brought against him: one count of animal cruelty and one count of arson on a property.

Ventura County Superior Court Judge Kevin McGee told Delgado that he could be sentenced to as many as three years behind bars, the Ventura County Star reported.

McGee said that the judge who will issue
the sentence has indicated that he will give Delgado no more than 16 
months in jail. That judge could also consider probation with a sentence
of up to a year in jail. McGee said.

The prosecutor on the case, Richard Simon, said that he will fight for the maximum sentence of three years.

‘My client went ahead and took responsibility for what happened, and it's a sad case for everyone involved,’ Delgado's lawyer Rebekah Mathis of the Public Defender's Office told the Venture County Star.

Buddy was doused with petrol and burned alive before being left to die from the gruesome injuries it suffered in a ravine near the Delgado family’s home.

The incident occurred at 3.20 am on Saturday, October 27, according to the local sheriff’s office.

A neighbor spotted a small fire in a ravine that morning and alerted firefighters, who were horrified to discover the severely burned dog.

The three-year-old pooch died from his injuries a few hours later.

Jolene Hoffman, shelter director of the Ventura County Human Society, told the Ventura County Star at the time: ‘The torture that poor animal suffered — it makes you sick.

‘The cruelty that goes on — it still completely blows you away no matter how much you see or how much you witness.

Andrew Delgado will be sentenced on February 13.
