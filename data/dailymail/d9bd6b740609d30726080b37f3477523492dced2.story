Call for action: Graham Aaronson QC said failing to stop 'aggressive' tax avoidance could spark social unrest

There will be ‘riots on the streets’ if the Government fails to tackle wealthy tax dodgers, the architect of new anti-avoidance rules has warned.

Graham Aaronson QC, who has recommended banning ‘aggressive’ bill-reducing arrangements such as Jimmy Carr’s, said such practices were particularly wrong in an era of austerity.

The tax-specialist barrister said that when he learned of the comedian’s K2 scheme - which helps members lower cut payments to about 1 per cent - it made his ‘blood boil’.

He believes that ensuring the wealthy cannot ‘play fast and loose’ with their responsibility to contribute to the running of the country is essential to maintaining public order.

‘People on the street don’t want these schemes to go ahead,’ he said in an interview with The Times.

‘I feel very strongly that abusive tax schemes are antisocial and this sort of thing fuels the anger of the average person.

‘The tents have been pitched at St Paul’s and more riots in the streets are not far away if we don’t deal with this.’

Tax avoidance by individuals is estimated to cost the Treasury about £4.5billion a year. Corporations are believed to dodge an additional £30.5billion.

To tackle this shortfall, Prime Minister David Cameron last year asked Mr Aaronson to decide whether Britain needed a general anti-avoidance rule (GAAR).

Mr Aaronson, who insists he pays around 50 per cent tax, recommended such a rule in November.

He said it would improve HM Revenue and Customs' ability to tackle tax avoidance without damaging the competitiveness of the UK as a place to do business.

In the Budget in March, Chancellor George Osborne said a GAAR was necessary. Treasury officials are now drafting legislation to put make the recommendation law.

However, Mr Aaronson has rejected a ‘broad spectrum’ law that would tackle all schemes because, he argued, it would ‘undermine’ business.

Instead, avoidance arrangements falling foul of potential new rules would have to be seen as unreasonable on two levels.

Senior HMRC officials are said to fear that Mr Aaronson’s plan does not go far enough.

Calls for a firm crackdown have mounted since it was revealed 10 days ago that Mr Carr was among 1,100 K2 clients channelling their salaries though Jersey.

Mr Cameron further fuelled the row when he said that the scheme used by the comedian, who sheltered £3.5million as a result, was ‘morally wrong’.

Since then it has emerged that the Take That stars Gary Barlow, Howard Donald and Mark Owen, and their manager, poured £26million into another tax avoidance arrangement.

Olympic champion cyclist Chris Hoy was also forced to deny dodging tax by taking a loan back though his own company.

It has also emerged that 1,300 doctors are being investigated over allegations of tax evasion.

At the weekend, Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, cutting Britain’s £35billion ‘tax gap’ by a quarter could fund a 2p cut for all basic-rate income taxpayers.

It later emerged that the matter of investigating cases of ‘abusive’ avoidance may have been hampered by a shortage of tax inspectors due to cuts.

A backlog of 20,000 cases could take up to 38 years to complete, officials warned.

Mounting pressure to solve the cases was not helped by a strike by more than 50,000 HMRC workers yesterday.

The walk-out will be followed by other forms of action such as a ban on overtime.

PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka said: 'It is sickening to see millionaires in the cabinet wringing their hands about the immorality of tax avoidance when it is their lack of political will to act that means we lose tens of billions of pounds every year.

'The case for investment in our public services as an alternative to austerity could not be more obvious than it is in HMRC.

‘Yet the government wants to cut 10,000 more jobs from the department, letting the wealthy tax dodgers off the hook and punishing the rest of us for a recession we did not cause.'
