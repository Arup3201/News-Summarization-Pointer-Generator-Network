Nearly 900 footballers in England are out of contract next month with many of them still unsure of their futures.

The majority are already aware they will not receive a new deal and the players’ union, the Professional Footballers’ Association, will be braced for another summer of upheaval when the final figures are confirmed at the end of the month.

It is a stunning reminder of the uncertain world of professional football, where in recent summers around 500 footballers have been searching for new clubs.

Time running out: Ashley Cole (centre) looks set to leave Chelsea in the summer

These numbers include a wide range of players such as international stars like Frank Lampard, who is expected to extend his career at Chelsea, and Ashley Cole, who is not. There is Joleon Lescott  leaving Manchester City and Joe Cole departing from West Ham.

There are young professionals who have been unable to break through into the Barclays Premier League and are looking at their options.

Players like Josh Pritchard, who is leaving Fulham and looking to go abroad after loan spells at Tromso in Norway and FC Honka in Finland.

There are established Championship stars like Matt Derbyshire.

Wait: Frank Lampard's Chelsea contract is running out but he is expected to sign a new deal

The 28-year-old striker scored five goals in five games for Nottingham Forest at the end of the season but is not wanted by new manager Stuart Pearce.

There are those like Craig Bellamy who will call it a day at the end of full and rewarding careers — and many more forced to accept  at a young age that they will not have a career in the game.

This will be the area where the PFA’s expertise and specific exit  and retraining programmes are vital to many individuals. Much flux  surrounds promotion and relegation issues — those clubs in the play-off finals do not yet know which division they will be in — and down the  pyramid the trend is towards short contracts which guard against a  sudden worsening of fortunes.

This appeals to experienced players seeking new challenges, like Matthew Upson. He has turned down a year at Brighton for a one-year deal at Leicester, and another season at the top at the age of 35.

David Nugent and Kasper Schmeichel are poised to sign new deals at promoted Leicester, while 31-year-old Lloyd Dyer seems set to opt for the security of a longer deal at Watford rather than another 12 months at Leicester.

The influx of foreign players has limited the opportunities for British players but some, like Wales Under 21 international Pritchard, are willing to broaden their horizons and look overseas for opportunities, and not only on the well-trodden routes into North American football.

‘I’ve not really been looking in  England because I don’t want to stay here,’ said Pritchard, on loan at FC Honka until the end of this month.

The Finnish club are managed by former Sheffield Wednesday, Ipswich, Blackburn and Crystal Palace striker Shefki Kuqi, but the versatile 21-year-old Pritchard expects his future to be elsewhere.

‘I’ve been looking around Europe a lot,’ he said. ‘I prefer it abroad and the football is more suited to my style of play. There has been interest from Spain, Portugal, Italy and Holland. You can’t limit yourself. People get blinkers on and just want to play in England.

On the move: Matthew Upson has signed for Leicester City after leaving Brighton and Hove Albion

'I want to play in the Premier League, of course I do. It is the best in the world and it’s where everyone wants to play - but there are other options.

‘There are lots of places to go and play football at a high level where you can experience other cultures and lifestyles. Personally, I couldn’t have asked for more from my loan experiences in Finland and Norway.’

Others have taken a similar route. Liverpool-born Michael Higdon played in Holland last year after  joining NEC Nijmegen from Motherwell and Tom Hateley, son of former England international Mark, signed for Slask Wroclaw in Poland.
