Tesco is charging food companies thousands of pounds a year to ensure their products appear at eye level on its shelves.

A leaked memo has lifted the lid on a ploy believed to be used by most supermarkets to boost their profits at the expense of their suppliers.

In effect, Tesco and other retailers are charging food and household products companies for the right to sell their brands through their branches.

Food companies prepared to pay a premium sum will get products placed on the shelves at eye level in Tesco

Only those prepared to pay a premium figure will get their products placed on the shelves at eye level, where research shows they are more likely to be seen and purchased. However, the net effect of the tactic is that shoppers end up paying more for big-brand items.

A memo compiled by Tesco’s cooking ingredients buying manager, James Marshall, and sent to suppliers was leaked to The Grocer magazine by an angry supplier.

The memo explained that suppliers would be expected to pay £30 a product per store for lines to be stocked on two key eye-level shelves.

Consequently, a company wanting its products on these shelves at 600 Tesco stores for a full year could be charged £18,000.

There was a charge of £15 for products to be stacked on the top shelf or those at waist level, while there was no payment for the bottom shelf.

The Tesco email also included a diagram to highlight the benefits of being on the ‘hottest’ shelf. The shelves at eye level were coloured in red and featured images of the sun wearing sunglasses, while the bottom shelf was blue and included pictures of igloos.

While the system is a clear money-spinner for Tesco, it also helps large, well-off brands, which can afford such payments, at the expense of small independent food producers

While the system is a clear money-spinner for Tesco, it also helps large, well-off brands, which can afford such payments, at the expense of small independent food producers.

There has been controversy in the past about how supermarkets  have required manufacturers and farmers to fund special discount promotions by accepting lower prices for their products.

This has allowed the stores to present themselves as the shopper’s friend without having to suffer any cut in their profit margin.

Tesco insisted that charging suppliers more to put their products on eye-level shelves was not new and common practice among major retailers.

However, one supplier who received the email described it as a new tactic.He said: ‘Tesco are making it increasingly unattractive to do business with them. We won’t support this.

‘And as a leading brand, if we are then positioned on the bottom shelf, how is that serving the needs of the Tesco customer?’

The row is the latest evidence of an increasingly difficult relationship between Britain’s biggest supermarket, which has huge power to make or break brands, and manufacturers.

Tesco recently took 70 big brands made by the Princes company off its shelves, including Princes meat pies, Crosse & Blackwell soups and Napolina oils.

Neither company would explain why the two had fallen out.

However, rival suppliers suggested the dispute may have been over payments demanded by Tesco.

A Tesco spokesman said: ‘We work closely with our suppliers to build exciting ranges for our customers, and make our ranging decisions based primarily on what we think will work best for customers.

‘Suppliers often request changes to where their products are placed on shelves, for example to give more prominence to a new product. This practice is common across the industry.’
