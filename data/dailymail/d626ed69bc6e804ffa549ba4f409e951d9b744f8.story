Anyone who has witnessed the intensity of Wilfried Bony at close quarters will not be surprised that numerically he's been the most effective striker in the Premier League in 2014. But they might have been a little shocked to hear him say on Saturday that tallies do not always matter.

‘I really don’t care about statistics,’ he said in frustration after his 18th goal of the calendar year could only contribute to a 1-1 draw against Crystal Palace.

The wider context was a statement of the obvious that goals without wins mean less. But to underestimate how much goals and numbers mean to him would be a mistake.

The Ivorian's strike made him the highest scorer in the Premier League this calendar year

Sergio Aguero - 16

Edin Dzeko - 14

Yaya Toure - 14

Daniel Sturridge - 13

Wayne Rooney - 13

In January of this year, when Sportsmail spent an hour with the Ivorian in a function room at the Liberty Stadium, he spelled out the point. 

The speech came in response to a question about the flawed public perception that Swansea’s £12million record signing that summer was an easy-going guy.

'I have to be in control,' he said. 'I must. It is very important.'

At this point he brought his fist down against the table.

'I am a hard person - I am not an easy guy. I want always to be in control, everything I do in football and outside.

'At the end of the season I want to do this, after next season I want to do that. Goals, objectives. I know who can help me, who can't help me. The people who can help, from the beginning I talk to them - "I want that and that - you have to help me. And if you help me, I help you". 'I like to use my power. Wherever we go, in the disco or anywhere, I am always talking about this every day.

'I always tell my friends - Roland Lamah, (Wayne) Routledge, Jonathan de Guzman - if you have time to put in a cross do it because you know I am good with my head. You don't have to be in the box, give me the ball.

'If I head the ball one time it can be a goal. I try to be there in the right place. If I am not there, it is my mistake.

‘Didier Drogba texts me to say, “Don't let anyone destroy your objectives”. My objective is 20 goals with Swansea this season, then the World Cup and in the future I want to play the Champions League. No one will destroy my objectives.’

So that is why goals matter to Bony. At the time of the interview he had 13, having struggled initially to get regular game time under Michael Laudrup, who had preferred other striking targets that summer.

By the end of the season he had scored 25 and went to the World Cup. He has six goals already in this campaign. Will he get his move to the Champions League? That remains to be seen, but it would be naive to assume that the contract extension he signed last month signals an end to his ambitions.

Bony and his camp have been admirably and contentiously open about his intentions. Yes, he enjoys playing for Swansea in the Premier League and he will not agitate to leave as he did at Vitesse Arnhem before heading to South Wales.

But if a big opportunity came along, it is understood that he would want to take it. At a time when answers are heavily scrutinised by supporters and media alike, it is risky for a player or associate to state what might sound like the obvious.

But why should an Ivorian have an unbreakable bond with a club in South Wales? He likes the club, is happy there and is paid above the going rate for Swansea’s leading players. 

But those objectives he talks of will not be broken by a one-year extension to 2018, which was designed with the heavy objective of addressing the £19m buyout clause that would have landed a rival – most likely Liverpool – with a huge bargain.

Edin Dzeko has scored 14 goals this calendar, including some key strikes in City's title challenge

As Swansea’s deal with Vitesse in 2013 included clauses of a further £1.75m, based on performances, it is safe to assume they might have only made a profit of £5.25m on such a revelatory signing. 

With extra security, Swansea can, in the event of an approach, expect a significant return for a proven goal scorer who only turns 26 later this month.

The goals record of 30 in 75 games for Sparta Prague, 53 in 73 for Vitesse and 31 in 62 for Swansea would, quite conceivably, make him worth upwards of £30m. 

On the list of the 10 top scorers for 2014, he is the only player who finished last season in a club outside the top 10. Would his effectiveness and value go up in a bigger club?

In that same interview, Bony detailed the resistance he faced from his father, a teacher, to his dream of being a footballer.

He said: ‘He wanted me to continue in school. He paid for me to go to this school for a year but I said, "I don't want that, I want to play football so don't pay anything".

'He would say, "Go to school and after that you can play. There are other people, like doctors, who play football".

‘But I said, "Dad, no. Everyone has a destiny". He said, "I understand that but this is your problem now". Man, he went ******* crazy.’

Suffice to say, Bony was smart to keep his objectives.
