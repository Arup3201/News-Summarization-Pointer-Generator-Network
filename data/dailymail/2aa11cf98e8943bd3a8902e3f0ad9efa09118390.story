Sony employees have received threats to their families in the latest email from hacking group Guardians of Peace (GOP).

The warning on Friday afternoon came after the firm transferred their entire mail system to new servers following a security breach that saw five feature films and 47,000 social security numbers released.

Nonetheless, the email, written in broken English, told all Sony Pictures staff to join the GOP's petition against Sony 'if you don't want to suffer damage,' adding: 'not only you but your family will be in danger'.

Threat: Staff at Sony Pictures have received an email threatening to harm their families if they do not comply

Investigators have speculated the hack, first detected on November 24, was administered by North Korea in reaction to the upcoming comedy The Interview, which dramatizes an assassination plot on the nation's leader Kim Jong-un. 

A team has worked around the clock to clear the firm's computer system and barred all staff from accessing the WiFi in the meantime. 

But the latest message, obtained by Variety, suggests the hacking firm plans to continue meddling with Sony.

It read: 'I am the head of GOP who made you worry.

Removing Sony Pictures on earth is a very tiny work for our group which is a worldwide organization. And what we have done so far is only a small part of our further plan.It's your false if you if you think this crisis will be over after some time. All hope will leave you and Sony Pictures will collapse. This situation is only due to Sony Pictures. Sony Pictures is responsible for whatever the result is. Sony Pictues clings to what is good to nobody from the beginning. It's silly to expect in Sony Pictures to take off us. Sony Pictures makes only useless efforts. One beside you can be our member.

'Many things beyond imagination will happen at many places of the world. Our agents find themselves act in necessary places. Please sign your name to object the false of the company at the email address below if you don't want to suffer damage. If you don't, not only you but your family will be in danger. 

Bad news: More bad news in the Sony hack as it has been reported that 47,000 Social Security numbers for past and current employees were leaked, including actress Rebel Wilson

Victims: Among those who had their information taken were  Judd Apatow (left) and Sylvester Stallone (right)

'Nobody can prevent us, but the only way is to follow our demand. If you want to prevent us, make your company behave wisely.'

It comes after the details of Sony employees including director Judd Apatow and actors Rebel Wilson and Sylvester Stallone were leaked from the firm's system.

The leaked numbers belong to both past and current employees of the studio juggernaut.  

The studio had no comment on this most recent leak according to the Wall Street Journal.

It came shortly after it was revealed that financial records had became public that detailed how much stars like Seth Rogen and James Franco were making, as well as studio heads Michael Lynton and Amy Pascal.

The hackers also uploaded five yet-to-be-released films to file-sharing websites, including the Brad Pitt film Fury, still in theaters, and Annie, the much-anticipated remake set for a December 19 release.

The company has been trying to take the videos off the internet with cease-and-desist orders.

Pay information for more than 31,000 employees at Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Ltd, a financial firm hired by Sony, were taken in the hack as well. 

The pay information from 2005 revealed that there are far more men than women with high-paying salaries.

The list was leaked to a reporter at news and pop culture site Fusion.

Kevin Roose, reporting for Fusion, who was sent a link to the data by an anonymous source, said: 'When I sorted the list by 'annual rate,' I noticed something notable: a stark homogeneity among the people earning the most.

'Based on the spreadsheet ... the employees of Sony Pictures with the highest annual rates appear to be nearly entirely white men.'

Buzzfeed reviewed almost 40GB of leaked internal data and reported it included 'employee criminal background checks, salary negotiations, and doctors' letters explaining the medical rationale for leaves of absence.'

It reported the files also included a script for an unreleased pilot written by Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan as well as 'email exchanges with employees regarding specific medical treatments they are undergoing, while one disciplinary letter details a manager's romantic relationship and business travel history with a subordinate.'

The leaked information even includes an email about the breastfeeding diet of a senior executive.

One aspect of the leak, which probably has the Sony IT team reeling, is the several spreadsheet and text documents where employees stored their passwords...under the name 'password'. 

The hack is thought to be carried out by those allied with the North Korean regime, unhappy with the country's portrayal in the film.

In June, a North Korean official appeared on the state-run news station to say the country would pursue 'a strong and merciless countermeasure' if Sony released the film.

Despite the threat, Sony has continued to roll out promotion for the movie ahead of it's December 25 release date.

Responsible? Sources close to the internal investigation of the hack at Sony say they believe a North Korean group is behind the attack. Officials in North Korea previously threatened action

Exactly one month before it was set to be released, Sony confirmed that the company had been hacked, and that the mysterious group behind the cyber attack released hundreds of company documents online. The day before, an alleged warning posted to Reddit read: 'This is just the beginning'.

Sony has yet to officially name North Korea as the source of the cyber attack, but sources close to the internal investigation spoke out on Wednesday to say they believe a group known as DarkSeoul is to blame. 

The group associated with North Korea was thought to be behind the large-scale March 2013 attack on South Korean banks and broadcasters.

Other evidence from the hack points to the regime, including Korean-language coding, in similarities to other attacks by DarkSeoul.

The results of the internal investigation into the attack, currently being carried out by FireEye's Mandiant forensics unit, are expected to be announced later this week.

Earlier this week, a North Korean spokesperson refused to deny claims that it was behind the move and would only say 'wait and see' when asked if Pyongyang was involved.
