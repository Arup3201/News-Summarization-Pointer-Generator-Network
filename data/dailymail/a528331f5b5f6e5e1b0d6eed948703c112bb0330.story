The US Hispanic population will be responsible for 40 percent of the country's employment growth over the next five years and more than 75 per cent by 2034, a new study found. 

The report from economic forecaster IHS Global Insight said they will eventually account for an increase of 11 million jobs out of 14 million new positions. 

Because the Hispanic population is 'younger and faster-growing', higher levels of immigration are 'conducive' to helping U.S. economic growth, the study concludes.

'The Hispanic population will play an increasingly significant role in future U.S. employment growth,' said James Gillula, the report's lead author. 

He said that, by contrast, the non-Hispanic population is aging as the baby-boomer generation moves into retirement.  

The country's workforce has slowly been declining over the last 10 years, the Wall Street Journal reports. 

Almost half of the Hispanic labor force last year was under the age of 35 and less than 12 per cent of it was 55 years or older - compared to more than 33 per cent of the non-Hispanic labor force. 

The study conducted two separate investigations to show how the economy would be affected by different levels of Hispanic population growth, according to the Wall Street Journal. 

The forecast assuming higher Hispanic immigration growth showed that the country's gross domestic product could increase by 3 per cent annually from 2020 to 2034. 

In contrast the baseline study, assuming a more restricted immigration policy, showed a 2.5 per cent increase. 

The findings comes just days before the Homeland Security Department will run out of funding.

In Obama's annual economic report, the White House said growing the workforce, which has slowly been declining over the last 10 years, will be the best way to stabilize the nation's debt

Last month Republicans in the House of Representatives passed a bill that would finance the department while simultaneously repeal recent executive actions by President Obama to protect millions of immigrant families from being deported. 

President Obama said he would veto any legislation attempting to curtail his changes to immigration policy. 

In Obama's annual economic report, released last week, the White House said growing the workforce will be the best way to stabilize the nation's debt.

Proposed incentives include a $500 tax credit for married couples that consist of two working spouses and tripling tax credit to help cover child care.
