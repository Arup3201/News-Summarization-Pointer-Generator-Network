A drug dealer, claiming to be an ex-boyfriend of Harriet Wran, says the former NSW premier’s daughter relapsed after partying with him on his birthday which saw him spend more time in jail for breaching his parole.

Released just two days ago, Sonny Khetkan, 29, said he spent a further 38 days behind bars after taking drugs while celebrating his birthday on July 10 with Wran, who has been charged with two other men for the murder of Daniel McNulty.

‘She came over to see me on my birthday and then I got caught with dirty urine and breached my parole,’ the drug dealer told a friend who informed The Saturday Telegraph. 'I was devastated by what happened to her. I love her and she loves me.'

Khetkan said he was planning to visit Wran in Silverwater women’s prison, who he claims to have met in 2011 while selling drugs to her friends in Bondi.

He told the friend that one thing led to another and he stayed on.

But he insisted Wran was not a drug addict and that she was unaware of his dealings.

‘She takes drugs but she is not a full-on ice addict,’ he said.

Wran, 26, was arrested on August 13 and later charged with murder, along with her friend of two weeks Michael Lee, 35, and a man she had just met, Lloyd Haines, 29.

Khetkan told his friend that Wran’s mother Jill 'hates' him after he picked up her daughter from a 12-week, $80,000 rehabilitation program in Queensland after just two days.

The Wran family told the Saturday Telegraph that Khetkan was 'a piece of slime'.

Khetkan claims he still has some of Wran’s belongings which she left with him when she went into rehab programs while they were together.

'We tried to keep apart, I wanted her to be clean,' he told the friend.

Khetkan was released from jail in October last year after being arrested in August 2012 on drug charges.

After her arrest the self-confessed ice addict told police she was 'numb on ice' desperate for a hit when she went to suspected drug dealer Mr McNulty's unit and was 'frozen' with fear during a fight which saw Mr McNulty killed and a second man, Brett Fitzgerald, wounded on his neck.

A former friend of Wran's earlier came forward to describe her as a  'sensitive, caring, sweet woman', and the strength Ms Wran has showed over the years in her fierce battle with depression and addiction.

Wran's friend, who wished to remain anonymous, insists that at heart Harriet Wran is 'a sweet, driven, intelligent' person and the public needs to understand the complexity of her situation.

'Harriet is a sensitive, caring, incredibly intelligent young woman but she struggled with the expectations of her family, which includes father Neville a former NSW premier.

Her godfather was also the late billionaire Kerry Packer.
