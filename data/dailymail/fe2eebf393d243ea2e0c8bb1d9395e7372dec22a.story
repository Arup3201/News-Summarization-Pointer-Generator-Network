Ed Miliband's chances of getting into Downing Street have been damaged as he struggled to draw a line under Labour's snobbery row, a senior member of his frontbench warned yesterday.

The embattled leader was accused of being out of touch by his own MPs as party figures publicly feuded over his handling of the Rochester by-election crisis.

Mr Miliband also faced a series of stinging attacks from his senior colleagues, including claims he had made the situation worse.

Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves said the Labour leader had been right to sack his close ally Emily Thornberry – but suggested the row had weakened his election chances.

Miss Reeves said the shadow attorney general been 'condescending and disrespectful' when she posted a tweet that appeared to sneer at a white van driver whose home was decked with England flags.

'I think it's right that she's no longer in her job because what she was suggesting doesn't represent the ethos and the values of the Labour Party,' she told the BBC's Sunday Politics. 'I was angry when I saw it because I'm working hard, as are other Labour MPs and activists, trying to get a Labour government back in six months' time and she set that process back.'

However, former Labour minister Diane Abbott led the revolt against Mr Miliband, saying he had over-reacted by getting rid of the frontbencher.

'I think he made a mistake sacking her because apart from anything else it implied she had said something about the man's house, which she hadn't,' she told Sky News. 'But more important I think it made it a bigger story than it otherwise would have been.'

Meanwhile, another senior MP said the episode showed Mr Miliband needed to tear down his 'Berlin Wall' of north London liberal allies and reconnect with normal voters if he wants to win the election.

Frank Field said Mr Miliband was right to fire Miss Thornberry, who lives in a £3million home in her Islington South and Finsbury constituency. 'Ed's trying to move us on immigration and welfare and with one blast of a tweet she wrecks that and puts us back to square one,' he told the Sunday Times.

Mr Field added: 'It's the north London set we've got to control. They are a Berlin Wall trying to prevent us reaching out to our voters and like the Berlin Wall they've got to be demolished.'

Gordon Brown is to announce 'within days' that he is stepping down as an MP at the next general election, sources said yesterday.

The ex-Premier is said to be planning to focus on his international charity work. He is a UN Special Envoy for Global Education.

Mr Brown is credited with saving the Union by giving a barnstorming speech against Scottish independence the day before this year's referendum.

An ally told the Sunday Mirror: 'He wants to go out on a high after salvaging the campaign to keep the UK together. He will focus on his charity work.'

Mr Brown, 63, has been an MP since 1983.
