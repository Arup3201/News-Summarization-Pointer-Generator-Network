The floaty white halterneck dress held down by a giggling Marilyn Monroe as it blew up over a subway grate in The Seven Year Itch has been voted the most iconic screen outfit of all time.

Monroe's fluttery 1955 costume topped a list of cinema's sartorial highlights, followed closely by the pretty blue gingham frock and ruby slippers worn by Judy Garland as Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz in 1939.

Olivia Newton-John's famous 'oh, hey there, Danny' outfit, worn at the fairground in the end of Grease - black leather trousers, red mules and red lips - came in at number three, and the red swimsuits favoured by the lifeguards in Baywatch won the number four spot.

The survey was commissioned by the British Heart Foundation to mark the launch of its 'Ramp up the Red' campaign, and indeed red - along with white and black - ranked pretty high as key tones to create a memorable on-screen impression.

Michael Jackson's red leather Thriller suit of 1983, and animated man-eater Jessica Rabbit's plunging red evening gown all made the top ten.

Indeed, more than half of us say red is the sexiest colour clothing to wear (54 per cent), while one third (30 per cent) say they would don a red item to feel confident or sexy.

Hilary Alexander OBE, former Fashion Director of The Daily Telegraph, is supporting the campaign.

She said: 'The study shows red is key when it comes to making an enduring style statement, whether itâ€™s a flash of red lipstick or a scarlet evening gown.

'The most iconic outfits date back over 100 years and it is clear red has always been a traffic-stopping colour that grabs people's attention and keeps outfits front of mind.'

BHF is asking the British public to Ramp up the Red on 7 February by wearing red and making a donation.

Alexander added: 'I will be ramping up the red on 7 February and showing heart disease the red light.

'It is a cause that is very close to me as I had open heart surgery a few years ago. Every pound raised will go towards the fight for every heartbeat to help people like me.'

Polly Shute, Fundraising Project Director at the BHF, said: 'Wearing red is not only a fabulous way to make you stand out from the crowd but can also help a great cause.

'By ramping up the red on 7 February with friends and colleagues you have the chance to be a style icon for a day and help raise vital funds.

'These will assist the BHF continue its vital research, support and care for those living with heart disease.'
