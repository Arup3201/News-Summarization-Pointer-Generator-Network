Every parent wants to protect their child but one father in Russia took this to the extreme when he apparently fired a gun to force a driver to stop at a pedestrian crossing.

A short 30 second clip entitled 'Crazy Russian Guy Shoots With Gun To Stop Car' has been viewed more than 45,000 times after it was uploaded to the internet yesterday.

Filmed from the dashboard of the car, it shows a man dressed in a blue T-shirt and dark jeans holding the hand of a young boy as the driver approaches a pedestrian crossing.

Lethal weapon: A Russian father appears to hold up a gun to stop traffic at a pedestrian crossing in a 30 second clip uploaded to the internet

Threat: A black object which appears to be a gun can be seen in the man's right hand while he holds the hand of a young child in the other

As the car slows, the man can be seen holding what appears to be a gun in his hand which he apparently shoots twice.Â 

The father then crosses the road with the young boy dressed in a red and white stripped top.

Viewers' comments over the man's actions were mixed with many claiming that he was justified in using the threat of a weapon for his child' safety while others said he placed the boy in more danger.

@Adam Harris wrote on the website Liveleak.com: 'Educating drivers about crosswalks... one at a time. His daughter probably got hit once. But never again.'

Caught on camera: Once the car driver, who filmed the incident from a camera on his dashboard, stops at the crossing, the man starts to cross with the young boy

@Eternal21 added: 'I agree. Not quite the legal way but it's the only way to cross a street in a country where drivers haven't learned about brakes, road signs, driving rules...'

Others pointed out it was unlikely to be a real gun but most likely a replica which fires blanks and is very popular in Russia.

Just look at that other video of 3 russian thugs getting out of a car. One armed with a gun and a knife; eventually slashing the victims tyres. What if that car stopped and the driver had a real gun?'

Replica: Many viewers suggested that the weapon was just a replica that fires blanks rather than real bullets

Argument: Opinion was mixed on whether the man's actions were justified because of dangerous drivers in Russia while others said he out his child at more risk of harm
