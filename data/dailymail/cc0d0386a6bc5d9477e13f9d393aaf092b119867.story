DJ Dave Lee Travis, 68, is charged with the indecent assault of 11 girls and women between 1976 and 2008

Dave Lee Travis today admitted being quizzed by bosses over allegations he had touched a female colleague’s legs despite telling police he could not remember the incident.

But he denied tailoring his evidence to fit the facts telling jurors he is 'not exactly Sherlock Holmes'.

The DJ was being quizzed over claims he rubbed the legs of a woman at Chiltern Radio station and thrust his hand up her skirt.

Southwark Crown Court heard in his police interview Travis originally said he could not remember any sex complaint being made against him at the station, where he had a show on Classic Gold FM.

But as he was being questioned in the witness stand for the fourth day, Travis admitted he remembered being led into his boss’ office and told a female colleague had complained he touched her leg.

The former Top of the Pops presenter admitted he could have brushed against the woman’s leg during a heated argument.

But he branded claims he molested the woman were '100 per cent fabricated'.

He said: 'I’m clever enough to be a DJ and do my own stuff on the radio and television.

'But I’m not exactly Sherlock Holmes, and can’t work out the best way of telling a story. My best way of telling anything is telling you the truth.

'I’m telling you the truth now. I can only tell you the truth. I’m remembering it.'

He added: 'I haven’t been sat here listening to witnesses and saying that’s what I’ll say there.

'I’m trying to give you my account, my true account of what I recall.'

Travis, 68, admitted he was a very tactile person and would often hug women, kiss them on the cheek and given them a shoulder massage to say hello

Ms Moore QC, prosecuting, put it to Travis that 'You are tailoring what you are saying because what you are saying in interview simply doesn’t stand up.'

But Travis insisted he was not changing his story to fit other witnesses accounts that back up the allegations.

He said: 'I’m not tailoring anything, I’m simply telling you the truth as I know it.

'I’m not changing anything, I’m not exaggerating anything, I’m simply telling you what I remember.'

Travis, 68, admitted he was a very tactile person and would often hug women, kiss them on the cheek and given them a shoulder massage to say hello.

But he furiously denied rubbing a female colleague’s breasts as he gave her a bear hug when they were introduced.

Travis said he was left 'shaky' when police quizzed him over the allegations because he had never been arrested before 

And he branded claims he groped two women at the station, who were both in their 20’s, 'completely false'.

The court had earlier heard that a woman 'went ballistic' and branded him a pervert when he allegedly stuck his hand up her skirt.

But Travis angrily denied the claims saying 'Completely 100 per cent fabricated.

'I didn’t do something to her. I was standing with her having an argument, I may have touched her legs with my leg or knees but it is not something I did to her.

'It is something that happened because I’m in close proximity.'

And he rubbished claims that women at the station would lower their gaze when he walked into a room to avoid his unwanted attentions.

He said: 'Nobody ever put their heads down when I walked in the newsroom. Ever.'

Travis said he was left 'shaky' when police quizzed him over the allegations because he had never been arrested before.

And he said this might explain the discrepancy in his account.

He said: 'Everytime I’ve been with the police it has been a time of stress and strain.

'I’ve never been arrested in my life so I consider I was feeling a little bit shaky about that.'

He is accused of four counts of indecent assault against two women at the station between 2000 and 2003.

The court broke for half an hour to allow Travis, who has back problems, time to rest.

Travis denies 13 indecent assaults and one sexual assault involving 11 woman and spanning 30 years.

The case continues.
