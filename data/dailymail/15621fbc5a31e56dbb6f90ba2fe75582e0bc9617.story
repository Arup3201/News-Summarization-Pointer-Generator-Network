Pride and joy: DJ Mollie Green feeding her hens before they were stolen on April 30

A DJ has told how 'evil' chicken thieves stole her precious pet poultry, and is offering a a £2,000 reward for their safe return.

Mollie Green had rescued most of her 20 hens and two turkeys from battery farms and says that she will 'never get over it'.

She lovingly refers to them as her 'girls' and named the turkeys George and Maud.

The theft from a paddock at her home near Coventry, West Midlands, is especially cruel as 16 of the hens were ill and disabled.

Four raiders were caught on CCTV cutting their way into the wired enclosure with sacks in hand ready to snatch the birds.

A few minutes later they had filled the sacks with the birds which they slung into the back of a van and drove away at 10.15pm on Tuesday, April 30.

'If anyone has looked after an injured animal they'll know the bond is incredible,' said the 38-year-old DJ who works for BBC WM and is married to Richard, who also works in radio.

'That's what these animals are to me, I was responsible for each and every one of them.

'We've had George and Maud for over five years, they are part of the family.'

'I'm still devastated. I'll never get over it. It's the not knowing. I know they're somewhere around here but I don't know where they are.'

'The overwhelming sense of responsibility for their lives is what I live with. For someone to snatch them away and end their lives that way is unspeakable. It's evil.'

'Commercial chickens are the most abused animals on earth and they are in my care, there's nobody else.'

To the rescue: Mollie Green with a hen that she rescued from a battery farm

'These animals have no value in the world except to me, I'm responsible for their little souls.'

Mrs Green, who volunteers for the British Hen Welfare Trust, gave a home to the recused birds.

The theft of domestic fowl has been on the rise in the UK since it has become fashionable to keep poultry as pets and a source of fresh eggs.

The cost of the animals has shot up from around £5-per-bird to £30, according to the Domestic Fowl Trust.There are also fears that the birds could have been stolen for food.

Heartbroken: Mollie is offering a reward for the safe return of her 20 hens and two turkeys

Appealing for information about her beloved birds, she said: 'This is time critical, some might still be alive.

'But some won't have survived. Quite a few are on medication or need to be hand fed. They won't be alive without me.'

Mollie tearfully recounts the images of the thieves captured on CCTV.

'It was the worst thing I ever had to sit and watch,' she says.

Evidence: Pictured is CCTV of a van captured near Mollie's home on Tuesday 30 April between 10.15pm and 10.30 pm

'But if everyone could look out for this van. It is a long wheel base, semi high top, Ford Transit type van. The colour's not clear, but it's definitely not white.

'If enough people print out and keep the picture in their cars, we will find this van.'

A spokesman for West Midlands Police said that anyone with information should call 101.
