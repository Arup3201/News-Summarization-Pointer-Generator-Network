Earlier this year Cara Delevingne posted some photographers of herself posing with a group of owls on Instagram.

And whilst it seemed like just another day in the weird and wonderful world of the quirky 20-year-old, the real reason behind her seemingly random snaps has been revealed.

Cara has just been announced as the star of Mulberry's autumn/winter 13 campaign, which sees her posing with her furry friends and the latest range of handbags.

An owl of a time: Cara Delevingne's latest campaign sees her posing with some owl for Mulberry

Shot by renowned photographer Tim Walker and directed by Ronnie Cooke Newhouse, the British luxury brand's campaign aims to celebrate the beauty and mystery of the English countryside.

Shot on location at Shotover House in Oxfordshire, set designer Shona Heath recreated a snapshot of a wild and romantic woodland inside the manor house setting- owls and all.

In a fairy tale-esque scene, Cara poses in a tree with flower-tipped branches and holds real owls as she showcases the label's latest arm candy offerings.

With slicked back hair, rouge lips and rosy cheeks, the stunning model even balances the birds on her chunky block heels.

The key bags featured include the Willow - as seen on Kim Sears at Wimbledon this week - as well as the new Primrose, the iconic Bayswater and its new incarnation the Bayswater Double Zip Tote in Oxblood, Taupe, Navy and Emerald.

Emma Hill, former Creative Director of Mulberry, said at the time of the shoot: ‘The Autumn Winter 2013 collection was inspired by the English countryside and cosy, familiar rural scenes but with a dark, mysterious and seductive veil.

'Traditional fables, botanical prints and the earthiness of the countryside by night all played their part, and this sense of dark beauty was beautifully captured by Tim and Ronnie for the campaign.

'After closing our London Fashion Week show, Cara was the first name in my mind for this season, she’s beautiful, bold and British!’

Ronnie Cooke Newhouse, Art Director, House and Holme, added: 'An imaginative tableau of Cara Delevingne and her very lively woodland owl friends… Served up very English, very beautiful, and very, very cool.’ 

Mulberry launched the campaign 
exclusively on its website and social media channels, with galleries on 
Facebook and Google+ as well as sharing via Twitter Pinterest Instagram 
and Weibo.

This isn't the first time that Mulberry have called in Cara as a clothes horse.

The model-of-the-moment walked the runway back in February before the likes of front row contenders Anna Wintour, British Vogue 
editor Alexandra Shulman and singer Lana del Ray.

It all makes sense now: Cara posted this quirky snap with the owls on her Instagram at the start of the year

Cara has been keeping quite a low profile in recent weeks after partying into the early hours with Rihanna last fortnight.

She did, however, showcase her drumming skills at make-up
 artist Charlotte Tilbury's House of Rock 'N' Kohl event in 
Selfridges yesterday.
