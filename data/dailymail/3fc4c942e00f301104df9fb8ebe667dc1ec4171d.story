Oh, the pain. After all the waiting, the excitement and anticipation, Andy Murray’s name stays off the Wimbledon champions’ board for another year.

The prospect of seeing a Brit in the final for the first time in 73 years – and maybe even its first champion since 1936 – was snatched away by the mighty Spaniard Rafael Nadal in the semi-final for the second year in a row.

The 24-year-old Scot finished close to tears after winning the first set, then  being overwhelmed by Nadal’s power.

But he can still hold his head high 
as the best British player in decades – and the way his game has 
improved, he will have many more chances of Grand Slam glory.

Asked if he had cried, Murray, who 
also lost in the semis two years ago, to Andy Roddick, replied: ‘Not 
today.’  What was it like to get this far and lose? ‘It’s tough,’ he 
said. ‘But I’m giving it my best shot each time and I’m trying my 
hardest – that’s all you can do.’

Of Nadal, he said: ‘He’s one of the  best players ever, and a great athlete  on top of that.’

Nadal told the BBC: ‘Seriously, I 
feel sad for Andy. Against him I have to play my best to have any chance
and that’s what I had to do today.’

Asked what Murray needs to do to win a major, he said: ‘I think he’s playing well enough, probably a little more luck.’

The 25-year-old reigning  champion 
destroyed Murray’s new-found confidence, returning some seemingly 
impossible  balls to earn a final clash with  Novak Djokovic.

Nadal turned the clock back to reveal
flashes of the swearing, uncontrolled, cap-throwing Murray which had 
rarely been seen this year.

Murray’s defeat wiped out all that 
talk of comparison to Fred Perry, the last Brit to win the title in 
1936, and Bunny Austin, the last to get to the final two years later.

Naturally the women in his life – mother Judy and girlfriend Kim Sears – saw every second of it from the players’ box.

Not alone: Fans of the Spanish sensation also flocked to Wimbledon to support their idol

Their faces became the barometer for 
Murray’s progress, then the lack of it. Judy clapped with hands aloft 
and shouted: ‘You can do it!’ to gee him up; leapt to her feet to share 
moments of triumph; then became increasingly grim-faced.

Kim sat in 
silent synchronisation alongside her and spent a great deal of time 
nervously tossing her hair. Whatever happens in the future, the 
cliffhanger match they witnessed will be remembered as the day Murray 
looked as if he might do it.

But even with the nation’s hopes 
pinned on him, the prospect apparently wasn’t worthy of filling the 
Royal Box throughout. Fifty of the 75 seats remained empty for the first
three games, with the royals represented by the Duke of York and his 
daughter Princess Beatrice.

Pippa Middleton parked her celebrated 
derriere in the stalls. Nor was it an occasion for which Murray felt the
need to be clean-shaven. The straggly facial fluff he has sported for 
the entire tournament was still in evidence.

Hundreds of fans had camped out all night for the chance to be here on a day when tennis glory could have been in the offing.

Four thousand backsides eventually 
bagged places on the hillside renamed Murray Mount in his honour. 
Another 4,000 fans watched on a separate screen inside Court Two.

The grass slope was dotted with Union
Flags, Scottish Saltires and occasional flashes of Spanish national 
colours. Surrey (where Murray lives, remember) does have a county flag 
but curiously, none was visible.

Wimbledon eventually could have a second court with a retractable roof.

Having wrapped up a 15-year renovation project, the All England Club is contemplating future work, and one possible change being considered is adding a cover for Court 1.

Centre Court has had a roof since the 2009 tournament.

Wimbledon spokesman Johnny Perkins says that 'everything is up for discussion' and adds that 'a Court 1 roof can't be ruled in, but couldn't be ruled out'.

There are two retractable roofs at the Australian Open, and the French Open says it will have a retractable roof on its main stadium by 2016.

The U.S. Tennis Association says it does not plan to put a roof on Arthur Ashe Stadium, the top court for the U.S. Open.
