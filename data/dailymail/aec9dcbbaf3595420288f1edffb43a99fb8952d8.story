Former Democratic presidential contender John Edwards was today described as a 'master manipulator' at the start of a trial that could see him handed a lengthy prison sentence.

Prosecutors are trying to prove that the ex-Senator knew that $1m in donations to his 2008 presidential campaign was intended to prevent his family finding out about his mistress.

He faces six charges including conspiring to solicit funds and taking illegal campaign contributions- each of which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.

But his defence argues that the donations handled by his staffer Andrew Young were gifts from friends who wanted to hide the affair. They claim most of most of the money was siphoned of by Mr Young's to renovate his home.

Mr Young has struck a plea deal with prosecutors and is due to take the stand against his former boss.

'Master manipulator': John Edwards arrives outside federal court with his daughter Cate in Greensboro

Possible defence witness: Rielle Hunter, the former mistress of John Edwards, enters the federal courthouse in Raleigh, North Carolina, Thursday, August 6, 2009 with the pair's child Frances Quinn Hunter

But the defence today tried to undermine him by revealing that he had a one night stand with another witness in 2007.

U.S District Court Judge Catherine C. 
Eagles said that former Edwards aide Andrew Young slept with a young 
campaign employee and also contacted three other witnesses in the past 
two weeks to consult with them about their planned testimony.

Calling
into question the credibility of the key prosecution witness, Young had
agreed to testify against his former boss in the hope that he will 
avoid prosecution himself in the fallout from the trial of almost $1 
million of misappropriated campaign funds by Edwards.

The judge ruled that lawyers for Edwards
could mention the improper contact to
jurors in opening arguments Monday, but barred them from using the term 
'witness tampering' or telling the jury that Young had a one-night
stand with one of the other witnesses in 2007.

The former aide is
potentially the government's most important witness as prosecutors seek to
prove the then-married Democratic candidate masterminded a scheme to use nearly
$1 million provided by two wealthy campaign donors to help hide his pregnant mistress
as he sought the White House in 2008.

Young once falsely claimed paternity of
the child Edwards fathered with his then-mistress Rielle Hunter in 2007.

Edwards, 58, has pleaded not guilty to
six criminal counts related to alleged violations of federal campaign finance
laws.

The former candidate sat silently in the
courtroom Monday morning as the lead federal prosecutor called him a man who
would say or do anything to get elected president, including violating the law
to hide his affair and keep his campaign viable.

'It wasn't just a marriage on the
line,' said prosecutor David Harbach.

'If the affair went public it
would destroy his chance of becoming president, and he knew it. ...He made a
choice to break the law.'

The judge seated 12 jurors and four alternates Monday morning.

The panel is
made up of nine men and seven women drawn from central North Carolina, the
state that elected Edwards to serve one term in the U.S. Senate.

A defense lawyer for Edwards told the
jury that most of the money at issue in the case went not to support Hunter,
but was siphoned off by Young and his wife to build a $1.5 million 'dream home'
near Chapel Hill.

Former candidate Edwards' lawyers contend the payments were gifts from friends
intent on keeping the candidate's wife from finding out about the affair. 

Tragically, Elizabeth Edwards
died in December 2010 after battling cancer.

A key issue will be whether Edwards knew about the payments made on his
behalf by his national campaign finance chairman, the late Texas lawyer Fred
Baron, and campaign donor Rachel "Bunny" Mellon, a now-101-year-old
heiress and socialite.

Each had already given Edwards' campaign the maximum
$2,300 individual contribution allowed by federal law.

Edwards denies having known about the
money, which paid for private jets, luxury hotels and Hunter's medical care.
Prosecutors will seek to prove he sought and directed the payments to cover up
his affair, protect his public image as a 'family man' and keep his
presidential hopes viable.

It is alleged as part of this, Young and his wife invited the pregnant
Hunter to live in their home near Chapel Hill and later embarked with her on a
cross-country odyssey as they sought to elude tabloid reporters trying to
expose the candidate's extramarital affair.

Former aide Young later fell out with Edwards and
wrote an unflattering tell-all book, 'The Politician.'

And just recently, Young and Hunter ended a two-year legal battle over ownership of a sex tape the
mistress recorded with Edwards during the campaign, agreeing to a settlement
that dictates that copies of the video will be destroyed.

While Young is expected to be a witness for
the prosecution, the defense is likely to call Hunter to testify.

Two of
the lawyers who represented Hunter in her civil suit against the former aide
joined Edwards' legal team last month.

After years of adamant public denials,
Edwards acknowledged paternity of Hunter's daughter, Frances Quinn Hunter, in 2010.

The girl, now 4,
lives with her mother in Charlotte and is visited frequently by Edwards.

And despite rumours Edwards and Hunter were looking to get married, a recent sighting reported to the New York Post claims the one-time secret romance is no more.

The old flames were seen eating together at
Rooster's Wood Fire Kitchen in Charlotte where they often take their 
daughter Frances Quinn, four, and apparently looked far from a couple in
love.

A staff member at the restaurant said: 'They
didn't seem romantic. You would think that they were a married couple 
if you didn’t know them. He sat across from her in a booth.'

Hunter's publicist Rosemarie Terenzio confirmed the couple see each other often but not romantically.

She
told the Post: 'No, she wasn’t ever engaged to him. They see each other
often. They raise Quinn together and they do so extremely amicably.'
