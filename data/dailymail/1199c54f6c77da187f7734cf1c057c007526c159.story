Bicycle theft can put people off from investing in a stylish ride with lots of useful features.

But now a collaboration between two Seattle-based firms has created a bike that’s handlebars can be used as a bike lock – so cyclists don’t have to lug a heavy lock around with them.

The Denny bike not only features a smart lock, but also has lots of safety features, an automatic gear shifter, built-in lights and a motor to help cyclists up hills.

The Denny bike (pictured) not only features handlebars that can be used as a removeable lock, but also has an automatic gear shifter, built-in lights and has a motor to help cyclists up hills

While the design started as a concept, it will be available to buy next year.

The Denny bike was the brainchild of designers from Seattle-based design firm Teague and Sizemore Bicycle. It won Oregon Manifest’s Bike Design Project, which aims to create the ultimate urban bike. 

Its creators say: ‘The Denny bike is about returning the rider…to those early days of carefree riding, when cycling was just about “get up and go” freedom - the reason we all fell in love with bikes in the first place.’

They were inspired to create the bike to suit a life in Seattle so riders ‘don’t have to worry about the hills, rain or an impromptu farmer's market trip.'

The bike features rectangular handlebars that can be removed and used as a lock. This means that the bike can be secured to a railing in a number of ways, while cyclists do not need to carry around an extra security device.

There is an inbuilt-motor so that flagging riders can rely on electricity to help power them up steep hills – or along flat surfaces if they are feeling lazy.

Electric gears change automatically so that cyclists can maintain a steady speed, similar to  systems used by professional cyclists.

The battery also powers LED lights and is slim and light enough that it can be carried in a backpack for then it needs to be recharged.

The lights are automatically on so that people don't forget to turn them on when it grows dark and the rear light becomes stronger when a cyclist brakes.

The Denny also has indicators that are activated by flicking the left or right brake forward, PocketLint reported. 

Other little details make the bike easier to use on a daily basis, such as storage in the form of an elasticated net and mudguards with little brushes, which are designed to break up large water droplets to prevent them splashing a cyclist

The creators at Sizemore Bicycle claim: ‘Denny is the “all in” cycling solution that meets security, safety and importantly convenience needs.’

It will be available to buy next year via Fuji Bikes, although no price has yet been announced.
