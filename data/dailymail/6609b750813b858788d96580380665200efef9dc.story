Yo may have come from humble beginnings but the app once dubbed ‘pointless’ has much more ambitious plans.

Its San Francisco developers have launched the Yo Store designed to notify users of new articles, funny videos, tweets, sports scores and more.

And there are more than 150 services from the likes of Lonely Planet, the Premier League and Daily Mail.

Yo has launched the Yo Store designed to notify users of new articles, funny videos, tweets, sports scores and more There are more than 150 services from likes of Lonely Planet, the Premier League and Daily Mail. A website won’t spam users with a Yo, instead Yos are only sent when they reach a certain set of criteria

Yo initially launched on April Fool's Day last year and let people simply send the word 'Yo' to each other. 

Despite being decribed as essentially useless, the app raised £590,000 ($1 million) in funding within its first two months.

In August last year, the free iOS and Android app was updated to add Yo Link, Yo Index and hashtags.

The Index let users subscribe to custom-made Yo notification alerts and the Yo Store is an extension of this.

Services fall under 10 categories including Fun, News, Lifestyle, Social, Sports, Tech, Music, Productivity, Business, Travel.

Clicking a category on the Store - available from the app and on desktop browsers - shows the list of services and a brief description of each.

Clicking the Details button reveals more about the criteria for each notification and how they will appear. And users can choose to receive notifications from these services using the Subscribe button.

Yo initially launched on April Fool's Day last year and let people simply send the word 'Yo!' to each other. 

It subsequently raised £590,000 ($1 million) in funding in the first two months. 

It has added minor features ever since, including integration with Twitter, but the app received a major overhaul in August. 

Users can now choose to show their name and photo, and this photo can be viewed by swiping right on a username.

They can send links by pressing and holding a username as well as add hashtags.  

A list of trending hashtags is also available from the Yo site. 

‘From the magical Instagram star Lil Bub to the official NBA, get real-time important and fun updates from all your favourite stuff,’ explained the firm in a blog post.

‘We’re pleased to announce another big milestone here at Yo - the debut of the new Yo Store. With over 150 services on Yo, the platform had outgrown the original Yo Index, and we can’t wait for you to see what we came up with.’

Although the Store is similar to an RSS feed or news aggregator, the firm added that it focuses on quality rather than quantity.

A website won’t spam users with a Yo every time a story is posted, for example.

Instead, Yos are only sent when they reach a certain set of criteria.

As an example, people subscribing to the Chelseagoal service are only Yo’d when Chelsea scores.

Alternatively, when a tweet posted by the @BoredElonMusk Twitter handle is retweeted 100 times, the service will send a Yo.

There is also a Yo service for the Yo Team to update users of new services joining the Store. 

The service provider can choose what criteria a post needs to meet before sending a Yo, and the Yo team curates the Store to make sure no service bombards users with irrelevant push notifications. Additionally, individual users can create their own service and notifications using the Yo Dashboard

Additionally, individual users can create their own service and notifications using the Yo Dashboard.

It works in a similar way to web service IFTTT, which stands for ‘If This Then That’.

This service lets people automate tasks that rely on certain criteria and can be used on phones, in smart homes and on websites.

‘New services are joining Yo every week, and they’re all free,’ continued the firm.
