Vitor Pereira, the former manager of Porto, is the surprise name on the short-list for the vacant job at Crystal Palace.

Pereira, 46, was considered by Everton as a successor to David Moyes, before the appointment of Roberto Martinez. 

Now he is set for discussions with Crystal Palace owner Steve Parish, who sacked Neil Warnock on Saturday, following the 3-1 defeat at home to Southampton.

Former Porto boss Vitor Pereira is on the short-list to replace Neil Warnock at Crystal Palace

 Neil Warnock has left his post in charge of the Eagles after just 16 Premier League matches

In 76 matches as a Premier League manager, Neil Warnock has won 17, drawn 19 and lost 40. He has a win record of 22.4 per cent, and 70 points from a possible 228.

Parish will open talks with Pereira, although he is believed to be one of a number of candidates. Crystal Palace would not rule out a return for Tony Pulis – although their former manager would have to make the first move, unlikely given his comments on Saturday.

And there were rumours emanating from the north-east today that former player Alan Pardew could be a contender, although the £5m compensation clause in his contract would make a huge dent in Palace’s budget for the January transfer window.

Parish knows the appointment of Pereira would be a gamble, given his lack of Premier League experience. Aside from a recent spell at Al-Ahli in Saudi Arabia, his entire coaching career has been spent in Portugal, often at youth level or among backroom staff. He was assistant to Andre Villas-Boas at Porto, inheriting the job when he left to take over Chelsea in 2011.

Pereira then won back to back titles at Porto, but disappointed in Europe, and quit in summer 2013 after missing out on the Everton job. 

He spent a year in Saudi Arabia and was succeeded at Al-Ahli by Christian Gross.

Pereira is currently without a club, meaning he could start immediately, but Palace want time to consider other candidates and have already determined that Keith Millen will be in charge for the matches with Queens Park Rangers and Aston Villa.

The Eagles dropped into the bottom three of the Premier League on Boxing Day after a 3-1 loss to Southampton, with pressure mounting on Warnock and fans calling for his head.  

The club confirmed the sacking with a brief statement on their website. It said: 'Crystal Palace Football Club can today confirm that Neil Warnock has been relieved of his duties and is no longer first-team manager.

'The club would like to put on record its thanks to Neil for all his hard work and energy over the past four months.

'Keith Millen will lead the team against Queens Park Rangers tomorrow [Sunday] as caretaker manager.'

'We got on a bus and before we got to the hotel the driver said he had a message from his boss that he wouldn't take us to the ground unless I paid for the bus. That's the last time I was at Newcastle. I haven't got my money back for that bus by the way!' - Ahead of his first match back in charge of Palace, at Newcastle, Warnock recalls learning how the club had slipped into administration ahead of his last visit to St James' Park with the Eagles in 2010.

'I think that's why they threw the last goal in, so they didn't go to Man City away. We heard the score' - Warnock was frustrated after the Selhurst Park stadium announcer told fans the winner of their Capital One Cup match against Newcastle - still ongoing at the time - would face Manchester City, who were fresh off a 7-0 win over Sheffield Wednesday.

'I have not seen something like that since Bert Trautmann' - A furious Warnock condemns Craig Dawson's challenge on goalkeeper Julian Speroni during Palace's 2-2 draw with West Brom on October 25.

'I don't really know what a billionaire could do for Palace - I have only been here six weeks. You'd better ask the chairman. There are not a lot of billionaires in Yorkshire' - Warnock reacts to speculation linking American Josh Harris with a takeover of Palace.

'I am looking forward to going back on talkSPORT and BT after (finishing as a manager), when you can say what you want and enjoy it' - Warnock reacts to an improper conduct charge from the Football Association relating to his post-match comments after the 2-1 home defeat to Chelsea.

'I can't afford to keep giving my wife the same amount of money as the fine; it's a double whammy for me' - And Warnock later reveals he must also pay his wife the equivalent of any FA fine after being made to pay £9,000 for those post-match remarks.

'He doesn't know what he's going to do next, so the full-back doesn't have a chance, does he?' - Yannick Bolasie's unorthodox style earns his manager's praise.

'One of the press guys told me this morning that on Delaney's Instagram he says he's agreed (to sign a new contract) so somebody at the club will tell me eventually. Unfortunately Damien can't tweet me but no doubt he'll let me know. It's good news if it is true' - Warnock reacts to reports of a new contract for Damien Delaney.

'As long as they play well I'm sure managers don't care what they wear. I'm surprised at Christmas time that we haven't got a pair of boots with flashing lights!' - In one of his final Palace press conferences, Warnock has a new suggestion for football boot designers.

Speaking to the Croydon Advertiser, chairman Steve Parish revealed the reason behind the sacking, while admitting that it is a priority to start negotiations with a new manager immediately.

'We have let Neil go and we have thanked him for his work,' the Palace owner said. 'It's not working out and we are looking for a reaction against QPR.

'I slept on it really and just spoke to a few people and made my mind up this morning. Neil is a great guy and he wanted to do it at Palace. It just hasn't happened.

'It just wasn't working. You always want it sorted out as soon as possible but I haven't got anyone lined up. We want to hold negotiations as soon as possible.' 

Warnock has therefore become the first managerial casualty of the Premier League season, taking charge of just 16 league games in his second stint at Selhurst Park.

The substitution of winger Yannick Bolasie for full-back Martin Kelly, when Palace were 3-0 down to Southampton, saw fans call for Warnock's head on Boxing Day. 

Chants of 'you don't know what you're doing' rang around Selhurst Park, while sections of the home fans booed at the full-time whistle.

Warnock was honest in his assessment of the performance though, admitting that he expected a negative response from the Palace faithful. 

'I have no complaints, at 3-0 down, you'd be very surprised not to get a bit of stick. I thought the players were very good today in the circumstances, they were almost as shell-shocked as some of the fans.'

Caretaker boss Millen is now in a position familiar to him, after two previous stints as caretaker manager at Selhurst Park. After the departures of Ian Holloway and  Pulis, it was him whom Palace called upon to take the reigns, and so it is not a position alien to the 48-year-old.

'It is not a nice position to be in again, I must admit,' Millen told Sky Sports News. 'It was a surprise this morning.

'We have all been disappointed by yesterday's result but the first-half performance was decent. We're just not taking our chances at the moment, so we've come into work this morning and I get the phone call from the chairman.

'It has been a shock for us all, but we have got to try and be professional and try and concentrate on a massive game tomorrow [Sunday].'

The Eagles face a tough trip to Loftus Road, where they take on relegation rivals QPR in what would have been a return to his old club for Warnock. 

'Neil came in this morning and we had a quick chat,' Millen continued. 'He cleared his desk and his stuff.

'It is always a sad time and it is very difficult for all of us, the staff, because he kept us here and we were part of his backroom staff.

'We're all disappointed but we have got to move on very quickly with this big game.'
