A killer cannibal who ate his victim alive went crazy after going on a massive drugs binge when released from prison it has emerged. 

Eye-witnesses claim that Matthew Williams, 34, took a huge cocktail of mind-bending drugs including miaow miaow just before the savage attack.

Williams told friends he was hearing voices and hallucinating before attacking Cerys Yemm, 22, biting off parts of her face. 

Following Thursday's murder, the Ministry of Justice has announced that they will launch an investigation into the murder.

Williams had earlier complained of suffering hallucinations and seeing everything in negative due to his drugs binge before he invited Ms Yemm back to his room in the Sirhowy Arms Hotel in  Caerphilly, south Wales 

Williams visited a house along with a friend and his victim where it is claimed he drank heavily, smoked cannabis and injected Mkat. 

Williams then started showing signs of psychotic behaviour saying everything looked like a negative photograph.

But the man, a key police witness, has told investigating officers he had no reason to believe Williams would kill Ms Yemm in his room at the Sirhowy Arms Hotel in the village of Argoed, near Blackwood, South Wales.

Williams had previous convictions for violence and drugs and Ms Yemm's heartbroken family are demanding to know why he wasn't being properly supervised.

The key witness said: 'Williams had just met Cerys and we all went to a friend's house for the evening.

The witness said: 'He had an ounce of miaow miaow on him and at some stage during the night he injected himself.

'He was also taking large quantities of prescription beta blockers given to him to help overcome his drugs habit.

'He said they were given to him when he was released from prison a couple of weeks ago.

'He seemed ok but he said he'd been hearing voices and seeing things like they were in negative.

'We were in the house until 11.30 - Cerys was there the whole time but she wasn't involved in any of the drug taking.

'They left together and Williams said he would take her back to his hotel where he would call a taxi to get her home.'

But Williams, who had convictions for violence, enticed her into his room at the nine-bedroomed hotel even though he was banned from having woman guests. 

Friends of the shopworker said she was chatted up in a pub by Williams before he invited her back to the hotel

Ms Yemm was heard screaming in the early hours and security staff at the hotel which operates as a bail hostel for offenders, burst into the room.

They saw Williams eating her face in what was described as a 'Hannibal Lecter' style act of cannibalism and police were called.

A lone woman police officer was yesterday hailed a heroine for stopping the cannibal killer by shooting him with a Taser.

The female officer was first on the scene and found Williams crouched over Ms Yemm's bloodied body eating her face.

She ordered him to step away from his victim - when he refused she discharged the high voltage stun gun bringing the attack to an end.

Williams was arrested but died minutes later and his victim was also declared dead the the scene.

The brave unnamed woman officer has been relived of her duties and is getting special counselling because of the scene she witnessed. 

A police insider said: 'She was the nearest officer to the crime scene when the 999 call came through.

'She was first on the scene and followed her training by warning the suspect her was about to be tasered.

'Other officers were there within minutes but she had to face an incredibly gruesome scene and then respond in a professional way.

'She is getting all the support she needs from the force.'

A post-mortem is being carried out to discover if Williams died of the electric shock from the Taser or if there were other factors.

Gwent Police have searched the house in Blackwood where Ms Yemm spent her final few hours before the attack.

Williams had not been subject to a Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangement which is used to manage violent offenders when they are freed. 

He had previously been released from prison after serving half of his sentence but he was sent back to jail after breaching the conditions of his licence.

A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: 'If a further offence is committed within a 30 day period from the sentence end date, a serious further offence review will take place.'

Gwent Police are currently conducting a murder investigation while the Independent Police Complaints Commission are probing Williams death.

Post-mortems are currently being carried out on Williams and his victim in order to determine how they died.

Friends in the nearby town of Blackwood said Williams was a known drug user and often injected drugs after drinking excessive alcohol and taking pills.

He had been living at the Sirhowy Arms Hotel serves as a temporary home for offenders who have recently been released from prison.

Gwent AM William Graham said: 'Reports around the recent release of Williams from prison - and an apparent lack of monitoring - are hugely worrying.

'If true, a wider inquiry into the circumstances surrounding his release is urgently required.

'It is now clear that Mr Williams posed a risk to the public and I am extremely concerned that monitoring appears to have been deemed unnecessary.

'Questions must be answered by authorities and a full explanation provided on the decisions taken in this extremely tragic case."

Ms Yemm was a student at Coleg Gwent between 2008 and April 2009, studying a First Diploma in health and social care, and staff were saddened to hear the news of her death.

Principal Jim Bennett said: 'Cerys left the college five years ago. It is always an extremely upsetting experience to learn of the loss of a former student. We would like to send our deepest sympathy and condolences to Cerys' family, friends and loved ones.'

She used to work at father Dean's pub in Abercarn, the New Inn and then worked at the Next clothing store in Newport Retail Park where she was described as 'a very popular member of her team'. 

Shelly Davies, a friend of Miss Yemm, said: 'I just keep thinking of how frightening and painful it would have been for her

'I feel sick to my stomach, it's horrific to think that one person can inflict some much brutality onto another.

'I had bad dreams all night and I feel exhausted.'

Another friend, Kathy Young, said: 'My thoughts are with her family.

'No one should have to go through this, this is horror movie stuff. Not happening in your hometown.'

Miss Yemm had been a pupil at Oakdale Comprehensive School and had studied Health and Social Care at Crosskeys College.

One businessman in the former mining village of Oakdale said: 'Everyone here knew Cerys - we watched her growing up.

'She was a lovely girl, smart, attractive and brought up by a very good family who she was extremely close to.

'They're nice people - they must be going through hell.'

A neighbour added: 'I can't bring myself to think about what happened to her, she was so nice, she would always say hello.'

Miss Yemm had seen her own former boyfriend Mathew Hayman jailed after breaking up with him in October last year.

Hayman, then 27, tried to kill himself after they split by setting his house on fire.

He lit up his bathroom before turning on the gas cooker - and it was 'pure chance' his house in Abertillery did not explode.

Hayman admitted arson when he appeared at Newport Crown Court and was jailed for three and a half years.
