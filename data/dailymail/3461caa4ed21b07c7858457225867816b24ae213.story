A man has admitted killing the businessman cousin of Sir Ranulph Fiennes by stabbing him three times with a pair of scissors at a tapas bar.

Nicholas Hunter was heard saying, 'The world is going to end tonight at midnight,' before he launched a random attack on James Fiennes.

He  pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility after psychiatrists agreed he was mentally ill at the time of the attack in April last year, and was sentenced to be detained indefinitely.

Mr Fiennes, 49, was an IT consultant and entrepreneur who was the second cousin of explorer Sir Ranulph and a distant relative of actors Ralph and Joseph Fiennes.

The Old Bailey heard that on the evening of his death he had gone for a drink at The Tapestry tapas bar in Mortlake, south-west London, near the flat where he spent half of each week.

He was a regular at the bar, and was described by staff and customers as a 'quiet, polite, kind and generous man', said prosecutor Zoe Johnson QC.

She told the court that Hunter, 37, was working for an engineering company in Barnes run by his friend Thomas Olsen.

His family have a 'genetic vulnerability' to mental illness and his maternal grandfather, his nephew and his brother have all been affected, Ms Johnson said.

Investigation: A police officer outside the bar shortly after the tragic incident last year

In 2005 he moved with his wife to Hong Kong to work for Cathay Pacific, but in 2011 he resigned and returned to Britain after being diagnosed with depression and prescribed anti-psychotic drugs.

After his baby son was born in February 2014 Hunter reported feeling paranoid, suspicious and losing touch with reality, said Ms Johnson.

'He believed people were talking about him, following him and were going to kill him,' she added.

On the day of the attack, Hunter bought a a pair of scissors from Sainsbury's during his lunch break and after work he went to Mr Olsen's home and suggested going for a drink.

Shortly after he arrived at the bar he announced 'out of the blue' to Mr Olsen, 'I'm going to have a sex change', then added: 'I shouldn't have told you that, I'm going to kill you, the world is going to end at midnight tonight.'

Hunter then appeared to notice Mr Fiennes and called out 'Hi James', even though he had not met the victim previously.

Mr Fiennes approached him and asked how they knew each other, but Hunter just said: 'James, I'm going to have to kill you.'

The attacker pulled out his scissors and stabbed Mr Fiennes repeatedly in a 'frenzied and unprovoked' attack, the court heard, before guests tackled him to the ground.

Mr Olsen said the 'vicious' attack made it look 'as if he was possessed', the court was told.

Mr Fiennes was rushed to hospital for emergency treatment but died five hours later after his wife Caroline and their two children rushed to London from the family home in Sherborne, Dorset.

Hunter, originally from Uddingston in Lanarkshire, said 'I have really f***ed up my life' after dropping the scissors in the bar.

He later told investigators he did not know why he had killed Mr Fiennes, but said it had something to do with the end of the world.

The killer was also unable to explain why he had greeted his victim by name, saying he had 'a complete explosion in his mind'.

Hunter pleaded not guilty to murdering and threatening to kill Mr Olsen, but the Crown agreed to let the charges lie on file after he admitted manslaughter.

Miss Johnson said: 'The psychiatrists are agreed that at the time the defendant was suffering from an abnormality of mental functioning, namely schizo-affective disorder.'

In a victim impact statement, Mrs Fiennes said: 'The day I met James I knew I would marry him. I loved him then, I love him now and I will love him forever.

'He was my best friend, my soulmate, my rock or oak tree. Everything a good husband could be, James was.

'He was kind, considerate, funny, gentle, spiritual and intelligent. Above all he was loving. Everyone and anyone who knew James described him as a gentleman in every sense of the world.'

In a statement read out by his barrister Isabella Forshall QC, Hunter said: 'Words alone cannot express the sorrow I feel for the catastrophic situation I have caused to those affected. I think of them and I pray for them.

'I am so very sorry for the tragedy my actions have caused.'

Miss Forshall said: 'If this man hadn't become mentally ill he would have continued to live a conscientious, thoughtful and valuable life.'

Sentencing Hunter to be detained indefinitely in a secure hospital, judge Gerald Gordon said: 'After careful consideration I have come to the conclusion that your responsibility for what you did at the time by reason of your mental illness was so substantially reduced and caused by your mental health that that is the right course.

'I should stress that I have taken into account both the ferocity of the attack and that the person you attacked was a total stranger.

'This was indeed a serious, unprovoked attack upon a complete stranger resulting in his loss of life. It occurred without your having any violent history whatsoever and as a result of your mental illness.

'I am satisfied that in the circumstances that if you are ever released, unless it is with the most careful control and monitoring, that there is a real risk of serious harm were there to be any future relapse.'
