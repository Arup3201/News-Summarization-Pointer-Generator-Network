A Southern California couple who scaled back watering due to drought 
received a letter from the city of Glendora warning that they could face
 fines if they don't get their brown lawn green again.

The San Gabriel Valley Tribune reports the letter from the code enforcement bureau says the dry grass could 
be a 'potential public nuisance problem.'

Michael Korte and his wife 
Laura Whitney are told if they don't revive the lawn they could be hit 
with up to $500 in fines and possible criminal action.

Southern California couple Laura Whitney and husban Michael Korte, who scaled back watering due to drought, received a letter from the city of Glendora warning that they could face fines if they don't get their brown lawn green again

On Tuesday — when the couple received the letter — state regulators authorized fines up to $500 for overwatering lawns.

'Despite the
 water conservation efforts, we wish to remind you that limited watering
 is still required to keep landscaping looking healthy and green,' the letter stated.

It included pictures of the dead lawn with a red line through it, a weedy line similarly crossed out, and finally an uncrossed green lawn with a sprinkler.

'It is telling me I’d better get my lawn green and I have 60 days to do it,' Laura said.

Ironically, on the same day the couple received the letter the State Water Resources Control Board gave local agencies power to fine for overwatering lawns to help reduce water consumption as the state is in the third year of record low rainfall.

Should the couple wish to improve their lawn they'll likely have to water it every day.

'It
 seems like you’ll be fined if you overwater but we will be fined no 
matter what,' Laura said.

City Manager Chris Jeffers says the couple has not been cited and called it a friendly letter prompted by a neighbor's complaint

If worse comes to worse, the couple will completely re-seed their lawn with grass that requires less water

If worse comes to worse, Laura says the couple will completely re-seed their lawn with grass that requires less water.

The city manager Chris Jeffers says the letter was simply a friendly reminder due to a neighbor's complaint.

'We
 are consistently telling people conserve,' Jeffers said. 'But I don’t think the state is saying we have to have dirt 
or unlandscaped property. You have to make a community appearance so 
property values don’t plummet.'
