China has dismissed 'groundless' claims it was behind a hacking attack which resulted in data from up to 80 million customers being stolen from US health insurance giant Anthem.

The company revealed it suspected information belonging to tens of millions of current and former customers, as well as employees, has been stolen in the cyber attack.

Sources close to the investigation are reported to have said the breach bore the hallmarks of previous attacks blamed on Chinese hackers.

Under attack: US health insurance giant Anthem was hacked with data of 80m Americans stolen

Hong Lei, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry,  told a briefing in Beijing that America should not be making allegations.

'The US side should not make groundless accusations against China,' he said.

'It is unreasonable to make an accusation without enough evidence.'

The cyber attack is the latest where US investigators say evidence points to China. In October, James Comey, the FBI director, said it was at the 'top of the list' of countries launching cyberattacks on US firms.

'It is very difficult to determine the source of hacking activities, especially when it is carried out across borders,' Hong said. 

Last year, five members of a Chinese army hacking team known as Unit 61398 were indicted by US federal prosecutors on charges of stealing information from companies, including nuclear plant manufacturer Westinghouse, SolarWorld and US Steel.

The information stolen from Anthem includes names, birth dates, social security numbers, street addresses, email addresses and employment information, the company said.

President Barack Obama's cybersecurity adviser, Michael Daniel, speaking at a seminar in Washington, called the data breach 'quite concerning' and warned consumers to change their passwords and monitor their credit scores. 

Attorneys general of Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, Arkansas and North Carolina are now looking into the breach, according to representatives of their offices and internal documents. California's Department of Insurance said it will review Anthem's response to the data attack.

Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen asked Anthem Chief Executive Joseph Swedish to provide  detailed information about the cyberattack, the company's security practices and privacy policies by March 4, according to a letter obtained by Reuters.

'We hope and expect to work in close coordination with other attorneys general,' said Jaclyn Falkowski, a spokeswoman for Jepsen.

Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal reported that while the investigation into the attack was in its early stages, there were indications it could be part of a broader spying campaign rather than profit-driven identity theft.

With details about a person's medical records, for example, cyber spies could craft emails that appeared legitimate to business or government agency workers but were rigged with malicious software to gain access to their employers' computers networks.
