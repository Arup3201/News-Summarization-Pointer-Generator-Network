Callum McGregor will cap a stunning start to his first-team career at Celtic with a promotion to the Scotland squad for next month’s clash with world champions Germany.

The 21-year-old has won a rapid promotion from Billy Stark’s Under 21s after four goals in his first seven games for the Parkhead club.

Three of his strikes have come in European away games in Reykjavik, Warsaw and Maribor, taking Ronny Deila’s side to within 90 minutes of the Champions League group stage.

And the midfielder, praised highly by new Celtic boss Ronny Deila last week, will win his reward when Gordon Strachan’s names his squad for the first qualifying game of the Euro 2016 campaign in Dortmund on Monday morning.

Meanwhile, McGregor wants the Scottish champions to harness the power of Parkhead against Maribor in their Champions League play-off on Tuesday night.

Deila’s men are on the brink of maximising their reprieve and landing a £15million group stage jackpot after McGregor’s goal earned a 1-1 first-leg draw last week away from home.

The decisive return match will be the first European outing for Celtic in their home stadium this season, as its use in the Commonwealth Games forced a switch to Murrayfield for previous rounds.

And McGregor believes an intense atmosphere inside Parkhead – which has four times the capacity of Maribor’s ground – can play a crucial role in unsettling the visitors.

‘The games at Murrayfield had a lot of people there, about 40,000, but it’s still not the same as playing at Celtic Park,’ said the 21-year-old. ‘The crowd gets going on a European night and that puts a wee bit pressure on the away team.

‘Maybe they (Maribor) are not so used to playing in front of big crowds like that. Hopefully we can get the crowd going and spook them a little bit - and get at them right from the start.’

While fully appreciative of the positive impact of playing on home turf, McGregor believes it also important Celtic don’t adopt a gung-ho attitude and leave themselves too open.

Maribor were content to hit on the break in their home leg and look certain to adopt a similar approach in Glasgow.

Deila attempted to ensure key players were rested ahead of the potentially season-defining game by making 10 changes for Saturday’s trip to Inverness.

Yet the move came at a cost as a shadow side slipped to a 1-0 defeat against the early Premiership pacesetters.

‘The boys are not under any impression that the job is finished against Maribor,’ insisted McGregor, who came on as a second-half substitute against Inverness.

‘We know exactly what we have to do to get the result. All the energy will go into that.

‘We dominated possession in the first half over there but you are always susceptible to the counter attack. We know what we have to do.

‘We will have a lot of the ball and the fans will be on our side as well. We just have to be careful we don’t get caught the other side by throwing too many bodies forward at the one time.

‘We have to play the game and not listen to the crowd too much. They will be really eager for us to go and attack but we have to get a good balance in the team and attack at the right times. I’m sure we’ll be ready for it.’
