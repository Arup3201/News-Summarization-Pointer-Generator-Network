Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber and Ben Stiller were among the celebrities at Madison Square Garden on Wednesday night as the New York Knicks were beaten 104-80 by the Chicago Bulls on NBA opening night.

Singer-songwriter Swift, who spent the day promoting her new pop crossover album 1989 and is preparing to jet off on a world tour, brought along glamorous supermodel friend Karlie Kloss to the big game.

The former country star's latest album came out on Sunday and has received rave reviews as it soared to the top of the charts.

Pop sensation Bieber sat further back and wore a Pharrell Williams-style fedora hat through out the game.

And it appears the 20-year-old had a more spiritual time than most at the game as he spent most of the time chatting to the iconic civil rights leader Reverend Jesse Jackson.

On the court, Pau Gasol racked up 21 points and 11 rebounds on his Bulls debut and Derrick Rose scored 13 points after missing most of the last two seasons as Derek Fisher's first game as an NBA coach ended in defeat.

Reserve Taj Gibson finished with 22 points to lead the Bulls who, with a wealth of frontcourt depth, didn't even need a big night from Rose. The former MVP took only seven shots and had five assists in 21 minutes in a game Chicago led by as much as 35.

Rose missed the 2012-13 season after tearing his left Acute Cruciate Ligament in the 2012 play-offs. He returned last season and hit the go-ahead shot to beat the Knicks on Halloween in Chicago's home opener, but was lost again for the season when he tore cartilage in the other knee in November.

Carmelo Anthony scored 14 points for the Knicks, who won't have it any easier in the second half of their season-opening back-to-back. They visit the Cavaliers, the other Eastern Conference favourite, on Thursday in the first game since LeBron James returned to Cleveland. 

Derrick Rose showed he has put his injury woes behind him by scoring 13 points on the night
