A single mother living in Silicon Valley has told how she's been forced to move into a single garage measuring around 250-square-feet as rent continues to skyrocket.

Nicole Jones now pays $1,000 per month - around one-fourth of the average San Francisco rent  - to live in the tiny space with her 18-month-old daughter and she also has a son on the way.

The converted home in suburban  San Mateo includes a central space which is utilized as a living room, kitchen, bedroom and dining room. In the back, there is a toilet and stand-up shower.

'There's no playing sports or little soccer games down the hallway, because this is it. What you see is what you get,' Jones half-jokingly told CNN.

Home, sweet home: A single mother living in Silicon Valley has told how she's been forced to move into a single garage measuring around 250-square-feet as rent continues to skyrocket

Temporary solution: Nicole Jones now pays $1,000 per month - around one-fourth of the average San Francisco rent - to live in the tiny space with her 18-month-old daughter and she also has a son on the way

Using the space: The converted home in suburban San Mateo includes a central space which is utilized as a living room, kitchen, bedroom and dining room. In the back, there is a toilet and stand-up shower

Sadness: 'There's no playing sports or little soccer games down the hallway, because this is it. What you see is what you get,' Jones half-jokingly told CNN

She explained that she used to live in a normal apartment but was forced to downgrade after losing her job.

The Californian has since found employment, but with rental prices continuing to creep up, she has decided to stay put for now.

In a bid to make the garage cosy she has installed a gas fire and dark wood flooring.

A microwave grill perches on top of a clothes cabinet, and a stroller sits next to the television. 

Jones' bed doubles up as a couch.

The other downside to Jones' abode, along with the lack of space, is that there is no easy way to get inside.

Each time she enters, she must crane up the entire garage front door, with all of her possessions on show.

Although, she is still paying a substantial amount of rent, Jones compares herself to a homeless person. 

Cramped: Jones' garage includes a small toilet space with cleaning products tucked into alcoves

Rub-a-dub-dub: There is also a stand-up shower but no bathtub - Jones says the wash area is 'very small'

Frugal living: Jones adds that along with rent she has to fork out for transportation and daycare which leaves her with little spare at the end of the month

'I didn't know much about homelessness before,' she said. 

'Honestly, I thought homeless people were panhandlers or people on the street that were hungry and cold and drug addicts and alcoholics who didn't want to do anything for themselves.'

Jones adds that along with rent she has to fork out for transportation and daycare which leaves her with little spare at the end of the month.

Touching on the birth of her second child, she added: 'I am nervous, excited, frightened, sad.'

The expectant mother remains hopeful of finding a more manageable living situation.

The average property rent in San Mateo is now $3,608, according to the real estate firm Zillow.com. 

It jumped a staggering 14.9per cent from 2014 to 2015.
