A Massachusetts skydiver plummeted to his death Sunday morning when his parachute failed to slow his free fall.

Daniel Pelrine, a 37-year-old an experienced jumper, was discovered dead by authorities around 11am from what was hauntingly deemed 'blunt trauma from the ground.'

Now investigators must sort out whether Pelrine's equipment malfunctioned and why the tragedy occurred even though the parachute was open when he smashed into the ground.

Tragedy: An experienced skydiver plummeted to his death Sunday morning and now authorities are investigating whether his equipment malfunctioned

Medics pronounced the Boston resident dead at the scene, according to WCVB.

He was a resident of the Mattapan neighborhood.

The Federal Aviation Administration and Pepperell police are investigating.

Perline's death, while tragic, is a rare outcome from what--statistically speaking--is a relatively safe sport.

Each year, about 3 million decide to take the plunge.

Perline leaped from the plane at Skydive Pepperell Center in Massachusetts. His parachute was open at the time of impact

In 2013, 3.2 million people leaped from planes. Twenty-four of them died.

That means, on average, about .0075 of every 1000 jumps proves fatal according to the United States Parachute Association.

Just last month, a New York City correctional officer died in Long Island when, investigators believe, a 'mini tornado' caused his and his instructor's parachute to malfunction.

The instructor was hospitalized in critical condition.
