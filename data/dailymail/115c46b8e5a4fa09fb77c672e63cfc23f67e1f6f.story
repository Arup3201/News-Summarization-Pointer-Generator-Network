A miracle mother has amazingly survived four heart attacks and a stroke as she gave birth to twins.

George Cormack, 33, almost died after having her first baby Oscar when her heart stopped and she suffered a bilateral stroke.  

Her second baby, Connie, was not breathing when she was delivered but was brought back to life by doctors at Colchester General Hospital, Essex.

Mrs Cormack had suffered an amniotic fluid embolism - a rare deadly condition which about about one in 20,000 pregnant women.

Fluid which surrounds the baby or other debris enters the mother's blood stream via the womb and triggers an allergic reaction.

The mother-of-two said: 'When I should have been 
celebrating the happiest event of my life I was at a loss to know who I 
was, where I was, what I was doing there.

'I was unable to understand all these strange noises people around me were making.'

She was placed in an induced coma to help her body recover and then faced a three-month battle to learn how to speak and walk again with the help of language therapist Alison Wren.

Now, 10-months after her ordeal began, she is able to enjoy life with her baby twins back at home in Great Tey, Essex.

'It's been traumatic and I've been through every emotion imaginable these past 10 months. But more than anything else I feel lucky,' insisted George.

'Lucky that I am here to tell the 
tale and so fortunate to have had Alison, my speech therapist, and her 
colleagues helping me every inch of the way.

'I cannot begin to stress how much work they have put into helping me recover. They are incredible unsung heroes.'

George described her long, gruelling recovery as waking up very slowly. She had to go back to primary school basics, learning the alphabet and object recognition.

Mrs Wren said: 'I would set George a week's worth of therapy and she would have it done in a day.

'I've never known anyone so determined. I found it totally inspirational.'

She added: 'It was one of the most severe strokes I have come across and for her to come back from that position to where she is today is quite amazing.'

Mrs Cormack said: 'Without the help of a lot of people, I wouldn't be telling this story now.

'The consultant who saved my life, and my babies, whilst working with the crash team, the theatre staff, the midwives, the special care baby unit staff, the critical care unit who nursed me back to consciousness, the stroke unit and the neuro rehab teams.'

Mrs Cormack has settled back home with her husband Sean and is looking forward to going back to work in social care in the future.
