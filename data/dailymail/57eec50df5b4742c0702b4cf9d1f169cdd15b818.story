A grandmother is facing criminal charges after the death of her grandson who was left alone in a sweltering car.

Leslie McDonald, 51, was charged on Friday in Ontario, Canada with criminal negligence in connection with the death of one-year-old Maximus Huyskens.

Police
 say the boy died on June 26, a month short of his second birthday, 
after being exposed to temperatures of up to 90F for an extended period of
 time outside a home in Milton.

Tragedy: Maximus Huyskens died in June, a month before his second birthday, after he was left in a car in 90F heat

Devastating: The one-year-old's tiny white coffin is carried into the church

The boy was in the care of his maternal
 grandmother, who is deaf, while his father was at work and his mother was at an 
appointment, police said.

Maximus was due to turn two on July 29. His funeral was held on July 3 after he died of heatstroke.

His
 grandmother faces life in prison if found guilty. It is unclear if 
McDonald being deaf played a role in the child's death, inquisitr.com reported.

The 51-year-old was charged after police investigated for a week and spoke to various witnesses.

Maximus
 Marcus Aurelius Huyskens was born on July 29, 2011 to parents Marcus 
and Tamara. He is also survived by his brother Nico and sister Leilah.

According to website KidsandCars.org, 33 
children were killed in the U.S. when they were left in hot cars in 
2011 - down from 49 in the previous year.

Inquisitr
 also reported that a three-year-old girl had died in Edmonton, Canada 
last week but no one was charged over her death as she had not been left
 in the unlocked car by an adult.

Distraught: Mourners cling to each other as many wept following the baby's funeral in Ontario, Canada

An eight-month-old boy in Virginia died on July 5 after being left in a car all day by his mother in temperatures reaching 90F.

The woman told police she had forgotten her child was in the car when she drove to work in Arlington last Friday.

When she left work that afternoon she discovered her son in the car and drove him to INOVA Alexandria Hospital around 4pm, according to NBCWashington.

The child was pronounced dead at the hospital.

A similar tragedy happened on the same day in Baltimore where a 16-month-old girl died when a relative forgot her in his truck when he went to take a nap.

He was meant to drop the child off at daycare but drove home instead.

Four hours later he got into his vehicle and drove to the Head Start centre to pick up the girl, but when he was told the child had not been dropped off, he discovered her unresponsive in his truck.

She was pronounced dead at the hospital.

The table shows non-traffic fatalities amongst children and shows that there were 613 heat-related deaths between 1991 and 2011
