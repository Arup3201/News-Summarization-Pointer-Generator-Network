This is the magical moment a Laguna Beach paddle-boarder came within touching distance of a gentle Orca whale pod in California.

Rich German shot the video off Laguna Beach on his GoPro camera, giving a stunning bird eyes view of his experience.  

He said: 'I always had this dream, and that was to see orcas and that dream came true a few days ago.'

Boats: German paddles out and spots a group of boats in the area who appear to be gazing at something

Amazing: The serene video shows the moment he spots the orcas on his GoPro camera

German uploaded the serene video to YouTube, which, at the time of writing, has over 200,000 views.

He has dozens of videos of himself interacting with various species of dolphin and whales to the video-sharing website. But said he always hoped he'd get footage of Orcas.

Last week, he paddled out to see if he could catch up with a pod of orcas on their way out of Long Beach.

He soon realized he was in luck.

'I'd heard just a day before that there was a small pod of orcas just off the shore of Long Beach and they were heading south,' he said. 

He then spots a group of boats in the area who appear to be gazing at something in the water. 

Interaction: Five stunning orcas spot him, swim past, spray water and swim under his board.

Close encounter: One nearly knocks him off at one point but German said: 'I was too excited to be scared'

Swimming away: German is hoping the video will help raise awareness about orcas, whose population is dwindling

He said: 'I took a shot that that might be them, and to my great delight and amazement, it was.'

Soon, five stunning orcas spot him, swim past, spray water and swim under his board.

One nearly knocks him off at one point but German said: 'I was too excited to be scared.'

He is hoping the video will help raise awareness  about orcas, whose population is dwindling.

'Their populations are decreasing, and you probably have heard a lot of things that have gone on with them in captivity,' he adds.
