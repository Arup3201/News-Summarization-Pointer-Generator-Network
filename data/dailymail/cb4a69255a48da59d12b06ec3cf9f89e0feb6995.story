Breaking silence: Edward Snowden gave his first interviews since seeking asylum in Russia last August in an story published by the Washington Post Monday night

Six months after being forced to seek asylum in Russia, NSA whistle-blower Edward Snowden is content with the work he's done to expose how the U.S. government was spying on its own people.

He told the Washington Post in his first interview since arriving in Moscow that his 'mission's already accomplished'.

'I already won. As soon as the journalists were able to work, everything that I had been trying to do was validated,' he said.

Snowden explained that he wasn't out to change society by releasing secrets on the NSA's wiretapping programs. He just wanted the public to have the information necessary to make a decision on whether they were comfortable with such wide-reaching intelligence gathering. 

This greater good has come at a huge personal cost to Snowden, as a target appeared on his back the moment the first articles were published using his leaked information last May.

By then, Snowden was already out of the country in Hong Kong, but he soon outstayed his welcome there.

En route to Latin America, the U.S. cancelled his passport and he was stuck in limbo in the Moscow airport.

President Vladimir Putin eventually agreed to give Snowden a temporary asylum in the country last August, but Snowden still seems uneasy in his current home.

During his two days of interviews with the Post, the reporter notes that the 'ascetic' never goes outside once.

Snowden says he lives off ramen noodles and chips and spends most of his hours on the internet keeping up on the progress of his cause back in the states.

No longer the company man: Snowden became unwelcome in his own country last spring when he supplied journalists with information on how the NSA (headquarters pictured above) spies on American citizens

'It has always been really difficult to get me to leave the house,' he said. 'I just don't have a lot of needs...Occasionally there's things to go do, things to go see, people to meet, tasks to accomplish, But it's really got to be goal-oriented, you know. Otherwise, as long as I can sit down and think and write and talk to somebody, that's more meaningful to me than going out and looking at landmarks.'

Snowden is believed to still have a cache of NSA documents in his possession, making him an uncomfortable Russian resident for the Obama administration.

The administration has been staunchly against granting Snowden asylum in exchange for him not releasing the rest of the documents, saying they intend to prosecute him if he ever returns to the country.

But that's not an opinion universally held. Rick Ledgett, the NSA's incoming deputy director, told 60 Minutes that Snowden is estimated to be in the possession of 1.7million documents and that he would favor giving the whistleblower amnesty to get those secrets back.

Not welcome: Susan Rice, national security adviser to President Obama, says she is against granting amnesty to Snowden

Friendly chat: Snowden speaks with ex-U.S. intelligence officers in Russia last October

There are already rumors that Snowden may have already brokered the documents over to the Chinese or Putin - his current protector.

But Snowden denies such allegations saying the documents were secured in a safe place, and that he doesn't even have any of the information on his laptop's hard drive or in Russia at all.

'There is no evidence at all for the claim that I have loyalties to Russia or China or any country other than the United States,' he said. 'I have no relationship with the Russian government. I have not entered into any agreements with them.'

'If I defected at all,' Snowden said. 'I defected to the public.'
