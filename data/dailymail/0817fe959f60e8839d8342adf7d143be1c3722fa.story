Judge Tim Devas claimed the Government should change rules surrounding the compulsory victim surcharge that was introduced in 2007 (file picture)

A judge ordered a serial thief to pay £1 compensation for his ‘very mean’ crime – and then fished in his pocket and handed over the cash himself.

District Judge Tim Devas  passed the £1 coin to a surprised court clerk to clear the penniless defendant’s debt.

Then, after condemning rules that require courts to impose compensation orders on criminals irrespective of their financial circumstances, he joked: ‘My chances of getting a knighthood are pretty slim anyway.’

Judge Devas was presiding over the case of a homeless thief who stole two letters from the Christmas post in a hunt for cash.

Daniel Northridge, 20, was of ‘limited means’ and had no meaningful family support, the court heard.

‘The sooner the Government changes it [the compensation rule] the better,’ he said, handing over the £1 coin at Mansfield Magistrates’ Court.

The judge, who has a history of making outspoken comments in court, then asked: ‘There’s no one here from the Press is there?’

It was when he learned there was a reporter from the local paper in court that he joked about a knighthood.

Yesterday he was criticised by a crime victims’ organisation for ordering such a low and ‘insensitive’ sum.

Northridge, of Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, admitted two counts of theft in what should have been a routine case.

Prosecutor Robert Carr told the court 
he stole two letters on December 19 from a shared mailbox in his block 
of flats. He was spotted on CCTV. He had previous convictions for theft 
and burglary and was automatically recalled to custody for 28 days.

Having served this time, he reappeared in court to be sentenced for the mailbox thefts.

He is believed to have been staying in emergency accommodation for the homeless.

Judge Devas handed him a six-month community order and ordered him to pay the £1.

The judge told the court: ‘Particularly at that time of year, this was a very mean offence.’

A spokesman for the Ministry of 
Justice said the district judge’s comments referred to Victim Surcharge 
payments which courts must now impose on defendants given specific 
sentences. Usually, one who has received a community sentence will pay 
£60.

After the hearing, Javed Khan of the 
charity Victim Support, said: ‘A £1 compensation order is simply 
insensitive. Regardless of the amount, offenders should be held 
personally accountable for paying compensation orders.’
