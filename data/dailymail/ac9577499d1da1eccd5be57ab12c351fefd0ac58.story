Doctors are being told to stop giving aspirin to patients who have a common heart condition that carries a high risk of stroke – as the drug doesn’t work.

But there are fears many GPs will still prescribe it for the condition, because they will continue to be paid to do so.

Doctors are funded for prescribing aspirin to patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), a type of irregular heartbeat, until April 2015.

AF sufferer Cyril Barnes, 65, a 
postmaster from Gloucestershire, has already moved on to warfarin – 
though a hospital cardiologist prescribed him aspirin and beta-blockers 
after a prolonged attack

Only then will the NHS payment rules change.

The decision will mean that 300,000 people currently prescribed aspirin for AF will have to be put on other blood-thinning drugs, including newer more expensive medicines.

Cardiologist Professor Martin Cowie, of Imperial College London, said last night: ‘This is a seismic shift in the guidelines and will have a huge impact on practice.

‘There are a great many patients with atrial fibrillation who are taking aspirin to prevent stroke and thinking it is doing a great job. It is not.

‘They need to go and see their doctor to discuss all the effective alternatives available.’

Millions of people across Britain take an aspirin a day believing it will reduce their risk of stroke, heart attack or cancer.

The pill has been handed out for years to people with AF, which raises the risk of stroke fivefold. It affects up to 1.2 million in Britain.

The decision to restrict its use has been taken by a review panel at the National Institute  for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), which publishes guidelines on NHS drugs.

The panel said that while aspirin might cut the risk of blood clot-induced strokes a little, that benefit  is all but cancelled out by  the increased risk of intestinal bleeding and ‘brain-bleed’ strokes.

The Nice guidance concludes: ‘Do not offer aspirin monotherapy solely for stroke prevention to patients with AF.’

Despite the concerns about the continued prescribing of aspirin for AF, Jo Jerrome, the deputy chief executive of the Atrial Fibrillation Association, said that the charity was ‘over the moon’ about the recommendation, set to be published on June 18.

She added: ‘This gives clinicians and patients a mandate  to assess patients using the best tools, knowing the options for treatment that will protect them.’

She urged people with AF not to stop taking aspirin before seeing their GP, as they might also have been prescribed it for another valid reason.

The recommendation will see more people being put on warfarin, which has been used as a blood thinner for over 50 years and halves the risk of stroke, or more expensive alternatives.

While warfarin is an inexpensive drug and proven to work, getting the dose right can be tricky. Patients must go for regular blood tests to ensure they are ‘in range’. Too high a dose can result in dangerous internal bleeds.

Under the guidelines, patients must be made aware of newer drugs such as Pradaxa, Xarelto and Eliquis, which are claimed to be at least as effective as warfarin but with fewer side effects.

However, they cost about £2 a day compared with pennies for warfarin.

AF sufferer Cyril Barnes, 65, a postmaster from Gloucestershire, has already moved on to warfarin – though a hospital cardiologist prescribed him aspirin and beta-blockers after a prolonged attack.

He said: ‘I’d read a lot about AF on various websites and knew that aspirin did not protect against stroke.

‘Three weeks later I managed to get an appointment with my GP to try to get my prescription changed. He agreed and said I could go on warfarin straight away.

'I was shocked that the cardiologist had not known that aspirin does not guard against strokes in an AF patient and that I, as the patient, knew more than him.’

According to the Stroke Association, AF is linked to about one in six strokes – or more than 22,500 a year.

If all people with AF received the best treatment available, around 7,000 strokes a year and 2,000 deaths would be prevented.
