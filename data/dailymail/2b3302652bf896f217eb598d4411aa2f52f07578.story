Kevin Phillips scored 130 times for Sunderland – but says even he would struggle for goals in Gus Poyet’s side.

The Leicester City coach remains the only Englishman to win the European Golden Boot following his 30 Premier League goals in red and white in 2000.

Phillips takes on his old club this weekend – a match he admits is a meeting of relegation rivals – but says he has sympathy with the likes of Steven Fletcher and Connor Wickham.

The Black Cats haven't found the net nearly enough this season and are struggling at the foot of the table

Black Cats boss Poyet is one of a number of top-flight coaches who prefer to deploy a lone striker - his side, however, have failed to score in five of 11 league games this season.

Phillips, meanwhile, had Niall Quinn as a foil during his time at the Stadium of Light and told Sportsmail he would not enjoy operating by himself in the current team.

‘Sunderland are no different to a lot of teams in using the system but it would have been interesting to see how I might have fared in it,’ said the 41-year-old, who is now one of Nigel Pearson’s trusted lieutenants at the King Power Stadium.

‘I’ve always backed myself to score goals but I’m glad that so much of my career was spent as one of a pair of strikers.

‘I did play one up front towards the end of my time at Sunderland but I don’t think it was a system which suited us at the time and I didn’t really enjoy it.’

Phillips helped Sunderland to successive seventh-placed finishes under Peter Reid at the turn of the Millennium and won eight England caps during that period.

His partnership with Quinn remains one of the last examples of a devastating duo in the Premier League era, and he added: ‘They were fantastic times for the club and we seemed to score for fun, but I had big Niall alongside me and I think almost every striker prefers to play in a two up front.

‘He created a lot of chances for me, took a lot of the pressure off me and that was one of the secrets to our success.’

Leicester, for the large part, have played two up front this season with Leonardo Ulloa supported by either Jamie Vardy or David Nugent.

But Phillips accepts they are in the minority.

‘It (one up front) is the modern way,’ he said. ‘But it requires a specialist striker to really make it work.

‘And the key to it is that your midfield has got to be very effective at attacking and getting forward to support the frontman.’

Leicester, meanwhile, have lost their last four and have slipped into the bottom three, which is where Sunderland resided until the win at Crystal Palace earlier this month.

And Phillips reflected: ‘We haven’t done badly so far but the key to us staying up is doing well against the teams in and around us - and Sunderland come into that category.’
