Prince George has been clocking up some serious heir-miles this week, jetting off to the Caribbean with his parents, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

The 18-month-old has been whisked away to the tropical luxury of Mustique to celebrate his grandmother Carole Middleton’s 60th birthday at a £10,000-a-week villa.

Also accompanied by his aunt and uncle, Pippa and James, the well-travelled youngster made the 4,287 mile trip this week on a British Airways flight, albeit in first-class seats.

According to fellow travellers he was ‘impeccably behaved’, entertaining himself with soft toys on the nine-hour flight.

The family group then disembarked in St Lucia before hoping onto a private plane which flew them to the island.

Six-month pregnant Kate’s parents – Carole and Michael – will travel out to join them this weekend. They prefer to fly BA as they are still able to obtain a staff discount. 

Mr Middleton was for many years an aircraft dispatcher with the firm while his wife was a stewardess.

It is understood that the family – accompanied by a team of Scotland Yard bodyguards – have taken over Villa Rocina.

Designed and built in 1971 in the style of a Caribbean plantation, it boasts its own 30ft pool as well as stunning views. 

Guests have only to walk a few feet from their garden to snorkel in the crystal-clear Caribbean Sea in front of the house.

Each bedroom has its own en-suite bath and dressing room, and the property has an air-conditioned gym for guests who can tear themselves away from the sun and sand. 

Four members of staff – a chef, a butler, a housekeeper and a gardener – will be on hand throughout the family’s stay to tend to their every whim. 

And there is a spa nearby, for anyone finding themselves in need of extra pampering before the party on January 31.

Staying stylish while pregnant is no easy task. And as much as you may want to be on trend and put together, sometimes the need for comfort just overtakes the desire to work an edgy look.

If you're expecting and need a bit of inspiration for how to dress your bump then look no further than the Duchess of Cambridge. This is one woman who somehow manages to remain completely herself and look chic despite her changing shape.

Last week Kate was spotted in a dress by one of her favourite high street labels, Hobbs, but today she stuck to specialist maternity wear with this very pretty pale blue coat by Seraphine. It's a brand she's worn before, both before and after the birth of Prince George and this candy colored confection is perfect for lightening up her wardrobe on a dark wintry day.

So if you've got a new addition to the family on the way and need a smart cover up then click the link (right) to check out this royal-approved coat now. Or check out the similar looks below in our high street edit. Coast has a dead ringer for Kate's look whether you're pregnant or not.

With its sugar-sand beaches and gently swaying palms, it's no surprise that the Caribbean has proved a hit with holidaying royalty. 

A particular favourite is St Barts, which earlier this year saw Princess Beatrice arrive on its shores for a break.

Part of the Leeward Islands, the island is one of four that make up the French West Indies, and is home to popular celebrity haunts such as Maya's, a beachside restaurant just outside the capital Gustavia.

‘The Caribbean island of St Barts is synonymous with the rich and famous, from Beyonce and Jay-Z to Roman Abramovich,' says MailOnline acting travel editor, Sarah Gordon.

While celebrities are certainly seen here, it is the ultra-wealthy media moguls and steel magnates who really love to splash out on holidays in this exclusive spot.

‘All of that makes it perfect for the royals, who can enjoy the island’s relative privacy and lack of “riff raff” – the island can be difficult and pricy to reach, ensuring most holidaymakers head elsewhere.'

Almost as popular with the royal set is the exclusive island of Mustique, which in January last year, was the scene of Prince George's first ever trip abroad.

While the little prince stayed in a rented villa with his Middleton relatives and will do so again this year, his great aunt Princess Margaret, another royal fond of a Mustique break, sunned in style in the garden of the villa she owned on the island.

Although he is not yet two, Prince George has already travelled to Australia and New Zealand on tour, and taken several private jets to Scotland. 

He also flew to Mustique last year without his father, who was studying at Cambridge University. 

This year Prince William is meant to be revising for exams to become an air ambulance pilot but seems to have taken some time out.

Famed for its pristine beaches and upmarket watering holes, the island is one of the most exclusive destinations in the world. 

It became famous in the 1960s when its owner, Lord Glenconner, gave Princess Margaret a ten-acre plot of land as a wedding present. Paparazzi are banned – making Mustique a magnet for celebrities including Mick Jagger and David Bowie.
