A Mobile, Alabama Navy dad whose daughter took a tumble at the White House on Wednesday didn’t seem at all worried at his daughter's dizzying encounter with 1-year-old Sunny Obama.

‘Google "Ashtyn Gardner White House” She made a bit of a splash today:)’ Navy Lieutenant John Gardner wrote on Facebook, proving he was anything but shaken by his 2-year-old’s fall.

In fact, photos from the day even show him giggling as his little girl manages to stand back up without a single tear.

Down but not out: Michelle Obama pulls Sunny back away from Ashtyn Gardner after the 1.5-year-old pup knocked the girl down. Just over the first lady's elbow is Ashtyn's proud dad, who chuckles as his daughter refuses to cry

Not her first rodeo: At right, Ashtyn shows brother Grey--who turned one-year-old the very day he attended the White House decoration ceremony--how visiting the first family is done. She and her mom Mandy Rogers-Gardner (left) attended the White House Egg Roll a few months back

‘Everyone is concerned and you're laughing! Oh John!!’ a family friend wrote in reply to the light-hearted post.

Gardner was at the Michelle Obama-led holiday decoration unveiling celebration with his entire family, including his wife Mandy Rogers-Gardner and sons Jax and Grey.

It was even little Grey’s first birthday. ‘Meeting the 1st family on your first birthday... Go Grey!’ said Gardner.

Beautiful family: Pictured at the festive White House holiday decorations ceremony are Navy Lt. John Gardner (L to R), 2-year-old Ashtyn, Jax, Mandy Rogers-Gardner, and Grey who turned 1 year old on Wednesday

Watching it happen: The White House pastry chefs could clearly tell something was awry

Knocked down: Mrs Obama tried pulling Sunny back after Ashtyn Gardner hit the floor

Plucky: 2-year-old Ashtyn strikes some confident poses. Despite her fall, the toddler didn't cry a single tear and it won her laughs from her military dad and the embarrassed apologies of America's first lady

He even snapped a photo! Lt. Gardner took a proud snap of his daughter once she found her balance and rejoined the group

Big brother: Jax Gardner, left, looked concerned for his little sister but needn't have worried about the tough girl's well being. She even let Sunny stand right next to her after the mishap

But it was Ashtyn who stole the show 
when Sunny Obama, the first family’s one-and-a-half year old Portuguese 
Water Dog got a little too excited for her to handle.

Sunny jumped up on Ashtyn and pushed her to the ground Wednesday afternoon as the press quickly took the chance to snap away.

Ashtyn
 was one of the hundreds of children from military families who were on 
hand to help the First Lady display this year's decorations.

Damage control: Mrs Obama looked more concerned about the run-in than Ashtyn herself

The aftermath: The situation was resolved amicably as Ashtyn gave Sunny another chance

Making up for harm done: Mrs Obama gave the little girl a big hug to apologize for the dog's behavior

A video of the encounter shows that 
Sunny was being held on a leash by Mrs Obama during the ordeal but that 
didn't stop her from knocking the girl over.

There were no hard feelings- or injuries- as Sunny proceeded to lick 2-year-old Ashtyn's face as she was hugged by Mrs Obama.

That wasn't the only way that Sunny ruined the event- at least in the eyes of the family's older dog.

Bo
 had previously been the star of earlier Christmas displays, with 
countless versions of it's likeness scattered about the White House, but
 this year he had to share the spotlight with his little sister.

Two life-sized replicas of the 
Portuguese water dogs made of satin ribbons are one of the first things 
an expected 70,000 White House visitors will see this month.

Dark chocolate miniatures of the first pets are also part of the annual gingerbread White House display.

Another
 highlight is the towering Blue Room tree, dedicated to military 
families and trimmed with photos of their joyous homecomings.

Mrs.
 Obama says she wants Americans to never forget the debt they owe 
service members and their families for the sacrifices they make in 
serving the country.

Sharing the spotlight: This is the first year that the decorations will feature both of the Obama's dogs, with custom decorations showing Bo's white patches and Sunny's all-black fur

Special attention: Since the Obamas moved into the White House, the first party unveiling the annual Christmas decorations every year has been held for a crowd of military families

Decking the halls: In addition to using a crew of volunteers, a number of specialists from the Obama's hometown of Chicago are believed to have helped with the 2013 decorations

Using their talents: The children were occupied by various arts and crafts projects
