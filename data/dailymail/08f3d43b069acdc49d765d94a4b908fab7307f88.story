Frank Sinatra was taking selfies decades before it was cool.

A new photo exhibit of Ol' Blue Eyes, The Sinatra Experience, opens March 5 at the Morrison Hotel Gallery in New York City, and among the photos of a young Frank Sinatra is one he snapped of himself in a bathroom mirror all the way back in 1938.

He was just 23-years-old at the time.

This as 2015 marks the 100th anniversary of the singer's birth

The photos in the exhibit won't just be of Sinatra either, but also some of his family members. 

As The New York Times points out, the exhibit is just one of the many things that will celebrate the 100th anniversary of the iconic singer's birth.

Artist Peter Max will unveil 47 new paintings of the singer and show them at his studio in New York City on March 2, alongside Sinatra's daughter Nancy. 

There will also be a documentary airing on HBO this April, a multimedia exhibition at the New York Public Library, Sinatra: An American Icon, set to open next month and a discussion about his career at the Grammy Museum, also next month.

The Grammy Museum exhibit will also give guests a chance to check out of some of the exciting things happening between Jack Daniel’s and Sinatra for his big anniversary, as it was his favorite brand of alcohol.

There will be a 1950 bottle similar to the one Sinatra would ahve had in his own bar as well as Belle of Lincoln Jack Daniel’s Decanters (1 out of 32 ever made) with the names of all the characters that Sinatra played.

And, for fans across the country, a Jack Daniels Sinatra Select whiskey has been released.

All this leading up to the actual 100th anniversary, which will happen on December 12.
