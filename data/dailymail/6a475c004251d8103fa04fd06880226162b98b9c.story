A plasterer was hailed a hero today for punching and detaining a hoodie after catching him red-handed stealing lead from the church next to his home.

Catholic Jon-Paul Fawcett, 28, was watching Euro 2012 when he spotted yob Neil Langley stealing lead from the church window pane, balancing on a vase taken from a nearby grave.

He was so disgusted that he stormed up to him saying: 'What do you think you are playing at, nicking from a church?'

Hero: Catholic plasterer Jon-Paul Fawcett, 28,
 was watching Euro 2012 when he spotted yob Neil Langley stealing lead 
from the church opposite his home and stormed over to confront him

When Langley, 30, lashed out Mr Fawcett, thumped him in self defence, fearing he was armed with a chisel, then carried out a citizen's arrest grabbing him by the arms then pinning him to the ground while police were called to the scene.

During the scuffle, Mr Fawcett's mobile phone accidentally rang his father who overheard the commotion and was so upset he had a heart attack. He has since recovered.

Today, as Langley began 12 weeks jail for theft, Mr Fawcett, who has a close connection to St Paul's Church in Nelson, Lancashire and recently became a godparent there, was commended for his bravery.

Yob: Neil Langley has been jailed for 12 weeks for theft after being caught red-handed by Mr Fawcett

'It was just instinct and I would do 
it again in a flash if I had to,' said Mr Fawcett who lives in a street 
to the adjacent to the church. 'I didn’t really consider that I might 
have got hurt but it was my duty to do something and protect my 
community.

'I was brought up
 a Catholic and my two kids are Catholic and it’s despicable. Only three
 weeks ago I was in that church fulfilling my role as a godfather at a 
Christening. It’s a lovely church both inside and out that is about 200 
years old.

'It was insulting
 that he could do something like this. Thefts like this are not fair on 
the elderly people who live around here either. They have moved here for
 a quiet, peaceful life and something like this happens.

'That guy was scum and he effectively made my dad have a heart attack.

‘The
 amount of jobs which we get called out to where a property is leaking 
because of a metal theft or a shop which has had lead taken is 
unbelievable.

'They are 
low-life's. And to steal from a church, they should be put in the 
gutter, I’m glad he’s gone to prison. He had absolutely no shame doing 
this in broad daylight.'

Burnley
 magistrates court was told Mr Fawcett had been watching a Euro 2012 
football match TV when he looked up at half-time and spotted Langley 
stripping lead flashing at 8.30pm on June 13 this year.

He went outside and shouted at 
Langley to stop only for the yob to deny stealing and to falsely claim 
he was putting the window pane back.

Mr
 Fawcett added: 'I could see somebody wearing a black hooded jacket 
messing about and he even taken a vase from someone’s grave to stand on 
so he could get to the lead.

Theft: Langley tried to deny stealing lead from the window pane falsely claiming he was putting it back

Furious: Langley targeted St Paul's Church in Nelson, Lancashire and Mr Fawcett said stealing from a church is the 'lowest of the low'. Many people turned out to watch the commotion when the surprise arrest was made

'I
 was furious. I thought it was disgusting what he had been doing. He was
 coming towards me with his arms waving. I thought he was going to take a
 swing for me so I just punched him.

'Then
 he tried to turn around to make a run for it so I gripped him and made a
 citizen’s arrest. I grabbed the back of his hands and grabbed hold of 
his belt which snapped and it cut all my hand. I knew I had to get him.

'Then
 I got his arm and put it up his back so he couldn’t move and held on to
 him. There was a lot of commotion and a bit of a scuffle but nothing 
serious. I did what I had to do to restrain him.

'I
 go to the gym so I’m quite strong and I knew I was stronger than him. 
He was saying ‘can we just talk’ but I thought ‘no what you are doing is
 wrong’. It’s the lowest of the low stealing from a church and he is 
scum.

Community spirit: Jon-Paul Fawcett with Rev Fr Philip Knowles outside the 200-year-old St Paul's Church. Rev Knowles said it's nice to know that there are people who are looking out for the community

'Meanwhile elderly people had come out of their houses to see what was going on and they were all watching. I shouted for them to call the police.

'I had his arm up behind his back and I walked him over to where they were stood. He kept pleading with me to ask if we could talk but I wasn’t having any of it.

'Unbeknown to me, my phone was in my pocket and had called my dad. He had picked it up and he’d heard the commotion and started to panic. He thought I was in trouble at first. Shortly afterwards he suffered a heart attack and had to hospital.

'When the police arrived they knew who he was instantly and addressed him using first name terms.

'My phone started ringing and it was my mum telling me how proud she was because they’d heard everything on the phone.

'She kept saying, ‘I’m so proud of you’, but then she said my dad was having a funny turn and then my sister called to say he’d been taken to hospital in an ambulance.'

Catholic: Jon-Paul has a close connection to the church and was pictured at a christening service (at the back in a light grey suit and black shirt) just three weeks ago

In court Mrs Alex Mann prosecuting said: 'The church warden says that lead was missing and other pieces of lead were loose. It will cost a substantial amount of money to fix.'

In mitigation for the former drug addict, defence lawyer Ben Leech said: 'He has very little recollection of what happened.

'He had been in a pub and had got himself in some trouble either inside or outside of it and tried to escape by going into the churchyard. He believed his drink may have been spiked.'

After the case Rev Fr Philip Knowles of St Paul’s Church said: 'It is very sad that people feel that they have to fund whatever they have to fund by doing something like this through criminal activity.

'It’s sad and I feel for them that they end up doing something like this.

'The church is 200 years old and there has been a church on this site for the last 800 years. Lead thefts is something that all churches have been suffering from. Obviously the broken pane of glass will have to be replaced at a cost.

'People like Jon-Paul who just happened to see what was going on felt compelled to do something. It is nice to know that there are people like him who are looking out for the community and it shows good community spirit.'
