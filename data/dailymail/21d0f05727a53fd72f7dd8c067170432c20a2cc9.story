Having attacked their own players last week, fans of Peruvian club Alianza Lima turned on each other as they crashed out of the Copa Libertadores on Wednesday.

The oldest team in the Peruvian First Division could only manage a goalless draw with Argentina's Huracan in the second leg of South America's equivalent to the Champions League, sending them out of the competition 4-0 on aggregate.

The game in Buenos Aries was marred by chaotic scenes of crowd trouble after Alianza supporters fought amongst themselves - using belts and shoes as makeshift weapons while young children were shielded from the violence.

Both teams slowed down the game in protest and, were it not for  goalkeeper George Forsyth's superb save from Ramon Abila's overhead kick, Alianza almost lost the tie to inflame fans' frustration even further.

Last week, Alianza fans reportedly stormed the dressing room following the 4-0 defeat to Huracan at home and attacked their own team - wounding two leading players.

Newspaper El Comercio reported that around 60 fans burst into the Alejandro Villanueva stadium and beat several players while pointing a gun at two others.

Forward Christian Cueva and midfielder Victor Cedron were injured in the attack with local sports daily El Bocon claiming both are now considering leaving the club.

Cueva was guilty of punching a fan after the first leg defeat to Huracan, but later apologised.
