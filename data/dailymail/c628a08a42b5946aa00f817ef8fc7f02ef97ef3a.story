Luton Town are still awaiting their first victory on home soil since returning to the Football League after falling to a narrow 1-0 defeat against Plymouth Argyle at Kenilworth Road.  

Dominic Blizzard's superb solo goal after the interval was enough to clinch all three points for the visitors, who made it back-to-back wins in the league as a result.

In turn after a win at Carlisle on the opening day of the season the Hatters have failed to win since, picking up just two points from their next five league games. 

Clinical: Dominic Blizzard fires home with aplomb as Plymouth made it back-to-back wins in the league

Euphoria: Blizzard celebrates his all-important second-half goal with team-mate Carl McHugh

Luton: Tyler; Connolly, Griffiths, McNulty, Lacey; Howells, (Lawless 69), Rooney, Guttridge, Ruddock Mpanzu, Drury (Stevenson 78), Cullen (Lafayette 71).

Subs not used: Smith,  Wall,  Wilkinson, Justham.

Plymouth: McCormick, Mellor, Nelson, Hartley, McHugh, Alessandra, Cox, O’Connor, Blizzard, Banton (Bray 58) (Smalley 70), Reid.

Subs not used: Bittner, Purrington, Norburn, Harvey, Thomas.

Goals scored: Blizzard 68 

It was the visitors who has the first real goalscoring opportunity of the game when Lewis Alessandra was put through with just Mark Tyler to beat, but his tame effort was comfortably saved by the Luton No 1.

Following their lucky escape at the other end the hosts went on to take control of the game, and were mightily unlucky not to take the lead on 29 minutes when Luke McCormick made an impressive save from Luke Guttridge's close range effort.

Just before half-time the hosts were again thwarted when Jake Howells looked set to cap off a impressive free-flowing move but McCormick produced another fine save to keep the scoreline goalless.

Disappointing: John Still would have been hoping for a better start to the season for his Luton side

After the break the game turned in the visitors' favour with Dominic Blizzard firing them ahead on 68 minutes with a fierce low-range drive after skipping past numerous Luton players en route to goal.

The hosts huffed and puffed as they tried to get back into the game, throwing on forward Ross Lafayette in the closing stages, but ultimately it came to no avail.

As a result last year's Conference champions remain firmly poised in the bottom half of the table, with Plymouth moving into the play-off positions with a win ahead of the 3pm kick-offs.

Elsewhere in League Two Cheltenham went top of Sky Bet League Two despite their stalemate with Morecambe at the Globe Arena.

Last-gasp drama: Sub Adebayo Azeez scores with just seconds remaining to grab a point for AFC Wimbledon

Carlisle and AFC Wimbledon played out a thrilling 4-4 draw at Brunton Park with former Charlton striker Adebayo Azeez coming off the bench to rescue a point for the Dons with an injury-time leveller.

Danny Hylton also rescued a point for Oxford as the strugglers hit back at Southend to earn a share of the spoils, with Northampton moving into the play-off positions after Marc Richards' first-half double earned the Cobblers a win at Dagenham & Redbridge.

Wycombe maintained their positive start to the season as they played out a 0-0 draw against Bury at Adams Park, as both sides remain in the play-off spots.

Exeter also dropped to the summit of the Football League as they lost 2-1 at home to Mansfield, failing to recover from the Stags' two-goal first-half lead after the interval.
