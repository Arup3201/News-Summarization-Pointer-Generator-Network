Comic Relief will have raised more than £1billion for charity once next year’s appeal has finished.

Screenwriter Richard Curtis, who set up the charity in 1985 with Lenny Henry, said he hoped to pass the mark on Red Nose Day in March. 

According to its latest accounts, the charity still has £108million sitting in its investment portfolio.

The revelation comes after another BBC-backed charity - Children in Need - admitted it is sitting on investments of £87.7million. 

But Mr Curtis, who is the author of Blackadder and Four Weddings and a Funeral, boasted that next year’s Comic Relief campaign was likely to net the charity more money than ever.

The 57-year-old told the Radio Festival in Salford: ‘Unless a horrible scandal occurs and it turns out Lenny Henry has been killing and eating children all these years, I think we are going to cross a billion pounds.’

He joked: ‘I think we’re going to cross a billion rather earlier in the evening than we’d like. You’d have hoped we’d reach a billion about 11.40pm.

‘You’d be able to say “Come on, reach a billion.”

‘I think there will be something rather tiring about reaching a billon at 8.04pm and then saying “Who’d like to help start the next billion?”

‘So I think what we’ll do is actually talk a lot about what each individual donation can do. I hope it will be an amazing year.’

A Comic Relief spokesman said the charity has raised £960million to date. 

The last Red Nose Day, in 2013, raised more than £75million in one night after an eight hour show on BBC1 and BBC2, passing 2011’s record total of £74.3million.

That year, it gave out more than £103million to good causes, principally to charities that fight poverty in sub-Saharan Africa.

But it was mired in scandal after it emerged the charity had pumped millions of pounds of donations into controversial ‘bombs, booze and fags’ funds even as it backed projects to help victims of alcohol abuse, war and smoking-related illnesses. 

Following a public backlash, the charity pledged to be ‘more transparent’ with its cash in future and said it would no longer invest in arms or tobacco firms, or companies ‘whose primary business is the manufacture of alcohol products’. 

During Comic Relief broadcasts, celebrities including David Beckham, Jennifer Saunders and Graham Norton have repeated the charity’s pledge that ‘for every pound the charity gets directly from the public a pound goes to helping transform the lives of people living with poverty and social injustice’.

The charity’s latest accounts show it employs nearly 300 people with a £13million annual wage bill.

Chief executive Kevin Cahill’s pay has increased from £111,000 to £131,000 since 2008, with five directors earning more than £80,000.

A Comic Relief spokesman said: ‘There is always a significant amount of money that has been committed to charities and projects that is waiting to be paid out.

This is because we pay grants in instalments, so that we can monitor how the money has been spent before giving the next instalment.

‘Comic Relief takes grant making very seriously and works hard to ensure the money awarded is spent as agreed.

‘This money has been donated and it would be unprofessional to pay it all out in single payments without these checks.’

‘The salary of Comic Relief’s chief executive is approximately £34,000 less than the average for chief executives in the top 100 charities.’
