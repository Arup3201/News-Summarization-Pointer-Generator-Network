Random attack? Hervey Medellin's neighbour said he heard loud fighting about three weeks ago

A man whose dismembered head, hands, and feet were found in a Hollywood park regularly hiked the area, a friend said.

Hervey Medellin, a 66-year-old 
retired airline worker enjoyed trekking the rugged, hillside park, which
was near his Hollywood apartment.

According to his friend Vilma Aguilar, he met a new friend while hiking Griffith Park last year.

Police said they were working round 
the clock to hunt down the retiree's killer. Commander Andrew Smith said
Friday: 'They did serve a search warrant last night. They are following
clues, and the case is progressing.'

Medellin's head was found by two dog walkers earlier this week in the hills by the famed Hollywood sign.

Detectives questioned at least one 
man Thursday after serving a search warrant at Medellin’s apartment 
complex, towing a silver Honda from the building that evening, the Los 
Angeles Times reports.

Having worked for Mexicana Airlines for 20 years, Medellin was retired and collected expensive art, CBS reported.

Neighbours said they had grown concerned when they didn't see him out walking his dog in the park in recent weeks.

Andrew Hill, who lives on the second 
storey of Medellin’s apartment complex, told the Times that around three
weeks ago, he heard a loud altercation.

Furniture was being moved, Mr Hill 
said, and he heard screaming and shouting in the middle of the night. 
Detectives later asked him what time he saw the trash being taken out 
Thursday, he said.

The grisly discovery was made in the land close to Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's Hollywood Hills mansion, and because the area
is often used for filming, the couple who found the head first thought 
it was a film prop.

The area was a location for the original 'Batcave' 
in the 1960s Batman series starring Adam West.

Lauren Kornberg and her friend were walking nine dogs and 
saw two of the animals playing with an object in a bag.

'Our assumption was that there was always people filming up there, and it was a prop,' said Mrs Kornberg.

'We walked down the ravine and got closer and realized it was a freshly severed human head.'

Investigators did not believe it had been there long calling the head 'fresh'.

Then late on Wednesday night, two hand and two feet were discovered near the city's iconic Hollywood sign.

There are reports today that detectives are questioning a person of interest in connection with the discovery.

Investigators raided a Los Angeles apartment building last night near to where the human remains were found, KFI-AM reported.

The events have unfolded like a gory movie script, and police are now 
trying to identity the man.

More than 100 police 
officers, some on horseback, searched a Hollywood wilderness park 
along a winding hiking trail.

The first hand was 
found as dozens of officers and homicide investigators combed the brush,
and a coroner's cadaver dog came upon it about 50 yards from where the 
head was discovered on Tuesday afternoon, the Los Angeles Times 
reported.The second hand and both
feet were found nearby later Wednesday afternoon. No details were 
immediately available on the condition of the body parts.

The man might have been killed elsewhere in recent days and his body dumped in the park, Cmdr Smith said.

LAPD mounted police officers search a hilly area below the Hollywood sign. Following the discovery of the head, two hands and then two feet were found

Wild animals in the park may have other body parts, he said.

Police
were looking at reports of missing persons, and coroner's investigators
were to check dental records to try and determine his identity.

Smith
noted that the area is well traveled by both cars and hikers. A paved 
road winds around picnic areas and a children's playground before 
connecting with a trail that eventually winds up near the Hollywood 
sign.

The Hollywood sign on
Mount Lee above Los Angeles originally read 'Hollywoodland' and was 
created to promote a housing development in 1923.

The last few letters deteriorated in the late 1940s and the part that remained was restored in 1978.
