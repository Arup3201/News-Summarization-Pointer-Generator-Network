Marco Materazzi has reignited his infamous feud with Zinedine Zidane for a good cause by nominating the Frenchman to take part in the Ice Bucket challenge.

Former Italy defender Materazzi allegedly goaded the France international during the 2006 World Cup final, forcing Zidane to flip and headbutt the centre back in the chest before being sent off.

Now eight years on, Materazzi, who played for Everton in the late 90s, has challenged his former rival to become the latest star to take part in the craze which has swept the world in aid of the ALS charity.

Revealing: Materazzi then removed the shirt to reveal his very own Inter Milan jersey

Soaked: Materazzi used the Champions League trophy for the challenge before nominating Zidane

Throwing down the gauntlet to former Real Madrid star 'Zizou', the 41-year-old wore a Juventus 'Zidane' shirt before taking it off to reveal his own Inter Milan jersey.

Boasting of his success as a player, Materazzi used the Champions League trophy to undertake the challenge.

Having both won the World Cup - Materazzi came out on top in 2006 - and Champions League, Zidane will no doubt be keen to keep up with his competitive former foe.
