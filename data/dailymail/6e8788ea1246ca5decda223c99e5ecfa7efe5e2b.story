A pilot  who flew on a mission to West Africa and began experiencing ‘flu-like symptoms’ when he returned home was tested for Ebola but has been declared free of the deadly virus.

The pilot from the 437th Airlift Wing based in Charleston, South Carolina, flew to Liberia  on a three-hour mission on October 23.

He  began experiencing ‘flu-like symptoms' when he arrived back in the U.S but was considered low risk because he never left the plane.

Ebola free: Members of the 437th Airlift Wing based in Charleston, South Carolina stand beside their plane, this week one of their pilots was tested for the Ebola Virus

Isolation pod: The patient was transported to the hospital in an ‘isolation pod’ to minimise the risk of spreading any possible infection

Low risk: This week, doctors at the Medical University of South Carolina where he was being treated downgraded him from ‘low risk’ to ‘no risk’ of Ebola.

This week, doctors at the Medical University of South Carolina where he was being treated downgraded him from being ‘low risk’ to having ‘no risk’ of Ebola.

However, doctors say they will continue to monitor him as an extra precaution. 

MUSC spokesman Tony Ciuffo said: ’In consultation with DHEC, CDC and the Department of Defense, it has been confirmed that the patient had no contact with anyone in Liberia, and based on this information, he has been determined to have no risk for Ebola.'

'The patient will be removed from Ebola precautions, and no quarantine will be required.’

According to Staff Sergeant Anthony Hyatt, the serviceman, who lives off-base, began experiencing the symptoms on Wednesday, and was transported to MUSC on Friday morning.

Officials from Joint Base Charleston coordinated with the state's Department of Health and Environmental Control to exercise ‘the appropriate protocols and an abundance of caution.'

According to the U.S. Department of Defense pilots who travel to and from an airfield of a country where an Ebola outbreak is occurring will not be held for controlled monitoring if they meet the following guidelines:

The hospital which is an 'Ebola ready' hospital swung into action to deal with the serviceman according to Fox News Carolina. 

It is one of three hospitals in the state prepared to take on Ebola patients and has an isolation wing.

MUSC spokesperson Heather Woolwine said; ‘Late yesterday evening, we got a patient who required an Ebola medical screening.’ 

The patient was then transported to the hospital in an ‘isolation pod’ to keep the risk of spreading any possible infection between the patient and attending medical staff to a minimum. 

He was treated on an isolated ward and anyone who treated him was required to wear protective gear. 

Hyat said: 'Servicemen who travel to the countries in Africa which have been affected by Ebola are monitored for 21 days, and so far, only the pilot in question has shown any adverse symptoms.’

‘MUSC followed protective protocol as a precautionary measure.’  

‘The patient remains in isolation and the initial assessment indicates the patient is unlikely to have Ebola,’ MUSC said. 

No risk: The pilot was cleared of Ebola as he only spent three hours in the region and never left the plane

Monitor: Servicemen who travel to Ebola-affected countries in Africa are monitored for 21 days

Outbreak: The World Health Organization said nearly 5,000 people have died from the Ebola virus disease in the three West African countries at the center of the current Ebola outbreak

‘However we will continue to monitor the patient closely in the isolation unit.’ 

The pilot landed at an airport in Liberia which was operated by U.S. personnel who had no contact with Ebola patients. Its American personnel also self-monitor for adverse symptoms twice daily.

Hyatt added: ‘Upon landing, the crew left their engines running and remained on the flight deck for the entirety of their three hours and nine minutes on the ground.’ 

‘In other words, there were many layers of separation put in place to protect transiting aircrew.’ 

Hyatt also confirmed that no food from Liberia was served to crews while the plane was on the ground. 

According to the World Health Organization, nearly 5,000 people have died from the Ebola virus disease in the three West African countries at the center of the current Ebola outbreak.

A total of 4,950 people have died of Ebola in the three countries, the WHO said. 

The United Nations health agency said 13,241 confirmed, suspected or probable cases of Ebola had been reported in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone -  the three worst affected countries.
