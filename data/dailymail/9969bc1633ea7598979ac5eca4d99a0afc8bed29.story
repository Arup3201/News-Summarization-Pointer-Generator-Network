Wayne Rooney is planning to hit the high notes at the World Cup this summer and the England striker has already prepared his playlist for Brazil.

The 28-year-old's soundtracks for South America include 'Money On My Mind' by Sam Smith, 'Goodbye My Lover' by James Blunt and a selection of other mainstream tunes.

Rooney posted his Spotify playlist to his fans on Twitter, alongside the message: 'this is my world cup album 2014 hope everyone enjoys it. Bit of a mixed bag'.

The United star missed the end of the season with a groin problem and took fitness and conditioning experts with him on holiday at the end of the campaign, determined to stay in shape after disappointments at his two previous World Cup tournaments.

In 2006, he recovered from a broken metatarsal but lacked sharpness and erupted with a red card during England's quarter-final defeat against Portugal.

Four years ago he was also suffering niggling problems and fitness issues which limited his work in training.

Hodgson will hope this time it is different for Rooney and is sure to be encouraged by the evidence since his squad assembled last week.
