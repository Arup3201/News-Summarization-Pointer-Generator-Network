The Texas Department of Criminal Justice says polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs is no longer hospitalized and has been returned to prison in East Texas.

Agency spokesman Robert Hurst confirmed Thursday that Jeffs has been discharged from Hospital Galveston, a TDCJ facility southeast of Houston.

Hurst declined to provide the reason for Jeffs' hospitalization, citing medical privacy laws.

Jeffs was admitted March 11 and discharged Monday. He returned to the Powledge unit in Palestine to continue serving a life sentence.

Attorney Roger Hoole was one of the last people to speak with Jeffs before he was hospitalized this month.

Hoole traveled to Texas to collect a deposition from Jeffs, who was subpoenaed to testify in Utah court regarding a custody case with one of the men he excommunicated from his church.

On his visit, Hoole descried Jeffs as looking 'gaunt, thin and ashamed'.

'He looks at the ground when you ask him questions about his conduct,' Hoole told Fox 13.

The 58-year-old Jeffs is the ecclesiastical head of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. He was convicted in 2011 of sexually assaulting two of his child brides, ages 12 and 15.

He also was hospitalized shortly after his conviction when he became ill while fasting.
