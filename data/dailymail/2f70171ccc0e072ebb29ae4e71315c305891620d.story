The viral campaign to get a Taylor Swift song to enter Triple J's Hottest 100 has turned ugly with fans of the pop star receiving death threats and being compared to the Islamic State. 

Eliza Day from Melbourne who helped kick start the campaign two weeks ago was targeted on her Instagram account on Thursday when a user told her: 'I hope you die a slow, painful death'.

'When I first saw those Instagram comments I just shrugged, turned Shake It Off on and danced around my house singing "haters gonna hate hate hate hate hate",' she told the Herald Sun.

The viral campaign to get a Taylor Swift song to enter Triple J's Hottest 100 has turned ugly with fans of the pop star receiving death threats and being compared to the Islamic State 

The hashtag #Tay4Hottest100 has been trending almost all week in a bid to get Swift's Shake It Off song to feature in Triple J's top 100 songs for 2014.

'I have blocked the people who made the comments. Cyber bullying is never ever OK. Like, ever,' Ms Day said. 

One Twitter user also took aim at the Swift campaign by comparing fans to the Islamic State saying 'both needed to be wiped out'.

'The biggest misconception is that being a Taylor Swift fan and being an avid Triple J listener are mutually exclusive. While it’s true in some cases, I and many other people fall into both categories,' Ms Day said. 

'I'm passionate about the music I love but I certainly don’t resent anyone for disagreeing with my tastes, nor can I comprehend wishing death upon someone over it.'

ABC managing director Mark Scott shook off the viral campaign on Thursday issuing a tweet saying 'It's gonna be alright @triplej' about the trending hashtag. 

It kicked off after Joe McKenzie tweeted Scott about the omission of Swift's hit from the Triple J's Hottest 100 voting list.

'Triple J is refusing to let me vote for Taylor Swift in the Hottest 100 I personally blame @mcscott [Scott's Twitter handle],' he wrote.

To which, Scott replied: 'Shake it off Joe.'

Voting for the Hottest 100 closes on Sunday and the results will be aired on Australia Day. 

Triple J - which is controlled by the ABC - provides 2,000 songs played on the radio station during the year for people to choose from in their votes. 

But the system allows voter to manually enter their selections, which some decided to take advantage of.

'So this just happened,' Rachael Tomic tweeted including a photo of her top 10 votes, which were all Taylor Swift songs.

While Venessa Paech threw her support behind Swift.

'If we're being honest we'd admit Shake if Off is a better crafted song than most of the noise on JJJ,' she said.

Even the Australian Bureau of Statistics weighed in on the debate, saying: 'Shake it off, Australia! The Census gives no insights into how many ‘Haters’ there are in Australia. #Tay4hottest100.'

The media boss issued a tweet on Thursday responding to the #Tay4Hottest100 campaign, which has taken the internet by storm

Others against the move to include Shake It Off on the list were also vocal on the matter.

'It was hard enough to narrow down to 10 songs without losing one of those to Taylor Swift. Sorry TayTay,' Anna tweeted. 

Shake It Off is amongst the most favoured to take out number one spot on the Hottest 100, according to betting agencies. 

A Triple J spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia she could not comment on the movement.

'We don't comment on voting campaigns whilst Hottest 100 voting is open, as it may influence the results of the poll,' she said. 

Supporters have taken to Twitter, sharing their Hottest 100 votes on the social media site

While Venessa Paech threw her support behind Swift.'If we're being honest we'd admit Shake if Off is a better crafted song than most of the noise on JJJ.'

Even the ABS got on board the bandwagon, tweeting this gem on Wednesday afternoon

But with the supporters, there were also those who did not want Taylor Swift entering the charts
