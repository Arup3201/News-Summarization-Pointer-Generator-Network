Death: Leisure centre lifeguard Jake Harris, 21, was said to have gone 'crazy' at an all-night house party in Manchester

A father-to-be died after slitting his own throat with a broken wine glass when he suffered a devastating reaction to a legal high.

Jake Harris, 21, is said to have gone 'crazy' at an all-night party after taking a mind-bending drug known as N-Bomb.

As he was suffering terrifying hallucinations, Mr Harris, a leisure centre lifeguard, was heard shouting and pleading: 'I want it to stop.'

He then broke a wine glass on a bedside cabinet and used a thick shard to slice his throat open.

The legal high, which was banned in the UK just days after the incident, has been blamed for half a dozen deaths in the US.

Similar in chemical make-up to LSD, it can give the distorted appearance that time and movement are going faster or slower.

Colour, sound and objects can get distorted visually and users can experience extreme double vision.

An inquest heard that Mr Harris and friend Steven Higgins, 27, had gone to a party at the luxury flat of Heather Turner, 28, near Manchester city centre.

The court was told she had already picked up some cocaine and vodka to share with revellers but Mr Higgins supplied the N-Bomb drug to his friend. He believed it was LSD and said he wanted to 'test' its effect before visiting the Glastonbury festival.

The inquest was told that the party in May this year went on all night and in the morning Mr Harris and Mr Higgins went to shops to get more alcohol.

Miss Turner said: 'As they got back they said they had taken LSD but they didn't seem any different at all – I didn't notice any changes. They brought vodka back but I'm not sure it was opened. We just sat on the bed talking and I fell asleep after a few hours.'

She said she was woken at around noon by Mr Higgins shouting 'calm down' at his friend who was sitting on the apartment floor.

'When I turned round I remember Jake was sat next to the floor-to-ceiling window and he jumped up off the floor and threw himself at it. He hit the window with his shoulder and got caught in the blind and landed on the floor.'

Involved: Steven Higgins (pictured) supplied the N-Bomb drug to Jake believing it to be LSD, which he wanted to 'test' before visiting the Glastonbury music festival in June, the inquest was told

Dangerous: During a hallucinogenic experience, father-to-be Mr Harris was heard shouting 'I want it to stop'

Scene: Mr Harris went to a luxury flat at the Spectrum apartment complex near Manchester city centre

N-Bomb is known to have killed at least five people in US states including Arizona, North Dakota and Louisiana.

Noah Carrasco, 18, of Scottsdale, Arizona, died in January after taking N-Bomb, which he mistakenly thought was LSD.

Anthony Carlson, also 18 and from Scottsdale, died three months later after taking just a few drops of the drug up his nose.

And Clayton Otwell, 21, of Little Rock, Arkansas, died in October 2012 after taking a single drop of the drug at a festival.

Other deaths have been reported to be linked to N-Bomb over the last few years in California, Texas, Louisiana, Minnesota and Virginia. The drug can be consumed in powder or liquid form.

Miss Turner told the inquest in 
Bolton: 'Steven got up and had his arms around him and told him to calm 
down. They landed back on the bed and next to the bed was a chest of 
drawers and a box with glasses in it.

'There were two wine glasses and he 
grabbed one of them and smashed it on the side and then stabbed himself 
in the side of the throat. Steven let go of his arm and he continued to 
put the glass in his throat.'

The pair ran outside to alert neighbours and immediately called an ambulance before running back into the apartment.

Miss Turner added: 'As we walked back 
in Jake was lying down the side of the bed. I was grabbing towels to 
stop the blood but I couldn't go near him. I was so scared.'

Mr Higgins said he 'didn't feel 
massively different' after taking the N-Bomb drug and claimed his friend
was still in good spirits at 10am.

But he became more and more agitated before trying to shoulder charge his way through a first-floor window of the apartment.

Mr Higgins added: 'He said he wanted 
it to stop and it was different to anything he had ever done before.

'I 
told him to relax as much as possible. He was agitated for about half an
hour before he threw himself at the window – it wasn't all of a 
sudden.'

He then broke a wine glass on a 
bedside cabinet and used a thick shard to slice his throat from the ear 
to the opposite side of his chest.

Despite efforts by paramedics and 
doctors to stem the blood loss Mr Harris, of Manchester, died ten hours 
later from his injuries in hospital.

Tests showed he had taken the 
251-NBOMe drug – a recently discovered psychedelic substance which was a
'legal high' at the time of his death on May 28.

The drug has been banned since June 
10, 2013 under a temporary class drug order and will remain illegal for 
at least 12 months while drug experts consider the full range of harms.

Police arrested Miss Turner and Mr 
Higgins over the tragedy but concluded no crime had been committed as 
the drug was a legal high.

The inquest will be concluded at a later date pending further toxicology results.
