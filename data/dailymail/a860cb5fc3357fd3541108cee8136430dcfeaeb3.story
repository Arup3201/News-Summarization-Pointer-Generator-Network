Carjackers left a man for dead after stabbing him repeatedly in a botched bid to steal his Mercedes.

Stephen Bennett, 59, was leaving the home of a relative who had died recently when he was ambushed by two men demanding the keys to his £25,000 car.

Shocked neighbours saw Mr Bennett being dragged to the floor, punched and kicked before being stabbed with a large knife.

The man was targeted outside his home in Worcester Avenue in Hindley, Wigan, where his Mercedes was parked

The men ran off following the attack at 10am on Sunday. Mr Bennett managed to stagger to a house to raise the alarm.

He is in a ‘very serious’ condition in
hospital after suffering 12 stab wounds to his arms and neck although 
his injuries are not life-threatening.

Philip Leyland, 50, said Mr Bennett 
was subjected to ‘horrific’ violence by the carjackers, one of whom wore
a balaclava.

Mr Leyland, a mechanic who had been visiting his father in
the quiet residential street in Hindley, hear Wigan, said: ‘They were 
beating the hell out of him and I tried to get out of my car to help but
they pulled this knife out and then stabbed him.

‘They had been trying to pinch his new
Mercedes. It was incredibly shocking because they were kicking the hell
out of him and all just for a car. I got out to help but as I did one 
of the men picked up a huge blade and threatened me with it, so I backed
off.

The incident happened on Worcester Avenue and it is believed the attackers fled down an alley Smithwood Avenue in Hindley, Wigan

‘They didn’t get the car – they ran 
off down the street and the older guy hobbled to a neighbour’s house. He
looked in a bad way and was covered in blood.’

Resident John Primrose, 40, said: 
‘Once they stabbed him they ran down an alleyway. It was terrible 
because he was covered in blood and hobbling all over the place. It’s 
terrifying to think something like this has happened on our road.’

Neighbour William Leyland, 76, said: ‘It was awful and the street is covered in his blood.

‘This is such a nice, quiet 
neighbourhood but sometimes you get young lads coming from other estates
to cause trouble and steal because they know people round here are nice
and well-to-do.’

Elizabeth Meadows, 68, said: ‘He came 
to my door and was covered in blood. He was a dreadful sight. I just 
called for an ambulance.’

Yesterday there were still pools of 
blood at the scene. Mr Bennett, a father of one who lives nearby with 
his wife May, 56, and works for a roofing factory, had been at the home 
of his father-in-law Herbert Maiden, who died last year.

The family is selling the property and
it is believed Mr Bennett was collecting post when the carjackers 
jumped on him in the drive of the semi-detached house and tried to steal
his white Mercedes C220.

The attackers are both white. One wore
a red top and a balaclava, the other a pale blue top with striped 
sleeves and a high-peaked hat.

Detective Inspector Jon Keeley of 
Wigan CID said: ‘The horrific injuries the man sustained could easily 
have proved fatal, such was the ferocity of this attack.

‘He was stabbed 12 times just so these would-be thieves could steal his car.’

A man has been arrested and is being questioned by police on suspicion of attempted murder.
