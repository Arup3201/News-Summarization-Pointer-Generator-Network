This is the terrifying moment a helicopter crashes into the desert while filming a high-speed pursuit for the South Korean version of Top Gear.

The incredible smash took place during a segment of the hit show which pitted a Corvette ZR1 supercar against an AH1 Cobra chopper in a race.

But moments after the chequered flag falls, the unnamed pilot loses control, sending the helicopter into a tailspin.

War veteran: The AH-1 was the backbone of the United States Army's attack helicopter fleet until it was replaced and provided vital air support to ground forces in the Vietnam War

While the accident happened in March last year, Top Gear have only just released the footage.

The aircraft had been hovering at no more than 200ft when a mechanical failure forced it to the ground.

The AH-1 was the backbone of the United States Army's attack helicopter fleet until it was replaced by the AH-64 Apache in Army service.

Known for its high speed and maneuverability, it played a key role in supporting ground troops during both the Vietnam War in 1968 and Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm in the Gulf War between 1990 and 1991. It was retired from active service in 1999.
