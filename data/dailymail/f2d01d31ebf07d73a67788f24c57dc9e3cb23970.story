Back from the dead: Janina Kolkiewicz was declared dead after an examination by the family doctor in the eastern Polish town of Ostrow Lubelski

A 91-year-old woman has woken up in a body bag after being declared dead and kept in a morgue's cold storage room for 11 hours.

Janina Kolkiewicz was declared dead after an examination by the family doctor in the eastern Polish town of Ostrow Lubelski, and sent to a mortuary while her family planned her funeral.

But when the funeral home's staff opened the refrigerator to check on her body, they were shocked to find it moving inside the body bag.

They zipped it open to find Ms Kolkiewicz awake, complaining of feeling cold.

She has now returned to her family where she ate two pancakes and a bowl of hot soup to warm up, reported Polish newspaper Dziennik Wschodni.

Her ordeal began when her niece, Bogumila Kolkiewicz, called the family doctor, Dr Wieslawa Czyz, after noticing she was not breathing.

Upon finding no pulse, Dr Czyz declared her dead and wrote out her death certificate.

Her niece even began planning her funeral, which was set for two days later. 

Dr Czyz told the television channel TVP of his surprise at learning his patient was indeed alive.

'I was sure she was dead,' he said. 'I'm stunned, I don't understand what happened.'

'Her heart had stopped beating,' he added. 'She was no longer breathing.' 

Ms Kolkiewicz said she was feeling 'normal' and 'fine', though her niece said she had no idea quite how close to death she came.

My aunt has no inkling of what happened since she has late-stage dementia,' Bogumila told local media.

Police authorities have started an investigation into the ‘resurrection’ case.

It comes two days after Zachariah Kasagga, a fisherman in Uganda, also rose from the dead after being buried. However he died hours later in hospital.

And in May last year, Brighton Dama Zanthe, 34, ‘died’ after a long illness at home in Zimbabwe after a long illness. 

But as mourners filed past his open casket days later,  they noticed his legs were moving. He turned out to be very much alive and was immediately taken to hospital.
