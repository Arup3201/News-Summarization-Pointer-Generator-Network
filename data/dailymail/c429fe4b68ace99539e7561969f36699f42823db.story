Modern theme parks tend to be full of thrills and spills – but also havens of safety.

That enormous rollercoaster which whizzes you through seven or eight loops and leaves you dizzy has been tested to the final screw. Every dip and scream is fully controlled.

But things feel rather more free-form 
when you stand at the top of the SCAD Tower – a terrifying ride at the 
Tivoli Friheden theme park, in Aarhus, central Denmark.

Here, paying customers are suspended in a harness above a 30-metre (100ft) chasm – and then, simply, dropped – without any sort of wire or bungee rope.

Instead, they plummet, at speeds of 55mph – before landing in a waiting net below.

Am I really going to do this? A rider hangs in suspense as he prepares to drop from the SCAD Tower

Wait for it, mate: A terrifying plunge towards terra firma is just seconds away

Of course, there is nothing unsafe about the attraction – whose name translates as ‘Sky Tower’.

But for a tiny passage of time, as they plunge rapidly towards terra firma, riders have nothing to control their motion but the inevitable influence of gravity.

And we're off: The clasp is released, and the blink-and-you-miss-it descent begins

Certainly, you need plenty of courage to even think about making the jump.

Tivoli Friheden warns its guests that they are not allowed to try the SCAD Tower if they suffer from ‘back problems, heart problems, hypertension, epilepsy, fractures, open wounds and fear of heights', or are 'intoxicated by alcohol, medicine or other drugs'.

Perhaps obviously, pregnant women are also prohibited from riding.

It's a long way down from here, but not long to go: The speed of descent is clearly visible

Down down, deeper and down: The rider heads for the welcome embrace of the net below

The tower stands at a height of 40 metres, offering spectacular views of Aarhus and the surrounding countryside - assuming you have the nerve to take your hands from your face.

But there is a get-out clause.

Almost there: The rider reaches the end of his rapid encounter with gravity

Safe at last: The rider plummets successfully into the waiting net

Tremulous souls who want enjoy the view, but don’t want to throw themselves into the abyss, can take a lift to the platform, and then return to earth the slow way.

Those who are brave enough to leap are rewarded with a pin-badge that marks their achievements, and the kudos of becoming – according to Tivoli Friheden – ‘a member of a very exclusive circle of daredevils’.
