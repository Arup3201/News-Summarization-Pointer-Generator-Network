Families were conned out of millions of pounds in life savings after handing over cash for luxury seaview apartments in UAE to a 'shyster developer'.

At least 25 British buyers handed over up to £100,000 each to Iranian developer Frank Khoie, whose company was supposed to oversee the building of the properties.

Khoie, who defaulted on the United Arab Emirates deal despite more than 700 international buyers paying deposits worth £50million, was jailed in 2009 after a £9.5million cheque to purchase land for the La Hoya development bounced.

Among the British investors were Geoff Land, who lost £100,000, and pensioners Richard and Marilyn Chandlder, who lost £30,000 of savings that was meant for their retirement.

Mr Land, from Birmingham, planned on moving to the idyllic La Hoya Bay Residences apartment on the man-made island of Al Marjan on the northern cost of UAE with his wife, Alika, and children.

However after paying around £100,000 of their hard-earned money to Khoie, it became clear that the properties were not being built. 

They fought for their money to be returned after Khoie was jailed, but they are still waiting to be compensated by the developer - who was released from prison after just a year.

Mr Land, an IT consultant, was forced to start working in Saudi Arabia for four years because of the failed property deal, flying in from UAE on Mondays and only seeing his family at weekends.

He said: 'We have spent a lot of money trying to get this whole process sorted out. We realised it was not going to happen and we had to change track. We went to Saudi Arabia for four years, and had to re-save money.

'The flat has never been built. We were planning to stay there as a family.

Mr Land took legal action against Khoie Properties and is now waiting to be compensated. He was forced to work in Saudi Arabia for four years, hundreds of miles away from his family, to get by after the failed deal

'It would have been a dream place in many ways, business was good, it is not far from Dubai, the lifestyle is super, it doesn't drop below 18 degrees in winter.

'It was on the coast with mountains behind it. It is a great place to bring up kids right by the beach. Home to work would have been a short walk across the Plaza. It was a dream which was shattered.

Mr and Mrs Land moved to the Middle East in 2002 for work and, after having a child, decided to buy a home and settle down.

The La Hoya Bay property promised a swimming pool, a beach, restaurants, shopping outlets and a safe environment for Mr Land's family.

He paid £60,000 deposit and a further £35,000 in June 2008, but alarm bells started ringing when building work did not begin - just 15 months before construction was supposed to finish.

After four years of legal battles and commuting to and from Saudi Arabia, the Lands moved back to the UK in 2012.

At least 24 other British investors were left out of pocket, but they are finally set to be compensated over the next few months .

'I met Khoie several times. He was very gracious in the way he spoke to you, never aggressive. But the guy is just a shyster,' he claimed. 

A landmark legal victory by international legal services company Judicare Group cancelled sales agreements and ordered that deposits were repaid, but Mr Land, 55, says he still faces a wait for his money. 

He said: 'He has taken a lot of money from a lot of people, and he is still trying to do what he can to frustrate the legal system by stringing things out as long as he can.

'We have not got anything out of this yet, nothing is guaranteed. There is a mortgage on the land and it is protected until it is paid off. We are trying to unpick the legal process to get it sold off at auction.

'We do not know what the outcome is going to be, we hope that it turns out to be positive.'

'Looking back, Frank Khoie was selling a pyramid scheme. He has tainted the whole idyllic dream we once had of living in the UAE and we've had to completely change our life plans.

'The UAE legal system is expensive, arduous, slow and unresponsive and makes it so difficult for international investors.

'I would advise any property investor to steer clear of the country.' 

When Richard and Marilyn Chandler invested £30,000 in a luxury second-floor apartment at the La Hoya development in 2008, they thought they had set themselves up for a comfortable retirement.

The pair, who are now in their late sixties, wanted a place in Middle East to be nearer to their son, who lives in Dubai, so they and other other family and friends could visit  

But they, like the Lands, lost all of the money to Frank Khoie.

The La Hoya Bay property promised a swimming pool, a beach, restaurants, shopping outlets and a safe environment for families 

The pair, who are in their sixties, now live in Ramsgate, Kent - a far cry from their Middle East dream.

Mr Chandler, who was a tiler before he retired, said: 'It was supposed to be nice and secluded with a great view - it would've been perfect.

'We were going to pop out and use it as an investment and later roll it over and pay for the rest of our retirement.

'We are gutted. Everything seemed so legitimate. For that amount of people to lose so much money, it's just unthinkable.

'Some have paid more than £100,000 and some bought more than one property.

'The £30,000 was there and now it's gone. We didn't stop talking about it for so long.'

'It's difficult to put into words. We're gutted this so-called gentleman has lost us £30,000.'

Neil Heaney, chief executive of Judicare, said: 'Clearly the ruling is good news for our clients and is a warning to developers in the UAE who attempt to frustrate purchasers seeking reimbursement of invested monies for non-delivery of property, especially if they rely on an inaccurate Force Majeure argument.'

Frank Khoie could not be traced for comment.
