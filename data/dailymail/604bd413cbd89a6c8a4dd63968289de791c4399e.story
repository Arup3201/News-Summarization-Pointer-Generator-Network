Cancer survivors wanting to become parents have been given fresh hope after a record-breaking set of twins were born from eggs frozen 12 years ago.

Monica Zapotoczny, 45, of Buenos Aires, has given birth to the twins from the eggs she had frozen at the age of 33 - surpassing the previous record of seven years.

Mrs Zapotoczny and her husband 44-year-old Guillermo Husak, had thought that they would never have a child of their own after several failed attempts at IVF treatment.

The pair had one final attempt last year and Zapotoczny fell pregnant with non identical twins - Mercedes and Guadalupe, who were born in January by caesarian section.

Although eggs have been frozen for up to two decades, they are susceptible to becoming damage as they become more fragile the older they get.

As well as offering new hope to cancer survivors who are holding off having children, the news will come as a boost to career women who are having children later in life to focus on their job.

Zapotoczny said: 'It was a miracle. The joy we feel is indescribable, our family is complete. I hope other women who freeze their eggs can take hope from this that their dreams can one day come true.'

Around 1,000 babies have been born from frozen eggs worldwide with only 15 born in Britain in the last decade.

Fertility specialist Gillian Lockwood of, Midland  Fertility Services, recommended that women have their eggs frozen in their twenties and early thirties as the number of high quality eggs produced will be greater.

Lynne Featherstone, an international development minister who was in charge of equalities until September’s reshuffle, said childbirth was a ‘barrier’ to women’s career success, last week.
