Critics say the trend for adults buying breast milk cheapens its natural function and the bond between mother and child

China's super-rich are paying thousands of dollars a month for human breast milk, with some even choosing to be wet nursed.

The bizarre new trend has seen a rise in adults buying breast milk and drinking it either straight from the wet nurse or after it was expressed.

Newspaper reports on the service have provoked outrage in China with tens of thousands of people posting on Sina Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter.

According to the Southern Metropolis 
Daily, domestic staff agencies are offering wet nurses for newborns, 
sick people or anyone who will pay up to 16,000 yuan (Â£2,600) a month.

Customers say they want the concentrated nutrition breast milk provides.

It
has a unique combination of antibodies, living cells, enzymes, hormones
and fatty acids that has led some people to treat it as the latest 
superfood.

'Adult (clients)
can drink it directly through breastfeeding, or they can always drink 
it from a breast pump if they feel embarrassed', Lin Jun, owner of 
company Xinxinyu that offers the service, was quoted as saying by AFP.

Critics say the practice turns a mother's milk into a commodity and cheapens the bond between mother and child.

Chinese commentator Cao Baoyin wrote on his blog: 'This adds to China's problem of treating women as consumer goods and the moral degradation of China's rich', according to AFP.

Nine out of ten people said they disagreed with the practice on an online poll.

One user on Weibo called it 'disguised
pornography', while others said it was merely a form of novelty 
entertainment for China's super rich.

It is not only in China that has seen a rise in adults drinking breast milk.

China is not the only country that has seen a rise in breast milk for adults. In 2011, London outlet The Icreamists hit the headlines with its Baby Gaga dessert (pictured) made from human breast milk and served with a rusk

The first website offering breast milk for sale was launched in 2010 and it has steadily grown since then.

In the UK, as well as NHS registered breast milk banks for mothers who cannot breast feed their babies themselves, there are also women selling supplies to adults, who claim it helps with a variety of ailments.

In 2011, London outlet The Icreamists hit headlines around the world with their Baby Gaga ice-cream made from breast milk and served with a rusk.

Other countries take the supposed health benefits of breast milk very seriously.

Cancer patients, or those with digestive disorders or immune problems, can obtain breast milk on prescription in the U.S.

Trials are also underway in California for a breast milk acne cream.
