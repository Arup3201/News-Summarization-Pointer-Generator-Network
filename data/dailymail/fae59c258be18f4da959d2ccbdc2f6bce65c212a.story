He is best known for his appearances for England and Chelsea as a midfielder for almost a decade. 

But Dennis Wise attracted a different kind of attention when he appeared on television sporting an entirely new hair cut. 

Some compared his perfectly coiffured style to the slick 'do' sported by Lego characters.

Wise appeared on Setanta Sports on Saturday evening as a commentator to speak about the latest FA Cup games, which saw Chelsea and Manchester City crash out of the competition. 

However it was his hair rather than his comments that saw Twitter flooded with posts.

Some compared his appearance to that of Walter the Softy in the Beano, while others likened him to Montgomery Burns in The Simpsons. 

Mark Chapman, who presents Match of the Day 2, said: 'Dennis Wise appears to be turning into Kenneth Williams.' 

Twitter was awash with comments about Wise's hair, with some comparing him to the Beano's Walter Softy 

Others compared Wise to Montgomery Burns in The Simpsons, who also sports a distinctive style 

During the Capital One Cup in September 2013 Dennis Wise saluted away fans, with a very different hair style

And Mario Melchiot, a Dutch former footballer and former team mate of Wise, wrote: 'Dennis Wise is definitely stealing the haircut show on Twitter.' 

The 48-year-old had previously been seen with a receding hairline but his new hair-do seemed to be a completely different style.  

Wise's appearance saw a lot of Twitter posts go viral as people mocked up images of the footballer's hair
