An MI6 agent who managed to infiltrate al-Qaeda in a bid to kill one of its leaders was told by his British bosses they would not assassinate him because it could be against the law.

Terrorist Anwar al-Awlaki was encouraging attacks on the West and also recruiting young Muslims to carry them out but despite being able to murder him Morten Storm was blocked by London, it has emerged.

Storm says he was told by his bosses in the UK: 'We do not involve ourselves in encouraging people to participate in 
jihad and we don’t involve ourselves in killings abroad. Our objective 
is to gather intelligence.'

Claims: MI6 spy Morten Storm could have killed terrorist leader Anwar al-Awlaki but Britain said no, he says

British secret services then cut Storm off completely when he approached the Americans instead, he has claimed.

A source told the Daily Telegraph that no spy can kill anyone without permission from the Foreign Secretary.

Advice says 'Lethal
 force' can only be used in those circumstances in an 'emergency or 
crisis which causes danger to the UK or its citizens' - which means it 
has not been used for decades, the source added.

The CIA went on to assassinate al-Awlaki in a drone attack because he was known to have preached to the 9/11 hijackers and his videos were found across Britain in terrorist homes and in an extreme bookshop used by the 7/7 attackers.

Made for each other? Storm says he conducted an 
exchange of videos between Awlaki and Aminah, in which they talked about
 her becoming his third wife

Storm and al-Awlaki, who was a U.S. citizen and lived in the UK for two years, became so close 
he was offered $250,000 by the CIA to find a wife for Awlaki - who 
already had two - in an effort to track him down.

To do this, Storm turned to Facebook, and found 'Aminah' - who said she was a fan of Awlaki.

He then orchestrated an exchange of  video messages between the two, and - despite an assassination order on Awlaki from the U.S. - they agreed to marry.

But while successful in its early stages, the rest of the CIA's plot was thwarted.

Storm suffered a troubled childhood, drifting through drugs and into crime.

In 1997, the Dane said that he converted in prison to Islam and upon leaving moved to Yemen to study the Koran.

He added that in 2000 he married a Yemeni woman with whom he had a son named Osama.

It is understood in 2006, he had a 
dramatic and unexplained change of heart and was turned double agent by 
the Danish intelligence service, PET.

Dead: Anwar al-Awlaki (left and right) was killed in a
 drone attack in Yemen in September 2011 - Morten Storm claims it was 
directly helped by him

After five years, Storm claimed to 
have worked his way to the top of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's 
inner circle and gained direct access to al-Awlaki.

Awlaki, who was born in New Mexico, 
had become the lead figure for al-Qaeda and the offshoot al-Qaeda in the
 Arabian Peninsula in the years after Osama bin Laden went into hiding.

Before his death, he was believed to 
be responsible for persuading Nigerian terrorist Omar Farouk 
Abdulmuttalab to conceal explosives in his underwear which he tried to 
use to blow up a Detroit-bound plane on December 25th, 2009.

He also played a role in the 2009 
Fort Hood massacre and the failed plot by Faisal Shahzad to detonate an 
SUV filled with explosives on May 1, 2010.

The CIA plan he orchestrated, Morton says, was to 
plant a tracking device on Aminah's luggage when she came to Yemen to 
meet her new husband - which would lead the agency directly to Awlaki's 
hideout.

In a video appearing on the site of 
Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten, she said: 'I would go with him 
anywhere. I am 32 years old and I am ready for dangerous things. I’m not
 afraid of death or to die in the sake of Allah.'

Croatian Aminah, who used to work with disabled children in Zagreb, also adds: 'I feel nervous. This is very awkward for me. I just taped this so you can see how I look.'

Three peas in a pod? President Obama and Defense Secretary and former CIA boss Leon Panetta were allegedly aware of Morten Storm's existence

In his reply, Awlaki - who had specifically requested a white Muslim convert to be his 'companion in hiding' - said: 'If you can live in difficult conditions, do not mind loneliness and can live with restrictions on your communication with others, then that is great.'

He also mentions an associate, purported to be Storm, saying: 'The brother who is carrying this video is a trustworthy brother.'

The pair exchanged encrypted video messages, with Awlaki saying in one: 'I currently do not live in a tent, but in a house [that] belongs to a friend. I'm not leaving the house and am in a situation for my wife to be with me all the time. I prefer this residence [to] a tent in the mountains because it gives me ability to read, write and research.'

At a meeting in Vienna, Austria, Storm showed Aminah a video recording made by Awlaki, who was dressed in white robes in front of a pink background with a floral motif.

In it he says: 'This recording is done specifically for Sister Aminah at her request. I pray Allah guides to that which is best for you in this life and in the hereafter. And guides you to choose what is better for you regarding this proposal.'

Storm said Aminah burst into tears when after watching the video.
