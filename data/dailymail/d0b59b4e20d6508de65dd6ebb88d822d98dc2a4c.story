A dashboard camera captured the horrifying moment a valet smashes a £30,000 Ford Mustang into a concrete wall after he accidentally slammed his foot down on the accelerator rather than the brake.

The video shows the driver carefully negotiating his way into an underground parking lot in Dubai, when the car suddenly gains speed and crashes into the wall straight ahead.

The mustang's owner Antoine Adams, 43, says his 'dream car' is now crushed, with a broken engine, damaged front suspension and blood all over the interior from where the driver hit his face.

But Mr Adams, a Dutch expat who works for an oil and gas company, told 7 Days in Dubai that he bears no grudge towards the valet who drove his car into the wall.

'I don't blame the driver at all,' he said. 'He just made a mistake and I forgive him. He accidentally pressed the gas pedal instead of the brake.'

He added: 'My wife was a bit upset at first but then I told her not to worry about materialistic things and that the driver's safety was more important.'

The valet was taken to hospital with injuries to his face, but has since been released and is now recovering.

The car suffered extensive damage to its front, which the valet service has promised to pay for

The manager of the valet service,  who was named just as Ibrahim, said the driver is doing 'okay' and suffered just 'minor injuries'.

'We have had accidents with our valet drivers before – but nothing as big as this,' he added.

The manager said the company's insurance will repair all the damage to Mr Adams' car, no matter how extensive.

He said: 'We will take care of all the damage. And we will give him a car to use in the meanwhile. If he wants a Lamborghini or Ferrari, we will give it to him. He can keep it until he's satisfied.'

Ibrahim went on to say that Mr Adams was a 'complete gentleman' when he found out about his mangled car.

'He [Adams] was more concerned about the driver's life than materialistic things,' he said.
