A family have thanked their pet cat after escaping from a house blaze with just seconds to spare.

Caroline Noble, 30, her husband, Adi, 29, and their three children had been fast asleep when their fridge freezer burst into flames.

The blaze tore through their home but their fire alarm failed to go off - despite being tested just two weeks before.

It wasn't until their seven-year-old Bengal cat Simba started to repeatedly meow that Mrs Noble woke up to find smoke billowing through her home.

The full-time mother was able to gather her family and flee the property - just seconds before it was gutted by the flames.

Mrs Noble said she would not be here now to tell the tale if it wasn't for her loveable pet cat.

The mother-of-three, from Sudbury, Suffolk, said: 'We owe our lives to our cat. It was just before 6am and we were all in bed.

'When he woke me I couldn't see anything because there was so much smoke. I don't think we would have survived.

'It was like a sauna, it was so hot. When we got down the stairs it was literally blazing.

'If we were in there even a few more seconds more than I don't think we would have got out. He really did save our lives.

'When you realise how close it actually was, when you wake up and can't see, and take that first breath and taste the smoke, that split second feels like a lifetime.'

Mrs Noble has also thanked the local community who have since donated clothes, toys and cash to help them get back on their feet.

She, tattooist Adi and children Charlie, nine, Kyla-Mai, seven, and Kayden-Rayce, four, have since moved in to a new property while their old home is repaired.

They lost all their other possessions in the fire after escaping with nothing more than the nightclothes they were wearing.

Mrs Noble added: 'The whole community has been wonderful.

'People have given us clothes and cash, persuaded shops to donate things, and bought toys for the children including teddy bears to help them sleep.

'Adi's customers have been brilliant too. I just want to say thank you so much to everyone who has helped us.'
