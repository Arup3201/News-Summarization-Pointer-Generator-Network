These hilarious photos show how everyday objects can be turned into friendly faces with the simple addition of a pair of stick-on googly eyes.

The craze, known as 'eyebombing', is considered by fans to be an easy way of brightening up the world around them.

And two visionary Danish designers have set up a website for eyebombers across the world to share images of themselves joining in with the craze.

Smiling: Two Danish designers who set up a website dedicated to eyebombing say they want to make the world a cheerier place for all their users

Eyebombing has been going on for years, thanks to the comic potential of applying googly eyes to objects such as postboxes, drainpipes and bins.

But more recently Peter Dam and Kim Nielsen decided to celebrate the practice with their site, Eyebombing.com, whose motto is: 'Humanising the world, one google eye at a time.'

They have imposed two strict rules on wannabe eyebombers - the eyes can only be put on inanimate objects, and it must be done in a public place.

Dignified: Fans say the practice shows almost any inanimate object can be turned into a face

What's going on? The comic craze has been cheering up web users for several years now

While the practice may seem frivolous and silly, the website's founders insist they have an important purpose in helping to cheer up the whole world.

'The goal is simple - it is just to bring more chuckles, smiles and laughs to the world,' the pair told BBC News.

'It gives us the opportunity to create a smile in people's very busy lives.'

Some may compare eyebombing to graffiti, but Mr Dam and Mr Nielsen say that because it is anonymous it is far more selfless than painting your own name on the side of a building.

'Graffiti and tagging are all about you,' they said. 'Eyebombing is only about giving something to others.'

In addition, they insist that fans should only use removable sticky eyes, rather than gluing them on, so that they do not do any damage.

Subtle: Eyebombing can often be a particularly unobtrusive form of public artwork
