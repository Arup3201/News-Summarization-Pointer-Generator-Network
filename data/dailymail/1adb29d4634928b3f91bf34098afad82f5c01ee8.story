Ever wanted to eat whatever you want without worrying about calories? It may sound too good to be true but if one man has his way, this could be the future of food.

Project Nourished is a  gastronomic virtual reality experiment using Oculus Rift headsets, cutlery with sensors, low-calorie foods and aromatic diffusers to mimic the taste of the real thing.

If the experiment proves successful, being prevented from eating whatever you like due to food allergies and dietary restrictions will become a thing of the past.

The brainchild of Los-Angeles based Kokiri Lab, the project was inspired by a scene in the film Hook, in which Peter Pan learns to use his imagination to see food on a table that appears empty at first.

So successful have experiments been, Jinsoo An, 30, the founder of Kokiri Lab believes Project Nourished could pioneer a new way of eating.

‘I've been disappointed by the fact that our way of eating hasn't changed much since the beginning of time and I wanted others to realise that they don't have to follow the status quo,’ he told MailOnline.

‘I also want to make it clear that I don't want this to replace the way we consume food. It's simply another alternative.’

An alternative to the way we eat, Project Nourished will let you eat wherever you want to, be it in the middle of a desert (pictured) or standing in the street of a bustling city full of people and moving objects

Currently in its early stages, the experiment is a complete sensory experience that uses virtual reality headsets and special cutlery with sensors to create environments based on real locations.

This is then combined with low-calorie foods derived from agar, konjac jelly and gum Arabic, which mimic foods such as steak, lasagne, pies and sushi.

Aromatic diffusions also come into play, making it possible to smell your virtual steak before you tuck into it.

‘We've began prototyping the object detection sensor for chopsticks and fork, as well as the virtual reality software using Unity and Oculus Rift,’ Mr An explained.

‘Our first demo will feature an environment based a fictional place that is set in the past and future of Tokyo. You'll be able to eat in the middle of the bustling city full of people and moving objects.

‘We've also been experimenting with water to agar ratio and layering thin sheets of agar (like lasagna) to achieve different textures of the virtual foods.’

On the menu and currently being trialled are dishes such as sushi, steak, lasagne and pie.

‘So far, we've been focusing our efforts on sushi, steak, lasagna and pie since they have relatively simple geometry and large flat surface areas -- which means they're easier to detect using our sensors,’ Mr An continued.

‘The foods that have irregular shapes, have many chunks and fall apart easily will be the hardest to mimic.

'Most likely, we will stay away from foods like rice pudding, sweet and sour chicken, and salad.’

He hopes to begin further testing later this year.

‘We expect to have our first alpha sometime in the middle of the year. If we can get more funding soon, we can probably have it sooner. 

'Currently, I'm funding it out of my own pocket, so there are some challenges.’
