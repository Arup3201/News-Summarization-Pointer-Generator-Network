The unidentified remains of those killed at the World Trade Center have returned to the World Trade Center site in a solemn procession on a foggy Saturday morning.

The remains were moved from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner on Manhattan's East Side at dawn Saturday, accompanied by police and fire department vehicles with lights flashing but no sirens.

The remains will be transferred to an underground repository in the same building as the National September 11 Memorial Museum.

Procession: The remains were accompanied by police and fire department vehicles with lights flashing but no sirens

New resting place: The remains will now be stored in a special area of the memorial museum at the Ground Zero site which will still be run by the Office of the Medical Examiner

Reflective weather: The fog that settled over Manhattan this morning set the tone for the event

Holding out hope: Officials hope that improvements in technology will eventually lead to the identification of the 7,930 fragmentary remains

Paying respects: Firefighters stand to attention as the emergency vehicles transport the remains to Ground Zero

Like many decisions involving the site of the nation's worst terrorist attack, the disposition of the unidentified remains has been contentious.

A group of victims' family members who say the remains should be stored in an above-ground monument separate from the museum protested Saturday's procession.

About a dozen wore black bands over their mouths at the site Saturday.

'Don't put them in the basement!' Rosemary Cain, who lost her firefighter son at the trade center, said Thursday.

What remains: Rosaleen Tallon, whose brother Sean died in the Towers, has been fighting for the rights of the victim's families for years

Standing their ground: Some of the relatives of the victims whose remains have not yet been identified protested the decision to move the remains

Protest: The relatives take issue with the remains being in a museum and so they were waiting for the delivery on Saturday morning to make their protest

Still fresh: Iliana Flores (left) and her mother Ilia Rodriguez (right) lost Carlos Lilo, their brother and son respectively, in the terrorist attack and his remains are among those that remain unidentified

'Give them respect so 3,000 souls can rest in peace!'

Other family members support the plans, which have been in the works for years

The repository will be available for family visits but will be overseen by the medical examiner.

Officials hope that improvements in technology will eventually lead to the identification of the 7,930 fragmentary remains.

Making their statement: About a dozen protestors gathered on Saturday morning

Quiet: The protestors wore black scarves across their mouths, signifying how their voices aren't being heard

Controversy: Like many decisions involving the site of the nation's worst terrorist attack, the moving of the remains has been met with mixed responses from relatives
