A Christian blogger is at the centre of a free speech row after posting an 'offensive' advert on behalf of a petition against plans to legalise gay marriage.

Advertising watchdogs have demanded an explanation from the writer, known by the pen name Archbishop Cranmer, after they received 24 complaints.

The Advertising Standards Authority is asking that he respond to claims that the message - which asks viewers to 'Help us keep the true meaning of marriage' - is homophobic.

Offensive? A frame from the advert displayed on the Archbishop Cranmer blog, which attracted 24 complaints

    Archbishop Thomas Cranmer (pictured) was the man wrote and compiled the first two editions of the Book of Common Prayer.

He was also a reformist who helped build a favourable case for Henry VIII's divorce from Catherine of Aragon, which resulted in the English Church breaking away from the Vatican.

Cranmer was tried for treason and heresy after Mary I, a Roman Catholic, came to the throne.

Imprisoned for more than two years and under pressure from Church authorities, he made several recantations.

However, on the day of his execution, he withdrew these and died a heretic to Roman Catholics and a martyr to Protestants.

Archbishop Cranmer featured in Hilary Mantel's Man Booker Prize-winning novel Wolf Hall, a fictionalised account of the rise to power of Thomas Cromwell in the court of Henry VIII.

The Coalition for Marriage advert flickers between pictures of heterosexual couples on their wedding day, the phrase 'I do' and a message citing a market research poll that showed '70% of people say keep marriage as it is'.

The campaigners behind the petition describe themselves as 'an umbrella group of individuals and organisations in the UK that support traditional marriage and oppose any plans to redefine it'.

The ASA has stressed that the adverts, rather than the blogger, are the subject of their probe - and insist he is not compelled to justify the campaign message.

However, Archbishop Cranmer - who takes his pseudonym from a sixteenth-century reformer - remained adamant that the ASA is trying to restrict his and the Coalition for Marriage's right to free speech.

In a post attacking the anonymous complainants he wrote: 'They called in the Gestapo to censor the assertion that marriage is a life-long union between one man and one woman, in accordance with the teaching of the Established Church, the beliefs of its Supreme Governor, and the law of the land.'

Fellow ecclesiastical bloggers leapt to his defence and even the National Secular Society, which is in favour of legalising same-sex marriage, has stood by him.

A statement from the society read: 'The NSS wants to announce its support for the Archbishop Cranmer blog. Although it disagrees with this blogger profoundly on so many issues, it agrees with him entirely that the Advertising Standards Authority is overstepping the mark and posing a rather sinister threat to freedom of expression.'

Though the NSS went on to distance itself from Archbishop Cranmer and the Coalition for Marriage campaign, it argued the complaints made to the ASA were 'not reason enough to silence them'.

The ASA today stressed it would not necessarily uphold the complaints, which would lead to the ad being banned.

Probe: The Advertising Standards Authority is now investigating claims that the advert promotes homophobia

It said in a statement: 'The right of advertisers responsibly to express their views will undoubtedly be an important factor in our assessment of whether the ads are likely to cause serious or widespread offence.  We are also looking at whether the ads are misleading.'

The authority also responded to Archbishop Cranmer's outrage over the 'threatening' way in which it approached him, explaining that: 'We have long found it useful to ask, in confidence, publishers of ads subject to "offence" complaints for their views, because they can give us a valuable insight into whether or not their readers are likely to be offended'.

Of the 24 complaints said to have been lodged, ten took issue with the advert's allegedly offensive content.

The rest demanded evidence to back up the claim that seven in ten people do not want any change to marriage laws - but as this figure came from major polling agency ComRes, the ASA did not expect those who posted the advert to provide this.
