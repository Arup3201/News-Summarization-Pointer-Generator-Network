Social workers failed to respond to a call about possible abuse at the home of seven-year-old Roderick ‘RJ’ Arrington just hours before he was beaten to death, a report has claimed.

Officials with the Clark County School District said they placed a call to the child welfare hotline over concerns that Arrington was being abused at home but that social workers never responded to the school.

Instead, Arrington was allowed to go home, where later that night he is believed to have been severely beaten by his mother and stepfather and put into a coma from which he would not recover earlier this month.

Beaten to death for not reading the Bible: Roderick Arrington, seven, was covered in bruises and open wounds when he was brought unconscious to hospital in Las Vegas where he later died

School officials and members of the county’s Department of Family Services are now trying to determine whether more could have been done to save Arrington’s life, according to the Las Vegas Journal-Review.

It appears that faculty at Roudy Elementary, where Arrington attended, were clued into possible abuse after the boy appeared uncomfortable sitting in his chair and told his teacher that he had been spanked by his parents.

The school then followed its policy of alerting child welfare agents of any case where abuse may be involved. The Department of Family Services admitted that it received a call from the school on Nov. 28 and said in a statement that it is ‘conducting a complete review and investigation into this matter.’

‘That investigation will include a review of all policies and procedures related to the hotline and CPS and will consider whether those policies and procedures were appropriately followed in Roderick's case,’ the statement read. ‘No child should ever have to suffer the way Roderick did and the loss of any child's life is tragic.’

Tragic: Seven-year-old Roderick died in hospital after being admitted with brain swelling and covered in bruises

Markiece Palmer, 34, and Dina Palmer,
27, were charged with murder along with other counts of child
abuse and neglect. 

After the beating, Roderick
Arrington, seven, was taken to University Medical Center in Las Vegas unconscious and with massive brain swelling.

The
arrest report details extensive injuries, including bruising over 
Roderick's whole body and open wounds on his buttocks, allegedly from 
being beaten with a belt. The police report also revealed that Roderick 
was violently shaken by his stepfather. Arrington died the following
day.

Markiece Palmer told police he had 
spanked the child with a belt for lying about reading a Bible verse and failing to 
finish his homework. He said the boy then 'ran up on him' and attempted to hit him, at which he grabbed the boy and shook him.

Palmer said the boy then ran downstairs and slipped, hitting his head on the floor. After the fall, Palmer said he gave the boy a bath and put cocoa butter on his wounds.

When the little boy was found unresponsive the next morning, Dina Palmer called her pastor who advised her to dial 911.

Dina Palmer told police that she had repeatedly hit her son with a paddle and belt last month, what she described as 'whoopins'.

The couple admitted to police that they regularly beat the child for not reading the Bible or finishing his homework.
