Swimming great Ian Thorpe has just spent three weeks in an intensive care ward after being treated for an infection he caught while undergoing shoulder surgery. The 31-year-old, who has fought a well-documented battle with depression, is now expected to undergo rehabilitation and psychological treatment

The swimming great was spotted visiting an office in the Sydney suburb of Randwick.

Thorpe faces future shoulder operations and is also undergoing continuing treatment for his longtime battle with depression.

'He still has significant damage to his shoulder which will require further surgery,' his manager, Will Erskine told the MailOnline, 'but he's obviously very happy to get away from a hospital bed.'

Thorpe's relaxed and smiling demeanour was in contrast to the dazed and confused condition he was found in three months ago in a vehicle outside a suburban backyard in Sydney's west.

In early February, police were called by a Sydney family who thought someone had broken into their van.

They found a dishevelled and disoriented Thorpe, who it was later revealed thought he was sitting in a friend's car.

Thorpe's manager said at the time the swimmer had been taking antidepressants and medication for his shoulder.

Will Erskine said Thorpe is now looking forward to taking on media commitments in the UK and Australia.

''There's some exciting things he's going to immerse himself in,' he said. 'He's moving forward.

'Nothing is confirmed yet, but he had a wonderful stint working for the BBC in the London Olympics.

'He likes it over there. He likes the European way of life.'
