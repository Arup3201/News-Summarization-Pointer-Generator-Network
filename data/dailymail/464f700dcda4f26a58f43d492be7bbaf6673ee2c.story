Alan Barnes was left with sight and growth problems due to his mother contracting German measles during pregnancy. He now weighs just six stone and is 4ft 6in tall

A disabled 67-year-old who is just 4ft 6in tall was attacked by a cowardly thug who demanded money as he was putting his bins out.

Alan Barnes was born with sight and growth problems after his mother contracted German measles during pregnancy. He now weighs just six stone and is partially sighted.

He was the victim of a sickening attack outside his home in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear on Sunday night in a crime that has shocked his neighbours and relatives.

Frail Mr Barnes was pushing his bin from the back of his home to the front at around 6.30pm when he was targeted.

He was knocked to the ground, breaking his collar bone as he landed.

The mugger demanded money and searched Mr Barnes' pockets before realising his stricken victim was not carrying cash and fleeing.

Mr Barnes stumbled to the house next door where his neighbour called his sister Carol Hill, who rushed over and took her brother to hospital, where X-rays revealed the fractured collar bone.

Mr Barnes, a committed Christian, said: 'Someone just jumped on me. It all happened in a very short time. I would like to see him caught because he might do it again.

'I didn't see him coming. He must have jumped on me from a back garden.

'He pushed me down and put his hands in my pockets, then told me to give him my money, but I didn't have any.

'I shouted "help" and then he ran off. As soon as he had gone I got up, and I knew I had been hurt.'

Mr Barnes's broken collar-bone will take nearly two months to heal, in which time he will need special care.

He added: 'I'm just frustrated now that I can't do anything for myself. They say it will take four to six weeks for me to recover.

'I'm trying to do the best I can. I can manage to get a bath if someone puts the water in. But I can't tie my shoelaces.'

Ms Hill is furious that anyone would stoop so low as to attack her frail brother.

The 55-year-old said: 'The police seem to think it was a random opportunist attack. But they must have seen Alan as an easy target.

'I was furious. Whoever has done this has no morals at all to attack someone so vulnerable.'

Mr Barnes is well known in the area around his home and is an active member of the congregation at his local Methodist church. He fills his days taking long walks around the area.

He is known as a skilled mathematician and impresses youngsters by being able to quickly work out exactly how many days a person has been alive after finding out when they were born.

His sister believes he was targeted because he is an 'easy target'. Police are appealing for information

Mr Barnes is now too frightened to return to his home, and Ms Hill is helping her brother look for new accommodation.

Detectives hunting the would-be robber have branded the crime 'disgraceful'.

Det Con Chris Neil, of Gateshead CID, said: 'This was a cowardly assault on a vulnerable man who wasn't able to defend himself.

'His disability means he is partially sighted and quite short and it's disgraceful that someone would target him.

'The victim is quite a well-known man in the area and this has left him extremely distressed.

'We're doing everything we can to trace the suspect and I would urge anyone who saw this attempted robbery or who has information about the person responsible to get in touch.'

Locals have launched a fund to help Mr Barnes and have so far raised more than Â£1,400, which they plan to give to the pensioner to make his house more secure or to help him move home.

Anyone with any information should target Northumbria Police quoting log number 1180 25/01/15 or the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
