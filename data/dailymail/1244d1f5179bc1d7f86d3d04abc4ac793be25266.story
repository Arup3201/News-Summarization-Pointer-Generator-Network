An eastern Alabama school principal is asking students to bring cans of food such as corn and peas as a way of fighting off a school intruder.

W.F. Burns Middle School Principal Priscella Holley revealed the Valley school's enhanced intruder plan in a Friday letter to parents.

Holley wrote 'The procedure will be the same as we have done in the past with the addition of arming out students with a canned food item. We realize at first this may seem odd; however, it is a practice that would catch an intruder off-guard.'

New tactic: W.F. Burns Middle School Principal Priscella Holley is asking students to bring cans of food such as corn and peas as a way of fighting off a school intruder

Training: Both Auburn University and the middle school have adopted the ALICE program. A training video from the university shows students pelting an intruder with books after he 'shoots' a student  in a demonstraton

'The canned food item could stun the intruder or even knock him out until the police arrive,' she continued. 'The canned food item will give the students a sense of empowerment to protect themselves and will make them feel secure in case an intruder enters their classroom.'

The cans are set to be given to a food bank when the school year is over, Holler wrote.

The letter was sent after school employees received training from Auburn University's public safety department, Chambers County Schools Superintendent Kelli Hodge told The Associated Press.

Hodge said throwing cans or other items would be a last resort for students unable to evacuate. 

She said the cans would be stored in classrooms and students wouldn't be carrying them around school. 

Both Auburn University and the middle school are using the ALICE program, WRBL reported. The acronym represents the ideas Alert; Lockdown; Inform; Counter and Evacuate.

Speaking to Daily Mail Online in an email exchange, Hodge said  'We actually have received 0 calls from parents complaining. Certainly there was chatter on social media where the letter was taken out of context by individuals who did not understand or research ALICE.

'We had a parent meeting last night to explain ALICE and there were only about 15-20 parents present. Of those we have received several emails today for being proactive in the area of student safety.

The ALICE program's website says 'The purpose of ALERT is to notify as many people as possible within the danger zone that a potentially life threatening risk exists.

'The purpose of LOCKDOWN is to secure in place, and prepare to EVACUATE or COUNTER, if needed.

'The purpose of INFORM is to continue to communicate the intruder’s location in real time.

'The purpose of COUNTER is to interrupt the intruder and make it difficult or impossible to aim. This is a strategy of last resort.

'The purpose of EVACUATE is to remove yourself from the danger zone when it is safe to do so.

Both can-throwing and text-book throwing are considered 'Counter' elements, WBRL reported.

According to WHNT, the ALICE program meets the Department of Education's 2013 school safety guidelines published.
