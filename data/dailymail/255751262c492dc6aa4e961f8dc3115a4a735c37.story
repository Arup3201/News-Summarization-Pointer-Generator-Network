Napoli manager Rafa Benitez says England will be serious contenders to win the European Championships in France next summer.

Roy Hodgson's side beat Lithuania with ease on Friday night to keep up their 100 per cent record at the top of Group E and are six points clear of nearest rivals Slovenia at the halfway point in qualification.

England have been beaten by Italy at the last two major tournaments but Benitez, who has worked in Serie A for the past two seasons, insists English players are not inferior.

'I can see from outside that you have enough quality and enough potential to do well,'  the former Liverpool and Chelsea boss was quoted as saying in the Mirror.

'I am convinced you can do well. England will be contenders at Euro 2016 because of the level of the players.

'England have very good players – a lot of them could play in Serie A. It is just about finding a way that they can stick together.

'The understanding between them can be much better. But if you talk about potential, if you talk about quality, you have enough quality in England.'

Meanwhile, Benitez, who won the Champions League with Liverpool and Europa League with Chelsea, has backed Premier League clubs to bounce back from their disappointing campaigns in Europe this season, but claims Italian sides are tactically better.

For me it is cyclical - they will be there next year,' he said. 'Some European clubs are getting stronger, like PSG and Atletico Madrid, but the Premier League will be also stronger in the years to come.

England were also knocked out of Euro 2012 by the Italians on penalties

'The Italian clubs know how to compete, that is the reason why they progress in Europe this year. They are quite aware of the tactics. They work together with different tactics and different systems so they know what to do. 

'But I don't see England or the English players worse than them technically.

'Physically and technically they are at the same level. Tactically, obviously, the advantage of Italy is that they have been for years doing a tactical game.'
