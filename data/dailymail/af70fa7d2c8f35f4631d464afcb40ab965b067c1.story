A mum of two who donates her eggs for money, uses the cash she receives from the clinic to spoil her children- and even kit out her house with new carpets. 

Emma Frost, 25, has donated her eggs three times and received £2,250 for her efforts.

She's splurged the money on carpets for her home, a day trip for her two kids and revamps of their bedrooms.

And Emma is hoping to donate another seven times - the maximum allowed - for £750 a go.

The full-time mum, from Romford, East London, has used the cash to kit out her home but says she is happy to be helping other people experience the joy of motherhood and would donate her eggs even without the money.

She said: 'The money is a bonus and it allows me to give my children a beautiful home.

'I feel passionate that everyone gets the chance to be a parent and I love giving people that opportunity.'

Emma joined the fertility market when she considered acting as a surrogate for a friend of a friend struggling to conceive.

The first time Emma donated her eggs, she used the £750 to buy bunk beds (pictured) for her two kids

Having enjoyed being pregnant with daughter Bailey, six, but believing that she and partner Ben Hodgson were not going to have any more children of their own, she was keen to carry another baby, even if it was someone else's.

But just as she was about to offer her womb as a temporary home for someone else's child, she found herself pregnant again.

After giving birth to Mia, two, she decided that even if she was not going to carry another baby she could still help people realise the joy of parenthood.

Emma applied to be an egg donor and found out when she arrived that there was compensation for the ten days of injections and short procedure under anaesthetic.

In the last two years, she has donated eggs to three different woman who have all fallen pregnant. 

And with the money she has received as compensation, Emma has dramatically improved her house and treated her two children to the toys and outings she wouldn't otherwise be able to afford. 

After the first donation she decorated their bedrooms and bought the bunk beds they were desperate for, next she re-carpeted her house.

The last time she made the trip to the clinic and received the £750 in return, she took her family on a trip to London and put half away in an account for the girls to access when they are 18.

Emma said: 'I've changed the future of another family and I want to look out for my own children's futures too.

'At first I wanted to be a surrogate. I loved being pregnant and I had no complications - it was just a fantastic experience.

'Then I found out about egg donation and decided that, as I'd had another daughter by then, this was the thing for me.

'A couple of my friends have had trouble conceiving and the thought of being able to give something back was great.

'I got pregnant so easily I wanted to give someone the thing that I had.

'And being able to the do the renovations to the house and give the kids something is great.

'We took them on a big trip to London and they blew half of one of the payments on the day out which was fun. 

'Then the rest of that most recent payment I put away in an account for them which they can have when they are 18.

'I've lived with my partner for six years and although he was a bit shocked and worried about the risks at first, he's fully supported me.

'My family were just so proud - people were calling me up to congratulate me when I first did it.

'You can do it a maximum of ten times, which I'm going to do.

Emma wants to continue donating her eggs seven more times because she likes the feeling of helping other women out 

'I want to do it ten times because I love the feeling and the pride I get from helping another family have what I have.

'There are no bad points to donating eggs. You feel good about it and you give a family something they've always wished for.'

Dr Geetha Venkat, Director of the Clinic said: 'Egg donation is an amazing treatment.

'With women who want to donate their eggs, we go through all the implications of what it involves and then once their blood tests come back clear we go ahead with the treatment.

Emma, pictured with daughter Bailey, says she has also started to put money away for her daughters when they are 18 

'They have hormone injections for ten days which come in the form of a pen injection, so it's not difficult to administer. 

'Then they undergo a procedure called egg collection which is done under anaesthesia, absolutely free of pain.

'In 2012 the Human Fertilisation and Embryo Authority changed the regulations and allowed the egg donors to be paid a lump sum of £750 for their expenses and inconvenience.

'And because of this change we're able to get more donors and offer the services in this country.'
