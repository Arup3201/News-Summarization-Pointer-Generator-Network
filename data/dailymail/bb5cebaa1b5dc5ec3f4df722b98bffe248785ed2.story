Home helps must stay for at least half an hour with frail pensioners under new rules to end the scandal of ‘drive-by’ visits.

Updated guidance published yesterday insists that calls last for at least 30 minutes if they are offering personal care such as washing or dressing.

The advice, published by NHS spending watchdog NICE, said 15-minute drop-ins should only be considered in certain cases such as checking if someone has taken their medication.

In a sign of how bad things have become, guidelines have to spell out the care offered to the elderly – telling home helps to leave enough time to ‘talk to the person’. Care workers are also reminded to treat people with ‘empathy, courtesy, respect and in a dignified way’.

The move marks a victory for the Daily Mail, which has highlighted care visits lasting as little as five minutes as part of our Dignity for the Elderly campaign.

Last month a Mail investigation revealed that 70 per cent of councils are still allocating visits of just 15 minutes – with six authorities offering 200,000 slots of just five minutes. Some staff were even told not to chat because it wastes time, while visitors are sometimes poorly trained contractors or ill-suited to the job.

The guidance called on councils to ensure home care workers ‘have time to do their job without being rushed or compromising the dignity of the person who uses services’.

It also attempts to stamp out the conveyor belt culture under which pensioners can be seen by ten or 15 different carers in a fortnight, saying ‘continuity of care’ must be a priority.

Last night care minister Norman Lamb called on councils to adopt the guidance as soon as possible, saying that many authorities were ‘complicit’ in providing poor care.

However, the Local Government Association, which represents councils, said money was just too short to end 15-minute care visits once and for all. Chairman David Sparks said funding for adult social care is ‘in crisis’.

GPs are being urged to visit the elderly at least once a year to check they are not too cold, NICE guidance says. 

Meter readers could also check the temperature in pensioners’ homes and alert surgeries, it advises.
