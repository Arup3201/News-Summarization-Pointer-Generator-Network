Amazon is believed to be working on a phone with a glasses-free 3D screen for release in June.

According to reports in the Wall Street Journal, the device will use retina-tracking technology to make images on the smartphone's display appear to 'float above the screen like a hologram and appear three-dimensional at all angles.'

The handset will be revealed in June and launched in September, the report claims.

Following Amazon's foray into the tablet market with the Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD - being shown off here by CEO Jeff Bezo - the company is said to now be working on a smartphone with a 3D screen

Amazon's most reent launch was the Fire TV box. It features:

Quad-Core Processor and Graphics Engine

2GB of memory, 4x the memory of Apple TV

Streams in High Definition 1080p with Dolby Digital Plus Surround Sound

Box is 0.7” thin

Fire TV’s remote uses bluetooth

Voice search using microphone on remote

Average price of paid games is $1.85

This would pit it directly against Apple's upcoming iPhone 6, which is also expected to go on sale in September.

KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also believes the firm will launch a phone.

'We predict Amazon (US) will launch its own brand smartphone in 3-6 months, using the same hardware strategy as used for its e-reader and tablet,' he recently wrote.

'The supply chain will start stocking up materials in Q2 2014 for production.'

It comes just weeks after the firm launched Fire TV, a set top box that doubles as a games console.

The box allows users to download films and TV shows, along with apps.To play games, users can use a remote, or buy a separate game controller for $40.Mike Frazzini from Amazon Games said each game will be priced like a phone app, costing on average $2.

Games available at launch will include Minecraft, driving game Asphalt 8 and first person shooter Sev Zero, created by the games studio double Helix Microsoft bought recently.

Peter Larsen from Amazon said the firm wanted to 'invent and simplify' with the box.

'It's incredibly powerful, and it's unbelievably simple,' he said.

The move would pit Amazon in a battle with Google and Apple, which is expected to unveil its latest iPhone in September

'Tiny box, huge specs, tons of content, incredible price—people are going to love Fire TV,” said Jeff Bezos, Amazon.com Founder and CEO.

The service uses Amazon's existing Prime TV and film on demand service, along with Hulu Plus.

The gadget, costing $99, is aimed squarely at Amazon and Roku's products along with google's Chromecast.

The firm said it plans to add more services in the future.

Amazon already offers on-demand TV shows and movies free to customers who are members of Amazon's premium shipping service Prime, in both the UK and US.

Speculation about Amazon smartphones began in 2011.
