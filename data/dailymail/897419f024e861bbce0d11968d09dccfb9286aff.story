Scientists now say it's the time you spend walking rather than the speed you go which matters

The health benefits of going for a walk have long been recognised.

And now scientists say it’s the time you spend rather than the speed you go.

They found that doing at least one to two hours a day was associated with reduced stroke risk in the over-60s.

But strenuous ‘power walks’ were not required. 

Some 3,435 healthy men aged 60 to 80 were questioned about the distance they walked each week and their usual pace.

The study showed that those who went for eight to 14 hours a week were a third less likely to have a stroke than those who walked less than three hours.

For men walking more than 22 hours a week, the risk was two thirds lower, according to the study published in the American Heart Association journal Stroke.

‘If you took 1,000 men who usually walk eight to 14 hours per week and followed them for ten years, on average they would have 55 strokes, compared with 80 for the group who only walk zero to three hours a week,’ said researcher Dr Barbara Jefferis of University College London.

‘The total time spent walking was more consistently protective against stroke than pace; overall it seemed that accumulating more time walking was most beneficial. 

Our findings suggest that regular walking could be an important part of stroke prevention strategies in older people.’

Teams found that doing at least one to two hours a day was associated with reduced stroke risk in the over-60s. But strenuous 'power walks' were not required

Each year around 152,000 people have strokes in the UK, which can be fatal or disabling.

Dr Shannon Amoils, from the British Heart Foundation, which part-funded the study, said: 'Whatever your age it’s important to stay active every day. 

‘This research suggests a daily walk could help to reduce stroke risk and is further evidence that regular exercise – even a daily stroll in the park – can be an effective way to keep healthy.’
