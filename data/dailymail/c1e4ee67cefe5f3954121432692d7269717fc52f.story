Cardiff City have started High Court proceedings to reclaim more than £50,000 they paid to football agent Paul Atkin for information he provided about discredited former manager Malky Mackay.

It’s claimed Atkin, of Pro Star Management, made an approach to Cardiff under the pseudonym Jack Anonymous offering to help the club defend Mackay’s £7million employment claim with ‘two significant pieces of information’ regarding his alleged ‘serious misconduct’.

Mackay later settled with the club before Sportsmail revealed the series of racist, homophobic and sexist texts he had exchanged with director of football Iain Moody. Neither has yet found another job in football.

Cardiff paid Atkin, via his solicitor, £51,500 for the information he had been touting. But on receiving it, they found it ran to less than one typed page and was either of questionable accuracy or relevance.

The first item was that Norwich majority shareholder Delia Smith had allegedly approached Mackay about managing the Canaries and the second was that Atkin’s own agency had a scouting agreement with Mackay through his agent Raymond Sparkes, who also works for Pro Star Management.

The Welsh club, whose owner Vincent Tan has spent £750,000 investigating eight transfers during Mackay’s tenure, are seeking the return of their money plus legal costs.

A new gambling law involving the licensing of online betting companies that came into effect on Saturday will have Premier League clubs examining any sponsorships involving the gaming sector. It will soon be illegal for any non-registered betting operation with UK interests to advertise on the back of shirts or on perimeter boards. A Premier League spokesman said: ‘Our clubs have been made aware of these new regulations well in advance.’

It doesn’t say much for Michael Owen’s commitment as a BT Sport co-commentator that he missed last Saturday’s Premier League match between two of his old clubs, Liverpool and Newcastle, to travel to the United States to watch his horse Brown Panther run in the Breeders’ Cup meeting. This isn’t the first time Owen has put his horse racing passion ahead of TV football duties.

Hot on the heels of Mark Clattenburg’s one-match ban for not using the official referees’ transport after West Brom v Crystal Palace, it is alleged that Lucy May, girlfriend of Michael Oliver, bagged a lift in the officials-only people carrier after Burnley played Chelsea. The Professional Game Match Officials said they don’t comment on individual incidents.

Military manoeuvred

There is some disquiet among fans that four of the clubs — Portsmouth v Aldershot and Gosport v Colchester — whose FA Cup first-round matches have been moved to November 9, Remembrance Sunday, are from military or naval towns. An FA spokesman said there had been no complaints from the teams involved and that there would be appropriate recognition of the date at both venues

Celtic are considering complaining to Ofcom about Sky Sports News using footage of Stefan Scepovic instead of team-mate Aleksandar Tonev when the latter was banned for seven matches for racist behaviour. The club consider the on-air apology was not made quickly enough. Sky say they apologised as soon as they were made aware of the error.

FA National Game chief Roger Burden has slammed Sport England for the way they measure participation in team games. This follows the FA being docked £1.6million of their grassroots grant from the funding agency after a drop in football participation.

Burden wrote in a letter to FA councillors: ‘Sport England’s way of measuring sports activity leaves a lot to be desired and does not properly recognise team sports or those who don’t play football every week, but still play regularly. Most team sports have similar criticisms.’

Sport England said: ‘We talk to the FA regularly about how we monitor their performance and are confident the Active People Survey is fully understood.
