Recruit: Private Cheryl James, 18, died from a gunshot at Deepcut barracks

The family of a young Army recruit who died from a single gunshot wound at Deepcut Barracks last night won a dramatic breakthrough in their 19-year battle for justice.

The Attorney General, Dominic Grieve, gave consent for the parents of Cheryl James, 18, to seek a new inquest after secret police evidence emerged.

The move is almost certain to lead to new public hearings into what happened at the notorious barracks in Surrey, where three other soldiers died in mysterious circumstances between 1995 and 2002.

Privates Geoff Gray, 17, Sean Benton, 20, and James Collinson, 17, also died from gunshot wounds, sparking allegations of bullying and abuse.

The families have refused to accept the theory that all four soldiers committed suicide using their own rifles and have accused the Army of a cover-up.

Des and Doreen James, Cheryl's parents, said: 'It's truly an emotional day - it's been a long and painful process, with so many hurdles, but we never considered giving up.

'Cheryl had her whole life in front of her. When our young people lose their lives serving their country, not only do they deserve a full and independent investigation into their deaths, it must be their absolute right.'

Cheryl was found dead from a single bullet wound to her head outside the notorious base in Surrey in November 1995.

Surrey Police handed the matter over to the Army and her death was immediately treated as suicide, despite previous descriptions of her as 'bubbly' and 'happy'.

Liberty, which is representing Cheryl's family, said the original inquest lasted just an hour.

The civil liberties group said key witnesses weren't called, medical records went uninspected and important evidence was ignored. An 'open' verdict was recorded.

Concerns about the string of tragedies at Deepcut led Surrey Police to open an investigation in 2002.

Officers took hundreds of statements and instructed forensic experts but concluded there was no evidence anyone else was involved in the shootings.

Controversially, the police flatly refused to give Mr and Mrs James, from Llangollen, North Wales, access to the files.

Last year, Liberty threatened the force with legal action - prompting the police to finally cave in and hand over 44 volumes of files, including witness statements, documents, notes and photographs .

Some 70 per cent of the papers had never been seen before by Pte James' family.

It was this new evidence that persuaded Mr Grieve to grant the family permission to apply for the new inquest.

The request will now be formally considered by the High Court, but similar cases have ended in success.

Liberty Solicitor Emma Norton, who represents Cheryl's family, said: 'The Attorney General's decision gives Cheryl's grieving family a long-overdue chance to discover the truth.

'Until now their battle for answers has been repeatedly snubbed by a state that views the fundamental human rights of our troops as an optional extra.

'This young girl was preparing for a career in service - the least her family deserves is justice.'

The campaign group is planning to make a second application for an inquest on behalf of Sean Benton, who died in 1995.

Earlier this month a coroner ruled at a second inquest that a Royal Military policewoman Corporal Anne-Marie Ellement killed herself because of bullying and after an alleged rape.

The 30-year-old was tormented by fellow Red Caps after she accused two soldiers of attacking her during a drunken night out in Germany.

The hearing was a new inquest ordered after her family won a legal battle, also backed by Liberty.

An earlier inquest, which found she committed suicide in October 2011, did not hear any evidence about the rape allegations.

Last night a Ministry of Defence spokesman said: 'Our thoughts remain with the family and friends of Private Cheryl James.

'This decision is a matter for the Attorney General and the courts. If a new inquest is ordered, we will of course provide support to the coroner when needed.'

A fresh inquest can be ordered if there is evidence of fraud, irregularity of proceedings, insufficiency of inquiry or new evidence.
