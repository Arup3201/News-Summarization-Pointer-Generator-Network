For Mathieu Flamini  it was a moment of madness: he showed his studs and is set for a four-match ban. What a chump.

The consequence of his reckless challenge, when he launched himself two-footed at Morgan Schneiderlin 10 minutes from time, will hit Arsenal hard as he will miss League games against Crystal Palace, Liverpool and Manchester United and the FA Cup clash with Liverpool.

To do what he did to a fellow professional is disrespectful and dangerous.

When you play for a team chasing their 
first title since 2004  — and have served a ban for five bookings so 
receive a longer suspension for a dismissal — it is also rank stupidity.

Sadly, it also means Southampton's outstanding performance is of secondary importance.

Instead it felt as though Arsenal’s season could be shaped by Flamini’s dismissal.

The advantage has swung the way of their title rivals and Manuel Pellegrini’s Manchester City will go top if they beat Tottenham on Wednesday evening. Chelsea are also waiting in the wings.

Southampton played this game at full throttle, taking the lead when Jose Fonte converted Luke Shaw's teasing left wing cross.

To Arsenal's credit they recovered from a dreadful first half to level through Olivier Giroud and then went ahead with a delicious strike from Santi Cazorla. 

To see Arsenal panic as they did in the first half and for much of the second, when they were unable to put their foot on the ball, was extraordinary.

Mauricio Pochettino’s team were full of exuberance, feeding off the raw, rampant enthusiasm of Sam Gallagher in his first Premier League start.

At the age of just 18 he has the makings of a proper player, making life hell for Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny. The kid didn’t give them any rest.

To play as he did, against a team with the best defensive record in the Premier League, was something special.

Gallagher, pinched from Plymouth’s youth team two years ago, played because Rickie Lambert’s hamstring injury ruled him out.

He inspired Southampton’s opening charge, linking brilliantly with Lallana, Jay Rodriguez and the lung-busting runs of Calum Chambers down the right.

Wenger’s team were untidy, sluggish and sloppy; careless in possession as Southampton built up a head of steam.

Gallagher’s early strike drew a save from Wojciech Szczesny, flying to his right to tip the ball away for a corner. Game on.

Southampton took the lead in the 21st minute. Shaw put in the hard yards, buying some time and space down the left and his cross was met by the head of Fonte at the far post.

They could have been two up when Gallagher’s effort inside the six-yard box hit a post.

As half-time approached Wenger was desperate to get his team back down that tunnel and at the break he tweaked his system, encouraging his side to be more adventurous whenever they were in possession. It worked.

Within minutes of the restart they were level when Bacary Sagna, in an advanced position for the first time in the game, poked the ball into Giroud’s path.

The Arsenal forward improvised, turning Sagna’s ball beyond Artur Boruc for the equaliser. It was a special strike.

Southampton were stunned, conceding again
 when Cazorla’s sweetly struck effort on the edge of the area beat the 
Polish goalkeeper. It was a remarkable turnaround for Arsenal, but 
Southampton responded with an equaliser of their own after 54 minutes.

Tough night: Wenger says the red card was harsh on Flamini as Arsenal drew 2-2

Lallana read Jay Rodriguez’s cut-back and steered Southampton’s equaliser beyond Szczesny. It was a stunning response.

Arsenal
 poured forward for the  winner and Boruc looked beaten when  Cazorla’s 
chip was somehow deflected on to the top of the crossbar.

Szczesny 
rescued Arsenal again when he tipped Fonte’s effort around the post 
three minutes from time. It was another escape. Flamini, who will start 
his ban on Sunday against Palace, was nowhere near as lucky.
