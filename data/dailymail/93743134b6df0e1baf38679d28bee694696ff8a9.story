Finding a fiver in your pocket, sunshine and fresh bed sheets are among the little things in life that make us happiest, according to new research.

The survey of 2,000 adults reveals that finding money you didn't know you had is the ultimate mood-booster.

The sun shining and arriving at the till to find an item has been further reduced, getting something for free and getting into bed with fresh sheets completed the top five.

The research, for DoubleTree by Hilton, also showed sweet treats featuring heavily in the list, with chocolate, cookies and cake all among the Top 20 things that make Brits most happy.

Nearly two-thirds of those polled (62 per cent) have a sweet tooth and four out of 10 adults say a sweet treat lifts their mood.

Nearly a third (32 per cent) of adults admitted getting irritable if they're hungry or peckish.

More than half (52 per cent) say they have a 'glass half full' outlook on life, while 56 per cent describe themselves as particularly happy.

In the average week, a third of adults said they are 'truly happy' for 75 per cent of the time, while 27 per cent said three or four little things cheer them up.

Pleasant surprises provide us with the greatest moments of happiness with 82 per cent saying the best things in life are those you don't expect.

Dr. Glenn Williams, senior lecturer in psychology at Nottingham Trent University, said: 'It's vital for our health and well-being to experience positive emotions on a regular basis.

Sunshine came second, with supermarket reductions, fresh sheets, and freebies completing top five

'As this research shows, an effective route to happiness is not necessarily through experiencing major events that we might have planned out such as getting married, moving house, getting that all-important promotion, or even being on a holiday.

'Rather it is the small, and often unexpected, pleasures in life that can make us smile each and every day to help us build happier and more meaningful lives for ourselves and for others.'

The research marks the UK launch of DoubleTree by Hilton's global Cookie Care campaign, with thousands of pairs of chocolate chip cookies being given away across the country to unsuspecting passers-by - one to share and one to keep.

John Greenleaf, of DoubleTree by Hilton, said: 'It's clear that small acts of kindness are enormously powerful.'

Having a cup of tea and a biscuit came in at number 15, while someone making you a drink ranked 19th
