It was a foul-mouthed rant from former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd that no one was meant to see.

But his f-bomb laden tirade went viral in 2012 when someone stole footage of him losing it as he bungled lines for a recorded video message and uploaded it online.

Now three years on, it has been revealed Australian Federal Police spent 476 hours trying to narrow down suspects but they are still no closer to finding the culprit, ninemsn reports.

Australian Federal Police spent 476 hours trying to locate the person who stole footage of Kevin Rudd losing it as he bungled lines for a recorded video message and uploaded it online 

Documents obtained by ninemsn under the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act showed police interviewed 17 people and took statutory declarations from 27 others following the video leak.

The video was shot and edited in September 2009 by an assistant adviser in Mr Rudd's media team - Phil Fitzgerald - as the former PM was recording a message in Mandarin congratulating China on the 60th anniversary of the Communist Party.

It was recorded on a digital video cassette and was stored in the Prime Minister's office after the video was digitally edited and all files had been deleted from computers.

But after the footage was uploaded to YouTube by a user known as HappyVegemiteKR in February 2012, police started their investigations and found there were no digital files around containing the footage.

Despite an extensive investigation, Australian Federal Police have still not worked out who leaked the video

They found the footage could have only come from the cassette tape, but more than 100 people would have had access to it. 

FOI documents showed police came to the conclusion the tape had been lost when Mr Rudd's files were removed after Julia Gillard successfully overthrew him for the top job in 2010.

Attempts by police to locate the YouTube account holder also failed. 

Authorities could have tracked the account holder by gaining access to the geographic location in the computer's IP address, but Google - the owner of YouTube - refused the police request.

The IP address may have led police to a home address, or a public computer where they could have gone through CCTV footage to track down the culprit.

Police did not pursue this further as US authorities ruled they didn't have probable cause to make Google reveal its records. 

If the police had managed to locate the person responsible, they may have faced up to 10 years in jail as it was considered theft from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.
