Raheem Sterling has hinted that his long-term future remains at Liverpool after revealing that he dreams of hearing Anfield sing his name.

Sterling is stalling on a new £100,000-a-week contract offer, although he insists it has nothing to do with money and he will reassess at the end of the season.

The 20-year-old, who has been linked with a number of Europe's top clubs, has now revealed that he'd love his very own chant from the Liverpool faithful.

Sterling told Sunday Times Magazine: 'My ambition is to have my own song from the Kop. Last season I loved the song for Luis Suarez — [Steven] Gerrard and [Philippe] Coutinho have good ones too.

'Of course, when the crowd’s with you, there’s nothing better.'

Sterling will be hoping to help Liverpool to a crucial Premier League victory against Newcastle United on Monday evening as Brendan Rodgers' side look to close the gap to fourth-place Manchester City.

The former Queens Park Rangers youngster also revealed how a visit to Anfield as a starstruck 15-year-old convinced him that a career on Merseyside was the right move.  

He added: 'I was 15 when I signed to Liverpool’s youth team, and I have to admit I was starstruck. The first time I saw Stevie [Gerrard] I thought he was a fake! I couldn’t believe he was real and not a waxwork.

'By the time I was 14, I had trials lined up at Arsenal, Chelsea and Fulham, but my Liverpool trial at Anfield came first, and when I saw the stadium and the training ground, I thought: “Right, I’m not leaving here until I’ve signed.'
