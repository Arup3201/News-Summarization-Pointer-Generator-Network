The family of a Maryland man who was kidnapped by al-Qaeda two years ago have revealed their heartbreak at seeing him as 'a shell' of his former self in a newly-released video.

Warren Weinstein, 72, was seized by al-Qaeda forces in Pakistan, where he was working as an economic developer teaching locals how to farm, just hours before he was due to fly back to the U.S.

Two years since his kidnap in August 2011, a new video of Weinstein has been released by al-Qaeda, showing him begging for release and expressing his fears that he has been forgotten.

But his family has now insisted that they have never forgotten him and that they have continued to fight for his release - but that they simply do not know what to do to free him.

Plea: An image shows Warren Weinstein appealing to President Obama to 
negotiate his release in a video sent anonymously to reporters. The video of Weinstein was the first since 2 videos released in September 2012

Former life: In images before his capture, Weinstein looks far younger than
 in the newly-released video. He was working as an economic developer in
 Pakistan when he was kidnapped by al-Qaeda 2 years ago

'I wanted to die right there on the spot,' wife Elaine Weinstein told ABC News when describing watching the video. 'He has no idea how hard we've tried to get him back.

'But there's nothing to do to get him back, because they don't tell you what they really want. I'd like to think that somebody can rescue him.'

His daughter Jennifer Coakley said that telling her seven-year-old daughter that her grandfather had been kidnapped 'was one of the hardest things ever'.

She asked: 'It's my birthday coming up - is he going to be home for this one?' Coakley said.

'And how do you answer that for a kid?' she said. 'It's such a burden on them at such a young age to have to go through that.

'In my heart I know he's coming home and I
 try to tell them that, but it's just really hard for them to understand
 why this happened to him.'

His sister, Claire Ellen Weinstein, added that the video shows 'a shell' of her older brother and that it looks like he
 was 'coerced' to say the words in the video.

In
 the newly-released video, Weinstein says: 'Nine years ago, I came to 
Pakistan to help my government and I did so at a time when most 
Americans would not come here. And how, when I need my government, it 
seems I have been totally abandoned and forgotten.

'Needless
 to say, I've been suffering deep anxiety every part of every day, not 
knowing what is happening to my family and not knowing how they are and 
because I am not with them.'

He also appeals directly to President Obama for help.

'Mr. Obama, you're a family man,' he says. 'You understand the deep mental anxiety and anguish that I have been experiencing for these past more than two years.

'And therefore I'm appealing to you on a humanitarian basis, if nothing else, and asking that you take the necessary actions to expedite my release and my return to my family and to my country.'

Towards the end of the video, Weinstein says: 'I would like [my family] to know I love them very much and I think about each and every one of them every moment of every day of my captivity.'

It is the first contact from Weinstein
 in more than a year when al-Qaeda released a video in which he said he 
would be killed unless the U.S. government met his captors' demands.

Speaking out: Al-Qaida leader
 Ayman al-Zawahri issues a statement on the capture of Weinstein. He said Weinstein would be released if the U.S. 
stopped airstrikes in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen

The demands included releasing all prisoners from Guantanamo Bay and an end to all U.S. drone strikes in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen and elsewhere.

The new video was originally sent to 
Washington Post journalists who have worked in Afghanistan. An earlier 
video was released in May 2012.

Marie Harf, a State Department spokeswoman, later told the Washington Post that officials are 'working hard to authenticate' the video.
