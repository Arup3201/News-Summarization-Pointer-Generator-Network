One in five people who bought their council home in one of Britain’s wealthiest areas was receiving housing benefit when they applied, it has emerged.

The revelation centres on the London borough of Westminster, and comes after a Government watchdog warned fraudulent purchases under the Right to Buy scheme have increased 400 per cent in two years.

One fear is that hard-up tenants are being ‘gifted’ cash by private firms to buy their homes at a cut-price rate.

After buying a property, the company can then sell them on to private landlords for a profit, who will let them at market value.

In Westminster, 22 per cent of Right to Buy sales were to people in receipt of housing benefit when they applied, dropping to 11 per cent upon completion. 

It begs the question of how council tenants who qualify for housing benefit could suddenly afford to buy properties outright in one of the most expensive parts of the country.

Anyone who has more than £16,000 in savings is not eligible for housing benefit.

A report also found that 31 per cent of former council homes are now owned by private landlords and can be let for more than £800 a week in the capital’s second-most expensive borough.

Councillors have warned of a ‘property bonanza’ – and said many tenants claim the money was a gift from overseas, making it near impossible to trace. Last summer, it emerged that a property company had leafleted 60,000 council house tenants offering six-figure rewards for working with them to buy and then sell their homes.

Councillor Lindsey Hall, anti-fraud tsar for Tory-run Westminster, believes Right to Buy should stay

Nicholas Carlino, a director of London Investment Property Group, told an undercover Sunday Times reporter that he was making so much money snapping up homes that had been undervalued by the council and selling them on that he would ‘never have to work again’. The scheme was entirely legal.

Councillor Lindsey Hall, anti-fraud tsar for Tory-run Westminster, told BBC London’s Inside Out programme: ‘I passionately believe Right to Buy needs to stay, but it needs to be very tightly managed and not fuelling a property bonanza for individuals swanning around estates in grand Mercedes and BMWs.’

Labour-run Islington council said Right to Buy sales had risen from only a handful to more than 300 since tenants’ discounts were increased two years ago. In some cases, discounts now amount to more than £100,000.

Councillor James Murray told the programme: ‘It’s hard – we build them and then lose them via Right to Buy which then becomes buy to let.’ Right to Buy was first launched by Margaret Thatcher in 1980 to help council tenants get on the property ladder.

In March 2012, the Government announced it would ‘reinvigorate’ the policy, raising the cap on discounts and ensuring that new council homes were built. But an Audit Commission report last year found Right to Buy fraud had increased by more than 400 per cent since the reforms.

Westminster said it now refers all Right to Buy applications from tenants on housing benefit to be checked for fraud.

Inside Out London will air tonight at 7.30pm on BBC1.
