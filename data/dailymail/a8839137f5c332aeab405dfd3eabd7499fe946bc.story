Belgium's World Cup received a royal reception on their return home as Queen Mathilde and King Philippe met them at the Royal Palace in Brussels.

Marc Wilmots' side made it to the quarter-finals in Brazil, before being knocked out by a well-taken Gonzalo Higuain goal in a 1-0 defeat to Argentina.

The Red Devils were touted as 'dark horses' to win the trophy in the build-up to the tournament, to such an extent that their outright odds plummeted to 16-1, making them joint fifth-favourites.

Despite the excitement surrounding Belgium's 'golden generation', a number of their highest-profile players failed to shine on the world stage.

Eden Hazard, so impressive for Chelsea in the Premier League last season, was the chief offender, while his Stamford Bridge team-mate Romelu Lukaku also endured a difficult tournament.Â

Belgium won all three of their group games against Algeria, Russia and South Korea, and went on to beat USA 2-1 after extra-time in the last 16.

Their match against Argentina proved a step too far though, as Lionel Messi and his pals eased past Belgium and into the semi-finals.

Speaking after their exit, captain Vincent Kompany said: 'Obviously we are left with some disappointment but at the same time it's a young group. Four or five years ago we would never have dreamed of coming so far.

'I just have to say congratulations to the whole team. We will be a tough team to play against in the years to come.'
