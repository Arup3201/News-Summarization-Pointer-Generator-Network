An Aston Villa fan has revealed he was covered in blood after being struck on the head by a chair flung from the West Bromwich Albion section in scenes Kevin Phillips described as life-threatening.

Mark Villers was watching Villa’s 2-0 FA Cup win over their local rivals from the lower section of the North Stand when away supporters housed above began ripping out seats and throwing them down.

He told how he required treatment from Villa’s club doctor, who needed to cut his hair and glue the grisly wound on the top of his head closed.

‘It was mental,’ said Villers, 20, who attended the game with two friends. ‘We could see them throwing down the chairs after we scored the second so we walked down to by the advertising boards. We didn’t think they’d be able to reach.

‘All of a sudden, everyone shouted, “Duck” and stupidly I turned around. It literally hit me bang on the forehad, head on.

‘It was a shock but I didn’t think anything of it. I carried on cheering. Then I felt the blood pouring down my face. It was really bad. I’ve never bled that much. It was pouring out all over my clothes. It was a bad cut.

‘The pain wasn’t that bad, it was the shock of seeing blood come down my face. I knew it had hit me quite hard but I didn’t think it would cut me. It must have been caught by the sharp bit.

‘There were quite a lot of seats. After we scored the second goal things started flying down. To guess at the end it must have been 20 or 25. One landed on the pitch.

The fan's jeans and shoes were seen to be covered in claret after the trouble 

‘I didn’t need to go to hospital. I went to the stewards and they ushered me down the tunnel where the paramedics were. They held the tissue on and then the Villa doctor came, took me into the medical room, and glued it up for me.

‘He had to cut my hair unfortunately so I’ve got a bit of a bald patch. He cleaned me up and sent me on my way.

‘At least I got to go down the tunnel! I was sat down on a stretcher and saw Jack Grealish come through after he got sent off. Then I saw everyone going mad with the pitch invasion. 

‘The pitch invasion is bad but I don’t think it’s as bad as people throwing chairs.'

Speaking on Match of the Day, Phillips – who played for both West Brom and Villa during his playing career – said such actions could have been fatal.

‘Seeing those seats come down, it could kill someone,’ he said. ‘It was like the Seventies and Eighties again. Those people should be found and banned.’

Villers, a business development manager at a futsal centre, questioned why Villa organise the away seating in such a fashion for Cup matches.

‘Having the away fans above the home fans for Cup games is pretty stupid and is asking for trouble in my opinion,’ he said. ‘They should change that. One of the paramedics said a fan had been hit by a 50p piece.’

West Brom midfielder Craig Gardner also appeared to have coins thrown his direction when taking corners near Villa fans.
