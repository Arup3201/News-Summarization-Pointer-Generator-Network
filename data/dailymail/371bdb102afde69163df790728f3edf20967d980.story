They were the two teenagers whose low budget film catapulted them to worldwide fame.

Now, three decades on, the duo behind eighties classic Gregory’s Girl are living a somewhat quieter life, as a new documentary about their lives reveals.

John Gordon Sinclair and Clare Grogan, now both aged 50, became Hollywood stars after the unlikely success of their coming of age film set in the town of Cumbernauld.

Classic: Clare Grogan and John Gordon Sinclair in Gregory's Girl, released in 1981

Thirty years on: The actors will appear in a documentary, which sees them going back to Abronhill High school

Soon they were partying with Spandau Ballet and being transported from hotel to hotel in a limo – all at the age of just 18.

Speaking to the BBC, Grogan admitted they did not realise their luck in achieving instant success and said they ‘took it for granted’.

She said: ‘It was the naivety of youth and the arrogance of youth as well.

‘All you really felt like was that wee person from Glasgow. From the moment I left school my life was extraordinary.’

The documentary takes them back to Abronhill High, the school now earmarked for closure where director Bill Forsyth shot the film.

In the film, released in 1981, Gregory is infatuated with Dorothy (Dee Hepburn), the football team female striker, but it is Susan (Grogan) who is the girl he should be looking for.

Sinclair, who had been a member of the Glasgow Youth Theatre, was not sure about taking the role as he had started as a trainee apprentice electrician when Forsyth offered him the part of Gregory.

Grogan was working as a waitress, and was approached in a Glasgow restaurant by Forsyth who said he wanted her in his film.

By this time Grogan was also enjoying success with her band Altered Images, which led to a string of hits including Happy Birthday and I Could Be Happy.

The pair were living a superstar lifestyle hanging out with pop stars of the day such as Spandau Ballet and Wham.

As they grew older, they carried on acting but also turned to writing, with Sinclair publishing crime thrillers and Grogan composing children’s stories.

Grogan’s book, Tallulah and the Teen Stars, is written for her daughter Ellie to explain the joys and pitfalls of success.

She said: ‘I wanted to explain to 
Ellie that it was all right to have fantastic dreams and aim for them, 
as long as you recognise there is some work involved in that.’

Sinclair’s first novel Seventy Times Seven is a crime thriller set in Northern Ireland and America.

He added he likes writing as it allows him to ‘call all the shots’ like a director and ‘play all the characters’ like an actor.

Sinclair has also since won an Olivier award for the stage musical She Loves Me and starred in The Producers and made the Gregory’s Girl sequel in 1999.

Next year he can be seen in Brad Pitt’s World War Z, which was partly filmed in Glasgow.

Grogan, who appeared in shows such as Red Dwarf and EastEnders, will play the mother of Glasgow gangster in The Wee Man.

She says that after filming finished on Gregory’s Girl all those years ago she felt ‘bereft’ and ‘wanted to keep it going’.

Hepburn, meanwhile, went into broadcasting in Scotland, presenting It’s a Knockout and appearing in drama Crossroads.

When Clare Grogan Met John Gordon Sinclair was shown last night [Tues] on BBC Two Scotland and is available on iPlayer.
