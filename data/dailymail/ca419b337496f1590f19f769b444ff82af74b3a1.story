A man on the run after allegedly helping set fire to a Las Vegas pet store was arrested Friday in Crown Point, Indiana. 

On January 27, Kirk Bills was caught on surveillance cameras helping 35-year-old Gloria Lee torch her business, Prince and Princess pet shop, with 27 live puppies inside.

Luckily, firefighters responded in time to save all the puppies and they are now in the care of animal control.

Lee was arrested soon after the fire, but initially authorities had a hard time finding 27-year-old Bills.

They eventually tracking him down to Crown Point on Friday, the same day that a judge raised Lee's bail to $310,000 and took her into custody at the Clark County Detention Center.

Crown Point is about 50 miles south of Chicago, where Bills is from.

Bills works as a boxer for Super Judah Productions, run by Zab Judah - the former welterweight champion.

Three days before the fire, Bills lost a fight in California.

Pet store employees say Lee met Bills through Judah, and he was described as her boyfriend by prosecutors in court on Friday.

But Bills' former neighbor Raul Villareal told Fox 5 that Bills was married with kids when he lived across the street.

Bills and his family moved a few months ago after getting evicted.

He says police had showed up at the house on several occasions because of domestic disputes.

'There was just always violence over there. Violence carries on to somewhere else. People are desperate, times are hard, people are doing whatever to get money, you know,' Villareal said.

Bills was taken into custody at Lake County Jail and will be extradicted back to Las Vegas, though authorities haven't announced when that will happen.

Lee is due back in court on Tuesday for another hearing.

She made her first appearance in Clark County court last Wednesday, with a mob of animal rights activists protesting her alleged acts outside.

Lee and Bills each face 31 criminal charges including first-degree arson, conspiracy and burglary as well as 27 counts of attempted cruelty to animals - one count for each puppy that might have died.

If convicted, both stand to face decades in prison.

Surveillance footage shows the entire arson, and may be screened as soon as the first preliminary hearing.

In the video, Bills is seen carrying red gasoline cans when Lee lets him into the Prince and Princess pet shop around 1am on January 27.

Bills dumps the gasoline around the store and puppy kennels while Lee collects files from the office and takes out the empty gas canisters. 

The two leave through the back door after Bills lights newspapers and starts a fire spreading through the shop. 

Firefighters responded to the blaze in time to break in and rescue all 27 puppies inside.

The building incurred about $100,000 in damage. Firefighters credit the build's sprinkler system for keeping the blaze relatively contained.

Authorities haven't yet released a motive for the crime. The rescued puppies have since been placed in the care of the the Clark County animal shelter.

Confronted: One protester even snuck into the court to harass Lee and call her despicable, but was soon kicked out. Above, another of the many protesters

One of the protesters outside found their way into the court and harassed Lee, calling her despicable before being kicked out of the building.

'When you intentionally attempt to burn to death 27 puppies, what do you expect?' said Gina Greisen, head of Nevada Voters for Animals, an advocacy group, who is friends with the protester.

Lee is a three-time felon with convictions in California going back to 1999 for bank theft, forgery and escape. She also had criminal charges for improper animal care dropped in 2008.
