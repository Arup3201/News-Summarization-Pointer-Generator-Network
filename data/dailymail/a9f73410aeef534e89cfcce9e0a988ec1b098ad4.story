Mother's Day this year was a success for some, a letdown for others, and for many women across the U.S., such a disaster that it sent them into the arena of affairs.

AshleyMadison.com, the world's biggest cheating website, has revealed that 17,000 moms signed up to their site on Monday in hopes of hunting down extramarital liaisons.

That is over four times the number of a usual run-of-the-mill Monday, reports AshleyMadison - which boasts 26 million members worldwide and whose slogan is: 'Life is short. Have an affair.'

Letdown? AshleyMadison.com is the world's largest cheating website and claims 17,000 moms signed up to look for affairs straight after Mother's Day

'While Mother's Day might not have the implicit romance factor of Valentine's Day or an anniversary, it’s a holiday that compels women to reflect on their relationships,' founder Noel Biderman said in a press release.

'When expectations aren’t met, it can often be the last straw to trigger an affair.'

The site is free for women, with men required to fork out $49 for '20 connections' and on a typical day, 65 per cent of its members are men seeking a bit on the side. This figure flips the day after Mother's Day, with 65 per cent of new sign ups being women.

The only other momentous occasion which drives such a brigade of disgruntled and ill-intentioned women to the site is Valentine's Day.

Not just the men: Leann Rimes (left) admits to cheating on her then-husband Dean Sheremet in 2009 with Eddie Cibrian, and Kristen Stewart (right) had a scandalous affair with married director Rupert Sanderson in 2012

AshleyMadison sees in an average increase of 60 per cent in traffic on February 15 every year.

MailOnline spoke to New York relationship specialist Rachel Sussman, who isn't surprised by the statistics, but finds them concerning.

'Whenever we have high expectations, we are bound to be let down,' she says, adding that being disappointed can indeed trigger women to fantasize about being with someone else.

'Once upon a time, before AshleyMadison, we'd just fantasize or wonder. But today, anyone can go online, create a profile and turn a fantasy into a reality,' she reasoned. 'It's really, really dangerous.'

Sociologists have long been grappling with estimates for how common extra-marital affairs truly are, with results from various surveys indicating anywhere from 25 per cent to 75 per cent of married people admitting to being unfaithful.

that compels women to reflect on their relationships'

Admitting it being the key of course. Mr Biderman has said he 'guarantees' the figure is over 50 per cent, and at the helm of the second-biggest dating website in the world after Match.com, he is probably well placed to know.

The site, named after two of America's most popular girls names, for 'discretion' purposes, regularly releases statistics it has collected, including the fact that 64 per cent of women log on to the site on their phones while their husbands are in the same room.

Three to five years into a marriage is the most common time for a man or a woman to have an affair, and 22 per cent of American women admit to having no sex with their husbands at all.

As for a quick geography lesson, Los Angeles sees the most adulterers users, followed by Washington DC, with Kentucky seeing the least number of philanderers.

But next time a mediocre Mother's Day rolls around, Ms Sussman suggests being grateful that 
you are lucky enough to be part of a family, rather than focusing on 
feeling disappointed on a single day.

'Cheating is a poor band-aid and 
rarely leads to anything worthwhile,' she says.
