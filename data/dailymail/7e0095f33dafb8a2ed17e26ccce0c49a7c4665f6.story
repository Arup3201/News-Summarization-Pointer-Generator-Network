The original painting of the Chinese Girl, thought to be the most reproduced print in the world, was bought by billionaire British businessman and jeweller Laurence Graff for nearly £1million today.

Mr Graff, chairman of Graff Diamonds International, owns the Delaire Graff Estate near Stellenbosch, South Africa, where the picture will go on public display with the rest of his art collection.

The jeweller, who in 2010 spent a staggering $46million (£30million) on a 24.78-carat rare pink diamond, paid £982,050 - nearly double its expected price - for the painting.

The work by Siberian-born artist Vladimir Tretchikoff was part of a sale of South African art at Bonhams auction house.

Millions of reproductions of the picture, also known as the Green Lady because of the unusual blue-green skin tone of the subject, have been sold since it was painted in the 1950s.

A Bonhams spokesman said: 'It's very exciting. Suddenly the market has decided they like what they can see with Tretchikoff.'

Forbes magazine put Mr Graff’s net worth at $4.3billion (£2.8billion) this month, making him the eighth richest man in Britain and the 299th in the world.

A self-made tycoon, Mr Graff grew up in the East End of London and dropped out of school at age 14 to become a jeweller's apprentice, the magazine said.

The 74-year-old billionaire has more than 20 stores worldwide, including new outposts in Hong Kong, Gstaad and Dubai. The Sultan and Queen of Brunei, Oprah Winfrey and Donald Trump are listed as clients.

The sum is the highest ever paid for a work by Tretchikoff, who was born in Russia in 1913 but emigrated to South Africa after the Second World War, working for a period as a propaganda artist for the British Ministry of Information.

The familiar image of the woman, with her dark hair and bright red lips, has featured on T-shirts, mugs and posters.

The picture, which has been described as one of the most important pop culture images in Britain, was inspired by Monika Sing-Lee, who modelled for Tretchikoff after he spotted her at work in her uncle’s launderette in Cape Town, South Africa.

The Bonhams spokesman added: 'It's almost triple the £380,000 we sold his painting Lenka for last year.

'It shows he's beginning to close in on the other major figures on the South African art landscape, Irma Stern - whose picture Arab Priest we previously sold for £3million - and Pierneef.'

Pierneef's work Landscape, Stellenbosch sold for £713,250 and Stern's painting Congolese Beauty for £541,250 at the Bonhams auction today.

Tretchikoff, who painted with oils and watercolours, died in Cape Town in 2006 at the age of 92.

His work was often regarded as 'kitsch' during his lifetime, but Tretchikoff hated this categorisation and insisted he was a serious artist.

In 1991 he rejected a request to have his work on the front cover of a book on kitsch for this reason.

Tretchikoff's other notable works include Weeping Rose, Blue Monday, and The Dying Swan, which featured the dancer Alicia Markova.
