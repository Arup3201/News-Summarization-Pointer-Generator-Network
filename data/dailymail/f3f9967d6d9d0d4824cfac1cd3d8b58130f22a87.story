A taxi driver was tricked out of a fare  by two passengers who left a fully clothed mannequin in the car for the final leg of the journey - and promised their 'sleeping' friend would settle the bill.

The driver, known only as 'Stutter', was hailed for a late-night journey from Brighton train station to London by three men who agreed on a fee.

They all got into the cab and headed up to the capital but one of the passengers was said to be 'sleeping'. The driver dropped the first man off before heading to the second person's home.

The unnamed taxi driver was duped by two men who carried a mannequin (file picture), fully clothed and wearing a hat, into the cab

Upon arrival, the second man got out, thanked the driver and gave the address of their friend in the back seat and asked him to wake him up when he got to his house.

The driver then arrived at the last address and tried to wake the person up to let them know he was home - but realised it was a fully-clothed mannequin.

Andy Cheesman, CityCabs boss in Brighton, East Sussex, said: 'Three people got into a cab at Brighton train station.

'It was about 2am in the morning and they asked to be taken to London and agreed a fee with the driver.

'When they got to London the first one got out then asked for his friends to be dropped off at a second address.

'When he got to the second address the guy got out and said "my mate is still asleep, can you take him to his address, please".

The driver dropped the first two passengers home and was given the address of the third 'man', and told to wake him upon arrival where he would settle the fare

'When he got there the driver couldn't wake him up to start with, then he realised it was a fully-clothed mannequin wearing a hat.

'He was expecting the last passenger to pay the fare so he lost the whole lot. It would have probably been around Â£140.

'It has been the funniest thing which has happened to one of our drivers. You can imagine the stick the driver got from the other workers when he got back to Brighton - it was hilarious.'
