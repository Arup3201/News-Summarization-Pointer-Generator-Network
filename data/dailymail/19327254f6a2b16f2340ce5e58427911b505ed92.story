More than 400 war heroes, army generals and rank-and-file soldiers have issued a plea to Scottish voters warning that independence would leave Britain's defences ‘irresponsibly weakened’.

The former servicemen and women - who are all eligible to vote - have signed a statement entitled ‘We are stronger when we stand together’ urging Scots to vote against separation on Thursday.

The signatories boast a who’s who of Scotland’s military history over the last seventy years, including six former heads of the Army in Scotland and the two WW2 veterans who helped sink the Bismark and its sister ship the Tirpitz - Lt Cdr Jock Moffat and Lt Cdr John Lorimer.

In the statement, the veterans warn voters that the only way to safeguard Scotland’s interests in the future is to vote against independence.

They said: ‘As former members of the Royal Navy, British Army and Royal Air Force who are proud to call Scotland our home, we passionately believe that the people of Scotland will be stronger and more secure if we remain part of the United Kingdom.

‘We are in no doubt that were Scotland to break away from the United Kingdom the current arrangements for defending all these islands would be irresponsibly weakened.’

‘We recognise that when deciding which way to vote we will all be influenced by many different factors. However in defence terms there is no question about it. We are a great deal better together.’

The statement also expressed concern over the SNP’s plans to set up a separate Scottish Defence Force with a budget of just £2.5billion a year.

‘We see no evidence that the SNP’s proposals for the defence and security of an independent Scotland could possibly provide us with a credible, effective defence force capable of securing the interests of Scotland and our people.

‘Britain’s armed forces represent a potent safeguard against those who mean us harm.’

It adds that Scotland stands to lose thousands of highly-skilled and high-value jobs in the wider defence industry, while Britain’s military would continue to offer ‘challenging and rewarding careers’ for many Scots if the union remains intact.

‘We are very proud of the remarkable contribution that Scots men and women have made to the Armed Forces and the important and integral part we have played in preserving our nation’s freedom and safeguarding our interests.’

One signatory, Captain Frankie Caldwell of the Royal Tank Regiment, who left the army in 2010 after 27 years, added: ‘I have very strong emotional ties to the union. It would absolutely break my heart to see the Scottish element of the Union flag unpicked and separated from it when I’ve fought together with my English, Welsh and Northern Irish comrades.’

Ruth Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservatives, added: ‘In no area is the case for our United Kingdom better made than in defence. Why, on this small island, would we split up the defences that have kept us safe for centuries?’

‘We are stronger and safer together. These veterans know it and will be voting to keep Scotland secure as part of the United Kingdom on Thursday.’
