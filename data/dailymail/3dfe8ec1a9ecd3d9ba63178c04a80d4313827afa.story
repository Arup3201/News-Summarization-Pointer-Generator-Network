Lib Dem attempts to distance themselves from deep Tory cuts descended into farce today when two thirds of Nick Clegg's MPs stayed away from the Commons debate on their rival Yellow Budget.

In an unprecedented move, Lib Dem Treasury minister Danny Alexander used a statement from the government Despatch Box to spell out how he disagreed with Conservative plans for spending cuts.

But despite the extraordinary stunt - which signals the death of the coalition - being central to Lib Dem hopes of survival at the next election, only 17 MPs, including Mr Alexander, bothered to turned up.

Danny Alexander set out the alternative Lib Dem Budget, which includes:

Before Mr Alexander's statement even got underway, Commons Speaker John Bercow cast doubt on the exercise, insisting statements 'have to be ministerial, delivered not in a personal or party capacity but on behalf of the Government'.

The Lib Dem minister carried on regardless, with just a handful of backbenchers looking on.

On the government frontbench, only Deputy PM Nick Clegg, Lib Dem chief whip Don Foster, Business Secretary Vince Cable and deputy Commons leader Tom Brake had turned up.

After a slow start, a few more Lib Dems eventually filed in, taking the total to 17, less than a third of the 56 the party currently boasts. 

Asked why so few colleagues had found the time to support Mr Alexander, a party insider said organising Lib Dem MPs was like 'herding cats'. 

Mr Clegg himself got up and walked out while Mr Alexander was under attack from his Labour opponents. 

To much mockery from Labour, Mr Alexander ploughed on, claiming he was setting out Lib Dem plans for those 'left cold' by George Osborne's Budget.

Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Chris Leslie blasted: Don't you realise how two-faced you look? You [the Lib Dems] want to have your cake and eat it, to be in Government but not in Government.

'It's too late for this. The Liberal Democrats have backed the Tories all the way, working families have paid the price and now it is time for you to pay the ultimate price for your behaviour.' 

Despite confirming that the Budget was agreed by the Tories and the Lib Dems, Mr Alexander criticised the plans contained in it to cut government spending to 1964 levels - 'the era of Cathy Come Home'.

As he tried to set out his Lib Dem plan that 'borrows less than Labour' and 'cuts less than the Conservatives', he was met with a volley of heckling from Labour backbenchers.

Shouts of 'this is an abuse of office' and 'this is ridiculous' could be heard as Opposition MPs and others waved the coalition Budget document.

In a further sign of chaos, Labour frontbencher Andrew Gwynne reached across the table separating the despatch boxes with a copy of the red book and dropped it in front of Mr Alexander.

Just 17 Lib Dem MPs were in the Commons to hear Mr Alexander's statement, with 40 choosing to stay awa

Undeterred, Mr Alexander detailed the Lib Dems' 'better economic plan for Britain'. He said: 'Yesterday the Chancellor set out the final coalition Budget of this parliament.

'The policy measures contained in the Budget document were all agreed between us.

'I secured key Liberal Democrat commitments, including a significant increase in the income tax personal allowance, support for mental health, tax measures to support motorists, scotch whisky and the oil and gas sector because together they make our society fairer and our economy stronger.

'Yet I know that millions of people watching yesterday's exchanges between the Chancellor and the Opposition leader were left wondering 'Isn't there another way to do this?'.

'Because, of course, people want a stronger economy based on a credible plan. But people also want a fairer society based on modern public services.'

Mr Alexander was repeatedly heckled and mocked by Labour over his attempts to distance himself from the Tories who he has shared power with for five years

Mr Alexander said Tory spending plans would take government consumption back to the levels seen in 1964, adding: 'The era of Cathy Come Home is not my vision for the future of Britain'

Mr Alexander went on: 'So to all those people left cold by yesterday's exchanges, to all those asking themselves is there another way, today I say yes there is, there is a better way.

'Today I set out a better economic plan for Britain - a plan that is based on values of fairness as well as strength, a plan that delivers on our commitment to balance the books in a fair way.

'A plan that borrows less than Labour, cuts less than the Conservatives and enables our country to see light at the end of the tunnel, not a rollercoaster ride but a steady path back to prosperity.

'This sticks to the path that we have chosen in this Government, not lurching away from it by cutting too much or borrowing too much.

'The fiscal forecast published by the Chancellor yesterday would, according to the Office of Budget Responsibility, return government consumption, the effective spending power of the state, back to the level last seen in 1964.

'But the era of Cathy Come Home is not my vision for the future of Britain.'

Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Chris Leslie blasted: 'Don't you realise how two-faced you look?

Mr Bercow had said he would be put in a difficult position if Mr Alexander used 'the privilege accorded to ministers for purely party purposes' but he took a back seat for much of the speech.

Before the statement, Mr Bercow said: 'The content of ministerial statements is by a longstanding practice not a matter for the chair, nor is my permission required for such a statement to be made.

'But these statements have to be ministerial, delivered not in a personal or a party capacity but on behalf of the Government.

'While some latitude is, of course, permitted, there does come a point at which using the privilege accorded to ministers for purely party purposes would be unfair to the House and put the chair in a very difficult position. I know that Mr Alexander will bear that in mind.'
