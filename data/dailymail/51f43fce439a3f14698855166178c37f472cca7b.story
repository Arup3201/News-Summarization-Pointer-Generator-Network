Germans are in fear of a return to the urban terror days of the Red Army Faction after leftists tried to blow up a railway station and derail high-speed express trains.

Explosives experts yesterday removed seven petrol bombs equipped with time detonators found by a railway worker in a tunnel leading into Berlin's central station.

A left-wing group calling itself Hekla claimed responsibility for the firebombs in an online statement.

Terror: The entrance of the Hauptbahnhof, Berlin's main train station. Bottles with flammable liquids were found in a tunnel leading to the station

The group condemned the German army's mission in Afghanistan and demanded the release of imprisoned US soldier Bradley Manning, who is accused of having leaked information to WikiLeaks.

The discovery followed an arson attack
on signalling equipment along a line heading towards Hamburg which 
caused severe delays to the mainline service between the two cities.

The attacks have German politicians and police warning of a resurgence of the kind of left-wing terrorist that plagued West Germany 40 years ago.

Already this year 600 expensive cars have been torched in the city by anarchists.

Now
the foiled bomb attacks indicate a ratcheting up of the campaign that, 
say police, will result in deaths unless they can be contained.

'We are experience a Renaissance of the Red Army Faction. The leftist terror is on the rise,' said Rainer Wendt, the chief of the German Police Union.

The Red Army Faction (RAF) - which grew out of the Baader-Meinhof terrorist clique - shot, bombed, kidnapped and terrorised West Germany in the Seventies.

The group targeted numerous establishment figures in their bid to overthrow the state.

While the old structures of the RAF have long atrophied, Wendt warned: 'The new terrorist groups are decentralised, loosely affiliated with many individual small groups.'

This makes it harder to catch them when individuals know nothing of activists outside their own small cells, he added.

Fears: A cameraman films the tracks where the incendiary devices were found. The discovery has raised fears of a resurgence of left wing terror groups

The Red Army Faction (in German: Rote Armee Fraktion) was one of Germany's most violent and prolific left-wing terror groups.

Describing itself as a communist and anti-imperialist 'urban guerilla' outfit, the group engaged in armed resistance against what they deemed to be the fascist West German state.

With roots in the student protest movement of the Sixties, the RAF was formed in 1970 by Andreas Baader, Gudrun Ensslin, Horst Mahler, and Ulrike Meinhof.

Though it always called itself the RAF, the group was popularly known as the Baader-Meinhof Gang, after the two most prominent of its founding members.

Between 1970 and 1988 the RAF was involved in various terrorist operations across West Germany. They fought what they called an 'anti-imperialist struggle' with bank robberies to raise money, kidnappings, and bomb attacks against U.S. military facilities, German police stations, and buildings belonging to newspaper organisations.

It was held responsible for 34 deaths and many more injuries in its 30 years of activity, but nevertheless enjoyed a measure of public support that violent leftists in the U.S., like the Weathermen, were never able to drum up.

On 20 April 1998, an eight-page typewritten letter in German was faxed to the Reuters news agency, signed 'RAF' with the group's machine-gun red star logo, declaring that the group had dissolved.

Fuelled by a hatred of banks, recruiting young people with no hope of a job, these new radicals are now under the observation of intelligence services in Germany as fears grow of escalating violence.

This year numerous police vehicles have been torched in Berlin and the neighbouring state of Brandenburg.

Günter Krings, a domestic security expert with the government, believes it is 'premature' to talk of a return to the carnage of the RAF. But he admitted: 'We have to take these attacks very, very seriously. We cannot dismiss them as merely attacks against objects.

'Attacks against things can suddenly change into attacks on human beings. The fire on the railway line obviously endangered peoples' lives.'

Uwe Schünemann, the interior minister for the state of Lower Saxony, said; 'The leftists are putting out propaganda on the internet detailing where the weak spots are in police body armour in order to wound officers. They are targeting police vehicles to set ablaze.

'They even have tips on how to attack police officers. We are in the preliminary stages of a new wave of leftist terror.

'I see parallels between the situation today and the start of the RAF. With them it started with fires and then later, people were being murdered. Therefore I say: resist the beginning.'

The Office for the Protection of the Constitution also warned in a report in July of the rise of leftist violence stating: 'The attacks by left-wing extremists exhibit a significantly increased aggressiveness and willingness to take risks.'
