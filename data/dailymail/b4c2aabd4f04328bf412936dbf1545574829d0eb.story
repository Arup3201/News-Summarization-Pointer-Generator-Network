But the star hit back at his critics on Twitter, defending the prize and saying the girl who won the dog 'loved it'.

The
controversial giveaway happened on last Saturday night’s episode of 
Lemonaid when he invited three kids onto the show, offering them the 
chance to win a puppy.

After
a challenge in which the youngsters’ parents had to fish bones out of 
an inflatable pool dressed as dogs, helped by Peter Andre, the winner 
was a 10 year-old girl called Kasey.

She was presented with the Pug by the Aussie pop singer, deciding to call it Keith.

Response: The comedian took to Twitter to defend the show's pug giveaway

Response: A spokesperson for the programme¿s makers Talkback said: 'An independent, qualified vet visited each home in advance of the show to conduct a thorough check before'

The
breed, which are popular toy dogs among celebrities, are also well 
known for contracting health problems such as breathing difficulty, 
overheating and obesity.

Soon after 
the show Francis, 38, began receiving a torrent of Tweets from animal 
lovers criticising his decision to award the dog as a game show prize.

One
viewer called Charlotte91xx tweeted: 'Disgusted at @LeighFrancis show 
giving away a puppy how they did last night. Fine line between funny and
stupid #wontbewatchingagain'

Another,
called @SixtiesDancer followed that, saying: 'Please tell me you didn’t
give a dog away as a prize. If you did you’ve gone way down In my 
estimation.'

Francis then replied personally, defending the decision, he said: 'We did and that little girl loved it!'

Again the concerned viewer responded saying: 'But for how long. I think ur a talented man but uv made a big mistake giving pets as prizes. You’ve opened a can of worms.'

In a flippant response, Francis hit back saying: 'Good, I love worms.'

As more criticism flowed in, the comedian soon changed tact, insisting that the families of the child contestants had been interviewed to make sure they were suitable to own a dog.

Francis said: 'The breeders interviewed the parents and they seemed responsible nice people who actually really wanted a dog. That’s why. Nothing to do with me. I’m just the host. Although you have no knowledge of the logistics of what actually happened.'

Eventually fed up with the onlsaught, Frances gave up defending the show and even hinted that he would quit the site altogether tweeting: 'They (viewers) always giving me a hard time.

'Twitter is turning into a horrible waste of time. Good bye twitter people x'

A spokesperson for the programme’s makers Talkback said: 'An independent, qualified vet visited each home in advance of the show to conduct a thorough check before the rehoming process, to ensure that each family understood the commitment and responsibility involved.'
