A juror in the George Zimmerman trial claims the case ruined her life and says she's had death threats made against her children, lost friends, her job and will soon lose her home as a result of it. The juror, a 36-year-old mother of eight who only identified herself as Maddy during an interview on Inside Edition Thursday, was the only juror who showed her face when she appeared on Good Morning America in July.Since then, Maddy says, she's lost her job as an aide at a nursing home and she and her husband have had to sell most of their possessions.

Ruined: The juror known only as Maddy says her life has been ruined as a result of being part of the jury that found George Zimmerman not guilty

Maddy, who is of Puerto Rican descent, was the only minority juror on the all-female panel that found George Zimmerman not guilty.

On the July episode of Good Morning America, she told host Robin Roberts that she believed Zimmerman was guilty of murdering teenager Trayvon Martin.

'My first vote was secondary murder,' she said.

'I was the juror who was going to give them the hung jury. Oh, I was. I fought to the end.'

She said that she and the rest of the jury were unable to prove Zimmerman intentionally killed Martin, and that under law they had to acquit.

'George Zimmerman got away with murder. But you can't get away from God,' she said.

Now, Maddy says that going public as a juror on the divisive case has resulted in ruin.

'My whole life has fallen apart,' she told Inside Edition's Les Trent.

She and her husband have slowly sold off their possessions, including their bedroom suite and the family's dining room table.

They now sit on the floor of the kitchen to eat their meals.'As we sold one thing, we paid one bill, another bill came,' she said.

The Florida mom, who was a full-time nurse's aide, says she kept calling for weeks but wasn't given any work.

Her friends began to shun her and strangers even threatened her children.

'On Facebook, someone wrote I'm gonna the feel same pain as Travon Martin's mom. Which means I'm gonna lose my son. All this blame was put on me. No one is looking at George Zimmerman. He's the one who killed the child,' she said.

When asked whether she regrets serving as juror B-29 in the George Zimmerman trial, Maddy's response was unequivocal.

'Yes, I do.'
