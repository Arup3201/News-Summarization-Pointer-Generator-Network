A co-founder of the popular frozen yogurt chain Pinkberry has been ordered to stand trial on charges he beat a homeless man with a tire iron in California.

A judge on Thursday denied a motion to dismiss the assault with a deadly weapon case against Young Lee.

Lee is free on bail and is no longer is affiliated with Pinkberry.

Legal problems: Pinkberry co-founder Young Lee, pictured with his attorney Philip Kent Cohen at a court hearing in Los Angeles last month, had illegal guns in his home, police claim. He is accused of beating up a homeless man with a tyre iron

Forty-two-year-old Donald Bolding testified this week that he was begging from drivers on a freeway off-ramp last year in Hollywood when his shirt rode up and revealed a sexually explicit tattoo.

He says a man he identified as Lee got out of a car, demanded he apologize to his wife, then attacked him. Bolding was struck twice in the head and suffered a broken arm before witnesses stopped the attack.

Lee's attorney claims his client was threatened by the man and thought he had a weapon.

But
 police believe it was the Korean-born entrepreneur who first approached
 him after seeing what he deemed a disrespectful tattoo.

They
 believe that Lee drove over to the man, rolled down his window and 
started arguing with him, before getting out to confront him.

Officials
 say Lee demanded that the man kneel on the ground and apologise and 
even though he consented, he still attacked him with the tyre iron.

Craze: Lee co-founded Pinkberry with partner Shelly Hwang. They opened their first shop in Hollywood in 2005, immediately gaining a celebrity following

The homeless man was beaten so brutally he had to be hospitalised.

Former kickboxer Lee paints a very different picture, however.

His
 attorney Philip Kent Cohen last month told the Los Angeles Times: 
'The transient made explicit threats as if he had a weapon, which he may
 have had.

'As the evidence comes out, the reality will be much different than has been presented.

'All of the people in the car felt at risk and felt threatened.'

Lee
 - who co-founded the healthy, low-calorie dessert chain - was arrested 
after a witness called police and gave the license plate number of the 
Range Rover involved, which was rented in Lee's name.

Hugely successful: The Korean-born entrepreneur already has a conviction for possession of a firearm

Investigators later recovered the tyre iron through the rental car agency.

Witnesses picked Lee from police photos and authorities obtained the warrant while the 47-year-old was traveling overseas.

According
 to police, a federal database alerted Los Angeles detectives that Lee 
was aboard an inbound flight from Korea to Los Angeles Airport in January, when he was arrested.

Lee has also been accused of owning illegal guns, according to police.

Police searched Lee's Los Angeles home and fleet of luxury cars after his arrest in January this year and found two handguns, a Colt .45 and a Para Ordnance Brand .45.

It is unclear whether the firearms were found in Lee's house or high-end vehicles including a 2009 Rolls-Royce Phantom, 2007 Ferrari 599 GTB and a 2010 Mercedes G Wagon.

Accused: Young Lee, one of the founders of the Pinkberry yogurt chain appears during his arraignment in the Los Angeles Criminal Courts Building in Los Angeles, Monday, Jan. 30, 2012

A police search warrant affidavit obtained by TMZ.com states that, due to a 2001 conviction for drugs possession, Lee is not allowed to 'own, buy, receive, possess, or have custody or control of any firearms'.

He also has a conviction for possession of a firearm and could now face this same charge again.

Lee, a kick-boxer-turned-architect-turned-entrepreneur, co-founded Pinkberry with partner Shelly Hwang, CBS Los Angeles reports.

They opened their first location in West Hollywood in 2005, gaining a celebrity following and sparking a frozen yoghurt craze.
