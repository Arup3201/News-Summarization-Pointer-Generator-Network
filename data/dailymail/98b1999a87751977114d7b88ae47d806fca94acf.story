King Edward VIII sparked a constitutional crisis when he proposed to American socialite Wallis Simpson just a few months after he was handed the monarchy in 1936. 

The Prime Minster and many others opposed the union because Wallis had already been divorced once and was in the process of divorcing her second husband, so the King chose to abdicate instead of giving up his lover. 

But while he would have been dismayed at having to give up the throne, a racy nightdress that was worn by Wallis while the couple were in exile and is now up for auction shows she knew how to console him.

King Edward VIII abdicated in 1936 so he could marry divorcee Wallis. The couple were shunned in the UK, so spent next few years in France, where this sheer nightie was made by a French couture house. The pink silk chiffon night dress with black Chantilly lace is now up for auction.

Wallis wore the pink silk chiffon nightie, lined with black Chantilly lace,  while the couple were in exile in France after Edward gave up the monarchy in 1936.

It is so sheer there was nowhere to put a label, but experts say the delicate item is definitely French couture and even still has a faint whiff of her perfume on it.

London-based auctioneer Kerry Taylor said the garment would make a great Christmas present for anyone wanting to impress the woman in their life.

Wallis Simpson captured the heart of the Prince of Wales after they met in 1931. 

King Edward VIII sparked a constitutional crisis when he proposed to American socialite Wallis Simpson just a few months after he was handed the monarchy in 1936. Wallis  captured the heart of the Prince of Wales after they first met in 1931, but she was still married to her second husband at the time 

After giving up the throne and marrying in 1937, the couple were shunned by polite society in the UK and forced to move to France.

The couple lived in a grand home in Paris and the property and its contents was bought by former Harrods owner Mohamed Al-Fayed in the 1980s.

Among the items was the nightdress that was bought by the current owner at a previous charity auction.

To the outside world Wallis seemed incredibly elegant, but it was quite a hard elegance. She used to say, 'I'm not beautiful but I dress to make sure everyone looks at me and my husband and feel proud.'

The anonymous owner is now selling it through Kerry Taylor Auctions in London with an estimate of £600.

Miss Taylor said: 'Things like this are very rare and this is a very personal item.

'This is almost certainly French couture but it is unlabelled. 

'It's incredibly beautiful, transparent, super feminine, bias cut and very slinky.

'Wallis Simpson had the very best bed linen and lingerie. Everything was the best of its kind, the best money could buy.

Wallis and Edward stayed together until his death in 1972. When Wallis passed away in 1986, she was buried alongside him in the royal burial ground of Windsor Castle

She continued: 'She didn't have a lot to fill her time so shopping was a major occupation for her.

'To the outside world she seemed incredibly elegant, but it was quite a hard elegance. This nightdress shows the more vulnerable, softer, seductive side of Wallis Simpson.

'She used to say "I'm not beautiful but I dress to make sure everyone looks at me and my husband and feel proud".

'This could appeal to somebody who is interested in the Windsor story. 

'But it's also the most beautiful couture nightdress with a wonderful history and it could make a great Christmas present for the seductress in someone's life.'

The auction takes place on December 9. 

Wallis Simpson was already making waves in high society in the early 1930s, but even she could hardly have imagined at the turn of the decade that she would soon be responsible for one of the biggest constitutional crises ever in the Britain. 

When Wallis first met Prince Edward in January 1931, she was still happily married to her second husband Ernest. 

But the royal quickly became infatuated and three years later they had fallen in love and started a full-blown affair. 

At first, the relationship raised few concerns as Edward was notorious for his affairs with society ladies. 

But when Edward's father George V died in January 1936 and he chose to watch the proclamation of his accession in the company of Simpson, it became clear that  the relationship had become serious.

Edward made several attempts throughout 1936 to make Wallis his wife and keep the throne, but they were rejected by the British, Australian and South African Prime Ministers. 

They refused on two main points, firstly, because the political establishment considered a twice-divorced woman an unsuitable consort, and secondly, because Edward was now head of the Church of England, which at the time, did not allow marriages between divorcees. 

While the British media held off from printing about the affair, many foreign news outlets had been covering the romance in detail since the beginning of the year. 

By early December, the true nature of Simpson's relationship with the King had become public knowledge and she fled the country to escape from the public attention. 

Despite attempts by Simpson to get him to reconsider, on December 13, 1936, Edward abdicated and was succeeded by his brother, George VI.

The couple eventually married, a month after Wallis' second divorce was granted, on the June 3, 1937 in the south of France.

Edward was made Duke of Windsor by his brother and was entitled to the style 'His Royal Highness', but his wife was refused the honour and was styled instead as 'Her Grace.'

The couple stayed together until Edward's death in 1972. 

When Wallis passed away in 1986, she was buried alongside Edward in the royal burial ground of Windsor Castle.
