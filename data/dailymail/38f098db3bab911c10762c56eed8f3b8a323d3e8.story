Hundreds of pro-democracy campaigners defied a government deadline and remained camped out on the streets of Hong Kong today, but allowed city workers to return to offices they had been blocking.  

Protesters largely cleared an area outside the city's government headquarters where they had gathered for more than a week, but have vowed to keep pressure on officials until they prove they are sincere in responding to their demands.

But as tensions appeared to subside, police today reported finding two bags containing a total of 20 long knives left on a footbridge near an occupation site in Admiralty, where pro-democracy protesters have been camping out.

Ten 17-inch knives were found concealed in a backpack on a footbridge about 6.30am.  Hours earlier, 10 knives were also found at the site. No arrests have been made.  

Some barricades blocking the government building's entrance were removed after officials told protesters they would do whatever was necessary to ensure 3,000 civil servants would have full access to their offices today.  

About 25 protesters, mostly students, refused to budge from the site, and some plan to stay there for as long as they can. They have vowed to refuse to engage with the government if force is used to move them.

Lester Shum, one of the protesting group's leaders said: 'If the government uses force to clear away protesters, there will be no room for dialogue.'

Around 200 protesters also remained in the Mong Kok area today where some scuffles broke out over the weekend. 

Protesters had feared police may clear the streets by force, but it seemed officials were happy to settle for a partial victory in clearing some areas. 

Police spokesman Steve Hui said: 'To restore order, we are determined, and we are confident we have the capability to take any necessary action.

He added: 'There should not be any unreasonable, unnecessary obstruction by any members of the public.' 

Parts of a main thoroughfare through the heart of the business district remain closed, but schools today reopened. 

Student demonstrators say they have taken early steps to begin talks with the government on their demands for wider political reforms, but actual negotiations have not started.

Tens of thousands of people, many of them students, have poured into the streets as part of the protests that began on September 28 to peacefully protest China's restrictions on the first direct election for Hong Kong's leader, promised by Beijing for 2017. The protests are the strongest challenge to authorities in Beijing since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.

China has promised that Hong Kong can have universal suffrage by 2017, but it says a committee of mostly pro-Beijing figures must screen candidates for the top job. 

The protesters are also demanding the resignation of Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, the city's current leader, but he has refused to step down. Protests continue outside his offices. 

Some activists disagree with the partial withdrawal at government headquarters, and an alliance of students say they will keep up their protests until talks are scheduled

Protesters littered the streets outside the office of Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, the city's current leader, who they have called on to step down

Some activists disagree with the partial withdrawal at government headquarters, and an alliance of students say they will keep up their protests until details of the talks are worked out.

Alex Chow, a student leader, said he was not worried about the crowd dwindling.

He said: 'Because people need rest, but they will come out again. It doesn't mean the movement is diminishing. Many people still support it.'

But Louis Chan, who still plans to stay at the government headquarters for 'as long as he can', is not sure achieving universal suffrage - the students' original goal - is now likely.

He said: 'I think it was possible, but now I don't think so because they (the Hong Kong government) don't give any response and China is also very much against this.'

Police said they had arrested 30 people since the start of the protests. Protesters, meanwhile, complained the police were failing to protect them from attacks by mobs intent on driving them away. 

Meanwhile, former Hong Kong chief secretary Anson Chan Fang On-sang has slammed the British government’s 'profoundly disappointing responses' to the protests.

Writing in the Guardian newspaper, Ms Chan, now head of the pro-democracy think tank Hong Kong 2020, states that the UK has 'a moral and legal responsibility to Hong Kong'.

She said: 'It did after all sign a treaty, back in 1984, that guaranteed Hong Kong’s core values and way of life, including freedom of speech and assembly, until 2047.'

Ms Chan goes on to comment Britain’s reluctance to risk a stand-off with Beijing: 'Their first instinct is to keep their heads low; they just want things to carry on as before, would like the protests to disappear, and maintain good relations with China.'
