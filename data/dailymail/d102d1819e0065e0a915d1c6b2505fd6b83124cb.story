Allison Williams is putting her wedding plans on hold amid her father Brian's scandal.

On Wednesday, the 26-year-old eldest child of the NBC Nightly News anchor spoke at a Q&A session to discuss her career with late night host Seth Meyers, when she answered questions regarding her upcoming nuptials and how her family was doing following the recent scandal.

'Current events started happening so that derailed [wedding plans] a little bit,' revealed the Girls actress.

It was also revealed that the 55-year-old embattled evening news managing editor resigned from the Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation board of directors on Thursday.

Family first: Allison Williams, who is engaged to Ricky Van Veen, revealed that her wedding plans are put on hold amid her father Brian's scandal when she spoke at a Q&A event  in New York City on Wednesday

Allison became engaged a year ago this month to Ricky Van Veen, the co-founder of hit website CollegeHumor.

'It's been a very full year. You sort of think, "What could possibly come along that would make me not think about this?" And then I get Peter Pan and I think, "Okay, I will think only about Neverland and then we'll go back to planning our wedding,"' she shared.

'Then current events started happening, so that derailed it a little bit, but it has been this really beautiful through line in our lives. It's just something we haven't focused on, but, spoiler alert, we are excited!'

'The best newsman and best father I know': Allison shared this touching photo on her Instagram account on December 2

The actress daughter of 12-time Emmy winning journalist Brian Williams has spoken out to defend her father for the first time since he was suspended for six months for making false claims about his time in Iraq in 2003.

She described her father was 'an honest man, a truthful man,' at the NYC event.

'This has been a really hard time,' she said. 'One thing this experience has not done is shake my trust and belief in him as a man. 

'He's a really good man, an honest man, a truthful man — he has so much integrity and so much respect for journalism. And yes he's a really good dad. I know you can trust him because, as any good daughter does, I've tested him on that.'

Allison spoke while 'looking down at the stage' and 'with a subdued tone,' a witness told the New York Post.

Passionate: The Peter Pan Live! star told host Seth Meyers that she is proud of her father and that is he is a man of the utmost integrity

At the end of last year she starred in the critically-panned Peter Pan Live, which was aired on the same channel that suspended her father earlier this month.

Allison said her entire family were rallying round her beleaguered father.

'My mom has been so strong and my brother has been amazing. My dad has always been there for us a 100 percent of the time… so to be here for him is the least we can do,' she said.

Referencing her father's time in Iraq in 2003, she recalled how he had promised to be back in time to take her to a 9th grade father-daughter dance.

'As the day was coming, it didn't seem like he was going to make it as he had promised… I was so upset and I got a surprise call from my dad from Iraq, and he was asking if I had a date to the dance. So that's the kind of man he is.

'I can't wait until he's back on TV and I know many of you guys feel that way. Thank you for all your support.' she said to applause from the audience. 

While his daughter is looking forward to her dream wedding, Brian is still paying the consequences from the military scandal.

The Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation announced on Thursday that the NBC correspondent stepped down from the group's board of directors after serving as a member for over eight years.

The non-profit organization is dedicated to promote military valor and heroism, consisting exclusively of the living Medal of Honor recipients. 

Allison starred in the critically-panned Peter Pan Live which was aired in December on the same channel that suspended her father earlier this month, while on Wednesday she brought some color to a Michael Kors fashion show during New York Fashion Week

Allison has made a name for herself playing Marnie in the HBO series Girls, but a three-hour live production of Peter Pan which aired in December proved a ratings flop for NBC.

The musical production only attracted an audience of 9.1 million viewers - less than half of what The Sound Of Music production the previous year had achieved. 

Earlier on Wednesday, Allison had brought some color to a Michael Kors fashion show during New York Fashion Week.

The star wore a royal blue two-piece ensemble featuring giant yellow blooms, including a sleeveless crop top that showed off her taut midriff, and a heavy full skirt.

Allison coordinated the look with royal blue pointed-toe pumps and wore her dark hair partially swept back.

Her father's departure from the Nightly News has resulted in the show losing 700,000 viewers.

Ratings for the network's Nightly News broadcast dipped by double-digits last Wednesday during its first broadcast that had suspended anchor Brian Williams' name stripped from the title.

Nielsen's 'fast affiliate numbers' revealed that the nightly telecast's 9.8m viewers from Monday night had slipped to 8.6m by Thursday in what turned out to be its lowest numbers of the week.

Williams received a six-month unpaid suspension this week after it was revealed the anchor falsely claimed he was inside a helicopter that came under fire during a mission in Iraq. 

Weekend anchor Lester Holt has temporarily taken his place since February 10.
