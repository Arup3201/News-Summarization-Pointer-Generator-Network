Tony Blair has told political allies that he believes the Conservatives will win the next election because Ed Miliband has failed to connect with voters, it was reported last night.

The former prime minister has apparently said that the Labour leader ‘cannot beat’ David Cameron in 2015.

Mr Blair is reported to believe the Conservatives will remain in power next year because Labour has not persuaded Britain it is ready to govern.

But last night Mr Blair’s office said the story was ‘absurd’ – and that he believes Labour can win.

Mr Blair’s reported verdict on Mr Miliband follows criticism of the Labour leader’s performance from some senior figures in his party.

The Daily Telegraph said Mr Blair’s apparent prediction was made in a private conversation with long-standing political allies earlier this month.

One person who was present told the newspaper: ‘The Conservatives will be the next government because Labour has failed to make a good case for itself. That is what Tony thinks. He does not think that Miliband can beat Cameron.’

Recent polls have shown Labour’s lead over the Tories narrow to just one percentage point, on average.

Some of Mr Blair’s allies fear Mr Miliband is not doing enough to appeal to the centre-ground voters who gave the party three general election victories between 1997 and 2005.

Lord Prescott, Mr Blair’s former deputy, has said that Mr Miliband is pursuing a ‘core vote strategy’ of appealing only to traditional Labour supporters and disaffected Liberal Democrats. Other Labour figures are concerned that Mr Miliband has failed to develop a clear strategy for responding to Ukip and its voters’ concerns over immigration and Europe.

Last month former Labour home secretary Alan Johnson suggested Mr Miliband should have joined the Army so he seemed less of a ‘geek’.

Mr Johnson was defending Mr Miliband after a poll suggested the public did not see him as a strong leader.

And earlier this month former Labour MP Andrew MacKinlay said Mr Miliband must resign if Labour is to win the election.

Mr Miliband has himself confessed to problems with presentation – including in a speech when he admitted he looked less like a prime minister than David Cameron.

Last night Mr Blair’s office said: ‘We will not be commenting on unattributed statements except to say that this is not his view. He wants and hopes to see a Labour victory and believes Labour can indeed win under Ed’s leadership.’

A tweet was sent from Mr Blair’s official account @tonyblairoffice saying: ‘TB says: The Telegraph story does not represent my view. Ed Miliband and the Labour Party can and will win the next election.’

A Labour Party source said Mr Miliband would continue with his current strategy.

‘This election will be won by the party which can get the country working again,’ the source said.

‘Labour is the only party which can do this with a plan to save the NHS, change the economy, freeze energy prices and reform the banks.’
