Lucia Ruiz, a 6th grader from Deerfield, Illinois, was traveling with her Aunt and Uncle in Spain last month when tragedy struck as the high speed train she was in derailed, killing 79 near Santiago de Compostela.

Lucia was sitting in one of the rear carriages of the train, hit hardest with the highest number of casualties and was tossed around like a rag doll fracturing her legs, hip, pelvis, tail bone, her skull and suffered internal bleeding.

Spending almost a week in the ICU in Spain, Lucia and her family are struggling to deal with the crisis brought on by her medical bills as they battle to get her the care she needs to return home.

'She was basically thrown … they were kind of bounced around within the wagon and then they were thrown out of the wagon somehow,' said Ismael Ruiz, the girl’s father to CBS Chicago.

Almost 80 people died and near 200 injured when the commuter train sped through a curve and derailed, sending train carriages flying off the tracks into flaming piles of rubble.

Lucia, 11, is now recovering in hospital just two miles from the crash scene and she has already had one bout of surgery to save her left leg and another on her knee.

She survived the horrific crash but it is not known when she may be able to return home due to the severity of her injuries.

'She was the worst by far and she was very lucky as well because she was one of the first persons that was rescued from the train,' said Ismael Ruiz.

Her mother Paloma is confident her little girl will recover, but her father told CBS Chicago that his daughter is worried for the future.

'She is starting to wonder about what are the implications, school, sports, friends,' said Ismael Ruiz.

The family has set up a website to help with her medical bills and their neighbors back in Deerfield are also remembering them in their prayers.

Moment of impact: The train hurtled off the tracks and smashed into a wall, leaving at least 79 people dead and up to 141 were injured

In order to help with her long term care and enormous medical bills, friends and family have set up a GiveForward fundraiser - which has raised over $10,000.

Dramatic video footage from a security camera shows the train careering into a concrete wall as it came off the rails on the bend, before flipping onto its side and hurtling down the railway line with its terrified passengers on board.

One of the drivers was trapped in his cabin and told the railway station by radio that the train entered the bend at 190 kilometers per hour (120 mph), reported newspaper El Pais.

The speed limit on that section of track is 80km/h (50mph).

To help Lucia return home please donate to her GiveForward fund.
