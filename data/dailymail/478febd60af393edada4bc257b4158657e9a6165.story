A binman has discovered a dead baby's body in a London park popular with dog walkers and joggers.

The child was found in the rubbish on Tooting Bec Common in the south of the city, and police have cordoned off the area where it was found.

Sources say the baby may have been stillborn and was found in an area often referred to as 'Nappy Valley' because of the number of young families there.

Operation: Police are going through rubbish after a baby's body parts were discovered by a binman today

A worker for Fountains, the private contractor which collects the park's rubbish, said: 'The baby's body was found by a Fountain binman this morning.'

Forensic officers wearing blue suits are combing the area, and going through other bins and rubbish bags.

A large number of police were concentrating their search on a work depot in the park which is used as a store for refuse and park vehicles.

Vehicles were pulled up outside the depot today while forensic officers searched through rubbish bags on their three flat bed loaders.

Bins around the leafy park had also been sealed off as police rifled through rubbish bags looking for clues.

Search: Parts of Tooting Bec Common have been cordoned off so forensics officers comb the area

Claims: It is understood that the body was found by a Fountains worker, the company that collects rubbish so police like this officer are looking at their depot

Police sniffer dogs were also deployed around the perimeter of the depot, which is surrounded by hedges.

A police spokesman said: 'We were called at about 8am to reports of body parts, believed to be of an infant child, found at a location in Dr Johnson Avenue.

'Officers from Wandsworth borough are on the scene and inquiries are continuing at this early stage.'

Dog walkers have expressed horror at the gruesome discovery.

Shock: Police were called to the common this morning and local residents have expressed their dismay at what has happened

A 48 year-old woman who was walking her dog on the common said: 'It is really terrible. I am just incredibly shocked that such a horrific thing could have happened here.

'I walk my dog here everyday and nothing like this has ever happened before.

'It is just so shocking. This is such a family oriented area. That poor child, it is too awful to think what happened to it.'
