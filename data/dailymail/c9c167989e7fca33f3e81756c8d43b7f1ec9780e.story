Kenny McDowall would welcome Ally McCoist back into the Rangers dug-out were he to make a surprise return from gardening leave.

The question of who leads the squad for the remainder of a flagging promotion campaign is high on the agenda for Dave King and the new Ibrox directors.

McDowall became caretaker manager when McCoist left under the previous regime before Christmas, but began working his own notice period in January.

Interim chairman Paul Murray has stated that new board — which has already been approached by number of managerial candidates as they weigh up a longer-term appointment — will have to speak to both men to ‘ask what they want to do’ given that they remain employees.

A financial agreement over McCoist’s remaining contract may well be the more likely outcome, but McDowall would be happy to see his old colleague back for the Championship run-in were that to transpire.

‘I was working with Ally, so obviously that would appeal to me,’ said McDowall. ‘But it’s a difficult one to answer because the board will obviously have their own ideas.’

McDowall said it wasn't for him to decide but that he would welcome Walter Smith back to the club too

Another former Ibrox boss, Walter Smith, refused at the weekend to completely rule out what would be a third stint in charge, but stressed that he wasn’t looking for it ‘in any way, shape or form.’

McDowall was first-team coach during Smith’s hugely successful second spell and admitted his presence would provide a guaranteed boost.

‘It’s not for me to decide,’ said McDowall, who is keen for coach Ian Durrant to return to first-team duties after being demoted by the old board. ‘It’s for Walter to discuss with the board, if that’s the case.

‘But Walter Smith going anywhere would absolutely give the place a lift. He is a great man and has done so much in the game. Why would you not, at the end of the day? But, as I say, it’s not my call.

McCoist left the Ibrox club before Christmas on gardening leave and McCall later did the same

‘We had a very successful time when he was here but times are different. It’s been a tough, tough time we’ve had since he left.

‘Ally did a fantastic job without getting a whole lot of credit. But that will come eventually.’

The new directors are likely to speak with McDowall about his own future once tonight’s game against Queen of the South is out of the way.

They met yesterday with former Fulham boss Felix Magath, who is a Rangers shareholder and has ideas on how the footballing department could move forward. But he is not thought to be an immediate candidate to replace McDowall.

‘Every day, there is someone else being quoted — Walter, Felix Magath, Billy Davies, Stuart McCall, Terry Butcher,’ said McDowall.

‘All of those guys are out there and it’s the board’s right to talk to whoever they want. It doesn’t really affect me, because talk about replacing me has been there since I took the job as caretaker manager.

‘I’m here and ready to meet the new board whenever they want to meet me. I’m working my notice. If they want to keep me, they can keep me. If they want me to go then I’ll go.

‘There is nothing tricky about it. I’m here and I’m doing my best to try and get the team through a difficult period.’
