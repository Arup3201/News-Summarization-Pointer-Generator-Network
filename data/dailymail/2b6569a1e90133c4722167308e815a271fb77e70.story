A charity watchdog is examining possible extremist links at the Cardiff mosque where three British jihadis once worshipped, it has been revealed.

The Charity Commission launched the probe into the Al Manar centre in the Welsh capital amid 'concerns' that have been raised over the mosque.

The body says it is 'engaged' with the Al Manar Centre Trust on the 'regulatory issues in question' - but it declined to expand on what exactly it was looking into.

Earlier this summer two school friends, Nasser Muthana and Reyaad Khan, both of whom are 20 and attended the mosque, appeared in a chilling ISIS recruitment video.

Muthana's brother Aseel, 17, is also reported to be in Syria. The news sparked questions over what prompted the trio to join Isis.

Formerly a prospective medical student, Nasser Muthana was joined in Syria by his younger brother Aseel, 17, who has since spoken of his willingness to die fighting for ISIS.

The Muthana brothers grew up in Cardiff after their father moved there from Yemen as a teenager.

In June, their father Ahmed Muthana, 57, said if his sons ever return to the UK, he would like to see them jailed. 

Their friend Reyaad Khan, 20, also from Cardiff, said has said he had 'fireworks' for the U.S. if they returned to fight in Iraq. 

A Charity Commission spokesman told MailOnline: 'We’re aware of concerns raised about the Al Manar Centre Trust in the media.

'We have engaged with the charity on the regulatory issues in question. As this is an ongoing case, we cannot comment further at this time. Please note we are not formally investigating the charity.' 

Earlier this month it was reported that Prime Minister David Cameron said he would look into how the young men were able to obtain passports and travel to Syria to fight for Islamic state.

They are among as many as 600 Britons believed to have joined forces fighting President Bashar Assad in the last three years.

MailOnline has made attempts to contact the Al Manar Centre Trust today.  

A statement posted on the centre's website earlier this summer insisted it rejected extremism and condemned 'those who have recruited these young and impressionable individuals with false promises and a twisted version of Islam.'

The statement said: 'It is worth mentioning that ACT's stance is well known; that we are opposed to going to Syria or any other country, to participate in an armed struggle and have always made this clear.

'We would like to emphasise that the vast majority of the local Muslim community, are law abiding British citizens.'

In July, the centre told the Guardian that it denied having anything to do with the radicalisation of the three young men - and that they could have been inspired by images in the media.

The centre also denied visiting preachers may have encouraged the men to head to Syria.

A statement added that it had been liaising with South Wales police and the Muthana brothers' father.
