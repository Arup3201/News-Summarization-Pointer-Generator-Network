A Christmas party of epic proportions at the Honduran Embassy to Colombia involving prostitutes, booze, an orgy, looting - and worse - has  forced the resignation of the Central American nation's ambassador.

Details of the apparently legendary holiday soiree that left the Honduran mission in the capitol city of Bogota a paper-strewn shambles are still trickling into Honduran media reports. But what a spree the party apparently was.

All-night affair: The already-infamous affair reportedly got underway around 11pm and didn't conclude until 5am the next day

The Honduran newspaper El Heraldo reports that 'several' prostitutes were involved in what evidence suggests was a booze-fueled orgy at the embassy

Fired: Carlos Rodriguez Andino, the Honduran ambassador to Columbia, resigned Saturday following a riotous soiree at the embassy in Bogota

Early accounts reveal when mission employees arrived at the embassy Dec. 21, or the next day, they discovered - to their chagrin - Ambassador Carlos Rodriguez Andino's close friend and bodyguard - Jorge Mendoza - dozing without dignity in the laundry room and a Colombian man wandering the embassy's basement.

'A scandal in our foreign service is a stain on the country's name. Diplomatic missions are sacred,' Honduran lawmaker Rodolfo Zelaya reportedly said.

A special commission appointed to investigate the incident is still at work, but initial findings have already led to Andino's resignation - ratified Saturday - and he wasn't even present at the shindig.

A Stain on Honduras' Name: The nation's Foreign Ministry referred to the incident in such a dramatic manner in accepting Andino's forced resignation

'In order to safeguard national interests and good relations with the Republic of Colombia, we asked for the ambassador's irrevocable resignation and Mr Rodriguez stepped down, effective immediately,' Agence Presse France quoted the the Honduran foreign ministry as saying.

The Honduran daily newspaper, El Heraldo, reportedly quoted sources in Bogota as saying the night began innocently enough with Mendoza engaging in some holiday hijinks on the town.

The randy revelers reportedly  returned to the embassy about 11pm, regrouped - and then once again alighted on to Bogota's streets.

It was there that Mendoza and company apparently contracted a cadre of sex workers - El Heraldo put the number at 'several' - whom they then squired back to the mission.

Then the profligate party got really riotous.

Before the blowout reportedly concluded in the wee hours of the morning, or about 5 a.m., the prostitutes snatched computers and cell phones from the embassy.

One even defecated on Andino's desk, as well as the commercial attache's workstation, after being asked to leave without  the required remuneration.

El Heraldo also reported there was evidence of an orgy in the building, although calls placed by The Guardian to the embassy in Bogota went un-returned as of Sunday.

Colombian Police Col. Jose Elias Baquero said authorities are searching for what he describes as two 'contracted women' who attended the party.

Scene of the Crime: At least two computers - as well as some phones - are missing from the Honduran Embassy in the Colombian capitol city of Bogota

Terrible: One sex worker defecated on Andino's desk, as well as that of the commercial attache, after being asked to leave without remuneration

The fallout is still raining on the small Central American country.

The Guardian Newspaper of Britain reports that El Heraldo splashed its story concerning the party on its front page with an article aptly entitled, 'Diplomatic scandal: prostitutes and drunkenness in Bogotá.'

The 'embarrassing incident,' according to the paper, could have compromised sensitive information on organised crime and drug trafficking,' El Heraldo reportedly wrote in its pages.

'This means that any drug lord … could have paid a prostitute to seduce the ambassador's friend to gain access to the embassy and steal vital information about investigations.'

Colombia is the world's most prolific producer of cocaine and Honduras has become a hub for much of the drug supply headed for the U.S.

Dangerous Game: El Heraldo has suggested that such security lapses could have allowed a Colombian drug lord to infiltrate the embassy's databanks

Police col. Baquero said Honduran officials have confirmed that there was a party in which the portable computers were stolen, but that they prefer to handle the matter internally.

The U.S. Secret Service was embroiled in a similar scandal involving prostitutes and its agents last April in the Colombian city of Cartagena, where President Barack Obama attended the Summit of the Americas.

More than two dozen Secret Service agents and military personnel, tasked with preparing security for Obama's high-profile visit, were sent home. Nine have since left the agency as it seeks to repair its tarnished reputation..
