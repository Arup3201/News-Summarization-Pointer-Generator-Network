Great players with baggage like Yaya Toure are always worth the aggro when they are on top of their game. But when their form dips and yet they remain high maintenance, there is only ever one outcome.

It happened to Roy Keane whose tantrums and outbursts were tolerated by Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United until the moment he no longer justified his place in the team.

After the embarrassing mis-match in the Nou Camp when Barcelona could have scored at least six against Manchester City, you feel that time is rapidly running out for Toure and others like Vincent Kompany and Edin Dzeko. This summer will surely see a major transfusion of personnel at the Etihad if they are to challenge Europe's best.

Toure became the Premier League's best-paid player when he signed for Roberto Mancini from Barcelona in 2010. In domestic football, he has been an unqualified success and scored 24 goals last season as City won their second championship. His world-class strike against Sunderland at Wembley won Manuel Pellegrini the Capital One Cup.

When things were rosy, the club were happy to overlook constant talk about him being linked with other clubs, his pushiness to secure improved contracts and a farcical stand-off about not being treated with enough respect on his birthday.

Premier League managers felt the midfielder didn't do enough of the hard yards to protect City defensively but they were unable to capitalise much because when Yaya had the ball he was an unstoppable force of nature.

But those days have gone and the 31-year-old's hapless showing against Barcelona as City crashed out of the Champions League underlined he is not the man to push the club forward any more.

His dereliction of duty to allow Ivan Rakitic the space to score Barca's winner was noted immediately. Going forward, his shooting was wayward and he was taken off before the end by Pellegrini – unthinkable one or two years ago. Remember, Toure had been banned for the previous three games in Europe and this was his big chance to show the world what he was still capable of.

The club are in no hurry to offer the current African Player of the Year a new deal at anything like the £240,000-a-week terms of his last contract. 

Indeed, with Financial Fair Play now increasingly important, the temptation to offload him and his wages to Inter Milan this summer to allow new blood is very tempting.

City's failure to reach Europe's last eight under their Abu Dhabi owners will create a major rethink at the club this summer. All their marquee names like Sergio Aguero and David Silva were signed before Pellegrini's arrival in 2013.

While their rivals are signing young, hungry, world-class players like Eden Hazard, Alexis Sanchez and Philippe Coutinho, City looked ageing and stilted in the Nou Camp.

Toure symbolises the malaise but he's not the only one. Skipper Vincent Kompany has been off the boil all season and can no longer lead while his personal form is so patchy. 

At 30 years old, Pablo Zabaleta is still able to cope with run-of-the-mill league games but it's interesting he has been left out of the really big matches like Chelsea away and Barcelona away.

Edin Dzeko isn't going to get any better, neither is Martin Demichelis or Aleksandar Kolarov. If they stay at City, they will only be squad players and in the case of Dzeko in particular his wages are astronomical compared with strikers at other clubs.

The new signings from Txiki Begiristain have been flops. Fernando, Eliaquim Mangala and Wilfried Bony cost £72million and yet none of them are considered good enough to start.

Stevan Jovetic, a young and skilful import from Serie A, has fallen so far down the pecking order he was sacrificed from City's Champions League squad, reduced as an FPP punishment.

It is such a far cry from the excitement of the first few years under Sheik Mansour. He broke the British transfer record on his first day and while Robinho didn't work out, it did create a buzz around the place.

Aguero, Silva and Toure were dazzling signings. City need to get back to that and go for the likes of Raheem Sterling, Gareth Bale and Arjen Robben if they are going to threaten clubs like Barcelona.

It means a major clearout this summer and Toure could well be on the list.
