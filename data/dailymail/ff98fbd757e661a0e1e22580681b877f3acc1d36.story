Eurosceptics who want Britain to leave the EU have been branded ‘unpatriotic’ by Nick Clegg.

The Deputy Prime Minister tore into the Conservatives and the UK Independence Party who want to sever ties with the European Union, claiming it would leave many people ‘poorer’ and the country as a whole ‘weaker’.

In a co-ordinated Lib Dem strike, Treasury minister Danny Alexander also claimed 'if you are anti-Europe, you are anti-business, anti-growth' after multimillionaire Paul Sykes vowed to do ‘whatever it takes’ to bankroll Ukip’s campaign machine for next year’s Euro elections.

National interest: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said it was 'unpatriotic' to argue Britain should leave the EU

Europe has become one of the deepest fault lines in the coalition since David Cameron vowed to negotiate a new deal with Brussels before staging an in-out referendum by 2017.

Mr Clegg has vowed to campaign to remain in the EU, and claimed it is the ‘patriotic’ thing to do.

Ukip is already tipped to win the elections to the European Parliament in May next year.

But Eurosceptic businessman Mr Sykes, who used to be a Conservative Party backer, is promising to use part of his £650million fortune to raise the part’s profile still further.

He said: ‘We’re merely using our money to engage the British public in a subject that I think’s very important to them and all we’re basically doing is taking opinion polls and finding out that two-thirds of the British people want certain things – it’s not happening.

Eurosceptics are 'anti-business and anti-growth', the top Lib Dem at the Treasury claimed last night.

In a speech to 200 business leaders, Danny Alexander claimed anti-Europeans were failing to act in the national interest.

Speaking
 to the City Network this evening, Mr Alexander said: 'The anti-European
 tendency is set on forcing Britain out of the European Union.

'The consequence would be to throw away these huge economic advantages.

'There is an anti-Europe alliance that has a loud voice, including a large and growing chunk of the Conservative party.

My message is simple: If you are anti-Europe, you are anti-business, anti-growth, acting against the best interests of your country. Imagine if the Conservative party were in government by themselves. 

'The anti-Europe faction really would call the tune, and Britain would be irrevocably damaged.'

‘And I intend to help them to make that happen so they, the people, will decide hopefully,’ he told BBC Radio 4.

But Mr Clegg used his monthly press conference yesterday to accuse anyone who wants to leave the EU of being unpatriotic.

He said: ‘I think the view represented by Ukip, large parts of the Conservative Party and Paul Sykes is a betrayal of the national interest and an unpatriotic approach.

'It would leave many people poorer, it would leave us weaker as a country and it would throw many people out of work, and I can't possibly see why anyone thinks that that is something that in any way represents the long-term national interest.’

Mr Clegg said he was ‘relishing the opportunity of taking on eurosceptics in next year's European elections’ and would campaign to stay in the EU.

He added: ‘The Conservative Party seems to me to be flirting with exit altogether, and the Labour Party seems to have lost the courage of its own convictions on Europe.

‘Ukip represents the view that we should yank ourselves out of the European Union, with all the disastrous consequences for millions of people whose jobs and livelihoods depend on membership of that club

‘I relish the opportunity to stake our claim in this debate on the opposite side of the debate and say “Yes, the EU needs to be reformed, yes, it needs to be modernised, yes, it might take decisions sometimes with which I don't agree and can be frustrating. But overall in a footloose, fancy-free globalised world where we can't deal with crime that crosses borders, environment that crosses borders, huge trade flows that crosses borders other than by doing it with other countries, we are stronger together and weaker apart”.

‘I'm relishing the opportunity to make that patriotic case.’

Although the European elections are a poor indicator of performance in Westminster elections, there is heightened concern among Tories that a strong showing by Ukip next year will give them renewed momentum going into the general election.

Attacks: Ukip leader Nigel Farage dismissed Mr Clegg's remarks as proof the pro-EU establishment are worried

While few expect them to take any 
seats at Westminster, many Tories fear that they will draw enough votes 
to deny the Conservatives any chance of an overall majority.

Ukip
 leader Nigel Farage said: ‘These ridiculous comments from Mr Clegg 
demonstrate just how worried the pro-EU establishment are becoming.

‘The
 news that Paul Sykes will be supporting the UKIP European Election 
campaign clearly has them worried and already we're seeing pathetic 
attacks of this nature.’

If Tory voters in some areas to Ukip it could make it easier for Labour and the Lib Dems to win crunch seats.

Donation: Wealthy businessman Paul Sykes is promising to donate millions to Ukip

Mr Sykes was a backer of the Conservatives under Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s but broke with the party in 1991 over John Major’s stance on the Maastricht Treaty.

In 2000 he briefly returned to the Tory fold under William Hague only to be expelled the following year over his hardline views on Europe.

He said that he hoped success for Ukip in next year’s election would compel the other parties to accede to calls for an early referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU.

Tory support in the North has dropped further and the party is set to fare as badly there as in Scotland, a poll reveals. Its support in the region has dropped from 31 per cent to 29 per cent, with Labour strengthening to 35 per cent.

The ICM Wisdom Index asks voters to predict how well a party will do, rather than asking how they will vote.

Mr Sykes told LBC Radio he had not voted nationally since 1992, adding: ‘What’s the use? The government of Britain doesn’t reside in Britain.

'I’ve voted in the European elections but the rest are meaningless. They are not going to change the way we are governed. Every day life is controlled from Brussels.’
