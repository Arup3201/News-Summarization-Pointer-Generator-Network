If you want to make sure your Christmas cards arrive on time, spending an extra 10p on a first class stamp seems like the obvious thing to do.

But you’ll be wasting your money, a consumer champion warned yesterday – because of a little known get-out clause in Royal Mail’s delivery targets.

The rules, laid down by the regulator Ofcom, state that Royal Mail must aim to deliver 93 per cent of first class post on the next working day. But between December 2 and December 31, these rules are scrapped.

Last year, only one in two Christmas cards posted first class arrived the next working day, although Royal Mail beat its target between April and September.

In fact, over the festive period, second class post is typically more reliable. Under the regulator’s rules, Royal Mail must aim to deliver 98.5 per cent of second class letters within three working days.

Last Christmas, it achieved a rate of 93.1 per cent – yet second class stamps are 10p cheaper than first class, which currently cost a record high of 60p.

Robert Hammond, director of postal policy at Consumer Futures, the watchdog which published the research, said ‘cheaper second class’ post is a ‘super savers tip’.

His advice came as Royal Mail promised that postal workers will not strike over ‘the whole of the Christmas trading period’.

Yesterday’s announcement triggered a sharp jump in the firm’s share price, which closed yesterday at an all-time high of £5.90.

That’s 80 per cent higher than when it was privatised last month, further fuelling fears that the company was sold too cheaply. The low price has been widely criticised by MPs, amid fears the sale has robbed the taxpayer of billions of pounds. Bankers involved in the flotation told MPs on the

Business Select Committee the strike threat was the main reason the shares were priced as low as £3.30.

James Robertson, managing director of UBS, said: ‘It [the strike threat] was the most significant factor in terms of the pricing of the deal.’

Richard Cormack, managing director of Goldman Sachs, said: ‘I would say at that point, as we have just discussed, the threat of industrial action and the fact that the strike ballot was due just after the closing of the original timetable was a factor.’

But Royal Mail and the Communication Workers’ Union have finally reached a deal following marathon talks, which began last year, about workers’ pay, pensions and terms and conditions.

No details of the agreement were published yesterday because they must first be considered by the CWU’s bosses and be agreed by its members in a ballot.

A Royal Mail spokesman said: ‘The CWU has confirmed that there will be no disruption through industrial action during the ratification process of the proposed agreement, including the whole of the Christmas trading period.’

This year the last posting date for second class mail is December 18. For first class it is December 20, and for the more expensive ‘special delivery guaranteed’ service it is December 23.
