New England Patriots football player Aaron Hernandez is to face trial for a double drive-by shooting in 2015, a judge ruled on Tuesday.

The former tight end, who is accused of shooting dead two men in 2012, smiled and looked relaxed in court as he chatted to his attorney before the hearing.

His lawyers have asked Judge Jeffrey Locke to issue a gag order to prevent anyone involved in the case from commenting outside court.

Relaxed: NFL star Aaron Hernandez smiles in court on Tuesday. A trial date of May 2015 has been set for the murder trial the former New England Patriots football player is facing

Victims: Safiro Furtado, left, and Daniel de Abreu, right, were shot dead in a drive-by shooting in 2012

Attorney James Sultan said the defense was concerned that Hernandez would be unable to get a fair trial because of extensive coverage of his indictment in the double shooting of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado after a random encounter in a nightclub.

Hernandez is also facing charges over the murder of semi-professional football player Odin Lloyd, who was shot dead in June last year.

He has pleaded not guilty to all charges in both cases.

'I think it's incumbent upon all of us ... to do whatever we can to safeguard Mr Hernandez's constitutional right to a fair trial and a jury that has not been poisoned by unfairly prejudicial pretrial publicity,' Sultan said.

He argued that a judge in Bristol County, where Hernandez is charged with killing Lloyd, had issued a gag order in that case.

Prosecutors opposed the request. Assistant District Attorney Patrick Haggan called a gag order 'unreasonable' and 'unwarranted' and said it not the usual practice in Suffolk County.

Haggan said Hernandez's lawyers were suggesting that 'because of his celebrity and his public figure status that Mr Hernandez should not be held to the rules of this court'.

Haggan said prosecutors involved in the Hernandez case had not made any improper statements outside court.

Sultan disagreed, saying that District Attorney Dan Conley had 'held a press conference' after the indictments against Hernandez were issued and again after he was arraigned.

The judge took the request under advisement and did not indicate when he would rule.

Locke made it clear that the May 28 trial date is only tentative. He acknowledged that the date could change because Hernandez's trial in Lloyd's killing is scheduled for October.
