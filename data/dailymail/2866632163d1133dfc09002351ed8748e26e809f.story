He played just twice competitively for Liverpool, however, and has moved to the John Smith's Stadium in search of first team football.

Coady had travelled to the US on Liverpool's tour, and he made four appearances for the Reds in pre-season. 

The central midfielder has represented England at every level from Under-16s through to Under-20s.
