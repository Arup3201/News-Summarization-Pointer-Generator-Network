GIRL IN THE DARK

by Anna Lyndsey

(Bloomsbury £16.99)

Can you imagine what it would be like suddenly to become so acutely sensitive to light that you had to exist in a totally blacked-out room?

How would you cope if the glow of a computer screen, the flicker of a TV or the glimmer of sunlight made your skin burn to the point of agony?

How would you survive, mentally and emotionally, if your life became reduced to a blacked-out room — a ‘lair’ — from which you might crawl at night, but only if shrouded in layers of clothing even then?

That is what Lyndsey (a pen name) has had to endure since 2005. She was enjoying a successful career as a civil servant, a new flat, a thriving social scene — and then her life was knocked sideways.

One day, she noticed that, when she sat at her computer, her face burned. It became worse. Within a year, her entire body had developed a mysterious sensitivity to light, with no diagnosis and, therefore, no likelihood of a cure.

This is an extraordinary memoir of horror, endurance, resourcefulness and despair. It is also a love story — because without her boyfriend (now husband) Pete, it is impossible to see how Lyndsey would have survived.

Their relationship was relatively new when her problems began and, realising she could no longer live alone, Lyndsey asked if she could move into his house.

He said yes. They plan one wedding, call it off (for medical reasons), then get married in 2007, at the end of a December day. She writes, ‘my love has saved me’, yet feels torn between her need for Pete and the knowledge that ‘I am sucking the light from Pete’s life, leaving him a twilit, liminal creature, single yet not single, who at social events sits alone among couples, a strange absent presence always at his side’.

She wrestles with the knowledge that she is ‘occupying this lovely man, while giving him neither children nor a public companion nor a welcoming home’ — but she sets that gloomy truth against their mutual love: ‘The miracle which I live with, every day.’

Lyndsey structures the memoir with inventive skill, in a series of short chapters that flash backwards and forwards, so that, sometimes, you lose your sense of time — just like the narrator, imprisoned in her dark room.

The detail can be full of gallows humour. In October 2005, Lyndsey is travelling by train to see a dermatologist, ‘wearing a dark red coat, an oversized hat with a big peak and a mask . . . cut from a dark red satin scarf, using a double layer for improved light protection . . .’

The woman opposite her glares suspiciously, and then ‘picks up her child and walks to the other end of the carriage’.

Remember, this is just three months after the 7/7 bombings and, masked like Michael Jackson, Lyndsey looks bizarre. Such episodes are entertaining — even as they make you catch your breath in empathy.

Lyndsey enjoys talking books (the more exciting the better), but listening to music is too heart-breaking — even though both her parents were professional musicians and she plays the piano herself.

The list of all the alternative therapies she has tried is almost funny. At one point, a healer has the nerve to tell her there can be ‘a benefit to having an illness’ — and the girl in the dark wants to leap up ‘and smash the woman in the face’. She points out, very wisely, that some people have ‘an obsessive need to find meaning and pattern in human lives’.

They cannot accept that something so randomly terrible can happen to another human being — whereas, of course, the proofs of ‘casual brutality’ come every day.

Yet the sheer joy Lyndsey finds in a thoughtful present from her husband (a draught excluder in the shape of a funny sheep with long, spread legs), as well as the wisdom accrued from her ordeal, is evidence of that power within the human spirit that keeps hoping — with every breath.

Girl In The Dark is beautifully written. The author’s intelligence shines on every page, and her will to survive (despite those black thoughts in her dark room) is inspiring.

The miracle of the girl in the dark is the generosity that illuminates the lives of others by sharing her story.
