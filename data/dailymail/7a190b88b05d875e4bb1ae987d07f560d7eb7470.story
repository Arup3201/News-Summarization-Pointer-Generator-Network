Disgraced governor Mark Sanford begged his ex wife to run his congressional campaign - four years after she caught him cheating on her with an Argentinian journalist.

The love-cheat politician made the offer to Jenny Sanford after he announced his push for South Carolina's open seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in January,  amid speculation that she planned to run for the same office herself, according to the New York magazine.

But Ms Sanford, who acted as his campaign manager for free while the pair were married, is understood to have turned him down, preferring to instead continue 'serving on the boards of various charities'.

'According to Jenny,' the publication reported, 'she had already told Mark she would be taking a 
pass on the race the day before, at the funeral of a mutual friend.

'So 
when Mark came to visit her, he arrived with a proposal. “Since you’re 
not running, I want to know if you’ll run my campaign,” he said. “We 
could put the team back together.”

'Jenny told him, in so many words, that wasn’t going to happen. Mark made one last appeal.

'“I could pay you this time,” he said.'

The South Carolina seat was left 
vacant by Tim Scott when he was appointed to the Senate. Scott replaced 
Sen. Jim DeMint, who left the Capitol this month to run The Heritage 
Foundation, a Washington-based think tank.

Mark Sanford once held the House seat himself, from 1995 to 2001. He did not run for reelection in 2000 and instead ran for governor. Sanford won the 2002 gubernatorial election and was successfully reelected in 2006.

He was once thought to be a potential
 2012 presidential contender, but his political aspirations were dashed 
when he was caught cheating on his wife in 2009.

The scandal surfaced after Sanford, a father of four, mysteriously vanished on June 18, 2009 for six days.

Sanford had told his staff that he 
had gone hiking on the Appalachian Trail, but in reality, he was off in 
Buenos Aires cavorting with his Argentinian mistress, Maria Belen 
Chapur.

His hiking story eventually foiled and his affair was revealed. 

He later admitted to visiting Chapur and said Chapur was his 'soul mate.'

'I've been unfaithful to my wife,' Sanford said at the time. 'I developed a relationship with what started as a dear, dear friend from Argentina.'

Sanford said he wanted to try and mend his relationship with Jenny, his wife of 21 years, but she filed for divorce shortly thereafter. 

Sanford's affair didn't stop him from seeing out the end of his term for governor after South Carolina lawmakers unsuccessfully called for his impeachment following the revelations. 

He was eventually forced to pay $74,000 in ethics fines after the state ethics commission discovered Sanford's use of state planes and campaign cash to orchestrate his affair.
