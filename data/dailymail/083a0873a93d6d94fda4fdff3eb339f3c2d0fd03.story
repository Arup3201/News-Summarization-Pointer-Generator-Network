A teacher was almost paralysed after he was battered by pupils in two separate attacks at a school where staff are spat at and abused 'on a daily basis'.

Mark Freestone, 51, suffered horrific injuries and was left unable to walk after he was assaulted by a 13-year-old boy with a metal scooter at Denewood Learning Centre in Nottingham.

The father-of-two was off work for five weeks with a slipped disc after the attack, but just days after returning he suffered an identical injury while restraining a 13-year-old pupil who tried to bite him.

Mr Freestone, who has 26 years teaching experience, revealed  that his colleagues had suffered years of physical abuse including one who had their hair set on fire.

He said: 'There have been a lot of staff that have been assaulted over the years. Someone had their neck twisted.

'A 13-year-old child came into school with a metal scooter and was swinging it above his head, smashing furniture and attacking the head teacher with it.

'Myself and the site manager intervened to get hold of the scooter and we had to take hold of him and take him away down the corridor.

'I stood in front of him when it appeared he had calmed down and he then went straight for me and pushed me down and at that moment I felt my back go, the pain was excruciating and I have never felt anything like it.

Just days after returning to school following the attack in May 2013, he suffered similar injuries after restraining a pupil who had tried to bite him

'I went to hospital and they diagnosed a prolapsed disc in the base of my spine.'

The attack was among dozens at the Pupil Referral Unit which caters for 64 pupils aged 7-14 who have been excluded from other schools around Nottinghamshire.

It has been placed in special measures following a damning Ofsted report which found staff were abused, attacked and spat at on a daily basis.

Nottinghamshire Police confirmed they were called to the school 56 times last year. 

When Mr Freestone returned to work after the attack a new student was brought into his class who punched him in the face after just two hours.  

'He was the worst student I have ever seen. He was completely violent,' said Mr Freestone.

'On the first day he was in my class I asked him to take his hat and sunglasses off and he punched me in the face.

'We called his parents into the school and we sent him home and agreed to start again the next day but he came for me and tried to bite me.

'As I restrained him on the floor I felt my back go again. I was helpless because he kept on biting me and scratching me.

'I had to go back to the doctor but this time I had an X-ray and it showed that a disc in my back had popped out and it was one of the worst cases of the injury they had seen.

'It was so bad I couldn't walk.' 

He made more than 10 complaints to schools watchdog Ofsted about violence at the school before handing in his notice in December.

'It was common for the staff to just break down and cry because of everything that was going on,' he said.

'When I complained about the problems I got told that there wasn't a magic wand to fix things. No one listened to my concerns. Staff are going through hell in that place.' 

Both boys are still being taught at the school and no charges have been brought.

A police spokesman  said: 'Nottinghamshire Police has a duty of care to protect all children living and studying in the county.

'Nottinghamshire Police can confirm that a referral to the education authority in relation to this was made in October.'

Sarah Fielding, director of education at the city council, said: 'Teaching at a Pupil Referral Unit is one of the most challenging jobs in the teaching profession.

'But no teacher or student should ever be put into an unsafe environment.

'We know this situation is clearly unacceptable and urgent improvement is needed.

'We have applied to the Secretary of State to give the council the powers we need to intervene at the school.

'This will enable us to put a new governing body in place to make rapid improvements.'
