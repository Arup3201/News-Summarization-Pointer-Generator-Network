Jose Mourinho paid a fitting tribute to the career of recently retired star Thierry Henry while revealing the only moment he 'didn't enjoy' during the Frenchman's time at Arsenal.

In 2004, Henry caught Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech unawares while organising his wall with a quickly taken free-kick during the 2-2 Premier League draw.

Referee Graham Poll allowed the goal to stand despite protestations from the Chelsea bench as the two team battled it out for the title.

Speaking firstly of Henry's decision, Mourinho said: 'I read with some emotion his reaction.

'I'm always very sad when the big players stop their careers. But, at the same time, when I read about his wonderful journey and the way he enjoyed his career, and the way he looks forward for the rest of his life, I'm happy.

'I think he's a very happy guy, very proud of everything he did. I think he looks forward to the new steps in his life, always connected with football for sure.

'I just want to thank him for the great moments he gave to all of us. 

'Only one moment I didn't enjoy, which was the goal he scored against us when Mr Poll allowed him to take the free-kick when everyone was still preparing.

'Even in that moment he showed how intelligent he was playing football. So thanks for everything he gave to us, and we wish him the best for the future.'
