A New Jersey school bus driver who left two special needs children alone on a bus for nearly an hour in 90-degree weather has been sentenced to three years of probation.

Kimberly Moumblow, 47, of Highland Lakes reportedly left two special needs boys, age seven and nine, on a school bus for 45 minutes in July 2013 with the door shut and the windows rolled up, authorities say.

The bus was reportedly not running.

Judge Thomas J. Critchley also ordered Moumblow to pay various fines and undergo a mental health evaluation, The New Jersey Herald reports.

In November 2014, Moumblow pleaded guilty to cruelty and fourth-degree neglect of a child in the incident.

Moumblow reportedly skipped two of her three planned stops that July 23 day and, after driving the school bus to the Hamburg-based private bus company Macnova parking area, she left the vehicle without realizing the two boys were still inside, according to the Herald. 

According to NJ, Moumblow backed the bus into the company owner's home before leaving the children unattended in the vehicle in the 90-degree weather. 

Authorities have said the children were overheated and distressed, but were not seriously injured.

The boys were found after their parents contacted the school, asking where the boys were, the Herald reports.  

The school board called the bus company, contracted to transport summer program students, and, when they couldn't reach the company, they contacted the police, CBS reports. 

Officers found the bus outside of the company owner's home, and CBS reports, that the company told school district officials that the children were on an air-conditioned bus and being attended to by an adult. 

Authorities soon learned that was not the case. 

Unacceptable: Charles Maranzano (photographed) described the situation as 'complete neglect,' saying Moumblow's actions were 'unacceptable and incomprehensible'

'I just want to say that I am sorry to the families, Moumblow said before her sentencing. 

'Anything I say will sound like an excuse, but what happened was inexcusable.'

Charles Maranzano, superintendent of Vernon Township schools, described the situation to CBS as 'complete neglect,' saying Moumblow's actions were 'unacceptable and incomprehensible.'

Though Moumblow said what happened was 'inexcusable,' the woman, who had a special license to drive a bus for nearly a decade, said she could offer no explanation other than personal issues involving her own children and a prior marriage, according to the Herald. 

Moumblow will face the probation, evaluation, and fines although the fourth-degree crime of neglect of a child carries a potential weight of up to 18 months in jail, NJ reports.

The school district has since fired the Macnova bus company, according to the Herald, and Moumblow is no longer allowed to work with children.
