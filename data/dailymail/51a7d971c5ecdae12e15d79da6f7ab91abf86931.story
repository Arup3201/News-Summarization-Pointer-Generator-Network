Dave Lee Travis yesterday told of his fury at being 'sullied' by association with the Jimmy Savile child abuse investigation.

The former Radio 1 DJ denied any wrongdoing after being released by police investigating accusations of sexual assault made by two women dating back to the late-1960s.

He said the case against him amounted to nothing more than allegations of 'fumbling', adding: 'I do not want to be sucked into anything that talks about paedophilia.'

Throng: The radio DJ came out holding an audio recorder to record the words he said to gathered journalists

Denial: Former Radio 1 DJ Dave Lee Travis denied being a paedophile as he spoke to reporters outside his home

Standing at the gate of his £1million
home, he told reporters: 'I've been talking to the police about sexual –
I don't know what to call it – in the old days they called it putting 
your arm around someone and giving them a cuddle.

'I think that sometimes us guys who 
are a bit older are, shall we say, tactile – which is not a terrible 
thing to be. In the old days you put your arm round someone and gave 
them a kiss or a cuddle, yeah, that's fine. Nowadays you'd have to stop 
to think – is this an assault?

'Now I'm not saying that I haven't put
my arms around someone and I'm not saying that any of this is right or 
wrong at the moment. But I'm just trying to get the facts out...'

The 67-year-old DJ continued: 'Things were different in those days…Those were lax days.'

Several claims have already been made 
that Travis groped women colleagues in the 1970s and 1980s. TV and radio
broadcaster Vivien Creegor claimed he 'jiggled her breasts' while live 
on Radio 4 in the 1980s.

Mrs Creegor, 55, claimed Travis 
clamped his hands over her jumper as she made a live announcement. 
Travis categorically denied any wrongdoing and said he was surprised the
allegations were being made now.

Upset: DJ Travis came out of his house in Bedfordshire and said he spoke out because he didn't want to be 'linked to something that bloody evil'

He said: 'We are not talking about 
rape or attack or anything like that. It's not as if someone has to keep
this quiet. If something like that happened you say, “Hey, he grabbed 
my boobs”. You'd tell somebody.'

He added: 'Of course I've groped women's breasts, Jesus Christ I'm a man. Women have groped me as well. This is what happens.

Anxious: Dave Lee Travis said he had to speak out because he did not want to be mentioned in the same breath as Jimmy Savile

'I'm a human being I'm a man. But I have never walked up to a woman and groped her without her knowing.'

The former DJ's main anger was the way
his arrest had been linked to the investigation into paedophilia 
involving some of his fellow former celebrities.

He said: 'My name appeared in papers 
alongside Gary Glitter and Jimmy Savile – that's not on.' He added: 
'This is nothing to do with kids, all right? I don't want to be even 
mentioned in the same breath as Savile.'

He said he had no warning that he was 
about to be arrested at his home in a small village in Buckinghamshire 
at just before 8am on Thursday.

He spent over 12 hours at the station where he drank hot chocolate and ate a cheese and tomato sandwich.

He said he had given the opposite of a
'no comment' interview. 'It's not my style. I have lots of comment. I 
answered every question they asked me.'

Yesterday it was announced that Travis
has been taken 'off air with immediate effect' by radio station Magic 
AM after his arrest.

A spokesman for Bauer Media which owns
Magic AM said: 'While we can make no judgment on the matters under 
investigation, we believe it would be inappropriate for him to broadcast
until they are resolved.'

Police said the allegations against 
Travis did not directly involve Savile, and were classed under the 
strand of their investigation termed 'others'.

÷ Two more celebrities are to face legal action from Lord McAlpine for falsely implying he was a paedophile on Twitter.

The unnamed pair join Sally Bercow and
Guardian columnist George Monbiot, and each could be forced to pay the 
peer up to £100,000 for spreading untrue gossip.

Statement: The DJ, who has been suspended by Magic AM, said that he is accused of 'jiggling' the breasts of two 'grown women'

The mammoth payouts would reflect the fact that the four prolific Twitter users have hundreds of thousands of followers.

The Speaker's wife has already been 
sent a letter by the wronged peer's lawyers urging her to apologise and 
agree a damages settlement, it is understood.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
