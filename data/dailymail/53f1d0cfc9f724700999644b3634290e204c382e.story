With David Gandy, Daisy Lowe and Laura Whitmore all on hand to celebrate, the Rodial Beautiful Awards boasted one of the most glamorous guest lists of the year so far.

Others joining the celebrations at the St Martin's Lane Hotel included designer Julien MacDonald, seemingly intent on starting a new trend for man clutches, and the ever-glamorous Kelly Hoppen.

And if that wasn't enough, Team Femail was there to collect an award for Most Addictive Website. Here's the lowdown from MailOnline's big night.

THE GUESTLIST

A veritable who's who of London's most stylish, guests included the gorgeous David Gandy (who happily posed for a photo with an even happier Team Femail), presenter Laura Whitmore and model Jodie Kidd.

Joining them was Maria Hatzistefanis, the brains behind Rodial and its sister brand Nip+Fab, Femail's favourite designer Julien MacDonald and Jo Wood.

Outside the hotel, the assembled paps were thrilled when Daisy Lowe, Donna Air and Pixie Lott sashayed in, each looking thoroughly glamorous.

THE DRINKS

Lychee and champagne cocktails got the party off to a good start, while wine and plenty of mineral water (it was a school night!) kept spirits up during the ceremony.

At supper, guests tucked into healthy chicken and coconut rice steamed in a banana leaf followed by fruit salad topped with moreish banana sorbet.

THE AWARD

Established by Maria Hatzistefanis in 2010, the Rodial Beautiful Awards were set up to celebrate women of beauty, style and elegance.

Winners on the night included Daisy Lowe who took home the Woman of the Year gong and Pixie Lott who looked thrilled to be handed the Most Stylish Award.

But no-one was quite so thrilled as Team Femail who took the trophy for Most Addictive Site (currently occupying pride of place at Daily Mail HQ), which was presented by Jodie Kidd.

Talking about why MailOnline deserved the trophy, the model said: 'This award is being given to the best online title whose global audience reflects their strength in journalism and the break neck speed in which they work.

'[It is] followed by all Rodial customers and employees, and be warned: It is highly addictive.'

Other winners included Jameela Jamil was presented with The Edgy look Award by Ronnie Wood’s ex Jo, who looked stunning in a sheer top with tuxedo style jacket.

Olivia Grant, who stood out in her lace red dress, took home the award for Vital Beauty, while Man Of The Year  went to slightly bewildered David Gandy.

Other awards went to Nadine Baggot, who won Beauty Editor Of The Year and the Sunday Times' Style magazine, which sent the very lovely Edwina Ings-Chambers to pick up their trophy for Most Influential Page award.
