For the next installment in the burgeoning Clinton-Bush, post-presidency love-in, George W. joined Bill at the NCAA men's basketball final in Arlington, Texas on Monday evening to watch UConn triumph 60-54 over the Wildcats.

Despite being political foes, the Bush and Clinton clans have become increasingly friendly while out of office - no more so than George H.W Bush and Bill  - who have headed to relief efforts in Haiti and after the 2005 Asian tsunami.

'My husband, Bill Clinton and I have become friends. And Bill visits us every summer. We don’t agree politically, but we don’t talk politics,' Barbara Bush told C-SPAN last year.

Having fun: Former presidents Bill Clinton, left, and George W. Bush watch action between Connecticut and Kentucky during the first half of the NCAA Final Four tournament college basketball championship game on Monday, April 7, 2014, in Arlington, Texas

Former President Bill Clinton 
initially took a back seat to his successor during the national anthem 
at the NCAA championship game.

But
 once the game began, Clinton and former President George W. Bush 
gathered in the same row and sat next to each other in the luxury box 
belonging to Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones at AT&T Stadium along with Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo.

They
 laughed while their images were being shown on the giant stadium video 
boards, and drew applause from the crowd during a break in the first 
half.

Former first lady Laura Bush was also in attendance for the title game between Kentucky and Connecticut.

Both former presidents are noted sports fans, and Bush, is a regular attendee at Texas sporting events.

The former presidents have indeed spent a lot of time together recently.

Earlier this year, George W. and Bill, along with Hilary and Laura shared a trip on Air Force One when they traveled to the memorial service for Nelson Mandela.

And the two former leader's of the free world reveled in a hotly contested game that witnessed Shabazz Napier scoring 22 points as Connecticut won its second NCAA title in four years, beating all those Kentucky freshmen 60-54 in the championship game Monday night.

Napier is among three UConn seniors who were part of the Huskies' 2011 title. That trio stayed after coach Jim Calhoun's retirement even when the Huskies were ineligible for the NCAA tournament last season.

They came back strong in coach Kevin Ollie's second season, and the Huskies (32-8) went all the way to their fourth overall title.

Kentucky (29-11), with five freshmen starters, never led in the championship game.

The Wildcats missed 11 of 24 free throws, while the Huskies were perfect on 10 tries.

The Wildcats, who started with five freshmen, were aiming for their second national title in three seasons and ninth overall.

Back in Connecticut, more than 10,000 UConn students shook the stands inside Gampel Pavilion Monday night, then erupted in cheers, stormed the arena floor and poured into the streets as their men's basketball team won its fourth national championship, and second in four years.

'I'm just so happy to be a Husky right now,' said Mike Butkus, a 21-year-old senior from Naugatuck.

'So much pride. The last 20 years, you'd be hard-pressed to find a program more successful than us.'

After the victory the students came outside and onto a plaza for a dance party in the rain. The school hired a disc jockey in an effort to keep crowds of students under control. As many danced, others were hanging from trees and throwing firecrackers.

Extra campus police and state police patrolled on and around campus and several local fire companies were on standby with ambulances. Several people were helped from the arena by paramedics, apparently with alcohol-related issues.

Students said they expect the party to go on into the early morning hours.

'Hopefully I'll be able to go to class tomorrow, but I'm not certain,' said Vincent Buffa, a 21-year-old senior from Tolland.

Connecticut had won three previous championships, the last in 2011.

Forward DeAndre Daniels sparked Connecticut in its shock win over Florida on Sunday, contributing 20 points and 10 rebounds as the Huskies took control after trailing by 12 points early in the contest.

'We feel like we have been doubted the whole season,' Daniels told reporters after the big win. 'But that's what drives us ... We like to go out and try to prove people wrong.'

Guard Shabazz Napier, key to Connecticut's 65-64 victory over Florida on December 2, added 12 points and six assists and stole the ball four times from the Gators, who were the top seed in tournament.
