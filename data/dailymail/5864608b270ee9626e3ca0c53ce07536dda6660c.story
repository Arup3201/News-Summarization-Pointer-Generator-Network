Chile came back twice to earn themselves a win in a friendly at the sold-out Estadio El Teniente in Rancagua.

Six minutes after the start, USA's Brek Shea converted the first chance of the game with a powerful left-footed strike.

Almost immediately Chile midfielder Roberto Gutierrez levelled from a fine cross from Mark Gonzalez, before former Sunderland striker Jozy Altidore put the visitors ahead following some good play from Tottenham defender DeAndre Yedlin.

Gonzalez continued to terrorise the Americans, and equalised with just under 20 minutes to go after skinning Spurs full-back Yedlin.

Chile began to smell blood, and took the lead themselves on 76 minutes when Gonzalez added a third by smashing home USA goalkeeper Nick Rimando's parry.

The result will give USA boss Jurgen Klinsmann food for thought, with his side conceding nine goals in the second half of their last 5 games.
