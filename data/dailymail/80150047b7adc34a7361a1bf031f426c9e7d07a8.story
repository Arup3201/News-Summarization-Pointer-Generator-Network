A Marine veteran has been honored in a special service at his local church after being noted as the dignified presence in one of the Kennedy era's most iconic and somber images. 

Grady Thompson was captured on camera standing to attention alongside John F Kennedy's coffin as his widow, Jacqueline, and daughter Caroline knelt alongside in the United States Capitol Rotunda in Washington D.C.

Thompson, then a young Marine, had just graduated from boot camp when he was ordered to stand guard by the assassinated president's coffin on November 24, 1963.

He told Fox: 'They were looking for tall Marines, and I was a tall guy. I was ordered to stand still and look forward. 

;I knew the first lady was there, but I couldn't even see her in my field of vision.'

The retired Marine was unaware until years later that he was even part of the historic scene. 

This weekend he was honored at a special service at Anderson Mill Road Baptist Church in Moore, South Carolina.

The Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office Rifle Drill Team honored a local veteran during a special service at Anderson Mill Road Baptist Church in Moore on Sunday.

Grady Thompson, who is a former detention officer, received a special salute and was given a framed photograph of his moment in history. 

After he was assassinated in Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963, Kennedy's flag-covered casket was brought past 300,000 people in a horse-drawn caisson to lie in state at the Rotunda. 

Jacqueline Kennedy, led Caroline and John Jr, into view the coffin which lay on the Lincoln catafalque.

Hundreds of thousands of people lined up in the freezing cold to pay their respects to the late President. 

Over 18 hours, a quarter of a million people filed past, some waiting up to ten hours in line.
