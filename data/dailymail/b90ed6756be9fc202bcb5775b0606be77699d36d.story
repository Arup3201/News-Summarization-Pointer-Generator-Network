More than 7.5 million children aged under 13 lie to get around Facebook’s age restrictions.

In 2012, the social network filed a patent that would make this process more legitimate, by seeking approval from, and handing the controls of the account to, the child’s parent.

But this application was only made public last week, and has caused uproar among children's rights campaigners.

In 2012, Facebook filed a patent that would make it possible for children under 13 to set up an account, as long as they had parental approval. The application went public this week. Facebook told MailOnline 'a patent is not a predicator for future work' and denied the age limit was changing. Stock image pictured

James Steyer, chief executive of child-advocacy group Common Sense Media said: 'We don't have the proper science and social research to evaluate the potential pros and cons that social-media platforms are doing to teenagers.

According to the files (pictured), if an underage user tried to access the site, Facebook would ask for 'parental authorisation' via an existing account

'The idea that you would go after this segment of the audience when there are concerns about the current audience is mind boggling.'

According to the patent, when an underage user tries to access the site, or ‘perform actions’ on it, Facebook will ask for ‘parental authorisation from an additional user having a parental relationship to the user’.

The child would tell Facebook who their parents are before the site runs a validity check on the parent’s account to confirm the relationship, and the age of the user.

‘The online service may make these verifications based in part social and transactional information associated with the identified user's account,’ explained the files.

‘Upon successful verification, the online service allows the identified user to authorise account creation for the child user, and/or manage the account and actions of the child user.’

This means that once an underage account had been linked to a parental one, the adults would be able to limit and monitor their child’s behaviour.

They would also have complete control of the child's privacy and applications on the site.

Facebook has denied it is planning to 
launch the service, and told the MailOnline: ‘Child safety advocates, 
policymakers and companies have discussed how best to help parents keep 
their kids safe online.

The original age limit was set to comply with the 1998 Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).  Any changes would need to be approved by governing body, the Federal Trade Commission. The site was criticised in October for allowing teenagers to make public posts (pictured)

Facebook was criticised in October for letting teenagers make their posts public.

Before the update Facebook prevented under 18s making posts public; the widest audience they could reach was Friends of Friends.

In
 a blog post, Facebook said: 'Teens are among the savviest people using 
social media, and whether it comes to civic engagement, activism, or 
their thoughts on a new movie, they want to be heard.

'So, starting today, people aged 13 through 17 will also have the choice to post publicly on Facebook.'

‘Like any responsible company, we looked at ways to tackle this issue, but a patent application based on two-year-old research is not a predictor of future work in this area.’

The patent was filed in 2012, at the same time Facebook was researching how many underage children access the site.

This research was carried out after a number of child safety advocates voiced concerns about the number of children using the site.

A Consumer Reports at the time found more than 5 million children under the age of 10 were accessing Facebook and its apps and this figure is said to have held steady ever since.

The original under-13 age limit was set to comply with the 1998 Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

This act requires any companies that handle data of young children to get explicit parental consent.

Any changes to this element of Facebook’s terms and conditions would need to be approved by governing body, the Federal Trade Commission.
