Now we know what the players think - the entire NBA season will be wiped out by the lockout.

NBA Players Association chief Billy Hunter said basketball owners and players are $800million apart in crucial labour talks.

He was speaking at a conference in Baltimore, Maryland, and stated that he expects the whole 2011/12 season to be cancelled.

Mr Hunter spoke just days after the players and owners met but a new collective bargaining agreement failed to get any closer.

The controversy is over the NBA’s concern that its economic model must change because 22 of its 30 clubs are unprofitable.

The NBA also wants the players’ share of revenue to fall from 57 per cent - and Mr Hunter said the players have agreed to drop to 54 per cent.

But NBA commissioner David Stern has his hands tied in his negotiations by hard-line owners, reported the Baltimore Sun.

Mr Stern told ESPN on Tuesday that he is not yet ready to speculate if and when the two side will reach an agreement.

‘The circumstances have changed among his constituency,’ Mr Hunter said.

‘In the last six or seven years, there is a new group of owners to come in who paid a premium for their franchises, and what they're doing is kind of holding his feet to the fire.’

Asked if there will be a 2011-12 season, he said: ‘If I had to bet on it at this moment, I would probably say no.’

An NBA spokesman said the organisation has no immediate response.

The two sides are expected to meet again later this month, reported the New York Daily News.

The lockout began at the start of July and some players are already heading for the European leagues to get away from the NBA.

New Jersey Nets players Jordan Farmar, Deron Williams and Sasha Vujacic have all left the U.S. for Europe and others are expected to follow.
