Tragic: Young mother Laura Hill, who was struggling to cope with the death of her son Jayden, pictured, was found hanged

A young mother who was struggling to come to terms with the death of her baby son has been found hanged.

Friends of Laura Hill, 21, say that she was dreading Christmas without her son Jayden who died suddenly in January last year.

Police confirmed that she had walked out of a hospital where she was being treated in Pembrokeshire, Wales, and was later found dead in a nearby retail park.

Touching Facebook tributes were paid to the young mother today.

One friend posted: 'At least you are with your baby now.'

Troubled Laura had herself previously poured her heart out on her Facebook page after Jayden's death at the age of four months.

She wrote: 'Miss you so much. They say times a healer but the pain is gettign worse. I would do anything to have you back.

'If I could swap places I would. Life isn't going to be the same without you.

'Can't dexcribe how much I love and miss you.'

Laura, of Neyland, Pembrokeshire, gave birth to baby Jayden in 2010 and loved being a mum.

She had nicknamed her baby Mooey after buying him a baby gro with a cow pattern.

Laura had been admitted to a hospital in Haverfordwest for help but walked out shortly before she was found dead.

A friend said: 'It is so sad - everyone knew she was struggling but we never thought it was that bad.

'A lot of people are saying she wanted 
to be with her baby boy - maybe that was what was on her mind, 
especially at this time of year."

Health chiefs confirmed today that a full investigation has been launched into Laura's death.

A spokesman for the Hywel Dda Health Board spokesman said: 'A full investigation will take place.

'Due to patient confidentiality the health board cannot comment further at this time.'
