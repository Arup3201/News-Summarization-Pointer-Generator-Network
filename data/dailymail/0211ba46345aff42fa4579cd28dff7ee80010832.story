Andrew Palfrey, pictured outside court, sent a stream of graphic sexual threats to hospital worker Amanda Prosser

A hospital worker who was sent text rape threats by a phone stalker was 'sickened' to discover the culprit - a colleague's husband.

Amanda Prosser, 48, received a stream of graphic sexual threats over an eight week period from the husband of her workmate at Llandrindod Wells Hospital, Powys. 

A court heard victim Mrs Prosser thought father-of-two Andrew Palfrey, 50, was a friend - and they regularly went out drinking together as a foursome.

But Palfrey had a secret grudge because he felt his wife did all the work on the hospital's physiotherapy unit while Mrs Prosser was 'lazy and never in work'.

A court heard mechanic Palfrey plagued her with a barrage of 'vile and disgusting' texts over eight weeks.

The mother-of-four said: 'These message were horrendous, vile and sick. He said he was going to inject me with heroin, rape me, kidnap me and hurt me.

'They made me suspect everyone around me and made me question my friendships.

'When I discovered it was Andrew I was in shock and sickened.

'I couldn't believe the same man who I'd sat with in our local pub so many times was dreaming up so many awful things to do to me.

'I have been unable to leave the house alone and have been to the doctors as I have had trouble sleeping and been unable to go to work and had anxiety attacks.'

Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard Mrs Prosser received texts from an unknown number saying she was being watched day and night and would be rapes, maimed and turned into a prostitute.

One message told her: 'I will grab you and use you and have my fun.' Another said: 'Make the most of the time you have left with your family.'

Prosecutor Rachel Knight said the messages were serious sexual threats with warnings of abduction and rape.

She told the court: 'Those messages were extremely distressing for her.'

Palfrey was caught when police tracked his pay as you go mobile phone to a newsagents in Llanidloes, Powys, where he had bought a top up card.

They showed a CCTV image of the customer to Mrs Prosser and she identified him as her colleague's husband and a friend.

The court heard Mrs Prosser works with Palfrey's wife on the physiotherapy ward of Llandrindod Wells Hospital.

Palfrey admitted to police he had sent the messages as an act of revenge and had done it for his wife.

He told officers his wife had to do all the work because Mrs Prosser was 'lazy and never in work'.

Palfrey told police: 'I was angry because she was not pulling her weight at the hospital. I wanted to frighten her.

'It was frustrating that she was not replying to the messages and I did not know how she was reacting to them.'

The court heard Mrs Prosser had actually only been off sick for two days before he started sending the threatening sexual messages.

Palfrey, 50, of Llandrindod Wells, admitted harassment between April 4 and June 16 and was given a six month suspended prison sentence.

Judge Eleri Rees told him: 'The messages you sent were some of the worst that can be imagined - they were sinister and menacing.

'One gets the sense that you were deriving some excitement from them especially he sexual element.

'They became more elaborate and were obscene and violent. It is inexplicable why you embarked on this appalling behaviour.

'Life for Mrs Prosser and those around her must have been a living hell. How much more the shock to discover the person who was doing this she thought was a friend.

'I don't think that I have ever come across a case quite like this.'

Judge Rees praised Mrs Prosser for her 'great courage' in coming to court in person to describe how she had suffered.

Palfrey will have to complete 250 hours of unpaid work and attend a thinking skills course.

He was made the subject of an indefinite restraining order that prevents Palfrey from contacting Mrs Prosser in person or electronically.
