A mother has been accused of scorching her six-year-old son's hands on a stove and pouring salt on the burns as punishment for touching an iPad.

Karina Torrescano Hernandez, 27, was arrested on suspicion of second-degree assault of a child after the boy's wounds were spotted by a school counsellor.

Doctors found four separate burn marks which 'indicated multiple contacts, not one' and scars on his head, neck, shoulder and buttocks, according to a statement from the hospital.

'Teaching him a lesson': The boy told investigators his mother pushed his hands onto a hot spiral stove like this one then poured salt over the burns

Teachers from his elementary school in Lynnwood, Washington, were first alerted to the youngster's injuries by another student last month.

At first, the boy said he hurt himself on monkey bars in the playground, but later broke down in tears and claimed his mother had done it.

Officials found red marks on his palms that looked like they 'could have been caused by an electric stove element or something similar', according to the statement of probable cause cited on www.komonews.com.

The boy told investigators his mother wanted to teach him a lesson 'because I touched an iPad' so she held his hands over a spiral stove, then cupped his palms together and poured salt over the burns.

He and his three-year-old brother told police their mother often hit them with a spoon, a shoe or a 'witches broom'.

The boy's babysitter also claims Hernandez deliberately hurt her son 'because he had misbehaved'.

Hernandez, who was questioned with the help of an interpreter, said she believed her son had burnt his hand while trying to toast marshmallows.

She said it probably happened when she was having a nap during the day, something she often does because she works night shifts.

Offering support: Friend and neighbour Lisa Infante (pictured) says she believes the alleged incident is the result of a big misunderstanding

She claims her son hid the injuries from 
her for two days and says she did not get medical treatment because she 
was afraid the state might take him away from her.

Friend and neighbour Lisa Infante says she believes the alleged incident is the result of a big misunderstanding.

'None of us here that live here could even imagine her doing something like that to her child. She really takes really good care of her kids,' she told www.komonews.com.

Hernandez has been booked into jail on one count of domestic violence and second-degree assault of a child, it was reported on www.kirotv.com. Her bail has been set at $25,000.

The boy's hands have now healed and the two youngsters are staying with a relative.
