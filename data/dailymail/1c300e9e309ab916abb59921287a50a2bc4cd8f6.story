By her own admission, Ashley-Rae Tapping didn't 'fit in' at school.

The 24-year-old told MailOnline she stood
out growing up in Leyton, east London, with her unique sense of style
and home-made headbands.

But now the 24-year-old is making waves in the fashion world after setting up her own clothing line, Loud Culture, with friend Abi Fashesin.

Fan: Diana Vickers wore a boob tube from the Loud Culture 2011 collection in More magazine

The pair met at college, where Ashley-Rae was studying PR and journalism and Abi was a fashion student, and after launching their spring/summer 2011 then 2012 collections, Loud Culture already has a number of celeb fans.

Little Mix have worn items in photo shoots, while Diana Vickers has appeared on magazine covers in their clothes. Another X Factor finalist, Misha B, 
has performed in their designs, as have girl band Stooshe.

Ashley-Rae said it 'feels great' to 
see stars in their designs. 'We didn't think anyone would take notice of
us, so it's a dream come true to see stars like Little Mix in our 
clothes. It makes us even more determined.'

Ashley-Rae describes their clothing as 'fun and edgy', combining bold African-inspired prints with contemporary tailoring.

'We're both of African descent so wanted to wear clothing that reflects that,' she said. 'However, a lot of the clothing in African print is very baggy, and we wanted something more fitting and fun. After we left college, we both knew we wanted to work in fashion, so we thought why not set up our own clothing line?'

The pair combined their savings, meaning they had £5,000 to get their business off ground.

Ashley-Rae, whose mother is a seamstress and father a businessman, explained: 'I come from a hard-working family and my parents always taught me to work hard if I wanted to get what I wanted.

'While I was a student I juggled two or three jobs - at hairdressers, call centres and clothes shops - I saved as much as I could because I always dreamed of one day being my own boss.

'As we didn't have much money to start with, we got our friends and family involved as much as possible, web designers we knew offered to do our website for free, and friends modelled the clothes.'

They now sell their creations through their online store at competitive high street prices, and last year made £10,000.

Loud Culture's success so far has been down to Ashley-Rae and Abi's dedication to getting themselves noticed - largely by using social network sites such as Facebook and Twitter. They contacted fashion bloggers, celebrity stylists, photographers and models to get their clothing on the fashion radar.

Ashley-Rae said: 'It was all about being persistent and knocking on as many doors as we could. We believed in our brand and although we had nothing but knock-backs to begin with, we've now proved that passion and persistence do pay off.'

Their enterprising efforts were also noticed by Richard Branson, and they are now members of his Virgin Media Pioneers, an initiative he set up to support young entrepreneurs. Ashley-Rae said the initiative offers them support and motivation to believe 'anything is possible'.

The enterprising designer has had further successes as a celebrity fashion guru, as through contacts she has made through Loud Culture she has now become a stylist to pop star Chipmunk.

On top of this role she and Abi are continuing to expand Loud Culture, adding new lines to their collection and continuing to think big.

'We would love one day to see Rihanna or Beyonce in our clothes,' Ashley-Rae said.

Virgin Media Pioneers is an online community which aims to celebrate, support and nurture young ambitious minds who have the skill, ambition and drive to achieve their goals. For more information visit www.virginmediapioneers.com
