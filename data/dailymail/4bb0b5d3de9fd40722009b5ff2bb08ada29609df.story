An orphaned puppy and abandoned kitten who were put together at a rescue centre have become so close - they think they are sisters.

Kitty the cat was brought into Battersea Cats and Dogs Home by a kind-hearted member of the public who found her alone in a garden when she was just one day old.

To keep her company she was put together with Buttons the Jack Russell, who was born at the centre but rejected by her mother as the runt of the litter.

They have since become inseparable - and even cry when Kitty is moved to the cattery to spend some time with other cats.

Battersea Veterinary Nurse Sascha Taylor says the pair eat, sleep and play together.

She said: 'Normally we’d hand rear puppies and kittens separately but we thought we could try putting them together as they are both so young.

'Luckily it’s paid off as they adore being with each other and do everything together - it’s really very sweet.'

Buttons’ mum Poppy was given to the centre in Old Windsor, Berks., because her elderly owners could not cope when they discovered she was pregnant with eight puppies.

But she was the runt of the litter and staff have had to hand-rear her after being rejected by her mother and was at risk of being killed by her seven brothers and sisters.

Kitty and Buttons were put together when they were about two weeks old and treat each other like siblings.

Staff at the animal home are hoping someone has enough room to adopt the loveable pair, who are now both around four weeks old. 

Nurse Sascha added: 'Hand-rearing them is hard work - I have to feed them every two hours, even throughout the night - but it’s totally worth it.

'We’re not sure if they’ll be re-homed together, though it would be great if they did.'
