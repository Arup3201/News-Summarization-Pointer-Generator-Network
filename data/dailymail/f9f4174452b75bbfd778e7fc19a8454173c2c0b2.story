Leaving a beloved pet behind for a holiday, or even for a long day at work, can be heart-wrenching.

But now there is a device that lets owners video chat with their dog or cat from anywhere in the world and even reward them with a treat.

PetChatz claims to be the first-ever videophone of its kind and comes with a colour camera so that pets and owners can see each other.

The PetChatz device lets owners video chat with their dog or cat from anywhere in the world using their computer or smartphone, and even lets them give their pet a treat remotely

Pet owners mount the PetChatz unit at their pet's eye level.

It must also be close to an electrical source.

The device is then connected to a W-iFi network. 

The unit is filled with low calorie treats and 'scentz pads' that have a calming effect.

Owners can log into PetChatz.com on their computer or via the PetChatz smartphone app to talk to their pet.

A special ringtone tells pets their owner is calling so they can be trained to run to the video phone.

Owners can then say hello via their device's colour screen and reward their pets with snacks and scents.

They can record and share videos too.

Both cats and dogs can see in colour, although neither animal's eyesight is as good as a human's.

The device, which is available to pre-order from the Minnesota-based firm, dispenses treats and discharges a soothing scent for animals that are home alone, while also recording the animal’s antics so that owners can share videos of their pet’s reactions.

However, what PetChatz describes as ‘a joyful sensory experience’ comes at a price -  $349 (£213) - and the device is expected to ship in early 2014 to customers only in the U.S. and Canada.

The company said: ‘[The pets] see you, hear you, and feel your love with the tasty treats and soothing scents you provide.

'Your day becomes a little easier; the time away feels a little shorter.’

The device, which costs $349 and contains a colour screen, is due to ship early next year and is mounted at a pet's eye level on a wall. It can dispense treats as well as wafts of calming smells when an owner calls

A special ringtone alerts dogs and cats to a phone call - and possibility of a treat- from their owners - so owners can train their animals to dash to the videophone unit

The PetChatz unit is mounted on a wall at the pet's line of sight and claims to be safe for animals and ‘chew resistant’ so it cannot be easily damaged.

It is filled with treats and contains 'scentz pads’ in a variety of comforting smells to soothe pets.

The device is connected to a Wi-Fi network and owners log on to PetChatz.com on their computer or use a smartphone app to talk to their pet.

A special ringtone tells the pet when its owner is calling, at which point the screen is activated and the video conversation is possible - providing the pet runs to the phone.

Owners can record and share videos of their pet's reactions as well as dispensing treats.

The company said the device is portable so that pet owners can take it to a vets or boarding kennel when on holiday and can talk to their pets there.

Brooke Martin, 15, from Spokane, Washington has also invented a doggy videophone, although hers is not as sleek and compact as the high-end PetChatz offering.

iCPooch, an Internet-enabled device powered by a Raspberry Pi computer, also allows dog owners to video chat with their pets and deliver dog treats from afar, but the device is only at the prototype stage.

iCPooch acts like a computer, using a Raspberry Pi motherboard and Wi-Fi module to connect to the internet.

The computer is attached to a motor which is activated when the owner of the device gives it the ‘drop treat’ command from a remote computing device.

A removable sleeve inside the device houses the treats, and one treat is pushed out by the motor arm each time the motor is activated.

Software for the system is also run in The Cloud, allowing an owner to log in to a personal account.

According to the iCPooch team, an estimated 13 million dogs suffer from separation anxiety, as well as many pet owners.

iCPooch has also come up with an internet-enabled device powered by a Raspberry Pi computer, which allows dog owners to video chat with their pets and deliver treats from afar
