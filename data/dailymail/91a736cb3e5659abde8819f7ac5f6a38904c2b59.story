We still don't know why Lucy learned to walk: The famous 3.2million-year-old hominid fossil was found in Ethiopia, one of the regions analysed

A new study has cast doubt on the long-held theory that our ancestors evolved to walk upright to help them see farther on Africa's vast open grasslands.

Scientists have long believed that early human ancestors began walking on two legs as a response to savannah encroaching on shrinking rainforests in north-east Africa.

With fewer trees to swing from, human ancestors began walking to get around, while walking on two legs enabled them to see predators and prey further afield, the theory claims.

But now a new analysis of the past 12million years' of vegetation change in the cradle of humanity has challenged long-held beliefs about the world in which our ancestors took shape - and, by extension, the impact it had on them.

It found that while the shift to bipedalism seems to have occurred somewhere between 4million and 6million years ago, rainforests had been replaced by grasslands and seasonally dry forests some time before 12million years ago.

Not only that, the tropical grasses and shrubs of the modern African savannah began to dominate the landscape earlier than thought, replacing other kinds of grasses better suited to a wetter environment.

Sarah Feakins, of the University of Southern California, set out to investigate what types of vegetation dominated the landscape surrounding the African Rift Valley.

The area, which includes present-day Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia, is where early hominin fossils trace the history of human evolution.

By combining sediment core studies of the waxy molecules from plant leaves with pollen analysis, Dr Feakins was able to investigate plant molecules dating back to between 12million and 1million years ago.

'It is the combination of evidence both molecular and pollen evidence that allows us to say just how long we've seen Serengeti-type open grasslands,' she said.

Earlier studies on vegetation change 
through this period relied on the analysis of individual sites 
throughout the Rift Valley - offering narrow snapshots.

But
Dr Feakins took a look at the whole picture by using a sediment core 
taken in the Gulf of Aden, where winds funnel and deposit sediment from 
the entire region.

She then
cross-referenced her findings with Naomi Levin, of Johns Hopkins 
University, who has compiled data from ancient soil samples collected 
throughout eastern Africa.

'The
combination of marine and terrestrial data enable us to link the 
environmental record at specific fossil sites to regional ecological and
climate change,' said Dr Levin.

As well as informing scientists about the environment our ancestors took shape in, the study gives insights into the landscape that herbivores like horses, hippos and antelopes grazed, as well as how plants across the landscape reacted to periods of global and regional environmental change.

'The types of grasses appear to be sensitive to global carbon dioxide levels,' said co-author Hannah Liddy, a graduate student at USC.

She is currently working to refine the data pertaining to the Pliocene, to provide an even clearer picture of a period that experienced similar atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to present day.

'There might be lessons in here for the future viability of our grain crops,' added Dr Feakins.
