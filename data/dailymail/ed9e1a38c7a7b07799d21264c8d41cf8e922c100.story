A Texas state trooper who was caught on tape aggressively probing the private parts of two women in a roadside 'body cavity search' has been suspended.

Kelley Helleson has been temporarily let go though is still being paid after Angel Dobbs, 38, and her niece Ashley Dobbs, 24, filed a lawsuit against her, another trooper and the state Department of Public Safety.

The women, from Irving, Texas, claim they were violated when Helleson subjected them to a humiliating and invasive body search that was caught on video.

The 'unconstitutional' search took 
place on July 13 in front of passing cars on State Highway 161, near 
Irving. Ashley and Angel Dobbs claim the trooper used the same blue 
latex gloves while searching both of them.

The women were initially stopped by 
Helleson's colleague David Farrell after he saw one of them throw a 
cigarette butt out the window.

Farrell can be heard in the 
disturbing video questioning the pair about marijuana after supposedly smelling the drug in the women's vehicle, though he failed 
to find any evidence of it in the car.

Despite that, he requested the women be searched because they were 'acting weird.'

The lawsuit states he then tried to 'morph this situation into a DWI investigation,' according to the Dallas Morning News.

Angel Dobbs passed a roadside sobriety test and the women were given warnings for littering.

'This has been an eye-opening experience
for me,' Angel Dobbs said on the video. 'I've never been pulled over, never searched like this. I was 
totally violated over there a few minutes ago... this is so embarrassing
to me.'

Angel Dobbs said in the lawsuit that Helleson irritated an 
anal cyst she suffers from during the search, causing her 'severe and 
continuing pain and discomfort.'

The suit reads: 'Angel Dobbs was overwhelmed with emotion and a feeling of helplessness and reacted stating that Helleson had just violated her in a most horrific manner.'

The two women are also suing the 
director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, Steven McCraw, who 
they claim ignored previous complaints about 'unlawful strip searches, 
cavity searches and the like.'

The Dobbs' lawyer, Scott H. Palmer, said the shocking incident, which was filmed on one of the trooper's dash-mounted cameras, was a roadside 'sexual assault.'

He said the Texas Rangers investigated his clients' complaints but failed to take any action against the troopers.

'You can see what's happening clearly,' he told the Dallas Morning News of the video. 'No one's ever seen the likes of this. We can't let them get away with it.'

The women said the 'molestation' has scarred them for life.

'I've never been so humiliated or so violated or felt so molested in my entire life,' Angel Dobbs told NBCDFW.com.

Her niece added: 'I don't think anybody needs to have to feel, or go through what we went through. It crosses my mind every day. It's humiliating.'
