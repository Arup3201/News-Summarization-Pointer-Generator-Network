Southampton will push their finances to the limit to keep Morgan Schneiderlin this summer.

Arsenal are confident of landing the France midfielder but the Saints are desperate to keep him and will offer him a bumper contract.

Schneiderlin’s £30,000-a-week deal still has two-and-a-half years to run but Southampton are prepared to double his money, making him the club’s top earner.

Southampton are determined to do all they can to keep midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin at St Mary's

Despite having his differences with the Saints last summer the France international has impressed this term

However, Arsenal are increasing their interest in the Frenchman and are prepared to make an offer 

His stock has risen this season after a string of excellent displays for Ronald Koeman’s side.

Schneiderlin, 25, was furious last summer after the club refused to sanction a move to Tottenham during the final weeks of the transfer window.

But his subsequent attitude impressed the club, who want to reward him for his work this season.

However, with the Gunners in the background, Schneiderlin is by no means guaranteed to sign a new deal. In that case the Saints will slap a high price on him in an attempt to put off potential suitors.

Upwards of £25million has been discussed by the Saints hierarchy if they are forced to part with the Frenchman at the end of the season.
