Today we are familiar with our 
continents being scattered across the globe, but 250 million years ago 
they were part of one 'supercontinent'. Here TV geologist Professor Iain
 Stewart tells how the history of the 'supercontinent' is responsible 
for koalas being native only to Australia and llamas to only South 
America, but also, most importantly, how the 'supercontinent' brought 
about the invention of sex...

We geologists are an odd bunch. We travel through lands that don't exist. The gateway to these imagined lands are the rocks underfoot. They are portals to the past. No need for a Tardis or fancy time machine - just a hand lens and a hammer can teleport us back to ancient geological times.

The ancestral Earths we geologists inspect are very different from the familiar geography of the present. Today, our great land masses are scattered across the globe, but repeatedly in our planet's history they have clumped together as vast agglomerations - supercontinents.

Supercontinents come together every 500 million years or so, as armadas of land assemble, weld, founder and disperse. The most recent great continental union occurred 250 million years ago.

Professor Iain Stewart (pictured at Salar de Uyuni - the world's largest salt flat which is in Bolivia) is presenting a TV series on plate tectonics - Rise Of The Continents - which is showing on BBC2 at 9pm on Sundays. Salar de Uyuni holds 50 per cent of the world's lithium which was created by the uplift of the Andes

Geologists give it the name Pangaea, meaning 'all Earth', but it lasted only 100 million years. Its break-up would give us the scattered continents of today.

But more than that, the rise and fall of Pangaea would shape our modern world in the most surprising ways.

For a start, the continental couplings that first gave birth to Pangaea played a critical role in one of the most important evolutionary developments in the story of life - the invention of sexual intercourse.

The evidence is preserved in the walls of one of the planet's geological wonders, the Grand Canyon.

The strata in this gorge span more than a billion years of time, but it is the uppermost rock layers that track the slow death of an ancient ocean as continents coalesced.

The grey muds of shallow seas, then coastal deltas pass up into the distinctive red sands of continental Pangaea.

Among the windblown ripples are footprints which showed that some critters thrived in this new arid wasteland. Not amphibians, which up until this point had been the dominant animals on the planet. But reptiles.

A clue to why the ancestors of 
alligators and crocodiles quickly adapted to the vast Pangaean desert 
lies in the way they have sex. Now, gator sex is pretty much like human 
sex; a tad more brutish and noisy perhaps, but with the same style of 
copulation - internal fertilisation.

For amphibians, fertilisation is a 
messy and haphazard business involving eggs being released in rivers and
 ponds. In reptiles, the sperm is delivered inside the female direct to 
the ova. The embryos grow within protective shells filled with 
life-sustaining amniotic juices. Young reptiles didn't need external 
water to develop.

The hard, impermeable egg was the revolution. It was the great Pangaean desert that kick-started an evolutionary chain reaction that would lead, eventually, to us.

Mammals would evolve to take those 
life-supporting fluids inside their bodies and supply nutrition through a
 placenta, but we're still children of that first amniotic reptile.

Pangaea, or rather its demise, is 
responsible for the survival one of our favourite animals, the koala, in
 an extremely fortunate way.

Two hundred and one million years ago - the date is now quite specific - Pangaea began to break up. Huge splits tore at its centre, and its mosaic of land masses began to unravel and separate.

First, South America eased away from Africa. Later, giant splits set loose the combined bulk of Antarctica and Australia.

Iain Stewart gets up close and personal with a living link to Pangaean times. Alligators are the closest living relative to the reptiles that roamed the land 300 million years ago. These­ reptiles thrived because of an evolutionary advance we have all inherited ­- internal fertilisation

Released from Pangaea, the conjoined twins of Antarctica and Australia were a single southern expanse of lush forest - an ark of biodiversity adrift in the southern ocean.

But their union lasted only until around 90 million years ago, when the first tensions appeared.

The divorce, when it finally happened, saw a rift send Australia north into ever drier environments, while Antarctica was left to languish in polar isolation.

Life aboard these two giant crustal rafts was destined for very different fates. While cold and ice gradually claimed the flourishing forests of Antarctica, fire and drought devastated Australia's rich cargo of life.

But for one unlikely animal, Australia's climatic transformation was salvation.

The koala has a remarkably small brain, which perhaps explains why early on in its evolution it made a dumb decision, striking an exclusive partnership with one type of tree.

Eucalyptus trees have leaves that are almost devoid of nourishment, which is why koalas are basically cuddly chewing machines, constantly consuming eucalyptus leaves to survive.

Iain Stewart in the Himalayas -  mountains that were formed as India collided with the rest of the continent. This was a key step in the formation of Eurasia

The eucalyptus tree turned out to be perfectly suited to the parched, flammable conditions that crept over Australia.

And so rather than being an evolutionary dead-end, the koala thrived. Conservationists may argue just how well koalas are doing today but, compared to the other creatures they shared the southern Pangaean forests with, they are sitting pretty.

Llamas are other cuddly animals who have benefited from continental drift in a surprising way.Since Inca times the llama has been the heart of Andean culture - the animal's wool, meat, even blood all highly prized.

These animals are magnificently adapted to the thin air of the high Andean mountains, with supersized hearts and lungs, and arteries packed with oxygen-enriched blood.

But there is something surprising about this iconic South America animal. Llamas aren't from this continent at all. They evolved in the low plains of North America.

Three million years ago, when the decoupled halves of the Americas finally fused, a great exchange of animal life crossed the narrow land bridge of Panama. Along with the llamas, nearly half of South America's animals emigrated from the north. Geologists call it the Great American Interchange, but it was a rather one-side swapsie.

Few of the South America species - heavily adapted to Amazonian rainforest - fancied the harsher, colder conditions that awaited them north of Mexico.

The rejoining of the Americas was the final major installment in the coming together of the familiar world we know today. Populating that world would begin with a bunch of homo sapiens leaving Africa just 150,000 years ago. As modern humans spread across the globe, civilisation took root in each of the far-flung land masses.

Today, a great global economy binds all the disparate continents together. In essence we've created a new Pangaea - a Pangaea of our own making.
