It was the dream wedding that almost did not take place after 24-year-old football star Fabrice  Muamba 'died' on the pitch seven months ago.

Now this joyful picture of him with his beautiful bride Shauna Magunda on their big day shows just how far the ex-Bolton Wanderers player has come.

The ceremony looked in grave in danger of never happening in March, when Muamba had a heart attack during an FA Cup match at Tottenham ground White Hart Lane.

Doctors said the 24-year-old was 
technically dead for 78 minutes, after he shocked his loved ones and fans around the country by collapsing during the quarter-final.

Muamba had proposed to 27-year-old Miss Magunda just a month before his cardiac arrest, on Valentine's Day.

The distraught young woman became a constant presence at her fiance’s bedside, and by August he had recovered, although his playing days are now behind him.

Their nuptials were attended by Premier League star Robin Van Persie and his wife, who posed with the happy couple for the latest edition of Hello! magazine.

Muamba told the magazine: 'This year has been a difficult one but, to me, marriage is the happy ending.'

The guests also included Reading striker Jason Roberts, ex-England striker Andy Cole and Muamba's Bolton team-mates Stuart Holden and Martin Petrov.

Dr Sam Mohiddin, one of the medics who saved Muamba's life at the London Chest Hospital, also attended.

Dr Mohiddin said: 'Seven months ago this day was 
completely inconceivable.

'I just feel elated for Fabrice and Shauna, and
so honoured to be here to celebrate with them.

'The cardiac arrest had a big impact on 
everyone in football, and we all lived the moment as Fab recovered in 
hospital.

'Everyone is so relieved and happy for him and Shauna.'

The wedding was held at 19th century Peckforton Castle in Cheshire, where Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand and Sunderland player Wes Brown both got married.

A Manchester-based catering firm provided Caribbean-themed food, which included jerk chicken and curried goat.
