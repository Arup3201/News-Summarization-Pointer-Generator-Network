Danny Welbeck is craving the minutes he was rarely awarded at Manchester United and the  Arsenal striker revealed he is itching for a show of faith from new manager Arsene Wenger.

On Monday the 24-year-old was gifted 90 minutes by Roy Hodgson, and Welbeck returned the favour with two goals as England beat Switzerland 2-0 in their opening Euro 2016 qualifier.

Welbeck averaged just 48 minutes in the final Premier League season under Sir Alex Ferguson and 58 the following year under David Moyes, but the forward is confident he can prove more than worthy of his £16million price-tag with more time on the pitch.

Danny Welbeck reckons if the minutes come, then the goals will follow. The striker hopes Arsenal will show faith in his ability, but how has he averaged over the last four seasons?

2010:11: 68 minutes (6 goals, 1 assist)

2011/12: 67 minutes (9 goals, 5 assists)

2012/13: 48 minutes (1 goal, 4 assists)

2013:14: 58 minutes (9 goals, 4 assists)

'It is good for any footballer to get a run of games,' Welbeck said, as reported by The Guardian. 'You become more confident and play much more at ease, so to get a run would be absolutely perfect. 

'The game against Switzerland was my first 90 minutes this season, so it is just the start of things and I'm really looking forward to it.'

In the 2012/13 season, Welbeck averaged just 48 minutes per Premier League match as United won their final title under Sir Alex Ferguson. He did, however, score just one goal throughout with four assists.

Life under David Moyes the year after was worse for those on the red half of Manchester, but ever-so-slightly better for Welbeck, who upped his average to 58 minutes a game. 

Again, the faith was repaid as Welbeck upped his goal tally to nine with four assists.

The forward's switch from Old Trafford to the Emirates defied belief, with Gary Neville among those saying he cannot comprehend how the deadline-day £16m move was agreed.

The former United defender said: 'Of all the prices paid this summer, there are right backs and left-backs galore who have been bought for £14m, £15m, £16m? 

'How have Arsenal got him for £16m? I can’t work it out. It has helped out a competitor because Arsenal are the team they are fighting for fourth possibly.

‘I am struggling to work out the logic, I can’t understand it. It’s odd in two or three ways.' 

Welbeck has been scrutinised for his Premier League record, having scored just 26 in 118 appearances, but time will only tell if the striker can take advantage of more opportunities on the pitch at the Emirates.
