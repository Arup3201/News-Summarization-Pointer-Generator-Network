Tragic: The corpse of Sian Rees, pictured, was found in the van of her partner John Doyle following a road accident and it is alleged she was strapped into the passenger seat

A property developer murdered his lover and put her in the front seat of his van to take her away to dispose of the body – only to be caught when he crashed into a hedge near their home, a court heard yesterday.

John Doyle, 54, is accused of strangling and stabbing Sian Rees the night she came home after surgery for breast cancer.

They had rowed over Miss Rees meeting another man on the internet when he turned up late – and drunk – to collect her from the hospital, it was alleged.

The court heard that the couple’s 15-year relationship had been under strain and, using the pseudonym Sindy Sox, Miss Rees started communicating with a family lawyer online.

This man had invited Miss Rees for a flight in his plane and when Doyle found out a huge row ensued, the jury was told.

When he tried to dispose of the body the next morning, his van hit a traffic island and punctured a tyre.

Desperate not to stop, he eventually lost control and crashed.

Prosecutor Paul Dunkels QC said: ‘It quickly became apparent why the defendant was so keen not to stop and tried to carry on driving on a shredded tyre and metal rim.

‘In the front passenger seat was the body of his partner Sian Rees. She had not been injured in the car crash. Her body was cold and she had been dead for about 12 hours.’

A nurse stopped at the scene of the crash, the court heard, and found that Miss Rees was obviously dead.

Doyle asked ‘Is she OK?’ When told she was dead he replied ‘Oh’, which surprised the nurse because of his ‘lack of emotion’.

Exeter Crown Court was told that on the day of the murder Doyle had dropped his long-term partner off at hospital before drinking in several pubs while she was operated on under general anaesthetic.

After he returned late to pick her up, it was said that despite her post-operative condition, Miss Rees drove the couple home to their converted mill house, but planned to spend the night alone at a hotel.

Before she got there however, the 
court heard, Doyle strangled her and then loaded her body into the 
passenger seat of his Ford Fiesta van. He crashed the next day.

The court heard the couple had also argued about Miss
Rees’s weight and Doyle’s apparent lack of progress in renovating their
remote property, Merton Mill, near Hatherleigh in Devon.

Mr Dunkels said: ‘The defendant was to renovate it while Sian Rees brought in the income.’

But problems arose, Mr Dunkels said, 
because she felt he was not getting on with the renovation and he did 
not like the fact that she had put on a ‘considerable amount of weight’.

Miss Rees, confided to a friend that 
the couple were not ‘making each other happy any more’ and that she was 
‘sick of living on a building site’.

Two days before she was killed, Miss Rees told her secretary that she wanted to ‘start a new life without him’.

At the same time that their relationship hit the rocks, she had been diagnosed with breast cancer.

The court heard that after they 
arrived home from the surgery, a row must have flared in the kitchen 
where, it is alleged, Doyle stabbed her with a four inch knife and may 
have used a leather bra to throttle her before strangling her with ‘his 
bare hands’.

The next morning Doyle set off with the body, knife and bra in his van.

‘It is not clear where he would end 
up or what he was going to do’, Mr Dunkels continued. ‘He knew one 
thing, he had to try and get rid of the body of the woman he had 
murdered.’

A post mortem examination revealed Miss Rees died from compression of the neck and her voice box had been fractured.

Doyle, who denies murder, told police
in a statement that Miss Rees had ‘ranted’ at him on the trip from the 
hospital because he was late and drunk.

At the mill he said his memory was ‘hazy’ but said his lover said she felt ‘old and unattractive’ and was upset.

He claimed she grabbed the kitchen knife and as he took it from her, she was stabbed in the stomach.

The trial continues.
