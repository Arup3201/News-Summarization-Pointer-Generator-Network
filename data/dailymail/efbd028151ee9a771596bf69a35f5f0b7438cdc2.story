Food manufacturer Kraft has decided to remove artificial food dyes from its popular children’s range of mac and cheese.

The packaged food giant claimed the recipe revamp was not in response to a recent petition to remove artificial food colouring which gathered more than 348,000 signatures.

Paprika will be among the natural colourings used instead of artificial dyes in the pasta dish aimed at children.

Au naturel: Packaged food giant Kraft has decided to remove artificial food dye from its popular children's varieties of mac and cheese

The new recipe, with pasta shapes such as SpongeBob Squarepants and Halloween, is due to hit the shelves next year.

The original elbow-shaped macaroni will remain unchanged, the company said.

The petition on Change.org urges Kraft to remove artificial food dyes Yellow 5 and Yellow 6 from their macaroni and cheese varieties in America.

Vani Hari, the petition’s author, said that artificial dyes had been banned in countries such as Norway and Austria and that it causes hyperactivity and learning difficulties in children.

Kraft’s new recipe comes as consumers increasingly opt for more natural, healthier foods. With it there is a growing trend among food manufacturers to adjust their offering to satisfy consumers.

PepsiCo said earlier this year that it would remove controversial brominated vegetable oil (BVO) as an ingredient in its Gatorade Sports drink. The company’s move coincided with another Change.org petition which called for the removal of BVO, a flame retardant chemical.

PepsiCo said it was prompted to change the Gatorade recipe because of customer complaints, not the online petition which recorded more than 206,000 signatures.

Kraft vice president of marketing for meals, Triona Schmelter, said that the company was striving to improve the nutritional value in three macaroni and cheese varieties. The new recipes will add whole grains and reduce the sodium and saturated in an attempt to cater to evolving customer preferences, she said.

Ms Schmelter said: ‘We’ll continue to make improvement where we can.’

Sarah Kavanagh, author of the Gatorade petition, called it a victory, writing on the website: ‘This is so, so awesome,’ after hearing of PepsiCo’s plans to remove BVO. 

She said: ‘As someone who loves to drink their products, I'm so glad they're making strides to put as much consideration into their customers' health.’

Growing trend: Food manufacturers are increasingly adjusting their products to satisfy customers who are opting for healthier, more natural food more and more
