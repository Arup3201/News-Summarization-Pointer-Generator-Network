Yeovil manager Gary Johnson had been strict beforehand in making sure his players didn't pose for any selfies with the visiting Manchester United superstars but they were allowed to grab a souvenir afterwards. 

Captain Joseph Edwards, a United fan, revealed he had exchanged shirts with Wayne Rooney at the end.

It was a miserable afternoon for United misfit Anderson, who was named in Louis van Gaal's squad for the first time since the goalless draw at Burnley on August 30. 

His reward was to spend the entire afternoon sat freezing in the cramped away dug-out. Surely his Old Trafford career is over? 

The matchday programme was a glossy 96-page tome, which was a worthy souvenir of the occasion. 

The back four pages were left blank and labelled 'autographs'. You would have been hard pressed to get any beforehand, with a throng 20-deep waiting for United's team coach to arrive.

This was the third FA Cup clash between Yeovil and Manchester United, and United’s 2-0 victory made it a hat-trick of wins over the Somerset club. 

The aggregate score now stands at 13-0 following a 3-0 victory at Old Trafford in January 1938 and an 8-0 romp in February 1949 at Maine Road (after Old Trafford had suffered bomb damage in the war). Jack Rowley scored five for Matt Busby’s men in the latter game. 

There was a gruesome moment 20 minutes in when United's medical staff got out their stapler to repair damage to Paddy McNair after the defender clashed heads with Yeovil striker Kieffer Moore. 

United club physio Neil Hough and doctor Steve McNally rushed on to administer treatment and the staples were cover by a bandage.

Shortly after Van Gaal tackled this tricky tie at tiny Huish Park, his much-maligned predecessor David Moyes enjoyed one of his greatest victories against a European football superpower. 

The recently appointed Real Sociedad boss saw his team pull off a shock 1-0 Spanish league win at home to Barcelona, thanks to Jordi Alba’s second-minute own goal and a typically solid defensive display that kept Luis Suarez, Neymar and Lionel Messi at bay.
