A family doctor secretly filmed the intimate examination of hundreds of women patients using a camera hidden in his wristwatch.

GP Davinderjit Bains, 45, recorded hours of footage with the £60 spy device as he carried out 'unnecessary and inappropriate' inspections.

The abuse continued for two years until his 19-year-old lodger told police he had filmed her showering and assaulted her.

When Bains was arrested at his surgery
 in Royal Wootton Bassett, Wiltshire, officers discovered 361 video 
clips filmed on the wristwatch – some as long as 45 minutes.

Around 3,000 potential victims were contacted but the exact number is thought to be 'close to 300' – aged between 14 and 51.

Bains appeared at Swindon 
Crown Court where he admitted 39 counts of sexual assault and voyeurism 
and asked for a further 65 offences to be taken into consideration.

He was remanded in custody to be sentenced later.

Detective Inspector Mark Garrett 
described the doctor as a 'sexual predator', adding: 'A large number of 
female patients, including teenage girls, put their trust in this man to
 treat them with the professionalism, care and discretion that we all 
expect of our family doctor.

'But today he stands exposed as someone who has utterly betrayed that trust for his own sexual gratification.'

In a statement the Tinkers Lane Surgery said it was 'appalled' at the crimes Dr Bains had committed.

'This has been a shocking and distressing case for all concerned,' the statement said.

'The partners, GPs and staff of Tinkers Lane Surgery are deeply saddened by the actions of this former colleague and our sympathies remain entirely with the victims and our patients and their families.

'We are appalled that the sort of crimes to which Dr Bains has today pleaded guilty could happen in general practice and we have worked hard with colleagues at NHS Wiltshire and Wiltshire Police to ensure the processes we have in place at the surgery are as robust and safe as possible for our patients.

'We will now seek to rebuild the trust and the confidence of our community and our patients.'

Bains's analogue timepiece – a Tieex 
4GB Waterproof HD Spy Watch DVR – has simple on and off buttons to 
record and can be bought online for less than £60.

Hidden in the number six was a tiny 
high-definition camera, which he used to record examinations between 
2010 and 2012 that police said were 'for his own gratification' and 
'could not be justified as an examination'.

Detectives tracked down the victims by
 matching their faces on the film with patient records. Det Insp Garrett
 added: 'They couldn't believe their GP had betrayed their trust in such
 a way.

'Others were outraged and concerned 
that the footage could have been shared but I can categorically say we 
found no evidence to show that it had been.'

Bains was investigated 
after his student lodger said she was secretly filmed in the shower and 
assaulted after he had given her alcohol along with two pills 'for her 
acne'.

The GP, who is separated from his 
wife, was suspended by the General Medical Council following his arrest 
last year. Tinkers Lane Surgery, where he worked for four years, said 
the case had been 'shocking and distressing'.

A spokesman for NHS Wiltshire said Bains had shown 'reprehensible' abuse of his position.

In a statement, the local primary care
 trust said: 'We are appalled at the crimes to which Dr 
Bains has today pleaded guilty.

'It is clear that he violated the trust and dignity of those who looked to him for professional care and support.

'Such cynical abuse of his position, and the way he concealed these serious offences, is reprehensible.

'We
 want to reassure all patients and the local community that NHS 
Wiltshire has worked closely with the practice and Wiltshire Police 
since becoming aware of these serious and shocking incidents.

'We
 have also conducted our own investigation to see what, if any, lessons 
can be learned from this and we are determined to ensure that any 
safeguards are shared with the wider NHS to further protect all patients
 in future.

'All 
appropriate and relevant steps have been taken to ensure the processes 
followed at the practice are now robust and safe as possible for their 
patients.'
