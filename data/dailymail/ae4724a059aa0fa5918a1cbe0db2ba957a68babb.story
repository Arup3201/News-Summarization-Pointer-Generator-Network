A trucker died in his bedroom after inhaling gas used in auto-erotic asphyxiation, an inquest heard.

Andrew Greenough, 59, was found slumped in his chair by his wife Susan at their home in Reading, Berkshire.

He was wearing a rubber suit and a mask, while cylinders of gas were discovered by his side.

Mrs Greenough - who slept in a separate bedroom - had spoken to her husband of 36 years before leaving for work in October last year, the inquest in Reading heard.

However, she later discovered her partner's body when she returned home at about 3.30pm.

Today, she told the inquest she had been aware of Mr Greenough's misuse of a particular type of gas - a known substance used in auto-erotic asphyxiation - and had told him to stop using it.

'He was aware it did carry risks, but he was prepared to keep doing it,' she said in a statement paraphrased by coroner Peter Bedford.

A post-mortem examination found Mr Greenough had died suddenly, with blood vessel 
haemorrhages around his mouth and nose - both of which are common in asphyxia.

Pathologist
 Dr Fawaz Musa also discovered fluid in his lungs and an enlarged heart, which Mr Bedford said was 'in keeping with hypertension'.

However, Dr Musa said could not be certain whether Mr Greenough had died as a
 result of asphyxia or a sudden cardiac arrest brought on by inhaling 
the gas.

Recording a verdict of death by misadventure, Mr Bedford ruled the trucker had had no intention of taking his own life while performing a 'potentially hazardous' act.

He added that he had not heard any evidence that Mr Greenough was performing the extreme sex act when he died.

'No-one is suggesting for a moment this was an intentional act with the purpose of ending Mr Greenoughâ€™s life,' he said.

'He has done something potentially hazardous without the intention of harming himself, but tragically it has.

'The conclusion I record is simply one of misadventure.'
