A 46-year-old man has died after he was attacked by a 'highly protective' Staffordshire bull terrier, believed to belong to his partner.

The victim was bitten several times, then suffered a back injury, which ruptured his spleen, resulting in his death from internal bleeding.

Police arrested his partner, a 36-year-old woman, in connection with the death at a flat in Westcliff, Essex, but she was later released without charge.

He has not been officially identified but neighbours say he was called Barry and the dog was 'highly protective and edgy'. It has since been destroyed.

Death: A 49-year-old man has died in his flat in Westcliff, Essex after rupturing his spleen following a bite from his pet dog

Billy Morgan, 53, lived in the flat 
above and said he had shared a drink with the couple to 
celebrate his birthday - where he also met the brown Staffordshire bull 
terrier.

He said: 'His 
partner told me it was very protective of her and they were always 
telling it "move," "shut up" and "sit there" while I was there having a 
beer.

'When I got my arm 
out to say 'Can I borrow that?' the dog looked up. If you made a move, 
it would look at you or growl at you, it made me feel really 
uncomfortable.

He said the death had left him greatly upset, describing Barry as a kind, well-natured man.

'The guy was so nice, a very welcoming sort of person, 
great to talk,' he said.

'I still 
can't get over what's happened, it's such depressing news. I didn't 
sleep for the two nights afterwards because I couldn't stop thinking 
about it. It's a nutty world and this has really upset me.'

Another neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'Everyone in the house is so shocked that it happened. We can't believe it. I think it will be on a lot of people's minds whether they want to stay here now.'

Police said the dog, which allegedly bit Barry several times, had been removed from the property following the attack and had since been destroyed.

Officers initially treated the death as suspicious but, following questioning at Southend Police Station, the woman was later released.

A police spokesman said: 'The death of a man found at a flat in Westcliff, on Tuesday, January 7, is not being treated as suspicious.

'Prior to his death the 46-year-old man from Westcliff received injuries to his lower body consistent with dog bites. A Staffordshire bull terrier was removed from the address and has since been put down.

'A post-mortem examination found the initial cause of death to be internal bleeding following a laceration to the spleen.

'Police will now prepare a file for the coroner.

'There appears to have been an incident whereby then man was bitten by the dog. It is likely that during this incident the man sustained an injury to his back and this then caused damage to his spleen. It is not possible to say how that back injury was caused. The injuries to the spleen were not due to the bites by the dog.'
