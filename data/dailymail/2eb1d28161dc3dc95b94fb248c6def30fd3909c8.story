What sort of property can a buyer get in the current market for £100,000?

If you're looking in County Durham, the answer could well be up to twelve of the country's cheapest terrace houses.

But for buyers in Belgravia, the sum will merely get you the keys for a garage.

Costly: The small lock-up in Little Chester Street, Belgravia, will set buyers back £100,000

The shabby-looking 153sq foot lock-up is just a stone's throw away from Buckingham Palace.

And with an asking price of £100,000, its value dwarfs that of the UK’s cheapest home - a terraced property that sold for just £8,250 in County Durham last March.

Exclusive: Although the garage looks fairly inconspicuous, property in Belgravia exchanges hands for huge amounts of money

The garage, which is situated close 
to Little Chester Street in fashionable Belgravia, south-west London, is
part of a row of uninspiring parking spaces.

But
despite its drab white-panelled revolving door and dreary grey 
brickwork inside, the space is set to net its owner a small fortune.

Hugo Headlam, from John D. Wood and Co estate agents, who are selling the garage, said: 'It can only really be used as a garage or storage space.

'There’s just enough room to fit in one decent sized sports car but that is about it.

'Purely its location alone, in one of the most desirable neighbourhoods in the world, makes it a valuable asset.

'And when compared to similar sales in and around the area, £100,000 is fairly standard.'

At current rates, the garage is just £13,000 shy of the average house price in Hartlepool.

Yet despite the seemingly huge asking price, the garage is considerably cheaper than the world's most expensive lock-up which went on the market in May.

With an asking price of £525,000, the double garage in Knightsbridge was situated on a back street close to Harrods.

Whilst that lock-up came complete with a freehold, however, the £100,000 garage in Belgravia has a lease of just 44 years.

Mr Headlam said that the asking price represented good value for money: 'Belgravia is one of the most expensive areas of real estate in the world.

'The garage is in prime central London near Belgrave square, which is a very different market to the rest of the country.'
