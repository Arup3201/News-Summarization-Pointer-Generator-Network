Pupils of stabbed teacher Ann Maguire have held a one minute silence and released hundreds of balloons as a heartfelt tribute at a football match held in her honour.

Hundreds of Mrs Maguire's students past and present gathered at the memorial game held a week after her tragic death.

Linking arms and proudly wearing shirts bearing the popular teacher's name, the pupils at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds, West Yorkshire paid tribute to Mrs Maguire, who was stabbed to death as she taught a Spanish class.

Mrs Maguire, described by many of her students as 'inspirational', was killed on 
her day off after going to school to help pupils prepare for their 
exams.

She was just months from retiring after 40 years at Corpus 
Christi.

After the poignant, and perfectly observed, minute's silence to remember the much-loved Spanish teacher, pupils took to the school's football pitches to play in the memorial match.
