Since Luisana Lopilato was announced as the face (and incredible body) of Ultimo lingerie sales have rocketed by 37 per cent.

And now, the stunning wife to singer Michael Bublé and a successful actress in 
her home country of Argentina, has returned to showcase the lingerie brand's glamorous new swimwear line for one final time before she gives birth.

The
 campaign features 25-year-old Luisana modelling a variety of new 
swimwear designs in the early stages of pregnancy, although there is no sign of a bump.

One such design is the Miami bikini, which promises to boost cleavage by 2 cup sizes owing to gel technology.

The blonde beauty also showcases the Sahara swimsuit – a stylish cut-out design, featuring an adjustable fit.

The new campaign was shot earlier this year in New York by renowned fashion photographer Dan Kennedy who has previously photographed the likes of Angelina Jolie and Lindsay Lohan. 

Michelle Mone, founder of Ultimo, said: 'Our gorgeous new swimwear collection is designed for women who want the perfect cleavage for the beach. 

'Each design is figure enhancing and flattering – and a glamorous style statement.'

She added: 'Think of the new collection as the perfect attire for your next holiday to Miami or Marbella!'

The new collection includes four designs available in red, cobalt blue, nautical stripes and black, and in sizes 32A-38D, 8-16.

When Michelle Mone was awarded an OBE
 in 2010 for her services to business, she gave thanks to Luisana and 
the other Ultimo models (Tamara Ecclestone and Amy Childs also modelled 
for the brand in 2011).

And when she promised that the upcoming years would be even bigger, she was not wrong.

At the time, she said: 'This year we 
have unveiled some amazing images designed to best showcase our 
collections and it has been fantastic to be involved with some 
incredible women.

'Signing
 Michael Bublé’s wife Luisana is one of our biggest international stars 
and the response we have had has been phenomenal.'

Bublé recently told MailOnline that he is looking forward to becoming a father with his model wife and divulged that they are expecting a boy.

The new collection is available from ASOS.com and ultimo.co.uk.
