Busted: Ana Gloria Garcia-Gutierrez, 53, was arrested by Pinellas County Sheriff's deputies early Saturday morning for riding a manatee in September

A Florida woman who had made headlines around the world after being photographed riding a manatee was arrested Saturday and charged with a misdemeanor under the state's protection act.

Ana Gloria Garcia Gutierrez, 53, was taken into custody at the Sears store at Tyrone Square Mall in St. Petersburg where she works.

Her arrest comes more than a month after she came forward to admit that she was the woman seen in pictures on the back of a manatee, or sea cow, in Fort DeSoto Park in Pinellas September 30, NBC reported.

The photos were posted online October 2 and went viral. Sheriff Bob Gualtieri held a press conference a few days later asking for the public's help in identifying the woman riding the endangered animal.

'Go ride a Jet Ski,' the sheriff said at the time. 'Don't use animals.'

Gutierrez called deputies later that day and allegedly admitted touching the sea mammal. She told them she was new to the area and didn't know her actions were against the law. The manatee was not hurt.

Florida's Manatee Sanctuary Acts reads: 'It is unlawful for any person at any time, by any means, or in any manner intentionally or negligently to annoy, molest, harass, or disturb or attempt to molest, harass, or disturb any manatee.'

The case was forwarded to the State Attorney's Office for prosecution.

if convicted of the second-degree misdemeanor, Gutierrez faces up to 60 days in jail and a $500 fine. She was released on $1,500 bail, according to Tampa Bay Times.

Molestation: Police are on the hunt for the woman, pictured, who was snapped riding a manatee on Sunday

On September 30, Pinellas County Sheriff's deputies rushed to the beach at about 1pm after receiving reports of a woman 'riding' the animal. But when they arrived, the culprit had disappeared.

However, a quick-thinking onlooker 
managed to take photographs of the woman's joy ride.

After the photos of a woman dressed in a black and white bikini top, red boardshorts and a white cap straddling a manatee were released by the Pinellas County Sheriff's Department, the 53-year-old Gutierrez turned herself in.

She reportedly claimed that she was new in town and did not know she had done anything wrong.

Florida's Manatee Sanctuary Act forbids 'activities may not, either intentionally or negligently, molest, harass, collide with, injure or harm manatees.'

Illegal: Under Florida law, it is illegal to 'annoy, molest, harass, or disturb or attempt to molest, harass, or disturb any manatee'

Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said the manatee-molestation was 'outrageous' and warned people to leave the animals alone.

'This is manatee mating season and there are a lot of manatees around but people need to just leave them alone and not molest them and certainly not try to ride them,' he said during a news conference.

'It's pretty outrageous when somebody does that.'

But the sheriff's office told the Orlando Sun-Sentinel that she was not arrested because the crime did not take place in a deputyâ€™s presence.

Deputies told the paper that charges would be referred to the Florida State Attorney's Office.

'It's clear from the photographs that's what she was doing,' Gualtieri added.

'We are asking for the public's help in identifying this woman so that the deputies can place the appropriate criminal charges against her.'

The unlucky sea cow wasn't believed to have been hurt in the incident.
