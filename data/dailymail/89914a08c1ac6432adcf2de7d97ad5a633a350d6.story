With five children already and another on the way, Marie, a 30-year-old full time mother from the Democratic Republic of Congo's Kasai Oriental province, was looking forward to meeting her new baby.

Like other Congolese mothers, she had booked into the local hospital for the birth and had saved up to pay for the services of a midwife.

But things didn't go to plan and as a result, Marie has spent months imprisoned in hospital, her newborn baby with her - all because she didn't have the £35 needed to pay for the emergency caesarian she was forced to have.

Prisoner: Marie was told she couldn't leave hospital after giving birth until she paid for her caesarean

Speaking to MailOnline, she explained: 'I came into the hospital on 2nd November to give birth to my sixth child, but there were complications.

'My child is out of danger now - he has no health problems. But I am still in the hospital because I don't have the money to pay for the operation I had to have because of the birth complications.

'I have to pay to leave the maternity ward and I don't have the money. I had saved up the money to pay for a normal birth but the complications meant that the birth cost more – now I owe 53,000 Congolese francs (£35) and I don't have the money to pay that.

'When it came time to go home, the nurses asked me for the money and I had to tell them that I didn't have it. That's why I'm still here – the nurses didn't want to let me leave.'

Shockingly, Marie's story is far from unique as one of her doctors, Josephine, confessed.

'There are five women in this hospital at this point who are in the same situation, although one of these lost her child during the birth,' she explains, adding: 'I don't think it costs the hospital any more to keep them here.'

Asked about Marie, Josephine insisted that she and fellow doctors are right to hold her prisoner in hospital and said that if they had let Marie have the caesarian for nothing, they would be forced to do the same for other patients.

'This woman's wound has already healed so she has no need to stay in hospital any longer,' she explained. 'She is only here because she doesn't have the money needed to allow her to leave.

'We have guards on the door to ensure patients who aren't supposed to leave don't do so without permission.

'There's only one door out and there are two sentries guarding it. They are very vigilant: the security is very tight, people can't escape.

'It is a somewhat difficult situation, because if we take responsibility for this woman then all the others will want us to do the same for them, and if we don't it will be showing a kind of favouritism – as if we preferred to help one woman rather than others.'

The DRC is one of the toughest places for children to be born according to women and children's charity, Save The Children.

According to their figures, the child mortality rate in the African country is as high as 146 per 1,000 live births while the newborn mortality rate is 44 per 1,000. By contrast, just five in every 1,000 British children dies before the age of five.

And while British mothers can give birth for nothing, the DRC has no public healthcare system and as a result, less than 25 per cent of the population has access to a functional health service that they can afford to use.

Commenting on Marie's story Justin Forsyth, Save the Children CEO said
 every mother should have the right to free care in labour and has 
called on David Cameron and other world leaders to take action.

He said: 'No
 mother should be kept hostage because she is unable to pay for the 
emergency care that saved her life and that of her newborn child.

'It's
 a scandal and every mother – no matter where she lives in the world -  
should have access to a midwife and free care when she needs it the 
most.  

'Marie's
 story shows just why it is important for countries to step up and put 
the health of their mothers and newborn babies first.'

As for Marie herself, being released from hospital remains a distant dream. Alone after her husband returned home to care for their other children and raise the money needed to free her, Marie says she has no idea when she will finally be released.

'I don't have family who can help me and there is no other way for me to leave the hospital other than paying what I owe,' she admits.

'It's just the operation I need to pay for - they aren't trying to charge me for the extra days I've had to stay.

'I am allowed to have visitors but I'm not allowed out of the hospital. I don't know how long I'll be here: I just have to wait until my husband finds the money.'
