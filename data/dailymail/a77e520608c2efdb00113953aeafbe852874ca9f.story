David takes on Goliath: Richard Gollin, who runs the six-bed roomed Baille na Cille guesthouse, claims that negative criticism posted about his business are false

For millions of holidaymakers, it is an online bible that helps them to pick the best hotels – and avoid the worst.

But one Hebridean guest house owner claims some of the candid hotel and restaurant reviews posted by users around the world on Trip-Advisor have harmed his business.

Now former college lecturer Richard Gollin is to sue the world's largest travel website in a landmark case.

He claims false and negative postings on the website have driven away potential customers.

Mr Gollin, who runs the six-bedroomed  beachside Baille na Cille guest house at an idyllic spot in Uig on the west coast of Lewis, claims some of the negative criticism about his business should have been removed by TripAdvisor.

He is taking on the might of the international travel guide, which is valued on the US stock exchange at more than £2billion, over suspected malicious postings he says hit his income.

In a David and Goliath battle, Mr Gollin, 64, has begun a small claims action at Stornoway Sheriff Court.

He believes the website is rife with inaccurate or false guest reviews.

Postings include one from a guest who criticised the food and claimed visitors were under-fed. Another review included criticism of extra charges for a phone bill.

Mr Gollin said: 'We are the most smallest, westerly remote guest house in Britain and we are taking on one of the largest travel guide companies.

'False criticisms': Baille na Cille has been 'hurt' by postings that Mr Gollin says should have been removed from the travel guide

'I believe TripAdvisor is in dereliction
of duty in failing to have proper supervision of what goes on their 
website. All across the country people should stand up to TripAdvisor.'

Mr Gollin claims he has lost bookings as a result of negative and false postings and is seeking compensation from the US-based firm.

On TripAdvisor, Mr Gollin's B&B has a mark of four stars out of five, with 41 out of 50 people rating it as 'very good' or 'excellent'.

But some people have made complaints:

One user wrote: 'It is in a stunning location however the room was freezing cold and there was no hot water to have a wash.'

Another wrote: 'Found the owner patronising and pompous.'

Another user said: 'The dining room decor was distateful (sic) to us - filled with war memorabilia. The room was clean, but horribly ordinary.'

The amount he is seeking has not been 
disclosed, though £3,000 is the maximum limit available under the small 
claims procedure. 

Londoners Mr Gollin and his wife Joanna, 52, the guest house chef, came to Lewis on honeymoon in the late 1970s and later relocated permanently.

Mr Gollin worked as a business studies lecturer at Lews Castle College in Stornoway before leaving to concentrate on the guest house.  

He said: 'Anyone can go on the TripAdvisor site and within two minutes could post a fake review about the Ritz Hotel in London, for example, without even being there – they could just make it up.'

Mr Gollin said he asked TripAdvisor to remove false postings but claims the company ignored him.

The negative comments posted on the reviews website referred to the meals, the age of the building, the host himself and the beds.

TripAdvisor insists in court submissions it is not subject to the law in Scotland and its legal team, from its Massachusetts headquarters, has instructed Stornoway lawyer Angus Macdonald.

He is asking Sheriff David Sutherland to throw the case out of court, claiming it is outwith Scottish jurisdiction.

Mr Gollin was originally representing himself but has now hired lawyer Duncan Burd.

Court papers were lodged yesterday but the case has been continued to a later date.

TripAdvisor, owned by the Expedia travel website firm, is valued at £2.3billion.

Earlier this year its founder, Stephen Kaufer, defended the site, saying: 'Hotels would ring us saying, "We've been given a terrible review, take it down". But that's against everything we are meant to do, which is to create transparency.'

Asked about Mr Gollin's case last night, a TripAdvisor spokesman said: 'We do not comment on threatened or pending litigation.'
