Axe attack: Peter John Tames received a suspended sentence after he attacked his neighbour with an axe after becoming incensed by his dog

A man who attacked his 'terrified' neighbour with an axe because of his barking dog has avoided jail.

Peter John Tames, 47, was incensed after being disturbed by Andrew Palmer's dog's continuous barking, so recorded the noise and played it back through the wall in retaliation.

When Mr Palmer went round to apologise, Tames attacked him – first with a punch and then with an axe.

Agoraphobic Tames, from Macclesfield, admitted criminal damage and assault at Macclesfield Magistrates' Court on October 10.

He received a five-month jail sentence suspended for 12 months.

The court heard that the incident happened on September 10 when Mr Palmer came home from work at 4.45pm after picking up his son.

Mr Palmer said he began to hear a dog barking next door a short time later, and eventually recognised the sound to be a recording of his own dog.

He says he decided to go next door to apologise for the noise, but claims to have found the defendant 'rambling' and 'sounding drunk'.

Bev Dobson, prosecuting, said 'He had an aggressive posture. Mr Palmer thought he was about to be head-butted and in self-defence pushed the defendant away. Tames then swung a punch and hit the victim’s upper ear. At that stage Mr Palmer’s wife came home. He pushed the defendant back so he could get his wife inside the house.'

She added added: 'Five minutes later there was a knock on Mr Palmer’s door. As he opened door he saw the defendant had a wooden-handled axe above his head. He swung it in the direction of Mr Palmer from a couple of feet away. It was clearly aimed at him. He managed to close the door in time but the axe came into the house and hit the meter box.'

Mrs Dobson went on to describe the victim as 'absolutely terrified'.

The court heard police found a large axe at Tames’s address and that the defendant was staring and growling at the officers, apparently shouting 'I love pain. Give me some more'.

'He told police his lack of sleep had made him irritable. The dog was constantly barking. He said he didn’t aim the axe at the victim but just wanted to scare him.'

Anthony Derbyshire, defending, said: 'He has suffered two recent bereavements in the last three years, his partner and his father.

'It has affected his mental health and he has become agoraphobic and alcohol-dependent. He is ashamed and sorry for his actions, which are very out of character.'

Tames was also given a 12-month community order with alcohol treatment and supervision. He was ordered to pay £700 court costs and £1,500 compensation.
