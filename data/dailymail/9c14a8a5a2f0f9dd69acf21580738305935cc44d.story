A Czech killer was allowed to slip into Britain to carry out a series of sex attacks including a knifepoint rape.

Until they caught Kajus Scuka, police did not even realise the 48-year-old was in the country.

By then he had attacked three women and ambushed and raped a fourth while she was walking her dog.

Jailed: Kajus Scuka, 48, who had served 11-and-a-half years of a 13 year sentence in his homeland

Sentencing Scuka to a minimum of 12 years yesterday, Judge Peter Kelson highlighted security flaws that had allowed a dangerous criminal to travel freely across the European Union.

Only a week ago, Lady Justice Hallett questioned whether serious offenders were allowed to simply ‘walk into the country’ after Victor Akulic, a 44-year-old child rapist from Lithuania, was convicted of raping a woman in Kent.

Judge Kelson said Scuka, who served 11 years for murdering his wife, also had convictions in his homeland for gross indecency, indecent assault and a brutal axe attack on a woman.

Judge Peter Kelson told the defendant: 'It seems to me that even with your convictions for murder and assaults you were free to enjoy the same freedom of movement as any other European citizen'

‘It seems to me the case that even with your convictions for murder and assaults you were free to enjoy the same freedom of movement as any other European citizen,’ he added.

Scuka arrived unchecked in the UK in 2009 after the biggest single EU expansion in its history allowed Eastern Europeans from eight former Soviet Bloc countries unfettered access to the UK labour market.

Under the legislation, individuals can be denied entry and placed on a ‘watch list’ of criminals and terror suspects, but only if their country of origin tells UK border authorities they are dangerous.

Despite his previous convictions Scuka, who stabbed his wife to death when she discovered he was cheating on her, appeared on no such list.

His case will almost certainly heap further pressure on the Home Office to tighten checks on EU arrivals.

Sheffield Crown Court was told that just months after arriving here Scuka committed the first of his sex attacks.

In March 2010, he indecently assaulted a woman as she pushed her two-and-a-half-year-old granddaughter in a pram in Sheffield Lane Top.

The second attack came a month later 
when Scuka asked a 23-year-old for directions before throwing her to the
 ground and saying in broken English: ‘I give you 30 quid.’

Two hours later Scuka raped his third 
victim on playing fields. Scuka pushed her to the ground and ripped off 
her clothes before raping her, said prosecutor Mike Smith.

The woman told the court how a man 
speaking broken English asked her for directions, knocked her into a 
ditch and threatened her with a knife.

Her ordeal ended only when her dog 
jumped on her chest and Scuka fled. The final attack came last May when 
Scuka targeted a student in her 20s as she walked through a park.

He was arrested a few minutes later at his home just half a mile away.

His DNA was found on the rape victim 
while fibres from a hooded top he wore for the final attack were found 
on his victim’s coat. Until then officers had failed to find a match for
 it on their UK database and were in the process of searching 
international records – a process that would have taken months.

Scuka, who spoke through an interpreter for the court proceedings, was convicted by a jury of rape and three offences of sexual assault after a trial earlier this month.

Detective Sergeant Ian Harding, of South Yorkshire Police, said: ‘It is a concern that people of this nature move freely about the EU without any restriction.

‘This man has been living in Sheffield since 2009 and we were not even aware of his presence.’

A UK Border Agency spokesman said: ‘We check all passengers entering the UK against watch lists but we rely on overseas police to inform us of conviction information, which did not happen in this case.

‘Had border staff been aware of these convictions we could have refused him entry and we will now seek to deport him following his custodial sentence.’

Many foreign nationals do not undergo rigorous background checks even after they have been arrested. Each year, around 30,000 pass through the criminal justice system without police exploring the full extent of their criminal pasts.

By comparison, criminals from outside the EU who want to come to Britain must obtain a visa before entering – and are required to declare any previous convictions.

Last year, Intars Pless, 34, a convicted axe killer from Latvia, was jailed for ten years for mowing down and killing a moped rider in Boston, Lincolnshire.
