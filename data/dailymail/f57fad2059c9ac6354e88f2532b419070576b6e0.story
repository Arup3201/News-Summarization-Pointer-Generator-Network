We've had the spork, or the spoon-and-fork - and now there's another piece of cutlery that could save on the washing up.

The device, dubbed the ‘Knork’, combines the four prongs of a fork with the sharp edge of a knife.

Made of stainless steel, it has been designed with very slight curved edges, so the bladed section will not easily cut someone reaching into the cutlery drawer, or even worse, cut their tongue while they are eating.

While the Knork is similar in design to a pastry fork, which also has a knife-like edge, it is double-edged and much sharper, which its makers claim allow it to easily tackle a potato or cut up a pizza

While the Knork is similar in design to a pastry fork, which also has a knife-like edge, it is double-edged and much sharper, which its makers claim means it can easily tackle a potato, cut up a pizza or slice steak.

Traditionalists might claim the device facilitates lazy eating and the mindless 'shovelling' of dinners.

However, it could prove incredibly useful to some disabled people who might be restricted to eating with one hand only.

Simon Buckingham, 53, marketing director at Buckingham Healthcare in Poole, Dorset, said: 'Each outer stem of the Knork, known as the tines, is specially bevelled during the manufacturing process.

'In conjunction with the curvature of the tines this makes the Knork an effective cutting tool, equivalent to a knife, while providing its main function as a fork.

'The clever bit is that even though the tines will effectively slice through food it is bevelled in such a way that you are not able to easily cut your tongue or mouth.

'Incorporated in the stem is a finger platform that allows the user to easily pressurise the Knork to cut through the food of choice.'

The Knork costs £19.50 for a pack of five or £53.62 pounds for a pack of 20.
