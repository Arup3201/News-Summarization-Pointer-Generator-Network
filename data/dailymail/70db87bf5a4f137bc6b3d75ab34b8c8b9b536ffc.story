It might be time to book in for that bikini wax if the latest summer trend is anything to go by.

Yes, that's right, the infamous high-cut Baywatch-style bathing suit - made famous by Pamela Anderson in the 90s - is back with a vengeance this season.

In the last month alone, one e-tailer has seen sales of the poolside apparel soar by 329 per cent - and there's a certain pop star to blame.

Oh, Miley! Miss Cyrus, who has a penchant for crotch-baring garments, is behind the new trend

Leading 
the charge for the ‘90s revival is wild child Miley Cyrus, who pioneered the revival of the silhouette when undergoing her radical transformation 
from Hannah Montana to pop rebel.

The creations Miley wore on her Bangerz Tour by Marc Jacobs, Roberto Cavalli and The Blonds, have clearly reignited a thirst for lycra in a variety of vibrant shades and prints.

Australian rapper Iggy Azalea has also been championing the new trend, often opting for glamorous swimsuits by American designers Marco Marco and Betsey Johnson.

Cameron Diaz is at it too, showcasing a sleek and sophisticated interpretation of the trend, appearing on the cover of this month’s Esquire magazine. Cameron exuded elegance in a jaw-dropping LBS (Little Black Swimsuit), perfectly accessorised with a pair of gold heels.

Jennifer Lopez and Beyoncé are also fans of the one-piece and have recently made on-stage appearances in garments that caress every curve in an array of colours and cuts.

The statement item is all part of the new 'pelvage' trend that's seen celebrities step out in dresses with hip-high slits that reveal the hip bones and pelvis area, marking the latest skin-baring red carpet trend - a portmanteau of pelvis and cleavage.

Kendall Jenner, 18, caused a stir when 
she appeared at the MuchMusic Video Awards in Toronto wearing a dress 
that was slashed to her waist in June.

'Why do one slit when you can do TWO!?' she asked on Instagram alongside three shots of herself in the white embellished long-sleeved Fausto Puglisi gown.

Underwear is optional 
when showing pelvage, as Paris Hilton demonstrated at her 33rd birthday 
party in February. Ms Hilton wore a fuchsia Alon Livne cutout gown that 
left little to the imagination.

It's a sell out! In the last month alone, eBay has seen sales of the poolside apparel soar by 329 per cent

A spokesperson for eBay, who spotted the surge in sales, said: “The fashpack have spoken and this summer the bathing suit returns in an array of flattering cuts and colours.'

Speaking about the trend, Lisa Haynes, Fashion and Beauty Editor of the Press Association, said: 'Gone are the days when swimsuits were deemed the more modest option over bikinis. This is a case of "how high can you go?".

'With the likes of Miley wearing uber high-cut bodies for performing, they've become more of a statement piece than swimwear you might go for a dip in.

'If you are taking the plunge, the cut will instantly elongate your legs. Apply the legs or cleavage rule and keep the swimsuit neckline high so you're limiting the amount of flesh on show.

'Only attempt this risqué silhouette if you've got the body confidence to pull it off - and a Brazilian waxer on speed dial.'
