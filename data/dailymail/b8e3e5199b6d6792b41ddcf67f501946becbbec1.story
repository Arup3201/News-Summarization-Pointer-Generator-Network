Betrayal: Amie Miller died after basic checks were not made

Hospitals where hundreds of patients were dying needlessly received elite status under a flagship Labour policy, it emerged yesterday.

Six failing NHS trusts were rewarded even though their death rates had been persistently high for years.

The trusts, which include Basildon and Thurrock, Burton, Medway, Northern Lincolnshire and Goole, Sherwood Forest, and Tameside, were placed in special measures this summer after a major investigation exposed appalling levels of care.

Yesterday the Health Secretary announced plans to effectively strip them of the coveted ‘foundation trust’ status, endowed by Labour, which enables bosses to set their own pay and build wards and departments without prior Whitehall approval.

Jeremy Hunt also accused Labour of making ‘big mistakes’ over the policy and ‘waving through’ hospitals as elite even though patients were dying as a result of poor care.

He promised to overhaul the scheme by ensuring only hospitals with care rated as good or outstanding would qualify.

Foundation trusts were introduced by former Labour health secretary Alan  Milburn in 2002 to give the best-performing hospitals more independence.

In all, 88 of the 147 hospital trusts in  England have gained the status after applying to the Care Quality Commission and the NHS Trust Development Authority watchdogs, which check their finances and standard of care.

But yesterday Mr Hunt warned that the independence earned from being a foundation trust ‘had done more harm than good’ for some.

He also said officials granting the status had been too focused on finances rather than care. This led to hospital managers cutting frontline staff and jeopardising patient safety just to ensure they balanced the books before applying.

This is how the Mail highlighted the case of Amie Miller, a 15-year-old from Thurrock, who died after doctors failed to carry out basic checks

Figures analysed by Professor Sir Brian Jarman, an expert on hospital performance at Imperial College London, show that the death rates for five of the six trusts were higher than expected when they were granted foundation trust status.

Only Medway NHS trust in Kent recorded rates that were lower than expected, but there are doubts over the accuracy of its figures.

The worst was Basildon and Thurrock, in Essex, where death rates were 20 per cent higher than they should have been when the trust earned foundation status.

Yesterday, the Mail highlighted the case of Amie Miller, a 15-year-old from Thurrock who died of a brain injury at Basildon Hospital.

Doctors failed to carry out basic tests that could have saved her life when she was admitted with migraine symptoms in 2008.

She was also given the wrong medication, which may have worsened her condition.

Doctors did not give her an MRI scan, despite one being recommended, and the results of a CT scan were misinterpreted.

In a damning verdict, an inquest jury this week said staff had missed a string of opportunities to save Miss Miller’s life.

Hospital care came under scrutiny after a damning report into the Mid Staffordshire scandal, where hundreds died from neglect.

Since then another 11 trusts – including the six foundation trusts – have been singled out for their high death rates and poor levels of care.

And later this month another major inquiry will look into the needless deaths of mothers and babies at University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay Trust, in Cumbria.

Mr Hunt said: ‘Through the horrors of Mid-Staffs and Morecambe Bay, it’s become clear that Labour made big mistakes in the way they implemented their flagship foundation trust initiative. We back foundation trusts and think they are key to raising NHS standards, but it’s unacceptable that hospitals with persistently high death rates were given this elite status.’

He said poor scrutiny by the Care Quality Commission watchdog was partly to blame, adding: ‘Management failed but still kept their independence because the quality watchdog was not fit for purpose.’

He announced plans for managers from top performing trusts to be sent in to those in special measures to help turn them around.

But Labour health spokesman Andrew Gwynne said: ‘Reports revealed that these hospitals have deteriorated and lost staff under David Cameron. Ministers shouldn’t try to pass the buck.’
