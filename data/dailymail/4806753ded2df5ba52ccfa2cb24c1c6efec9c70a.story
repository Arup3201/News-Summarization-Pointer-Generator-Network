If you have ever wondered how it might feel to be famous actor or rock star with a team of people to satisfy your every whim, then all you need is a phone.

A service called Magic aims to provide users with anything they want - providing it’s legal - and all they have to do is send a text message.

Once an operator receives the message, they ask follow-up questions, say how much an item will cost and arrange its delivery as quickly as possible.

Users can sign up to Magic’s service, which is currently only available in the US, by texting 408-217-1721.

The service is the brainchild of a company called Plus Labs in Mountain View, California.

‘We have trained operators standing by 24/7 to answer every one of your requests,’ its website says.

‘Send us a text message, and we'll get you what you want.’

Trained operators answer the text message requests (examples are shown) and work out how to fulfill the request in the fastest and best way possible. For example, plane or rail tickets can be bought online and then emailed to the individual, while a service such as Instacart may be used to do the weekly shop

Users based in the US text 408-217-1721 with their request.

Trained operators work out how to fulfil it and send a text back, asking more questions and then stating how much the service will cost, including a tip.

The Californian company behind the service says it can be used for 'anything you want. As long as it's not illegal'.

The first time someone uses it, they are send an encrypted message asking for their bank details and address etc.

These details are held by another service called Stripe, so this step can be skipped after the first use.

Once a message is sent, it is left to the operator to work out how to fulfill the request in the fastest way possible.

For example, plane or rail tickets can be bought online and then emailed to the individual, while a service such as Instacart may be used to do the weekly shop.

‘We'll order what you need from the appropriate service (e.g. DoorDash, Instacart, Postmates, etc), and deal with them so you just automatically get what you want, like magic...’ it added.

The service makes money by charging a fee, or ‘tip’ for its fixing service, which means that users pay two premiums for a supermarket shop, for example.

But texting the number in the first place is free and Magic always tells the user the cost of using it to buy a product or service before it’s ordered. 

‘There are no hidden fees, and tip is included,’ the website added.

The first time an individual uses the service they are asked for their card details and address via a 128-bit encrypted link sent by text message.

These details are then stored securely to make life easier afterwards.

The processing of payments is handled by a service called Stripe, which means Magic doesn’t hold bank details itself. Bitcoin is also accepted as payment.

The Magic service may seem extravagant to some, but last year, a phone from luxury manufacturer Vertu launched for £6,750 ($11,380) which comes with a 24-hour concierge service.

Made of titanium, the Signature Touch handset has a screen protected by sapphire crystal and leather casing.

Owners get a 24-hour concierge available via voice, email and live chat, while the built-in Vertu Life app offers exclusive access to sporting events and private members’ clubs worldwide.

Each Signature Touch phone is custom made, by hand, using grade 5 titanium and finished off with calfskin in a range of colours, including Claret Calf, Seaspray Lizard, and Jet Alligator.

Its 4.7-inch, 1080p HD screen is protected by sapphire crystal and it features Digital Dolby Surround sound through its Bang and Olufsen speakers.

On the rear of the device is a 13MP Hassleblad-certified camera - the firm that provided the cameras for the moon landings.

The phone runs on Android KitKat 4.4 and comes with Vertu Life, Certainty and Concierge.

According to the firm, the Life app is a ‘passport to the world’s most exclusive events.’

Vertu’s 24-hour Concierge is a personal assistant that helps from ‘tracking down a hard-to-find item to accessing tickets for high-profile events.’

While Vertu Certainty protects and encrypts calls and date, to make the handset secure and private.
