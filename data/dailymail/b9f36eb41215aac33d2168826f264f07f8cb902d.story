A 28-stone binge-eater who spent more than £20,000 on takeaways when she couldn't afford to pay her mortgage has lost more than 15 stone after her home was repossessed.

Amanda Ford, from Coalville, Leicestershire, who ballooned to a size 32, would chomp her way through packets of biscuits, stodgy cheese sandwiches and multi-size bags of crisps until she fell asleep.

Unable to stop herself from eating, she consumed as much as she physically could until she dropped off, only to start again a few hours later when she woke in the middle of the night.

Amanda, 50, who is now a slim 12st 7lbs and a size 14, admits she was 'eating myself to death', forking out £100 on takeaways 'which could go towards my mortgage payments'.

But it wasn't until Amanda met her third husband - and her home was repossessed after she failed to pay the mortgage that she realised the extent of her eating problem.

She said:‘I had no switch-off button. I would eat and eat like a woman possessed. I’d be halfway through a sandwich or a box of chocolates when I fell asleep.

‘And if that wasn’t bad enough, I’d wake up a couple of hours later and carry on until I was physically sick.'

She continued: ‘I look back now and I’m absolutely disgusted. I was worse than an animal.’

But Amanda wasn’t always overweight . As a young girl she was very slim and through her teenage years hovered around a size 12 to 14.

It was only after Amanda had her son, Jody, now 31, that she began to struggle with her weight.

Amanada (pictured left at her wedding in 2010 and, right, looking trim today) would chomp her way through packets of biscuits, stodgy cheese sandwiches and multi-size bags of crisps until she fell asleep 

She recalls: ‘After he was born, I went up to 16 stone and was a size 20. I absolutely hated it.’

Determined to shed the extra baby pounds she contacted a local slimming company, Weightcare, and lost 7lbs, through healthy eating.

‘I felt wonderful,’ says Amanda. ‘And for years stayed at the same weight.’

But after she married her first husband in the late 1990s, her old bad habits resurfaced.

She said: ‘It wasn’t a happy marriage. I soon realised I wasn’t in love and turned to food for comfort. I’d treat myself to chocolates, packets of biscuits and crisps, to cheer myself up.

‘We’d have a takeaway most nights for tea. It could be anything from pizza, a curry or a Chinese. Before I knew it, I was a size 20 again.

‘And once we split up my unhealthy eating carried on. I just felt so low and the only thing that made me feel better was food.’

Amanda remarried in 2001 and initially dropped down to just over 11st. 

She said: ‘I was keen to impress and my husband was very thin. He could eat what he wanted and never put on any weight.’

But it wasn’t long before the weight started to pile on again. Amanda said: ‘The marriage only lasted two years. 

'I suspected he was playing away and I turned to my old friend - food - for comfort again.

‘Before we split up, I would stash food in the bedroom. It was mainly chocolate and biscuits, and I would go up there and gorge on it while my husband was downstairs. 

'I’d just eat and eat until I was physically sick.

‘By the time I actually left him, I was a size 22 and 18 stone. My self-esteem and confidence was at an all-time low.

‘I couldn’t bear the thought of going out, so would just stay in and eat all evening.’

Amanda’s life spiralled downwards even further when she couldn’t keep up with the high-interest mortgage payments on her new home.

She said: ‘My outgoings became more than my incomings and I couldn’t see a way forward. I reached rock bottom. 

'I’d never felt as low in my life. I’d gone through two divorces and my house was about to be repossessed. I’d never felt as depressed in my whole life. 

‘And just like I always had when I was low I looked to food for comfort.’ 

But Amanda’s eating habits became more extreme as she was unable to mentally stop herself from binge-eating through the night.

She recalls: ‘I’d get home from work and the first thing I’d do was order a takeaway. Within half an hour of finishing it, I would start on stodgy cheese sandwiches, super-size bags of crisps and giant-sized chocolate bars.

‘I would then literally eat non-stop until I fell asleep. My stomach would be throbbing I was so full and I’d often be sick, but even that didn’t stop me.'

Amanda (pictured above left and right) says: ‘I’m now 12st 7lbs and feel wonderful. I can go into any high street store and buy whatever clothes I want and don’t feel embarrassed by the rolls of fat I was once hiding'

She continued: ‘I would fall sleep surrounded by food. Then I’d wake up at 3am most nights. I called it my "witching hour" – it’s when I would start eating again. I would literally much through anything I could get my hands on, but it was generally more goodies.

‘I’d drop back off about 5am. By the time I got up for work, my stomach felt like lead. I felt so ill I wouldn’t be able to eat all day – but the cycle would carry on when I got home of an evening.’

Amanda’s compulsive overeating carried on for two years. 

She said: ‘Logically I knew I was doing myself so much harm, but I just couldn’t break the cycle. My mood was very low and I couldn’t see a way out.

‘I was also aware that I was spending up to £100 a week on takeaways which could go towards my mortgage payments, that works out at £20,000 over four years, but not even that was enough to stop me almost eating myself to death.  

‘I ballooned to a size 32 and weighed a staggering 28 stone. I could only wear skirts and trousers with elasticated waists and baggy tops. It was utterly soul destroying.’

In January 2010, Amanda finally lost her home after the bank repossessed it and with even more mounting debts, she declared herself bankrupt.

‘You can’t get much lower,’ she says. ‘I’d all but given up on life.’

But a few months later, Amanda met her husband, Jim Lord, 65. She recalls: ‘He is such a caring man and accepted me for who I was. He didn’t care how big I was or what I ate – he simply loved me.

‘So after we moved in together, I carried on eating ridiculously and squirrelling food up to the bedroom to eat in secret. 

'I know Jim wouldn’t have been bothered by what I ate, but I was embarrassed and didn’t want him to see how addicted to food I really was.

‘But after two years, I was at breaking point again. One night Jim came home and I burst into tears, I was so unhappy by my eating. I just cried and cried for hours.

‘Jim did his best to comfort me, but I knew I had to do something before I ended up with huge medical problems.

‘It was like a light switch had suddenly been turned on in my mind.

‘The following day, I contacted Weightcare again, who I’d lost weight with in the past. 

The owner Elaine came out to see me straight away. When she weighed me I was 27 stone 12lbs – three times what I’d once been.’

Immediately Amanda gave up takeaways, chocolates, crisps, biscuits and her ultimate guilty pleasure – stodgy butter-laden cheese sandwiches.

She says: ‘For the first time in years, I actually had three square healthy meals. I’d have eggs for breakfast, salad for lunch and chicken and vegetables for dinner.

‘At the end of the first week, I’d lost 8lbs and after a month I had shed 18lbs.

‘It felt wonderful. I stopped suffering from stomach cramps and my energy levels increased, as did my self-esteem. I stopped feeling so depressed and sorry for myself and actually looked forward to the day ahead.

‘Jim was wonderfully supportive, encouraging me every step of the way. He’d eat what I ate just to help me.’

In just two years Amanda lost an incredible 15st 7lbs, dropping from a size 32 to a trim size 14.

She says: ‘I’m now 12st 7lbs and feel wonderful. I can go into any high street store and buy whatever clothes I want and don’t feel embarrassed by the rolls of fat I was once hiding under baggy clothes.

‘I feel repulsed now when I think about what I used to eat – it was absolutely disgusting. I literally ate like a pig!

‘But now as I pull on my skinny jeans and tight fitting top it’s just the inspiration I need never to binge eat ever again.’
