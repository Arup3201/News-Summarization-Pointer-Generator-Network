The Treasury¿s Financial Secretary Sajid Javid will extend the deadline so more victims of the Equitable Life scandal can be helped

Ministers will today launch a campaign to find 400,000 ‘lost’ victims of the Equitable Life scandal who cannot be traced.

The Treasury’s Financial Secretary Sajid Javid will announce that around £1 million a day has been paid out since ministers agreed a £1.5 billion compensation scheme in 2011.

But poor data means that 400,000 of the estimated one million victims of the saga cannot be traced.

Mr Javid will today extend the deadline for claims by at least a year to give people more time to come forward.

He will also announce plans for a national advertising campaign to highlight the existence of the Equitable Life Payments Scheme to policy holders who may not realise they could be eligible for compensation.

Last night Mr Javid said: ‘This government has allocated up to £1.5bn to help the policyholders of Equitable Life who suffered an injustice, with hundreds of thousands of policy holders receiving over £700 million in payments since 2011.

‘We’ve made strong progress, but we want to maximise the number of people who will eventually receive payments, which is why we are extending the Equitable Life Payment Scheme to mid-2015.’

The near-collapse of Equitable Life in the year 2000 left hundreds of thousands of policy holders out of pocket.

Following a long campaign by the Daily Mail, Chancellor George Osborne announced a major compensation scheme to help those who lost money on their pension investments.

The latest figures show that a total of £734 million has been paid out so far.

But the Treasury has faced criticism for failing to do more to track down victims of the scandal.

Many policy-holders lost half their life savings when Equitable Life, a previously well-regarded insurer, came to the brink of collapse in 2000 after promising unrealistic annuity rates to investors.

Others have died waiting for successive governments to restore their lost money.

In July, the Commons public accounts committee said the lack of publicity about the compensation scheme meant there was a ‘real risk’ that tens of thousands of people would lose out.

The committee’s Labour chairman said she was ‘stunned’ by evidence that the Treasury had destroyed details and addresses of 353,000 policy holders provided by the Equitable Members Action Group on data protection grounds.

But Treasury sources pointed out Labour had failed to act on the scandal for a decade before Mr Osborne decided to take action.

The National Audit Office also criticised the Treasury for failing to do enough preparatory work before launching the compensation scheme.

The Treasury last night blamed poor data from Equitable Life for the failure to track down more eligible policy holders.

A source said the list of addresses provided by the firm was more than 20 years old, with some details missing altogether. More than 400,000 policies were supplied without contact addresses.

Officials are already using the electoral roll and credit records to try and track down those potentially owed compensation, as well as sending letters to victims’ last known addresses.

The compensation scheme had been due to expire in April next year, but will now be extended until ‘mid 2015’.
