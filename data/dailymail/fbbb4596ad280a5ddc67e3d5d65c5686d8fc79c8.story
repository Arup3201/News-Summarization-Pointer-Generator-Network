A John Lewis lorry driver escaped with minor injuries today after his vehicle overturned and blocked four lanes of the M1.

His cab smashed into the central reservation of the motorway in Hertfordshire shortly before 6.15am.

The 40ft truck was spread across the entire northbound carriageway at junction 8 at Hemel Hempstead.

The John Lewis driver was treated for shock after his lorry overturned blocking the northbound M1

The cab smashed through the first barrier of the central reservation shortly after 6am today

Hertfordshire Police said the driver was 'safe and well' following the crash.

He was taken to Luton and Dunstable Hospital for treatment.

East of England Ambulance Service described the driver as 'walking wounded' and said he was treated for shock. 

No other vehicles are thought to be involved according to Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire road policing unit.

The accident caused huge rush-hour tailbacks on one of the busiest stretches of motorway and huge problems for drivers trying to get to Luton Airport.

The airport warned passengers through its Twitter page to try and find an alternative route at the height of the traffic.

The motorway between junction 6 and junction 9, at Harpenden, was closed for five hours. 

The
Highways Agency said all lanes reopened shortly after 11am but there were 
tailbacks on the northbound side of the motorway of up to two hours.

'There will be residual delays,' an agency spokesman added.

Drivers experienced three-hour-long delays before traffic began moving freely.

The crash caused further problems on the M25 where queues stretched between junction 20 and 21.

There were also delays on the southbound carriageway caused by slowing traffic around the crash.

Police said the high-sided lorry had now been 'righted' following a recovery operation.

Police said emergency services were called to the reports of an 'overturned lorry' shortly before 6am, today.

A road policing unit spokesman said: 'Ambulance and the fire brigade attended as there was a report of a person trapped.

'Lanes three and four were reopened at 9.30am, but there are significant delays expected.'

A
spokesman for the Highways Agency said the hard shoulder was the only 
lane now closed, but engineers would be returning to make repairs 
overnight.
