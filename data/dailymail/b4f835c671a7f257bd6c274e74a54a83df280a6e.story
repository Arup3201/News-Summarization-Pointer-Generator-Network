Fast food fans still getting over the unpleasant sight of a Taco Bell employee licking a stack of taco shells last week should probably look away now.

An image has emerged showing a Wendy’s server filling his mouth with ice cream directly from the nozzle of a Frosty machine.

The photo is just the latest in a series of unpleasant images to go viral showing fast food employees doing things that their employers wouldn't approve off.

This vulgar image of a Wendy's employee eating ice cream direct from the Frosting machine has caused an internet sensation and led to the man losing his job

The only certainty with this PR disaster is when the fast food chain catches the culprit he will undoubtedly get sacked for doing untold damage to the chain’s brand.

The photograph surfaced on Reddit on Wednesday along with the words: ‘I was going to buy a frosty from Wendy's until I saw the employee do this’.

The photograph appears to have been taken behind the counter which suggests that the person taking it was also an employee.

Wendy’s hasn’t released a statement yet but watch this space.

Tongue lashing: This unnamed employee has lost his job after this photograph was posted to the Taco Bell Facebook page and went viral

The incident comes hot on heels of Taco Bell taking decisive action against their now infamous taco licking employee.

Fast food fans collectively wretched last week after a shocking photograph appeared on Taco Bell's official Facebook page showing a red-haired man licking a stack of unfilled shells.

The photograph was posted on June 2 by a 'Jj O'Brien Nolan' and set off a PR nightmare for the fast food chain.

Two days later, in response to a deluge of negative publicity, Taco Bell confirmed that the worker had been identified and fired.

'Our franchisee is responsible for the employment and conduct of his restaurant’s employees and he has informed us that he immediately suspended the employee shown in the photo and is in the process of terminating his employment.

'The employee who took the photo no longer works there.'

Initially it was not confirmed whether the photograph was a fake or if the tacos were indeed meant for the trash or were used in food preparation. Taco Bell denied they were.

'Our food handling procedures are strict and we have zero tolerance for any violations,' Taco Bell said in a statement.

'The taco shells were used for training in March before we launched a new product, and were in process of being thrown out.'

Despite the risks of being caught, these are only the latest examples of fast food workers getting into hot water over questionable treatment of food photographed and posted to social media.

In April, a KFC worker posted photographs of herself licking a pile of mashed potatoes on Facebook and was promptly fired by her employer.

Last year, three Burger King employees from Ohio were fired after images of them standing in two bins full of shredded lettuce were uploaded to their Facebook pages.

And in another shameful Taco Bell image, a worker tweeted a photograph of himself urinating into a plate of nachos in August last year.

‘I pissed on them where nobody could see, in private, and I threw them away. There’s literally nothing they can do. Fire me. I don’t care,’ Cameron Jankowski of Fort Wayne said of the photo.

Taco Bell took him up on his offer and he was relieved of duties immediately.
