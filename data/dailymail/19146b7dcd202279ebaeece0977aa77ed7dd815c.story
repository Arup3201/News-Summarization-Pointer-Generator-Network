Emerging from a lake, a giant amphibious drone gingerly picks its way over Russia’s Rzhevka military training ground.

This huge drone is the latest in a menagerie of automated robots to be developed worldwide, adding to what some have described as the creation of ground-based robotic armies.

Its appearance comes as large organisations, such as Google and Amazon, invest in drone technology, with some experts claiming the it could lead to a full on robotics war by 2020.

Russia is reportedly developing weaponised ground drones, including some big amphibious models such as the ones shown here

Air-based drones have been under development in Russia for some time, with reports last year that the country had been developing a new 20-tonne attack unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).

These latest images, however, provide a glimpse into Russia's future capabilities in ground-based drones.

According to Russian President Vladimir Putin, the country is aware of the potential of unmanned vehicles, but does not intend to use them the way other countries do.

‘Today they [drones] are used more and more widely in the world. We won't do it the way other countries do,’ said President Putin in November last year.

‘This is not a game, this is not a computer game, these are serious combat systems, both shock and reconnaissance versions, and it is absolutely clear that they have good prospects.

The country is reportedly developing a variety of ground-based drones including smaller six-wheeled models such as the one shown here

Last year, Google's chief Eric Schmidt warned drone technology proves a serious danger to global security.

Mr Schmidt said that the technology for armed unmanned planes will soon pass into the hands of terrorists posing huge security concerns across the globe.

He also said that ever expanding drone technology is making smaller and cheaper models, including nano-drones, which could be used by nosy neighbors spying on each other in a dispute.

'I'm not going to pass judgement on whether armies should exist, but I would prefer to not spread and democratise the ability to  fight war to every single human being,' he said.

In December, Google acquired robotic firm Boston Dynamics.

The firm, bought for an unspecified figure, is the eighth robotics company snapped up by Google in recent years.

The Russian government is also in talks to establish an organisation that will develop and produce unmanned aircraft systems, according to the Voice of Russia.

It’s not just Russia who increased invested in drone technology. Boston Dynamics, which made the Big Dog machine, was recently acquired by the internet giant Google.

The firm, bought for an unspecified figure, is the eighth robotics company snapped up by Google in recent years and is unlikely to be the last.

Three of Google’s recent acquisitions make robotic arms, used for lifting heavy weights and unloading trucks.

Another, Maku, makes androids that have eyelids, workable fingers and ears that move and flex, while another makes hi-tech cameras that were used to film recent Hollywood hit Gravity.

So what is Google, better known for running an online search engine, doing amassing a vast wealth of robotic experts and patents?

When asked whether the company is building an army of domestic servant robots, a press officer for Google in the UK laughed, before adding they didn’t know.

Google is not the only American company working on projects that might seem more akin to a Hollywood blockbuster.

Amazon recently announced plans to begin offering some deliveries by airborne drones.

Called ‘Octocopters’, the flying robots will take orders directly from the warehouse to homes or offices following GPS satellites and could be ready in five years.

‘I know this looks like science  fiction, but it’s not,’ said Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos.

Company sources also recently said the group was working on even more ambitious and futuristic projects – but refused to elaborate on what they might be.
