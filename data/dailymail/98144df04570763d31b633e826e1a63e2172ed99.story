Andy Murray could step into the shoes, or rather underpants of David Beckham, after trademarking boxer shorts and lingerie bearing his name.

The Wimbledon champion has registered his name as a trademark with the  Intellectual Property Office (IPO), which will cover branded knickers, suspenders, boxer shorts, socks and dresses.

However, Murray fans hoping the tennis ace is about to launch his own underwear brand, as Beckham did last year with H&M, are set for disappointment as the sportsman is thought to have made the move to stop others cashing in on his fame with unlicensed merchandise.

Net profit: Wimbledon Champion Andy Murray has trademarked his name, including on items such as lingerie, suspenders and boxer shorts

Murray's trademark covers more than 100 items, including computer games, sportswear, DVDs and stationary, as well as more unusual items such as Halloween costumes, greetings cards, toy dolls, slippers, bath toys, roller skates, colouring books, paddling pools and surf boards.

Although Murray's team say he is unlikely to bring out his own lingerie line, the trademark will prevent others from doing so.

'It's unlikely he'll make millions 
selling sexy bras with 'Andy Murray' written on them but who knows? With
 this trademark being approved it means that he could if he ever wanted 
to,' a source told The Sun.

In action: Murray takes to the court during the Australian Open this week. Although his team say he is unlikely to bring out his own underwear range, the trademark will prevent others from doing so

Safeguards: The trademark will also protect firms who have signed a deal with the sportsman to sell items bearing his name - including Adidas

The application to the IPO from Murray's new company 77 Management Limited, comes after a number of other attempts to trademark his name were made by others unconnected to the tennis ace.

There had already been attempts made to trademark 'Andy Murray', 'Andy Murray Wimbledon Winner', and 'Andy Murray Tennis Champion'.

It was rubber stamped on Boxing Day after no objections to the trademark were received.

The reigning BBC Sports Personality of 
the Year's move is understood to be part of a plan by his management 
team to turn him into a global brand, with other stars who have 
successful trademarked their names, including David and Victoria Beckham.

Murray's tennis rival Roger Federer successfully trademarked the logo of his RF brand.

And Real Madrid footballer Gareth Bale has trademarked his heart-shaped goal celebration as a logo.

David Potter, the head of trademarks legal team at Harrison Goddard Foote, who handled Murray's application, said the trademark would stop goods being produced under Murray's brand without permission.

The trademark will also protect firms who have signed a deal with the sportsman to sell items bearing his name - including Adidas, Head rackets, and water company Highland Spring.

'It gives the person the legal monopoly over their own name to stop counterfeit use, and to be able to licence the name to third parties,' he said.

Precedent: Andy Murray could now follow in the footsteps of David Beckham, who has a range of underwear with H&M
