Premier League referee Mark Clattenburg will miss next weekend’s round of fixtures for breaking protocol so he could watch an Ed Sheeran concert. 

January 1, 2013, three minutes into the match between West Ham United and Norwich City, Mark Clattenburg gave a penalty. 

Guy Demel looped a long ball into the area and Clattenburg judged Ryan Bennett to have grappled unfairly with Winston Reid. It seemed like a brave new world. 

If every referee did that, penalty-box wrestling would be at an end. But nothing happened.

Referees did not follow Clattenburg’s lead. Clattenburg did not even follow Clattenburg’s lead, and has let similar incidents pass since. 

So why that foul on that day? Who knows? There was no new directive, no change of policy. In retrospect, it was almost whimsical.

If referees were genuinely interested in ridding the game of this ill, it would take one weekend of action. 

If every grab brought a penalty award, we would see a quick round of 6-6 draws and then it would be over. Anything not stopped is encouraged. 

There is little point blaming Manchester United’s defenders for their WWE turns against Chelsea on Sunday. 

It is not as if Chelsea’s defenders have never resisted that way. Indeed, every defender does it, and for one reason: because he can.
