Police have charged Aaron Hernandez with murder and weapons counts in connection with the slaying of a semi-pro American football player whose body was found in an industrial park about a mile from Hernandez's home.

Hernandez was taken from his home in handcuffs on Wednesday morning and, less than two hours after his arrest, the New England Patriots announced they had cut him from their team. He is being held without bail.

The investigation started more than a week ago after semi-pro football player Odin Lloyd was found slain in an industrial park in North Attleboro, on the Rhode Island line not far from where the Patriots play.

Charged: Aaron Hernandez was charged with murder and weapons counts on Wednesday afternoon

Hearing: A member of the state's attorney's office went through the detailed evidence against Hernandez

Lucrative: New England awarded Hernandez five-year contract worth $40 million last year

Lloyd's family says he and Hernandez were friends and that Lloyd's girlfriend and Hernandez's fiancee are sisters.

'Words cannot express the disappointment we feel knowing that one of 
our players was arrested as a result of this investigation,' the 
Patriots said in a statement. 'We realize that law enforcement 
investigations into this matter are ongoing. We support their efforts 
and respect the process. At this time, we believe this transaction is 
simply the right thing to do.'

Video emerged of Hernandez being taken 
from his home in handcuffs, which followed after Massachusetts state 
police - wearing wetsuits and armed with metal detectors - combed 
through a stream near his home yesterday.

However, the officers left 
empty-handed after turning up no new evidence in the execution-style 
murder of semi-pro football player Lloyd, who was reportedly last 
seen partying with Hernandez in Boston.

Lloyd, a semi-pro football player, was friends with Hernandez and was with him on Monday morning before he was shot in the head.

His
body was dumped in an industrial park less than a mile from Hernandez's
luxury home in the Boston suburb of North Attleboro, Massachusetts.

Fruitless: The officers left the area empty-handed after being unable to find any evidence

Holed up: Hernandez returned to his mansion in North Attleboro Friday and remained indoors all day

Separate surveillance videos show Hernandez outside Lloyd’s home 
about an hour before the incident, and then walking into his own North 
Attleboro, Massachusetts, mansion after the shots were heard, according to the TV station.

Hernandez
returned to his Massachusetts home Friday amid speculations of an 
impending arrest just as it was announced that he has lost an 
endorsement deal.

The 
tight end had been drinking in a Boston bar with some friends on Sunday 
night - including  Lloyd, who was found shot dead 
'execution style' hours later.

Victim: Odin Lloyd has been identified as the man who was found dead less than a mile away from the $1.3million mansion of New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez

Media circus: A crowd of reporters outside Hernandez's house

ABC News
reported that Hernandez's security system was 
smashed - including the surveillance videos. He also handed over his 
cell phone to investigators 'in pieces.'

This week, Hernandez was sued by his 
former friend and personal assistant Alexander Bradley over 
claims that he shot Bradley in the face during a fight at a Miami 
nightclub in February.

Bradley
claims he lost one eye when a gun owned by Hernandez went off in his 
car as they drove away together following a heated argument.

Hernandez became a key player for the Patriots, forming a formidable tight end partnership with Rob Gronkowski.

New
England drafted Hernandez out of the University of Florida in 2010. 
Last summer, the team gave him a five-year contract worth $40 million.
