The two men charged with allegedly planning to carry out a brutal terrorist attack in Sydney will plead not guilty.

Omar Al-Kutobi, 24, and Mohammad Kiad, 25, were charged with planning to commit a terrorist act in February, allegedly hours before they planned to carry out the attack.

Police allegedly seized a machete, a hunting knife, a homemade Islamic State flag and a video recording that detailed their planned attack.

However, criminal lawyer Adam Houda - who is representing the men - said the video was 'not convincing', according to the Sydney Morning Herald.

'The matter will be defended, there will be a plea of not guilty,' Mr Houda said

'The matter will be defended, there will be a plea of not guilty,' Mr Houda said outside court.

'From what I've seen the central feature of this case is this video.

'I've seen the video and it's not convincing.'

'Mr Houda also the trial had been prejudiced by Tony Abbott, who read out details of that video in Parliament. 

'He wants to milk this situation politically for all it's worth,' Mr Houda told media in February.

'The unfortunate result is that it will also bring unfair prejudice to the matters before the court and also undermine the court process.' 

The case will return to court in May. 

When the men were first in court, Commonwealth DPP prosecutor Kay Marenos said the brief of evidence against the men was four pages long 'but that is likely to change' and included photographs and a short video.

Facebook pictures of  Kiad, who immigrated to Australia from Kuwait in 2009, revealed his fashion interest and showed him sporting expensive watches and suits as well as making some strange fashion statements

Mr Kiad entered Australia in 2012, where he had worked as a nurse - but when he arrived in Australia he found he could not transfer his skills. He was granted a visa under the family and spousal visa arrangements and recently took up a job as a removalist but was fired and was on the dole at the time of his arrest, it has been reported.

Attorney-General George Brandis told parliament on Wednesday: 'Significantly, police also located a video recording of one suspect kneeling in front of an ISIL (IS) flag, with the knife and machete, making a politically-motivated statement, threatening to undertake violent acts with those weapons.'

A Sydney police station and officers on the street were revealed to have been the the targets with attacks scheduled for just before midnight on Tuesday, Channel Nine reported.

Mr Al-Kutobi was granted citizenship in 2013 and was studying to be a nurse while Mr Kiad, originally from Kuwait where he immigrated from in 2009, was reported to have been recently fired from his removalist job.

While some neighbours told Fairfax that he was 'friendly', 'open minded about religion' and 'never talked about Islam', others admitted he and Mr Al-Katobi had begun acting differently after the anti-terror raids in western Sydney last September.

'He began wearing a scarf, just like ISIS and Mohammad, he grew a long beard,' Neighbour Michael David said of Al-Kutobi.

'I heard them praying in there [the granny flat] and reading the Koran,' said Mr David, who speaks Arabic. 

Ms Jeisele-Brown said the pair had fallen out with another neighbour over the last month or two for 'speaking sharp' and that she had been upset with them after finding a religious picture of hers dumped in the rubbish bin.

'I had been in hospital having chemotherapy and when I came back home my picture of Jesus Christ was missing,' she said.

'I found it in the rubbish. I don't know who dumped it but I thought ... I didn't say anything.'

Neighbours Teresita Heisele-Brown said she had noticed that after the Martin place siege, the two men had had lengthy discussions in Arabic and had watched a lot of television, perhaps coverage of the a siege.

She said when the police came around to arrest the pair, Mohammad had pretended he didn't speak English.

She said detectives had made the men lie on the ground while they handcuffed them.

Their home, workplaces and cars were all searched by police.
