Behind bars: Ben Westwood has been jailed for nine years after he drove at speeds of up to 180mph during a police chase

A getaway driver who hit speeds of 180mph during a 65-mile police chase was jailed yesterday.

Ben Westwood left a trail of sparks and flames as he fled from a robbery scene in a stolen Audi RS5.

During the pursuit on the M6, he almost outran a police helicopter and left officers in high-performance BMWs trailing in his wake. The 33-year-old is thought to be the fastest speeding driver ever to be prosecuted in the UK.

Westwood was caught on January 13 after police officers spotted him and his gang attempting to break open a cash machine at a Murco petrol station in Penn, West Midlands.

While three of the gang were arrested at the scene, the getaway driver and accomplice Gregory Simpson, 26, headed off in the Audi at speed towards the M6.

They managed to evade capture for more than an hour during the dramatic chase.

At one stage, Westwood drove the 
supercar in the wrong direction down a slip road at 70mph towards an 
onrushing police car. It avoided crashing by veering out of the way. 
Westwood eventually abandoned the £85,000 vehicle outside a block of 
flats in Wolverhampton, where he was found hiding with Simpson.

Pursuit: Westwood drove for 65 miles along the M6 motorway as he sped from police for more than an hour

The car – one of only two of its 
kind, fitted with a Lamborghini engine and race car brakes – is so 
distinctive officers managed to link it to 15 smash-and-grab raids 
across the Midlands that have earned the gang more than £50,000 in 
cigarettes, cash and jewellery since August last year.

When officers 
seized the car, which had been resprayed black and disguised with a 
false plate, they discovered it had clocked up 1,500 miles since it was 
stolen.

Sentencing Westwood, of Wednesfield, 
West Midlands to nine years in prison, Recorder Nigel Baker said the 
jail term reflected ‘an atrocious piece of dangerous driving’.

Stefan Kolodynski, prosecuting at 
Wolverhampton Crown Court, said: ‘Despite the BMW being a powerful car, 
it was absolutely no match for the Audi.

‘It was driven for over an hour before it eventually stopped. The driving was dangerous.

‘The police helicopter indicated the Audi was reaching speeds of 180mph, maybe even faster.

‘It was highly likely that if he 
stayed on the motorway, then he would have outrun that helicopter.’ 
Westwood, who was jailed for dangerous driving, conspiracy to burgle and
 conspiracy to steal, was said to be the leader of the gang.

He was previously jailed for four and
 a half years for being part of a gang which stole luxury cars by taking
 keys from owners’ homes.

Simpson, said to have been Westwood’s
 ‘lieutenant’, was sentenced to four years. Ramesh Sharma, 38, Stephen 
Green, 41, and Luke Watkins, 34, all received at least three years in 
jail for conspiracy to steal.

A spokesman for West Midlands Police said: ‘The Audi was specifically stolen because it could outrun police cars.

‘The offences we have been able to 
prove are probably just the  tip of the iceberg of the true number of 
those that this car was involved in.’
