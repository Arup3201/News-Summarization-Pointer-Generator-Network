An wildlife enthusiast has scooped the top prize in a photography competition with a unique image showing a dolphin surfing in the waves.

The dolphin's eye view shot was captured off the coast of Northern Ireland by George Karbus, from County Clare, Ireland.

He swam in the surf with the marine mammal to get the winning image in the British Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition and secure the £5,000 prize.

Mr Karbus said: 'Each time the dolphin got into the wave, I dived underneath, held my breath and waited for the moment when he would swish through a silver barrel close enough to my lens.

'From blue tits to badgers, never has British wildlife looked more beautiful.'
