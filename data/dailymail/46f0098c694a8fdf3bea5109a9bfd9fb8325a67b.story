A jealous boyfriend was left to murder his own six-month-old baby, ex-girlfriend and her mother in an arson attack after police failed to investigate his 'escalating' behaviour, a report has found.

Triple killer Carl Mills sent his girlfriend Kayleigh Buckley, 17, threatening texts and said he would 'burn her house down', but officers did not arrest him despite complaints from her family. 

Just 20 days after the family reported criminal damage at their Cwmbran home, the 17-year-old was killed along with her baby Kimberley and mother Kim, 46, in a house fire  as they slept. 

Carl Mills, 31, was jailed for a minimum of 35 years in 2013 for the three murders after the arson attack in September 2012.

An investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission found the police handling of the family's complaints 'fell well short of the standard expected'.

The report also said Gwent Police's checks on triple killer's background were 'inadequate' and standards of 'good practice' were not met.

Both the PC and acting sergeant have been disciplined for failing to handle a complaint from Kim Buckley that Mills had damaged their home at Cwmbran, South Wales.

The review found Mills, from Bolton, was involved in 45 incidents of violence committed against his mother Dawn Mills. 

The IPCC report said: 'On 29 August 2012, Kim Buckley attended Cwmbran police station to report criminal damage at her home and alleged that Mr Mills, her daughter's boyfriend, was responsible.

'A police constable took a statement and, along with a temporary police sergeant, took responsibility for dealing with the allegation.

'The IPCC investigation found that the allegation of criminal damage was not acted upon and that potential lines of enquiry were not followed.

'In relation to the police constable, the investigation found the officer did not identify, or act on, Mr Mills' escalating behaviour including text messages that threatened harm, and his actual criminal acts of theft.

'The constable did not interrogate available databases or contact Social Services. The acting sergeant failed to intrusively supervise the constable to check that investigatory tasks had been carried out.'

The murder trial at Newport Crown Court heard how Mills bombarded his former partner Kayleigh with threatening texts and warned her: 'I will burn your house down.'

Mills torched the family home in September 2012 - on the day his prematurely-born baby daughter came home from hospital after spending her first six months in a neo-natal unit.

The obsessive boyfriend was living in a tent near the family home in Cwmbran and had been banned from seeing his child unsupervised. 

In the wake of the killings and Mills's trial at Newport Crown Court, three reports were ordered - a Serious Case Review (SCR), a Domestic Homicide Review (DHR) and an investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).

All three have been released and Gwent Police has been criticised for failing to find out about Mills' background.

In his review for the South East Wales Safeguarding Children Board barrister David Spicer said: 'It is rarely possible to assert that had matters been handled differently the serious incident that has led to the deaths of children would not have occurred.

'But if the information available in Bolton concerning Mills' history had been properly researched and considered, and appropriate interagency processes and planning had taken place, the risks would have been better understood and it is likely that action would have been taken that was more likely to protect the family from the extreme act which caused their deaths.' 

The pair met on Facebook in 2010 when she was 15 and within months the killer, then 26, moved to Cwmbran.

Ms Buckley got police and social services involved because she was concerned about their relationship given her daughter's age. 

But once Kayleigh turned 16 social workers and police stopped treating her as a child at risk of abuse but as a 'young person making bad choices'.

Mr Spicer said child protection staff knew Mills was grooming Kayleigh but failed to treat it as child sexual exploitation. 

Mills repeatedly threatened to murder Kayleigh and their baby and burn down the house.

He sent a barrage of abusive texts to her in the days before the blaze. 

The review found references in records that describe the abuse play down its seriousness, 'normalise' what was happening and 'allocated an inappropriate level of responsibility to the victim'. 

Mills, who had previously ignored court-ordered psychiatric treatment, attacked the home because he wrongly believed Kayleigh was in a relationship with another man.

The review found the volume of information coming to Gwent Police from checks caused difficulties with 'administering the collection of data'.

A local decision was made to 'switch off' the data, which then became irretrievable.

The review, which makes numerous recommendations to tighten procedures, has not been able to establish who made the decision.

A retired senior officer who was contacted did not reply to a letter or take part in the review.
