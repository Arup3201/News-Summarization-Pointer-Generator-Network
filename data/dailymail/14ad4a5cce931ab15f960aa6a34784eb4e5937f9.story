A David Bowie fan has spent over £20,000 creating a shrine packed with the singer's memorabilia.

Louise Moody has been dubbed the 'Keen Genie', in reference to the glam rocker's hit Jean Genie, due to her devout obsession with the musician.

The 24-year-old from Stretford, Manchester, has spent £5,000 having pictures of the star's face and Space Oddity designs tattooed on her body - even though at 67 he is 43 years her senior.

Louise Moody, 24, Manchester, has built up a David Bowie collection worth £20,000 since the age of 11 that includes signed pictures and books. She has also spent £5,000 on tattoos dedicated to him 

She has also splashed out on Bowie clothes, signed photos and magazine cuttings of her idol, which adorn her bedroom walls at her home. 

The superfan began building up her vast collection from the age of 11, by getting her hands on everything and anything Bowie-related. 

Louise's obsession began when she heard her mother Jane play his greatest hits album over dinner and was captivated by him.

Three years later, she was able to see the music legend in person with her mother as they watched him live in concert at the MEN Arena in 2003.

She said: 'I started collecting clippings and T-shirts with the little pocket money I had when I was a kid and my mum surprised me by taking me to see him live in 2003 when I was 14.' 

'It was the most incredible experience of my life and since then I pledged to see him again one day, however he has hardly toured since.'

Louise is so dedicated  that she transforms herself into his alter ego Ziggy Stardust, for nights out (right)

It has taken Louise 13 years to put together her collection of books, magazine clippings and signed albums

Louise's love of the Aladdin Sane artist started at the age of 11 when her mum played his greatest hits

While her friends at school would listen to Arctic Monkeys and The Killers while debating the latest number one chart hit, Louise would listen to what her pals would playfully describe as 'dad rock'. 

Louise admits that her ever-growing collection has now begun to take over her home. 

She said: 'All of my memorabilia spreads through the house, my books and DVDs go on the shelf but my magazine cuttings are stored in loads of folders - I have even had to put them in folders that I keep recipes and things in because I have so many. 

'I am hoarding them for no reason as I don't use them.

The project designer now owns every single David Bowie album available, many as vinyl records 

As well as her music and book collection, Louise has adorned herself with £5,000 worth of tattoos

Much of Louise's clothing features David Bowie logos or motifs including his face, birth date and guitar

'If there was a fire in the house, the first thing I would save would be my expensive Bowie stuff, my signed picture would definitely be up there. I would get as much as I could get really.

'In my old room, the walls were lined with pictures and posters of him.

'A lot of people say it's strange that a young girl can have such an obsession with an artist in a completely different generation, but I fell in love with him the minute I heard his music.'

As well as dedicating her interiors to the icon, project designer Louise has even styled her appearance to look more like her idol. 

Louise  regularly goes on nights out dressed as Bowie's iconic character Ziggy Stardust and has modelled her dyed red hair to match his iconic look.

Louise says that she has written to her idol on several occasions but is yet to receive a reply

She said: 'David Bowie has influenced my life so much, I dress like him and my hair is the same colour as his on one of his album covers.

'I dyed it that colour a few years ago and was gutted when I had to dye my hair brown for my job but since I have moved jobs I have been able to dye my hair back.'

Louise said that her obsession became so great that she even took to copying some of his lifestyle choices to be more like him. 

'I even started smoking Marlboro lights when I found out he smoked them. I just love everything about him. 

'It is my dream to meet him and I wouldn't even think about shelling out more than £1,000 to see him live again.'

Some of Louise's most prized possessions include those that have been personally signed by Bowie 

Louise now owns every album and single he has ever made and admits that she still holds out hope of meeting him one day.

She said: 'I think if I met him I would scream and faint, it's giving me goosebumps just thinking about it. 

'All I ever think about is him and I don't think any other music I have heard.' 

However, Louise says that every attempt at contacting the star has so far been fruitless.

She said: 'I have written letters to his fan club but never heard back - at the time I was only a teenager and it really upset me but it never lowered my hopes of one day meeting him.

'I can't help myself, if I see anything with his face on it I must have it, regardless of the price.'
