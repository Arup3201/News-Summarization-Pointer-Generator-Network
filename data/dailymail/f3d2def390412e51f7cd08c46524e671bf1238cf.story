Harry Camilleri, 34, has been jailed for 10 months after stealing £45,000 from 35 customer deposits

A Mercedes-Benz salesman stole £45,000 from 35 customer deposits for luxury cars to fund his online betting addiction.

Harry Camilleri, 34, one of the company's highest earners, has been jailed for 10 months after handing himself in to police and admitting theft.

The father-of-one had a large portfolio of prestige buyers and earned £65,000 in commission, on top of a £12,000 salary, at the showroom in Manchester city centre.

But he squandered his earnings and ran up debts 'chasing the next big win' online betting, Manchester Crown Court heard.

Judge Robert Brown refused a defence appeal to suspend Camilleri's sentence so he could start a new job and pay all the money back.

Camilleri's systematic thefts went unnoticed for 18 months, until a customer paying for a car questioned why they had been given two separate account numbers by Camilleri in April this year.

Confronted by bosses, 'highly trusted' Camilleri told them it was an honest mistake.

But the following day he handed in his resignation, and bosses decided to launch an investigation.

The day after, Camilleri handed himself in to police and revealed all, telling an officer, 'gambling is my illness'.

He admitted deceiving customers into paying deposits into his own account.

Camilleri would then transfer some, but not all the money into the company account.

By the time he was arrested, he had stolen between £500 and £10,000 from 35 different customers' deposits.

Neil Nehra, prosecuting, said: 'The defendant was employed for nine years and was a well-respected salesman. He was described by the management team as one of the high performers of the company.'

Camilleri, of Blackpool, has since repaid £10,000 of the money, and had company payments withheld, bringing the balance of the money owed to £26,000.

Adrian Palmer, defending, said: 'It's clear there's a long-standing difficulty with addiction to gambling, but he's a man who works extremely hard - a well-paid, well-respected man who has let himself and his family down.'

Mr Palmer said Camilleri's relationship with the mother of his young daughter had broken down following the revelations, and so he had to move back in with his parents in Blackpool.

He also said that Camilleri had banned himself from online betting accounts as he sought help for his addiction.
