A paraglider is considering giving up the extreme sport after smashing into a hillside in his third serious crash since taking it up the sport. 

Adam Palk, 43, is recovering with a compressed spine after careering into the side of Leckhampton Hill in Cheltenham.

He was airlifted to hospital after crashing into the steep section of the hill on Tuesday.

Mr Palk, who makes sculpture for gardens,  almost died in another crash in 2006 when his canopy opened just 30ft from the ground, after smashing his ribs in a crash in the 1990s. 

After the three near-death experiences, Mr Palk is considering giving up the sport before he is killed.

He said: 'It all went through my spine when I hit the side of the hill. It was like ‘splat’. I only got back into paragliding three years ago.

After surviving his third serious crash since taking up the sport, Mr Palk is considering a change of hobby

'I’m lucky, I was up at 1,000ft earlier on but I came down lower and was sort-of hanging out a bit in the air.

'The wind dropped and the outside of the wing tip folded under the canopy. I was left flying on half a wing.

'I
spun round and was dumped into the hill. It was around 20mph. I put my 
legs out to stop the impact. I had to do something. It felt like I had 
been hit by a bus.

'It’s the third time I’ve fallen out of the sky. My mum isn’t very happy with me. But I need to have a good think about the future.

'I think it’s better to be on the ground wishing you were up in the sky than in the sky, wishing you were on the ground. I think my luck may have run out.'

Mr Palk, who runs Get High Paragliding, a group for paragliding enthusiasts in Cheltenam and the Cotswolds to organise handling days together.

He is going to use the period of his recovery to consider whether he will ever take to the skies again.

He added: 'It’s not worth the risk. Thank God I can still feel my feet. It’s not worth the thrill of flying. You don’t realise how easy it is for something to go wrong.'
