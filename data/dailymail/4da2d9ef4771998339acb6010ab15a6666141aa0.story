Like father like son: Nicholas Lyndhurst said his son Archie had the 'acting gene' but the Only Fools And Horses star said he did wonder 'what sort of industry he'll enter'

Nicholas Lyndhurst has condemned the current state of television, comparing ‘cruel’ Britain’s Got Talent to the Bedlam asylum of the pre-Victorian era.

The former Only Fools And Horses actor said that the BBC1 sitcom, which starred Lyndhurst and David Jason as Rodney and Derek Trotter, would not be made today. Lyndhurst, 52, who has replaced Alun Armstrong in detective series New Tricks, said his son Archie had the ‘acting gene’ and was a pupil at the Sylvia Young Theatre School.

But he told Radio Times: ‘I wonder, though, what sort of industry he’ll enter. I can hardly say, “Do all this training and the best thing will be Celebrity Dog Watch”.

'Take away the talent shows, celebrity cook shows, skating, dog training, dancing, putting people on an island – and what’s left?’

He added: ‘Britain’s Got Talent? Hundreds of years ago we were selling tickets to Bedlam. It’s become like that. It’s cruel to watch these deluded people.’

Only Fools And Horses, penned by John Sullivan, was not an instant hit when it was first broadcast in 1981 but went on to smash records with 24.3 million viewers for an episode in 1996.

Lyndhurst said: 'Only Fools would never be made today, nor Dad’s Army. TV companies turn down good scripts because they’re not prepared to let them develop.

'A talent show will pick up seven million viewers and they can’t afford to nurture something that initially will only have a million.'

Lyndhurst appears in the tenth series of cold case series New Tricks, co-starring Dennis Waterman, Amanda Redman and Denis Lawson.

Redman will be replaced by ex-EastEnders actress Tamzin Outhwaite when she leaves the BBC1 series, and Lyndhurst admitted: 'You have to worry if it will continue to be successful.

'Lots of shows that run a decade-plus have familiarity. It’s comforting to see people you think you know in different situations. Our viewers are people who don’t want to play catch-up on their phones.'

Lyndhurst also confirmed that he turned down the 1997 film The Full Monty, about unemployed steel workers who form a male striptease act.
