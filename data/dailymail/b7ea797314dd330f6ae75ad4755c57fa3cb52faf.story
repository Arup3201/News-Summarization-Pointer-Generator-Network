Insistence: Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said the controversial HS2 line was the only way to tackle gridlock on Britain's rail network

There is no alternative to the controversial high speed HS2 project if Britain’s rail network is to avoid gridlock, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin insisted today.

When asked by MP watchdogs if he was ‘completely satisfied‘ the £50billion line from London to Birmingham and beyond was the best option to increase capacity, he declared: ‘I am’.

He said: ’Nothing else does the job as efficiently as HS2 will do.’

He also suggested he was open to appeals to start building ‘from the north’ towards the Midlands to fast-track the building process of the HS2 scheme.

He said: ‘I get the message about people wanting to see it done faster.’

It was Mr McLoughlin’s first appearance before the Transport Select committee after publication of his 50,000 page HS2 Hybrid Bill on Monday.

The document paves the way for work to start on the first phase from London to Birmingham - to be completed by 2026.

Mr McLoughlin told the committee: ‘HS2 is vital to the economy and the future prosperity of the UK.’

He told MPs that HS2 was about creating more long-term capacity and connectivity  ‘not just about faster trains’. In future ‘everyone will wonder how we managed without it’.

The 50,000 page report says the HS2 project will require demolition of 339 dwellings and 21 community facilities and destroy two areas of sites of special scientific interest (SSSI).

It also says HS2 will require 2,500hectars of high-quality and 2,300hectrares of poorer quality agricultural land and will directly affect 18 Grade II listed buildings.

The extent to which homes, the environment, beauty spots and local communities will be blighted is buried within the vast 50,000 pages of the new HS2 Bill

It will also generate 128 million tonnes of excavated material and almost 5 million tonnes of waste to be disposed of to landfill.

Some 67 dwellings will be ‘significantly affected by noise from the operation of the railway,’ it says.

The Woodland Trust says HS2 between London and Birmingham will destroy 21 ancient woods.

Asked what odds he would put on HS2 actually being completed, Mr McLoughlin said: ‘HS2 is absolutely essential so I'm 100% confident it is the right thing for the UK.’

Creating a conventional non-high speed line would still cost 90 per cent of HS2 project, so the extra marginal expense was justified, he said.

There are:

MPs asked Mr McLoughlin if scrapping first class and lengthening trains and platforms on the West Coast mainline was a better way of spending the money.

He said such measures would have only ‘a little impact for a little while’ and ‘would not provide us with a long-term solution’.

On HS2 ticket prices he said: ‘We want fares to be competitive so that people can make the choice of either using the high-speed line or travelling by other routes.’

But he denied the Treasury had tried to ‘sabotage’ the scheme over spiralling costs, insisting he had the full support of Prime Minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne.

The estimated cost of the full HS2 scheme - comprising phase one and phase two north of Birmingham - is £42.6 billion plus £7.5 billion for the trains.

But Mr McLoughlin said he was confident the estimated £21.6billion figure for phase one could be reduced to £17.16 billion.

Top City accountant authors of a Government-commissioned pro-HS2 report stood by their  sums that the high-speed rail scheme will generate £15 billion of economic benefit a year by 2037 – despite scepticism from critics who said it was ‘made up.’

KPMG’s infrastructure head Richard Threlfall rejected suggestions their report  had  ‘played down’ the areas of the country that  would lose out from HS2 compared with those that would benefit most, but noted: ‘It's inevitable that any large infrastructure project attracts a degree of controversy.’

Link: The project, estimated to cost around £50 billion, is intended to link London to Birmingham by 2026, with two branches then heading to Manchester and Leeds, via Sheffield, being built by 2033

Lawyers for the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE)   have threatened legal action against the Government as  citizens are given fewer than 60 days over Christmas and New Year holidays to actually read the 50,000 page document it before consultation closes on January 24.

The print copy fills around 20ft of book shelving tough Mr McLoughlin brandished a memory stick before MPs on which the entire volumes were available in digital form.

Ministers deny acting illegally and stand by the  HS2 timetable.

Labour backs HS2 but says PM David Cameron must ‘get a grip’ on ballooning costs while the TSSA rail union fears HS2 may become a ‘rich man’s toy’.
