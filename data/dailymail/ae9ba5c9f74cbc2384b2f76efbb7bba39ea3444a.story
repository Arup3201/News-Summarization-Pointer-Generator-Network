A spectator ran on to the circuit at Leicester Racecourse and sprinted alongside the horses, narrowly avoiding a horrific accident.

Jockies riding in the Cream Gorse Handicap were forced to steer their horses either side of the man, who was wearing a pink shirt and black trousers, to avoid him.

In a desperate attempt to garner a few seconds of fame, the spectator left the stands, leaped over the fence and started running towards the finish line.

Luckily no-one was injured and the race was completed as scheduled.

After he made his way onto the turf, the group quickly overtook the man.

It is not known if any action was taken against the streaker, but previous attempts to run on the track have ended in tragedy.

The race was won by pre-race favourite Illustrious Prince, ridden by Jockey Freddie Tylicki and trained by Julie Camacho.

Available, ridden by Jimmy Quinn, came second, with Joe Doyle riding Darnathean home in third place.
