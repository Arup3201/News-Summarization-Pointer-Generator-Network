We’ve got Rory McIlroy hosting the Irish Open next year and Paul Lawrie launching his own Saltire Energy Match Play tournament in his hometown of Aberdeen in July. Thomas Bjorn is the man behind an event in Denmark. Now, I can reveal, the leading English players are ready to play their part as well.

Beginning in October next year, the British Masters will be held for the first time since 2008, with Ian Poulter, Luke Donald, Lee Westwood and Justin Rose taking it in turns to play the role of host.

The rotation will begin with Poulter welcoming the great and good to the course in England with which he has long been associated — Woburn.

‘I can’t wait,’ Poulter told Sportsmail. ‘It has been far too long since Woburn hosted a tour event.

‘When you think of the history there, with wins for the likes of Seve (Ballesteros), (Nick) Faldo and Woosie (Ian Woosnam), it deserves to have a European Tour event again.

‘It has been in fantastic condition for the last few years. It will be a great week and obviously a very proud one for me.’

Donald was equally enthusiastic. ‘We’ve been going on about England having another event for long enough and it’s great that it looks like it is finally going to happen,’ he said.

‘Let’s hope we can find the right date in the calendar. We’ve all seen how the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth has grown over the years. It’s now one of the best events we play and I’m sure the fans would flock to a good tournament in October. It seems like a perfect fit.’

‘What an incredible 2014. Congrats. I see Green in Spring of 2015.’

Australian Greg Norman salutes Rory McIlroy on the eve of the Northern Irishman’s final appearance of his amazing season — the defence of his Aussie Open title in Sydney this week. He also predicts that Rory will complete the career Grand Slam at the Masters next April at the age of just 25.

Is there a particular course where Donald would like to play host?

‘I think I’ll have to get back to the UK and play a few of the courses like Walton Heath and Woburn and see which one would suit me,’ said the Chicago-based 36-year-old, smiling. The British Masters didn’t feature on the 2015 European Tour schedule which was released on Sunday, but tour officials are confident it will take place in the currently vacant week of October 8-11.

‘There’s a couple of Is and Ts to dot and cross but we don’t foresee any problems,’ said a tour official. ‘I’m sure it will happen.’

The event would follow the Alfred Dunhill Links and take place a fortnight before the start of the four-event Final Series in China.

The British Masters was last played at Woburn in 2002, when Rose prevailed following a thrilling duel against Poulter.

In the years since, Rose has become a major champion, Poulter a Ryder Cup legend and Westwood and Donald have reached No 1 in the world. Now comes the revival of an iconic tournament, and a fitting way to recognise their achievements.

Who is Tiger Woods' mysterious new coach?

From America to Australia to the Middle East, the same question on various tours around the world was being asked on Saturday night: who the heck is Chris Como?

Such was the clamour to find out something about Tiger Woods’ new mystery swing coach, Como’s website crashed only minutes after the news was released and his Twitter account gained several thousand more followers overnight.

Turns out Como is a 37-year-old Texan who has worked with the likes of South African Trevor Immelman and Australian Aaron Baddeley and has a healthy interest in golfing biomechanics — in other words, helping players swing the club in a manner that avoids injury.

Tiger Woods last played at the US PGA Championship and has appointed Chris Como as a new swing coach

Given Tiger’s problems, if the new man comes up with something that keeps Woods  fit and playing for the next decade he’ll become as famous as Perry Como.

Woods was introduced to the fourth swing coach of his 20-year career by his long-time friend from his university days, Notah Begay, whose own career was curtailed by a back injury.

‘Subsequently, Chris and I had several good conversations about the golf swing,’ said Woods. ‘I’ve worked with him for about a month since I started practising again, and Chris will consult and work with me during the year.’

The first fruits of their collaboration will be seen when Woods returns to the game in the tournament he hosts, the Hero World Challenge, in Florida next week.

With this news following his criticism of a much commented-upon article in Golf Digest, which he called a ‘grudge-fuelled piece of character assassination’, Woods is certainly doing his bit to drum up publicity.
