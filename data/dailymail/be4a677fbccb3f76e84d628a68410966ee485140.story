With the average house price in England rocketing to £279,000, getting on the property ladder can feel out of reach for many.

But for the same price as a studio flat in Balham, south London, a potential buyer could snap up a Victorian pub that comes complete with a huge bar, function room and 21 bedrooms.

The historic grade II listed Fleece Hotel in Richmond, Yorkshire, has gone up for sale for the guide price of £250,000 pounds after it closed suddenly earlier this month.

However, the new owners will have to spend some time and hard work bringing the accommodation up to modern standards, with the hotel rooms not thought to have been used for over 20 years.

The pub was briefly renamed Tanya's Charms in honour of local resident Tanya Robinson, now Tanya Bardsley, who won the FHM High Street Honeys competition

The sale of the pub, which covers 9,200 square feet and dates back more than 100 years, comes as a flat in London's exclusive Knightsbridge has gone on the market for an eye watering £3 million.

 'We don't think the rooms have been used for 20 to 30 years and would need extensive renovation,' said Sam Frankland of estate agents CBRE.

'But we think it would make a great small hotel.'

The four-storey, grade II-listed building includes a large bar, kitchen, cellar, stores and upstairs function room.

The pub is owned by Stonegate Pub Company, which runs more than 600 venues across the UK.

The striking building was built by renowned Darlington architect George Gordon Hoskins in 1897.

Mr Hoskins also drew up the plans for Middlesbrough Town Hall and the Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, in Darlington, now Queen Elizabeth Sixth Form College.

The sale documents state that the property covers 9,200 square feet.

They add: 'A large detached Gothic revival Victorian former hotel of brick construction with bay windows to the front.

'The roof is multi-pitched slate extending over a former stable block at the rear with small enclosed yard. There is also a single storey flat roof infill to the rear.'

In 2003, the pub was briefly renamed Tanya's Charms in honour of local resident Tanya Robinson, now Tanya Bardsley, who won the FHM High Street Honeys competition.

The pub sign featuring a sheep was replaced with a picture of the model. 

When news of the pub's closure emerged last week, Richmond councillor Stuart Parsons expressed hope that the prominent building would be taken on by someone willing to invest in the property.
