Plans to build the first electric cars ever to be manufactured in Britian will create 2,000 new UK jobs, Prime Minster David Cameron announced today.

Production of the new Nissan LEAF at the Japanese car-giant’s record-breaking Sunderland factory was hailed as a huge boost to the UK economy.

Nissan and Downing Street said the £420million investment in the pollution-free car will support more than 2,000 jobs in the UK automotive industry - including more than 500 employed directly at Nissan which currently employs 6,100.

Until now the car has only been built in Japan and the USA.

But the new and improved second-generation LEAF - with a range of 123 miles and the ability to recharge in half the time.

The zero-emissions plug-in electric car is powered by advanced lithium-ion batteries manufactured in Nissan’s new UK Battery Plant and costs from around £20,000 including the £5,000 taxpayer subsidy.

This historic launch event comes as Nissan Sunderland Plant celebrates making more than seven million vehicles since its opening in 1986.

Last year alone it produced 510,572 vehicles and so became the first UK car factory ever to make more than half a million cars in one year.

David Cameron said plans to create the first electric cars in Britain will create 2,000 jobs in the UK

Ahead of his visit today (THURS) Mr Cameron said: ‘Nissan’s record breaking year last year is a success story for UK volume car manufacturing and demonstrates how our automotive industry is competing and thriving in the global race.

‘I warmly welcome the production of the new electric LEAF model and battery plant at Sunderland.

‘This £420 million investment, backed by Government, is supporting over 2,000 jobs in our automotive sector including more than 500 at Nissan in Sunderland, helping people in the area who want to work hard and get on.’

He said the Government had committed £400million to make the UK ‘a leading market for ultra low carbon vehicles.’

He added: ‘Nissan’s announcement shows the confidence the company has in the skills-base and the business environment in the UK and that the UK is open for business.’

Nissan’s executive vice president Andy Palmer said: ‘The Nissan LEAF is our most technically advanced car yet and the launch of this new model, built along with its batteries in Sunderland, is a huge boost not only for the plant but for British manufacturing.’

More than 55,000 first-generation Nissan LEAFs have been built.
