Beneath the arms and armour of a thousand years of monarchy, the former chief of the IRA’s Northern Command had dinner with the Sovereign at Windsor last night.

And he heard her declare firmly: ‘We are walking together towards a brighter, more settled, future. We shall remember our past but we will no longer allow our past to ensnare our future.’

On a day brimming with powerful symbolism in honour of the first state visit by a President of the Republic of Ireland, there were so many historic moments to choose from – President Michael D Higgins bowing at Westminster Abbey’s Tomb of the Unknown Warrior and addressing both Houses of Parliament; the Irish head of state being invited (in Irish) to inspect the Grenadier Guards.

But even the clattering pomp of a full state carriage procession through cheering Windsor streets festooned with the Irish tricolour could not match the significance of Martin McGuinness – in white tie and tails – rising to toast the Queen and the British people at last night’s state banquet.

Mr McGuinness and his Sinn Fein colleagues had got it badly wrong when they boycotted the Queen’s momentous state visit to the Republic in 2011.

On this reciprocal visit, he was determined not to misjudge the mood again.

So it was that Mr McGuinness found himself seated just 16 places down from the Prince of Wales – between scientist Sir Paul Nurse and Shami Chakrabarti of the pressure group, Liberty.

Shortly before taking his place, as the orchestra played a light Irish medley, he could be seen deep in conversation with both the British and Irish Prime Ministers.

There could hardly have been a more quintessentially British – or, indeed, English – setting.

St George’s Hall, built in homage to England’s patron saint by Edward III, boasts Britain’s longest table, a 168ft mahogany piece longer than an Olympic swimming pool.

Yesterday it was heaving with gold candelabra, flowers and more than 2,000 pieces of cutlery and linen. 

Every table setting (laid out with a ruler, 17 inches apart) included priceless Sevres china and Royal Brierley crystal.

A dinner of Scottish halibut and tournedos of Windsor beef was accompanied by a 2005 Meursault and a fine claret, Chateau Leoville-Barton 1990. 

For teetotallers such as Mr McGuinness, there was Sandringham apple juice and Malvern water.Continuing the theme of her visit three years ago, the Queen urged her 160 guests – an unusually celeb-packed collection including Sir Terry and Lady Wogan and actors Daniel Day-Lewis and Dame Judi Dench – to look to the future. 

This was no mean feat in a 14th-century chamber lined with a dozen suits of armour and the shields of every Knight of the Garter in history.

LEST WE FORGET

‘The goal of modern British-Irish relations can be simply stated,’ said the Queen. ‘It is that we, who inhabit these islands, should live together as neighbours and friends; respectful of each other’s nationhood, sovereignty and traditions; co-operating to our mutual benefit; at ease in each other’s company.’

Dressed in her Diamond Jubilee portrait gown, she had even ordered emerald green droplets to be inserted into the Grand Duchess Vladimir tiara in honour of her guests.

Just another subtle touch. So, too, was the harp playing Molly Malone as the royal procession came in to dinner.

In what must rank as one of her most significant speeches in recent years, the Queen even made direct reference to her most controversial guest: ‘Our two governments will continue to work together in Northern Ireland to support the First and Deputy First Minister.’

The latter is also a man whose comrades-in-arms murdered the Duke of Edinburgh’s uncle, Earl Mountbatten, along with thousands of innocents.

Yet the Queen first met Mr McGuinness during her Diamond Jubilee visit to Northern Ireland in 2012. 

Last night brought another introduction, away from the cameras, as all the guests were presented to the Queen, the Duke and Mr and Mrs Higgins on their way through to dinner. 

As protocol dictates, the Prince of Wales was not part of the greeting line (which involves only heads of state and their spouses) and so was not due to meet the former IRA capo.

Given the Prince’s closeness to Lord Mountbatten, this was probably a relief to both.

As ever the Queen was speaking on the advice of her ministers.

The only veiled hint of any personal loss came as she reflected on ‘so much chequered history, the avoidable and regrettable pain of which is still felt by many of us’.

The presence of Mr McGuinness was too much for some. Outside the castle, a small group of grieving families held up banners demanding justice for the victims of the IRA bombings in Omagh and Birmingham.

The protesters, however, conceded 
that the Queen had no option but to invite Mr McGuinness since that is 
what her Government had asked of her.

After all she has been obliged to entertain some 24-carat monsters in 
her time, not least the Ceausescus of Romania and the Mobutus of Zaire 
(who smuggled a dog in their luggage).

A
 key theme of this visit is the Irish contribution to British life. Last
 night, the Queen saluted all the Irish-born soldiers who gave their 
lives for king and country in the First World War. 

And
 she did not duck another unhappy relic of the past: ‘Many Irish 
migrants to Britain encountered discrimination and a lack of 
appreciation. Happily, those days are now behind us.’

There
 was humour, too. Harking back to the Olympics, the Queen drew warm 
laughter as she added: ‘It took someone of Irish descent – Danny Boyle –
 to get me to jump from a helicopter.’

In
 his response, President Higgins, a former arts minister who writes his 
own poetry, echoed the Queen’s sentiments. ‘Through conquest and 
resistance, we have cast shadows on each other, but we have also gained 
strength from one another as neighbours,’ he said.

This
 ‘joyous occasion’ would ‘celebrate the bonds of mutual understanding 
between our two peoples, and the warm, enduring friendship on which we 
have so happily embarked’.

Earlier, he had received the traditional honour of a carriage procession with a full escort from the Household Cavalry. Some Irish spectators wondered why the Queen and her guest were travelling in the Australian rather than the Irish State Coach. 

The Australian model, however, is the only one with heating. And Ireland was hardly under-represented.

Every single one of the 161 horses on parade is actually Irish. The Household Division buys all its chargers there.

After presenting the Irish Guards with a smart new coat for the enormous regimental mascot, Domhnall the wolfhound, Mr Higgins was ushered in to the castle for a private lunch and an intriguing exhibition of royal/Irish artefacts.

These included Queen Victoria’s own journals about her trips to Ireland and a book of poems which Oscar Wilde presented to the future Edward VII.

Much in evidence were the works of Irish-born George Bernard Shaw, including a fiery letter to the Spectator attacking the powers of censorship enjoyed (no longer) by the Monarch’s Lord Chamberlain.

The historic sights are far from over. Mr McGuinness will be back here tomorrow for a Northern Irish reception and another meeting with the Queen.

Later, he will join her at the Royal Albert Hall. It’s not so long ago that his old mob were trying to blow it up.

Still, that’s progress for you.
