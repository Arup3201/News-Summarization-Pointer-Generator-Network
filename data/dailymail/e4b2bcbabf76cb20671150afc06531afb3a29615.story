A huge rise in expectant mothers who are 'too posh to push' is costing millions and putting pressure on the health service, it has been warned

Around one in four women in the UK now has their baby by caesarean – putting enormous pressure on the NHS, doctors claim.

The rate has shot up to around 25 per cent in the last two decades, while in private hospitals it is around double that. In 1990 just 11 per cent of babies were delivered surgically.

Recent figures show one in three Caesarean sections carried out in the UK is requested by the mother, compared to one in 20 in 1990, Dr Geraldine O'Sullivan, lead clinician for obstetric anaesthesia, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, claims.

In private hospitals half of all Caesareans are carried out at the mother’s request.

Out of the 700,000 births that take place in the UK every year, between 25 and 30 per cent are Caesarean sections, almost double the 15 per cent recommended by the World Health Organisation, she added.

Each Caesarean costs the NHS £1,000 more than a regular delivery and a group of experts speaking at Euroanaesthesia, the annual congress of the European Society of Anaesthesiology (ESA), claim that even a small reduction in the number of babies delivered using the procedure will result in a large reduction in costs and free up medical specialists to help with emergency procedures.

Dr O'Sullivan voiced her concern for the added burden the increase is placing on an already stretched NHS.

‘The increased Caesarean section rate is putting anaesthesia, obstetric, and midwife teams under much greater strain at a time when there are increasingly reduced resources across healthcare systems,’ she said.

There is a greater risk of death for women who have to undergo emergency Caesarean sections, which account for two thirds of all Caesarean sections in the UK.

According to Dr O'Sullivan, reducing the number of planned Caesarean sections would allow doctors and nurses, especially anaesthesia specialists, to dedicate more of their time to women and their babies who are at risk of serious complications.

She said: ‘Women who require an emergency Caesarean section during labour, but who have already had an epidural catheter sited during the labour, are in a good position to receive emergency anaesthesia for caesarean section, since stronger drugs can be injected down the epidural.

‘The use of these drugs, which are essentially stronger solutions of the drugs used for pain relief in labour, means that the mother can be ready for her emergency surgery within 10-12 minutes of the anaesthetist being informed that emergency delivery is required.

Out of the 700,000 births that take place in the UK every year, between 25 and 30 per cent are Caesarean sections, almost double the 15 per cent recommended by the World Health Organisation

‘Other countries in Europe are 
experiencing similar issues to varying degrees and we need to ask why 
this is happening,’ said Dr O'Sullivan.

She explained: ‘Reasons could include better intra-partum fetal monitoring, fears of medico-legal claims, and, maternal demand.

‘Whatever the cause for the rise in the CS rate, it is likely that, in the near future, performance indicators will be devised for hospitals to help explain/evaluate that hospital's Caesarean section rate.

‘There is also a knock-on effect for future pregnancies, since once a woman has undergone one Caesarean section, she is then at greater risk of having an emergency CS in the next pregnancy, though in most cases she would demand another elective CS anyway.

‘Even for those women who have chosen vaginal birth following a previous caesarean section, around half will end up having a Caesarean section.’
