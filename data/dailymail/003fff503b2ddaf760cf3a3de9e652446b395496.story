Paris St Germain will NOT be able to appeal Zlatan Ibrahimovic's dismissal during Wednesday night's tempestuous Champions League clash with Chelsea.

The Sweden striker was given a straight red for a foul on Oscar in the first half of a 2-2 draw which sent the French side through to the last eight on away goals.

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho said Ibrahimovic had no ill intent and should be cleared to play in the quarter finals next month, while PSG manager Laurent Blanc said the club would discuss whether to lodge an appeal

However, Uefa have told Sportsmail that clubs can only appeal red cards if they believe the referee has mistaken the identity of the offender.

All red cards picked up in European competitions carry an automatic one-match ban which may be increased to three after a disciplinary panel reviews footage.

UEFA says the panel will study the case at its March 19 meeting.

If they decide to extend the ban, then PSG can launch an appeal against the additional matches but not the first.

In England, the situation is different. Clubs are allowed until the end of the next working day after the match in question to lodge an appeal against a decision regardless of whether the referee has identified the correct offender. They then have a further 24 hours to supply evidence.
