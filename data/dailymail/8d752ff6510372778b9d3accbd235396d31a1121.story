The stadium announcer cleared his throat, took a sharp intake of breath and giddily announced: ‘Welcome to the start of a new era at the home of the world’s greatest football club, the home of Manchester United.’

Moments later, the players arrived onto the field but all the eyes and smartphones skewed anxiously to catch a glimpse of the new manager, Louis van Gaal, who immersed himself to almost disappear amid the hustle and bustle.

There was no grand entrance, no banners draped over the Stretford End, no aeroplanes flying low over the Old Trafford skyline.

This was a quiet and confident entrance from Louis van Gaal. Suited up in United colours, he strode purposefully down the touchline carrying a folder, offering a regal wave to the supporters and flashing a wide grin to the cameras vying for his attention. Just another day at work for the 63-year-old who has managed European powerhouses Ajax, Barcelona and Bayern Munich.

Afterwards, he allowed himself to indulge a little, lauding his first evening at Old Trafford as a ‘fantastic’ experience and smiling when this last-gasp win was compared to the Sir Alex Ferguson victories of yesteryear.

Before the match, it was business as usual. As is habit for Van Gaal, he wandered out to observe his players pre-match warm-up, focusing the minds on the challenge ahead.

As he shuffled across the Old Trafford pitch to take pride of place in front of the Sir Alex Ferguson stands, Thin Lizzy’s 1976 classic The Boys are back in town echoed out out the speakers, the air-horns sounded and Old Trafford bellowed its approval.

It feels an age since since this famous old stadium has felt such a contented place. As the players performed their stretches and shuttle-rins, the warm ovation was born out of affection, rather than anxiety, as was so often the case during those fraught days under David Moyes last season.

When the players walked back into the dressing room, Van Gaal followed behind, waving either arm in the air and giving a high-five to Fred the Red as he entered the tunnel. It was that sort of night at Old Traford.

As the action began, Van Gaal reclined into that red leather chair, worn-in for so many years by Ferguson and vacated after just 10 months by Moyes.

Moyes, in truth, could never really sit still, taking sanctuary on the touchline and gesticulating furiously to his players. That, to be fair, is his style of management but there is no question that United players welcome a return to the Sir Alex model, offering trust to the players and stern rebukes only when necessary.

Van Gaal barely ventured to the dugout, instead scribbling notes on his pad, ready to correct United’s faults in the more tranquil surroundings of the dressing room.

In the stands, a host of United players watched on, dressed immaculately in club suits. Nicky Butt, the Under 21 coach, accompanied injured players Luke Shaw, Jonny Evans, Danny Welbeck and Michael Carrick in the directors box, along with those overlooked such as Nani and Will Keane. Robin van Persie remains a little short of fitness and he sat close to young James Wilson, invited to be a part of the senior group after four goals in the Manchester Senior Cup final against Manchester City last week.

When they went to depart before the half-time whistle, they moved as a group, uniformed and orderly, clearly on the instructions of Van Gaal.

This friendly game had been branded as REUNITED by the United marketing department in the days leading and after the fractious outpourings of the past 12 months, it seemed rather fitting.

Slowly but surely, Van Gaal is knitting this club back together once more.
