Hoards of eager crowds have gathered in Afghanistan's capital to watch competitors face off in the country's brutal and bizarre national sport that was previously banned under Taliban regime.

The fierce competition involves mounted players who drag a disembowelled and decapitated goat and throw it into a scoring circle.

Buzkashi translates into 'goat pulling' in English, but a calf is sometimes used too as the flesh is more likely to withhold the constant pulling and tugging by the athletes.

Very little is known about buzkashi in the rest of the world, but it gained popularity when it was featured in the Rambo film franchise

The goat carcass, which can weigh up to 160 pounds, can be soaked in water prior to the event to toughen it

Although rules can vary, the matches usually see horsemen aim to fight off other players to transport the animal into a circle drawn onto the ground.

In contests in Kabul, referees oversee the game proceedings, played on a square layout measuring 1,300ft on each side.

The history of the game is unknown but can be traced back to medieval nomadic tribes.
