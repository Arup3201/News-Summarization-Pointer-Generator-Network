A Pennsylvania man who shot dead a couple who invaded his home and killed his wife and son, only learned when being questioned by police that the woman he killed in self-defense was his estranged daughter

Josephine and Jeff Ruckinger, both 43, shot and killed her mother, 64-year-old Roberta Frew, and brother, 47-year-old John Frew Jr, before being shot and killed themselves by her father John Frew late last Friday.

According to police, the Ruckingers knocked on her family's door at about 10pm after the family returned from dinner and was settling to watch TV.

Unrecognizable: A man in Pennsylvania unknowingly shot and killed his estranged daughter when she and her husband invaded his home - killing his wife and son

Her mother answered the door and quickly yelled 'Oh my God, they have guns' before she was shot by her daughter wielding a sawed-off shot gun.

The couple proceeded into the house and continued to shoot her older brother.

When she turned her gun to her father it was too late. He had retrieved a .22-caliber pistol after hearing the commotion and shot her in the head.

When her husband tried to retaliate, he shot him as well.

By the time police arrived, Mrs Frew, John Frew Jr and Jeff Ruckinger were already dead.

Josephine was still alive with a gunshot wound to the head, but died later at the hospital.

It was only when Mr Frew was being questioned by police that he was informed that it was his daughter Josephine that he killed. He hadn't recognized her.

The two had been estranged for years, and a family member says Josephine nursed a grudge for her family.

Josephine had 'a hatred toward the family' according to her aunt Virginia Cruse, who spoke with the Lewistown Sentinel.

Cruse said the daughter and mother did not get along, but that she had no idea what spawned Friday's tragedy.

When Josephine was about 20, she and a boyfriend trashed her parents' home and stole items including a pistol, then fled to Pittsburgh, Cruse said. After that, she said, 'more or less, they disowned her.

Jeff Ruckinger worked for a tire repair company and Josephine had disabilities that prevented her from working, Cruse said.
