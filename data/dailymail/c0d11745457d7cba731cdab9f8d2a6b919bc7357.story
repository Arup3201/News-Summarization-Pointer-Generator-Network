West Ham midfielder Alex Song has insisted he turned down offers of Champions League football in order to return to the Premier League with the Hammers.

Clubs throughout Europe were put on alert when it emerged Song would be allowed to leave Barcelona.

Instead of playing in the prestigious Champions League with the likes of Galatasaray courting his transfer, West Ham won the race to take him to Upton Park on a temporary basis.

Song is evidently delighted to return to the Premier League this season: 'I'm very happy to be here, to start to do my job for West Ham United, and I’m very proud to be part of the project at this club.’

‘I think this is very important for me to be coming back to London to West Ham United, which is a club with ambition to build a new stadium and become a big club. I am very excited to be part of this project.’

The 26-year-old Cameroon international struggled to hold down a regular place at the Nou Camp following a move from Arsenal in 2012, where he spent seven seasons:

'For me, when I was in Spain, I always said that if I was to leave one day I would return to the Premier League.

‘It was a very hard decision, because when you have options of a lot of clubs who are playing in the Champions League, but at the end of the day I chose West Ham because I wanted to come to the Premier League.

‘This is a league which has given me a lot and I didn't finish what I wanted to achieve here.

The midfielder, who can also fill in at centre-back, revealed that Hammers boss Sam Allardyce convinced him of West Ham’s ambition to rise to the next level:

‘When I spoke to the manager, he gave me very good advice,’ said Song.

‘I had a very good chat with him and that's why I am coming here. We have to do better than last season. I think the club has very good ambition and I hope we can maybe catch the European positions, because that would be very good for the club.

‘I want to be part of that and that's why I came here. The manager knows what he wants and I know what he wants and that's why I want to help the team.

‘I need some games to be ready and get my fitness back. When I am 100 per cent, I will bring the experience and I will make the fans happy, I am sure. I am lucky to be back in London, back in England and with West Ham. I am looking forward to showing everyone what I can do.'

Song is West Ham's eighth summer capture, following the arrivals of Mauro Zarate, Cheikhou Kouyate, Enner Valencia, Diafra Sakho, Carl Jenkinson, Aaron Cresswell and Diego Poyet.
