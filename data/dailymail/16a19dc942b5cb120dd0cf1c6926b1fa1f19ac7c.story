A woman who tortured her teenage brother to death after accusing him  of witchcraft was jailed for life yesterday.

Magalie Bamu and her boyfriend Eric Bikubi inflicted more than 130 injuries on  15-year-old Kristy Bamu over the course of a horrific four-day attack.

Bamu, 29, a former Marks & Spencer worker, was told she will spend at least 25 years behind bars for the barbaric killing. Her boyfriend, 28, a former football coach, was jailed for at least 30 years after a jury heard that he had caused the teenager the most suffering.

Sentencing the Congolese pair at the 
Old Bailey, Judge David Paget QC said Bamu must have realised her 
sibling was going to die in an attack that ‘surpassed belief’.

He added: ‘I am aware of the 
controversy of the meaning of the word sadistic in this context. I am in
 no doubt this murder involved a sadistic element. The intention was to 
rid Kristy Bamu of witchcraft.

‘To do that both of you brutalised and physically abused him until eventually he died. It was prolonged torture.

‘A belief in witchcraft, however genuine, can never excuse an assault on another person or the killing of another human being.

‘I find it impossible not to  conclude
 that there was an  intention by you, Eric Bikubi, to kill, perhaps not 
at first but certainly at the end of the ordeal inflicted on Kristy.

In court: Kelly Bamu, pictured on the witness stand, said Kristy asked for forgiveness. 'He asked again and again,' she said, adding 'Magalie did absolutely nothing. She didn't give a damn'

‘You, Magalie Bamu, must have realised
 that might happen, why else say to your mother: “If you do not collect 
the children, Eric would kill Kristy”.’

After the convictions, Kristy’s father
 Pierre said: ‘Kristy was a delightful child with a promising future – 
we will miss him terribly.

‘The fact Kristy died at the hands of 
those who were expected to look after him and his siblings during their 
visit to London, makes it all the more difficult for us to come to terms
 with.’

Detective Superintendent Terry Sharpe,
 of the Metropolitan Police, warned that crimes linked with  witchcraft 
remained ‘hidden and under-reported’.

Violent evidence: Kristy Bamu suffered 130 injuries after being tortured for four days with weapons including broken ceramic floor tiles

Witchcraft: These weapons were found at the scene in what officers called an 'unprecedented scenario'

Evidence: Officers found a whole array of weapons in the flat, including pliers, a pole, and a piece of wood

Terrible death: Kristy's last words were 'I just want to die now' before he slipped underneath the water in the bath

He added: ‘It is difficult to see how 
the verdicts will bring much comfort to the Bamu family but I do hope 
that it will allow them to move on with their lives.’

The court previously heard that Bamu and Bikubi, like many Congolese nationals, were obsessed with kindoki, or witchcraft.

The couple accused Kristy of trying to
 bewitch a child in the family  after he arrived from Paris for  
Christmas 2010 with four of his siblings at their council flat in 
Newham, East London.

The pair beat him with a metal 
weightlifting pole, a curtain rod and a wooden plank, knocked out his 
teeth with a hammer and smashed heavy floor tiles over his head.

Meanwhile his siblings, aged between 
11 and 22, were forced to fast and pray throughout the night and at some
 points goaded to join in and clear up the pools of blood.

Kristy drowned in the bath on Christmas Day after begging to die as Bikubi hosed him down to ‘cleanse’ him of evil spirits.

The sentences mark the end of a court 
case that has sparked calls for police to do more to tackle crimes 
fuelled by such medieval beliefs.

There have been at least 83 cases of children attacked in London for ‘sorcery’ over the past decade.

Shocking: This was the squalid and bloodstained scene police were confronted by when they discovered the killing of Kristy Bamu by his sister and her partner in Newham, east London

Scene of the crime: Kristy was forced to pray for deliverance for four days and deprived of food and water

Christian fundamentalist pastors in Britain are fuelling the belief in witchcraft, experts have warned.

Dr Richard Hoskins, a police adviser, said he has spoken to many immigrant Londoners gripped by the potential power of malicious ‘spirits’ threatening to damage their families.

Traditional methods of exorcism include wearing a charm, fasting or sacrificing an animal and are controlled by the Church.

The university lecturer warned that Christian extremists and evangelists have begun taking advantage of vulnerable families and perpetuating beliefs in witchcraft by offering expensive ‘deliverance services’.

Dr Hoskins said: ‘What seems to happen is that there is this dislocation and, in this case, something feral and wild. It is completely out of control.’

The issue was first highlighted by the case of eight-year-old Victoria Climbie in 2000. Victoria, who travelled to Britain from the Ivory Coast, died at the hands of her aunt and her boyfriend after being branded a witch.

A year later the torso of a Nigerian boy, named Adam by police, was found in the Thames after he was ritually sacrificed. 

Police believe he may have been killed by someone with a terminal illness who believed his murder would save them.

In 2005, three people were convicted of beating, cutting and rubbing chilli peppers in the eyes of an eight-year-old Angolan girl to ‘beat the devil out of her’.
