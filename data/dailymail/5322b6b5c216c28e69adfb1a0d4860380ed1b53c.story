A high school gym teacher in Queens has been arrested for the second time in three days, after being accused of having a sexual relationship with a second student on the rebound after falling out with her first student lover over his prom date.

Joy Morsi, a 39-year-old teacher at Grover Cleveland High School in Queens, New York, was taken into custody on Wednesday morning on the latest charge just hours after she had pleaded not guilty to raping a student when he was 16.

Prosecutors say she hooked up with the second 16-year-old student on Saturday morning shortly after her relationship with the student wrestler fell apart because he asked a girl to prom.

'Two weeks
 after the alleged relationship with that student ended, she enticed a 
student and engaged in sexual activity with this 16-year-old again on 
school property just over this past weekend,' said prosecutor Melissa 
Kelly.

Prosecutors cited text messages as evidence of the sexual encounter.

Morsi was charged with two-counts of third-degree criminal sexual act and one-count of endangering the welfare of a child.

She was ordered held on an additional $25,000 bail and has to return to court on June 23, reports ABC7.

‘These are serious accusations in which a school teacher - who should serve as a role model to students - is instead accused of using her position to gain access to children for her own gratification,’ said Queens District Attorney Richard Brown.

Morsi cannot be
 fired or stripped of her pay without due process, officials said. The 
second student told authorities that he had sex twice with the teacher 
in the school on Saturday.

On Tuesday Morsi had been charged with 
third-degree rape and third-degree criminal sex act after being accused 
of a year-long sexual affair with a 16-year-old student wrestler.

Morsi is alleged to have sent the wrestler raunchy selfies and emails. Their affair was only exposed after she flew into a jealous rage because he was taking another girl to prom.

The Long Island mother, whose husband Hany Morsi, also teaches at the school, was first arrested on Monday.

The illegal relationship with the wrestler began last June when Morsi offered to help the student lose weight, prosecutors said in court.

On June 10, Morsi allegedly lured the unidentified student into a 'secluded closet' where she exposed herself to him.

She also allegedly sent the student emails asking if he was a virgin, along with saucy text messages. The
 court heard the pair had sex all over the school from June to July last
 year, and continued to meet for sex outside of school.

Authorities were apparently tipped off after one of the victim's female friends told her parents.

That girl's mother, who also works in the school system, informed another education department employee.

In court on Tuesday, Morsi pleaded not guilty to numerous counts of third-degree rape, a criminal sexual act in the third degree and one count of endangering the welfare of a child. The stone-faced teacher did not comment after being ordered held on $25,000 bail.

As the student turned 17 during the nearly year-long dalliance, subsequent alleged encounters are considered legal.

Morsi, described by some students as 'a hard-working teacher' did not comment as she left court. If convicted, she faces four years behind bars.

City Department of Education officials said Morsi was 'immediately removed' from the classroom when she was reported.

'We find these claims disturbing and reprehensible and she will remain reassigned - far from any student and the school - pending a criminal investigation,' deputy press secretary Marcus Liem said.

'We will work closely with the school to ensure they are given any needed support.'

Morsi, who has four children, had nothing to say as she left court on Tuesday, but attorney, Virginia Lopreto, signaled she would fight the case.

'My client’s ties to the community have been verified,' Lopreto said. 'Her husband is here. She has a family and children. She’s very likely to see this through.'

Morsi started working as a gym teacher in 1999, has a clean discipline record and earns $79,531 a year, according to records.

Meanwhile students at the school said rumors had long circulated about the alleged affair.

'We had a feeling that something was going on,' ninth-grader Josie Gonzalez told New York Daily News. 'They would always be together around the school.'
