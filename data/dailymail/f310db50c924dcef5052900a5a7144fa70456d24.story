At least 22 immigrants have drowned after two dangerously overfilled boats sank off of the coast of a Greek island last night.

Four children and 18 adults were found either dead in the water or crammed into the cabin of a yacht, which overturned along with a dinghy off the coast of Samos.

More than 30 survivors were also pulled from the Aegean sea by the Greek coastguard. Though the nationalities of the dead are unclear, the survivors included Somalis, Syrians and Eritreans.

The authorities, who dragged the overturned yacht back to shore today, could not immediately say why it had capsized.

Officials 
said 36 people - 32 men, three women and a child - were rescued, and the
 child was airlifted to a hospital on the mainland in critical 
condition. Survivors included 23 Somalis, nine Syrians and three 
Eritreans, the coast guard said. The child's nationality and the 
nationalities of those who died are unclear.

Coast
 guard officials recovered the bodies of two women, a man and a boy from
 the sea, and later found a further 18 bodies - including three children
 - inside the yacht after it was towed to Samos.

Survivors
 told the coast guard between 60 and 65 people had been on the 10-meter 
(30-foot) yacht and the two-meter (six-foot) dinghy that had set off 
from Turkey.

'We can't give a precise number of missing people with any certainty,' a coast guard spokesman said.

Coast
 guard vessels, fishing boats and two search and rescue helicopters were
 combing the area for survivors or bodies. A nearby cruise ship helped 
for several hours in the morning before being cleared to continue its 
journey.

Rescue efforts: 36 survivors were found in the Aegean Sea as well as the 22 who died

Escape: The passengers, thought to have been trying to enter the EU, including Somalis, Eritreans and Syrians

In recent years Samos has become a hotspot for smugglers and people traffickers because it is close to the Turkish coast.

Rescue teams led a search for up to seven more people missing, in what was one of the deadliest migrant boat accidents in Greek waters in recent years and the third fatal one this year.

The vessels overturned before dawn off the island of Samos, a favorite destination for migrant-smuggling gangs because it's close to the Turkish coast. The Greek coast guard said it was not immediately clear what caused the overloaded craft to capsize.

Greece's merchant marine minister, Miltiadis Varvitsiotis, said he was 'devastated' by the incident, adding that the government would press other European Union members to draw up a joint plan to fight migrant smugglers more effectively.

'Modern-day slave traders are making a fortune by place placing thousands of people's lives at risk, putting them on small and unsuitable boats at night in the Aegean,' he said.

Fatal accidents are frequent as migrants risk the dangerous sea crossing from Turkey.

'It is vital to understand what it is that routinely brings thousands of migrants to trust smugglers, face exorbitant costs, and risk their lives on unseaworthy vessels,' said migration expert Maurizio Albahari, an assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Notre Dame.

'It's quite simple. It is legally impossible for them to travel safely on planes and ferries. But they risk... many dangers to escape despair, and are prepared to die in order to set off with new hope,' he said, adding that policymakers could consider off-shore asylum applications and a transnational coast guard effort to help prevent such deaths.

Officials said 36 people - 32 men, three women and a child - were rescued, and the child was airlifted to a hospital on the mainland in critical condition. Survivors included 23 Somalis, nine Syrians and three Eritreans, the coast guard said. The child's nationality and the nationalities of those who died are unclear.

Coast guard officials recovered the bodies of two women, a man and a boy from the sea, and later found a further 18 bodies - including three children - inside the yacht after it was towed to Samos.

Survivors told the coast guard between 60 and 65 people had been on the 10-meter (30-foot) yacht and the two-meter (six-foot) dinghy that had set off from Turkey.

'We can't give a precise number of missing people with any certainty,' coast guard spokesman Nikos Lagadianos said.

Coast guard vessels, fishing boats and two search and rescue helicopters were combing the area for survivors or bodies. A nearby cruise ship helped for several hours in the morning before being cleared to continue its journey.

Before Monday, 21 people had drowned in similar incidents since the beginning of the year. At least 21 people died, and six are still missing, after a similar accident in December 2012. Over the weekend, the Greek coast guard rescued about 250 immigrants from the sea.
