A Florida prosecutor today tore into Casey Anthony’s brother in court, appearing to suggest that he was putting on a display of emotion and giving inconsistent testimony to help his sister's defence.

Lee Anthony - who since his niece’s death in 2008 had refused to meet with lawyers on either side of the case to discuss evidence - admitted that he 'reached out' to the defence earlier this week to offer 'information..,that I thought was important', angering state attorneys as they challenged him on conflicts in his testimony.

The prosecution’s expressions of cynicism over Mr Anthony’s reliability came a day after his mother Cindy also dropped a bombshell when she testified that it was her, not her daughter, who researched chloroform on the family computer in March 2008.

Break down: Lee Anthony testifies in the murder case of his sister Casey Anthony, saying he wasn't told about his sister's pregnancy until just before his niece Caylee was born

Her revelation, which was at partial 
odds with a deposition she gave in 2009, damaged the state’s assertion 
that Casey Anthony, 25, plotted in advance to overpower her two-year-old
daughter Caylee with chloroform before suffocating her.

Giving evidence at the trial in 
Orlando, Florida, Mr Anthony broke down as he testified about how his 
sister’s pregnancy had been kept secret from him in 2005.

His evidence was introduced by the 
defence to bolster their claim that the Anthonys were a dysfunctional 
family with 'dark secrets' who hid their daughter’s pregnancy out of 
shame and raised her to lie.

Despite it being 'brutally obvious' 
that his sister was pregnant in summer 2005, he claimed that his sister 
'waved off' his enquiries and that his mother also avoided discussing it
when he asked.

As a result, he did not visit his sister in hospital after she gave birth, he said.

'I was a little hurt, just didn’t 
want to be there,' he testified, crying as he spoke. His sister also 
looked distressed, weeping in court.

During the emotional day in court Casey Anthony wiped away tears from her eyes while her brother Lee Anthony testified

Reaction: Casey also teared up while mother Cindy Anthony testify today

Also during Mr Anthony's testimony, Cindy began to cry and had to leave the court room with her husband.

Mr Anthony continued: 'I was very 
angry at my mom and I was also angry at my sister. I was just angry at 
everyone in general that they didn’t want to include me and didn’t find 
it important enough to tell me, especially after I had asked.'

But under cross-examination, he ceded
that his court testimony was at odds with a deposition given in 2009. 
In his deposition, he stated that he had never directly challenged his 
sister about her pregnancy and that far from trying to sweep the pending
birth under the carpet, his mother and father had gone 'over the top' 
to prepare for their grand-daughter’s arrival, buying a crib, taking 
their daughter shopping for baby items,  turning their spare room into a
nursery with a Winnie the Pooh theme, and organizing a baby shower.

Prosecutor Jeff Ashton pointed out that Mr Anthony had not wept when asked the same questions in 2009 about his niece’s birth.

'What was different two hours ago in 
this courtroom that question that caused such raw emotion which wasn’t 
present two years ago when you were asked the same thing?' Mr Ashton 
demanded roughly.

Mr Anthony replied: 'Two years ago, I
did not 100 percent hold the belief that Caylee was dead…during that 
two-year span I have come to the place that I believe she is.'

He added later: 'I don’t want to be 
here. I don’t want my sister to be here and my parents to be here…This 
is obviously just very very emotionally draining.'

The video of Caylee showed how she was capable of climbing the ladder and getting into the pool with almost no help from her grandmother, who cried as she watched the video play in court

Casey Anthony has pleaded not guilty 
to first-degree murder, aggravated manslaughter of a child, aggravated 
child abuse and four counts of lying to law enforcement. She potentially
faces the death penalty if convicted.

When Caylee first went missing in 
June 2008, Anthony told her mother that the child was with a nanny. A 
month later, when her mother called in sheriff’s deputies, Anthony 
claimed that the nanny had kidnapped the child.

During opening statements in her 
trial, her story changed again as her lawyer claimed that Caylee drowned
accidentally in the family pool, that her grandfather George Anthony 
disposed of the body, and that Casey went along with the cover-up 
because she had been molested by her father as a child and 'raised to 
lie.' George Anthony has denied the allegations.

Photographs presented in court by the
defence today showed Caylee climbing up a ladder into her grandparents’
above-ground swimming pool, supported by her grandmother, illustrating 
that she was capable of getting in on her own.

Cindy Anthony testified that Caylee was able to open a sliding 
glass door that led to the backyard pool.

Cindy Anthony cried again as she testified for the second day in a row for the defense in the murder trial of her daughter

Stress: George Anthony listens as his wife Cindy Anthony testifies

'Even at that point, she could even climb into the pool' Cindy said when shown a photo.

Casey Anthony wiped away tears while a video of her playing with the girl was viewed by the jury during her mother's testimony.

Mrs Anthony testified that the ladder
would always be removed after they had swum together. But on June 16, 
2008, the day the defence now claims that Caylee was found dead in the 
pool, the ladder was mysteriously back in position, she stated, 
confirming evidence introduced by detectives earlier in the trial.

The
new revelations follow a dramatic day in court yesterday, where Cindy 
Anthony admitted making internet searches about chloroform on a family 
computer - directly contradicting prosecutors' theory that it was Casey 
who made the queries.

During a terse courtroom exchange, 
Judge Belvin Perry poured scorn on Anthony’s lawyer, Jose Baez, for 
attempting to quiz Cindy Anthony about 'marital difficulties', Judge 
Perry cut him short, telling him that her relationship with her husband 
was irrelevant to the case.

'If your theory of defence is 
ever-changing, maybe you just need to tell me what your theory of 
defence is. At least, somebody try to explain it to me,' the judge told 
Mr Baez cynically.

Among the spectators in court today 
was Judge Stan Strickland, who was originally assigned to the Anthony 
case in 2008 but withdrew nearly two years later amid hostilities with 
Mr Baez.

Judge Strickland – who during a bond 
hearing in July 2008 remarked that 'The truth and Ms Anthony are 
strangers,'- recused himself in April 2010 after Mr Baez filed a motion 
accusing him of being a 'self-aggrandising media hound' who was biased 
against his client.

In a fiery parting statement to the 
court in 2010, Judge Strickland accused Mr Baez of being the one trying 
to court public attention, noting sarcastically: 'The recusal motion 
accuses the undersigned of being a ‘self-aggrandising media hound.’ 
Indeed. The irony is rich.'

The trial continues.
