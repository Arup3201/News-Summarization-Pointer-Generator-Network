It has been the first port of call for aristocrats seeking reliable domestic staff for more than 125 years.

The Prince of Wales and the Queen Mother are both believed to have recruited servants via the classified adverts section of The Lady.

Less successful was the Duchess of York who once advertised for a dresser in Britain’s oldest lady’s weekly and appointed Jane Andrews, who was later jailed for murdering her boyfriend Tom Cressman.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, pictured above with Prince George and their spaniel Lupo,  have placed a classified advert in The Lady for a housekeeper at their country home.

The housekeeper will be based as the couple's Norfolk home Anmer Hall and the advert states that 'discretion and loyalty' will be paramount for the successful applicant

Now it seems that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have resorted to placing an advert for a new housekeeper at their country home, Anmer Hall, in the pages of the illustrious magazine.

According to well-placed sources, the notice that appeared on the magazine’s online home page yesterday - and will today appear in print - seeking an ‘experienced housekeeper for a large family home in Norfolk’ is for the latest addition to William and Kate’s expanding domestic staff.

The advert, which would have cost around £575 plus VAT to place, makes clear that they are looking for someone who is well versed in dealing with young children – as well as Prince George, who will turn two in July, the couple’s second baby is due later next month – and their excitable spaniel, Lupo.

It reads: ‘Housekeeper sought for a large family home in Norfolk. We are looking for someone with previous housekeeping experience, ideally within a large private house, and preferably within a family environment with dogs.’

It says the successful applicant’s main duties will include: ‘cleaning all areas of the house to a high standard; caring for and maintaining the home owners’ clothing; cleaning silverware and glassware; purchasing groceries and general provisions for the house; and dealing with deliveries; assisting with childcare and caring for dogs.’

Unsurprisingly, the Cambridges are looking for someone who can fit into a royal household.

‘Discretion and loyalty is paramount,’ the advert reads, in addition to a valid UK driving licence.

The new housekeeper will be required to work Monday to Friday, but must be flexible about working during the weekends.

Intrudingly the annual salary on offer is not listed and applicants are invited to write in their ‘salary expectations’.

It adds: ‘Self-contained accommodation will be provided (suitable for a couple). The partner may be offered ad hoc maintenance work, although there is no guaranteed work provided for them.’

Closing date for applications is Sunday April 5.

The couple appear to have had some trouble in finding the right person to oversee their new ten-bedroom home on the Queen’s Sandringham estate and was given to them by the monarch as a wedding present.

William and Kate have spent a small fortune renovating the Georgian pile to their exact taste – including the building of a new garden room with a glass ceiling so they can dine under the stars. The house already has its own swimming pool, tennis court and extensive grounds.

They had employed two of the Queen’s trusted employees, Amy Wood and her husband, Colin, to work at the mansion as housekeeper and gardener.

They lived in a cottage in the grounds of the house with their five-year-old son.

But earlier this month it emerged they had unexpectedly quit after less than five months to return to work for the Queen at Sandringham house, just two miles away.

No reason has emerged for the move but it shocked locals who said: ‘It is the talk of the estate that they should be giving up their prestige jobs after such a short time. They appeared happy working there.’

The royal couple have been desperate to find a replacement as soon as possible as they plan to move to Norfolk full-time after their baby is born next month, coinciding with William’s new job as a pilot with East Anglia Air Ambulance.

Now it seems they are placing their faith in The Lady.

A spokesman for the magazine, first published in 1885, said yesterday: ‘I can't comment on any individual advertisement, but The Lady has been putting households and the very best domestic staff in touch for 130 years.

‘Princes use The Lady, paupers use The Lady, they've even used The Lady in Downton Abbey. I wouldn't be the slightest bit surprised if Mary Poppins herself called to place an ad.’

Kensington Palace declined to comment.
