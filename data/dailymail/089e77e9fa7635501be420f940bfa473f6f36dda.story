Tony Pulis was locked in a crisis meeting with Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish on Thursday night in a row over the club’s transfer policy.

Pulis, who kept Palace in the Barclays Premier League last season after taking over when they had just four points, threatened to quit.

Although the Palace chief took training as usual on Thursday as he prepared for Saturday's opening fixture with Arsenal, Parish called him into a meeting at a central London location.

The pair’s relationship has deteriorated again over the summer over a difference of opinion in the type of players they want to recruit at Selhurst Park.

Pulis took over at Palace last season when the club had just four points, but they staged a remarkable recovery in the second phase of the season to finish 11th.

The former Stoke manager wanted to be backed heavily in the summer transfer window, but Parish has a cautious approach because of the finance involved.

Palace have twice gone into administration under different owners because of a catastrophic transfer policy under former chairman Mark Goldberg and, more recently, under Simon Jordan.

Parish, who is one of four Palace fans who own a 25 per cent share each in the club, does not want to overstretch the budget.

Pulis is convinced he needs new players, but he has become increasingly frustrated over the summer by the failure to land any of his main targets.

He believed he had put together deals for Steven Caulker, Michu and Gylfi Sigurdsson when the season came to an end.

Instead Caulker signed for QPR, Michu joined Rafa Benitez at Napoli and Sigurdsson returned to Swansea from Tottenham.

Pulis wants total control of the club’s recruitment policy, but Parish is reluctant to let the manager be in sole charge of player trading.
