Apps and social media are causing a 'digital shift' and changing the way that people worship, new research has revealed. 

Christian scripture app Bible, from YouVersion, recently surpassed 100 million downloads in the App Store, placing it on equal grounds with Facebook, Twitter and Instagram in number of users.

As more religions embrace digitization, there are now apps available including iQuran, iTorah and Book of Mormon, Mashable reports.

Digital shift: Religious leaders and congregations are using digital technology to change the way they worship

There is also a Buddhist Meditation Trainer, and JewGlass to translate Hebrew and find synagogues.

In mid-May, the Vatican unveiled Missio, the just-for-Catholics app that updates users with homilies, videos and
other related news — sometimes directly from Pope Francis' Twitter account.

Religious leaders are trying to find ways to merge age-old traditions with 21st century technology.

For Bible app found Bobby
Gruenewald, today's digital worship is comparable to the advent of the printing 
press, a technology which transformed centuries-worth of Biblical 
education. 

Mr Gruenewald founded the Bible app in 2008 as a digital substitute for a paper Bible, with added interactivity.

Users can view more than 600 versions of the text, in close to 400 
languages, and he says parishioners trade
more than 200,000 quotes each day across various social platforms.

Inspirational technology: Since launching in 2008, the Bible app has gained over 100 million users

Amir Ahmed Nas, author of The Future of Islam in the Age of New Media, compares the digitization of relition to upgrading from Windows 95 to Windows Vista.

He points out that Islamic scholars have 
maintained relative control over the production and interpretation of sacred texts - but now Muslims have 'newfound freedoms' to spread ideas through the technology.  

Mr Ahmed is also aware of the downsides, such as more radical users spreading hate.

'[There are] a lot of stupid 
people — even a few dangerous ones who preach radicalizing messages of 
hate and intolerance,'  he says.

But most spiritual leaders seem to have made peace with the technology - even, at times, when it comes to using cell phones in church.

Pastor Andy Wood of South Bay Church 
in Silicon Valley, Calif. says it's now totally normal to see members of
the congregation whipping out their smartphones to live-tweet during 
services.

'A lot of churches — and let's face it, religions in general — tend 
to resist ways of culture rather than embrace it,' he says.

'If you look
at what's current, then capitalize on it, it makes things so much 
easier.'
