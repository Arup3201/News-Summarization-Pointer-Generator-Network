The Coalition is in conflict over a critical report on wind farms that could prove they damage rural areas, it emerged today.

Liberal Democrat ministers have been accused of trying to suppress a document commissioned by a Tory minister because it concentrates on 'ideology' not science, sources have said.

Ed Davey, the Lib Dem Energy and Climate Change Secretary, is believed to be concerned at the report ordered by Tory Environment Secretary Owen Paterson – an outspoken critic of the green energy source.

Mr Paterson described wind farms as a 
‘complete scam’ in June and is said to be furious at attempts to hold 
back his report.

According to the Daily Telegraph a source said: ‘They don’t want information out there that would allow people to challenge the energy solution they are going after.’

Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs officials are said to have wanted ‘hard and fast evidence’ about the impact renewables would have on rural communities.

However, the Department of Energy and Climate Change confirmed the departments were ‘working together’ on the report and that it was still unfinished.

A spokesman said: ‘We are currently working with Defra to ensure that a final report meets the usual standards and quality assurances that you would expect from any Government publication.’

The Mail understands that the report was a joint project between both departments.

A DECC source denied that ministers in the department were attempting to block it. ‘There has been some toing and froing, but there is no attempt to block any report.’

The source added: ‘Ed has always been open-minded about fracking and other energy sources, not just renewables. We need a mix of energy in order to keep bills down.’

A similar row over wind farms erupted last year between Mr Davey and Tory colleague John Hayes.

Mr Hayes has now been moved from the department.
