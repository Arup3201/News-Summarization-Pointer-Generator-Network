Pranging your boyfriend's car is always going to cause a bit of tension in a relationship. But when your beau is a successful Nascar driver and you've sent his vehicle spinning across the track, it's just that bit more awkward.

So  Danica Patrick will no doubt have some making up to do after she was involved in an on-track incident with fellow driver - and boyfriend - Ricky Stenhouse Jr. in the closing laps of Sunday's NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race.

Patrick was running 18th with 10 laps to go in the opening race at Chicagoland Speedway in Joliet, Illinois, when she made contact with Stenhouse's car.

Ricky Stenhouse spun across the track and received left front damage to his race car. Danica Patrick hit the outside retaining wall, suffering damage to the right front end of her vehicle

Her car turned and hit the outside retaining wall, suffering damage to its right front end. Meanwhile, Stenhouse spun across the track and received left front damage to his race car.

Patrick, who has been dating Stenhouse for the past two years, radioed her crew with the words: 'The 17 hit me'

She then made it back to the pits and received brief repairs by her crew, before heading back to the racetrack to finish 19th.

Patrick, 32, is well-known both on and off the racetrack. As well as being the first woman to race full-time on Nascar’s senior circuit in 36 years, the race car driver - who now lives in Phoenix, Arizona - has graced the cover of a number of magazines, including Sports Illustrated.

'I heard my spotter (Brandon Benesch) say that the 14 (Patrick's team mate, Tony Stewart) was below me on track, and I didn't know the 17 (Stenhouse) was there on the high side of the track,' she said after the incident. 'My spotter took the blame on that one.

'I just didn't know Ricky was up there, and I obviously don't want to hit his car or anyone else with 10 laps to go. I talked with Ricky afterward, and we're fine. It's just a tough deal. We finished 19th even with the damage, so it was a decent run.' 

After pulling into the garage area after the race, Patrick quickly climbed out of her banged-up car and headed straight to the drivers' motorhome lot without speaking to the press.

Stenhouse finished 17th and didn't release any statement on the incident after the race.
