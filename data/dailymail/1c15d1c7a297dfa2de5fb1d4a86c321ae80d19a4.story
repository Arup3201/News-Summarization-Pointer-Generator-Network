Some of science’s greatest advances have been delivered by partnerships.

Think of Watson and Crick, who discovered the structure of DNA; Rutherford and Bohr, who developed a model of the atom; Banting and Best, who discovered insulin.

Will we one day be reading about the exploits of Edwards and Barker?

Jamie Edwards is the boy from Preston who two weeks ago entered the record books as the youngest person — he was 13 — in the world to build a nuclear fusion reactor. George Barker is his assistant, sidekick and loyal best friend.

George, 13, says: ‘I organise meetings for Jamie, and tidy up for him — he’s really, really messy; you should see his bedroom, it’s a right tip with stuff everywhere! I make brews for him — he  prefers hot chocolate with just a little bit of milk.’

But he leaves the science to Jamie. ‘I don’t help him build his experiments, because that’s his special project,’  he says.

For his part, Jamie — now 14 — says magnanimously: ‘He might chuck me a couple of spanners over. And he tries to calm me down when I get a bit stressed.’

Jamie and George, together with their 
brilliantly open-minded headmaster, Mr Hourigan, are sitting with me in 
one of the school science labs at Penwortham Priory Academy.

Jamie started building the reactor in October in a under-used science laboratory at his school

We are admiring the machine that, in a ‘radiation controlled area’ and in front of an audience of experts, helped Jamie achieve nuclear fusion from scratch, by using high energy to smash two hydrogen atoms together to make helium.

The ‘reactor’ is perched on a couple of scratched old lab tables and, to be  honest, doesn’t look terribly high-tech.

For a start, there’s lots of chicken wire.

‘That’s not chicken wire, it’s a Faraday cage!’ says Jamie, with a hint of indignation, a Faraday cage being a metallic enclosure that shields its contents from electric fields.

There are also endless plugs and a heavy metal lid, which falls off with a clank when Jamie leans on it.

‘We had a bit of a disaster a few minutes before the experiment — one of the two vacuum pumps stopped working, which shorted out the electrics,’ he says, pointing at a bit of metal.

‘But it was too late to turn it off and restart it, so we just risked it, and it worked.’

George is full of admiration for his friend.

‘It’s an amazing achievement — magnificent, really,’ he says. ‘I don’t think Jamie realises how big it is.’

Indeed, ever since the Geiger counter lurched into life, registering radiation and confirming that fusion had taken place, Jamie — and, to a lesser extent, George — have become famous.

After working against the clock, he finally finished the task of successfully making two atoms of hydrogen smash together to make a helium nuclear fusion

They have appeared on BBC news, been inundated with interview requests from all around the world and even clapped by older Year 11 pupils during their lunchtime.

‘Jamie likes his name being around the school and in the news,’  says George.

‘He likes the fame. I’m probably the same — it’s  great fun.’

While most amateur scientists would limber up by, for example, generating static electricity, or messing around with magnets and iron filings, Jamie has always set his sights a little higher.

This is a boy who had science birthday parties, knew an entire Encyclopedia Of Science off by heart by the age of seven, and thinks TV physicist Professor Brian Cox is ‘OK, but a bit slow.

He’s like: “We have a particle . . . and another particle.”’

So he cut his teeth on a nuclear reactor. ‘It was the first major experiment I’d done. I was browsing through some physics videos on YouTube — none of that pop rubbish — and I came across this boy called Taylor Wilson, who built his own nuclear fusion reactor when he was 14. I thought, why don’t I do that?’

So he did — after giving a very detailed Dragons’ Den-style pitch to Mr Hourigan, in which he explained why it was all such a good idea.

‘He was very convincing. And a bit scary,’ says Jim Hourigan, who is 57 and retiring this year (perhaps he wanted to go out with a bang).

Modest Jamie said: 'It is quite an achievement. It's magnificent really. I can't quite believe it - even though all my friends think I am mad'

‘I didn’t understand the science to start with — my background is in IT. So he had to explain it to me, and reassure me he wasn’t going to blow up the school and irradiate everybody — because as soon as you say nuclear reactor, people do tend to get all upset.

‘But he was so enthusiastic that I wanted to give him the opportunity — sometimes you have to take a bit of a risk to really invest in kids.’ So last April, with Mr Hourigan’s blessing and a budget of £3,000, Jamie set about ordering equipment and piecing his ‘reactor’ together.

He had a few bits and bobs already — not least his own Geiger counter, for measuring  radiation, bought with his Christmas money two Christmases ago.

‘He stands by the railway line measuring the nuclear waste trains for radiation as they go past,’ says George, who prefers carp fishing and motorbiking to investigating the mysteries of the atom.

‘They go past about five times a day from Sellafield to all the nuclear power plants in the country. When they’re full, the levels spike a bit,’ says Jamie.

13-year-old Jamie Edwards has become the youngest in the world to build a nuclear fusion reactor

‘And he goes round Springfields [a nuclear site near Preston]  picking all the stickers off the  lorries and taking them home,’ George adds proudly.

‘I run tests on them to see what’s in them — what’s contaminated,’ says Jamie, who is also a member of Fuser.net — ‘a group of amateur physicists like me who all have fusion reactors in their garage or basement, although some of them are really old — like 50!’

And so the other day, with George’s support and in this very room, Jamie flicked a switch and achieved nuclear fusion. Fission, which involves splitting atoms, is the process at the heart of atom bombs.

Fusion is the process that powers our sun and other stars. Jamie likes to refer to his experiment as creating ‘a star in a jar’.

‘I was confident it would work,’ says Jamie with a grin. ‘I wasn’t nervous. I’m never nervous. Even on TV, I’m chilled.’Unlike poor George. ‘I wasn’t chilled,’ he says. ‘I got very nervous. All those cameras!’

I can’t help wondering whether, just occasionally, it’s a teeny bit tricky being Jamie’s best friend. After all, he’s in the top set for everything, plays loads of musical instruments and cooks.

Perhaps the most annoying thing about Jamie is that, despite being good at absolutely everything, he is also good looking, charming and very entertaining company.

So does he have a girlfriend?

‘Not at the minute.’

‘He did!’ crows George.

‘It just sort of went downhill,  I guess.’

And George, do you ever think, ‘Blimey, wouldn’t it be nice if there was something Jamie wasn’t good at?’ ‘Yep. But he’s a good mate, too. And I’m better at motorbiking than him. And fishing. I’ve caught much bigger fish than him.’

What do they argue about?

‘Oh you know, whether the diffusion plugs should go on this side or the other side. He should listen to me sometimes,’ says George with a shrug. ‘But he always apologises — “Sorry boss!”.’

I mention the rumour that Jamie’s already planning his next experiment — building his very own Hadron Collider.

‘Yeah, maybe,’ he says. ‘If I get round to it. It’s a bit more challenging, but I reckon you could make a linear particle accelerator the size of this desk.’

While George wants to fix tractors for a living, Jamie has his heart set on Massachusetts Institute of Technology, one of the leading universities in the U.S. — ‘to study nuclear sciences and engineering, then maybe work in nuclear fusion and plasma physics’.

And make a lot of money?

‘A fair bit. Enough to get a fairly nice bike and live in the countryside somewhere. And I’d maybe make a flying car — a DeLorean with a fusion reactor on top. And maybe when I’m a bit older, I’ll go into politics — the Government seems to make a lot of bad decisions. But I’d have my own party.’

Of course he would.

And I bet it would do jolly well, too.
