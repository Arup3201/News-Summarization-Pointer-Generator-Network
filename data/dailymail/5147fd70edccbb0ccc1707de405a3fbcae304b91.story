The perfect gift for the billionaire who has everything has just come on the market - an idyllic tropical island tucked away in the Great Barrier Reef.

However, the Australian island is far from being a deserted getaway, as it hosts a 300-room luxury hotel and spa.

Daydream Island in Queensland, near the Whitsunday Islands, has doubtless shot to the top of the shopping list for the mega-rich after going up for sale for £75million.

The 4km-long island is covered in lush rainforest, and features the world's largest man-made coral reef lagoon.

Its hotel boasts a private golden beach for each guest, and the outdoor aquarium features 50 different corals and 80 types of sea life.

Moguls who are keen to enjoy snorkelling, jet-skiing, scuba diving and other aquatic activities will be keen to stake their claim to be the new owner of Daydream Island.

Flamboyant businessman Vaughan Bullivant snapped up the island in 2000, and is now hoping to hand it on to another entrepreneur after his retirement.

'But I'm 65 now and looking to at 
some stage put my feet up and enjoy doing other things in life including
more travel and spending time with my family, which has long been my 
goal,' he said.

'I 
intend to make sure that Daydream remains an industry leader and am 
looking for a suitable operator to take Daydream Island forward.'

Resort
boss Phil Casey said that the island had never looked better, and 
claimed that its natural beauty had helped it thrive throughout the 
recession.

'Daydream
Island has just completed a very positive 12 months of trading which is
extremely pleasing considering the tourism industry has had a very 
difficult time in recent years,' he said.

'The island's management has worked hard to position Daydream as an Australian holiday destination of choice.

'Visitors
are voting with their feet and giving fabulous feedback about our 
beautiful island and the great times they are having there.'

He
insisted the resort would not be sold to just anyone, and said he was 
confident the island would find a proprietor who is a good fit for the 
beautiful getaway.
