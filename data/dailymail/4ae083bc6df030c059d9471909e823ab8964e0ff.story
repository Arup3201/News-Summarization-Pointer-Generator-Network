It's the sort of job most of us dream of, where a day in the office would entail wolfing down hundreds of chocolates, all in the name of research.

This is the reality for lucky Matt Trotter, who eats more than 200 eggs in the two months running up to Easter, chomping down on 50kg of chocolate to make sure they're up to scratch.

But the Leeds resident is still in search of his perfect egg: one shaped like David Beckham.   

Matt Trotter from Leeds eats more than 200 Easter eggs for ASDA as part of his job as chocolate taster

The professional Easter egg taster for Asda spends eight hours a day tucking into the sweet treats 

The 26-year-old has always been passionate about the sweet things in life, initially training as a chef and then specialising in chocolate for six years before starting at Asda.

He said: 'What's not to love? I get to channel my creativity into my favourite foods - chocolates and sweets. My friends and family are really envious of my job when they're stuck at their desks 9-5 every day.'

Mr Trotter thinks he knows just what to look for when looking for the ideal chocolate egg.

He said: 'When testing, I always look for a creamy flavour in milk chocolate and a bold intense cocoa flavour with dark chocolate, but both must have a good snap!

'To benchmark our products, I'll taste at least 50 Easter Eggs at a time to make sure we score the best.' 

And the chocolate tasting doesn't stop after Easter.

'I look after all the seasonal periods such as Christmas and Halloween, tasting chocolates, sweeties, jellies and mallows in all shapes, sizes and flavours for up to eight hours a day, taking inspiration from countries all over the world to bring exciting new products into our ranges,' he said.

Altough Mr Trotter has tried more than 200 eggs, he is still waiting for someone to make an egg in the shape of his favourite footballer David Beckham (right) 

'I can't wait for our customers to see what we have coming in-store - the biggest buzz I get is knowing our shoppers really enjoy the products. I must admit when I go home, I give the chocolates and sweets a miss and stick to the fruit.'

And surely he must have a favourite now that he's tried almost all of them? 

He said: 'When it comes to Easter eggs, my dream would be a giant Easter egg in the shape of my favourite footballer - David Beckham. Who knows, maybe next year we'll get one on the shelves?'
