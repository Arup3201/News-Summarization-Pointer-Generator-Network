A Mormon has left the Jewish community incensed after 'insensitively' posthumously baptising the parents of a famous Holocaust survivor.

Asher and Rosa Wiesenthal, long-dead parents of the late Simon Wiesenthal, were baptised in a common practice offensive to many Jews.

The Simon Wiesenthal Center was left ‘outraged’ and said the actions make a ‘mockery’ of many meetings between Mormon and Jewish leaders.

Survivor: Simon Wiesenthal died in 2005 aged 96 and was a prominent Jewish rights advocate throughout his life after surviving several concentration camps

Rosa Wiesenthal died at the Nazi death 
camp at Belzec, Poland, in 1942, but Asher was killed years before in 
action as an Austrian soldier in 1915.

The Mormon Church is coming under more scrutiny thanks to Broadway show The Book of Mormon and Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign.

‘We are outraged that such insensitive
 actions continue in the Mormon Temples,’ Wiesenthal Center associate 
dean Rabbi Abraham Cooper said.

Rabbi
 Cooper said the faiths have been meeting since 1995 over the ‘unwanted 
and unwarranted posthumous baptisms’ of Holocaust victims.

‘The
 only way such insensitive practices would finally stop is if Church 
leaders finally decided to change their practices and policies,’ he 
added.

Mormon officials have apologised for what happened and said the actions by an ‘individual member’ were ‘against the policy of the Church’.

‘We have suspended indefinitely this person’s ability to access our genealogy records,’ a Mormon spokesman told the Salt Lake Tribune.

Expert Jewish genealogist Gary Mokotoff, of New Jersey, said he was told by the Church that the member’s wife has also had access suspended.

He spent years pushing the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to remove names of Holocaust victims from its genealogical index, reported the Salt Lake Tribune.

A new computer system now requires 
Mormons to avoid submitting names of Holocaust victims for baptism 
unless they are their direct ancestors.

Interest: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has been under heavier scrutiny since Mormon presidential candidate Mitt Romney began his campaign

Mr Wiesenthal died in 2005 aged 96 and was a top Jewish rights advocate in his life after surviving several concentration camps.

He spent his life documenting the crimes committed by Nazis and hunting perpetrators, including top SS official Adolf Eichmann.

The baptism of his parents was discovered last month by activist and ex-Mormon Helen Radkey, reported the Huffington Post.

Mr Romney helped baptise his staunch atheist relative Edward Roderick Davies, father of his wife Ann, years after the man had died in 1992.
