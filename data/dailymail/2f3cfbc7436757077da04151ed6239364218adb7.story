Extreme: Sophie-May Dickson, 22, from Essex, sees nothing wrong with giving her two daughters spray tan, nail polish, and designer clothes

A single mum who enjoys kitting herself out with hair extensions and a spray tan is set to ruffle feathers – because she lets her two year old and four year old daughters enjoy the same things too.

Sophie-May Dickson, 22, from Essex, sees nothing wrong with giving her daughters - Princess Bliss Tiana May, four, and PreciousBelle Ruby Rozina, two, - the works including spray tan, nail polish, and designer clothes.

The single mum, who has not worked since she left school at 16 is set to appear on Channel 5 programme Blinging up Baby on Monday.

But her 
unusual parenting methods are likely to come under the spotlight as they include letting her daughter have her first 
mahogany spray tan at just three years old.

However, Ms Dickson does step in and draw the line at seeing her daughter perform the
raunchy dance move twerking.

Yet she allows Princess to wear a blonde hair piece to other kids parties and says she has been wearing it since she was two.

Princess regularly applies hair serum to her own hair and shares an incredible designer wardrobe worth 
thousands of pounds with her sister.

The closet, which could rival many women’s wardrobes, includes a pair of Ralph Lauren sparkly flat shoes costing £90 and a D&G child's dress costing up to £400.

Princess's flashy pink bed costs around £1,000.

 ‘I go without so they can have these things,’ Ms Dickson said. 

She will not talk about how much she spends on her daughters, but admits that she often goes without to give them nice things.

She rules out shopping on the high street and prefers going to boutiques instead.

Ms Dickson split up with the girl’s father when Precious was very young, but makes sure the girls do not go without.

Her two year-old, Precious Belle Ruby Rozina, whom she describes as a ’tomboy’ has her ears pierced and nails done.

Both girls wear gold hoops in their ears and Ms Dickson reveals that Precious had her first pedicure at nine months.

Along with motherhood, Ms Dickson says that she is trying to 
improve herself by taking evening classes in maths and English and hopes
 to study psychology and be a counsellor.

But she is most proud of her two daughters.

She said she always wanted to have daughters and began shopping for glitzy things before she even had them and was on benefits.

She complains that some people are bitchy towards her about how much the things she buys cost especially when she posts photos on Facebook.

But she loves the fact that her daughters have the same ugg boots, hair pieces, and sexy juicy couture tracksuits as she does.

She told The Daily Mirror: ‘People are small-minded, they think I make her have the tan and wear the hair - but she wants it.

‘I would never put her on a sun bed. It's just a spray tan and she doesn't have it often. I'd like someone to tell me what is so bad?

‘Princess is not like other four-year-olds. She's intelligent. Although I did catch her twerking to a Miley Cyrus video.

Ms Dickson blames her own beauty habits for influencing her daughters desires. She said that once her little girl saw her getting a tan she wanted one too.

She adds: ‘As long as my girls are happy that's the main thing.’
