Faced with a sniffly date, most of us would think twice about locking lips.

Yet a leading professor says a cold shouldn't get in the way of romance – because you can't catch one by kissing.

This is despite the fact a survey has found 57 per cent of us would reject a first kiss with someone suffering from a case of the sniffles.

Professor Ron Eccles, director of the Common Cold Centre at Cardiff University, explained that the virus is spread through mucus, not saliva.

When it comes to avoiding a cold, it's safer to give your partner a kiss than hold their hand, experts say  

So while 86 per cent of us would prefer to hold hands with someone with a cold, according to the research, you're actually more likely to be infected that way – as fingers easily become contaminated, passing the virus to the nose and eye.

The research, carried out by nasal decongestant Otrivine, found that a potential partner turning up on a date with a common cold is a major turn-off.

Indeed, a fifth of us (21 per cent) would cancel a second romantic rendezvous if our date had turned up with the sniffles.

Seeing a date wipe their nose on their sleeve is too much for four in five Brits (79 per cent), who would not go on a second date.

Over half (59 per cent) also said eating with an open mouth was a turn off while coughing (34 per cent) and sneezing (32 per cent) were the top turns off for others.

The study of 1,000 Brits also suggests females are more wary of falling ill.

Women are less likely to kiss someone with a cold (70 per cent wouldn't compared to 44 per cent of men).

A cautious fifth of us (22 per cent) wouldn't share a bed with a partner if they had a cold and 46 per cent wouldn't lock lips.

Professor Eccles said: 'The common cold virus travels in the mucus from the respiratory system.

'So unless you have a bad cough, and some of the respiratory mucus has made its way into your saliva, the cold virus will not be transmitted by kissing.'

He added: 'The cold virus is transferred by contaminated fingers that pass the virus to the nose and eye.

'Your fingers can easily become contaminated with viruses by holding hands with someone who has coughed or sneezed into their hands, or by touching door handles in public places.

'You may then touch your nose or eye and infect yourself. Tears from the eye drain via a duct into the nasal cavity and when we touch our eyes with contaminated fingers we pass viruses into the nose.

'To spread the infection you need to have close and prolonged contact with other people, to cough or sneeze on them, or pass on secretions from your nose via your hands.'

Gareth Coady, from Otrivine, said: 'The research demonstrates peoples lack of understanding surrounding the common cold.

'Many do not understand how cold and flu viruses are transferred, putting themselves at greater risk of catching a cold.'
