It is the latest viral phenomenon that has taken over the internet, with more than a million people drenching themselves in icy water.

And if that doesn't sound bad enough, the charity challenge, which has been taken on by celebrities ranging from David Beckham to Bill Gates, hasn't been going quite to plan for some of those getting involved.

One man was crushed by wheelie bin full of icy water and a woman slipped over in her bathtub while trying to complete the dare in aid of Lou Gehrig's disease.

Someone should have warned Matthew Bieler that standing below a garbage can full of icy water was not the best idea.

The heavy wheelie bin hit the American teenager on the head after fragile garage roof guttering fell apart.

Everyone who takes the challenge makes a donation to the ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) Foundation, which heads the fight against Lou Gehrig's.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord.

The progressive degeneration of the motor neurons in ALS eventually leads to their death.

When the motor neurons die, the ability of the brain to initiate and control muscle movement is lost.
