The Duke of Edinburgh, Captain General of the Royal Marines, presented the medals to the troops. Their return marks the last time Royal Marines will deploy in unit strength as the drawdown of forces from Afghanistan approaches.

The 700 who marched in Taunton today were led by the Band of the Royal Marines. Following the march, which was expected to be attended by crowds of up to 15,000, a short ceremony was held in the centre of town.

For the men involved, there is a huge relief to be home.

Sgt Richard Winslade said: 'Good riddance Afghanistan. I haven't got much affection for Afghanistan, it was just a job. I'm glad it's over.

'It's horrendous, especially if you know those who are killed. But it's a matter of cracking on with life and the job. You get back from the tour and that's when you reflect on what's happened.'

Libby Lisgo, mayoress of Taunton Deane, gave civic thanks to the Marines.

She said: 'The sun is shining, Taunton
 is at its best for its best. Today it is my very real pleasure to 
welcome 40 Commando back to Taunton.

'In 2001 40 Commando were the first Commando unit in Afghanistan. The Royal Marines have lost a total of 61 killed in action.

'40 Commando themselves have suffered a total of 18 killed in action in Afghanistan.

My thoughts today and I am sure the 
thoughts of all of us gathered here are with the families and the 
friends of those 18, for whom life will never be quite the same.'

Family members of Marines said their 
thoughts were indeed with the loved ones of those who had lost their 
lives during deployment.

40 Commando lost 14 men in their second tour in 2010 alone.

The homecoming parade was the third for 40 Commando following events in 2008 and 2010 when thousands lined the streets of Taunton to pay tribute

The Royal Marines of 40 Commando homecoming parade marks the last major element of more than 14,000 Royal Marines who have withdrawn from Afghanistan after 10 years of deployment

The British Army created its first commando unit in 1940 and from 1942 on, it joined with the Royal Marines. It was during the 1939-45 war, that the Royal Marines took on a commando role, linking the regiment to the Army Commandos that already existed.

Winston Churchill had ordered the creation of a 'butcher and bolt' small group raiding unit after the defeat at Dunkirk and the evacuation of the BEF from mainland Europe.

The commandos task was to land in Nazi-occupied Western Europe usually at night, destroy vital targets and leave as quickly as possible.

In June 1940, Churchill had called for 20,000 men; men he called 'leopards' ready to spring at the throats of the Germans.'There ought to be at least 20,000 Storm Troops or 'Leopards' drawn from existing units, ready to spring at the throats of any small landings or descents.'

That month a department in the War Office was created to deal with the issues surrounding the creation of such a force. This office was to become Combined Operations as it involved all three services

Recruits were drawn from the British Army. Churchill himself ordered that thye should be equipped with the best equipment. In 1942, men from the Royal Marines joined (40 Commando was formed in February 1942) and recruits were also drawn from the British Police Force.

Selection for the new commando force was necessarily demanding. Men had to be physically very fit. But they also had to show that they did not need the traditional chain of command to operate in the field as in the heat of battle such chains of command could break down.

Initiative was considered to be a vital commodity. Some 400 men passed through the first phase of recruitment - which included training when live ammunition was being used.

The first official commando raid was in June 1940 on the northern French coast.  Commandos were also in action in other parts of France, Norway, the Middle East and Italy. They played also significant part in D-Day.

'We are also here because Taunton really supports 40 Commando.

'We have been through a range of emotions but it is fabulous to be here today. It is such a relief to have Sam back, words can’t describe it.

'We knew he was going out there, it is what he joined to do and we supported him.'

The homecoming marks the last major element of more than 14,000 Royal Marines who have withdrawn from Afghanistan after 10 years of deployment.

It was the third for 40 Commando following events in 2008 and 2010 when thousands lined the streets of Taunton to pay tribute.

David and Jo Daykin, from Nottingham, took grandsons Harry, five, and Isaac, seven, to watch the Marines.

Mr Daykin, who is retired, said: 'We are here to support the troops. We have just got to support them, it is so important.

'It is brilliant to watch them today, it is better than we could have imagined.

'We know one or two of the lads here today as well, so it was another reason to come.'

40 Commando have served in Afghanistan three times, though some members of the unit went out to the country in 2001. Their final tour was completed in April this year, making today their third homecoming.

Many members of Somerset County Council attended the parade in Taunton, with staff handing out flags for well-wishers to wave. The authority said it was using the parade as a reminder of the Armed Forces Community Covenant.

The Covenant, which is led by the council, is a partnership of local armed forces, local authorities and the voluntary sector and promotes opportunities to link military and civilian societies.

Groups across the county can apply for grants from a £35 million national Ministry of Defence fund for projects. The Covenant was established in February 2012.

One successful bid has been for 4-40, a family support group for local Royal Marines and a £58,000 play area for children at Bishop Henderson School in Taunton.

Interim Leader of the council John Osman, said: 'I'm delighted that Somerset turned out in force to welcome home the Royal Marines of 40 Commando and thanked them for their sacrifice and bravery.

'It's important that our Armed Forces, which are so well represented in Somerset, receive our year-round support and the Covenant is one way in which we can help encourage that.

'I'm sure there must be many more ideas for projects that the Partnership would really like to hear about - and I hope we will see many more applications later this year.'
