Crews are preparing to investigate a mystery radiation leak 2,000 feet underground in a facility where waste from the country's nuclear weapons program is kept in sealed containers

Officials are at a loss to explain what has caused the excessive leak at the Carlsbad Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico which is designed to store waste underground for centuries.

Operations at the desert facility were shut down following an incident earlier this month when a truck caught fire underground and several workers suffered smoke inhalation.

Deep below: Radioactive waste is buried in the salt formations in special casks

Sealed: The salt is supposed to keep the waste from penetrating water supplies

Massive: WIPP is the third deepest geological storage site in the world, behind two facilities in German

Search postponed: Investigators haven't been able to go underground yet to find the source of the leak

Timeline: The facility is expected to continue accepting waste until 2030

The World Isolation Pilot Plant was opened in 1999 to store transuranic radioactive waste for 10,000 years.

It is the third deepest geological storage center int he word after two different repositories in Germany.

The facility receives waste contaminated with plutonium, uranium, americium and neptunium.

Transuranic waste are materials that come in contact with radiation such as gloves, tools, rags and machinery.

While they may not be as potent as nuclear reactor byproducts, transuranic waste can continue to contaminate for up to 24,000 years.

Since it opened in 1999, WIPP has processed 400,000 55-gallon drums containing these radioactive materials and functioned without incident until Friday.

These cask drums are stored in rooms constructed into the salt basin 2,150 feet below ground.

The rooms will help seal the materials from posing a risk to public health since it takes a billion years for water to move even an inch in the salty basin. 

Department of Energy investigators 
still don't know whether that incident played a role in this new leak, 
since they haven't been cleared to go underground to find the source.

'They
 will not go in today. It's a safety thing more than anything. We're 
waiting until we get other assessments done before we authorize 
re-entry,' DOE spokesman Bill Mackie said.

An air monitor which detects airborne radiation went off around 11pm Friday.

While it wasn't the first time alarms have rung at the facility, officials believe this was the first real alarm in the history of the plant since it opened in 1999.

Because the plant was in shutdown mode, no employees were underground when the alarm went off and none of the 139 workers above ground were exposed. 

The alarm system automatically 
switched the the facility's ventilation system to filtration in order to
 keep the leak from reaching the surface.

The
 WIPP sits over salt deposits which help seal transuranic waste 
discarded from the country's nuclear weapons program such as machinery 
and clothing. 

The
 salt deposits keep the material from contaminating water supplies since
 it takes about a billion years for water to move an inch in the 
deposits.

The plant processes some 6,000 cubic meters of radiative waste a year and employs 800 people.

It is expected to continue accepting materials until 2030. 

Waiting to investigate: Officials still don't know what caused the leak or how much was leaked
