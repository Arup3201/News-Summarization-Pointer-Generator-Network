Bad reception: Chadwick Lange, 43, had just moved to Manhattan from Miami when his Maserati was stolen

A Miami real estate agent who recently moved to Manhattan didn't exactly receive a warm welcome when his Maserati was stolen over the weekend.

It didn't help that he left the car running in the middle of Times Square when he hopped out to say hello to a friend.

Chadwick Lange, 43, reportedly made an easy target for two thieves who posed as Maserati enthusiasts who said they wanted to take pictures of the vehicle, which retails for more than $150,000.

The New York Daily News reports that Mr Lange was driving through Times Square around 4.40am on Sunday morning when he saw a friend at the corner of 47th and Broadway.

'He puts the car in park but doesn't take the keys out. His friend is there, he starts talking to him while these two guys come up to him,' an unidentified police source tells the paper.

The two men take some pictures of the car, and while Mr Lange is talking to his friend, one of the men slips in the driver's seat and speeds away.

Wising up quickly, Mr Lange runs after the car and the second thief who was doing the same.

The car slowed down to pick up the second suspect, but sped away up Eighth Avenue too quickly for Mr Lange to catch them.

Pricey: Mr Lange parked his 2008 GranTurismo Maserati, similar to the car shown, in Times Square to say hello to a friend in the early hours of Sunday morning

Middle of the city: Two men approached Mr Lange in Times Square and asked to take a picture with the expensive car and he allowed them to, but then they drove away with it

When reached by The Daily News, Mr Lange declined to comment citing the on-going police investigation and insurance claim.

His car and the two suspects still remain at large.

Mr Lange recently moved up to New York from Florida and though reports of the stolen car do not include his photo, his picture has been taken at several society events both in Bridgehampton and in Miami.

He works as a real estate broker for both Willoughby Realty Group and Xcellence Realty Llc.
