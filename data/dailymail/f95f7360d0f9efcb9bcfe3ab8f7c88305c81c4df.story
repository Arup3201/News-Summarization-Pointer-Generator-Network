Brazil's most famous monkey has been reunited with its 71-year-old owner, weeks after hard-hearted police officers tore it from her arms and locked it in a primate pound.

Chico the tufted Capuchin was thrust into the spotlight when Brazilian environmental officials seized it from the home of Elizete Carmona after 37 yeas of living together.

And today Carmona, who brought Chico from a truck driver in 1976 after it bit one of his children, said it was a 'dream come true' to see her beloved monkey, gushing: 'The family is once again complete.'

The cat-sized monkey, with 
expressive, honey-colored eyes, golden fur 
and a black Mohawk atop his head, is now again free to roam the pensioner's back 
yard which she shares with her other two loves - a pet cat and a chicken.

Confused: Environmental officers renamed the monkey Carla after discovering it was female

Officers
took the primate earlier this month because it is illegal to keep wild animals as pets in 
Brazil, especially those classified as endangered. They swiftly renamed Chico as Carla after discovering he is an fact a she.

But after a groundswell of public anger the aging simian came home - to a big hug and a hearty meal of milk and fruit.

'It's like a dream come true,' Carmona 
told the Globo television network as she embraced the monkey. She said 
she would continue calling her pet Chico.

'It was really cruel to take him away from me,' she said. 'For me he will always be my son Chico.'

An officer with Sao Paulo state's environmental police department anonymously revealed the primate was returned late on Monday.

The
officer said Judge Gabriela Muller Attanasio ordered the cat-sized 
monkey returned to its home in Sao Carlos after police took it to a 
protection center because of laws that restrict the keeping of wild 
animals as pets.

After Chico was taken to the animal protection center in the city of Assis, more than 300 kilometers from Sao Carlos, thousands of people signed an online petition calling on Sao Paulo state environmental officials to return the monkey to Carmona.

The monkey's removal followed warning letters from state and federal authorities dating back 20 years, Globo's G1 internet portal quoted Carmona as saying. The family has insisted it had received special permission to keep Chico.

The Carmonas adopted Chico in 1976, decades before a 1998 law that banned the acquisition and possession of wild animals. The Carmona family had said that Chico was completely domesticated and might not survive the stress of separation.

Chico was brought from central Brazil by a truck driver, who gave it to the Carmona family after the monkey bit one of his children.

'The father wanted to kill the monkey. His wife intervened and because she liked me, she ended up giving him to me,' Carmona told Globo earlier this year. 'I started taking care of him. He never once bit me.'
