Women struggling to conceive have a right to receive treatment, according to NICE guidelines

The health watchdog yesterday told NHS managers to stop refusing women IVF, warning it is having a ‘devastating effect’ on their lives.

NICE has been forced to issue new guidance to local trusts over concerns there is a postcode lottery in the availability of treatment to couples struggling to have a baby.

Women under 40 unable to conceive naturally are meant to be offered three courses of IVF on the NHS while those aged 40 to 42 should be offered one.

But figures show that three-quarters of the 211 GP-led bodies fail to adhere to these rules. This includes six which do not offer any fertility treatment at all.

NICE – the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence – has also told trusts not to refuse women treatment just because their husbands or partners have children from previous relationships.

Professor Gillian Leng, deputy chief executive of NICE, said: ‘Infertility is a recognised medical condition that can affect people of any age and has a potentially devastating effect on people’s lives.

‘It can cause significant distress, depression and can possibly lead to the breakdown of relationships.

‘Unfortunately, we know that not all areas are following our guidance. This creates variations in treatment within the NHS, which is disappointing and goes against the fundamental aims of the NHS.’

The latest rules also remind organisations to offer cancer sufferers and other chemotherapy patients the chance to freeze their eggs before as the treatment can leave them infertile.

But last month, a 25-year-old artist was refused the £4,000 procedure by her NHS trust in Thanet, Kent, as it disagreed with the policy.

Elizabeth Rose suffers from a severe form of Crohn’s disease and is about to undergo a bone marrow transplant and chemotherapy, which is likely to trigger an early menopause.

NICE first issued its guidelines telling NHS trusts to offer at least three cycles of fertility treatment in 2004. But, more than a decade on, most still fail to comply.

The watchdog warned the 'postcode lottery' is leaving couples struggling to conceive 'devastated'

A survey of the 211 GP-led bodies called Clinical Commissioning Groups earlier this year found that just 24 per cent offered the recommended three rounds of IVF.

The guidelines are not enshrined by law so CCGs draw up their own policies depending on their budgets.

Typically, IVF costs £3,500 a cycle – or £10,500 for three – and managers are reluctant to fund it.

Sarah Norcross, co-chairman of the National Infertility Awareness Campaign, said: ‘It’s high time patients were allowed to access the treatment they are entitled to.’

She added that NICE’s action will make it clear ‘exactly what is needed to bring the unfair postcode lottery approach to an end’.

Last week, Commons leader and former health secretary Andrew Lansley said CCGs had ‘responsibility’ to obey NICE’s guidelines even though they were not law.

The issue was raised by Tory MP Caroline Dinenage, who told how women in her Hampshire constituency are offered one round of IVF up to 35 and refused thereafter.
