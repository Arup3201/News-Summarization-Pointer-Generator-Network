A teenage football fan today claimed Sports Direct refused to print a tribute to Hillsborough victims on his Liverpool shirt - in case it caused offence.

Nicholas Bieber, 18, of Northampton, wanted to pay tribute to the lives lost in the 1989 disaster by having ‘Justice 96’ on the back of his red jersey.

But he was stunned to be told by staff at his local branch of the sports retail giant last Saturday that they could not print this, in case it upset other people.

His experience has now caught the eye of ex-Liverpool striker Robbie Fowler, who re-tweeted a message the teenager sent to him about the incident to his 360,000 followers on Twitter.

Mr Bieber said: ‘The staff said they couldn’t print it because it might cause offence to other people.  I was shocked and I am very angry. It’s something I want to support and show my affection for.

‘I’m very frustrated. A national sports outlet should employ people with common sense. I don’t think it could offend anyone. There’s a big difference between causing offence and supporting a worthy cause.

‘In light of what has emerged recently there’s not a decent person in Britain that would not want justice for those who lost their lives on that day.’

Support: The teenager has even now caught the eye of former Liverpool striker Robbie Fowler, 37, who re-tweeted a message the teenager sent to him about the incident to his 360,000 followers on Twitter

He tweeted Fowler, 37, about the incident soon
 after it happened, saying: ‘Just got refused by Sports Direct to have 
the name & number 'Justice 96' printed on the back of my #LFC shirt!
 #disgrace’.

A Sports Direct spokesman was not available to comment on the matter when contacted today.

But in 2009 the store ruled only to allow the printing of current football players’ names and numbers on football shirts after a Manchester United fan was sold a shirt mocking the Hillsborough disaster.

Sports Direct was forced to issue a public apology about the ‘wholly inappropriate’ jersey after the fan paid £55 for a shirt on which the figure '96' was printed, and below that the slogan ‘Not Enough’.

Disaster: The Hillsborough tragedy happened when a crush at an FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at the Hillsborough stadium in Sheffield in April 1989 resulted in 96 deaths

The company immediately changed its printing policy after the fan posted images of the shirt on Facebook, with the Hillsborough Family Support Group saying the printing of it ‘incited trouble’.

Sports Direct, a cut-price sports clothing and equipment retailer, has more than 470 stores in Britain, employs around 19,000 staff and was founded by Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley.

The Hillsborough tragedy was a crush at an FA Cup semi-final match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at the stadium in Sheffield in April 1989, which resulted in 96 deaths.

An independent panel reported last week, 23 years after the tragedy occurred, that police attempted to blame fans for the disaster and 41 of those who died could have been saved.
