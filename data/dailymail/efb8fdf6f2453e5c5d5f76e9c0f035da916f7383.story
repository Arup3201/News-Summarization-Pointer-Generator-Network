As Spain's economy faces financial meltdown it has emerged that the country has its very own 'Fred the Shred' Goodwin, who is to receive a multimillion payout at the same time as his failing bank asks for a £15billion bailout.

The news that former finance director at crippled Spanish lender Bankia Aurelio Izquierdo is to receive £11million after stepping down from his position at the bank has infuriated the Spanish public.

Mr Izquierdo, who is one of a number of bankers to receive huge bonuses during Spain's artificially inflated property boom, has also received heavy criticism from the country's political opponents.

Anger: Former Bankia finance director Aurelio Izquierdo, left, who is to receive £11million despite the bank asking for a £15billion bailout. The story is reminiscent of Fred 'The Shred' Goodwin - the former chief executive of RBS

Britain's top share index bounced back in early trade this morning, recovering after a sharp fall yesterday that took it below the 5,300 point level, with Wednesday's big fallers - banks, energy, and mining stocks - leading the rally.

Both the party in power - the centre-right Partido Popular and the Catalan Republic Left have united in their disgust for the banker who they say is making a huge profit out of a terrible situation.

Mr Izquierdo's story is reminiscent of Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) banker Fred Goodwin whose Knighthood was annulled in 2009 after his strategy of aggressive expansion led to the near collapse of the company in 2008.

The Spanish version of Mr Goodwin could receive his huge sum within weeks while the plight of Bankia remains in the balance.

Precarious: Spain's attempts to rescue the troubled institution are floundering after the European Central Bank reportedly refused to participate in a £12billion 'back door' bonds-for-cash salvage effort

Big decisions: As the Eurozone's future hangs in the balance German Chancellor Angela Merkel found something to drink to with EU commission president Jose Manuel and other Baltic Sea nations

Spain's attempts to rescue the 
troubled institution are floundering after the European Central Bank 
reportedly refused to participate in a £12billion 'back door' 
bonds-for-cash salvage effort.

Financial
markets and the euro plunged as Spain's deepening bank crisis sparked 
fears about the necessity for the enormous bailout.

The FTSE 100 and other top European 
markets saw another 1-2 per cent wiped off their value, while the euro 
fell to two-year lows of $1.2431 against the dollar and hovered just 
below 80p against the pound - or €1.25.

It also emerged that Spain's central bank governor was effectively being ousted - he is to retire a month earlier than expected on June 10.

As concerns about the costs of funding Spain's banking system and cash-strapped regional authorities mounted, beleaguered Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy was also struggling with ruinously high borrowing costs on international markets.

Bankia representatives say the cash being channeled to Mr Izquierdo comes from a pot of funds which have already been accounted for at Bancaja - one of seven savings banks which combined in 2011 to form Bankia.

According to reports in the Spanish 
press yesterday Mr Izquierdo is not the only banker to be making money 
will the country's economy teeters on the brink.

A
further £108million will be dished out to bank executives quitting 
bankrupt or merged lenders in the forthcoming weeks, it has been 
claimed.

This figure includes £5million to Matias Amat, another executive at Bancia who retired last autumn.
