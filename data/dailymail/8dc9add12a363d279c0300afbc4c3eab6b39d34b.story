This week the Royal family hope to be celebrating a very important date as they, along with the rest of the nation, wait on tenter hooks for the arrival of the new heir to the throne.

There's also another reason to celebrate this Wednesday: if the baby arrives today he/she will be sharing his/her birthday with new grandmother Camilla, as the Duchess of Cornwall celebrates her 66th birthday.

Camilla and husband Prince Charles were in Lostwithielfor, Cornwall for the celebrations, where they completed their three-day visit of Devon and Cornwall.

A beaming Camilla visited the sunshine-filled town square where she was presented with a candle covered birthday cake in the shape of a hat while the Lostwithiel Town Band played 'Happy Birthday'.

Camilla, who was wearing an Anna Valentine-designed cream patterned silk dress, cut the birthday cake with a ceremonial sword after being presented with it by Mayor of Lostwithiel, Gill Parsons.

Camilla said: 'Thank you very much.'

Lord Lieutenant of Cornwall, Colonel Edward Bolitho handed her the sword but the Duchess needed a little help from her husband to cut through the black and white iced fruit cake.

The crowd then erupted into an impromptu chorus of Happy Birthday, with Charles joining in.

Yesterday Camilla revealed that the Royal Family expects William and Kate’s baby to be born by the end of the week.

She told well-wishers in St Austell, Cornwall: 'We are all just waiting by the telephone. We are hopeful that by the end of the week he or she will be here.'

On Monday the Duchess  was presented with an early birthday present - a card made by blind and partially sighted children.

Camilla, said she was delighted with 
the card, which was created by children at the WESC Foundation in 
Exeter, where she is a patron.

Her
 visit to the centre, which provides specialist learning, care and 
therapy to blind and partially sighted four to 25-year-olds, came on her
 second day of engagements in Devon and Cornwall.

Camilla's visit to WESC marked the opening of Cornwall House, an accommodation unit for five young people at the centre.

Marie Larcombe, 20, presented the Duchess with a posy of flowers as children sang in a choir and played drums during a reception in a marquee.

Louie Britton, 15, then handed Camilla the large card decorated with Braille and moon symbols.

The Duchess told the reception of 150 guests: "Oh, look at those beautiful flowers.

'Thank you very much.'

Louie said: 'Giving her the card was brilliant.

'It had flowers on and she said they looked beautiful.

'It was fun to give her an early birthday present.'

Day two: The Duchess of Cornwall opted for a printed chiffon dress for 
the occasion, while the Prince of Wales was smart in his customary 
double-breasted blazer. The two make a trip to the region every year

Camilla was also given a tour of facilities at WESC, where children and young people are given neurovisual therapy (NVT).

NVT links visual impairment to brain activity and damage and is used to treat those who have suffered brain injuries, such as those caused by tumours and accidents.

Camilla, wearing a green flowery dress, pearls and tan court shoes, crouched to share a hug with two guide dogs, Archie and Janie, as she was given a tour of facilities.

Tom West and Maria Doweswell, also 18, then proudly showed the Duchess Cornwall House, where they will move in this September.

Mr West told Camilla he was a DJ on WESC's radio show, VI Radio, in the evenings.

Camilla replied: 'I will have to tune in.

'Oh, but it coincides with the Archers. Are you on for two hours?'

Mr West laughed with the Duchess and added: 'I never miss an opportunity to plug my show.'

He also joked with the royal visitor that he would eat takeaways at his new home, as he was not an accomplished cook.

'You must learn to cook a few things for yourself,'she told him.

As she unveiled a plaque to mark the opening of Cornwall House, she thanked staff for their work.

'I can't say how pleased I am,' she said.

'It has been five years since my last visit. I have come back and everything has changed, everything has got better.

'I think anyone would be very pleased to live in Cornwall House.'
