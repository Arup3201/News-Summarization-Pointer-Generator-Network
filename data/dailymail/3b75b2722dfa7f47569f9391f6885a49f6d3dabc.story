With her short jet black locks and down to earth attitude, Emma Willis is one of the nation’s sweethearts.

Her star is in the ascendant too. She was recently announced as the new presenter of Big Brother, and will continue as presenter of the cheeky discussion spin off show, Bit On The Side.

Now the mother-of-two has revealed an edgy high-glamour look to accompany her new role as she smoulders in a sexy photo shoot.

Emma worries that her laid back dress sense and short locks can make her look like a boy from behind

She has warned we should be expecting a 
dramatic change in her signature look- as she plans to chop off her hair
and dye it platinum blonde.

Speaking in this months Cosmopolitan magazine, Emma says her plan is to make her hair: ‘Really short and platinum!

‘But people have got to know me with this look, so I want to wait for a bit.'

Ex-model Emma looks right at home in front of the lens for the Cosmopolitan shoot with her frosty blue eyes framed with heavy eyeliner, and her shoulder length hair tousled sexily around her face.

In another shot her hair is slicked back off her face with simple fresh make up, jazzed up with a pop of colour from her pink matte lips.

Despite her plan for a drastic chop, the 37-year-old says that she finds having short hair can have its problems.

Emma says the trickiest thing about having short hair is dressing herself: 'I like to wear jeans, Converse and a sweater, so from the back I can sometimes look like a boy!'

Speaking about who's cropped locks she envies she says, Emma says: 'Anne Hathaway – she looks amazing. Miley Cyrus’s bleached, shaved look is really cool too – she’s got the confidence to carry it off.'

'I’ve had short hair for ten years. I tried varying lengths of short, before growing it out. Then I had my daughter and it went all thin and rubbish, so I just chopped it off again!'

It was announced earlier this month that Emma is replacing Brian Dowling as the host of Big Brother.

Willis, who is married to former Busted star Matt, is currently the host of spin-off show Big Brother's Bit On The Side.

The presenter, who will also front Celebrity Big Brother, said: 'I am thrilled to have been offered this job.'

The show will return this summer.

Emma started her presenting career at MTV in 2002 for TRL, and moved onto other shows including I’m a Celebrity…Get Me Out Of Here! NOW, T4 and Girlfri3nds. 

She is currently also hosting the Heart Sunday Breakfast show and The Hub on This Morning.
