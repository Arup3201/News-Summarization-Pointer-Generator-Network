He has just won an Oscar for his moving portrayal of one of the world’s most famous men. But this is the first photograph of Eddie Redmayne in his latest role ... as a woman.

Or, to be exact, a man who became a woman. For he plays transgender pioneer Einar Wegener – later known as Lili Elbe – in The Danish Girl. 

The movie, set in the 1920s, is a love story about how Wegener, a painter, was persuaded by his wife Gerda Waud (played by Alicia Vikander) – who was also an artist – to pose for her in women’s clothes after one of her models failed to show. In time, he became Lili and started on the transformation into a woman.

It could hardly be a bigger contrast to Redmayne’s Oscar-winning role as Professor Stephen Hawking in The Theory Of Everything. 

Redmayne told the Mail that he has been ‘observing the minutiae of feminine physicality’, and to play Lili he worked with movement director Alexandra Reynolds, who also helped him choreograph his movements as Hawking. 

Redmayne said he started working with Reynolds early in January, when she flew out to LA to help him begin to create his portrait of Lili.

‘We’re looking at everything from a feminine perspective,’ he explained. Eddie called the true story of Wegener and his wife Gerda a study of ‘authenticity, identity and love’. ‘I think it’s the most sensitive role I have played,’ the 33-year-old actor added.

He said he had spoken with members of the trans community, to research his role – though, of course, the sexual orientation was in its infancy in the 1920s, and there was little notion of surgery.

‘The danger of surgery was so extreme then,’ Eddie said. ‘It’s such a brave thing that Einar did.’

Many of Wegener’s wife Gerda’s most famous works show a coquettish woman with beautiful legs. It later emerged that they were posed for by her husband.

Amber Heard, Matthias Schoenaerts and Ben Whishaw will also star in The Danish Girl, which is likely to be a contender for next year’s award season.

The Danish Girl, directed by Tom Hooper for Working Title Films, will be distributed by Universal Pictures towards the end of the year.
