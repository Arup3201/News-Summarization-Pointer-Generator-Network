A mother who lost her young son in a tragic accident is now running a single-handed campaign to get statutory bereavement leave extended for parents who lose a child from the current three days to at least four weeks.  

Lucy Herd's 23-month-old son Jack drowned in their garden pond in August 2010 when Lucy took her eyes off him for just a short moment.   

On top of the unimaginable grief, Lucy discovered that as a bereaved parent her then-partner could take just three days paid leave off work - one of which had to be for the funeral.

Any additional time was to be taken as either sick leave or holiday.

This compounded the pain of the grieving process and left both parents without the support of the other at a time when both were incredibly fragile.

'As a mum my world died the day Jack died,' Lucy said. 'It was every mother's worst nightmare: I took my eyes off Jack for those split moments and he wandered away from my protection.'

'I don't really remember the days straight after Jack's death, I remember feeling a pain like no other, I can honestly say my heart physically hurt and that hurt is still there but trying to make a positive heals me slightly.

'When my family all left as they had to go back to work as their bereavement leave had ended I felt alone, lost and abandoned, how on earth was I going to continue to live without their support and love around me 24/7?

'But I did live and I have survived, and I'm now campaigning for other parents not to have to worry about losing their jobs after a death of a child. It is a great healing process as is setting up Jack's Rainbow.'

The pressures of bereavement eventually led to Lucy separating from Jack's dad, and she has since left Cumbria, where they lived, and moved with her two older children to Owlsmoor, in Berkshire, to be closer to her family. 

Lucy said: 'My world died the day Jack died'

Although granting only three days off after the death of a child may seem unthinkable, a parent whose child has died is not entitled to any statutory leave under the law.

There is in fact very little legislation on such issues, leaving companies to grant 'compassionate leave' at their discretion.

At
present, parents may be entitled to 'time off for dependents'. This is a
legal right to unpaid leave to cope with family emergencies. Although 
there is no upper limit to the amount of time specified, it should be 'reasonable' and should only be the amount that is 'sufficient' to deal 
with the situation.

Directgov
guidance said: 'There's no set amount of time allowed to deal with an 
unexpected event involving a dependant - it will vary depending on what 
the event is but for most cases one or two days should be sufficient to 
deal with the problem.'

Lucy said: 'When
a child dies, particularly if that death is sudden and unexpected, 
there should be provision for the parents to take paid time off work.

'While 
many good employers offer compassionate leave, there is no statutory 
right to leave and this campaign aims to introduce four weeks of paid "bereavement leave" for parents. 

'In
the immediate aftermath of the death parents have to cope with their 
own loss, the grief of their wider family, including other children, as 
well as a vast amount of administrative and other arrangements.'   

Three days is not enough: Lucy is hoping that she can persuade parliament to vote to grant all grieving parents at least four weeks off work

She continued: 'A sudden or accidental death may require a post mortem or inquest; there is a funeral to arrange; and many other organisations to contact from schools to benefit offices.'

Lucy is in the process of setting up a charity in Jack's memory called Jack's Rainbow. It will provide other families with round-the-clock support and funding for holidays in order to try and create new memories for the family. She is also planning a campaign in the summer to highlight the danger of garden ponds.

Lucy's aim is to get the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills to change the statutory leave entitlement for an employee who has lost a child from three days to four weeks.

Lucy is hoping she can persuade parliament to vote to grant all grieving parents at least four weeks off work.

An online petition has been started by Lucy which needs 100,000 signatures to force the Government to have a debate on the issue.  The petition can be found here.
