Fears have been raised that the Houses of Parliament have been infested with a breed 'mutant' rats which are becoming immune to traditional poisons.

Up to £6,000 a month is being spent on pest control at Westminster, according to figures released in response to a Freedom of Information request.

The amount being spent on tackling pests at the Commons has risen 15 per cent in the last two years.

Concerns have been raised that the number of rats resistant to poison is on the rise at the Houses of Parliament

According to the Daily Star, while officials have attempted to play down any concern of an increase in the recently publicised 'mutant rats', one source told the paper: 'You can see from the pest control figures that this is a mounting problem.'

Experts have warned the rats are on the 
increase across parts of the country after building up a resistance to 
normal toxic pellets and powders.

Conservative MP Sir Paul Beresford, a member of the Commons Commission, told MailOnline he was not aware of mutant rats at the Houses of Parliament but said there was a 'constant battle' against rodents.

He said: 'It is an old building and it is on the river and like all buildings on the river and old buildings we have a constant battle.

'All sorts of techniques are used to deal with this, right through to using a kestrel, but I don't know about the so-called mutant rats.'

According to The Mirror, scientists at the University of Huddersfield found three in four of a group of rats they tested were resistant to the poisons.

Up to £6,000 a month is being spent at Westminster on pest control, a rise of 15 per cent in two years, according to reports

Scientists have warned that in parts of southern England, up to 70 per cent of rats could be resistant to poisons.

Richard
 Moseley, the British Pest Control Association's technical manager, told
 MailOnline that 'cases of resistance in rats have been known for 
decades'.

He said: 
'While the studies show that the resistant rat population is spreading, 
you can be assured our members have the skills and products to solve 
this problem.'

The 
resistant rats have the ability to multiply rapidly as the gestation 
period of rats is around 22 days and they reach sexual maturity by eight to 
12 weeks.

Mr Moseley 
said: 'Normal rats are being killed off by poison, so these resistant 
species are taking their place - it’s only natural that their numbers 
are expanding.'

In December last year MailOnline reported how West Berkshire Council was asking the Health and Safety Executive to change rules on how poison is used in a bid to tackle a plage of 'super rats' that were resistant to conventional poisons.

Homes in Berkshire, Oxford and Hampshire had reported increased numbers of the ‘super-rodent’ which is resistant to normal poisons and can transmit life-threatening diseases to humans and farm animals.

But wildlife experts feared that if stronger poisons were allowed to be used against the rat-threat it may harm innocent local wildlife.

Graham Chappell, from Rapid Pest Control in Newbury, who is contracted by West Berkshire Council, said: ‘It’s becoming more of an issue now simply because of the number of rats that are being seen.

‘They’ve also mutated genetically and are bred to be immune to standard poisons.

‘We have to start using different methods such as trapping and gassing, which can be less effective and more costly.’
