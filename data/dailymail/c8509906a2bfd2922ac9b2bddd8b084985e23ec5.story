Police found a body late on Saturday in a backyard bungalow belonging to a masked gunman who is accused of setting the residence on fire before shooting five members of a Southern California family, killing a father and his 4-year-old son.

An autopsy will determine whether the body is that of Desmond John Moses, 55, who investigators believe went on the early morning shooting rampage over a dispute with the victims, who live on the same property in front of him, Inglewood Police Lt. James Madia said.

Investigators believed Moses wore a dark cap and a white painter's mask when he entered the family's home around 4 a.m. and fired 10 times.

Horrific: Five people were shot, two of them fatally, when a man wearing a painter's mask opened fire on a home in Inglewood before setting it ablaze

Possible motive: Police say the gunman may have lived in the back home on the property, but was recently evicted

A manhunt for Moses will continue until the body is identified, he added.

Madia said Moses lived in the bungalow for 17 years, while the family lived in the front house for 8 years.

The 30-year-old father was shielding two of his children when he was shot, Police Chief Mark Fronterotta said, and his 28-year-old wife was shot in both legs but managed to carry the wounded 4-year-old out of the house.

Paramedics found her collapsed on the street.

The other victims included the couple's six-year-old son and a seven-year-old daughter, who was struck in the chest. An eight-year-old boy who was also inside the house was the only one to escape injury.

All the injured victims were rushed to University of California Medical Center, where the father died in surgery. The four-year-old boy was also pronounced dead from a gunshot wound to the head.

'The father was found draped over two of the children, shielding them,' Fronterotta said.

The six-year-old boy was listed in stable condition, while the mother and daughter were critical.

Victims: A 28-year-old woman was shot in the pelvis and knee while she carried her wounded daughter out of the house

Rapid response: A SWAT team arrived on the scene after getting reports that the shooter may still be inside the burning home

Inferno: Firefighters were kept from the burning duplex for fear that the suspect may have barricaded himself inside

Initially it was reported that the suspect set fire to the victims' house and the dwelling in the rear of the property after gunning down the family, but later police established that he set the buildings ablaze first. 

Police kept fire crews away from the 
burning home due to concerns that the gunman was still inside or hiding 
nearby in the bushes, KCAL reported.

But at around 8.30am, they were allowed to 
approach the residence and managed to extinguish the flames.

Five
homes in the immediate area have been evacuated and other residents 
were asked to stay away as officers scoured the neighborhood in search 
of the gunman.

Aftermath: Inglewood emergency personnel respond to the scene of the deadly shooting in Inglewood

Manhunt: Police have found the body of the man they believe carried out the attacks, but they will continue to search until it has formally been identified

The Los Angeles Times reported that the gunman had known the family for at least eight years, according to Capt. Tom Richards of the Los Angeles County Fire Department.

Neighbor Aileen Ramirez, 11, told the Times that she was awakened before dawn by 'really, really loud gunshots and screaming. Somebody was yelling: "Help me!" I ran outside with my mother and saw the house burning down,' Ramirez said.

Aileen’s brother, Yesualdo Ramirez, 20, described the children targeted in the attack as 'happy kids' who enjoyed playing soccer.

Judy Castellanos, whose daughter is 
related to the 30-year-old victim, described the suspected killer to the
Times as a 'really weird' and 'dangerous' recluse who would not let 
anyone into his home.

She said he lived in one of the three 
rental units on the property, but had not paid rent for years and was 
asked to leave by the end of the month.
