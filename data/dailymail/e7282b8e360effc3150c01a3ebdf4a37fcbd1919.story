More than fifty pink flamingos have been found dead in southern France, victims of freezing weather conditions that have gripped Europe over the past weeks.

Firemen who combed waters in Gruissan, in the Aude region, said the birds succumbed to the cold after being trapped in the frozen water and left unable to fly away.

The League for Protection of Birds (OPL) picked up some of the other fragile flamingos in the region to transport them to a bird park in Camargue in southern France.

Rare occurrence: The cold weather has sapped their energy reserves, preventing the birds from flying away from the perilously cold water

Francis Morlon, Director of the OPL, said: 'These birds have suffered from the cold wave. The ten days of cold have weakened them and so their energy reserves have reduced.

'And what happened was that, on Monday, we had winds of 120km/h and so the birds were not able to flee the peak of the cold and all the ponds of the region have frozen.

'It's pretty rare. Really, the last time we recovered so many flamingos was in 1985. After that, every year we catch young flamingos weakened by the cold, or who face other problems like food etc, but never on such a large scale.'

As the birds were being bandaged in black cloth and put into large cartons for transportation, firemen combed nearby ponds to look for other flamingos trapped in the ice, a task made difficult by the slippery ground and by the birds themselves who tried hard to get away.

Meanwhile, Serbia was struggling to keep its power system going after weeks of record-low temperatures in Europe that have snarled traffic, frozen rivers and challenged officials to step up outreach to the vulnerable homeless.

The Serb state power company said its system cannot hold on for much longer and authorities urged citizens to save electricity in an appeal aired on national television.

Europe's big freeze so far has claimed hundreds of lives, mostly of homeless people, while tens of thousands more remain trapped in remote villages in Bosnia and Serbia and other hard-hit areas.

Homeless people are queueing up for free rooms in an Austrian brothel after its owner said it would be unfair not to do everything he could during the current cold spell.

Peter Laskaris (above), owner of the Red Rooms Laufhaus in the capital Vienna, is offering 10 people a night a bed in his brothel, including a hot shower and a hot meal.

He said: 'We are not really doing much business in the current cold weather anyway and it is the school holidays - a lot of people are off away with their families.

'Lots of our rooms are empty and it seemed a shame not to use them for a good cause.'In these cold temperatures nobody should be left out on the streets.'

But he added: 'Other services are not included.'

In many European capitals, authorities 
have set up extra shelters for the homeless to help them survive the 
cold snap that has seen temperatures sink as low as -33F (-36C).

In Berlin, rescue vans loaded with food and clean sheets are picking up those in need and taking them to shelters.

'I witnessed a man laying on the street and people were passing by, not caring about him,' said Wolfgang Gerhard, a pastor who works for the Berlin city mission and drives one of its two rescue vehicles.

'And that's what moves me: that someone could die on a street and nobody calls an ambulance.'

The cold and snow have blocked roads, halted shipping on rivers and forced schools to close in many countries.

Massive ice floes have halted shipping on parts of the mighty Danube, Europe's main commercial waterway, which winds 2,860kilometres (1,777miles) from Germany to the Black Sea.

Authorities in Serbia plan to use explosives to break the ice to try to prevent flooding of the kind that hit Greece and Bulgaria on Monday and Tuesday, leaving dozens of homes under water and at least eight dead.

Elsewhere in the region, rescue services have been using helicopters to reached stranded people and deliver food to snowed-in regions.

TV stations showed images of people digging tunnels to get out of their homes in the village of Rubla in eastern Romania, where dozens of communities were left without electricity or water.

Some people said they were melting snow and drinking it because they couldn't get fresh water from frozen wells.

Used banknotes are being compressed into blocks and handed out to hard-up families to heat their homes during the current freezing weather in Hungary.

Cash taken out of circulation is shredded and reformed to make fuel for burning as temparatures plunge to minus 20 degrees in the eastern European country.

The nation's central bank said it took around five million Hungarian forints - worth £13,000 - to make a one kilogramme block.

Helping hand: Each block uses around five million Hungarian forints - worth £13,000 - in old notes

Around five tonnes of the recycled cash is now being handed out each week to charities, allowing families to save about 150 pounds a month on their fuel bills, central bank spokesman Barnabas Ferenczi said.

He added: 'Every year, we withdraw about a quarter of all banknotes from circulation or around 200 billion forints.

'Until now, we hand been incinerating them, but because they burn so well we are now reproccessing them as fuel.

'This process is done in a secure facility, but because the banknotes are still legal tender and staff are surrounded by billions of forints, we have issued them all with overalls without pockets.'
