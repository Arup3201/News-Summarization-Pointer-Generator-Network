A man has died after allegedly falling through the gap between two New York City subway cars before being being truck by the fast-moving train.

The tragic incident happened on the southbound 6 train between the 59th and the 51st street stations in Manhattan’s Upper East Side.

Police initially said he had not been killed, but friends later revealed he had in fact passed away.

Confusion: Passengers are seen looking out of the window on the stopped train to see what had happened

It is also unknown whether he had tried 
to commit suicide or whether it was an accident, but friends told 
MailOnline it is not believed he was trying to take his life.

The incident left commuters stuck in the subway train for nearly two hours without power.

When the train left 59th street at about 4pm, packed with commuters, the driver said over the intercom system that the train was going to drive express to 42nd street instead of stopping at 51st.

A few seconds later as the train sped through the tunnel, it suddenly screeched to a halt, throwing passengers through the cars, some falling and screaming.

The driver told passengers that something had ‘activated the emergency brake’ and that it was being investigated.

Claustrophobic: The train's lights and air-conditioning system were switched off as commuters waited for an hour and a half

Questioning: Police officers stop commuters as the stream out of the train after being stuck for an hour and a half to ask questions about the incident

The train’s lights and 
air-conditioning system were switched off, leaving the packed train of 
commuters to wait for an hour and a half in the sweltering heat of 
train.

Passengers were seen draping their scarves and jackets over the handrails to relieve themselves from the intense heat.

MTA workers appeared outside the train, with one gesturing to passengers that someone had died.

Finally the train started up again, but passengers were told not to leave the train until police had investigated the issue. A NYDP detective was called to the scene.
