When it comes to most things it can be said that women wear the trousers and now we're doing it quite literally too.

The high street has witnessed sales of trouser suits soar by 157 per cent after recent awards ceremonies such as the Baftas and the Oscars, where fashion's finest were championing the trend.

Style icons Cara Delevingne, Kourtney Kardashian, Madonna and Ellen Degeneres have been embracing the look since the start of the New Year and the red carpets were blanketed in ladies’ tuxes.

Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie kicked off the red carpet trend with his and hers’ tuxedos at the Baftas, followed by Pharrell Williams and wife Helen Lasichanh at the Oscars while Amy Adams turned heads in a striking scarlet ensemble at the awards luncheon.

Trouser suits also featured strongly on the catwalks of New York, Milan, Paris and London during fashion week - as seen at Armani and Jasper Conran - as well as being the favoured attire of front row fashionistas.

Androgynous dressing is back on the style agenda but that doesn’t mean you have to look manly.

'Clean-lined suits with cuts in the right places can look feminine and flattering as shown at Jil Sander,  Tods and Versace,' said fashion blogger Lydia Faye Jones.

Although the look has been a celebrity favourite on the red carpet, it has crossed over into everyday wear with sales of plain black and navy trouser suits up by 157 per cent along with white shirts increasing by 105 per cent at Debenhams.

It was during the 1920s that the trouser suit was first seen on a growing band of Brits who adopted a masculine style, including pantsuit, hats, and even canes and monocles.

In 1996, Yves Saint-Laurent introduced his Le Smoking, an evening pantsuit for women that mimicked a man's tuxedo, firmly putting the trend on the fashion map.

Slimane's debut collection for Saint Laurent included many updated takes

Speaking about the trend, a spokesperson for Debenhams said: 'Trouser suits are definitely back.

'Sales have been 
up since January making 2014 officially the year of the trouser suit. 
Women are enjoying wearing clothes with a masculine edge, but which also
 highlight the female figure with clever tailoring.

'The trouser suit knows no age limit with admirers of the combo 
ranging from Cara and Kourtney to Angelina and Joan Collins. It's a 
must-have for fashion followers all around the globe, with sales in 
overseas stores also on the rise.'
