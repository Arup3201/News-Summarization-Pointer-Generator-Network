Inheritance tax should only be paid by the ‘rich’, George Osborne has said – in a new hint at the content of the Tory manifesto.

The Chancellor suggested that the Conservatives are set to repeat the pledge made at the last election to cut the unpopular death duty.

In 2010, David Cameron promised to raise the inheritance tax threshold to £1million, but has been blocked from introducing the policy by the Liberal Democrats as part of the Coalition agreement.

The Chancellor also repeated his insistence that – contrary to Labour claims – he has ‘no plans’ to raise VAT.

Inheritance tax has remained unreformed for years and critics say that, while it was designed for the rich, hundreds of thousands of people with relatively modest properties have been dragged into the scope of the levy.

The tax is now charged at 40 per cent of the value of any estate above £325,000.

In an interview with the Sunday Times, Mr Osborne said: ‘David Cameron has made it clear, as have I, that we believe inheritance tax is a tax that should be paid by the rich and we will set out our further approach closer to the election.’

Labour has repeatedly claimed that Mr Osborne is considering a post-election hike in VAT to pay for a £7billion income tax cut promised by Tories, for which no funding has yet been identified.

But Mr Osborne insisted: ‘I couldn't have been clearer that our plans do not involve tax increases, including VAT, because our plans involve cutting public expenditure and saving on welfare budgets.’

Labour’s Treasury spokesman Chris Leslie criticised the proposed inheritance tax reforms.

‘The Tories are making more unfunded promises which add up to billions of pounds a year,’ he said. ‘These could only be paid for by even deeper cuts to public services or tax rises on working people.

‘George Osborne has still failed to rule out another Tory VAT rise. He simply says he has no plans to raise VAT, but that's exactly what the Tories said before the last election – a few weeks before the Tories raised VAT.

‘Labour will cut taxes for working people with a lower 10p starting rate – and we've said exactly how we'll pay for it.’
