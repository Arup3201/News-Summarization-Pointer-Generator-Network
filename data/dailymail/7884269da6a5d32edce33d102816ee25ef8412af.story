The amazing Bethany Hamilton already proved she's unstoppable when she realized her dream of becoming a pro-surfer after losing her arm in a shark attack as a teenager.

And now she's back on the board - at six months' pregnant. 

The 25-year-old was seen riding the waves off a beach in Kauai, Hawaii alone with her baby bump on show in an athletic bikini.

She appeared relaxed and happy, greeting fellow beach-goers at the popular surfing spot.

Last month, Bethany and husband Adam Dirks revealed they were expecting their first child together. 

It was the announcement of a change of pace for the sporty couple who last year competed in season 25 of The Amazing Race - a show which features eleven teams of two in a race around the world to win $1million. They came in third place.

The couple, who married in August 2013, informed fans about their baby boy with a pre-recorded interview from their Hawaii home.

At 13, Bethany lost her arm, and suffered 60 per cent blood loss in a shark attack while surfing off the coast of Kauai. Four years later, she was competing professionally

The pro-surfer is also a Christian motivational speaker and travels the country telling her inspiring story

Bethany has said that she will get 'creative' to help her raise a child with one arm. On her injury, she added: 'I kind of forget about it'

In the interview last month, she said: 'In baby terms I'm about 22 weeks, which is about halfway there.

'It's been a pretty crazy last four months finding out that we're going to be parents. Life's kind of going to be changing and kind of just started to prep for bringing a new little being into the world.'

She added: 'It's really exciting. I've been surfing throughout my whole pregnancy. I plan to surf as long as I can.'

'Once the belly's pretty big maybe just like mellow it out and spend more time swimming and just enjoying the ocean and doing other activities,' she admitted about slowing down on the surfing.

So will raising a child with one arm be difficult? 'I'll figure it out and be creative,' said Bethany.

'Motherhood with one arm, I kind of think about it,' she continued. 'I kind of forget that I have one arm, a squirming baby and changing diapers and just me  could be really challenging but I think how I live life now I just adjust and adapt to different things and I'll find my own ways to take care of the baby.'

Bethany's story became an inspiration to many after she wrote about it in the book, Soul Surfer: A True Story of Faith, Family, and Fighting to Get Back on the Board.

The book was made into a movie with Dennis Quaid and Carrie Underwood in 2011. Anna Sophia Robb  portrayed Bethany.

At 13, Bethany lost her arm, and 60 per cent of the blood in her body, surfing off the coast of Kauai when she was attacked by a shark.

She did not let the incident impact her dreams of surfing, however, and she began competing professionally four years later in 2007. 

In 2010, she was the twentieth ranked woman among surfers.

She is also a motivational speaker and tours the country telling her inspiring story.

Bethany cites her Christian faith as one of her biggest inspirations to pursuing her surfing career.

And her Christian youth minister husband Adam also shares her beliefs.

'She's pregnant!' Adam pointed to his surfer wife's bump as he revealed their 'baby boy is due in early June'
