Amish mafia revealed by Discovery Channel reality show of the same name

Focuses on Lebanon Levi and his three ‘foot soldiers’ who carry out his dirty work

'Mafia' deals with adultery, extortion, accidents, and financial issues within close-knit religious community

Within the rolling hills of rural Pennsylvania, sects of Amish live out a seemingly modest existence, caring for their families and living lives of deep religious significance.

But beneath the veil of their seemingly idyllic lifestyle lies something much more sinister – an Amish mafia, which serves as vigilante justice for the community and exposes infidelity, blackmail, and extortion plots.

The provocative information has been revealed by Discovery Channel's upcoming reality show, 'Amish Mafia,' which focuses around the organization's leader and his three henchmen.

A secretive group of Amish mafia have been unveiled by Discoveryfor a new reality show

Lebanon Levi, left, is the Amish insider who holds the power and serves as protector of the community - for a price. They are seen busting an Amish bishop out for motel sex and have no tolerance for infidelity either

In one scene from the pilot episode, two 'mafia' members stake out a prominent Amish bishop who was asking a taxi driver to take him to see a prostitute.

The two men barge in on the bishop, camera in hand, to get photographic evidence of the bishop's sin. They then kindly let the woman cover up before letting her go on her way.

While an Amish woman explains the conservative traditions of the lifestyle – long dresses, muted colors, no being photographed, no complicated machinery – a man loads a machine gun.

This is the world of Lebanon Levi, a Mennonite who was never baptized, and therefore never a member of the church. Because of this, Levi is able to live in both communities, living amongst his people but also seeing that his idea of justice is served.

'Levi is a man who straddles both worlds,' the show's executive producer, Dolores Gavin, explained to the New York Post earlier this month.

'He genuinely feels as though he is a help to the community, and yet he has a propensity for violence and intimidation.'

She said that it took she and others two years to gain the trust of the elusive vigilantes.

Gavin is most noted for her production work on reality shows like 'Ice Road Truckers,' 'Ax Men,' and 'Sons of Guns.'

She was not immediately available to speak with MailOnline, a Discovery Channel representative said.

The show opens with an ominous disclaimer, which reads: 'The Amish Church denies the existence of the Amish Mafia. To ensure the safety of innocent Amish, select re-enactments of events must be used.'

The show depicts the gang as a violent crew, although they are still religious in their peace-loving church. The Amish church denies the mafia exists at all

Because the Amish Mafia doesn't have direct dealing with the church, they do not have to operate within its jurisdiction.

They use cell phones, drive Cadillac SUVs, and tote guns to carry out what they believe is the law.

Jolin, a Mennonite, is described as 'military foot soldier' in the pilot episode, set to air December 12. Many Amish sects are wary of 'English' laws, and will not report crimes to recognized authority figures.

That leaves it to Levi and his cronies to seek justice for the meek and the mild.

The Mennonite division is slightly less strict than many Amish sects, which the show says allows him to do Levi's 'dirty work.'

In addition, Levi and his three mafia members – John, Jolin, and Alvin – cannot be punished by church elders. Their philosophy is an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

In the case of a woman whose buggy was destroyed by a reckless driver, Jolin took the matter into his own hands. He tracked the man who hit the Amish woman's buggy and fired a single shot through the empty car's window.

Some scenes- and body art - is more reminiscent of Fight Club than depictions of the Amish previously shown in popular culture

The owner was unharmed, but the message was clear.

Another time, Levi sent John and Jolin to stake out the house of a married Amish woman who was believed to have had an affair.

The man was trying to extort the married woman to have sex with him, because her own husband had left her, causing financial struggle.

Divorce is forbidden within the community, and a spouse must wait until their partner dies before re-marrying.

John and Jolin stopped the man, who was driving his buggy down the road, and confronted him on the street.

'You will not go back there,' Jolin said. 'Lebanon Levi will kick your a**.'

The two saw to it that the woman would be supported from funds from Levi.

The pilot does not explain why the gang are comfortable using modern conveniences like automobiles, cell phones, and cameras, which are typically shunned

But these men still have to answer to the local jurisdictions. The Lancaster County Police did not offer any comment regarding Levi's criminal record.

Levi is pictured in a 2009 mug shot. Though his charge and other vital information has been blackened out, Levi entered a guilty plea for his crime.

Another case from 2007 shows he negotiated another guilty plea for five separate charges.

Levi oversees the community's insurance, known as 'Amish Aid,' but is also in charge of the community's finances and keeping the general peace.

His three 'soldiers' also have lengthy criminal records. MailOnline's request for comment to the Lancaster Police Bureau to confirm their records was not immediately returned.

There is no explanation in the pilot as to why Levi and his gang are comfortable using modern conveniences like automobiles, cell phones, and cameras, which are typically shunned by conservative practicing Mennonites.

In fact, a disclaimer at the beginning admits that some of the show is actually reenactments - done to protect the identities of innocent Amish

It is also unclear why various members of the Amish and Mennonite communities agreed to be on camera, as it goes against their beliefs of appearing vain.

Some local Pennsylvania residents with deep interest in the Mennonite and Amish communities said that they had never heard of such a thing as the Amish mafia.

'My own view is this is trash TV,' Elizabethtown College professor Donald Kraybill told Lancaster Online.

'To call these shows documentaries is a fraudulent lie.' Kraybill has been a top researcher on the Amish's way of life.

'There is big money to be had,' he continued, 'and they pay these people big money to be on the show.'

He told Lancaster Online that some members of the community have indeed been charged with crimes, but that going so far as to say there is a vigilante mafia is overboard.

'I'm not saying Amish are perfect saints and walk on water,' he continued. 'But this [show] is a twisted portrayal of the Amish community.'

Lancaster County District Attorney Craig Stedman added that to his knowledge, there has not been a spike of crime in the Anabaptist community in reason years.

The show comes on the heels of TLC's 'Breaking Amish,' which has come under fire for deceiving viewers about the five Amish and Mennonite men and women it featured as they moved to New York.

In the finale, cast members were given the opportunity to come clean over their questionably Amish lifestyles – which, before the show, included modeling careers, skimpy clothes, divorce, and arrests.

However, many of them touted the fact that they were anything else but normal.

Amish Mafia premieres on Discovery Channel on December 12 at 9pm EST.
