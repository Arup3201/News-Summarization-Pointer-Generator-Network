President Obama made a secret pact with the Clintons where he agreed to endorse Hillary in a 2016 run for the White House - in exchange for Bill's seal of approval during his re-election campaign last year.

The explosive revelations are made in an exposé published this week on the Obama administration. It also claims that no love was lost between Bill Clinton and Obama before the deal was brokered.

According to campaign sources quoted in The Amateur by Edward Klein, Bill Clinton tried to have Hillary challenge Obama for the presidency during his last term.

The pact: Bill Clinton agreed to endorse Barack Obama during his second run for the White House... in return for the same favor for Hillary Clinton in 2016, according to an explosive new book

At a meeting in their home town of Chappaqua, New York, Bill complained that Obama was ineffective in the Oval Office, calling him 'incompetent' and an 'amateur', according to the New York Post.

Obama returned the hostile sentiment and had already frozen former president Clinton out of the Democratic campaign in 2008. 

However, the President's tactics reportedly changed when support dropped in 2012 and chief strategists advised that Bill Clinton's endorsement could give Obama a boost with dubious voters.

Subsequently at the 2012 Democratic 
National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, Bill Clinton 
officially nominated the sitting President for re-election.

Obama was nominated unanimously by the 5,556 delegates of the convention.

Clinton's 11th-hour support for Obama came with the condition that his wife would have the President's support in 2016.

However, the book then claims that Obama began to reconsidered this idea - enraging Bill Clinton.

The reported culmination of the behind-the-scenes wranglings was an on-camera love-fest nterview with Obama and Hillary Clinton when the Secretary of State stepped down in January.

The pair lavished compliments on one another as they gave a rare joint interview.

Obama said during the interview that he considers Mrs Clinton ‘a strong friend’ and she described their relationship as ‘very warm, close’.

More than anything, their camaraderie and grins appeared to show that time had healed the bitter rift from when they faced off in the Democratic primary leading up to the 2008 election.

The ongoing tension between Obama and Bill Clinton has been well-documented.

During the election campaign in 2012, Clinton said Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's business career was 'sterling' and criticized the Obama campaign's attacks on Romney's background at the private equity firm Bain Capital.

Around that time, he caused more headaches for the Obama administration when he said he favored the extension of all of George W Bush's tax cuts. Obama has campaigned on repealing the cuts for the richest Americans.

During the 2008 Democratic primary, Clinton made headlines for calling the premise of Obama's campaign, his opposition to the Iraq War, 'the biggest fairy tale I've ever seen'.

However, by the time it came to the Democratic convention four years later, former president Bill Clinton delivered a rousing, rollicking speech and an impassioned plea for Americans to vote.

The former occupant of the White House from 1993 to 2001 declared that Obama was ‘a man cool on the outside but burning for America on the inside’.

He went on: ‘A man who believes we can build a new American Dream economy driven by innovation and creativity, education and cooperation. A man who had the good sense to marry Michelle Obama.'
