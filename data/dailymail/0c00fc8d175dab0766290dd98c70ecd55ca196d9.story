A fridge-sized asteroid has crashed into the Moon, in the largest lunar collision with a space rock ever captured on video.

Incredible video footage has emerged of the spectacular fireball created as the asteroid impacted the Mare Nubium, a lava-filled basin on the moon.

Spanish astronomer Jose Maria Madiedo, a Professor at the University of Huelva, Britain's Royal Astronomical Society, witnessed the incident on September 11 last year, according to AFP reports.

He spotted the bright flash while operating two telescopes.

At one stage, the flare was almost as bright as the Northern Hemisphere's Pole Star, according to the RAS.

The flash would have been visible to the naked eye for anyone who was looking at the Moon at that moment in clear viewing conditions, the RAS said.

After the impact there was an afterglow that lasted a further eight seconds, which was the longest and brightest incident of its kind ever recorded.

'At that moment, I realised that I had seen a very rare and extraordinary event,' Madiedo told the RAS.

Two videos have captured the event, including one which features actual footage and another that was posted by the researchers, which includes computer-generated graphics that explain the event in great detail.

Madiedo's team estimate the asteroid hit the moon at about 61,000 kilometres an hour.

It was so fast,the rock turned to molten and vaporised, creating the flash and a crater 40 metres in diametre.

The impact energy was equivalent to an explosion of around 15 tonnes of TNT, more than triple the largest previously seen event, claimed by NASA in March 2013.

As a measure of comparison, the asteroid that hit Chelyabinsk, Russia, in February last year, is believed to have been about 20 metres wide, weighing 13,000 tonnes.

It is considered to have been at the lower end of medium-sized asteroids.

Madiedo and colleagues estimate the rock had a mass of around 400 kilograms, with a diameter of between 60 centimetres and 1.4 metres.

The team  of researchers estimate that asteroids of this size may strike Earth about 10 times more frequently than was initially thought.

However Earth is protected by its atmosphere and asteroids of this size burned up as meteors.

The Spanish observation is published in the RAS journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.
