The shoes that former Patriots player Aaron Hernandez was wearing when he allegedly murdered Odin Lloyd have mysteriously disappeared, it has been claimed.

Investigators  seized four pairs of white, size-13 Nike sneakers from the master bedroom of Hernandez's North Attleboro, Massachusetts mansion on June 18, 2013 - a day after Lloyd was found with six gunshot wounds on wasteland a mile away. Police also later returned to search the home on June 22.

Three other pairs of shoes, including a set of Nike Air Jordan XI Retro Lows, were photographed in Hernandez's basement 'man cave' but were not taken into evidence.

Prosecutors claim that the sole of the Nike Air Jordan XI Retro Low brand sneaker is similar to an unidentified shoe impression found near Lloyd's body. The Retro Lows had gone on sale just three weeks before the murder.

According to a search warrant affidavit, it wasn't until almost 18 months later that investigators noticed the three pairs of shoes in photographs as they prepared to go to trial.

However when they returned to the mansion to look for them, they had disappeared.

Jurors have not yet been told that the three other pairs of shoes found in the basement were overlooked.

University of New Hampshire law professor Michael McMann, who has been following the trial, told CNN: 'Jurors will wonder why didn't investigators seize the shoes at the same time they seized many other pieces of evidence from Hernandez's home.'

Jurors were this week shown evidence photographs from Hernandez's home in June 2013 - including pairs of sneakers neatly lined up against a wall. However these shoes were not taken into evidence

He added: 'If jurors determine investigators and prosecutors simply made a mistake in not seizing the shoes, it could damage the jurors' confidence in the case.  

Odin Lloyd's body was found at the industrial park around a mile from Hernandez's home in North Attleboro.

Lloyd had been dating Shaneah Jenkins, the sister of Hernandez's fiancee, Shayanna.

The medical examiner found 27-year-old Lloyd had been shot once in the back and six times in the front with the final two bullets fired as he lay face up. 

Prosecutors claim Hernandez and two friends, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, picked up Lloyd at his Boston home in the early hours of June 17, 2013, before driving him to the industrial park where his body was found later that day.

Wallace and Ortiz have also been charged with murder and will be tried separately. All three men have pleaded not guilty.

Prosecutors said security video from the cameras in Hernandez's home show him arriving with a gun hours before going to pick up Lloyd, and later revealed the Pats star, Ortiz and Wallace carrying items from the basement to the trunk of a rental car.

Hernandez's basement 'man cave' features a bar, screening room, trophy room and pool table complete with a New England Patriot's logo.

Earlier in the trial, Shaneah Jenkins, the sister of Hernandez's fiancée Shayanna, told how Lloyd and Hernandez would sometimes hole up there and smoke marijuana.

On Wednesday, Massachusetts State Troopers testified that a safe found in the closet of Hernandez's master bedroom contained a digital scale and a dish with marijuana residue.

A marijuana cigarette found near Lloyd's body contained traces of both his DNA and that of Hernandez, potentially placing both at the scene, Assistant District Attorney Patrick Bomberg has said.

Hernandez, 25, had a $41 million contract with the New England Patriots when he was arrested on murder and firearms charges. The team cut him hours later.

If convicted, Hernandez faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.

The former NFL star will face a second trial later this year on charges he killed two Cape Verdean men outside a Boston nightclub in 2012.

On Wednesday, Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh ruled that prosecutors may not call to the stand Hernandez's high school friend Robert Paradis.

Paradis testified when the jury was out of the courtroom that he had visited Hernandez in April 2013 at his condo in Los Angeles.

He said Hernandez told him he kept 'fire' or 'heat' under the seat of his car and indicated it was a .45-caliber weapon, the same as the murder weapon, which has never been found.

Paradis said that after Hernandez left the condo, Hernandez called back to ask him to check whether he had left 'it' in his bedroom.

Paradis opened a drawer, saw a black shirt wrapped around an object and lifted it up but never opened it. He said it felt like a gun.
