Two girls havebeen arrested over an alleged plot to kill teacher Alison Cray

Two girls have been arrested for allegedly plotting to kill a maths teacher at their school, just days after Ann Maguire was stabbed to death.

The girls, aged 14 and 15, were taken away by police to be questioned over the suspected knife plot to murder teacher Alison Cray at their 1,000 pupil school, in Wales.

The 15-year-old was also arrested for allegedly having a knife in her schoolbag and suspicion of making death threats at  Cwmcarn High School.

The
 girls were allegedly discussing maths teacher Mrs Cray when 
their conversation was overheard. Mrs Cray was described as 'very 
popular' with other pupils at the school.

Police have stressed no-one was hurt - and that the drama ended peacefully.

Police were called to Cwmcarn High School near Newport, South Wales, at lunchtime on Thursday - just three days after the brutal killing of Mrs Maguire in her Leeds school.

A police source said: 'The two pupils were overheard in class talking about what they were thinking about doing.

'A teacher was informed and the pupils were challenged. Police were called as a result.

'It was resolved by the time the police arrived at the school. No weapon was seen in the open but a check on a schoolbag discovered a knife which was taken away.'

A
spokesman added: 'Officers were called to Cwmcarn High School at 
approximately 11.54am on Thursday following concerns being raised about 
the behaviour of two pupils.

'Officers attended and arrested a 15-year-old girl from Newbridge and a 14-year-old girl from Risca.

'They have since both been released on police bail pending further enquiries.

'Nobody was harmed as a result of the incident, and the matter was resolved peacefully.'

Parents of children at the comprehensive school were last night sent a calming message from the headtacher.

Headteacher Mrs Jacquie Peplinski said: 'You may be aware that concerns were raised about a pupil in the school yesterday.

'Please be assured that that the concerns were dealt with swiftly. There was no risk to any staff or learner and the relevant support services were contacted as a precautionary measure.

'Cwmcarn High is a caring and safe environment and we are committed to everyone's safety. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns.'

A spokesperson for Caerphilly County Borough Council said: 'We can confirm that concerns were raised about two pupils at Cwmcarn High School yesterday which were swiftly dealt with by staff and Gwent Police.

'Support is now in place for both pupils and staff and we would like to assure parents that all appropriate steps were taken to respond effectively to the situation. We are now helping the police with their enquiries.'

The two girls were allowed home and will answer bail at a later date to their nearest police station after officers have made further investigations.

A decision will be made next week if the girls will be allowed back to school.

Teacher Alison Cray tonight praised the school for their handling of the suspected murder plot.Experienced maths teacher Miss Cray, 46, said: 'It was all handled before it got to me.

'I know very little about it. It all happened elsewhere and I wasn't directly involved at all.

'I've very lucky that I'm at Cwmcarn and that they have handled it so well. I've been working as normal and I'm fine.'

Miss Cray has been at the school for more than 10 years and is described as being 'very kind and caring' on pupils social network sites.

On the Rate My Teacher website, she is described as being 'awesome, fab and supportive.'
