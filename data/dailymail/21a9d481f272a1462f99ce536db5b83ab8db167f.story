England have overhauled their backline for
 Saturday's final Test against New Zealand in Hamilton with Kyle 
Eastmond and Manu Tuilagi reunited in the centres.

The
 experiment of playing Tuilagi on the wing has been abandoned after just
 one match, although head coach Stuart Lancaster insists it will be 
revisited in the future.

Making his
 first start since the autumn, the revitalised Chris Ashton returns in 
the number 14 jersey for the Waikato Stadium encounter.

Central Line: Manu Tuilagi will return to his favoured position when England meet New Zealand in Hamilton

Demoted: Luther Burrell (L) and Billy Twelvetrees have been sacrificed to make changes

The Billy Twelvetrees and Luther Burrell partnership that flourished throughout the RBS 6 Nations has been disbanded following the 28-27 defeat in Dunedin that completed a series triumph for the All Blacks.

Instead, Eastmond and Tuilagi have been offered the stage to reproduce the fireworks that lit up Eden Park in the first Test in a selection Lancaster insists is based on form.

Twelvetrees has paid for his erratic display at the Forsyth Barr Stadium with Lancaster admitting it was a 'big step' for him to play his first match since May 3 in that game.

Fitness was an issue for Twelvetrees having been sidelined by an ankle injury for six weeks, and while he will be given another chance at a later date, there is a sense that England are losing patience with the Gloucester playmaker.

'This is a reflection of us feeling that the centre partnership worked better in first Test than in he second,' said Lancaster, who has picked Burrell on the bench.

Diving in: Chris Ashton will take over Manu Tuilagi's place on the wing against New Zealand

'We are still finding out which players can and can't really deliver at the highest level.

'We've had a good chance to look at Billy during the course of the season.

'Kyle's had one opportunity and he's taken it. Now's the right time to give him a second chance.

'Billy wasn't that far off it at the weekend, but when I look at the two games I thought Kyle edged him.'

 Farrell's tour-ending knee problem means Freddie Burns, another 
standout player at Eden Park, starts at fly-half with Ben Youngs holding
 off a strong challenge from Lee Dickson in the absence of 
shoulder-injury victim Danny Care.

In a spin: England coach Stuart Lanacster denies that his seven personnel changes are excessive

'Freddie played well in the first 
Test and the challenge for him is to back that up with a comparable 
performance,' Lancaster said.

Following a fine display in Tuesday's 
38-7 victory over the Crusaders, Danny Cipriani has been chosen ahead of
 Stephen Myler to provide specialist cover at 10.

Lancaster admits he
 made the decision on the strength of Cipriani's game management at 
Christchurch's AMI Stadium as the once-troubled Sale playmaker continues
 his climb back up the pecking order.

'I was really pleased with 
Danny's 45 minutes against the Crusaders,' said Lancaster, who admitted 
Myler had been a victim of the fixture congestion that marred 
preparations for the first Test.

'I needed to see Danny start and 
needed to see whether he could control and run a game as well as do the 
other bits and pieces. I thought he did that really well.

Ballast: Billy Vunipola will provide physicality and intensity as part of England's front three

'The decision to pick Danny was only made after the game. I wanted to have a chance to sleep on it and look at it overnight.'

Youngs
 was disappointing in the first Test, but Lancaster has been pleased 
with the half-back generalship he has displayed while Care has sat out 
training.

'I get the sense that Ben is approaching the player who 
played in November 2012 - he's shown that sort of character so that's 
why we're starting with him,' Lancaster said.

Hooker Dylan Hartley, 
lock Courtney Lawes and number eight Billy Vunipola return to freshen up
 the pack with Rob Webber, Joe Launcbury and Ben Morgan dropping to the 
bench.

Geoff Parling continues in the second row with Lancaster describing him as England's 'outstanding forward' in the series to far.
