Ten years ago, Steve Harmison was at Downing Street celebrating England’s famous Ashes victory over Australia. He was the world’s best bowler. 

On Tuesday night, he will be at Woodhorn Lane football ground in his hometown of Ashington, a rookie manager making his dugout debut in the Ebac Northern League.

It is all a far cry from those heady days of 2005 when Harmison was a guest of the Prime Minister and one of the most famous sportsmen in the country.

Former England bowler Steve Harmison has been named as manager of non-League Ashington

Harmison played a key role in helping England win the Ashes ten years ago

But football has always been his first love. His dad, Jimmy, played for Yeovil Town in the Conference and his brother, James, is now on the books of Bedlington Terriers.

Growing up in the former mining town of Ashington – home to Jackie Milburn and World Cup winners Jack and Bobby Charlton – he was surrounded by footballing folklore from a young age.

Harmison himself was a player under Newcastle United’s current boss, John Carver, at the club’s school of excellence during the early Nineties.

In fact, the sight of the former Test star at St James’ Park – where he was honoured with a seat for life following the Ashes triumph – or on the touchline of a Northern League ground is very much a familiar one in these parts.

What will be unfamiliar, however, is watching the 36-year-old patrol his technical area when ninth-tier Ashington AFC take on Bishop Auckland this evening.

The club's average gate is 200 but 500 are expected for the unveiling of Harmison, whose part-time role pays a token wage to cover expenses and will involve at least two weeknight training sessions and Saturday matches.

But Harmison – who has the full support of wife, Hayley, and their four children – believes he has a long-term future in the game and insists his appointment is no publicity stunt.

‘Anyone who knows me understands that football has always been first,’ he tells Sportsmail ahead of his venture into management.

‘Northern League football is something I have watched since I was old enough to walk - not many people have watched more non-league games than I have.

Harmison was known as the Ashington Express during his playing days and is a Newcastle fan

Harmison has taken the surprise move to go into football management following his retirement from cricket

‘I played until I was 16 at Ashington but had to stop to concentrate on cricket. But because of my family – my dad, brother and uncles all played – I’ve always been around football dressing-rooms.

‘This opportunity presented itself and it felt right. The club has solid foundations but they needed a change with some fresh ideas and I’ve got a fantastic team with me (coaches Ian Skinner and Lee Anderson).

‘I can assure you one thing, this is anything but a publicity stunt. We are in it for the right reasons. It certainly isn’t for financial gain.

‘The club has so much going for it and we want to be part of that. I know the league and I know what’s going on. We’re in a bit of a relegation fight but I’m excited by it.

‘Who knows what the future holds for me? I’m going to start my coaching badges this summer. By that point I will have a better understanding of management and the experience of a few months in the job.’

Harmison’s own playing days are behind him. Indeed, he says the club wouldn’t have a strip big enough to fit him now.

But already he has been on the phone using his contacts to bring in some new faces. So what sort of manager will Harmison be?

‘If you have played a professional sport at the top level then those core values transfer – a winning mentality and demanding certain standards,’ he says.

‘I was always different in my professional career as a cricketer. If I didn’t agree with something then I would speak up, I was my own man. I will be honest with the players and will challenge them.

‘I want to build a team. I want people to come back and watch us, to make it as happy a club as it can be. This is my hometown and this means a lot to me, I want to make a difference.’

Harmison breaks off as his four kids return from school. He has tea to make and then a round of phone calls to see which players are available.

‘I’ve only got about eight fully fit players at the moment,’ he says. ‘I’ve had a text from Michael Vaughan asking “which position do you want me to play?”.’

While Vaughan may joke, Harmison is deadly serious when it comes to his new career. 

So who are Ashington?

A non-league football club who play in the Northumberland town of Ashington, located about 15 miles north of Newcastle. Founded in 1883, they are known as 'The Colliers' and play in the Northern Football League Division One.

What level is that?

It is level nine on the English league pyramid - for this part of the country, the Premier League is level one, then Championship, League One, League Two, Conference, Conference North, Northern Premier League, Northern Premier League Division One North and then Ashington's league. They pit themselves against the likes of Bedlington Terriers, Whitley Bay and Sunderland Ryhope Community Association.

Where do they play?

At Woodthorn Lane, which has a capacity of about 2,000. The club moved there in 2008 and their record attendance for a competitive fixture is 904 for a league game with Darlington in March 2013.

What are their colours?

Black and white stripes, similar to Newcastle United's.

Have they ever won anything?

They have twice won the league below their present one and are 10 times winners of the Northumberland Senior Cup, the latest coming in 2013. Their furthest run in the FA Cup came way back in 1926-27, when they played Nottingham Forest in the third round.
