Jenson Button was pleasantly surprised by McLaren's performance at the Malaysian Grand Prix despite the fact both he and Fernando Alonso failed to finish the race.

The McLaren pair began the race with Button 17th and Alonso 18th but were involved in a battle in the middle of the pack for the first half of the race.

Alonso was forced to retire, though, after being called in by his team after 21 laps while Button lasted double the amount of time as his team-mate.

But Button was happy to see his team challenging again after a lonely Australian Grand Prix where he could only manage to nurse the car home.

He told Sky Sports: 'I would rather this way around (being forced to retire) than get to the end and be nowhere.

'We were quicker than the Force India. The Sauber was there and the Lotus wasn't that much quicker. It was a nice surprise but it was also good to see where our strengths and weaknesses were compared to the rest of the cars.

'It was interesting to race with other people and a little bit unexpected. It wasn't so bad, it was just a little bit messy with the pit stop and safety car.'
