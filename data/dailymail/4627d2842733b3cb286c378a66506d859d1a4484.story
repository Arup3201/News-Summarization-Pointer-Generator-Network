Often seen as the father of modern industry, car maker Henry Ford implemented an idea that revolutionised manufacturing.

He launched the modern assembly line in a factory in a suburb of Detroit to speed up motor production.

Ford's River Rouge plant in Detroit, Michigan, went on to become the largest factory in the world.

Ford produced a standard model, the Model T Ford. A new Model T Ford cost less than $300 in the mid-1920s.

By 1929, more than 26 million cars were registered in the U.S.

During the 1920s, about $1 billion a year was spent on the construction of a national network of highways.

The automobile industry also caused other industries such as steel, rubber, leather and paint to grow rapidly.

Mark 
Evernden, of Sotheby's, said: 'The Kettle Lakes Ranch, located in the 
Municipal District of Foothills, includes a 5,000 sq ft home on 97 
hectares of land, which was owned 25 to 30 years ago by the infamous 
Ford family of Henry Ford heritage.

'There has not been a property to my knowledge of single-family or country residential of that value in the Calgary area.

'It's tucked up in the hills and there's a couple of private lakes there.

'There was a full development in play but the MD wouldn't approve it because of the lay of the land and the damage it would cause to the natural part of it.

'It was supposed to be called Fordville Estates as a full country residential development.'

The lavish estate boasts imported kitchen cabinetry from South Carolina, granite counters, exposed wood beams from Alberta Graineries, stone archways and a sun room with views of the eye-catching mountain range.

Promotional material for the listing says 'rarely does a property this rich in history, natural scenery, unparalleled views with private, wide open spaces, come to market.'

It's nestled in the heart of the Alberta Foothills, just beyond the majestic Rocky Mountains.

Access is through a private gate, following a winding road through a covered bridge.

'One of the crown jewels here is this luxurious 2-storey masterpiece, built by Gallagher Homes. From the exquisite exterior stonework, to the opulent indoor living space this is an extremely well-built home,” says the marketing material.

 horses, several other out-buildings, countless trees and kettle lakes 
left over by a once retreating glacier, flower and rock garden
