With its bizarrely articulated long neck, this odd-looking creature almost looks like something out of the twisted imagination of Alien creator H.R. Giger.

But it is actually a real insect, native to Madagascar, and it is known as a giraffe weevil.

From its long legs to smaller body the unusual shaped critter is a surreal echo of its much larger namesake.

Unbe-weevil-ble: The incredible giraffe weevil of Madagascar which, with it's long articulated neck, looks almost like something from the imagination of Swiss surrealist painter H.R. Giger

Peering about: Unlike the giraffe the bug's neck is not to help it reach for food but is for aggressive combat with other giraffe weevils to win over a female

But unlike the giraffe the bug's neck is not to help it reach for food but is for aggressive combat with other giraffe weevils to win over a female.

The necks of the males are typically two to three times the length of those of females, and are also used for nest building.

Most of the creatures' bodies are covered with a distinctive red shell covering the wings. Despite their fierce look, they are not dangerous to humans.

Though it is not listed as threatened or endangered not much is known about the giraffe weevil, which was only discovered in Madagascar in 2008.

This specimen was photographed by Russian wildlife photographer Nikolay Sotskov, 29, who couldn't believe his eyes when he spotted it on a leaf while in the Indian Ocean island nation.

Madagascar split from India around 88million years ago, allowing plants and animals on the island to evolve in relative isolation.

Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90 per cent of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth.

However, the island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population.

'I like photographing animals as despite being one of the hardest to capture they are still the most fascinating,' he said.

'And this is the strangest insect I have ever seen. The giraffe weevil is not considered to be endangered but not much known about it.

'The enormous neck is two to three times longer in males than in females and is used for fighting. They also have red bodies to warn off competition.

'Even though they look like they could bite they are not harmful to humans as they only eat leaves.

'I don't think I'll ever see another bug this strange so I was really pleased to photograph it.'
