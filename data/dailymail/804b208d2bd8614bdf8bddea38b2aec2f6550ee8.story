More than 100 firefighters are battling to save an historic mansion house hotel from a huge blaze as dozens of guests have been evacuated.

Residents and staff were led to safety from the recently refurbished Crathorne Hall Hotel in Yarm, North Yorkshire, after the fire broke out at around 10am.

Eighteen fire engines were called to the 4* hotel after smoke was seen billowing from the roof. 

A spokeswoman from Hand Picked Hotels, which owns Crathorne Hall Hotel, said: 'The fire broke out in a wing of the hotel and has been confined there.

'No-one was hurt and all the staff and guests have been evacuated.'

The hotel has 37 bedrooms, all of which were recently renovated, according to the hotel's own website. Lord Crathorne, whose family used to own Crathorne Hall, still lives in the hotel grounds and saw the fire as it raged this morning. 

Fire crews tackle a blaze at the historic and recently restored country house of Crathorne Hall Hotel as a fire breaks out in the building. It has played host to politicians, royalty and socialites over the decades

Crathorne Hall overlooks the Leven Valley on the edge of the Yorkshire Moors, and is believed to be one of the most recently built country halls in the UK.

Set in 15 acres of private grounds, the hotel has been awarded four Red Stars - placing it among the top 200 hotels in the UK and Ireland.

English actress and singer songwriter Minnie Driver stayed there while filming Who Do You Think You Are for the BBC last year.

The blaze ripped through the historic mansion's roof, with flames tearing through the newly refurbished rooms.

The fire could be clearly seen through the property's windows. The hall overlooks the Leven Valley on the edge of the Yorkshire Moors, and is believed to be one of the most recently built country halls in the UK

Lord Crathorne said he had 'an awful lump in the throat' as he watched smoke billowing from the roof of the wing where he and brother David grew up.

He said: 'I went up there when I saw a fire engine and ambulance go past my house and it looked very bad.

'In terms of the building, it's pretty devastating but the main thing is that no-one seems to have been hurt or lost their life.

'The last thing I wanted to do this morning was get in the way, so I kept my distance. But from what I could see, it seemed pretty bad. 

'It looked absolutely devastating, to be honest - like the whole roof had gone.

North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue service said that twelve appliances have been called to the incident, and Cleveland Fire Brigade are assisting by sending four appliances to the hall, along with a hydraulic platform

Firefighters from North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue service and Cleveland Fire Brigade fought to try to stop the fire from spreading to the main part of the building

Lord Crathorne, whose family used to own Crathorne Hall, still lives in the hotel grounds and saw the fire as it raged this morning

'Apparently the firefighters were battling to make sure it didn't get to the main part of the building.'

Lord Crathorne said the fire was in the right wing, where lots of the services and kitchens are housed.

'That wing is where my brother and I grew up,' he said, sadly. 'It was the nursery wing, where we had a wonderful nanny who David and I adored.'

Lord Crathorne has lived in Crathorne House, in the grounds of Crathorne Hall, since the historic hall was sold in 1977.

He was last in the hotel on September 12 when 36 family and friends threw a surprise 75th birthday party for him.

Parts of the historic house collapsed as the blaze ripped through the roof  - despite the best efforts of more than 100 firefighters called to the scene

He said: 'It's a wonderful building. When it was built in 1903-6, it was the largest house built in Edwardian England.

'It's massively important architecturally and a very large building. When we lived there, it had 115 rooms and 45 bedrooms.

'I just feel great sadness for everyone involved and all the wonderful people who run that hotel so well.

'I think the damage will be tremendously bad, I'm afraid, but when you think of other historic buildings which have suffered even worse damage,

they have been restored and Crathorne Hall will be too. 

'It's a sad moment, but the main thing is there has been no loss of life.' 

North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue service said that twelve appliances have been called to the incident, and Cleveland Fire Brigade are assisting by sending four appliances to the hall, along with a hydraulic platform. 

A spokesperson for the North Yorkshire brigade said: 'We had report of smoke coming from the roof space and dispatched a crew to investigate.

'Crews on the ground requested more appliances and 12 are currently there, or on route to the hall.'

Northumbrian Water has advised people in the area that they may experience discoloured supply.
