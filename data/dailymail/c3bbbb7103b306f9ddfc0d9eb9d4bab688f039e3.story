Crystal Palace have made a £1.8million offer for Palermo left back Achraf Lazaar. 

The 22-year-old Morocco international can also play on the left wing.

Neil Warnock is keen to add a couple of new signings to his squad as he looks to avoid Palace being relegated to the Championship.

Lazaar joined Palermo from Varese in the summer of 2014 and cemented his place in the side almost straight away. 

He made his debut for Morocco in May against Mozambique, and has played six times for his country.

Palace have also put in a £6m bid for Swansea striker Bafetimbi Gomis in an attempt to add more firepower to their side in their quest for Premier League survival.
