A £1.75billion Spanish submarine project has run aground after officials realised that the vessel is more than 70 tonnes too heavy - because an engineer put a decimal point in the wrong place.

A former Spanish official has described the mistake, which has led to fears that the submarine might not resurface if sent to sea, as 'fatal'.

The Isaac Peral, the first in a new class of diesel electric submarines, was almost complete when the problem was noticed.

Too heavy: The Isaac Peral, a new, Spanish-designed submarine is more than 70 tons too heavy, and officials fear if it goes out to sea, it will not be able to surface. Officials are pictured next to the engine of the vessel last November

Spain will now pay US Navy contractor Electric Boat £9million over three years to assess the issue and carry out the work required to correct it, according to the Spanish Defence Ministry.

Rafael Bardaji, former director of the Office of Strategic Assessment at Spain's Defense Ministry said that officials will review options suggested by Electric Boat.

But he said the preference has been to extend the length of the submarine’s hull, perhaps by 5 to 6 meters, to increase buoyancy.

Otherwise, the weight of the 2,200 tonne submarine would have to be reduced, and he said the Spanish Navy would not want to compromise features such as the combat system or an air-independent propulsion system.

Experts: Electric Boat, the company who will help the Spanish rectify the problem, helped to build the Astute class attack submarine, pictured, for the British Navy in 2003

Electric Boat, the primary contractor for the U.S. Navy’s fleet of nuclear submarines, accepted the contract through a foreign military sales agreement between the American Navy and the Spanish Defense Ministry, the U.S. Naval Sea Systems Command announced this week.

The submarine project has cost the Spanish some £1.75billion so far. But what exactly are they getting for their money with the SSK submarine:

Electric Boat, a division of General Dynamic Corp., has helped other countries with their submarine programs.

It began assisting with development of the Astute-class nuclear attack submarine for the British Royal Navy in 2003, and it is working under another foreign military sales agreement on Australia’s Collins class of submarines.

The 233ft long submarine will carry a 
crew of 32, along with eight special forces troops, and weapons systems 
for surface and anti-submarine warfare.

The Defense Ministry said technical problems are normal for projects of this scale.

It
 said in a statement: 'The technology challenges that these programs 
face during development are much more than simple calculations.

'All
 the major military programs, especially submarines, have experienced 
delays and often have required the support of a technology partner.'

Mr
 Bardaji added: 'Apparently somebody in the calculations made a mistake 
in the very beginning and nobody paid attention to review the 
calculations.'

The Isaac Peral, named after a 19th 
century Spanish submarine designer, is one of four vessels in the class 
that are in various stages of construction. The country has invested 
about £1.75billion in the program.

The
 first vessel was scheduled to be delivered in 2015 but the Spanish 
state-owned shipbuilder, Navantia, has said the weight problems could 
cause delays of up to two years.
