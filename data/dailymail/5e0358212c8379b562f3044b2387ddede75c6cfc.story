A toddler and a baby were trapped in a car wreck for up to nine hours beside their dead mother after a crash on the NSW south coast.

Jacqui Britton, 33, from Tathra near Bega died when her car hit a tree and rolled down an embankment on Monday morning.

She wasn't found until the evening after her husband went to Bega police about 6.30pm to say he hadn't been able to contact his wife since mid-morning and she hadn't returned home with their two children.

Ms Britton's sister Emma Britton posted a desperate message to Facebook trying to locate Ms Britton on Monday afternoon after realising she was missing.

Jacqui Britton, 33, from Tathra died when her car hit a tree and rolled down an embankment on Monday

A family member posted a message on Facebook asking if anyone had seen during the day

Police started a search and about an hour later were notified about a car on its roof on Tathra Road.

Jacqui Britton was found dead, still in the driver's seat, with her four-month-old and two-year-old daughters in the back seat alive with minor injuries. The family dog was also in the car. 

Emma Britton went out searching for her sister and came across police at the tragic scene of the accident.

'My heart is broken, she was my best friend,' Ms Britton told Daily Mail Australia.

'She was a beautiful person, a beautiful mother, the most fun person.

'She was bossy and I loved her.'

Emma Britton said the victim's husband Ryan Dunning was on his way to Sydney where his baby daughter had been flown to undergo medical tests to check for lasting injuries.

'He's a mess,' she said.

'The older [daughter] is fine, but the baby is having scans.'

Jacqui Britton and her husband had been married for about seven years and had moved back to Tathra one year ago, after living in Canberra where Ms Britton worked at the Australian Medical Association.

Mr Britton's four-month-old and two-year-old daughters were trapped alive in the back seat for nine hours

'They were very happily married, it's a tragedy,' Emma Britton said.

Jacqui Britton was born and raised in Tathra.

'The whole community knows her,' she said.

'I know my community will come together for her, that's what we do down here.'

Friends have set up a memorial fund for her family. Donations can be made to the Jacqui Britton Dunning Memorial Fund (BSB: 112 879. Account number: 493 962 750).

Ms Britton's uncle, who did not wish to be named, said the family was shocked by the tragedy.

The woman's husband went to Bega police about 6.30pm on Monday to say he hadn't been able to contact his wife since mid-morning and she hadn't returned home with their two children 

'They're not doing real well at the moment, they're just trying to gather and come to terms with the fact that it's true,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 

Detective Superintendent Peter O'Brien said it was raining around the time of the crash.

'Inquiries at this stage indicate that she's either over corrected or lost control somehow,' Det Supt Peter O'Brien said.

'There was also a dog found in the wreckage. Whether the dog was a distraction, we don't know.

'She was at the local pool and was going home. It's a very sad story.'

A local said  the embankment where the car crash was covered in bushes, which would have concealed the car

A local told the Bega District News that the embankment where the car crashed was covered in bushes, which would have concealed the car for hours.

The children were taken to Bega District Hospital for observation, with the youngest later flown to Sydney for further medical attention.

Meanwhile a German tourist has died after coming off a skateboard and sliding into the path of a truck in the NSW Illawarra region.

The 29-year-old was skateboarding down the Barrengarry Mountain in Kangaroo Valley on Monday morning when he fell off his board and was hit by a truck coming up the hill.

He died in hospital.

The 59-year-old truck driver was breath tested and delivered a negative result.
