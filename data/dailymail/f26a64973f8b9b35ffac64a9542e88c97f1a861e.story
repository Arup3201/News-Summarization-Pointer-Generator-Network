The boss of the Morrisons supermarket chain has slammed Britain's educational system claiming many school leavers who turn up at his stores asking for jobs can't spell or add up.

Dalton Philips, 45, said he was concerned that UK schools were falling behind those in other countries and failing to teach basic numeracy and literacy skills.

Last month it emerged that British teenagers had dropped out of the top 20 rankings in maths, science and reading for the first time and now lag behind those from countries such as Vietnam, Shanghai and Poland.

Worrying: Morrisons boss Dalton Philips claims many school leavers who turn up at his stores asking for jobs can't spell or add up and he says it's holding them back. He's urged more people to take up apprenticeships

Mr Philips told the Daily Mirror: 'I worry about our schools system. When young people come on to our apprenticeship schemes we have to do remedial literacy and numeracy work with them and it's holding them back.

'I don't know where it's gone wrong. I would love to see young people proud to join an apprentice scheme and wear it as a badge of honour.

'University isn't for everyone and we need to give more encouragement to those who choose an apprenticeship.'

The UK is now ranked 26th out of 65 countries and major economic regions by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

Falling behind: British teenagers have dropped out of the top 20 rankings in maths, science and reading for the first time. In maths, the UK was 26th while in reading it was 23rd

In maths the UK was 26th – although researchers said a truer position would be 31st – while in reading it was 23rd. A slump in science took Britain from 16th in 2009 to 21st place now.

In 2006, British children came 14th in science, 17th in reading and 24th in maths.

The poor results come despite a near doubling of the education budget between 1997 and 2010 under Labour – from £50billion a year to £89billion.

Education Secretary Michael Gove said the poor results showed radical reform was necessary in a ‘stagnating’ education system.

Mr Philips was speaking at the launch of Morrison's new £200million online grocery service.

It is a difficult time for the big supermarket chains with Tesco, Morrisons and Marks & Spencer all having announced humiliating Christmas takings.

Morrisons saw festive sales down by 5.6 per cent on a year ago, and now says full-year profits will be at the lower end of forecasts, around £783million.

Its shares slumped 7.75 per cent after a trading performance described as ‘quite awful’ by Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital Stockbrokers.

The  company’s growth has been hampered by its relatively small number of convenience stores and its slowness to offer an online shopping service.

By contrast, Aldi and Lidl’s efforts to win over upmarket shoppers were met with success.

The stores offered higher quality food and drink, from aged fillet steaks at £5 to award-winning mince pies and fresh turkeys.
