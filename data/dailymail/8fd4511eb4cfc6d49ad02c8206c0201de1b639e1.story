Malala Yousafzai has marked her 17th birthday by visiting Nigeria to call for the release of the 219 schoolgirls still in the grip of Boko Haram militants.

The Pakistani teenager has also persuaded Nigeria's president Goodluck Jonathan to meet the girls' parents for the first time.

'My birthday wish this year is "Bring Back Our Girls" now and alive,' she said, three months after the extremist group abducted almost 300 women and girls in the northeast town of Chibok.

Meeting: Malala Yousafzai, who survived a Taliban assassination attempt in 2012, has met with Nigeria's president Goodluck Jonathan in a bid to free the 219 schoolgirls abducted by Boko Haram in April

Plea: Malala appealed directly to Boko Haram to free the 219 girls who are still missing three months on

Malala became an international figurehead 
for women's rights in the face of hard-line Islam after surviving a 
Taliban assassination attempt in 2012.

It is the first major international summit on the matter since former prime minister Gordon Brown visited Abuja in May.

Now, she is using her position in a bid to free the 219 girls still missing.

Visiting some of the few who have escaped their captors, Malala appealed directly to Boko Haram.

'Lay down your weapons. Release your sisters. Release my sisters. 
Release the daughters of this nation. Let them be free. They have 
committed no crime.'

She added: 'You are misusing the name of Islam... the Quran teaches brotherhood.'

Malala, who is now based in Birmingham with her family, also spoke against the custom of child brides in her home country, a 
tradition common in Nigeria, too.

After giving speeches, Malala received a welcome gift and a birthday present from Goodluck Jonathan

Emotional: Malala (right, next to her father) said it was emotional meeting the relatives of the kidnapped girls

Support: She posed for photos with grieving families and appealed directly to Boko Haram to free her 'sisters'

Education: She also met with girls' education activists in Abuja to discuss how the government can invest more

Boko Haram has threatened to sell some
 of the girls as brides if its fighters are not freed.

'Protect 
girls from cruelty,' she said in her annual Malala Day speech, saying 
girls should not be forced to marry or to leave school to become brides 
'when they should be girls,' or to give birth to children 'when they 
themselves are children'.

Today, Malala met with Nigeria's President Goodluck Jonathan and told reporters that the president 'promised me that the girls will be returned as soon as possible.'

She also appealed to the Nigerian government to dedicate more money 
to education and to drastically reduce the hundreds of thousands of 
children who are out of school throughout the country, not just in the 
area targeted by Boko Haram.

The group's name means 'Western 
education is sinful'. Boko Haram wants to enforce an Islamic state in 
Nigeria, whose 170 million people are almost equally divided between 
Christians in the south and Muslims in the north.

Describing an emotional meeting with some of the girls' parents on Sunday, she said: 'I could see tears in their eyes. They were hopeless. But they seem to have this hope in their hearts,' and they were asking if they could meet the president.

Birthday celebrations: To mark her 17th birthday, Malala blew out candles on a cake with Nigerian activists

Summit: The finance minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala (left) and foreign minister Viola Onwuliri (right) also met with Malala to discuss measures that are being taken to free the 219 schoolgirls

Distraught: Though many of the family members drive to Abuja for rallies, Goodluck Jonathan has not visited

Jonathan has not met with any of the parents, though some regularly make the dangerous drive from Chibok to join activists who have held daily rallies in Abuja.

When the activists tried to march peacefully to the presidential villa in May, they were blocked by soldiers and police.

Jonathan cancelled a planned trip to Chibok that same month.Â 

On Monday, he told Malala that 
criticism that his government is not doing enough 'is very wrong and 
misplaced,' according to a presidential statement.

'The
 great challenge in rescuing the Chibok girls is the need to ensure that
 they are rescued alive,' he said, insisting his government is 'very 
actively pursuing all feasible options' to achieve their safe return.

Branding the crisis 'Africa's Dunblane', Gordon Brown berated world leaders for failing to act quickly to retrieve the Chibok girls.

Mr Brown met with President Jonathan and the governors of state where the girls went missing.

He
 said: 'Nigeria is facing a moment of truth, when terrorists are trying 
to engineer a civil war and seeking to prevent girls from ever going to 
school under their theme that western education is a sin.'

Boko
 Haram leader Abubakar Shekau put out a new video Sunday in which he 
repeated demands that the government release detained insurgents in 
exchange for the girls' freedom.

Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau has released new videos calling for the government to release detained insurgents in exchange for the girls' freedom. He also warned some will be sold as brides if fighters are not freed

'Nigerians
 are saying "Bring Back Our Girls", and we are telling Jonathan to bring
 back our arrested warriors, our army,' he said in the video, which was 
obtained by the AP through similar channels used for previous messages.

Jonathan so far has refused, despite pleas from the parents.

Boko Haram attacks continued over the weekend.

Witnesses claim the
 group bombed a major bridge on a northeast Nigerian highway
 that further limits access to its base camps in the Sambisa Forest, 
where it is believed to be holding some of the girls.

Gunmen 
destroyed most of the bridge on the road between Maiduguri and Biu on 
Saturday night, making it impossible for vehicles to cross.
