Increase: Sales of drink to be consumed at home rose by 1.3per cent in terms of volume in the year (picture posed by model)

Britons are getting goggle-eyed by following the example set by Gogglebox couple Steph and Dom.

The couple are known for enjoying big measures of booze, particularly champagne, while commenting on TV trivia in the popular Channel 4 series.

And it seems they are typical of a nation that is drinking more bubbly, particularly at home.

Sales of drink to be consumed at home rose by 1.3per cent in terms of volume in the year to the end of July – turning around a long term fall.

The trend was driven by the fact that many people have cut back on going to the pub because of the high prices, while the World Cup was also a factor encouraging people to drink more at home.

The extra volume equates to 33.1million litres, while the value of drink sold for home consumption was up by 3.3per cent to £11.6billion.

Sparkling wine has been the strongest performer, with the volume up by five per cent and the value of these sales growing by a higher 14.8per cent, as people traded up from cheap Cava to more expensive Prosecco and Champagne.

Sales of sparkling wine rose by £70million to some £541million with more than 40per cent of people saying they had bought bubbly in the past year.

Kevan Mulcahey, head of alcohol at Kantar Worldpanel, which collated the figures, said: ‘Shoppers are looking for something a bit special to treat themselves, and sparkling wine is a luxury product with an affordable price tag.

‘Shoppers are trading up from Cava to Prosecco and Prosecco to Champagne, boosting sales of sparkling wine by 14.8per cent compared with the same time last year.

‘Cava’s growth has gone flat with sales only growing by 0.1per cent whereas the more premium option, Prosecco, has enjoyed a 74.6per cent surge in sales over the past year alone, driving the increasing popularity of sparkling wines.’

Significantly, sales of bottles of Veuve Cliquot, the most expensive big Champagne brand sold in supermarkets, are up by 34.7per cent.

Mr Mulcahey said: ‘Many retailers have cottoned on to this shift towards more premium alcoholic beverages and now stock high-quality own-label sparkling wines, making them very competitive options.’

Example: Steph and Dom from Gogglebox are known for drinking heavily while watching TV

Kantar said sparkling wine has become a popular choice for couples over the past five years. Some 13per cent is now consumed by couples, like Steph and Dom, who run an upmarket bed and breakfast from a £3.5million property in Kent, having a night in.

‘Motivations for sparkling wine occasions have become more about ‘having a laugh’ – with 15per cent of volume drunk on these occasions compared with 11per cent five years ago,’ it said.

Figures detailing the rise in drinking at home were published in The Grocer magazine, which highlighted how Steph and Dom once had such a good night on the fizz and cocktails that they tipped up the sofa in front of the TV cameras.

Kantar said: ‘There’s been a small fall in number of serves at home, but volumes are going up.’

The Grocer magazine said the figures suggest that people are pouring larger measures than they might have done in the past.

The Kantar data suggest the drink by discount chains Aldi and Lidl to offer bargain bubbly is partly responsible for increased consumption. Sales through these stores are up by 25.4per cent in a year

‘Even if you have not seen the show (Gogglebox), you will recognise the type because some of us seem to be becoming more like them,’ it said.

‘For all our good intentions, we are still drinking more at home. Even though the average number of drinks we serve at home is falling, volume sales are going up.

‘This could suggest we are simply pouring ourselves bigger drinks. Steph and Dom, known for their generous measures, would certainly approve.’

The Kantar data suggest the drink by discount chains Aldi and Lidl to offer bargain bubbly is partly responsible for increased consumption. Sales through these stores are up by 25.4per cent in a year.
