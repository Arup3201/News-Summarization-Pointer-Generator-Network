Britain is rife with welfare ghettos where more than half the working age population is dependent on unemployment benefits, a think-tank claims.

As many as 6.8million people and 1.8million children have been trapped into long-term poverty, the Centre for Social Justice says in a report.

It would mean nearly one in five children are growing up in a workless household – the  second highest in Europe after Macedonia where it is nearly one in four.

The study by the CSJ – founded by 
Iain Duncan Smith before he became Work and Pensions Secretary – said 
parts of Denbighshire in Wales were among the worst affected areas.

In the Rhyl West ward 67 per cent of people aged between 16 and 64 are dependent on benefits for the out of work.

In Liverpool there are nearly 70 
neighbourhoods where the number of people claiming  out-of-work benefits
is 30 per cent or higher. This is followed by Birmingham (49 
neighbourhoods), Hull (45), Manchester (40), Leeds (37) and Knowsley, 
Merseyside (31).

CSJ chief Christian Guy, whose 
think-tank’s study is called Signed Off, Written Off, said: ‘The welfare
ghettos trapping as many as 6.8million people are a national disgrace.

‘They represent years of tragic 
failure and indifference from the political class.

'People in these 
neighbourhoods have been consistently written off as incapable and their
poverty plight inevitable. Their lives have been limited by a 
fatalistic assumption that they have little prospect of anything 
better.’

The report said: ‘The vast majority 
of charities helping the unemployed surveyed... say that they know of 
families where two or three generations have no one in work.’

The CSJ said the UK could not afford to delay the Government’s welfare reforms.

The report authors write: ‘These 
arguments are important as the Government now spends more than one in 
every three pounds on welfare.’

However, they said there was  a greater social rather than financial imperative for reforming welfare.

‘By focusing on income transfers rather than employment, our welfare 
system has made people dependent on benefits, trapping them in poverty 
and preventing them from achieving economic independence.’

Struggling: Charities are fighting to keep up with demand for extra services, with around three food banks opening across the UK each week

Welfare revolution: Iain Duncan Smith, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, founded the think tank that wrote the report

One of the charities, Chance UK, said that some children do not understand what work is.

Asked what they wanted to be when they grew up, the children only answered 'I want to be famous' or that they wanted to be the 'boss' of a gang.

However, the think tank said there was a greater social rather than financial imperative for reforming welfare: 'By focusing on income transfers rather than employment, our welfare system has made people dependent on benefits, trapping them in poverty and preventing them from achieving economic independence.'

The CSJ, founded by Iain Duncan Smith, before he became Work & Pensions Secretary, is working on a follow-up report, in which it will set out recommendations for the second phase of the 'welfare revolution'.
