Police are hunting a saboteur who left hundreds of drawing pins on a cycle track where racing bikers were travelling at speeds of up to 50mph.

The spikes, which were placed on a downhill stretch of road during a cycling event near Bridgend in South Wales, were painted black to blend in with the surface.

More than 70 competitors were left with punctures as a result of the prank, which some are claiming is ‘attempted murder’, after the tacks were scattered on a hairpin bend.

Cyclist Richard Manning, 46, from Llandeilo in Carmarthenshire was one of the people taking part in the Valleys Velo Sportive and rode over the pins.

He had been travelling at about 50mph when he noticed his front wheel clicking but was fortunate enough to stop safely and repair his inner tube.

He said: ‘I only hope that the culprits are caught and that their punishment is enough to dissuade from this.

‘The placement of these drawing pins on a really fast descent, just before a hairpin bend can only lead to the conclusion that the saboteur was hoping to cause serious injury - or even death.

‘Add to this painting them black to camouflage them on the road shows a level of planning I find deeply distressing.’

Rider Gary Dawes posted on Twitter: ‘Black painted drawing pins scattered as sabotage on a fast descent is nothing less than attempted murder.’

In a video posted on YouTube, several riders can be seen pitched up on the side of the road attempting to repair their punctures.

Mr Manning added that one cyclist he spoke with had five separate punctures.

No one is thought to have been injured during the race.

Police are working with race organisers to investigate the act of sabotage which took place on Sunday, September 28.

Organiser Jamie Rowland said: ‘I couldn't believe it when I first received the call to say what was happening.

One cyclist has claimed that the sabotage is 'attempted murder' after the pins were painted black to blend in

‘My heart sunk thinking of the riders and their safety who were unfortunately caught up in the unfolding events, all their training and effort undone by some mindless idiot.’

It is not the first incident of its kind - earlier this year a race in the New Forest was sabotaged.

Nails were strewn along a stretch of road in Bransgore, Hampshire, as more than 20 participants in the Wiggle Sportive suffered punctures.

And in 2012 French police investigated an attack on the Tour de France after tacks were scattered at stage 14 of the race.
