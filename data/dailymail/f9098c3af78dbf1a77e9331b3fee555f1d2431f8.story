Sir Chris 
Hoy again demonstrated his gentlemanly side by valiantly defending a 
member of the Games security team who asked that he provide ID to gain 
access to the Sir Chris Hoy velodrome, named in his honour.

‘She was 
just doing her job!’, he tweeted about the incident which came the day 
after he helped with the malfunctioning baton at the opening ceremony.

Badminton star Parupalli Kashyap has his sights set on one of Glasgow’s karaoke bars should he win gold for India. The 27-year-old second seed, who competes in the men’s singles and mixed team events, says he hopes to hit the right notes on and off the court.

‘If I win gold I will be in the mood to sing. Whenever I get a chance, I like to sing,’ he said.

‘My shoes were owned by two people before me and they burst at the side when I was lunging,’ he said.

Oala duly recorded two failed lifts in the snatch, but did redeem himself with a new national record of 118kg in the clean and jerk.
