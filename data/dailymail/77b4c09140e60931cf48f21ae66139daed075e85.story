Alone in the darkness, in icy waters on the sea bed, her rusting hulk symbolises the sacrifice so many made for freedom.

This is the ghostly image of HMS Royal Oak, torpedoed by a German U-Boat during one of the blackest days of the Second World War.

The magnificent battleship’s guns lie twisted in the deep, her once-proud tower broken and buried by the sands of the last seven decades.

Tragedy: 800 officers were killed in the attack on HMS Royal Oak on October 14, 1939 as it sat in the Orkney sea. It sank in 13 minutes after being torpedoed

Cheap: Naval leaders ordered for the battleship to be cheaper than they could afford. But as war approached they backtracked and weighed it down with weaponry

But today, after a poignant mission 
ahead of tomorrow’s Remembrance Day commemorations, a white ensign was 
raised once again from the ship.

Royal Navy divers carried a new 
standard 80ft below the surface of Scapa Flow in the Orkneys, where the 
warship sunk in 1939, and attached it to the upturned hull.

It is an annual ritual performed to underline an eternal promise - that those who gave their lives would never be forgotten.

Remembering: A naval diver replaced the White Ensign - a Union Jack and St George's flag - on the wreck of HMS Royal Oak in the Scapa Flow in the Orkneys

Wartime: She faced Franco's bombers while protecting the borders of Spain during the Civil War 1936-9. The ship also starred in a film as a South American rebel vessel

'The Mighty Oak' as she was known, was a Revenge Class battleship built in Devonport and launched in 1914.

She first saw action at the Battle of Jutland. The 29,000 ton ship had a top speed of 20 knots and an impressive array of guns. But by the time World War II broke out she was deemed unsuitable for front-line action.

She was sunk while anchored at Scapa Flow, the wartime home of the fleet, on October 14, 1939. The war was just 41 days old.

A U-Boat captained by German naval ace Günther Prien sneaked through a blockade into the supposedly safe haven, and fired a series of torpedoes. Three scored direct hits and the ship took only around ten minutes to sink.

HMS Royal Oak was loaded with fuel and ammunition - so regular safety inspections of the wreck have to be carried out along the wreck's 620ft (189m) hull.

Twelve years ago, 97-year-old war widow Dorothy Golding was reunited with her late husband Arthur when her ashes were placed in a weighted casket in the ship on which he died.

Six weeks into the war, 833 sailors were killed when the ship went down in minutes after being attacked at anchor.

Most were killed by fire, many as they slept in their hammocks. Of those who escaped, few survived the freezing cold sea.

More
than 100 of the ship’s 1,234 compliment were ‘boy sailors’, the war’s 
biggest loss of these brave teenage seamen, assigned to the British 
fleet before they became ordinary seamen at 18.

In
a sombre ceremony, ten divers from the Royal Navy Northern Diving 
Group, based at Faslane, raised the flag in the eerie underwater silence
before attaching it to an upper propshaft and saluting the memory of 
the fallen.

Normally, the white ensign is flown at all times when Royal Navy ships are underway.

Here,
it could hardly flutter in the same way as the one on a nearby shore 
memorial does - but at least the current allowed it to stay unfurled 
with some dignity.

This
was still a war grave, after all, and hundreds of ordinary men and 
boys, who once served beneath this flag’s wartime forebear, lay inside.

The ship’s previous ensign was recovered and will be presented to the Royal Oak Association.

The
haunting picture of HMS Royal Oak was created technologically 12 years 
ago by joining together a series of photographs and video clips, the 
only possible way to visualise the wreck through the murky waters as a 
single image.

Even on the clearest days, visibility is limited to around 50ft; on bad days, to virtually nothing.

After
the ensign was in place, the diving group’s commanding officer, 
Lieutenant Commander Richard Osbaldestin, paid tribute to the dead and 
their sacrifice.

‘Diving
on the Royal Oak is a timely reminder to the younger members of the 
team of the UK’s maritime heritage and the great contribution the Royal 
Navy made,’ he said.

‘For
many at the time, this tragedy symbolised the beginning of the war in 
the realisation that nowhere was safe - and the country was at war at 
home just as much as it was on the Continent.’

Having survived the First World War, she narrowly missed bombs thrown by Franco's pilot during the Spanish Civil War while conducting 'non intervention patrols' around the coast.

In
1937 she also starred in a melodramatic movie, Our Fighting Navy, as a 
South American rebel ship, El Mirante, commandeered by Robert Douglas.

Despite the relatively shallow water in which she sank, the majority of bodies could not be recovered from Royal Oak.

The wreck has been designated a war grave and all diving or other unauthorised forms of exploration are prohibited under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986.

Ritual: Officers remember the site, now an official war grave, every year. This time, they recovered the original flag and took it to display

'Diving on the Royal Oak is a timely reminder to the younger members of the team of the UK's maritime heritage,' Lt Cdr Richard Osbaldestin said

The brass letters that formed Royal Oak's name were removed as a keepsake by a recreational diver in the 1970s.

After being returned twenty years later, they were displayed in the Scapa Flow visitor centre in Lyness.

A
memorial at St Magnus' Cathedral in nearby Kirkwall displays a plaque 
dedicated to those who lost their lives and a book of names.

This list of names was not released by the Government until 40 years after the sinking.

A page of the book is turned every week.
