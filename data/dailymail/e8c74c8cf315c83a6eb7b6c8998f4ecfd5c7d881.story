Slip up: Banana mogul Thomas Hoey pleaded guilty Thursday to charges he supplied a sex partner with fatally potent cocaine and delayed calling for help when she overdosed during a 3-way sex romp at a posh Manhattan hotel in 2009

A New York banana mogul on the hook since 2009 on charges he contributed to a woman's death during a cocaine fueled 3-way sex romp at a posh Manhattan hotel finally pleaded guilty Thursday.

Thomas Hoey Jr., 46, admitted in federal court that he delayed calling for help when one of his ladies, 41-year-old Kimberly Calo, began seizing and bleeding from the nose that April night after doing too much of his potent coke.

The Long Island man even confessed he continued to supply friends with cocaine following Calo's gruesome death as he helped hamper authorities' efforts to bring him to justice through 2010.

Hoey 
admitted Thursday that he coerced Nicole Zobkiw, the third party in the 
night's 3-way, to lie about what happened to a grand jury.

Hoey
 is charged with conspiracy to distribute cocaine, aiding in perjury 
conspiracy and obstruction of justice, reports the New York Post.

His
 guilty pleas were the culmination of years of speculation and 
accusations regarding the importer's hard-partying and callous ways.

Calo
 collapsed and began 'frothing at the mouth' that night after consuming 
the high-quality cocaine the $700-a-night suite at The Kitano hotel on 
Park Avenue.

Hoey allegedly wasn't alarmed by Calo's condition and said 'heâ€™d seen this before' and that she 'was going to be fine.'

The
 banana mogul had sex with Zobkiw and then set his attention towards 
Calo, a personal trainer, retired NYPD detective Edward Boyle, who 
investigated Calo's 2009 death, said on the stand last year.

Victim: Personal trainer Kimberley Calo, 41, died in the Upper East Side's Kitano hotel after Hoey neglected to call for help in time to save her

Calo
 had first snorted the coke laying on a coffee table and when she went 
back for more, she began overdosing and 'her head dropped to the table 
with a thud,' Boyle told jurors at Manhattan federal court, where Zobkiw
 was on trial for making false statements and perjury.

Zobkiw was later found guilty of lying to a grand jury about the fatal party.

The
 court was told Zobkiw attempted to get Hoey to call the emergency 
services but he refused, allegedly telling her that Calo would be fine.

Boyle told the court that Hoey assured Zobkiw that a 'doctor friend' was on the way.

Hoey also admitted to coercing the other woman there that night, Nicole Zobkiw, to lie for him about the night's events while under oath (pictured is the scene of the tragedy, the Kitano Hotel)

Zobkiw's lawyer Leonard Lato admitted his client had to tried to hide what happened on the night.

But she was intimidated two days before her grand jury testimony in 2011 by a 'corrupt lawyer' allegedly linked to Hoey, Lato said.

Zobkiw has not yet faced sentencing.

Under his new plea deal, Hoey faces 11 to 13 years in prison on federal charges.

For the state charges he tampered with evidence by trying to clean up Calo's blood, Hoey faces four years.

He's due for sentencing on the state charges next week.

On the federal charges, Hoey will be sentenced Dec. 15.
