James Packer and David Gyngell have been given criminal infringement notices for offensive behaviour following their very public brawl outside Packer's Bondi mansion on Sunday.

The penalty carries a fine of $500 if it goes uncontested by the recipient.

NSW Police released a statement on Friday afternoon stating: 'Officers from the Eastern Suburbs Local Area Command have been investigating the incident which occurred about 2pm on Sunday 4 May on Sir Thomas Mitchell Road near the intersection of Campbell Parade at Bondi.

'Police today issued a 46-year-old man and a 48-year-old man with a Criminal Infringement Notice for offensive behaviour.'

A Nine spokesperson told the MailOnline: 'Mr Gyngell is pleased the process is now resolved.'

The $500 fine is unlikely to be a problem for casino mogul Packer or Nine Entertainment CEO Gyngell, with Forbes estimating Packer's net worth to be $US6.3 billion ($A6.7 billion).

In November last year Nine Entertainment's prospectus revealed Gyngell is the highest-paid media executive in Australia with a remuneration package worth about $10 million a year, The Australian Financial Review reported.

The case surrounding the punch-up stalled earlier in the week due to the fact neither Packer, 46, nor Gyngell, 48, lodged an official complaint over the incident.

Acting assistant police commissioner Mark Walton held a press conference where he said police had contacted the men's legal representatives but neither man had been questioned over the incident and heavily watermarked images had made investigation difficult.

'We first became aware of it as it was released in the media,' he said. 'We did review our holdings to see if there was anything we missed.

'In the earlier material it was so difficult to see what was going on because of the branding of it, I certainly wasn’t expecting police to rush out there.

'As the material has become available and the police have started to form a view of what occurred, that is the appropriate time to hold our inquiries.'

On Tuesday Gyngell took responsibility for the stoush, releasing a statement which said had he not turned up at Packer’s premises in an angry mood, then the confrontation would never have occurred.

'[Mr Gyngell] fully accepts that he was the instigator of the incident. He respects the job police do and will co-operate fully with their investigation,' the statement said.

Packer and Gyngell, who are childhood friends and were best man at one another's wedding, came to blows in the street outside Packer's luxury beach side apartment on Sunday afternoon.

The fight followed a heated text message exchange because Packer believed a camera crew from the network run by Gyngell was trying to catch him with rumoured lover, model Miranda Kerr.

Gyngell had gone to the $20 million property in Sydney's Bondi Beach to reassure casino owner he was not under surveillance by Nine Network television cameras.

The pair immediately became embroiled in a profanity-laced argument which descended into blows.

Explosive pictures showed Packer in tracksuit pants and a bearded, bare-foot Gyngell pummeling each other repeatedly and wrestling on the ground before being pulled apart by a bodyguard.

Reports of the scuffle say Gyngell, the smaller of the two men, appeared to connect with Packer's eye in a left hook. Following the fight, Packer was seen walking off with his left eye puffy and his grey tracksuit pants marked with grass stains.
