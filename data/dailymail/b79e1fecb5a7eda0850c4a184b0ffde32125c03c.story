Manchester United will pursue Edinson Cavani in the summer after establishing that his club Paris Saint-Germain would not countenance a sale this month.

Sir Alex Ferguson is understood to have called his former United centre half Laurent Blanc to check on the Uruguay striker's situation and the PSG coach said they would not listen to bids in this window, but would be willing to discuss the possibility at the end of the season.

It proves how comfortable Moyes is with Ferguson's presence that he is utilising his predecessor's network of contacts to take the next stage in rebuilding United.

It's good to talk: Sir Alex Ferguson spoke to PSG boss and former United player Laurent Blanc about Cavani

Moyes was interested in Cavani in the summer but shelved the idea of a bid as he pursued midfielders and a left back. Injuries and form have dictated a world-class striker is required though and Cavani's dissatisfaction with life in Paris means he is a prime candidate.

That does not mean Moyes wants to offload Wayne Rooney, however.

United are prepared to bite the bullet and let Rooney run down his contract until 2015 if he continues to turn down talks on a new deal. He has worked well with Moyes and the hope is he will be convinced by what the manager looks to bring in in the summer.

Suitor: Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho is a known admirer of Rooney and is expected to bid again for the striker

Chelsea remain keen on Rooney and will bid again for the England striker but United plan to stick to their stance that he is not for sale.

United are interested in Juan Mata but a swap is unlikely. They believe the player would push to move to Old Trafford if a bid was made but, likewise, Chelsea would prefer to sell abroad, if at all. With that in mind United, are continuing to look elsewhere but Moyes is wary of what pressure would fall on the shoulders of any signing that is made now.

Form and morale should be lifted this week by the return of Rooney to the first-team squad, while Robin van Persie is back at Carrington today after his weekend trip to Holland.

Final details: Everton expect to finalise Lacina Traore's loan move from Monaco to Goodison Park shortly

Difficult deal: Everton have struggled to strike a deal with Standard Liege for Michy Batshuayi (left)

The presence of PSV Eindhoven's fitness coach Arno Philips in recent weeks has not gone down too well among all sports science staff at United but there is an acceptance that he is a man the player has grown to trust over his career.

Which Premier League defenders were involved in such an angry training ground spat that the mother of one of the youth team players decided to complain to local police? The players have since settled their differences - for now.

Everton hope to wrap up the signing of Lacina Traore on loan from Monaco but are facing an increasingly difficult task to sign No 1 target Michy Batshuayi of Standard Liege.

Roberto Martinez was keen to sign the 20-year-old Belgian until Everton were told his £7million clause would have to be paid in full. That has delayed their bid until the summer but an extra complication is that Borussia Dortmund have made a move to sign the striker.

The clubs met in a friendly in La Manga last week and Dortmund officials are ready to pay the asking price. Liege president Roland Duchatelet insists Batshuayi will not be leaving the club this month.

Benfica, as well as Arsenal, have also shown interest. When Batshuayi was asked whether he will play the next five months for Liege, he answered: 'For sure!'

However, the player himself told Het Laatste Nieuws: 'The Premier League and the Bundesliga are my favourite destinations. Benfica is a big club, but I'm not really convinced by the Portuguese league.'

Prospect: Arsenal were spotted scouting Lille's Pape Souare in their match against St Etienne on Friday

Arsenal scouts were at the Stade Geoffroy Guichard on Friday to watch Lille left-back Pape Souare against St Etienne.

The Senegal defender has impressed this season and has scored three goals in 20 Ligue 1 appearances.

Meanwhile, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger says he is not 'particularly interested' in signing Juventus' Mirko Vucinic. The 30-year-old striker's agent was reportedly heading for London on Monday but instead he is expected to join Inter Milan on loan.

Ailing Inter have been frustrated in their attempts to sign Pablo Osvaldo from Southampton and have offered Fredy Guarin to Juventus in a bid to make Vucinic's transfer permanent.

Should Guarin stay, Juve may try again for Nani at Manchester United but the £16m price may still beyond their January budget.

In safe hands: Manchester City are considering swooping for Real Madrid goalkeeper Diego Lopez

Manchester City will monitor developments with Real Madrid goalkeeper Diego Lopez. The 32-year-old, installed as No 1 ahead of Iker Casillas by Jose Mourinho last year, is wanted by Borussia Dortmund and City may enter the bidding if there is any sign of a sale.

Costel Pantilimon is ready to leave in the summer and Lopez would be perfect competition for Joe Hart.
