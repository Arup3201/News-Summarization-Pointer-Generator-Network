A teenage scrounger due to appear in a new benefits programme hopes the experience will catapult him to celebrity status, with a new set of teeth thrown in for free along the way.

Travis Simpkins from Sheffield is among a handful of people who will feature on Benefits Britain: Life on the Dole, a Channel 5 documentary starting tonight.

The 17-year-old, who says his only job is 'to be me', claims employment allowance after being diagnosed with ADHD.

Travis Simpkins will appear in Benefits Britain: Life on The Dole on Channel 5 tonight. The 18-year-old has hopes of becoming a reality TV star and being given new teeth on the NHS

On the road to stardom? The teenager hopes his appearance on the reality TV show will buy him a new set of teeth 

He hopes the programme, inspired by Channel 4's popular Benefits Street, will bring him the acclaim he needs to launch a career in showbiz. 

'I'm hoping to come off benefits in three months, I want to go into a TV career,' he said.. 

'I want to become a reality star and I'm hoping to apply for Big Brother's summer show. I just love cameras and love television.' 

The only thing holding him back from fame and fortune are his teeth, which he hopes will  be corrected by the taxpayer one way or another.

And if the NHS rejects his request, the teenager plans to set up an online donations page to pay for the dentistry. 

'I want to put up a website like fixmyteeth.com or something and ask people to help fix my teeth, to raise the money, then I’ll pay the rest. 

'No one has ever done that before.'

Critics have hit out at the teenager's plans saying he should focus more on work and less on vanity. 

'It's important we don't glamourise the benefits system,' Jonathan Isaby, Chief Executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance said. 

'Life is hard for those out of work, and that's why it's important the Government does everything it can to get people into employment - not just for taxpayers who may have to pick up the bill, but for the individuals concerned. 

'Taxpayers will hope this young man is devoting as much time to looking for work as he is to his appearance.'

Travis appears on the reality show with his friend, Stephanie Cocker, a 25-year-old single mother-of-two. 

Miss Cocker does not work because, with childcare so expensive, she says she would not have enough money left from a wage at the end of the month.

Travis hopes he will be selected to appear on reality TV shows in the future, like Benefits Street's White Dee (right) who starred in Celebrity Big Brother after sharing details of her life claiming from the state

White Dee, real name Deirdre Kelly, was the stand-out star of Channel 4's controversial series Benefits Street. 

She and her neighbours on James Turner Street in Birmingham became the most prolific benefits scroungers in the country in the show's wake. 

But the stardom afforded to her by the show's popularity brought with it a wave of opportunities. 

Namely expensive appearances at parties in Magaluf where the mother-of-two was seen swigging champagne and topping up her tan. 

And a stint on Celebrity Big Brother followed before Dee shifted her focus to politics. 

She appeared at a fringe meeting at the Conservative Party Conference and features on debate panels regularly to discuss Britain's welfare system. 

Dee no longer claims benefits, and while she says she is disappointed to have been cast in a negative light by producers of the show, she is grateful to be able to provide her children with more.

Instead she chooses to stay at home with her children and claim benefits. 

Travis has a more simple explanation - he doesn't see himself in an office job or working behind a bar. 

'I'm just me. That's my job. I want to entertain people. 

'I had a part time job as a valet when I was 16 for four weeks and I got £25-a-day. I don't feel like I could do a job sitting in an office or in a shop or behind a bar or in a call centre or at a butcher's. 

'I don't think I could do it.' 

And while he admits that 'everybody is entitled to their opinion', the teen would rather see some 'keep theirs to themselves'. 

Miss Cocker is more apprehensive about criticism, claiming the programme 'edits it to make you look bad.' 

'There was no mention of all the work I've done,' she said, referencing her stint as a nightclub bouncer which ended when she fell pregnant. 

'I can't go back to night work because I can't get child minders overnight. They never put anything in about that,' the 25-year-old bemoaned. 

Keen to turn her life around, Miss Cocker is on the lookout for new opportunities to become a social worker.  

'I want to go back to college, I want qualifications, I want to go and get GCSEs. At the moment I’m looking for education and then I want to be a youth worker.'
