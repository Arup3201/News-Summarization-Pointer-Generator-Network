The price of a long black or latte could soar to $5 a cup down under as the price of the world-renowned Arabica bean reaches new highs.

Drought in one of the world's largest producing coffee countries, Brazil, has pushed the price of the bean to  $2.50 for half a kilo  making it the most expensive it has been in two and a half years.

It's raised new fears that the price of of coffee will soar to $5 a cup in Australia as local roasters struggle to cope with tight profit margins and rising overheads of running their own business.

The price of an average cup of gourmet blend coffee could soar to $5 due to demand for beans

Peter Nikolakopoulos from the Kaffeina group, which sells Illy coffee in Australia, said consumers will be forced to fork out more as businesses struggle to cover with costs of ''labour, rents and electricity.'

'I think it might (reach $5),' he told The Australian. 'But that's a reflection of labour costs, not coffee prices.' 

'I'll use the example of Illy, which is an expensive, premium coffee which retails for $50 a kilo. You get 140 cups out of a kilo, so you're talking a 35 cent coffee component.

'It's a long way from there to $5.'

Brazil is the world's largest coffee grower but is facing an uphill battle to meet demand

The main reason the world's coffee is costing more is due to a lack of rainfall in world-renowned coffee producer Brazil which harvests more than a third of the world's caffeine content.

The South American country is in the grip of a drought, raising fears that next year's crop will be the most underwhelming it has been in years.

The last coffee harvest was Brazil’s smallest in three years, after the main growing region experienced its worst drought in decades in the spring.

In July, unseasonable rains caused some trees to flower early for the next year’s crop, but dry weather followed, causing some of those trees to drop their flowers and others to not flower at all.

The International Coffee Organisation said that the new season, which began on October 1, could be the worst producing crop since 2006.
