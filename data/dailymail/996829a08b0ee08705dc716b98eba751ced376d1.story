Gerard Berger had only just moved from the Gold Coast to Perisher on June 16 to start a three month stint working at the resort

The 25-year-old snowboarder found dead in Perisher on Wednesday had been having 'the best day of his life' before he went missing at the NSW ski field.

Gerard Berger had only just moved from the Gold Coast to Perisher on June 16 to start a three month stint working at the resort.

But just two weeks after he left home, his family were hit with the devastating news that a snowboarding accident had claimed his life. 

'From what I heard he was having the best day of his life, the day it happened,' his brother Rudi told the Gold Coast Bulletin.

Gerard went snowboarding with his colleagues on Wednesday and was last seen by friends at 12.30pm.

He was reported missing by the resort at 10.50pm after he didn't arrive for his rostered shift and police discovered he had not returned from snowboarding earlier in the day.

His family were told Gerard may have missed jumping a creek that can be difficult to see when it's covered in snow.

He may have hit his head and fallen back into the creek or drowned after searchers found his body in the creek at about 11.30pm.

A post mortem is yet to be carried out to determine exactly how he died.

'He’s always happy and the one to make a fool of himself to make sure other people are happy and laughing. He’s just the best brother and person I could ever ask for – the person I’ll always look up to in my life,' Rudi said.

Gerard had taken to Facebook in the days before his death sharing photos of the ski fields and posting weather updates.

The day before he left the Gold Coast, Gerard wrote: 'After leaving it till the final day I have finally finished packing, it finally started snowing and I can’t wait to get there!!! Perisher bound baby!!'

The small alpine community of Perisher was shocked by the tragic death of a staff member, according to Perisher CEO Peter Brulisauer.

'It's obviously a very sad day for his family and the entire Perisher community - our condolences go out to the young man’s family and friends during this difficult time,' he said.

A report is being prepared for the Coroner.

This comes after seven-year-old Haadi Akhtar, from Roxburgh Park in Melbourne's north, was found dead and completely buried in snow at Mt Buller in Victoria on Wednesday night last week.

After a slow start to the season, Australian snowfields have received a massive dumping of snow since last weekend.

Blizzards last week dumped 80cm of snow in 24 hours in some parts of the Snowy Mountains.

The current forecast for NSW is not as extreme.

Perisher is expected to receive 16cm of snow over the next week.
