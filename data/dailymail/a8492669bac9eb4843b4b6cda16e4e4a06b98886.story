The policy of killing terrorists using unmanned drone strikes can be counter-productive and increase support for insurgent groups, the CIA acknowledged in a secret report.

A CIA document reviewing attacks carried out by countries involved in counter-insurgency operations has revealed the agency is aware of the drawbacks when using the controversial tactic.

Drone warfare became increasingly important to the U.S. military towards the end of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as a way to collect intelligence and conduct airstrikes without risking American lives.

However, the tactic has been criticised for its potential to be used for terrorist propaganda and for causing civilian casualties.

Based on a classified file released by Wikileaks, The Sydney Morning Herald reported the 2009 study as stating drone strikes 'may increase support for the insurgents, particularly if these strikes enhance insurgent leaders' lore'.

It warns the insurgents' support could also increase if 'non-combatants are killed in the attacks, if legitimate or semi-legitimate politicians aligned with the insurgents are targeted, or if the government is already seen as overly repressive or violent'.

However, it said drone strikes could be useful if carried out as part of a wider strategy that involved conventional methods.

In 2009, 257 drone strikes were conducted in Afghanistan. That number climbed slightly to 277 in 2010 and there was a small bump up in 2011 to 294, though the data can change due to recalculation.

Come 2012 drone strikes became more frequent, climbing to 494 as the tactic became a cornerstone of U.S. strategy after President Obama pledged to reduce the number of troops fighting in the Middle East.

The U.S. has a massive arsenal of MQ-18 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper drones, capable of delivering Hellfire missiles more than 1,100 miles away.

The Reaper drones can also deliver 500-pound bomb payloads.

The 'unmanned aerial vehicles' are controlled from a land or ship base.

According to public sources, America has 172 Predator drones and 97 Reapers. Any one of them could be launched to eliminate terror leaders, including the warlords at the tip of the ISIS spear.

They are typically used by the U.S. Air Force and CIA to decimate enemy bases of operations and eliminate specific terrorist targets – including training camps and individual combatants.

It is believed targeted strikes on insurgent leaders leave their troops in disarray, but numerous examples referenced in the CIA study showed that Taliban and Al-Qaeda operated fluid lower-management divisions which could easily replace killed leaders.
