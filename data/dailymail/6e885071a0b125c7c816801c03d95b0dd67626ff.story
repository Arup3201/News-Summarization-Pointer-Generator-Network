The French may find our British love scenes a little passe but it's our sense of humour that attracts viewers around the world.

A study found that British humour is the most popular reason why homegrown TV shows enjoy an international audience. The quality of content came second, closely followed by the love of a British accent.

But our saucy scenes were not so popular with the French ranking portrayal of romance in the UK as their least favourite reason for tuning into British programmes (4 per cent). And Italians did not rate them much higher at 6 per cent.

The latest series of popular Downton Abbey may be set in the 1920s, but that hasn't stopped it showing some saucy scenes between Lady Mary and Lord Tony Gillingham

But in India, they are a big hit with just under a quarter of people confessing their appreciation of a British love scene, with around 17 per cent of viewers in Mexico also a fan. 

The British sense of humour is particularly popular in Germany, China, the US, and Australia, researchers, who sampled viewers in 10 countries, found.

The depiction of English characters and a love of original British dramas completed the top five reasons why people watch British shows. 

While food shows are popular at home, only 8 per cent of US viewers, 5 per cent of French and 4 per cent of Japanese say they have any interest in watching shows from British kitchens.

The scenes between EastEnders' Max and Tanya were described as the soap's sexiest ever moment for their torrid affair

But around a quarter of Chinese and Indian respondents have an appetite for British cuisine.

Quintessential English characters go down well with Chinese viewers - with a third declaring their love for an English gentlemen or rose - as well as Japanese and Mexican viewers.

Paul Dempsey, president of global markets for BBC Worldwide which commissioned the study, said: 'The international demand for British TV shows is clear. This survey shows it is the range and quality of our programming that keeps global audiences coming back for more.'

Researchers sampled over 10,000 people between the ages of 16 to 64. 

 EastEnders

The affair between characters Max and Tanya has created some of the show's sexiest scenes.

The former lovers were seen meeting for secret sex sessions all over Albert Square, with the chance of getting caught seemingly only serving to increase the passion.

Sharing a steamy embrace with her estranged husband, Tanya's new husband almost catches them  in the act at the car lot where Tanya rips off her clothes and Max pulls down his trousers.

But the pair manage to go undetected and ultimately, the affair lasts much of the summer.

I, Claudius

The 1976 historical drama from the BBC charting the lives of the Julian emperors was ahead of its time when it came to the shocking sex scene where Claudius'  insatiable wife Messalina challenges a representative of the Guild of Prostitutes into a whore-off to see who can sleep with the most men.

Eventually the call girl staggers out in a disheveled state while Messalini continues and merrily shouts 'Come back you whore! We haven't finished!'

Tipping the Velvet

An uncensored BBC adaptation of Jeanette Winterson's love story between young woman Nan and a male impersonator Kitty.

The coming of age drama focuses on their budding lesbian relationship and the lusty yet tender erotic scenes did not shy away from the use of sex toys.

The Inbetweeners

In true Inbetweeners style, the sex scene between Will and Charlotte wasn't as much saucy as horribly cringeworthy.

Hopeless virgin Will awkwardly flounders on top on top of popular Charlotte as she attempts to give him instructions until eventually giving up. Not the hottest of British sex scenes but surely one of the funniest.

Downton Abbey

It may be set in the 1920s but that hasn't stopped Downton Abbey having plenty of salacious moments. But it was the shocking relationship between  Lady Mary and Lord Tony Gillingham that stole the title for sexiest scene in the programme after Mary secretly checked into a hotel to road-test her potential husband.  

Mary even declares: ‘It hasn’t taken me to long to get used to sharing a bed again!’

Misfits   

The British sci-fi series tells of a group of damaged youngsters with supernatural powers with a twist. Featuring a girl whose power was to make anyone lustful with the touch of a little finger, and a man who could remove others' superpowers through sexual intercourse, Misfits was always going to have many graphic sex scenes to choose from.

But it was when lovable loser Simon- the butt of every joke- finally hooks up with bad girl Alisha in an explosion of frustrated teenage passion that made a memorable and surprisingly touching  scene.
