Arsene Wenger has admitted that defender Thomas Vermaelen could be on his way out of Arsenal, as interest from Manchester United steps up.

Wenger, speaking ahead of Arsenal's participation in the Emirates Cup this weekend, said he 'expects' the Belgium centre half to stay, but concedes there is a chance he will leave.

'Its a big season for him. But this is the best shape I've seen him in last three years. He is finally rid of his ankle problem.'
