Tragedy: Three-year-old Meg Burgess had been to 
the shops with her mother, Lindsay and baby brother Wilson, when the wall collapsed on her

She was just skipping along behind her
mother, chattering about how she was going to do some baking once they 
got home from the shops.

But within a ‘millisecond’ 
three-year-old Meg Burgess was crushed to death when a newly constructed
garden wall collapsed on her.

Meg’s mother Lindsay and builders 
desperately tried to dig the toddler out of the rubble, but she was 
pronounced dead ten minutes after arriving at hospital.

Building company director George 
Collier, 59, yesterday appeared in court accused of manslaughter through
gross negligence by failing to take reasonable safety steps in the 
wall’s construction.

Mrs Burgess told Mold Crown Court in North Wales how ‘beautiful’ her daughter looked seconds before the tragedy.

She said: ‘She had a pound pocket money and spent it on some glitter. I was walking along and she was trotting behind.

‘She was telling me we were going to 
make cakes when we got back.

'I turned around to look how beautiful she 
was and she was about a couple of metres away from me.

'She looked up at 
me and the wall just came down.

'It all came down at one go, it engulfed 
her. Her head was the only thing not covered.’

She added that the wall 
had collapsed ‘within a millisecond’.

Collier is accused of not building the wall to a proper standard or taking appropriate advice.

Tributes: Flowers are left at the scene shortly after the little girl's death. Her mother and builders clawed at the 
bricks and soil but Meg was declared dead just 10 minutes after arriving
at Glan Clwyd Hospital

Collapse: As the family walked along a pavement next
to a cottage which was being renovated, a just-built five foot concrete
block garden wall collapsed onto Meg. Floral tributes and a teddy bear is pictured at the scene

Bryan Cox QC, prosecuting, said: ‘It 
was his gross negligence which caused Meg’s death. Her injuries were 
catastrophic, killing her almost instantly.’

The prosecution say the defendant was 
responsible for the tragedy because he was responsible for the design 
and construction of the wall, which was about 74ft long and 5ft 2in 
high.

The court heard Collier had used an 
excavator to move ten to 15 tons of earth and rubble behind the garden 
wall on the day of Meg’s death on July 26, 2008.

Mr Cox said in doing 
so, Collier had placed terrific ‘pressure and strain’ on the 
construction.

Court: Building
company director George Collier, 59, left, of Kinmel Bay, North Wales, denies
manslaughter on the basis of gross negligence. Meg's mother Lindsay, who tried to save her daughter, is pictured right

Wall: Interviewed by police, Collier, who had 
more than 30 years experience in the construction business, agreed he 
had not sought expert advice when constructing the wall

Health and Safety experts found the foundations for the wall were inadequate and the mortar was too weak.

Collier was company secretary for a 
newly formed building company, Parcol Developments, which was carrying 
out renovation work on Nightingale Cottage in Prestatyn for cabaret 
singer David Jones and his wife.

Interviewed by police, Collier, who 
has more than 30 years’ experience in the construction business, agreed 
he had not sought expert advice.

Mr Cox added: ‘He claimed Mr Jones was
in charge of the project, but you may feel this was a man trying to 
offset his responsibility rather than accept what was obviously his 
responsibility.’

Collier denies manslaughter.

The case continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
