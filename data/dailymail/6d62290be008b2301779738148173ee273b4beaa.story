A British Greenpeace activist facing charges of hooliganism in Russia has told how she felt so isolated in prison that she tapped out messages to fellow inmates on radiator pipes.

Alex Harris, 27, said the code 'kept her going' during her time in jail where she was forced to spend 23 hours a day alone in her cell.

She was among the so-called Arctic 30 protesters arrested on board a Greenpeace ship in September while demonstrating against oil drilling in the Arctic.

'Terrifying': Greenpeace activist Alex Harris speaks about her ordeal in a Russian prison after being released on bail on charges of hooliganism over a protest against oil drilling in the Arctic

Isolated: Ms Harris told how she communicated with fellow inmates by tapping messages on a radiator pipe

Ms Harris, from Exeter, Devon, said she was 'terrified' when she was first taken to the prison in Murmansk.

But when she discovered there was a fellow activist next door, she devised a painstaking way to communicate.

She told the BBC: 'There was a radiator pipe that ran all the way through the prison.

'We managed to have some conversation on the radiator pipes - one tap was A, two taps was B. Sometimes it took 23 taps to get out one letter.

'Even though we couldn't see each other, it felt like we were together.'

months in a Russian prison after being arrested for attempting to occupy
 an Arctic oil platform

Ms Harris said the past two months in prison had been difficult, describing the conditions as 'awful' and the food as 'disgusting'

The group were originally charged with
 piracy, an offence that carries a 15-year prison sentence, which Ms 
Harris feared would mean she could never have children.

The new charge has a maximum term of seven years.

A
 Russian court yesterday granted bail to the last of 30 crew 
members detained since their September protest.

The decision to 
free the ship's Australian radio operator Colin Russell reversed an 
earlier ruling and is likely to take diplomatic pressure off Russia as 
it prepares to host the upcoming Winter Olympic Games.

Russell
 was the only member of the multinational Arctic Sunrise crew to have 
had his bail request denied in a series of hearings held since November 
18.

The campaigners' 
open-sea protest targeted what will be Russia's first operational oil 
rig in the Arctic - a politically sensitive region that President 
Vladimir Putin views as the future of the country's energy exporting 
might.

Earlier this month, Ms Harris skipped for joy when a judge in St Petersburg ruled could be granted bail.

‘This has been the hardest experience 
of my life,’ she said afterwards, adding: ‘I will not dishonour 
Greenpeace or my country by trying to flee Russia or the investigation.’

Activist Anthony Perrett and 
journalist Kieron Bryan have also been bailed.

They were among six 
British nationals in the ‘Arctic 30’ who were imprisoned following the 
protest against drilling in the Arctic.

Ms Harris, 27, who acted as 
communications officer on Greenpeace’s Arctic Sunrise vessel, said: ‘I’m
 really happy. It’s not over yet but there’s light at the end of the 
tunnel.’

In a recent letter to her parents, the activist had said she 
was ‘trying very, very hard not to lose hope’.

‘Surely my future isn’t 
rotting in a prison in Murmansk?!’ she wrote.

Speaking at the family home in Dolton,
 north Devon, earlier this month, her father Cliff said: ‘This is fantastic news for us.

'It 
was nice to see her come into the courtroom with a smile on her face and
 holding her head high.

'These must have been two incredibly hard months 
for her, and we’re incredibly proud of how she has conducted herself 
throughout this ordeal.’

Mr Harris, 63, told how as a child, his daughter idolised David Attenborough and was fascinated by news about the environment.

He said: ‘Anything that was detrimental to wildlife she would sit up and take notice.

‘I can remember when she was young she
 had a poster up of David Beckham. All of a sudden Beckham was out of 
favour and David Attenborough was her new hero. She didn’t actually have
 any posters, but she really idolised him.’

Miss Harris joined Greenpeace two 
years ago in an office-based role and was on her first field trip when 
arrested by the Russians.

Her father continued: ‘We didn’t envisage that
 this whole situation was going to erupt like it did. We’ve found it 
very frightening. These are just ordinary people who care about the 
environment. The charges are ridiculous – what happened wasn’t piracy or
 hooliganism.’

Greenpeace has warned a spill in 
Arctic waters would be highly damaging to the environment and the 
extraction of more fossil fuels would add to climate change impacts.

Eleven Nobel Peace Prize laureates wrote to Russian president Vladimir 
Putin calling for the original piracy charges to be dropped.
