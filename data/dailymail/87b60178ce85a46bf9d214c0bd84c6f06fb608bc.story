A 30-year-old man has been charged with terror offences as part of an investigation into a friend of one of the suspected Woolwich killers, Scotland Yard said last night.

Shah Jalal Hussain was arrested at an address in east London yesterday morning.

He faces two charges connected to the alleged dissemination of terrorist publications and will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court this morning.

The man has been arrested in connection with an investigation into Abu Nusaybah (pictured) who was arrested and charged with terror offences after he gave an interview on BBC Newsnight

His arrest is linked to an 
investigation into Abu Nusaybah, also known as Ibrahim Abdullah-Hassan, 
who was arrested and charged with terror offences after he gave an 
interview on BBC Newsnight.

Hussain is accused of allowing others 
to access the video of a lecture, given by Khalid al-Husainan, and a 
text called Reality of the Rulers written by Abu Zubair Adil al-Adab and
by doing so, encouraging or inducing the commission, preparation or 
instigation of acts of terrorism.

Both alleged offences fall under the Terrorism Act 2006 and are alleged to have taken place on or before May 24.

Abu Nusaybah was arrested and charged with three counts under the Terrorism Act but these are not linked to the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby

Investigation: The scene where Drummer Lee Rigby died in Woolwich on May 22

Nusaybah, who appeared in court over 
three terror charges, claimed that Michael Adebolajo, his friend who is 
accused of murdering soldier Lee Rigby, had been offered a job by MI5.

Nusaybah, of Walthamstow,
east London, faced three charges relating to filmed recordings of 
lectures and written text when he appeared at Westminster Magistrates 
Court last week.

He was remanded in custody by District Judge Howard Riddle and will appear at the Old Bailey on June 28.
