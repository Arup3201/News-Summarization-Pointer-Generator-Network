The UK’s borders offer ‘no hurdles’ for British jihadis returning from Iraq and Syria intent on launching a ‘massacre of the innocents’, it was claimed last night.

A former policeman warned that Islamist fighters who had sneaked out of the country ‘under the radar’ of the police and security services would be ‘welcomed home’ by inadequate immigration controls at British airports.

And he raised the terrifying prospect that unknown extremists could cause carnage on UK streets using terror tactics learned on Middle East battlefields, such as building homemade bombs.

Warning: Chris Hobbs, former immigration officer, said calls to bolster border controls has fallen on deaf ears

Chris Hobbs, a retired Special Branch officer who worked intercepting suspected criminals at UK airports for more than ten years, said repeated calls to successive Home Secretaries to bolster border controls had ‘fallen on deaf ears’.

He said ministers were more concerned with preventing queues at airports than protecting the public – a claim described as ‘utter rubbish’ by the Home Office.

Mr Hobbs spoke out after Labour MP Khalid Mahmood claimed that as many as 2,000 British Muslims had travelled to fight a ‘holy war’ in Iraq and Syria. The security services claim the number is 500, with 250 having already returned.

The Metropolitan Police veteran, who served 32 years before leaving in 2011, said it was ‘scandalous’ that embarkation controls had not been reintroduced after being scrapped by Labour in 1998.

These controls were staffed by immigration officers who would examine passports and scrutinise passengers as they passed through to their flights. Suspicious people would be flagged up to Special Branch.

But Mr Hobbs said that nowadays body and hand baggage searches and passport checks would be conducted by private security guards employed by airport authorities or airline personnel as they boarded their planes.

He claimed ‘99 out of 100’ passengers would not pass ‘under the eyes’ of a UK counter-terrorism officer.

Instead, hard-pressed officers would monitor ‘target’ flights at the airport gates – those heading for certain destinations. For instance, flights to Turkey – often used as a transit point by British Muslims travelling to Syria – might be monitored. 

Fears: More than 500 Britons are feared to be fighting for ISIS  and could come home

Mr Hobbs said that on their return to Britain, extremists who had not come to the attention of the security services would face little attention at passport control. He said UK Border Force officers were discouraged from asking even the most basic questions of travellers.

Instead they simply scan passports against terror and criminal watchlists and compare the photograph in the document with the person in front of them – another claim vehemently denied by the Home Office.

Mr Hobbs said: ‘The medieval savagery inflicted upon James Foley by, in all probability, a British national and the perceived support of the UK government for those ranged against this so-called Islamic State can only bring the prospect of a “massacre of the innocents” in the UK even closer.

‘There is clearly still a very real need to prevent further individuals from leaving the UK to engage in acts of terror in other parts of the world.

‘An equal priority needs to ensure that jihadists returning to the UK are detected and arrested before they can inflict mayhem in our towns and cities.

‘If that means that the priority of avoiding air and sea port passenger queues has to be removed then so be it.

‘Police and security services have performed outstandingly well in frustrating a number of planned attacks yet the increasing numbers of UK jihadists suggests that their task is becoming almost impossible.

‘Thus the case for strengthening our borders by reintroducing exit controls and strengthening passport controls upon arrival is surely an unanswerable one. Currently there are practically no hurdles.’

Mr Mahmood, MP for Birmingham Perry Barr, said: ‘The Government has not got a handle on how to deal with people coming in and out of the country – people are coming and going as they please without being asked any questions.

‘They might have been in the Middle East for education or employment, but at least ask them.’

The Home Office said embarkation controls were being reintroduced next spring to boost intelligence on who was in the UK.

A source at the department said border officers had vast terror and criminal databases at their fingertips. Some 95 per cent of travellers arriving at Britain’s airports underwent checks.

He said border officers routinely questioned arriving passengers and said it was ‘utter rubbish’ to suggest the Border Force prioritised queues over security.
