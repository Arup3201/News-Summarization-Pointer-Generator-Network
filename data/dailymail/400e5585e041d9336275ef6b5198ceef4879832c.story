An 18-year-old student who fell asleep during a taxi ride home after a night out, found himself invited into the driver's house.

Mike Allison, from Northwich, Cheshire, had been celebrating a friend's birthday in Manchester earlier this month and was mistakenly left behind as the group got out of the ride home.

When the driver discovered the A-level student at the back of his minibus at 4.30am, he kindly offered some warmth for the teenager.

Hero driver: Student Mike Allison posted this picture, captioned: 'Fell asleep in the taxi and none woke me up. Now I'm back at the taxi man's house in Stretford watching take me out (sic).'

Mr Allison and his friends had enjoyed a night of celebration in Deansgate, and had arranged for a minibus to pick them up, arriving home at around 4am.

However, Mr Allison's friends failed to see that he was still left in the taxi, so the sleeping teen remained in the vehicle until the driver got home to Stretford, more than 20 miles away.

'I looked around and couldn't see anyone, and so thought one of my drinks had been spiked and that I had been kidnapped or something!,' the student told Buzzfeed.

'The taxi driver was still in the front at this point, so I shouted up to him, asking where the hell we were.'

Mr Allison did not want to pay the £50 fee to be driven back to Northwich, so the kind driver offered to let him wait inside his home while he arranged a lift back.

'So I go into his house, and he offers me a brew and some food. I stayed there for about an hour watching Take Me Out.'

Mr Allison posted a picture of the  strange twist of fate on his Twitter, a snap which has since gone viral.

'Fell asleep in the taxi and none woke me up. Now I'm back at the taxi man's house in Stretford watching take me out(sic),' the teenager wrote. 

Unfortunately for the A-level student, his night did not end when he left the driver's house.

Mr Allison, who hopes to study real estate at university next year, told MailOnline, After I left his house at 5.30am, it took me another two hours to find my lift home because my phone died.'
