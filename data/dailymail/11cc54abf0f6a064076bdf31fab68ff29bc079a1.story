Lawyers for Boston 
Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev have asked to move his 
upcoming trial from Boston, proposing Washington, D.C., as the new 
location.

In a motion filed in U.S. District 
Court late Wednesday, Tsarnaev's public defenders said a survey of 
potential jurors in Boston, Springfield, New York City and Washington 
suggests the nation's capital would be a more suitable location for a 
trial.

The lawyers, who cautioned that they 
still need more time to study the issue, said Boston residents were the 'most prejudiced' on a number of critical measures, based on the May 
survey's preliminary findings.

Lawyers for Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev have asked to move his upcoming trial from Boston, proposing Washington, D.C., as the new location

Among Boston 
respondents aware of the case, they said, nearly 58 per cent 'definitely'
 believed Tsarnaev was guilty and 37 per cent believed that if convicted 
he deserved the death penalty.

More than 50 per cent of Boston 
respondents said they or someone they knew had participated in or 
attended last year's marathon, at which three people were killed and 
more than 260 others were injured.

About 37 
per cent of Washington residents surveyed 'definitely' believed Tsarnaev 
was guilty, 19 per cent said he deserved the death penalty and about 12 
per cent said they or someone they knew had participated in or attended 
the marathon.

Prosecutors say Tsarnaev and his
 brother planted two bombs that exploded near the finish line of the 
2013 marathon.

His brother died following a shootout with police several
 days later.

Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty to 30 federal charges. His trial is expected to begin in November.

Tsarnaev's
 lawyers said their motion has precedent: They noted that 'tremendous 
local impact and galvanizing community reaction' prompted the trial of 
Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh to be transferred to Denver in 
1996.

The lawyers argue that the marathon bombings present an even greater impact to the Boston-area community.

They
 pointed to the 'trauma' of the four-day police search, capped by the 
dramatic final day, on which thousands of Boston-area residents were 
ordered to shelter in place until Tsarnaev was found.

Defense
 lawyers also noted the intense and sustained media coverage after the 
bombings and the ever-present 'Boston Strong' billboards, T-shirts and 
other paraphernalia.

The request to change trial venues capped a busy day in the case.

Earlier,
 U.S. District Court Judge George O'Toole ruled that 'betrayal of the 
United States' should not be among the factors prosecutors cite when 
arguing whether Tsarnaev, who lived in the former Soviet republic of 
Kyrgyzstan and in Russia before moving to the U.S., gets the death 
penalty if convicted.

The judge said it was 'highly inappropriate' for prosecutors to draw a distinction between a 'naturalized' and a 'natural-born' U.S. citizen.

Federal
 prosecutors have argued, in part, that Tsarnaev, 20, deserves the death
 penalty because he betrayed his allegiance to the country that granted 
him asylum and later citizenship.

Tsarnaev's attorneys have said the argument is unprecedented in death penalty cases.

The
 judge on Wednesday also denied a request by Tsarnaev's lawyers to allow
 them to meet with their client and his sisters in prison without 
federal agents present.

Instead, prosecutors agreed to have an FBI agent
 or other federal official not assigned to the case monitor the 
meetings, for security purposes.

And the judge
 issued a stern warning to prosecutors about former or current members 
of their team speaking to the media.

The warning came after the defense 
objected to interviews retired FBI agents gave around the April 
anniversary of the bombings.

Prosecutors said the interviews contained 
information already public.
