Snooker star Ronnie O'Sullivan 'cheated death' when his sports car spun out of control on the motorway as he made his way home after losing the snooker World Championships.

Little more than three hours after Mr O'Sullivan lost the tournament's final game to Mark Selby, the 38-year-old and his son were involved in the dramatic crash on the M1 near Leicester.

His young son Ronnie Junior, six, was alongside his father in the two-seater sports car when it hit the motorway's central reservation in the early hours of this morning.

Snooker star Ronnie O'Sullivan's sports car was believed to have spun out of control on a motorway as he made his way home following the snooker World Championships

But the pair incredibly walked away 'without a scratch' after the crash.

They were returning to Mr O'Sullivan's home in Chigwell, Essex, from the  world-famous Crucible Theatre in Sheffield after the snooker favourite was defeated by 14 frames to 18 in the snooker World Championships.

Mr O'Sullivan and Ronnie Jnr, one of his two children with ex-partner Jo Langley, were able to climb free of the wreckage and were said to be 'shaken' by the incident, which occurred at around 1.30am, but not seriously hurt.

It is believed that the car drove through a patch of standing water on the motorway before hitting the central reservation, and that alcohol was not a factor in the crash. 

Mr O'Sullivan's manager Sonny Nath told MailOnline that Mr O'Sullivan and Ronnie Jnr had not been injured in the smash.

'Both Ronnie and his son were not hurt at all and are fine,' he said.

Mr O'Sullivan's spokesman Justin Rigby confirmed he was unhurt - and added that there was no suggestion Mr O'Sullivan was speeding or drinking before the crash.

'He wasn't that bad, he's not got a scratch on him,' said Mr Rigby.

'He's back home again now. There's no problem with drink driving.'

He added: 'He's fine and his son is fine, they're not injured at all.'

Mr O'Sullivan had said after the final that he had 'never been in such a good place' despite the defeat.

'He (Selby) out-fought me, out-battled me and I've got no complaints. I fought my hardest,' the Rocket told fans.

Police
 were unable to confirm whether it had been Mr O'Sullivan involved in 
the crash, but said that officers had attended an incident on the south 
bound stretch of the motorway, close to junction 21, early this morning.

'We
 did have a road traffic collision on the M1 south bound at about 1.30 
in the morning, there was an adult and a child in that vehicle,' a 
Leicestershire Police spokesman told MailOnline.

The spokesman added that no one was injured in the collision, which involved just one vehicle - an Audi R8.

She added that the car had been recovered following the crash as it was 'too damaged' to be driven away.

Mr O'Sullivan split with former 
partner Ms Langley in 2008 and is currently engaged to former Holby City
 actress Laila Rouass, who he has been in a relationship with since 
2012.

Ms Rouass, who came 
fourth in 2009's Strictly Come Dancing, had tweeted that she was at The 
Crucible, later writing 'Unlucky. Congrats to Selby,' after her fiance's
 defeat.

She took to twitter
 today after the crash, writing: 'To all who are asking, the two Ronnies
 are fine. Thank you for your concern and support. Back to a little 
normality x'

Concern: Ms Rouass took to Twitter to reveal that her fiance and his son, who she dubbed 'The Two Ronnies' were fine

Protege: Mr O'Sullivan, pictured in 1992, rose to prominence the following year when at just 17 years and 358 days he won the UK Championship

Throughout his career, which spans more than 20 years, Ronnie O'Sullivan has won countless titles, but has also made headlines for his actions away from the table.

Known to fans as 'The Rocket', Mr 
O'Sullivan rose to prominence when in 1993 at just 17 years and 358 days
 he won the UK Championship, becoming the youngest player ever to win a 
professional ranking tournament - a record which still stands.

Mr O'Sullivan, who was born in Wordsley, West Midlands, and grew up in Chigwell, Essex, is also the youngest player ever to have won the Masters, having 
captured his first title two years later in 1995 when he was 19 years 
and 69 days old.

During his 
career, Mr O'Sullivan has scooped five World Championship, five Masters,
 and four UK Championship titles, and is known as a prolific 
break-builder - holding the record for the most ratified maximum breaks 
in professional competition, with 12.

Prior to yesterday's defeat he had been the firm favourite to take the Dafabet World Championship title, after wins in 2012 and 2013.

In 1996 the snooker star received a two-year suspended ban, a £20,000 fine and was advised to donate a further £10,000 to charity after snooker's governing body found him guilty of assaulting media official Mike Ganley during the World Championships.

Later that year he was accused of bad sportsmanship after he played a number of shots left-handed during the 10-3 defeat of the French Canadian Alain Robidoux.

In 1998 he was stripped of the Irish Masters title because he had tested positive for marijuana.

Mr O'Sullivan has had well-documented 
problems with drink, drugs and depression during his colourful career, 
and has had spells in the priory clinic to treat his issues.

In his 2013 autobiography Running, he claimed he had 'pushed his luck' by taking drugs during his career, to the point where he was desperate for tournaments to be over in order to avoid being tested.

'When I was having my weekly benders and my private life was in bits, I had a brilliant year professionally,' he wrote.

'I
 remember getting to every World Championship and thinking, ''I can't 
wait til this tournament is over 'cos then there's no more drug tests, I
 can go out and smash it''.

'I'd
 got caught once in my career, but that's all. I'd get tested between 
events, and I was trying to judge it perfectly so there'd be no drugs 
left in my system, but I was pushing my luck.

'My mum said to me, ''You are going to get caught soon. You can't carry on like this''.'

His
 father, Ronnie O'Sullivan senior, spent 17 years in jail for murder 
after the brutal stabbing of Bruce Bryan, a driver to the gangster 
Charlie Kray, in a nightclub in Chelsea in 1992.
