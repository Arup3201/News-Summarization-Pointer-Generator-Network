We are led to believe that taking exercise and eating our greens are the secret to longevity.

But it seems other, more enjoyable, pursuits might also contribute.

The world’s oldest person, Misao Okawa, says the key to a long life is eating sushi and getting at least eight hours sleep a night.

Misao Okawa, 115, will turn 116 on Wednesday and she is the world's oldest person

Mrs Okawa, from Osaka in Japan, will turn 116 on Wednesday - she was born in 1898.

When she was born, Queen Victoria was on the throne and the Spanish American War was raging, The Telegraph reports.

She told the paper: ‘Eat and sleep and you will live a long time. You have to learn to relax.’

Mrs Okawa, whose husband, Yukio Okawa, died in June 1931 – 83 years ago, has been the world’s oldest person since the death of 116-year-old Jireomon Kimura in June 2013.

He remains the world’s oldest ever man.

‘Mrs Okawa eats three large meals a day and makes sure that she sleeps eight hours a night,’ Tomohito Okada, the head of the Kurenai retirement home where she lives, told The Telegraph.

He added: ‘She insists that her favourite meal is sushi, particularly mackerel on vinegar-steamed rice, and she has it at least once every month.’

Mrs Okawa is also known to have made every attempt to stay active for as long as possible.

When she was 102 she was found doing leg squats ‘to keep her body in shape’.

Mrs Okawa says that the happiest moments of her life were her wedding and the birth of her three children – she still has a surviving son and daughter who are now 94 and 92.

Her children have also given her four grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.

She says the saddest moment of her life was the death of her husband.

Experts say it is no surprise that both of the last two oldest people have been Japanese.

Mrs Okawa recommends that people eat sushi, learn to relax and that they sleep for at least eight hours a night

They say it is down to an excellent healthcare system, encouragement to stay active in old age and a healthy diet made up of fish, rice and fruit.

The life expectancy for a Japanese woman is almost 86 years while the average for a Japanese man is 79.6 years.

The average life expectancy in the UK is about 80.

The oldest authenticated person ever was Jeanne Louise Calment of France, who died at the age of 122 years and 164 days.

However, plenty of others have claimed to be even older – their claims have just been unverifiable.
