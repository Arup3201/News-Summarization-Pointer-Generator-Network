Karl Fellows, 29, was rushed to hospital after being punched unconscious by a thug during a football game on New Year's Day

A football player has been left with horrific injuries after a single punch broke his jaw and teeth following a brutal attack on the pitch.

Karl Fellows, 29, was rushed to hospital after being punched unconscious by another player during a semi-professional game on New Year's Day.

The Aston Villa coach - who also plays for Stourport Swifts -  spent three hours under the knife as surgeons battled to save his shattered jaw. 

Medics inserted a plate and four screws to repair the battered bone, after the Midland Football League Premier Division match away at Walsall Wood FC.

Mr Fellows said he was attacked in the 30th minute by a 21-year-old opposition player - who has not yet been named. 

Fortunately an off duty nurse who happened to be watching the game rushed to help the father-of-one. 

But he now needs surgery to repair his teeth and jaw. 

He said: 'I can't really remember much of it, because I was completely knocked out by the blow.

'But I know the punch came from behind. I was running back towards my goal to get the ball, and the next minute I was waking up in hospital.

'I'm still in excruciating pain, I can't believe what has happened to me, I was just playing football.

'When I went under the knife I was just supposed to be there for an hour, but they found my jaw was so badly broken they needed to do more work to save it.

'The x-rays show the damage was so bad they have had to cut in from the outside rather than just through my open mouth.

'That means I will have scars on the inside and outside of my mouth for the rest of my life.

'My face has been swollen, and my teeth are now completely rearranged.

'They said they managed to get the back teeth back in place, but it would take years and years for the front ones to come back, and they may well never do.

'I don't think I will play again, not how I feel at the moment, it's scary to think that could happen when you're just there to play.

Karl Fellows is helped by a team mate on the ground being treated for his injury. Chris Reynolds, chairman of Stourport Swifts, said he had written to football league officials to complain about the incident

Mr Fellows, 29, from Solihull, West Midlands. Karl was assaulted and left unconscious with a broken jaw while playing for the Stourport Swifts in an away game at Walsall Wood FC on New Year's Day

'I coach football to young people and it is all about teaching respect. Players will always be injured, but being attacked, like I was, was disgusting.'

His father Paul, 55, also from Solihull, said he was left 'horrified' by the incident.

He added: 'I wasn't at the game but I got a call from Karl who could barely speak. I couldn't believe it when he told me what had happened.

'I've been refereeing football games for more than 20 years and I've never heard of an incident like it.

'Karl lives and breathes football. To think that this will put him off playing again breaks my heart.'

Chris Reynolds, chairman of Stourport Swifts, said he had written to football league officials to complain about the incident.

He added: 'I'm appalled. Behaviour like that should not be tolerated, on or off the pitch.'

A spokesman for Walsall Wood FC said that the incident had begun with a Walsall Wood player being fouled from behind by a Stourport Swifts player, who then spat on their team member.  

Whilst the club stressed that it in in no way condones violence, it added that the incident would never have occurred but for the initial spitting offence.

A West Midlands Police spokesperson added: 'A 21-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of assault at Walsall Wood FC's ground near Aldridge at around 4pm on New Year's Day.

'He has since been bailed for further questioning later this month.'
