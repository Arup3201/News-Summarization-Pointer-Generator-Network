John Grisham has apologized for saying  that many men imprisoned for child pornography offenses in the U.S. probably just had too much to drink and 'pushed the wrong buttons.'

Grisham said in a recent interview that U.S. prisons were 'filled with guys my age. Sixty-year-old white men in prison who have never harmed anybody, would never touch a child.'

'Anyone who harms a child for profit or pleasure, or who in any way participates in child pornography—online or otherwise—should be punished to the fullest extent of the law,' he said in a statement today.

 Sorry: Author John Grisham (above) released a statement today apologizing for comments he made about men who watch child porn being punished too harshly.

He then added, 'My comments made two days ago during an interview with the British newspaper The Telegraph were in no way intended to show sympathy for those convicted of sex crimes, especially the sexual molestation of children. I can think of nothing more despicable. I regret having made these comments, and apologize to all.' 

In his interview, which was with The Telegraph, he stated that many of those jailed on charges of child porn did not do anything wrong.

'We've got prisons now filled with guys my age, 60-year-old white men, in prison, who have never harmed anyone,' he said. 

'Who would never touch a child, but they got online one night, started surfing around, probably had too much to drink whatever and pushed the wrong buttons, and went too far and went into child porn or whatever.' 

Grisham made a distinction between 'real pedophiles' and those he said were being punished too harshly. 

He said offenders did deserve punishment, but 'we've gone nuts with this incarceration.' 

He also revealed he has a friend serving time in prison for watching child porn in Canada.

These comments caused public outrage among many, some of whom took to Twitter to attack the author. 

Child welfare advocates also criticized the comments, which were made during an interview to promote Grisham's latest legal thriller, Gray Mountain.

Jon Brown of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children told the BBC that 'every image is a real child who has suffered and every time these images are clicked on or downloaded it creates demand that ultimately fuels more child abuse.'
