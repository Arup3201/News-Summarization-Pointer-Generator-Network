A pet shop owner and her boyfriend are living in their own homemade jungle - with meerkats, a six-legged tortoise and even a skunk called Lily.

Alyss Dickinson, 23, and partner Andy Rogers, 41, also live with 22 snakes, five 
tarantulas, two lizards, a barn owl called Barney and an exotic racoon dog called Freddie.

The couple, who met through their mutual love for animals, even take their beloved skunk for walks on a lead around their neighbourhood in Lincoln.

Animal-mad pet shop owner Alyss Dickinson, 23, from Lincoln, cuddles up every night in bed with her beloved skunk, Lily

Miss Dickinson, who lives with her boyfriend Andy Rogers and his two children, has a horde of pets, including 22 snakes, two lizards, three parrots - and this Barn Owl, called Barney

The couple's homemade zoo includes Jade, a green tree Python, pictured with Mr Rogers, and Sid, a Royal Python, pictured with Miss Dickinson

The animal-mad couple also custom-built a £3,000 summer-house extension for their meerkats, Alex and Serge, which they use as aplayground.

But, at night, the meerkats are brought inside the family home to cuddle on the sofa - while Lily and Freddie sleep with the couple in their bed.

Miss Dickinson said Lily cuddles up to her while she sleeps and is litter trained, just like any other pet.

She said: 'We love snuggling up with the 
girls in the evening and playing with Alex, Serge, Freddie and Lily. 
They are amazing pets and love being tickled and stroked just like any 
other animal.'

Their parrot Jackson is part of the family, which also includes five tarantulas and meerkats

The couple also converted their dining room into a specialised reptile house - which contains thousands of pounds worth of equipment.

The pair, who met through the pet shop which Ms Dickinson owns, spend £150 each month on their pets' special diet of mice, rats and quails.

The couple’s first skunk Phoebe, who died recently, also cost them £10,000 in healthcare.

Miss Dickinson said: 'People gawp at us when they see us coming, it’s really funny.

The family, which includes Hannah Rogers, 12, also have an Umbrella 
White Cockatoo Parrot called Romeo, a Jack Russell dog called Mouse, a 
parrot called Jimmy, a six-legged tortoise called Bob Bearded Dragon and
 a panther chameleon called Rango

'We’re always getting stopped and people ask us what the animals are. Some people might say we’re mad but we don’t care, we love our unusual family.'

Miss Dickinson took over the Lincoln Reptile and Pet Centre in 2010 when she was 19.

A few months later, she persuaded her mother Wendy, 54, to buy the shop with her.

Their skunk Lily and her animal siblings set the couple back £150 per month in food and they have also spent £3,000 building a specialist meerkat home extension

Her love affair with the weird and wonderful animals grew. She soon met Mr Rogers and they moved in together - complete with their horde of animals.

She said: 'Thank goodness Andy knew me through work and already knew what I was like or he might have had a fit when I moved all the animals in!'

The couple also have to make room for 
Andy’s two daughters Hannah, 12, and Izzie, four, who are squeezed into a
 bedroom in the three bed terraced house.
