View point: Professor John Ashton, president of the Faculty of Public Health, says people should be enabled to end their life where the alternative would cause 'major' suffering

Patients should be helped to die by their GP if they so wish, a leading doctor has said.

Professor John Ashton, president of the Faculty of Public Health, has said in his view people should be enabled to end their life where the alternative would cause ‘major’ suffering.

Professor Ashton, who has spent almost 40 years working in public health,  is one of the most senior health professionals to speak out in favour of assisted suicide.

He told The Guardian: ‘All over the country people are spending their last days and weeks in major discomfort because their medical carers are not willing to accept that it’s the end of the line and to give them the necessary sedation to just speed things up a bit.

‘I think a significant proportion of the population would like to feel confident that if it came to the crunch they could call on their doctor to help them out … if their quality of life is so poor and that it’s only a matter of days or weeks anyway, that they would like to be able to draw down that gift of a [medical] practitioner.’

The veteran public health expert, who retired last year, stressed he was speaking in a personal capacity on the subject but said he would be content for doctors ‘to stop treatment, to be more ready to prescribe the sort of medication … that means they will be more likely to [die] sooner rather than later.’

Professor Ashton, who leads more than 3,300 public health experts working in the NHS, local government and academia,  added: ‘When doctors take this strident view that doctors won’t get involved in this in any way I don’t think they are in tune with what the public want to be able to get from their advisers. There is a narrow line between actively taking someone’s life and supporting their passing, and that’s the art of medicine.

‘Personally, I would like that for myself if I was in this position. I would like to be able to call on a doctor to help me take this last step.’

The doctor’s controversial comments came as he also said Britain should switch to a four-day working week to combat stress.

Combat stress: Prof Ashton also said Britain should switch to a four-day working week, adding that workers no longer took a lunch hour and ate at their desks

He said shorter hours would allow workers to spend more time with their families and would help combat medical conditions such as high blood pressure and mental health problems.

‘We should be moving towards a four-day week because we problem we have in the world of work is you’ve got a proportion who are working too hard and a proportion that haven’t got jobs,’ he said.

‘We’ve got a maldistribution of work.  The lunch-hour has gone; people just have a sandwich at their desk and carry on working.’

‘We need a four-day week so that people can enjoy their lives, have more time with their families and maybe reduce high blood pressure because people might start exercising on that extra day.

‘If you’ve got two people in a couple working, they need to be able to work in such a way that they can spend time together with their children.  It’s a nightmare.’
