A San Diego man accused of shooting his ex-wife dead and then trying to commit suicide by inhaling the fumes of a gas generator claims the smoking cessation drug Chantix played a role in the killing.

Defense attorneys for Tim Danielson, 65, say he was suffering depression when he shot his former wife Ming Qi, 48, in the Lakeside home they shared.

They say the depression was caused by Chantix, which Danielson began taking weeks before Qi's death.

Chantix defense: Timothy Danielson is expected to give evidence about how Chantix affected his mental state during his trial

The Chantix website warns that the drug's possible side effects include 'hostility, agitation, depressed mood, suicidal thoughts or actions.'

According to ABC 10, the judge hearing Danielson's case allowed expert testimony about what role the drug may have played in Danielson's state of mind at the time of the shooting.

UT San Diego reported that Danielson, a former high school champion distance runner who worked as an engineer, and Qi, a Chinese national and university professor whom he met online, married in 2006 and divorced in 2008.

Shot by former husband: Ming Qi was shot six times by Danielson, who then attempted to gas himself to death

At the time of her death, Ming Qi had moved into her former husband's home due to financial difficulties.

The pair shared the home but had separate bedrooms.

Sometime between 9pm and midnight on Sunday June 13, 2011, the pair fought.

The prosecutor in the case said the pair argued after Danielson discovered Qi was dating another man.

Danielson was 'trying to kick her out of the home; she was dating someone else,' the prosecutor said, reported UT San Diego.

Danielson
 retrieved a .22 caliber rifle and shot Qi 'as she was attempting to run
 away. When she was down on the ground, he put the rifle to her head and
 pulled the trigger,' according to District Attorney Mike McCann. Ming 
Qi was shot six times.

Danielson then carried her body upstairs to his bedroom and turned on a generator to kill himself by carbon monoxide poisoning.

He
 sent an email to his sister-in-law telling her what he had done 
sometime after midnight. She notified police and they discovered 
Danielson and the body of Ming Qi in the early hours of Monday morning.

Danielson was reportedly near death.

He is expected to take the stand and tell jurors about how Chantix affected his mind.

Criminal defense attorney Jan Ronis told ABC 10 that mental defenses are  'not very popular, but it sounds to me like it's the only defense there is.'

'Previously, it was called diminished capacity, now it's called diminished actuality,' explained Ronis. 'It's a murky area of law that still provides somewhat of a defense, and as I mentioned this may be an only defense if this is not a whodunit.'

Warning: Chantix now carries the FDA's strongest safety warning because of its possible side effects, including suicidal thoughts and aggression

The New York Times reports that at a court hearing five months after the shooting, Danielson's lawyer Paul Pfingst suggested that Danielson was confused that June day in 2011, he 'didnâ€™t know what was going on' and thought 'something was seriously wrong with his brain' and wondered if he actually killed Qi or whether it was 'all a dream.'

Tim Danielson pleaded not guilty and has been awaiting trial without bail since 2011.

More than 2,700 lawsuits, now consolidated, have been filed against Pfizer, the manufacturer of Chantix, alleging that the drug caused suicidal thoughts, aggressive and erratic behavior, depression and loss of memory in patients.

In recent months, Pfizer has settled two high-profile test cases, but has maintained that the drug is safe to use.

As of July 1, 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires Chantix to carry a black box warning, the agency's strongest safety warning, due to public reports of side-effects including depression, suicidal thoughts, and suicidal actions.

Jury selection in Danielson's trial begins Wednesday.
