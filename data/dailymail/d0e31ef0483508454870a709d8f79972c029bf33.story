Rioting prisoners barricaded themselves in a wing at Britain's largest G4S-run prison for a staggering nine hours, it has been revealed.

Around 20 inmates staged a protest between 5pm yesterday and 2am today at scandal-hit HMP Oakwood in Wolverhampton, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) and G4S said.

They damaged cells, threatened guards and destroyed property at the £150million super-prison, dubbed 'Jokewood' because of its slack security.

However, no staff were injured during the riot - with only one prisoner being treated for minor injuries.

Earlier reports had claimed that up to 40 inmates had taken two guards hostage in D wing, before demanding McDonald's meals were brought to their cells.

At the time, one prisoner, who did not wish to be named, revealed: 'There are 40 people who have barricaded themselves in with pool tables.

'They’re making silly demands like wanting McDonald's brought to their cells. They’re just drunk.

'First class': Justice Secretary Chris Grayling recently praised the facilities at HMP Oakwood

'They’ve taken two prison staff hostage and there are loads of police here trying to get it under control, but they haven’t.'

However, G4S and the MoJ have since dismissed the claims as 'completely untrue'.

A joint statement read: 'The
 disruption, which was confined to one wing of the Category C prison for
 male prisoners, began just after 5pm on Sunday as prisoners were out of
 their cells on association, and involved around 15-20 prisoners, who 
threatened officers and caused damage to cells and prison property.

'A
 number of prisoners returned to their cells voluntarily. The Ministry 
of Justice was informed immediately, and standard procedures were 
initiated to deal with the incident, with rapid response teams deployed.
 Staffordshire Police were also informed.

'Owing to damage caused to cells, a number of prisoners were moved to other wings and to other prisons in the area.

'The
 incident was brought under control just after 2am without injury to any
 prison officers, although one prisoner has been treated for minor 
injuries.

'Reports of 
prison staff being taken hostage are completely untrue. The safety of 
our personnel and those prisoners in our care is our top priority, and 
we are grateful to our colleagues who were able to help us bring the 
incident to a close safely, and effectively.

'Established incident procedures were followed correctly and worked as they were meant to.

'Untrue': Earlier reports claimed that inmates had taken two guards hostage, before demanding McDonald's meals were brought to their cells. However, G4S and the MoJ have since dismissed the claims as false

'As
 an investigation has now commenced into the reasons for this 
disruption, as well as a criminal investigation, it would be 
inappropriate to comment further at this time.'

During the riot, prisoners are believed to have used pool cues to overpower guards.

Standard
 procedures were initiated to deal with the incident - with rapid response teams and officers from Staffordshire Police deployed to the prison.

HMP Oakwood - the largest prison in England and Wales - opened in April 2012 as a training prison next to the existing HMP Featherstone and HMP Brinsford near Wolverhampton.

Shock: Tonight former Home Secretary David Blunkett (pictured) called Mr Grayling's comments about HMP Oakwood 'astonishing'

It houses more
 than 1,600 category C prisoners and was the the scene of a number of rooftop 
protests last year.

The
 disturbance comes weeks after Justice Secretary Chris Grayling defended
 Oakwood as a ‘first class facility’ despite a
 string of problems, including a damning report from HM Inspectorate of 
Prisons.

The document, published in October, had reported inexperienced staff and high levels of violence and self-harm at the jail - with chief inspector of 
prisons Nick Hardwick warning there were 'real risks if matters were 
allowed to drift'.

Inspectors also revealed that
 hard drugs were 'easily available' inside the prison, that inmates 
brewed their own alcohol in their cells and that hardcore pornography 
was allowed to be displayed on prison walls.

At the time G4S said improvements were being made but admitted launching the prison was a 'complex and challenging operation'.

G4S - well-known for its botched handling of its Olympics security contract - has been under review by the Government following revelations it overcharged for criminal-tagging contracts.

The government has since announced that electronic monitoring will handed to another firm on an interim basis at the end of the financial year.

Tonight
 former Home Secretary David Blunkett said the Justice Select Committee 
is likely to demand an investigation and called Mr Grayling’s comments 
about HMP Oakwood ‘astonishing’.

He told the Daily Mail: ‘I know the 
Justice Select Committee will want to investigate what has happened, not
 least because G4S have been banned from taking on other prison service 
contracts that have recently been put out to tender.

‘It’s
 astonishing that Chris Grayling should have made his comments less than
 eight weeks ago. I think he will be regretting having been so 
effusive.’

The Labour 
MP, who served as Home Secretary under Tony Blair’s Government, added: 
‘I think that all the signals about HMP Oakwood have been there to 
provide sufficient warning that contrary to what the Justice Secretary 
believed, management didn’t have a grip on the situation.

‘Sometimes
 there are unforeseen eruptions in prisons, often due to overcrowding, 
but that is quite clearly not the case at Oakwood.

‘Therefore,
 there are some very important questions to be asked as to who has taken
 their eye off the ball and who should be held to account for what’s 
clearly a danger to prison officers and a breakdown of discipline in 
relation to those in prison.'
