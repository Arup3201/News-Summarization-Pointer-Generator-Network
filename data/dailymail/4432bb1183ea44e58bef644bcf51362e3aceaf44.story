The star-studded Cannes Film Festival is at the centre of a bitter sexism row because all entries for this year’s prestigious Palme d’Or are men. 

No less than 22 male directors will compete for the prize in the French Riviera resort this week.

This is despite women stars including Angelina Jolie - who will attend this year’s festival with Brad Pitt - and Madonna getting behind the camera to shoot films.  

Ignored: Female directors such as Angelina Jolie, left, and Madonna, right, have not been shortlisted for the Palme d'Or

It has led to a group of leading women directors writing an open letter to the Cannes organisers attacking the way ‘exclusively male films’ are being judged, and that ‘men love depth in women, but only in their cleavage’.  

The letter published in Le Monde also reads: ‘In Cannes, the women show off their show-reels, the men their films’, and that  actresses are solely celebrated for their ‘beauty, grace or lightness’.

Referring to the famous Palais de Festival in Cannes, it says that the general message was: ‘Above all, do not let young girls think that one day they might have the nerve to make films and climb the steps of the Palais other than on the arm of a prince charming.’  

The protestors point to the fact that an image of the American sex symbol Marilyn Monroe – who died 50 years ago – was being used on the official festival poster this year, and that talented women are mainly acting as comperes.

Berenice Bejo, the 35-year-old French-Argentinian actress who shot to fame in The Artist last year, will be hosting the opening and closing ceremonies, for example.   

Although stars like Jolie, Marion Cotillard, Kristine Stewart and Sharon Stone are expected on the Cannes red carpet this week, their main role will be to look beautiful.   

Among those signing the letter on behalf of a feminist collective called The Beard are the celebrated French women directors such as Coline Serreau, who received three Cesar awards for Three Men and a Cradle in 1985.   

Since the Cannes festival started in 1946 the Palme d’Or (or Palm of Gold) has gone to only one woman - New-Zealander Jane Campion for The Piano in 1993.  

Past male winners, meanwhile, include Cecil B. DeMille, David Lean, Mike Leigh and Martin Scorsese.  

But Thierry Fremaux, who is charge of the committee which selects the Cannes films, said he would never choose a film ‘that doesn’t deserve it just because it’s directed by a woman’.

Mr Fremaux said the lack of female directing talent reflected an industry-wide problem, and that ‘there is no doubt that women’s role needs to be improved.’
