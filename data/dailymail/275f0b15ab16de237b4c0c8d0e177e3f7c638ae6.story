A 14-year-old girl who went missing from her Sydney home earlier this week has been reunited with her emotional parents after she was found safe and well.

Krystal Muhieddine's parents Wally and Suzanne had made a desperate plea for information regarding the whereabouts of the teenager after she left her home in Hunters Hill, one of Australia's wealthiest suburbs on Tuesday morning.

She had last been seen getting into a silver hatchback with red P-plates driven by a teenage boy that was unknown to her parents.

But police found her with a boy in a coffee shop near the Aire River in Victoria today.

She hugged her parents as they were reunited later the same day after her parents flew in to Tullamarine Airport.

According to Mr Muhieddine, Krystal 
and the boy had been camping after the teenager grew 'angry and 
frustrated' at home and ran away.

He said that he and his wife will talk to Krystal in a bid to negotiate ways in which they can be 'better parents'.

He told Fairfax Media: 'We’re going 
to approach this from a position of negotiation, see what she would like
 and what’s satisfies us.

'Clearly what we’ve been doing hasn’t worked.

'Our heart goes out to parents who don’t get the same good news we received today.'

Fearing the worst, Mr and Mrs Muhieddine held a press conference earlier this week appealing for help to find their daughter.

Mr and Mrs Muhieddine said that their daughter was 'only a baby... she sleeps with her teddy bear'.

'You're not in trouble, no one is in trouble - we just want to know where you are and that you are safe,' Mrs Muhieddine told news.com.au.

Friends of Krystal said she had recently spoken about a boy.

Her
 parents said she might have been communicating with someone online 
before she disappeared despite a ban on social media websites in the 
family home, but her father was adamant she had never had a boyfriend.

'She's never dated anyone. She's never been anywhere without me dropping her off,' said Mr Muhieddine.

Last Friday, Krystal - the second youngest of four daughters - sneaked out of the house to see a movie, telling one of her sisters she had her mother's permission.

She later lied to Mrs Muhieddine, saying a friend's mother was planning to collect her.

After being reprimanded for her actions, the family then enjoyed a 'great weekend' together.

According to Gladsville Police, members of the public had come forward with information regarding Krystal's disappearance, but a spokesman said that wasn't how she was found.
