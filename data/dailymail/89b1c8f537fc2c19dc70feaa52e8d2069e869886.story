Nelson Mandela's condition was 
serious when he was admitted to hospital 13 days ago, but the 
94-year-old's health is improving, President Jacob Zuma has said.

The South African president, told 
members of the ruling African National Congress at the close of a party 
conference: 'His condition was serious but he is responding well to 
treatment and has steadily improved over the last few days.'

Mr Mandela was airlifted on December 8
from his rural village in the south of the country to a hospital in 
Pretoria for a series of tests.

Recovering: Nelson Mandela is recovering from an operation to remove gallstones, carried out in a private clinic in Pretoria

Doctors found the former president 
and hero of the anti-apartheid struggle had a recurrent lung infection 
and had developed gallstones.

He underwent surgery to remove the gallstones on December 15 and is still in hospital.

Mr Zuma sought to calm jitters over Mr Mandela's health.

'I have been informed that at his age
doctors need to intervene in a very gradual and sensitive way in order 
to maximise the chances of a full recovery,' he said.

'Madiba [Mr Mandela's clan name] is an
unparalleled fighter and has always been so. He has met all his health 
challenges with his tremendous fortitude and grace.'

The Nobel peace laureate has a long 
history of lung problems dating back decades to when he contracted 
tuberculosis while in jail as a political prisoner.

He was previously admitted to hospital
for an acute respiratory infection in January 2011, when he was kept as
an inpatient for two nights.

Mr Mandela became South Africa's first
black president after the country's first all-race elections in 1994 
and stepped down after serving one term.

The anti-apartheid leader is 
particularly susceptible to illness because of his age and his 27 years 
in prison, though medics say he is responding well to treatment.

He fought off a similar lung infection in 2011 and once contracted tuberculosis while imprisoned.

Medical experts say respiratory 
illnesses like pneumonia striking a man his age are a serious matter 
that require care and monitoring.

His ongoing hospitalisation 
has caused growing concern in South Africa, a nation of 50 million 
people that largely reveres him for being the nation's first 
democratically elected president who sought to bring the country 
together after centuries of racial division.

Tests at 1 
Military Hospital near South Africa's capital, Pretoria, detected the 
lung infection, presidential spokesman Mr Maharaj previously said in a statement.

'Madiba is receiving appropriate 
treatment and he is responding to the treatment,' Maharaj said, 
referring to Mr Mandela by his clan name as many do in South Africa as a
sign of affection.

In January 2011, Mr Mandela was 
admitted to a Johannesburg hospital for what officials initially 
described as tests but what turned out to be an acute respiratory 
infection.

The chaos that followed his stay at 
that public hospital, with journalists and members of the public surrounding it 
and entering wards, saw the South African military take charge of his 
care and the government control the information about his health.

The press and 
public have complained about the lack of concrete details that the 
government has released about the former president's condition.

They had not divulged why he had been
flown over 500 miles from his rural home to undergo the urgent tests 
prompting many to fear the worst.
