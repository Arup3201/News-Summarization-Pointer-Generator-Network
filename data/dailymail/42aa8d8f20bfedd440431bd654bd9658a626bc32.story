The meticulous attention to detail, the subject matter - not to mention the material used - all hark back to bygone days.

And sure enough this replica of Buckingham Palace made entirely out of matchsticks was built is a product of a less-frenzied time.

It began in 1957 when William Moir requested the palace plans from the Queen's superintendent.

Meticulous: The 90:1 scale model of Buckingham Palace assembled from 39,000 matchsticks

The talented modeller took nearly three years painstakingly making the 5ft long object and used 39,000 matchsticks.

After he died the delicate model was handed down to step-daughter Lillian Garner who kept it out of the reach of children on top of her wardrobe.

It was eventually inherited by her granddaughter Emily Edwards, who as a child used to stand on her nan’s bed and gaze at it during visits.

Mrs Edwards, 39, has now shown the incredibly detailed model off for the first time after taking it along to the BBC’s Antiques Roadshow.

She also still has the letter sent to her great-grandfather Mr Moir from Buckingham Palace along with the basic plan and measurements of the building that were enclosed.

Mrs Edwards said: ‘I always remember standing on my nan’s bed to look at this fantastic palace that has spent most of its life on top of her wardrobe.

‘The model is five feet long and she lived in a three-bed semi detached house in Middlesex so I don’t think she had the room for it.

‘She stored it on her wardrobe so it was out of the way but also to keep it safe from children.

‘She died a few years ago and the one thing I hoped to inherit was this model of Buckingham Palace.

‘But it went to her son and my uncle who, rather ironically, put it on top of his wardrobe due to a lack of room.

‘After three or four years he realised how much I liked it and gave it to me.

‘I keep it on a chest of drawers on my landing but it was only when the Antiques Roadshow visited the area that I thought about showing it to a wider audience.’

Mr Moir was a talented model-maker and went into great detail when creating the miniature palace, including getting the famous balcony absolutely right.

The windows are made out of clear perspex and he placed toy horses and a carriage in the front courtyard.

William Moir started building the model in 1957 after he was sent the plans and dimensions of the palace by the Queen's superintendent (cover letter pictured)

He placed it in a glass container which is still sits in today.

Mrs Edwards, from Bolton, now hopes to show the model off in local schools and museums.

It will feature on this Sunday’s Antiques Roadshow which was filmed at Port Sunlight on the Wirral.
