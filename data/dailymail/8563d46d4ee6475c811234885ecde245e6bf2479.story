Miami businessman Gino Bertuccio is one of the world’s luckiest flyers – and one of the most thoughtful as well.

The 52-year-old became the first person to fly in Etihad Airways’ £14,000 ‘penthouse in the sky’ at the weekend, and he shared the one-of-a-kind experience with friends and strangers.

While flying from London's Heathrow Airport to Abu Dhabi Mr Bertuccio opened the three-room private suite to first-class passengers, who were in an adjacent cabin, and invited a traveller from economy into the exclusive cabin, which boasts the world’s first in-flight butler.

He could have spent the entire seven-hour journey alone, using the time to retreat to the bedroom for a nap in its double bed or relax in the living room while sipping on drinks and flipping through programmes on its 32in television.

But he wanted to give others a look inside the ultra-luxurious cabin that costs £14,000 for a one-way flight.

Before flight EY12 landed in Abu Dhabi he invited a passenger from economy, who was selected at random by the butler, to join him for breakfast.

Mr Bertuccio, who owns an Italian cosmetic retailer, told MailOnline Travel: ‘I’ve been lucky enough to do this and I wanted to share it with someone.

The Residence boasts three rooms - a bedroom with a double bed, ensuite shower room and living room

‘I think it was something cool to share it with someone who probably may never be able to do that.

‘I consider myself very lucky and I’m glad I could share it with somebody else.’

The Residence is the jewel of Etihad’s new Airbus A380 superjumbo jet, which made its inaugural commercial flight between London and Abu Dhabi on Saturday.

It is the first of its kind and the only private cabin to come with a dedicated Savoy-trained butler.

People keep stopping Mr Bertuccio to find out what it was like to be the first person to fly in The Residence, which Etihad calls the world’s most exclusive airline seat, and how he passed the time.

After a limousine transfer to Heathrow and a few moments exploring the 125-square-foot suite, which includes an ensuite shower room, Mr Bertuccio opened it up to passengers from the first-class ‘apartments’, including friends and fellow aviation enthusiasts.

They held a draw and the winner joined him for dinner.

He said: ‘It was kind of like a party. There were people coming in and out, taking pictures of The Residence and chatting and drinking. It was more like a socialising event.’

After that he had a 90-minute power nap before sitting down for breakfast. A short time later the plane landed in Abu Dhabi and the experience was over.

Mr Bertuccio, who is originally from Italy, is an avid collector of airline memorabilia and has travelled on 22 inaugural and final flights in premium class cabins in the last 25 years.

He said nothing compared to flying in The Residence and he doesn’t know if he will experience anything that can top it, although he hopes to one day fly in the suite on a longer route.

He said: ‘This one is something different. The rooms are very comfortable even for big-sized guys like me, you can move around really easily.

‘Definitely, they are the most luxurious first-class cabins and residence cabins I have ever seen on any airline.

‘How it was designed, it feels like it’s a private jet. The Residence looks like a cruise liner cabin and nothing can compare to it.

‘I really want to thank Etihad for this memorable experience,  it’s definitely a once-in-a-lifetime experience. It was a great adventure.’
