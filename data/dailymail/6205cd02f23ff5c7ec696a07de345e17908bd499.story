Council bosses are merging two houses together to create a new super six-bedroom home for an unemployed couple and their ten children - at the expense of the taxpayer.

Tim Fisk, 43, and his pregnant partner Mandy Ball, 41, have between them ten children who live with them under one roof, two older ones who have moved out, and another baby due next month.

The couple, whose children in the house range from 15-years-old to eleven months, have lived at the property for about seven years.

Council bosses have ordered a wall be knocked through two homes to create one large one to accommodate Tim Fisk's sprawling family

Some 84 outraged neighbours and local residents have signed a petition to try and stop the council making one big home for Mandy Ball and her brood

Ipswich-born Mr Fisk used to work as a security guard for Nighthawk Security in Clacton, Essex, but hasn’t worked for several years.

Some 84 outraged neighbours and local residents have signed a petition opposing the scheme to knock two houses into one massive property in Ipswich.

But council bosses have ignored the protests and have given the controversial £6,000 blueprint for the construction to go-ahead.

Ipswich Borough Council chiefs snubbed local people's objections and protests to the radical project.

Now work is set to start later this week on converting the two three-bedroom council properties into one super home.

Builders will knock through an unoccupied house next door to where the family live, creating a new six-bedroom home.

The family of 12 will move into a six-bedroom council home at the taxpayers' expense after council chiefs granted permission for the walls between the buildings to be knocked through and transformed into one huge building

A council spokesman admitted it was a 'very unusual situation' but insisted it was the most 'cost-effective option' to meet the huge family's needs.

He said the work would be completed within two months and cost £6,000.

The family, who refused to comment last night, moved in to their home seven years ago.

The council spokesman said there are 3,203 people on their housing waiting list, with 391 of these eligible for three-bedroom homes.

He confirmed that 84 people signed the petition.

'This is a very unusual situation and not something we would normally contemplate doing.

'But, having reviewed all the options, we believe that this is the most cost-effective option to find a solution to this family's needs,' added the spokesman.

Ipswich Borough Council chiefs snubbed local people's objections and protests to the radical project and have given the go-ahead to the £6,000 project, which should take two months

'The alterations can be reversed in future. We have only one six-bedroom house in our stock.

'We have completed the structural surveys and will begin work on conversion soon.'.

A homeowner who supports the petition said he wants to protest at the 'waste of taxpayers' money'

The neighbour, who didn't want to be named, said: 'It's been empty for three months and another family could have moved in.

'The council is missing out on extra rent. This is absolutely ridiculous.'

He insisted: 'They could have built an extension instead; this has caused a real storm round here.'

Another neighbour, who declined to be named, said: 'She's been up here for seven, eight years, and she’s had a child every year.

'I just think it’s a total waste of taxpayers' money. The council should have had far more foresight than this.'

He added: 'They are like an ant colony. 'It’s like being stuck in the middle of a playground.

'She pumps out a child every year and they are giving them a mansion. I think it’s disgusting.'

Cllr Jim Powell, who represents the local Bridge council ward, said he supported the decision.

He said: 'They would have looked at the situation very carefully before coming to that conclusion.'
