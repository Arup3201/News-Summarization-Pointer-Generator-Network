Union representatives were condemned today after they told David Cameron to ‘go to Dignitas’.

Delegates to the Unite conference in Liverpool this week aimed a series of foul-mouthed insults at the Prime Minister and accused him of being a ‘racist and sexist pig’.

They were invited by organisers of the conference to ‘Stick it to Cameron’ by writing messages on notes before sticking them on two life-size cardboard cut outs of the PM.

Today the Tories described the postings as ‘atrocious’ and called on Ed Miliband to condemn them.

Around a dozen messages were left earlier this week, including one calling on the PM to kill himself at the Swiss suicide clinic.

One wrote: ‘We can have a whip round, to pay for your one way ticket to Dignitas’.

Another called on the PM to ‘Crawl back down the hole you came out of’.

They also branded him a ‘racist and sexist pig’, a ‘Moron’, a ‘Posh w*****’ and a ‘T***’.

Conservative Party Vice Chairman Bob Neill MP said: ‘Even by Unite’s standards this is a new low.

‘I hope Ed Miliband has the courage to condemn such atrocious behavior which has no place in public life.’

Astonishingly, a Unite spokesman refused to distance themselves from the posts, and refused to comment when contacted by the Mail.

It follows revelations on Wednesday that a senior Unite figure joked to delegates about rounding up the richest people in the world and killing them.

Assistant General Secretary Steve Turner said the spread of wealth in society was 'obscene'.

He said: 'Oxfam put in a report... on global wealth inequality. There are 85 people who have a combined wealth on this planet equivalent to the poorest 50 per cent on this planet.

‘I was accused of [wanting to] put them all on a London bus and wanting to kill them when I was talking in the House of Commons recently. Of course that wasn't the objective, if I was going to do that I would use a train carriage. You can't get enough people on a bus.'

He also said the union was demanding a Ministry for Labour and a powerful ‘Secretary of State for Trade Unions’ if Ed Miliband – who was backed by the union in the Labour leadership poll - gets in to Number 10.

Unite general secretary Len McCluskey used his conference in Liverpool to attack the Tories and urge Labour to back an in-out EU referendum

On Monday, Unite general secretary, 'Red' Len McCluskey, told Mr Miliband to 'bring home the bacon' for union members as Unite pledged to donate up to £12million to Labour's election campaign on top of the £12million given to the party since 2010.

Yesterday the union, the largest to affiliate to the Labour Party, urged Ed Miliband to back a referendum on EU membership. Unite said denying people a chance to vote on Britain's membership of the EU would be an ‘electoral millstone’ for Labour next May.

Mr McCluskey said: ‘It is time that Labour's leadership took a new look at the referendum question. We do not seek a referendum to take Britain out of the EU, we seek a referendum rethink in order to help Labour into power.

‘Without such a pledge, our party will stand exposed, Ukip will be strengthened in some key constituencies and the Tories will hypocritically charge Labour with being anti-democratic. In a tight election, this can make the difference.’

Delegates at the conference approved a motion urging Labour to ‘urgently reconsider’ the idea of a referendum.
