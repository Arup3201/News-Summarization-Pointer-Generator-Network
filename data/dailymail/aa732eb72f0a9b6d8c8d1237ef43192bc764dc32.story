Hundreds of rogue landlords in one London borough are illegally renting out 'beds in sheds' to immigrants on an industrial scale.

Harrow Council chartered a plane with thermal imaging to fly over streets picking up heat and found four times more 'suspicious' outbuildings than expected.

Aerial photos revealed that instead of 75 suspected illegal developments at the bottom of gardens or in garages, there were actually at least 319.

Welcome to Harrow: This is a thermal image of a street in the London borough. At the bottom of the picture is a road, and then a row of houses with heat escaping from windows. The circled building is at the bottom of a garden, and is believed to be a illegally converted outbuilding housing immigrants

Caught: A spy in the sky aeroplane with thermal imaging was chartered to find conversions. They can be seen because sheds and garages are generally not insulated, but houses are, so heat is seen in blocks of yellow

Officials believe more than 1,000 people could be living in cramped and squalid conditions costing around £55 per week, because they cannot afford a proper home.

The results mean they are probably living there without planning permission or contributing any council tax.

Beds in sheds - ultra basic accommodation used by 'exploited' immigrants paying reduced rents to rogue landlords who ignore planning laws - are believed to be an increasing problem nationwide, but especially in and around the capital.

Harrow Council flew over their borough at 3,379 feet between 9pm and midnight in January to gauge the scale of the problem.

They were looking for buildings with escaping heat - a tell-tale sign that it is an uninsulated 'shed' - as they are often hidden behind fences and cannot be seen by passers-by.

The council found one case with a person paying £55 a week to sleep on a mattress in a tiny room with two other people.

Concerns: Although many of the outbuildings are habitable, some are described as being unsafe, with little or no heating, or do not comply with building or fire safety regulations

The recent lift of immigration restrictions on Romanians and Bulgarians on January 1 has led to concerns that more beds in sheds will spring up.

And there was also a net increase in migration to the UK of 212,000 between September 2012 and September last year, according to Government figures.

Harrow Council leader, Councillor Susan Hall, said: 'The pressures of migration in London, fuelled by recent waves of new arrivals from Eastern Europe, are creating new stresses on local authorities that we just haven't had to contend with before.

'What was once thought even just 18 months ago to be a problem for the centre of big cities is now rippling out to the suburbs.

'The beds in sheds phenomenon means there is a hidden community springing up in the back gardens of our cities - in our borough alone the thermal pictures we receive suggest there are four times as many as we first suspected.

'These are people who use council services - like bin collections - but for whom we receive no extra funding.

'In many cases the people in beds in sheds are at the bottom of a pyramid of exploitation.

'But we get complaints from their neighbours that we cannot ignore, and it is not fair on them that these houses should turn into cash cows for opportunist landlords.'

Illegal: Councils want to crack down on rogue landlords turning sheds into illegal and often substandard living accommodation, such as this conversion in nearby Slough

Cut backs: People living in these illegal conversions use council services but do not contribute any council tax towards them - so town halls use thermal imaging to find them

The planning enforcement department of Harrow Council is now investigating 319 suspect properties identified from aerial photos.

Fergus Sheppard, of Harrow Council, added: 'It's a London-wide issue.

'Some of these properties are okay, but in some places people are holed up and it's an exercise to see how many people can fit into one property.

'You can go from the quite nice and well looked after to places which are fairly grim and actually dangerous, with exposed electric wires.

'The people in these buildings often come from abroad and they are at the bottom of a pyramid of exploitation.'

A Bulgarian man who was won the 
National Lottery - twice - has an illegal cabin in the back garden of 
his home that he rents out for as much as £10,000 a year.

George Traykov, 
46, right, a former member of the Bulgarian skydiving team, beat odds of 
one-in-438 million when he picked up a £160,873 EuroMillions prize in 
March to add to the £1million sum he won in the Millionaire Raffle in 
September 2011.

Now a home 
he owns in Harrow, north-west London, has been investigated by council 
staff after the cabin - which has a kitchen, toilet and bedroom - was 
discovered, pictured below.

Speaking at the time of his win, the 
property developer, who has lived in the UK for 20 years,  said: 'I've 
always worked very hard and never spent more than I have so money has 
never been a major problem for me.'

A neighbour, who did not wish to be 
identified, said a lot of people go to and from the property and claimed
 a fence was installed to hide the structure in the garden.

Harrow council served Mr Traykov with two planning enforcement notices.

The
 house itself has been divided into four separate rooms, one of which is
 rented by Polish special educational needs teacher Agnieszka Klojzy, 
who lives in it with her two children, aged five and two.

She
 said: 'George is a good landlord. He looks after us quite well. It was 
scary [when the council came]. I felt like a criminal.'
