A former waitress at Scores Gentleman's Club in New York claims she was fired for she repeatedly turning down her manager’s amorous advances.

Elizabeth Shiflett, 37, has accused her former manager Sammy Roman of repeatedly hugged her and demanded dates and oral sex, according to a lawsuit due to be filed in Manhattan federal court.

Shiflett, now a resident in San Francisco, is demanding $5 million in damages and a court order to prevent Scores from harassing other workers.

She claims she was fired in March 2008 after complaining about Roman harassing her.

Shiflett alleges that on one occasion, he 'straddled me and was asking for oral sex and asking when we were going out. I said, "No! No! No! No!"' she told The New York Post.

Lawyers for the strip joint located in the Manhattan neighborhood of Chelsea have described her law suit as a ‘frivolous’ attempt to get money.

She has already been awarded a US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ruling against her former employer.
