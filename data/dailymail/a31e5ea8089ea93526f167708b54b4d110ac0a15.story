This is the five-year-old boy who was stabbed to death in a 'sickening and violent' attack at his home in Scotland.

Scott Chirashi had suffered a 'significant injury' and could not be saved by emergency services, after they were called to a flat in Alva, Clackmannanshire, on Friday morning.

His mother, Farai Chirashi, 32, was detained by police and is due to appear in court tomorrow in connection with his death. It is understood she is being held under the Mental Health Act.

Scott Chirashi, five, was found stabbed to death at his home in Alva, Clackmannanshire, on Friday morning

Members of the emergency services who attended the scene are believed to have been offered counselling, according to the Daily Record.

One of the medics told the paper the boy had suffered a 'sickening and violent death'. 

The boy's older sister, believed to be named Natasha, was reportedly inside the house at the time of the incident, however, police have denied this claim.

The family, who are originally from Zimbabwe, had lived in the town for years and moved to three years ago, along with Scott's father, Tichakunda Chiriseri.

Tributes were left outside the home of a five-year-old boy who was found dead on Friday morning

The little boy, who has been named locally as Scott Chiriseri, had sustained 'significant injuries' in incident

They were reportedly members of Alva Baptist Church before the couple split 'a few' months ago.

It has since emerged that Mr Chiriseri had joined a controversial religious organisation run by a self-styled prophet shortly before the break-up.

The Stirling-based Agape For All Nations Ministries Internationals church is headed by former academic Dr Joseph Masocha, and describes itself as a 'fast-growing church established in 2007'.

Dr Masocha, a former university lecturer who is also from Zimbabwe, sparked outrage after claiming he is a prophet 'annointed by God'.

Neighbours demanded the council give him an ASBO after claims he was baptising people and carrying out exorcisms in his back garden.

A spokesman for the church confirmed Mr Chiriseri was a member and said they were offering him counselling after his son was found dead.  

He said: 'It's obviously a very difficult time. He had been a member of the church for months and we understand he wasn't at the house because he had separated from his wife.

'I believe they split up a few months ago and she is not a member of our church.'

Forensics teams remained at the scene in Alva, Clackmannanshire, while continuing their investigations

Residents have left floral tributes and teddies outside the flat, including one from Alva South Bowling Club

Residents have been left shocked and devastated by the death of the 'popular' little boy and several turned out to lay tributes at a makeshift shrine beside the flat yesterday.

One mother, who asked not to be named, told the Scottish newspaper: 'Scott was in my son’s class. He was very popular and had a great personality.' 

Chigozie Ononiwu, a Nigerian IT worker who lives nearby, told the paper his son was in the same class as Scott at Alva Primary School.

'I cried when I heard what had happened to Scott. He was a lovely little boy and was due to come over to our house this weekend.'

He added that it had been difficult to explain what had happened to his own son, who is 'very upset'.

A Zimbabwean friend of the child's mother, who she met in 2006 at Stirling University while studying for a general nursing degree, said she was shocked to hear of Scott's death.

She explained that the 32-year-old, who lived in Botswana before moving to Scotland, had been looking after her mother in Harare after the death of her father.

She said: 'I know she loved that boy so much, I can’t believe it.'

William Wood, 30, the family’s former landlord, paid tribute to the dead boy.

He said: ‘They were a lovely family from Zimbabwe, religious, did not drink alcohol of any sort, quiet, good neighbours, no trouble at all – among the best tenants we ever had.

‘Scott used to play with my wee boy who is around the same age – he was just three when we knew him. He was just a lovely, normal three-year-old.

‘We knew the parents as Fari and Titch. They had lived in our property for three years. We are really, really shocked.’

Local councillor Archie Drummond said the death had shaken the local community. He said: 'This has come as a real shock to this tight-knit town.' 

Tributes were left at the scene yesterday including a teddy bear with a message, which read: 'Dear God, Why???'

Another, from the bingo club at  Alva South Bowling Club, said: 'Sleep well little one,' while an array of teddies, flowers and candles were scattered at the front of the house.

At the same time, forensics officers could be seen going in and out of the building and searching the grass outside the flat, apparently looking for the weapon involved.

Emergency services were called to the address at 8.50am on Friday after a member of the public dialled 999.

Chief Inspector, Stephen Sneddon, speaking on Friday said: ‘Emergency services in the Forth Valley responded to an address in Carnaughton Place, Alva, around 8.50am today in response to a call about the welfare of a five-year-old boy. 

'On arrival, police officers found the child with a significant injury to his body. He was later pronounced dead at the scene by the Scottish Ambulance Service.

A woman, believed to be the mother, is being questioned by police after he was found stabbed to death

Police said that they will be carrying out inquiries in the area and asked for the public's continued support

‘Inquiries into the full circumstances surrounding this incident are ongoing and a woman is currently detained in connection with the investigation.

‘We are not currently looking for anyone else and I want to reassure the local community that there is no risk to them.

‘Police officers will be carrying out various inquiries in the area and I would ask the public to continue to give us the full support they have shown so far, to allow us to conclude these investigations as soon as possible and allow the area to return to normal.

‘This is a quiet area and I would emphasise that this is a very unusual incident which poses no risk to others.’ 

Local Susan Smith, 48, said yesterday: ‘I walked past this morning and police officers in their white forensic suits were out scouring the grass in front of the place.’

An onlooker said: ‘Officers have been going in and out all morning, looking grim-faced. People say the woman being held is a young mum. It’s an awful tragedy.’

A spokesman for the Crown Office and Prosecutor Fiscal Service said: 'A 32-year-old woman has been detained in relation to the death but she has not been charged.' 

Police said there was one other child in the household, who was not at home when the incident occurred. Officers refused to say if the mother and dead child were known to social workers. 

When officers arrived at the flat Place at 8.50am, the boy was found with 'significant injuries'
