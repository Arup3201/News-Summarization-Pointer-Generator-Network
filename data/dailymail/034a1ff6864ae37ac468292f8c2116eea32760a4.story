This is the emotional moment a grandfather-of-six finally came face-to-face with his long-lost sister for the first time.

John Haydon, 72, of Bloxwich, West Midlands, was astonished when he received a message out of the blue from a woman from Tennessee claiming to be his sister.

He spent his whole life thinking he was an only child, after the death of his baby brother resulted in his mother Eileen leaving their family home when he was aged just three.

Full of joy: John Haydon, 72, meets Diane Messer, 58, at Birmingham New Street train station for the first time

Giving her a hug: Mr Haydon said he had 'been so nervous all morning' before meeting his long-lost sister

The moment: Mr Haydon, of Bloxwich, West Midlands, meets his long-lost sister Mrs Messer, of Tennessee, for the first time at Birmingham New Street train station on April 12 at 2.30pm

Mr Haydon grew up never knowing what 
happened to his mother, despite his attempts to trace her. But he 
received a message on Facebook from Diane Messer, 58, saying she was his
 sister.

Mr Haydon said: ‘I 
was completely overwhelmed when I received the message online. I had 
friends over at the time and I was completely speechless, which was a 
first.

‘I had to 
read the message over and over again before it finally settled in - I 
had a sister. The realisation at my age can’t be put into words.

‘When
 Diane messaged me she was asking about my mum. I was excited as I 
thought maybe she knew her, but eventually she told me she was her 
daughter. I couldn’t believe it.

‘I
 still can’t get over it all now - I always wondered if my mum had 
settled down again and if I had other family out there but I could never
 find any information about where she had gone.’

Surprise: Mr Haydon he received a message on Facebook from Mrs Messer, saying she was his sister

Family: Mr Haydon spent his whole life thinking he was an only child, 
after the death of his baby brother resulted in his mother Eileen 
(pictured, left and right) leaving their family home when he was aged just three

On a boat: Eileen fled to France and worked as painter, before heading to the Caribbean and later to New York where she became a window dresser for Macy's department store

He has now learned that his mother fled to France and worked as painter, before heading to the Caribbean and later to New York where she became a window dresser for Macy’s department store.

'We pushed everyone out of the way and ran over to each other and had a huge hug. I finally felt like my life was complete'

John Haydon

Eileen eventually settled down with Mrs Messer’s father, a GI from New Orleans in Louisiana, and had a happy life but never spoke of the family she had left behind.

Mrs Messer had already planned her visit to Britain with her husband Doug - to visit her mother’s parents grave and to see where Eileen had grown up - before she even knew about her half-brother.

Last month on April 12, the siblings met for the first time outside a WH Smith store at Birmingham New Street train station. Mr Haydon said: ‘I had been so nervous all morning.

‘Even though we had spoken for over six months online every day I was incredibly anxious. We pushed everyone out of the way and ran over to each other and had a huge hug.

Memories shared: Mr Hayden and Mrs Messer have spent some time looking through photographs together

Connection: Mr Haydon and Mrs Messer speak through the video call app Facetime, send each other family photos of their mother and exchange stories

Happy: Mrs Messer (right) had already planned her visit to Britain before she even knew about Mr Haydon (left)

‘I finally felt like my life was complete. We have such a great relationship and already pull pranks on each other - like when she ordered pizza to my house because she knows I don’t like cheese.

‘I’m now planning my visit to Tennessee to go and visit Di and Doug. I can’t wait - we both finally have the family we always wanted.’

The siblings had been 4,000 miles apart and were only united after Mrs Messer looked into her family tree and contacted Mr Haydon.

Mr Haydon had contacted countless family history websites over the years but struggled to put the pieces of the mystery together after his mother vanished.

Two years ago he began saving for an iPad, in order to be able to make his own Facebook account. Just four weeks after Mr Haydon joined up to the social media site, he was contacted by Mrs Messer.

Greeted: Mr Hayden and Mrs Masser were clearly delighted to meet each other for the first time, in Britain

Research: Mr Haydon (pictured in his twenties) had contacted countless family history websites over the years but struggled to put the pieces of the mystery together after his mother vanished

Link: Mr Haydon discovered that on his mother's death bed, she had asked Mrs Messer to wear her fondest necklace which she named Spike. This was Eileen's nickname for Mr Haydon when he was a little boy

Mrs Messer said: ‘It was fate that John got his iPad when he did. After our mother passed away some years ago when she was 89, I began to look into her family tree.

‘I was unsuccessful for many years but eventually I came across a website and within hours I found out about my mother’s history - her maiden name was Eileen Pinches and she had two sons.

'I discovered one son had died, but then it hit me - I had a brother out there somewhere'

Diane Messer

‘I discovered one son had died, but then it hit me - I had a brother out there somewhere.

‘I wanted to make sure John was my brother before I told him the bombshell that I actually was his half-sister, so we began speaking on Facebook first.

‘When I told him the news there was no response at first and I thought he’d had a heart attack but he finally responded with the words - “love you”.’

Mr Haydon and Mrs Messer have since spoken every day through the video call app Facetime and sent each other family photos of their mother and exchanged stories.

In the stocks: Mr Haydon said the siblings 'have a great relationship and already pull pranks on each other'

Smiles: They had been 4,000 miles apart and were only united after Mrs Messer looked into her family tree

Mr Haydon thought after his mother left she had completely forgotten about him.

However he discovered the heart-rending news that on her death bed, his mother had asked Mrs Messer to always look after and wear her fondest necklace which she named Spike.

Eileen’s nickname for Mr Haydon when he was a little boy was Spike.

Mr Haydon said: ‘It’s great to know she never forgot me and she always had a piece of me with her. Me and Diane have worked together to try and piece together her life.

‘She really was quite the traveller. We’ve lost two or three years - and have no idea where she was or what she did, which will always remain a mystery.'
