Retrial: Meredith Kercher's mother Arline and sister Stephanie, pictured at their Coulsdon home today

The
family of murdered student Meredith Kercher today welcomed the news that Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito would face a 
re-trial.

Meredith's mother Arline and sister Stephanie said 
that they had been told that an Italian court had overturned the 
acquittals this morning.

Knox was originally 
sentenced to 26 years in prison and her former boyfriend Sollecito 25 
years for killing and sexually assaulting Meredith in 2007.

They both served four years before being acquitted on appeal in 2011.

Speaking
outside their home in Coulsdon, south London, the Kerchers said that all they wanted was justice for the 21-year-old woman they knew as Mez.Â 

Stephanie said: 'There are obviously a lot of unanswered 
questions still, so we just hope that the outcome will answer those.

'All that we want is justice for Mez, but there is still a long journey 
ahead of us. But it's making sure that we find out exactly what did 
happen that night.

'Nothing's going to bring her back. We know that, but we have to do what we can for her as well.

'We just follow the system and hope we get complete justice. Every day is difficult, we have our lives, but we're still remembering Mez all together.'

Miss Kercher said that they were speaking to their solicitor to find out how the case would progress.

She added that a trust set up in her sister's name, which is helping to pay 
legal costs in the case, would eventually support people who found 
themselves in a similar situation.

She added: 'We've set up the Meredith Kercher Trust to help with 
Meredith's case, but with the view that I'm going to convert it to a 
charity to help other people once our case is closed. Just people in our
situation really.

'On the back of depending what interest I get with it will determine how I can best help other people.

'But I think one thing that has come out of it for us is we don't 
actually have any financial support from anyone at all, so it is 
literally all paid for by ourselves. I think if there's any way we could
help anyone else in that situation it would help.

'It's about doing something a bit more positive. I think Mez always 
liked to help other people so if I can do something for her then that's 
what I'll do.'

The sisters' mother Arline, who has been ill, said that she, too, welcomed the news.

'I'm glad that someone is looking at it,' she said admitting that she surprised there would be a retrial.

In Italy, the Kercher family's lawyer said that he was very pleased with the result.

Francesco Maresca said: 'I
am happy the Supreme court has seen the faults in the acquittal and I 
trust the next trial will be fair and balanced.'

The ruling by the Court of 
Cassation examined whether there were procedural irregularities which 
gave grounds for a retrial, rather than assessing the details of the 
case, which remain obscure in many particulars.

Kercher was on a year-long exchange program in Perugia when 
she was murdered, bringing a flood of unwelcome attention to the 
medieval town in central Italy that her family said she loved.

Much 
of the attention of the case was focused on the carefree image of 
foreign students enjoying a year abroad in Italy as well as on lurid 
stories of sex and heavy partying.

Prosecutors had said that Kercher 
resisted attempts by Knox, Sollecito and a third man, Ivorian Rudy 
Guede, to involve her in an orgy in the apartment the two women shared 
in the town.

However their case was weakened by forensic experts who 
undermined the credibility of DNA evidence provided by police and made 
strong criticisms of their first response procedures at the scene of the
killing.

Guede, found guilty and sentenced to 16 years in a separate
trial, is now the only person serving time for the murder, although 
prosecutors say he could not have killed Kercher by himself.
