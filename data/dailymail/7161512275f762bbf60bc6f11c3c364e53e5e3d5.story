Arrest: June  when she was arrested for contempt after falling behind in child support

June 'Mama June' Shannon failed to pay more than $4,000 in child support to her own mother when she became the legal guardian of Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell  after the little girl was molested.

Sandra Hale became Anna's guardian  in 2003, a year after the child was allegedly sexually abused by her mother's then-boyfriend Mark McDaniel.

According to TMZ, Mama June, now 35, was required to pay Hale $100 a month in child support, but she quickly fell far behind on the payments.

In 2009, she was arrested and the Henry County District Attorney filed criminal contempt charges, claiming she had fallen $4,144.62 behind on the child support.

June was behind 'due to willful and continuous refusal to comply', legal documents obtained by TMZ stated, and the mother-of-four was threatened with jail time.

But three months after it was filed, the contempt charge was dismissed. 

McDaniel, 53, was released from prison earlier this year after serving 10 years for aggravated child molestation of an eight-year-old in 2004, who Anna says is actually her.

Despite damning photographs that show them house hunting together and him hanging out with her daughter Honey Boo Boo, Mama June previously denied claims that she has been seeing McDaniel.

In an interview with Entertainment Tonight that aired this week, June said she had only seen McDaniel twice since he was released from prison and denied they were in a relationship.

June said one meeting she had with McDaniel was coincidental, and the other was to give closure to her daughter Pumpkin, who had been raised believing McDaniel was her father.

She said 12 other people were in the room when she took Pumpkin to see McDaniel.

After the images emerged, TLC canceled Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, which has run for four seasons. At aged nine, Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' is a year older than her sister Anna was when she says she was abused by McDaniel. 

Anna claimed he sexually abused her for months in 2002 at the trailer he shared with Mama June - sometimes while sister Lauryn 'Pumpkin' Shannon, then three, was forced to watch.

Mama June's mother, who was owed the child support, spoke to Entertainment Tonight last month about the abuse her granddaughter suffered. 

'My reaction was I wanted to kill him,' Hale said of McDaniel. 'To do that to a child - especially her... I took her to the police department and filed the charges. I wasn't going to let this go away.'

She said that she thinks her daughter is 'in denial' about what McDaniel did and that she is now concerned for the safety of Honey Boo Boo, who is nine.

'That's about the same age he likes,' she said.

Hale said that when child protective services called her recently, she urged them to look 'carefully and closely' into the allegations that McDaniel has been hanging around Mama June's children.

After Anna told her teacher and police about the assaults, her mother refused to believe her, she said.

'Mama didn't believe me for a while,' she told HLN. 'She would say, ''Why would you do that to me?' And I would say, 'Mama, he did it, I can't take the past back'.

'He's apologized for what he's done but she won't... I'm hurt now and I was hurt then.'

But Anna added that she is still in touch with her mother and that they are 'working on things'.

Pumpkin, now 14, has repeatedly defended her mother in interviews and on social media.

The children's uncle, Uncle Poodle, has also claimed in an interview that he witnessed the young girl sharing a bed with McDaniel and Mama June during a trip to North Carolina in September.

'I'm disgusted with June for not protecting Alana from Mark,' Uncle Poodle - real name Lee Thompson - told the National Enquirer.

'This guy can't be trusted. He needs to be locked up and have the key thrown away.' 

Mama June's three youngest girls still live at home in MacIntyre, Georgia, while Anna - who has a two-year-old daughter, Kaitlyn - has since moved to Alabama after marrying Michael Cardwell.

June has maintained her four daughters are from four different men.

The claim means convicted child molester Mark Anthony Ford Ford is father two of the girls, middle daughters Jessica and Lauryn 'Pumpkin'.

Eldest Anna's father is David Dunn, who was sentenced for stealing a handgun in 1995 and again in 1998 for stealing cigarettes.

The father of the youngest, Alana 'Honey Boo Boo', is Mike 'Sugar Bear' Thompson, who split from wife Mama June earlier this year.
