Freedom in Hong Kong is being undermined by the Chinese government, British MPs warned yesterday.

Beijing's involvement in Hong Kong's elections is 'unduly restrictive' and freedom of speech, the Press and assembly are being eroded, the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee said in a report.

Chairman Sir Richard Ottaway added that a 'troubling pattern' of reduced freedoms was emerging as Hong Kong's autonomy comes 'under pressure'. 

The parliamentary committee urged the UK government to be more outspoken in support of democracy in Hong Kong, warning that failing to do so could damage Britain's reputation there. 

The committee also accused the British Government of abandoning its 'moral obligation' to support democracy in the former UK colony. 

The report added that Britain 'can and should take a position' on democratic reforms in Hong Kong, a former British colony that returned to Chinese rule in 1997.

Candidates in Hong Kong's first public vote for a leader in 2017 will be vetted by a Beijing committee, meaning voters will not be offered a 'genuine choice', the MPs said.

They argued that Britain's reputation in Hong Kong may be damaged if the Government does not speak up in support of democracy, and urged the UK to take 'an unambiguous position on its expectations for constitutional reform'.

Tens of thousands of people in Hong Kong turned out for pro-democracy protests that rocked the city for 11 weeks last year. The student-led protesters occupied key streets in financial districts to demand the removal of restrictions in place for 2017 elections.

The report also criticized British officials for not summoning the Chinese ambassador after China banned members of the parliamentary committee from visiting Hong Kong in December.

Beijing's decision to treat the visit as interference in China's internal affairs 'raises wider concerns about the state of UK-China relations,' it said.

China said the UK had 'no right to interfere' in the matter.
