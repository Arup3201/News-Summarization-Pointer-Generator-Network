A student designer has used a 3D printer to create an 
intricate prosthetic arm for one of his classmates, taking 45 hours to 
print it out.

Evan Kuester, 23, made the arm for Ivania Castillo as part of a design competition at Savannah College, Georgia.

Kuester decided to make the limb for 21-year-old Ivania, despite never having spoken to her before.

While Ivania, who was born 
without a hand, was initially taken back by the offer, curiosity got the
 better of her and she agreed.

Kuester took pictures of her arm from every angle to fit the design around, then used computer software to apply the fine circular details to the outside of the arm.

He also made part of it hollow, allowing sunlight to pass through or for a light bulb to be placed inside.

He then printed the arm over 45 hours using a 3D printer which cost $200 (£120).

While it has limited practical uses, Kuester says it was designed more as a piece of jewellery than as an everyday prosthetic.

The arm has an interlocking pattern running 
across the surface and a hollow centre allowing light to pass through or
 a light bulb to be placed inside

The arm was designed using computer software and cost £200 to make. Despite not speaking before the project, Kuester and Ivania are now firm friends

Evan said: 'I’ve always wanted to design a prosthetic arm for as long as I can remember so the contest was the push I needed to finally make one.

'I wanted it to be designed to take advantage of the possibilities available to the world of prosthetics.

'This piece was inspired by unique design opportunities only available to a select few.

'With user defined parameters, each design will be inherently different from the next in style, size and need.

'Ivania is one of the first prosthetics to work with the concept of a prosthetics as decoration.'

Ivania, from Miami, Florida, added: 'My initial reaction to the entire conversation was confusion - as Evan and I had never spoken to each another.

The arm was meant to be decorative, but does have limited practical uses such as holding a glass of wine

'I decided to go along with it because I was curious to see what would come out of it and it’s not every day a complete stranger comes up to you and offers to design you a custom prosthetic.

'When Evan told me the arm had finished printing I was beyond excited to see it.

'He promised I’d be the first to see it and when I did I couldn’t believe the intricacy and level of detail it had - I was in awe.

'I immediately tried it on and we were both relieved to find out that it fit me perfectly.'
