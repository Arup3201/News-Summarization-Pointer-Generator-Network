The Home Office has lost track of 174,000 illegal immigrants and is struggling to find them, a report revealed today.

The dossier, which Home Secretary Theresa May has been accused of suppressing, found three-quarters of foreigners refused permission to stay in Britain have vanished.

The scandal of huge numbers of ‘over-stayers’ – migrants who remain in the UK even though their visas have expired – was exposed in a scathing study by the independent immigration watchdog.

Home Secretary Theresa May arrived for a cabinet meeting at 10 Downing Street in London this morning ahead of a damning report by the chief borders inspector John Vine

John Vine, the Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration, highlighted the fiasco as the latest in a string of glaring gaps in border controls.

Mr Vine, who has clashed with Mrs May over the timing of the release of several reports,  revealed that pre-December 2008, about 232,000 foreigners had applications for visa extensions to allow them to live in the UK rejected.

The UK Border Agency – now replaced by the Border Force – should have ensured they left the country, but out of that number, only 58,000 have been tracked down, and either forced to go home or are awaiting deportation. 

It means 174,000 illegal ‘overstayers’ could not be found. 

Mr Vine’s report said that 80 per cent of students who are given visas to study here for four years do not leave after that period elapses. Some 85 per cent of sham marriage grooms are students. 

Officials have also failed to carry out basic checks on more than 200,000 migrants applying for British citizenship every year.

'Stooge wife': Naima Makda with boyfriend Ibrahim Mahter

BY Andy Dolan 

The ringleader of a sham marriage gang used his own girlfriend as a ‘stooge wife’, marrying her to strangers for £8,000.

Ibrahim Mahter, 29, organised a string of lucrative fake ceremonies and ‘pressured’ women to take part.

His girlfriend, Naima Makda, 28, was one of several bogus brides who would marry foreign nationals for £8,000 a time so that they could stay in the UK.

Mahter, along with Abdulgani Makrani, 66, paid the women to marry strangers from Pakistan and India, a court heard.

Both men, along with Makda and two other fake brides were jailed on Monday after a judge said they had shown ‘total disrespect for the institution of marriage and UK immigration laws’. 

Mr Vine’s report – which has sat on Mrs May’s desk for months – heaped fresh humiliation on the beleaguered department.

The Home Secretary will also face questions on why she chose to ‘bury’ the document on the day before MPs’ Christmas recess and at the same time as the Al Sweady report into allegations that British soldiers murdered and tortured Iraqi detainees is published.

Earlier this year, MPs accused Home Office officials who admitted they had no idea where the missing immigrants and failed asylum seekers were of ‘unacceptable complacency’. 

Despite being ordered out of the country, many had ‘gone to ground’ and were working in the so-called black economy, illegally claiming benefits and even voting in elections, the Commons’ public accounts committee found.

MPs said the shambles had worsened and called for ‘urgent steps’ to sort out the ‘mess’.

It is understood there are an additional 3,000 illegal immigrants who need to be removed every week, a figure that does not include foreign offenders or refugees whose request for asylum has been rejected.

Last week, a damning report by Mr Vine revealed Home Office staff had given British passports to tens of thousands of illegal immigrants and foreign criminals, including at least one murderer. The relationship between Mr Vine and Mrs May plunged into the deep freeze last year after a critical report on border security was – in an unprecedented move – censored by the Home Secretary.

Until this year, the watchdog decided when his reports were published. But after six years and 50 reports, often exposing Government failures, Mrs May seized control of the timing. Mr Vine will leave his post later this month – six months early.

Shadow immigration minister David Hanson said: ‘Theresa May has sought to bury reports because they lay bare the total chaos within her own department. They have exposed a murderer granted British citizenship, a growing asylum backlog and 175,000 people here illegally who have disappeared.’

The Home Office said: ‘This Government has ended the system under which the DNA of innocent people was kept indefinitely – but we will never put the public at risk. Police can keep DNA and fingerprints from any EU national who represents a threat to the public.’
