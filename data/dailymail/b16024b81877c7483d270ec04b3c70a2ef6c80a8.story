The campus police officer who shot dead an unarmed straight A-student outside San Antonio says he opened fire because he felt his life was in danger, it has been revealed.

Corporal Chris Carter, who serves on the police force for the University of Incarnate Word, fired multiple shots and killed Robert Cameron Redus, 23, about 2am Friday after a routine traffic stop. 

More than 200 people - including Redus' mother and father - turned out a vigil Sunday to mourn the UIW student and remember his short life.

'We are understandably devastated by 
the death of our dear son Cameron and we ask for your prayers as we deal
with our tragic loss,' his family said in a statement.

'We trust that God is faithful and will see us through this most difficult time.'

Cpl Carter, the officer who killed Redus, pulled the student over not far from campus in Alamo Heights because he was speeding and 'driving erratically,' according to police.

The officer, who has been placed on leave pending the outcome of the shooting investigation, has an 'extensive law enforcement background,' according to the university.

However, part of the background involves jumping from job-to-job on a regular basis, according to employment records obtained by the San Antonio Express-News.

Cpl Carter has had nine jobs at eight different agencies over his eight-year law enforcement career.

He rarely stayed in any job for more than a year and the two years and seven months as a campus officer for UIW was the longest stint in his career.

KVUE-TV reports that Cpl Carter has told investigators he feared for his life. It's not clear what actions the unarmed Redus took to make the officer believe he was in danger of being killed.

When Redus pulled over at an apartment complex off Broadway, police said Redus got out of his truck and allegedly attacked Carter.

A struggle ensued between the officer and Redus before Carter opened fire and fatally shot the student, police said.

Memories: The ceremony included many remembrances from friends in the UIW community. A candlelight vigil was also held on campus at the Lourdes Grotto. Redus' brother and mother can be seen on the right of the picture

Several of Redus' friends spoke to the media Derrick Bryant said he knew Redus most of his life. The two went to high school together at the Baytown Christian Academy.

'He was the most intelligent, artistic, creative and genius mind I have ever come across,' Bryant said, crying.

Kyle Leihsing, a San Antonio native had been friends with Redus for three years.

'He was one of the most level-headed people I've ever met. What I have heard is completely counter-intuitive to what I have known him to be,' he said, referring to accounts of Redus initiating an altercation with the officer who shot him.'

'There's just an outpouring of genuine grief among hundreds, if not thousands, of people in our community because he was so well-liked and loved,' Annie Jones, a friend of Redus, told KENS 5.

'Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the student and officer involved in this incident,' UIW President Dr. Lou Agnese said.

Redus had moved to San Antonio from Baytown for school. He went to Baytown Christian Academy and graduated as co-valedictorian.

His academic success continued at UIW, where he had been named to the Dean's List and was a part-time anchor for the school's student newscast.

'I grieve on behalf of his parents, because I know how devastated they are. He was a sweet, sweet person,' said family friend Annie Jones.

A witness says he heard the sarcastic
final words of a Texas student moments before he was shot dead by a 
college police officer.

Neighbour Mohammad Haidaras told My San Antonio that he heard a tense exchange between Redus and Carter sixty seconds before shots rang out.

He told the website: 'I heard (a man) say, 'Oh, you're gonna shoot me?' like sarcastic almost.'

The 22-year-old claims he heard gunshots less than a minute later and jumped into his closet.

Investigators say an altercation began when Carter tried to pull Redus over for speeding and driving erratically.

Under investigation: The parking lot of Redus' apartment block where he died is cordoned off by police

Lieutenant Cindy Pruitt of the Alamo Heights Police Department told KSAT that the incident occurred about 2am in the parking lot of the Tree House apartments in the 100 block of Grandview Place off Broadway, where Redus was a resident.

Redus, known to friends by his second name Cameron, had spent the evening celebrating the end of semester with classmates.

It is not clear where Carter first tried to pull Redus over, but both vehicles drove north on Broadway until they pulled into the parking lot of the Treehouse Apartments.

Once there, both got out of their cars and some kind of struggle ensued. Pruitt told My San Antonio that Carter radioed for help shortly before Redus was shot.

A witness who lives in the Treehouse Apartments described hearing 'five or six' gunshots, but no verbal warnings.

'I didn't hear him say anything like, "Get down on your hands and knees," you know? I didn't hear him say anything. He just started shooting,' the man told KSAT.

'He emptied the gun on him,' he said. 'Boom, boom, boom.'

Not aggressive: Cameron Redus' friends and family can't understand how someone as gentle and kind as him could have been shot by a police officer

Mohammad Haidarasl lives directly below Redus at the Treehouse Apartments.

He told My San Antonio that he was asleep on his sofa when he heard an exchange between Redus and Carter.

'I heard [a man] say, "Oh, you're gonna shoot me?" like sarcastic almost,' he said.

Less than a minute later, Haidarasl heard four to six gunshots. He only realized the man who had been shot was his upstairs neighbor, whom Haidrasl described as 'the nicest guy.'

Carter has been placed on administrative leave while officers investigate the shooting.

Officers investigating the incident haven't attempted to contact Haidrasl about what he heard, Haidrasl told My San Antonio.

Back in Redus' hometown of Baytown, the promising student's mother, father, brothers and friends are struggling to understand their loss.

'We are understandably devastated by the death of our dear son Cameron and we ask for your prayers as we deal with our tragic loss. We trust that God is faithful and will see us through this most difficult time,' the victim's family said in a statement.

Redus old friends from high school were shocked to hear the news.

'He was so kind. He’s not an aggressive person at all,' friend Sara Davis told KHOU. 'The story doesn’t really make sense to any of us.'

'He was an honor student, dean’s list every semester, incredibly intelligent,' said Annie Jones. 'So, so, so smart. He was our co-valedictorian in high school.'

A vigil has been set for 7pm on Saturday at the University of the Incarnate Word grotto.

According to ABC, Redus' family has hired an attorney.
