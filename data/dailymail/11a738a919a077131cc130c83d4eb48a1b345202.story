Church treasurer Mark Conway-Wilcox (pictured) has admitted four counts of theft after stealing £20,000 from St Wilfrid's Church's renovation pot

A trusted church treasurer who stole £20,000 from a renovation pot to fund his gambling habit has narrowly avoided jail.

Mark Conway-Wilcox, 30, of Newbiggin Hall, Newcastle, admitted four counts of theft after stealing from St Wilfrid's Church's - but claimed the amount he had taken was closer to £15,000.

Yesterday he was branded 'unchristian' for leaving the Newcastle church on the brink of closure after stealing the money and blowing it on gambling.

Newcastle Crown Court heard Conway-Wilcox also failed to pay various bills, had creditors chasing the church and even left it potentially uninsured.

The court heard Conway-Wilcox became treasurer at St Wilfrid's in May 2013 and was responsible for making sure money was put in the bank and invoices were paid.

After receiving complaints about unpaid bills Reverend Sarah Miller initially gave Conway-Wilcox the benefit of the doubt.

But matters came to a head in May last year when Ecclesiastical Insurance rang up and told her they had not been paid and that the church and its contents were potentially uninsured.

An investigation began and it was discovered Conway-Wilcox had transferred £10,098 from the church's refurbishment account into his own between November 2013 and May 2014.

A further £550 had been moved from church bank accounts to his account and Conway-Wilcox failed to bank more than £10,000 in cheques.

Prosecutor Kevin Wardlaw told the court the total amount misappropriated was £20,856.78.

The church has since been paid back £10,000 by the insurance company.

Paul Caulfield, defending, told the court: 'He had a horrendous gambling problem, referred himself for help and has attended 20 sessions.

'Since this matter came to light he has not been involved in gambling.

'He is mortified by his conduct and apologises publicly, having apologised privately previously.'

Recorder Nicholas Lumley QC told Conway-Wilcox: 'This church serves one of this great city's less fortunate areas and it has a small but committed congregation.

'The church, its fabric and its good work was placed in jeopardy by you.

'And why? Well, because of your greed. You saw them as a soft target and a ready source of cash for your own frailties and you plundered what money they had.

'You took advantage of your position of trust by stealing from various bank accounts and when it was queried you stalled, prevaricated and lied.

'Not only is it unchristian it is thoroughly dishonest.'

Martin Sheppard, of the Diocese of Newcastle, said: 'It's been a very sad story for Martin, for his family and the church family at Newbiggin Hall. It's been a very difficult time for the congregation.

'We don't understand why he did what he did. Everyone feels great sorrow and regret.

'As I understand it, the money that was taken was money that people had been collecting for the renovation work for a church hall facility in the Newbiggin Hall area.

'The money was collected by faithful members of the church and now they have been set back in their project to serve the community where they live,work and worship.'

Conway-Wilcox was handed an eight month prison sentence, suspended for two years, with 200 hours of unpaid work. He was also ordered to pay £5,000 compensation to St Wilfrid's.
