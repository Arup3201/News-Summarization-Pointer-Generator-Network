 

Distraught parents have made a emotional plea for their five year old boy to come home after he was swept out to sea by a freak wake.

A major search to find missing, Jack Dixon, is underway after the little boy disappeared into the water on Shelly beach at Mount Maunganui in New Zealand around noon on Wednesday.

The young boy was playing with family when a large wave dragged him into the surf along with two of his cousins. 

The two sisters scrambled on to rocks and were dragged ashore by two relatives but Jack, who could not swim, disappeared into the water.

Inspector Karl Wright-St Clair from New Zealand police said they would continue to search for the boy until dark fell.

'50 search crews and rescue volunteers, plus a number of surf life saving volunteers are wading through rock pools,' he said.

'It's(the search) been going on for 30 hours, crews are tired but highly motivated to bring him home.'

'We are basically searching to bring Jack home to his family as apposed to a rescue operation.'

'Its mostly been professional volunteers and land search and rescue and surf life saving, these people are all volunteers.' 

The inspector said, on Wednesday when the boy went missing, there was a three to four easterly swell running straight into Shelly beach.

He described the beach as normally very safe, used by many families and young children all year round.

'He was caught by a freak wave,' said inspector Wright-St Clair.

Jack's parents Wayne Dixon and Karen Spargo released a statement through the police thanking all those who have helped. 

'We are shocked, upset, and lost at what has happened.'

'We want to thank Police, lifeguards, and everyone who has done so much for us. We know there is so much community support, and we're truly touched.'

'Jack will be missed by everyone who knew him. We just want him to come home.'

Inspector Wright-St Clair said the family have been struggling to come to terms with what's happened.

'They're extremely distraught, they are slowing coming to realisation that the situation is grave and now just want him home,' he said.

'We're keeping them informed all step of the way, they haven't left here since being informed, so we're keeping them up to date.'

An overnight search is set to be abandoned and will resume first thing in the morning when there is another low tide.

'There's very little value in searching at night under conditions like this,' he said.

'It's tough on searchers they are just highly motivated and just want to bring him back.'

Initially search helicopter patrolled the beach as well as the coastguard. The police native dive team joined in Thursday morning in a shoreline search but visibility restricted them to complete their mission.

'There's hope over the next few days, there will be a window of opportunity for the dive team to return and complete.'

Police say they will re-assess the situation every day as the search goes on. 

Besides the countless volunteers helping with the search for the five year old, there's been a huge outpouring of support from the community.

'It has been humbling to see, food and cards and messages of support for SLS and also huge amount of media and support.'

The inspector says the the family are local but not members of the surf life saving club and came to the beach on school holidays.

'It's a popular holiday destination, hundreds of people on the beach , particualrly beautiful part of the country,' he said.

A Givealittle page has been setup for Jack and hopes to raise funds to assist the family with the costs associated with the search and for the many tough days ahead of them.

So far more than $2,800 NZ has been raised with the goal of getting to $5000.
