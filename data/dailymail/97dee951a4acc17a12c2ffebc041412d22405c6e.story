Panama has detained a North Korean-flagged ship after it was found to be carrying undeclared weapons hidden underneath sugar containers, the country's president said.

President Ricardo Martinelli said the ship, the Chong Chon Gang, was intercepted as it approached the Panama Canal from Cuba and as it was stopped the 35-man crew rioted and the captain tried to kill himself.

The 'sophisticated missile equipment', hidden in containers of brown sugar, was detected after Panamanian authorities stopped the ship, suspecting it was carrying drugs.

Martinelli said the undeclared military cargo appeared to include missiles and non-conventional arms and the ship was violating United Nations resolutions against arms trafficking.

Panama's president Ricardo Martinelli announced the ship had been detained through Twitter

Panamanian authorities have only 
searched one of the ship's five cargo holds so far, said Luis Eduardo 
Camacho, a spokesman for the president.

'This material not being declared and Panama being a neutral country, a 
country in peace, that doesn't like war, we feel very worried about this
 war material and we don't know what else will have... passed through 
the Panama Canal,' Martinelli said.

The governments of North Korea and Cuba have so far not commented on Martinelli's remarks.

Hugh Griffiths, an arms trafficking expert at the Stockholm 
International Peace Research Institute, said the seized ship is called 
Chong Chon Gang and has been on the institute's suspect list for some 
time.

He said the ship had been caught before for trafficking narcotics and 
small arms ammunition. It was stopped in 2010 in the Ukraine and was 
attacked by pirates 400 miles off the coast of Somalia in 2009.

Griffiths' institute has also been interested in the ship because of a 
stop it made in 2009 in Tartus - a Syrian port city hosting a Russian 
naval base.

The vessel was pulled over near the port of Manzanillo on the Atlantic side of the canal.

'We're going to keep unloading the 
ship and figure out exactly what was inside,' Martinelli told Panamanian
 television late on Monday, without giving further details.

'The world needs to sit up and take note: You cannot go around shipping undeclared weapons of war through the Panama Canal.'

Griffiths also said the institute earlier this year reported to the U.N.
 a discovery it made of a flight from Cuba to North Korea that travelled
 via central Africa.

'Given the history of North Korea, 
Cuban military cooperation and now 
this latest seizure, we find this flight more interesting,' he said. 
'After this incident there should be renewed focus on North Korean-Cuban
 links.'

Martinelli said the captain had a heart attack and also tried to commit suicide during the operation. 
He said authorities had been tipped off some days ago that the ship might be carrying drugs.

Undercover? The bags were labeled Cuban Raw Sugar

He posted a picture of what appeared to be a green tubular object sitting inside a cargo container or the ship's hold.

A spokeswoman for the canal said she did not have any more information and referred questions to the attorney general and the office did not immediately return requests for comment.

Javier Caraballo, Panama's top anti-drugs prosecutor, told local television the ship was en route to North Korea.

The Communist country is barred from importing large weapons under United Nations sanctions.

The UN strengthened sanctions against the country in March following it nuclear tests that set tensions rising in the area.

About 15,000 ships pass through the canal every year.
