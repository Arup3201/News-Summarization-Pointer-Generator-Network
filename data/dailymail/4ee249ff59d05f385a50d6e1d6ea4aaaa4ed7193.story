Jailed: Man City youth team player Courtney Meppen Walter wept in court as he was jailed for 16 months for killing a brother and sister while speeding in his Mercedes

New measures to ban newly-qualified drivers from carrying other young people are being considered by ministers in a bid to improve road safety, ministers said today.

Transport spokesman Earl Attlee said ministers were also looking at forcing young drivers to display ‘probationary plates’ showing they had recently passed their test.

His comments over what has been dubbed a ‘graduated driving licence’ firm up ideas floated in November by Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin and have the support of the insurance industry.

They came at question time in the House of Lords after Tory Baroness Gardner of Parkes raised the case of Manchester City footballer Courtney Meppen-Walter, who was jailed for 16 months after killing two adults and injuring two teenagers in central Manchester.

The 18-year-old had been travelling at up to twice the 30mph speed limit in his Mercedes and admitted causing death by dangerous driving.

Lady Gardner said: ‘He had been noted as playing games with a VW Golf before the accident occurred. He is disqualified now for three years.’

She said changes to improve the safety of newly-qualified drivers had been ‘resisted by too many governments’ and it was ‘time something was done’.

Lord Attlee said it was an ‘extreme case but sadly it was not unique’.

He said young drivers were prone to 'immaturity and reckless driving'.

‘They can also be easily distracted particularly when driving carrying others,' he said.

‘We are seeking to improve the risk of these very sad accidents and we will continue on the work of the previous government in doing so.’

Independent crossbench peer Baroness Masham of Ilton said the Government should consider ‘probationary plates on young drivers until they are about 21’.

Lord Attlee said: ‘Probationary plates are one of the things we are considering, possibly linked with other measures such as not allowing young and new drivers to carry young passengers in order to deal with that sort of problem.’

Independent crossbencher the Countess of Mar questioned how it was possible to legislate for the ‘exuberance of youth’.

‘Even if they have a green plate on the back of their car they are going to test the boundaries of law as hard as they can,’ she said.

‘I'm not advocating that they should break the law but we must face facts. We have all been young once and done foolish things.’

But Lord Attlee told her: ‘Experience in Sweden shows that a longer driving supervision can reduce the risk of accidents later on and that is one of the things we are looking at.’

The announcement comes after Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin raised the prospect in November of  banning  young drivers in England and Wales from carrying anyone except family members as passengers.

It was one of a range of ideas he was looking at  to road deaths involving newly-qualified motorists.

The Transport Department said the introduction of P-Plates’ for probationers was one of the options they were looking at.

Roads Minister Stephen Hammond said: 
‘We want to improve the safety of young drivers - that is why we have 
made the driving test more realistic by introducing an independent 
driving element and have stopped publishing test routes to stop 
candidates learning them by rote.

‘As part of the ongoing work to reduce
the risks of accidents involving young drivers, we are considering 
several options to ensure that newly qualified drivers are properly 
prepared and drive safely.

Motorists caught driving while using their mobile phones have blamed 'ranting' ex-wives, over-zealous bosses and even childbirth for their offending behaviour, according to police.

One driver also admitted failing to see a red light because he was on the phone and another denied making a call saying he was only using the internet.

Surrey Police and Surrey County Council have released details of the excuses given by drivers as part of a campaign targeting the use of mobile phones while behind the wheel.

In one case, the driver stopped by police pleaded for help from the officer and said: 'It was my ex-wife harassing me, can you speak to her?'

Another motorist blamed work pressures when he said: 'My boss called to see where I was.'

A father-to-be explained: 'I answered the phone because my wife is having a baby and I thought she may have gone into labour.'

The lure of a smart phone proved too tempting for one motorist, who said: 'I'm not on the phone, I am looking something up on the internet'.

While another pleaded: 'I wasn't calling anyone, I was replying to an email.'Another driver admitted: 'I am always using it. It's about time I got caught.'

Kay Hammond, Surrey County Council's cabinet member for community safety, said: 'It may be tempting to answer a call or check your Facebook while driving, but it is a huge distraction and the consequences can be devastating.

'You are four times more likely to crash if you use a mobile phone while driving.

'Your reaction times are 50% slower and you are more likely to drift across lanes.'

‘We will continue to work with young 
people, the insurance industry, and other key partners in considering 
any changes affecting learner drivers and those who have just passed 
their test.’

Insurers also back such measures believing peer pressure on young drivers can lead them to take risks.

The
Association of British Insurers says drivers aged 17-24 are responsible
for a disproportionately high number of crashes, deaths and claims and 
that an 18-year-old is more than three times as likely as a 48-year-old 
to be involved in a crash.

A third of drivers killed in car accidents are under 25, despite under 25s forming  only one in eight of all car drivers.

Mr McLouglin said at the time: ‘When I talk to young people who have recently passed their test, what they say sometimes is that peer pressure is put on them to go fast, to show off.

‘There is a suggestion as to whether you should look at a restriction whether anyone could carry passengers for six or nine months when they have first passed their test.

‘There are suggestions about them only perhaps being allowed to take a family member to drive a car when you are learning, you have to have a qualified driver in the car. So these are all sorts of areas that I think we can look at.’

The Association of British Insurers has  called for an  overhaul in the system - suggesting people should spend a year learning to drive and urging the introduction of a graduated licence for the first six months after passing a test.

ABI spokesman Malcolm Tarling  said: ‘Other countries have adopted these measures and their experience has shown that they're largely self-policing.

‘Of course there will always be people who will look to avoid the law, but the reality is if you impose something like this, and encourage people to follow it, international experience has shown that that is exactly what people do.’
