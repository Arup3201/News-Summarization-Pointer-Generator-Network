A frozen world, similar to Earth, that is circling just one of a pair of stars could improve the chances of finding alien life.

The new planet, located 3,000 light years away, is twice as massive as Earth and almost exactly the same distance from its parent star as the Earth is from the sun.

Until the discovery, no one realised that rocky planets could form stable orbits round one member of a binary star system. Planets orbiting pairs of binary stars are relatively common.

'This greatly expands the potential locations to discover habitable planets in the future,’ said Professor Scott Gaudi, from Ohio State University.

'Half the stars in the galaxy are in binary systems. We had no idea if Earth-like planets in Earth-like orbits could even form in these systems.'

Named OGLE-2013-BLG-0341LBb, the planet’s host star shines 400 times less brightly than the sun.

It has been described as the real-life version of ice planet Hoth featured in Star Wars sequel The Empire Strikes Back orbits, and is almost certainly a lifeless world. 

But the astronomers point out that the same planet orbiting a sun-like star would be in the 'habitable zone' where conditions are potentially suitable for liquid surface water and life.

Professor Gould led four international teams reporting on the discovery in the journal Science.

The planet was found by chance when scientists spotted an unusual signal in light from a 'microlensing event'.

Two 'Goldilocks' planets thought to lie in the habitable zone of a Gliese 581, a dwarf star just 20 light years from the sun, have turned out not to exist.

Researchers found that light signals that seemed to be from the planets were actually created by events in the star itself.

A star’s habitable orbital region is known as the 'Goldilocks' zone because conditions there are not too hot or too cold but 'just right' to support life.

Astronomers announcing the news in the journal Science were not disheartened, however.

'This result is exciting because it explains, for the first time, all the previous and somewhat conflicting observations of the intriguing dwarf star Gliese 581,' said Dr Paul Robertson, from Pennsylvania State University in the US.

Gliese 581 has three other confirmed planets, none of which lie within its habitable zone. 

This occurs when a star’s gravity acts like a lens, bending light from a much more distant object precisely behind it.

In this case, the binary system containing the new planet disturbed light from a much more distant star 20,000 light years away in the constellation Sagittarius.

The planet caused a 'dip' and distortion in the light signal which after computer analysis provided information about its mass, distance from the star, and orientation.

Data from a network of telescopes in Chile, New Zealand, Israel and Australia, were used to confirm the findings.

'In gravitational microlensing we don’t even look at the light from the star-planet system,' said Professor Gould.

'We just observe how its gravity affects light from a more distant, unrelated star. This gives us a new tool to search for planets in binary star systems.'

The second star in the binary system is also very dim. The two are only as far apart as the distance between Saturn and the sun.

Computer analysis by Professor Cheongho Han at Chungbuk National University, Korea, suggests the planet is -210°C (- 352°F).

Binary star systems composed of dim stars like these are the most common type in the Milky Way.

So the discovery suggests there may be many more terrestrial planets out there, some possibly warmer, and even harbouring life.

Professor Gould added: 'Normally, once we see we have a binary, we stop observing.

'The only reason we took such intensive observations of this binary is we already knew there was a planet. In the future we will change our strategy.'
