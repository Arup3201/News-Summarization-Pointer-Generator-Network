Millions of customers are expected to switch their energy providers after British Gas and npower both announced inflation-busting price rises.

The two firms face an exodus after unveiling charges that mean consumers would be as much as £200 a year better off if they moved.

British Gas, which supplies energy to 8.5million households, is increasing its tariffs by 6 per cent – around £80 a year. The announcement was followed hours later by npower, which said gas would go up by 8.8 per cent and electricity by 9.1 per cent – adding around £103 to the annual bill.

Both firms blamed the Government’s green policies as well as rising wholesale prices for the increases.

But Chancellor George Osborne last night urged energy companies to rethink their price rises. He said: ‘I’m concerned when I see electricity bills going up. We’ve got to do everything we can in Britain to try and keep those bills down.

‘I would urge those energy companies to look again at any increases to see if they are absolutely necessary at a time like this.’ 

The latest increases will take the average yearly bill for a British Gas customer paying by monthly direct debit to £1,265, while the figure for those at npower goes up to £1,252. Npower customers who pay by cash or cheque will pay £1,357, which is an increase of £112.

The rises will kick in next month when customers feeling the winter chill are particularly vulnerable.

The two announcements, coming within hours of each other, fuelled claims that the energy giants are working as a loose cartel, raising prices at the same time to the same level.

Consumer groups said the rises represented a ‘Black Friday’ for families and would be a disaster for vulnerable groups who face a choice between heating and eating.

They urged customers to fight back by switching to small suppliers or to a fixed price deal. Energy supplies are dominated by six major companies – British Gas, SSE, npower, E.ON, EDF and Scottish Power.

SSE is putting up its prices by 9 per cent from Monday, while British Gas tariffs will rise on November 16 and those at npower on November 26.

Audrey Gallacher, of the official customer body, Consumer Focus, said the public would be suspicious about the rise in bills.

‘Two price hikes on the same day will 
just reinforce the views and prejudices of consumers – whether justified
 or not – about a lack of transparency and competitiveness in the 
market,’ she said.

Switching energy suppliers is easy, yet 60 per cent of households have never moved.

Many have developed a loyalty to their supplier and have viewed the whole switching process as complex or risky.

However, this loyalty is often repaid with higher charges – while firms focus their attention on launching cheaper deals to attract new customers.

The simplest way to cut a bill is to stop paying by cash or cheque and change to monthly direct debit. This can save £80 a year.

Big savings come from switching to internet-based accounts. Customers provide their own meter readings, paper bills are replaced by email alerts and payments are made by direct debit.

There is a raft of price comparison and switching services on the internet, including Which?, uSwitch, and MoneySupermarket, which make switching as straightforward as possible.

‘Our research shows over six million households in England already plan to cut back on their heating this winter because they are worried about affording their bills.’ 

Consumer Focus encouraged customers to switch away from the high tariffs, saying: ‘We would encourage consumers to do what they can to cut their bills by switching tariff, payment method and supplier.’ 

Currently, the cheapest option comes from First Utility, which operates an internet-based energy account charging an average of £1,054 a year. 

Profits at British Gas were up by 23 per cent in the first half of 2012 to £345million, which contributed to a 15 per cent rise at parent company Centrica, which made £1.45billion.

British Gas Managing Director, Phil Bentley, insisted the price rises were necessary. ‘We simply cannot ignore the rising costs that are largely outside our control, but which make up most of the bill,’ he said. 

‘Britain’s North Sea gas supplies are running out, and British Gas has to pay the going rate for gas in a competitive global marketplace.  The investment needed to maintain and upgrade the national grid to deliver energy to our customers’ homes, and the costs of the Government’s policies for a clean, energy efficient Britain are all going up.’ 

Mr Osborne acknowledged that the energy companies need to invest in infrastructure but said they should not use that as an excuse to ramp up prices. 

‘I think energy companies should make sure they’re only adding to their bills the absolute minimum they need to add to continue investing in our energy supply and they’re not going beyond that,’ he said.

ENERGY giant npower has blamed the Government’s green taxes for its increased fuel bills.The company said the rush to cut carbon emissions was a major factor in it driving up charges by 9 per cent.

Huge costs are involved in subsidising wind farms and building a new network of cables and pylons to connect them to the national grid.

An average of £4billion will be taken from consumer bills from next year to support the shift to green and nuclear energy.

From yesterday's Mail

Regulations from Brussels and 
Westminster mean energy firms face penalty charges if they create 
electricity from coal, oil or gas.

The companies then pass this charge on to consumers. Separately, levies have been built into bills to raise money to fund so-called ‘free’ insulation for customers.

Npower’s chief commercial officer, Paul Massara, said: ‘There is never a good time to increase energy bills, particularly when so many are working hard to make ends meet.

‘But the costs of new statutory schemes, increases in distribution charges and the price of gas for the coming winter are all being driven up by external factors, for example government policy.’ 

He added: ‘We support moves to reduce CO2 emissions but new government schemes will mean that energy bills will rise.’
