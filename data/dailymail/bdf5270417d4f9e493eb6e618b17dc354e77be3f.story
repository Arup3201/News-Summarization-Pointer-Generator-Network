Out of favour: Southampton stiker Lee Barnard spent time on loan at Oldham Athletic last season

A Premier League footballer told his tenants they would have their gas and electricity cut off if they did not leave his property within two weeks.

Southampton forward Lee Barnard, 28, and his fiancee Tonya French who he is due to marry today, bought the 14-bedroom townhouse in Chelmsford, Essex recently.

Barnard, the landlord, wrote to the 11 residents telling them to get out because he wants to renovate the property.

The former Tottenham player offered a £100 'incentive' to the 
tenants - including vulnerable people as well as those on housing and 
disability benefits - to move out quickly.

The tenants, who have individual flats in the large detached house, should legaly have been given two months to quit.

Sandra
Keeble, who has been living in the property for five years, said: 'We 
are being completely bullied. I think it is abhorrent and horrible.

'We were told to get out with our belongings but there was no chance of us finding the money within two weeks.

'Nobody
has a way to contact the new owner - we tried the number at the bottom 
of the letters but it goes straight to voicemail and no-one replies to 
the e-mails we have sent.'

A charity which helps people who have been made homeless has been helping the families look for new accommodation.

Ray Ellis, 52, is on disability benefits and was shocked by the demand to leave so suddenly.

He said: 'I have asked for more time to find somewhere else to go - we are not finding it easy to find an alternative.'

Three of the residents have moved out since the demands were made last month.

Officials from Chelmsford Borough Council have told the residents they are legally allowed to stay.

Barnard blamed the situation on a 'mix up' and said he had been cooperative throughout.

'We wrote to the tenants when we found out that the notice period was not long enough,' he said last night.

'We were happy to extent the notice period and have been in regular contact with the council as well.

'I
have not been trying to bully the tenants - I bought the property, I 
think it is quite run-down and needs a lot of work and I am within my 
rights to serve the notice period and that is now a sufficient one.

'It's
just a misunderstanding with the handover from the previous owner who 
said we only had to give them notice of a day, so with the rent-free 
period and £100 we felt it was a good offer.

'The
council are fully aware of the situation and are happy with the 
arrangements - the first letters were just sent out with the wrong 
date.'

A Chelmsford City Council spokesman said: 'I confirm tenants did contact us and they were advised they have been served an illegal notice and that they don't have to leave by June 1.

'We informed them of their rights and offered our help and support in finding new housing when the tenancy ends.

'The new owner has been advised of their legal obligations and the new owners have been completely compliant and are now following the correct legal process.'
