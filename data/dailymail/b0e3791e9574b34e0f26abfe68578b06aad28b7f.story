‘It’s located just 90 kilometres outside of Sydney – It offers the perfect getaway or a retreat lifestyle for anyone with multiple families,’ Eason said.

‘Where the property sits on, offers quite a view. It’s more than just a music studio and it’s also ideally suited to running cattle, paddock or other livestock.

'What makes it stand out and so different to other homes is its' unique architectural design. The natural material used in the structure and the timber and metal work is absolutely stunning.

‘It’s also the perfect home for anyone in the entertainment industry –a composer or a musician who wants their own secluded location – this would be ideal.’

Sprawled across more than 40 hectares of land with fencing and cattle yards, the property offers a prime location with serene surroundings

The beautifully architectural home features a music studio, meditation room, a fireplace, and a secret bookcase leading to a spa upstairs

The handcrafted property comes complete with four generous sized bedrooms and three bathrooms - perfect for a large family

Enhanced by soaring ceilings, the property’s homestead has been lovingly renowned to form the main residence, from which the new home owners can soak up from the spa after a long day and relax on the balcony.

With a secret door behind a bookcase that leads to a bathroom upstairs, the home boosts an array of four ‘generous’ sized bedrooms, three bathrooms, an enormous entertainment/music studio, an open fireplace, a meditation room as well as beautiful garden surrounds. 

Sprawled across 122 hectare of pastoral land with fencing and cattle yards, the property’s original homestead has been lovingly renovated and owned by Australian businesswoman Katharine Farnsworth and her American husband.

‘One of the amazing parts about living here is you actually see the weather rolling in with the wonderful ever-changing mists and clouds that rise in various forms out of the valley after a storm,’ Mrs. Farnsworth told The Wall Street Journal.

Farnsworth said she is selling the property because her husband has passed away for quite some years and thought it would be the perfect time for a change.

‘Everything has been valued, so if people would like to purchase 90% of the contents in the house and studio, then there is a 10% discount,' she told The Wall Street Journal.
