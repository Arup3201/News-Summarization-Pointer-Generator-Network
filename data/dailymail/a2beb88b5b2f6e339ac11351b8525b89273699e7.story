An Indianapolis police officer has broken into his ex-wife's home and shot her dead before turning the gun on himself, police say.

Sergent Ryan Anders broke down the back door of ex Kim Carmack's home at around 5.40pm on Indianapolis' west side, before neighbours reported hearing gunshots.

SWAT teams arrived at the scene to find the bodies inside the house, according to Indianapolis police chief Rick Hite.

Police Chief Richard Hite says Ryan Anders shot ex-wife Kim Carmack after breaking into her home in Indianapolis. Carmack took out a restraining order again Anders after the couple separated

He said that officers had been worried about the couple after Ms Carmack, a 20-year veteran of the force, filed for a restraining order against Anders.

According to neighbours, the couple filed for divorce in April 2013 and a divorce decree was issued in October.

Anders, a narcotics officer who had been with the police for nine years, was suspended over the allegations and forced to hand over his service weapon.

Hite confirmed that Anders had been under electronic surveillance but had managed to dupe officers before cutting the home security system at Ms Carmack's house, breaking in the back door, and shooting her.

According to the New York Daily News, Mayor Greg Ballard said: 'Itâ€™s a very difficult day in the city of Indianapolis. We have lost two of our own. This one hurts deeply. This one hurts very deeply.'

The 
Fraternal Order of Police has opened their headquarters Thursday night 
to officers in need of assistance. Counselors and chaplains are 
available to assist those in need.

Speaking to WTHR, FOP president Bill Owensby said: 'We're
 talking about two law enforcement families, as well as all of their 
co-workers'

'It is just like an 
explosion, the amount of people this is going to affect.'

'She
 was a civilian before she became a sworn police officer and just one of
 the calmest, soft-spoken, nicest people that you'd met. Always 
smiling.'

Both Ms Carmack and Anders were integral members of the 1,500-person police force. Anders was the son of a retired city police officer, while Ms Carmack has a son in the force, reports the Houston Chronicle.

Chief Rick Hite added: 'We had concerns about both of them. They were counseled. They were given directions, and we also were made aware of his (Anders') whereabouts.'
