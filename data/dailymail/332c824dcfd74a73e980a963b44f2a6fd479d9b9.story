A Jewish woman saved nearly 70 years ago from a Nazi concentration camp has finally met the man that set her free.

Marsha Kreuzman, 90, and living in New Jersey, never forgot the US Army liberated her in 1945 from Mauthausen, in Austria, and two months ago found one of her liberators by chance – an anniversary notice.

The notice published in the Newark Star-Ledger celebrated Joe and Anne Barbellas 65th wedding anniversary – Joe Barbella’s unit, the 11th Armored Division liberated Mauthausen.

She called the family in tears telling of her ordeal and gratitude, and the rest was history.

‘From the first day I was liberated, I wanted to thank them, but I didn’t know who to thank,’ she told the Star Ledger during a recent interview.

Ms Kreuzman weighed only 68 pounds when an American soldier picked her up and carried her to safety, she recalled – by that point her mother, father and brother had already died or been killed.

She ended up in Mauthausen after her family was taken from a Jewish ghetto in Krakow, Poland.

The innocent girl felt as if death was calling, that she had no hope. Guards beat her with a wet horse’s whip for not finishing a road – the scars are still visible.

She was hung upside down on a door for hours once for trying to visit her brother.

Her father was executed along with dozens of others while she was forced to watch. 

Her brother was then sent to the notorious Auschwitz concentration camp where German SS killed him in January, 1945.

She was shuttled among a few camps before ending up a broken girl with all hope lost at Muathausen.

By the time Joe Barbarella and his unit arrived in May, the prisoners were in dire straits.

‘When we got there, we saw all these people were skin and bones,’ he told the paper.

A soldier walked up to Ms Kreuzman, picked her up and said ‘you’re free.’

She searched for that soldier for 68 years.

‘I always look for liberators,’ she told the paper. ‘I wasn’t giving up.’

As it is today:  Stones of remembrance are pictured earlier this year on the main square of former concentration camp Mauthausen

The Barbarella’s wedding announcement brought everything full-circle.

‘A veteran of World War II, Joseph served in the 11th Armored Division which liberated the Mauthausen concentration camp,’ said the announcement.

Ms Kreuzman called the Barbarellas the next day, a meeting was arranged for later that month.

She quickly praised Joe Barbarella as a hero, but he deferred, telling the paper ‘I’m just an ordinary solider.’

They have become good friends, she even brought him a Christmas present because ‘he deserves to be honoured.’
