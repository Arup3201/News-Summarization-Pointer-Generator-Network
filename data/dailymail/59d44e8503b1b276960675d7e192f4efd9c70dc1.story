Vanished: Peter Chadwick missed court on Wednesday and cannot be found by police

A millionaire Southern California real estate executive charged with murdering his wife has vanished two years after posting $1million bail. 

Peter Chadwick failed to report to a court hearing in Orange County on Wednesday - his first missed appointment since he was released on bail in December 2012. 

The 50-year-old father-of-three is accused of strangling his wife Quee 'QC' Chadwick to death at their $2.5million Newport Beach mansion and then dumping her body in a trash bin in San Diego County in October 2012. 

He claims his wife was killed by an unknown assailant and that he was forced by her killer to drive her body to the US-Mexico border.

KTLA-TV reports that Chadwick had made every previous court appearance since being released on bail. 

When he didn't show on Wednesday, an Orange County judge issued a warrant for his arrest. 

'We’re not sure where he is and he really should turn himself in,' Susan Kang Schroeder told KTLA.

Chadwick's lawyer declined to comment on when he last heard from his client.

Chadwick faced up to 25 years in prison if convicted of murder. 

The search for Quee Chadwick began after neighbors called police when she didn't pick up her children from school.

Detectives found blood and a sign of a struggle when they entered the couple's mansion. 

Peter Chadwick was arrested near the US-Mexico border after allegedly dumping his wife's body.
