Four drunk holidaymakers were chased by police for 30 minutes after they stripped off and ran around Dubrovnik naked.

More than 30 officers at one point were running around the Croatian city as they searched for the German tourists.

The bizarre chase started when the men stripped off to go skinny dipping in a fountain during the city's sweltering summer heatwave.

But they abandoned their clothes and sprinted naked around the city centre after an astonished police patrol ran into them by chance.

Goggle-eyed tourists in the city's main Stradun street saw them weaving in and out of shops and tables as they tried to avoid arrest.

One man told a local TV station: ‘It was like something from a film.

‘The four of them were completely nude and they didn't leave anything to the imagination.

‘We were in the city to see the sights, but this isn't quite what we had in mind.’

The visitors were eventually run to ground after trying to hide out in a synagogue.

A police spokesman said: ‘Our biggest problem was how to get them decent for the trip to the police station.

‘They had lost all their own clothes so we borrowed some blankets and some officers lent them bits of kit.’

The four German nationals were held overnight and released the next day, said prosecutors.

Not all of those who witnessed the performance were critical.

One local who saw the chase said: ‘Better four exhibitionists than thousands of boring tourists quietly chewing their pizza.’
