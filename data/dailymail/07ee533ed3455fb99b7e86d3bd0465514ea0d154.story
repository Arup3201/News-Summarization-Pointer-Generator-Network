The Moldovan tour guide who had an affair with the captain of the doomed Costa Concordia has revealed the pair met for 2am sex sessions in his cabin.

Domnica Cemortan, 26, said she was also on the bridge with Francesco Schettino when it crashed into a reef, killing 32 people.

The mother-of-one, who worked as a guide and translator for Russian tourists, said she loved Schettino and was 'fascinated' by him.

Domnica Cemortan has revealed she and her former lover Francessco Schettino, the captain of Costa Concordia, enjoyed secret 2am sex sessions in his cabin

The Moldovan tour guide laughed off suggestions she distracted the captain but was on the bridge at the time of the crash

The cruise liner was carrying more than 4,000 passengers and crew when it sank off the island of Giglio in January last year.

Miss Cemortan said she and Schettino, who is currently on trial for multiple manslaughter and abandoning ship, had a meal together the night the cruise ship sank.

He later invited her to the bridge and she was with him and other officers when crash alarms went off.

Prosecutor said she was a distraction to Schettino but she says she was more than 150ft away from him at the time of the crash. 

She admits they passionately kissed on the night the ship sank but says they did not have sex.

Miss Cemortan also denied that their late night trysts made Schettino tired when on shift.  

She told The Sun: 'He is not stupid. He is a very good captain. I still respect him so much.'

Miss Cenmortan said Scehttino was not a coward but saved 'many lives' in the way he handled the sinking

Miss Cenmortan, who began her relationship with the married captain in December 2011, only admitted they had been lovers when she gave evidence at his trial this month.

Miss Cemortan told how she had first been introduced to Schettino by a colleague when she arrived on the cruise liner December 2011 to work as an international hostess, translating for Russians for three weeks.

She said he began timing his trips to parts of the ship so he could see her. They kissed for the first time after he called her into his office.

She says people were gossiping about their affair but she does not believe anyone saw them together.

Miss Cenmortan said Schettino was the 'god of the ship' and was a responsible captain

Thirty-two people died when the cruise liner sank off Giglio island, Italy, in January last year

The classically trained ballet dancer told Italian programme Domenica: 'When I see him I see a fashionable man, a smart man… For me he was fascinating because he was the captain. For the crew he was the strongest man on the ship. He is a god on the ship.

'In the first week he could not remember my name because it is not an easy name. But later he started to pay more attention to me… He started to speak with me, make jokes.'

Schettino was dubbed Captain Coward after the tragedy but Miss Cemortan said he saved 'many lives' in the way he handled the situation.

She said: 'If he was a coward, why was he not one of the first out?'

The captain, Francesco Schettino, is on trial in Grosseto, Tuscany, on charges of manslaughter, causing the 2012 shipwreck and abandoning the vessel before all others aboard were evacuated.

He faces 20 years in prison if convicted. The trial continues.
