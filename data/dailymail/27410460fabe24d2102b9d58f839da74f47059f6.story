As millions make their way to Mecca for the annual hajj - a religious journey that is viewed as one of the Muslim faith's greatest acts of worship - there are fears that a deadly virus could break out.

With so many people gathering at the Grand Mosque, it is claimed that it could become a breeding ground for the debilitating Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

The potentially lethal disease has been linked to camels, which can be slaughtered as part of a sacrifice for Hajj.

There are fears that the combination of so many people combined with the slaughtering of camels, which have been linked to the disease, could increase chances of an outbreak.

Since April 2012 cases and outbreaks of the respiratory disease syndrome have been reported in people who live in or travelled from countries in the Middle East, the World Heath Organisation said.

The fatality rate has been high, at about 60 per cent, the WHO reported.

A study into the link between camels and Mers was published in The Lancet after scientists found traces of antibodies against the Mers virus in dromedary camels, but not the virus itself, The National reported.

Almost two million people have so far arrived at the site in Saudi Arabia for the rites and another million are expected.

Hajj must be performed at least once in their lifetime by all Muslims capable of making the expensive, difficult journey - a duty that applies equally to Sunni and Shi'ite Muslims at a time of tension between Islam's main sects.

Health authorities around the world have warned unwell people to avoid the trip to Saudi Arabia for the annual Hajj pilgrimage.

Public Health England (PHE) and the National Travel Health Network and Centre said those wishing to travel should check the latest health advice following cases of respiratory illness caused by MERS-CoV.

In July, elderly Muslims were told not to take part in the annual pilgrimage to Mecca because of the Sars-like virus.

Pregnant
 women, children under the age of 12, or people who suffer from chronic 
illnesses should also abstain, according to advice from the Ministry of 
Health in Saudi Arabia.

Dr Brian McCloskey, director of global health at PHE, said today: 'The potential for spread of infectious diseases associated with mass gatherings is well recognised.

'Hajj, the annual mass gathering of over three million Muslims from all over the world, presents challenges every year, but particularly this year as we are continuing to receive reports of cases of MERS in the region.'

Dr Shuja Shafi, deputy secretary general at the Muslim Council of Britain, said thousands from the UK were expected to make the journey.

He said: 'Advice issued by the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health recommended that the elderly, those with chronic diseases, pregnant women and children postpone the performance of the Hajj for their own health and safety.

'People who have decided to go on Hajj this year and are unwell before travelling are being advised not to travel.'

Dr Dipti Patel, joint director of the National Travel Health Network and Centre, said: 'While there are no travel restrictions to the Middle East and the risk to travellers remains very low, the Saudi Arabian ministry of health has advised vulnerable people and children who may have been planning to travel to the Middle East to perform the Hajj to postpone their pilgrimage for their own health and safety.

'Other people should continue with their plans but follow the specific guidance on the Hajj and other general advice about staying safe and healthy when travelling, including practising good personal hygiene.

'It's very important that anyone who does become ill while making the pilgrimage urgently reports to the health authorities, so they can receive appropriate treatment and avoid spreading illness to others.'

In May, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said MERS-CoV is a 'threat to the entire world' and the disease is 'emerging faster than our understanding'.

Three people have died in the UK as a result of the infection - including one man who died at the end of June.
