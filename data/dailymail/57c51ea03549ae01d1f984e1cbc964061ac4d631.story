The few BBC presenters who did make it to work yesterday found themselves running a vicious Twitter gauntlet.

Dozens of militant unionists organised a ‘scabwatch’ to hurl abuse at those who chose not to strike.

Lucy Hockings was targeted for doing a live piece to camera, while presenter Jon Sopel and deputy political editor James Landale were slated for reporting live on the Prime Minister’s trip to Mumbai.

Even weather presenter Carol Kirkwood fell foul of the tweets.

The NUJ action meant viewers expecting to watch Bill Turnbull and Susanna Reid on BBC Breakfast were greeted by Gavin Grey instead.

The freelance journalist presented a short news summary between repeats of daytime shows and bulletins on BBC1 at regular intervals throughout the day.

A former regional ITV presenter, Mr Grey was used as a back-up newsreader in a 2010 BBC strike.

This time he found himself targeted by angry unionists who subjected him to a torrent of online abuse.

Peter Middleman, the north-west secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union, wrote: ‘Only a special breed of scab would do it on live TV. Step forward Gavin Grey, grabbing 30 pieces of silver.’

Donnacha DeLong, who describes himself as an ‘anarchist, NUJ activist, freelance journalist, social media journalist and new media consultant’ added: ‘Gavin Grey – scabbing again #bbcstrike #NUJ.’ 

Later in the day he tweeted a direct message of support to Newsnight economics editor Paul Mason – also on the picket line – saying: ‘Solidarity forever.’

Guy Walters added: ‘Gavin Grey, the newsreader the BBC use when there’s a strike. He’s probably the only Tory in the entire corporation.’

Daniel Giblin – who describes himself online as a ‘part time freedom fighter’ – wrote: ‘Carol Kirkwood breaks the strike again! Live on tv for all to see #turnitoff.’

However, one rarely-seen presenter did surprisingly well out of the strikes.

Ghanaian Komla Dumor, 40, usually presents on BBC World Service radio programmes, as well as BBC World News on TV.

He received a warm welcome from UK viewers when he was drafted into the BBC News Channel.

Andrew Pelling said: ‘Komla Dumor is great. Please let’s have him on @BBCNewsnight.’

Another, called Marianne, said: ‘I like this Komla Dumor newscaster on #bbcnews atm.’

A third user wrote: ‘I do enjoy all the new faces on a BBC strike day.’
