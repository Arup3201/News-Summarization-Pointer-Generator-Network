Barcelona's Brazilian star Neymar is looking forward to linking up with Luis Suarez at the Nou Camp and believes the duo, along with Lionel Messi, can become the most feared attacking force in Europe.

'Messi is the best in the world and Luis Suárez is a top player,' said Suarez. 'I think we're going to do great things together for this club.'

Suarez left Liverpool to join Barcelona for £75million over the summer but the Uruguay international has been restricted to training for his new club as he serves a four-month ban from FIFA for biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini during the World Cup.

Before the weekend's drama, Neymar and his Barca side face Ajax in the Champions League on Monday night.

'It's a very tough and very important match,' said Neymar on the crucial contest against the Dutch side.

'It's a must-win: we always play to win. Ajax are a very good team both defensively and going forward. We will have to perform well to win'.

'Last year we got knocked out in the quarters but I think we're better placed this year.

Neymar is in his second season with the Spanish club, after signing from Santos in 2013, and he admits that he is starting to more comfortable in his role leading Barca's attack.

'I don't know if I'm back to my best or this is a new Neymar,' he offered.

'Last year was about settling in, now I feel more at home and happier with everything. I'm enjoying living the dream of being at Barça.'
