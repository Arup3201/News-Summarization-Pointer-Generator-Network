Disgraced democrat Anthony Weiner’s campaign to become the next mayor of New York got off to an embarrassing start on Thursday after it was revealed that his website featured an image of Pittsburgh’s skyline rather than Manhattan.

Native New Yorker Weiner, 48, launched his campaign on Tuesday when he released a video in which he sought to portray himself as the champion of the outer boroughs and the middle class.

Weiner, forced to resign from politics two years ago after an embarrassing sexting scandal, grew up in Brooklyn and had previously represented parts of Brooklyn and Queens in Congress.

Bad day: Weiner's credentials as a native New Yorker took a bashing after his website was revealed to be using an image of Pittsburgh as its backdrop

People familiar with Pittsburgh's skyline recognised it as the original backdrop for Weiner's campaign website

The inaccurate image was first spotted by animator Richard Lampasone who tweeted: ‘I love to be reminded of Pittsburgh every time I visit @anthonyweiner's website and see a huge image of it above the campaign logo.’

At a quick glance, the image on Weiner’s website header might be mistaken for one of New York’s iconic bridges, but it is in fact the Roberto Clemente Bridge in Pittsburgh.

Weiner’s team haven’t commented on the embarrassing mistake, but his website has been updated twice on Thursday, first to a generic skyline image and then to a collage of five images from New York’s boroughs.

The company responsible for the website, NGP VAN, has admitted that the mistake was theirs.

‘This is our fault,’ VP of Marketing John Brougher told NBC4. ‘Our designer got the image from a set of images that included New York City images, but obviously this image was not of New York City, as the Weiner campaign had requested.’

Weiner's website was initially changed to display a rather generic image of a city skyline

Thursday was the former congressman's first official day of 
campaigning.

'There’s no doubt about it: I made 
very big mistakes,' he told WNYC, referring to the tawdry tweets 
that led to his resignation from Congress in 2011. 'I compounded it immeasurably by being dishonest about
it.

'I have apologized 
many, many times to my wife, and frankly I know that part of this 
process is going to be doing a lot of apologizing.'

Weiner
resigned from Congress after it was revealed that he had sent several 
women inappropriate photos of himself, including one of a bulge in his 
pants and another of him topless in his Capitol Hill office.

He called 
the behavior a 'blind spot' and said 'it was a thoughtlessness that I 
had about my private behavior.'

Weiner's wife, longtime Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin, has forgiven him - but she hasn't forgotten, he revealed.

'I
put her through some difficult things,' Weiner admitted. 'She says it’s
in the rear view mirror — but it’s not far in the rear view mirror.'

But that might change if more details of the scandal come forward in the course of his campaign - something Weiner has repeatedly warned could happen.

'It is what it is,' Weiner said. 'People may decide they want to come forward and say, here’s another email that I got or another photo. I’m certainly not going to do that. So people may hear things that are true, they may hear things that are not true, but I’m going to try to keep being focused on issues that are important to New York City.'

Weiner made the remarks as he set out
Thursday to reintroduce himself to voters, following the release of his
first official campaign video that featured his toddler son and 
targeted middle class voters.

He
started off his day of rebranding at a subway stop in Harlem, where he 
shook hands with voters and answered their questions about teacher 
contracts and manufacturing jobs - the kind issues that wants to be 
central to his campaign.

Anthony Weiner and his wife Huma Abedin appeared in a New York Times magazine article last month in which he revealed that he was considering running for mayor

Voter Linda Smalls, who encountered Weiner during his swing through Harlem, said the former congressman has her support.

'Even though he made a mistake, you 
know, we're human. He's human. He apologized for it, and it's time to 
move on,' she told the Associated Press.

Addressing a throng reporters was 
following him, Weiner said that he would be happy to talk about his 
'personal failings' if that is what citizens on the campaign trail want 
to discuss.

'[But] frankly, I think most New 
Yorkers, particularly those in the middle class in communities like 
this, they want to talk about the solutions to the challenges that New 
York City faces,' he said. 'That's what they care about and I want to 
try to provide some answers.'

A
recent Quinnipiac University poll has Weiner coming in second place 
among Democratic primary contenders with 15 percent of the vote. Ahead 
of him is City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, with 25 percent of the 
vote.

In his 'comeback' video released late Tuesday, Weiner says he's learned 'tough lessons.'

'I’ve
been fighting for the middle class and those struggling to make it my 
entire life,' he says. 'And I hope I get a second chance to work for 
you.'

The video opens with a scene inside the family home of Weiner, his wife and their son.

In an interview last month with New York Times Magazine, Abedin explained her decision to stick by her husband's side.

'Here
was a man I respected, I loved, was the father of this child inside of 
me, and he was asking me for a second chance,' said Abedin, who was 
pregnant with their first child at the time of the scandal. 'It was the 
right choice for me. I didn’t make it lightly.'
