New Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond today played down his Eurosceptic credentials as he prepared to take charge of efforts to claw powers back from Brussels.

His surprise promotion from the Ministry of Defence following William Hague’s dramatic decision to step down.

Mr Hammond, who has previously suggested he could back leaving the EU, insisted he was focussed on renegotiating Britain's membership and would not 'threaten' other member states.

Mr Hague, 53, will remain in the Cabinet as Leader of the Commons until next year’s General Election, when he will step down from Parliament.

But Mr Hammond's promotion is one of the most striking in David Cameron's reshuffle, coming at such a sensitive time for Britain's relations with Brussels.

The Prime Minister has promised to renegotiate the UK's membership of the EU, before holding an in-out referendum.

Last year Mr Hammond said he would vote to leave the EU 'if the choice is between a European Union written exactly as it is today and not being a part of that'.

Arriving at the Foreign Office to start his new job today, he told reporters: 'I'm going to focus on making sure that we have a successful renegotiation with our European partners,' he said.

'I don't think the way to enter a negotiation is to start issuing threats.'

Philip Hammond is not exciting.

He does not crack jokes or deliver spine-tingling speeches. He is no Boris Johnson or Ken Clarke.

The 58-year-old is a money-man, with the demeanour and precision of an accountant, who has impressed with his grip on the finances at the Ministry of Defence.

The new Foreign Secretary has a huge task ahead of him. With 10 months to go until the general election, he will have to start the process of David Cameron’s renegotiation of Britain’s membership of the European Union.

Crucially, Hammond has said that if powers are not returned, he would vote to leave the EU. Now it is his job to make sure that does not happen.

He is on the right of the party, having spoken out against gay marriage and defence cuts so vehemently last year he was said to be on 'manoeuvres' to position himself as an alternative Tory leader

The son of a civil engineer, he went to Shenfield High School in Brentwood, Essex, with TV presenter Richard Madeley, who once claimed the future Tory minister was ‘a Goth back then’ who ‘used to arrive in class in a leather trench-coat with The Guardian under his arm’.

Needless to say, straight-laced Hammond dismissed it as a wind-up.

After studying Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at Oxford – the apprenticeship for most of Team Cameron – he joined medical equipment firm Speywood Laboratories, where he later became a director.

He ran his own company and became a director of housebuilder Castlemead Homes, amassing an estimated wealth of more than £8million.

Elected as MP for Runnymede and Weybridge in Surrey in 1997, he was given his first job on the frontbench a year later by William Hague, who he now replaces at the FCO.

As George Osborne’s deputy in opposition, Hammond was expected to join him at the Treasury if the Tories won the 2010 election.

But coalition meant he was shunted to transport to make way for a Lib Dem, and was promoted to Defence Secretary in 2011 when Liam Fox was forced to resign.

Hammond’s ministerial career has often been buffeted by events outside his control.

Now he is one of the great offices of state, life could be about to get a bit ore exciting.

Tory Cabinet veteran Ken Clarke, who resigned last night after 40 years on the political frontline,  took a parting shot at the promotion of Eurosceptics like Mr Hammond.

Mr Clarke has vowed to continue to argue Britain must remain in the EU. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'Every government in this country is going to want Britain to stay in the European Union, it is the best way of affecting global political events and boosting our economy, the best way of protecting the interests of our citizens, it's a globalised world.' 

However, Mr Hague denied that naming Mr Hammond as his successor marked a more Eurosceptic approach from the Tories.

He said: 'We are very clear and united on Europe. Philip Hammond, David Cameron and I all have exactly the same policy on Europe.

'We want to improve Britain's relationship with the EU and then hold a referendum on staying in or leaving the European Union.

'We are all committed to that; the Conservative Party is more united on this issue than it has been in the whole time that I have been in politics, in all that long time.

'We are all going to be campaigning for that and I know Philip Hammond will be very committed to that.' 

Mr Hague's decision to quit as Foreign Secretary marks the beginning of the end of a political career that began in 1977 when, at the age of 16, he impressed then Tory leader Margaret Thatcher with an impassioned speech at the Conservative Party conference.

The move comes during a fraught period in foreign affairs when Iraq and Syria are in flames, Israel is on the brink, Russia is still menacing the Ukraine and Mr Cameron is engaged in a battle to keep Britain in a reformed European Union.

Mr Hague faced sharp criticism last month when, at a time of such global instability, he featured in a number of photo opportunities with the US actress Angelina Jolie, who was visiting the UK for a summit on sexual violence in warfare.

‘From May 2015, after such a long period in politics, I want to embark on many other things I have always wanted to do.

‘After the General Election, I will return to my writing, while still  giving very active support to  the Conservative Party and campaigning on international causes  I believe in.’

Mr Cameron paid tribute to the man who led the Conservatives during the dark period after the 1997 landslide defeat.

The Prime Minister said: ‘William Hague has been one of the leading lights of the Conservative Party for a generation, leading the party and serving in two cabinets.

‘Not only has he been a first-class 
Foreign Secretary – he has also been a close confidante, a wise 
counsellor and a great friend.

‘He
 will remain as First Secretary of State and my de facto political 
deputy in the run-up to the election – and it is great to know that he 
will be a core part of the team working to ensure an outright 
Conservative victory at the next election.’

Mr Hague said last night he wanted to pursue other options, including restarting his career as a political biographer. He tweeted: ‘Role as Leader of the House means I will finish in politics as I began – speaking in Parliament and campaigning among the voters.

Mr Hague’s departure after four years as Foreign Secretary will rob the Tory leadership of one of its most experienced hands.

He first came to public attention in 1977 when, as a Yorkshire schoolboy, he tore into the record of the then Labour government. 

The speech, applauded by Mrs Thatcher, marked him for greatness and helped fast-track his career. At the age of 27, he entered Parliament for Richmond, North Yorkshire. By the age of 34, he was in the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Wales.

Two years later, when the Tories were buried by the Blair landslide, the party looked to him to perform an impossible rescue mission.

Achievements: Hague spoke of his achievements during his time as Foreign Secretary in his message to his Twitter followers

Next step: Hague has been a key figure in the fight to end sexual violence in conflict

Starting young: Hague's announcement marks the beginning of the end of a political career that began in 1977 when, at the age of 16, he impressed then Tory leader Margaret Thatcher with an impassioned speech at the Conservative Party conference

Mocked: During his time as Tory leader he was mocked for wearing a Hague-branded baseball cap and for boasting that he had drunk 14 pints a night as a young man

Rumours: Speculation over Hague's future appeared to begin with a tweet from Iain Dale, the LBC broadcaster who is regarded as extremely well-informed in Conservative circles 

Mr Hague, whose quick wit and humour regularly saw him best Mr Blair in the Commons chamber, fought a Eurosceptic campaign, which culminated in the warning that Britain had ‘24 hours to save the pound’ from Labour’s desire to take the UK into the euro. 

But he was crushed in the 2001 election by a second Labour landslide.

During his time as Tory leader he was mocked for wearing a Hague-branded baseball cap and for boasting that he had drunk 14 pints a night as a young man. 

Bruised by the experience, he quit immediately after the election, giving way to Iain Duncan Smith. 

He returned to the backbenches where he wrote several well-received political biographies before agreeing to return to the front line as shadow foreign secretary in 2005.

Mr Hague is one of a relatively small number of northern Tories from ordinary backgrounds.

He was born in Rotherham and educated at Wath-upon-Dearne Comprehensive in South Yorkshire before going on to Oxford University, where he emerged with a first-class honours degree.

Despite his stellar political career,  Mr Hague has made little secret of the fact he believes there is life outside Westminster. He recently complained that his punishing schedule as Foreign Secretary leaves him time for nothing beyond working, sleeping and exercise.

His departure will also give him more time to spend with wife Ffion. The couple, who married in 1997, have no children.

But in 2010, Mr Hague – who was facing malicious rumours about his sexuality – spoke movingly of the fact his wife had suffered ‘multiple miscarriages’.
