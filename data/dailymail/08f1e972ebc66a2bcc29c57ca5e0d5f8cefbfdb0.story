A father-of-two has been jailed for taking out a payday loan - to start a business selling drugs.

Keith Lockett, 32, whose partner is due to give birth in June, borrowed the money to buy cannabis plants and for 'cultivation costs.'

Mr Lockett, described as a hardworking potter at a firm in Stoke, Staffordshire, had no previous convictions or cautions.

A father-of-two who took out a payday loan to set up a cannabis factory has been jailed. Keith Lockett, 32, cultivated the plants worth £15,000 in his spare room

Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard that 'completely out of character' and to raise money, he grew the plants worth £15,000 in his spare room.

He was only raided when neighbours reported an 'unusual smell' coming from his property.

Neighbours claim Lockett was a fan of US TV show Breaking Bad - which sees high school chemistry teacher Walter White (played by actor Bryan Cranston) being diagnosed with inoperable cancer and turning to a life of drugs crime.

Neighbour Denise Paul, 46, said: 'People on the street have been saying he was a fan of the Breaking Bad show. It certainly mirrors what he did as he was a respected man round here who was really popular.

'It is such a shame he turned his hand to this. It is out of character for him.'

Another neighbour, who asked not to be named, remarked: 'Keith was the last person I would have thought would have done this. He must have been badly influenced by some wrong people.'

Prosecutor Neil Ahuja said: 'When officers attended on April 21 it was clear that the rear upstairs bedroom had been converted into a growing room for cannabis plants.

'There were 29 plants in the process of being grown, supported by the usual paraphernalia.

'The electricity meter at the property had been bypassed to provide free power for this.'

The court heard the plants were a couple of weeks from maturity, and would have had an estimated street value of £15,000.

When he was interviewed by police Lockett, of Bentilee, Staffordshire, claimed he was growing the cannabis for his own use and it was a sole operation.

However, text messages on his mobile phone proved he had set up the operation with others, though Lockett is the only person to be charged in connection with it.

The electricity company said the estimated value of the illegally-used power, together with the damage to the meter, would be £1,536.

Lockett, who already has two children aged four and seven, pleaded guilty to producing cannabis and abstracting electricity.

The court heard he lost his job at a pottery firm as a result of his crime.

Hamish Noble, defending, said: 'It's clear Keith Lockett had his own difficulties with the misuse of cannabis and drinking too much.

Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard that 'completely out of character' and to raise money, he grew the plants worth £15,000 in his spare room. He was only raided when neighbours reported an 'unusual smell' coming from his property

'This operation started to offset the cost of buying cannabis, and the growth did better than expected.

'He would not have had all 29 plants himself, more like seven or eight. In the weeks leading up to his arrest he was considering pulling out of the operation.'

The court heard Lockett was 'ashamed and remorseful' but the judge said 'a message must be sent out.'

Jailing Lockett for eight months, Judge Fletcher told him: 'You knew this was illegal, you knew there was a risk involved, and now you know that when risks don't pay off there are consequences.

'You have affected yourself but, more importantly, your partner, your children and now your unborn child by this greedy and foolish behaviour.

'I see no reason why I should suspend the sentence.'
