They've toured museums, hosted a trade conference and even watched a high tech toilet maker present his newest design, but King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima are now on their way home to the Netherlands.

Before they boarded the plane, however, the couple attended a farewell supper with their hosts: Japan's Emperor Akhito and Empress Michiko.

Ever the style queen, Maxima pulled out all the stops for her final night on Japanese soil, turning out to meet the Japanese couple in a striking silver grey dress and a sparkling diamond brooch.

Glamorous: Maxima was chic in a silver-grey ensemble as she said goodbye to the Japanese couple

Trade: The three-day tour was intended to boost trade relations between Japan and the Netherlands 

Success: The Dutch and Japanese royal couples appeared to enjoy each other's company

The Dutch royal has won plaudits for her glamorous approach to all things fashion, and turned the Japanese visit into a sartorial tour-de-force courtesy of a wardrobe of well-chosen ensembles.

Striking though Maxima's wardrobe is, the Dutch couple's visit was almost eclipsed by the unexpected appearance of Crown Princess Masako, who made her first public appearance for 11 years during a state dinner held in their honour.

Masako, who was accompanied by her husband Crown Prince Naruhito for the event, had last appeared in public at a state dinner for the president of Mexico in 2003.

Since then, the 50-year-old has lived largely as a recluse, after succumbing to a stress-related illness after giving birth to her daughter, Aiko, now 12.

Japan boasts the oldest continual hereditary monarchy in the world, beginning with Emperor Jimmu who reigned from 660 BC.

Since then, 125 emperors have come and gone, with the most recent, Hirohito, famous for being head of state during the Second World War.

Unlike other members of the Japanese administration, he was not charged with war crimes and instead oversaw Japan's rebirth as a constitutional monarchy - a process continued by his son, Akhito. 

Maxima, who is the mother of three young children, has had no such problems and certainly appeared to enjoy the visit to Japan, which began on Wednesday.

The three-day visit, which was designed to boost trade between Japan and the Netherlands, saw the royal couple take in a design museum, before taking part in an investment development meeting alongside Dutch officials.

Unlike their Japanese counterparts, who have sat on the Chrysanthemum Throne since 1990 following the death of Emperor Hirohito, the Dutch royals are among the newest - and youngest - monarchs in the world.

Willem-Alexander, 47, was one of the beneficiaries of a spate of abdications in 2013 which saw his mother Queen Beatrix step down along with King Albert II of Belgium and Pope Benedict XVI.

Only Philippe and Mathilde of Belgium and Felipe and Letizia of Spain have been on the throne for a shorter period of time, with the latter two crowned in June following the abdication of Juan-Carlos.

But while Letizia and Felipe's reign has so far gone smoothly, Maxima and her husband have had a rougher ride in recent months thanks in part to the MH17 tragedy, which left the Netherlands reeling.

Nevertheless, since the crash, the popularity of the Argentina-born Dutch Queen has soared thanks to her tireless work on behalf of the MH17 families.

She has also attended some of the repatriation ceremonies and was seen sobbing from her perch beside Prime Minister Mark Rutte as the first flight arrived back on Dutch soil.

More recently, the Dutch royals have found themselves cheered to the rafters during public appearances, most notably when they appeared on the balcony of the Noordeinde Palace in the Hague on Prinsjesdag [Prince's Day], along with the former Queen Beatrix, 76

Maxima, 43, has also become a familiar sight at charity events around the Netherlands, with her most recent outing being at a symposium organised by women's rights activists in Amsterdam, which celebrated the 40th birthday of a Dutch law banning domestic violence.

With her husband, she also enjoyed a successful trip to New York last month, where she was seen chatting with fellow queen Letizia during a meeting of the UN General Assembly.

The pair were reiunited for the second time in a month two weeks ago, when the Spanish royals paid their Dutch counterparts a friendly visit in The Hague.
