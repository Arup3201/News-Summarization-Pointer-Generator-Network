At the age of 15, Juan Luis Vanegas Bravo weighed 320 pounds.

His brother, Pedro, weighed over 300 pounds at 14.

Obese from childhood, the pair came to be known as Mexico's fattest brothers.

But following the 2005 death of their father Juan Manuel - who died from complications of his own condition after having eight surgeries - the siblings knew they had to make a change.

Becoming the first minors in the country to receive gastric bypass surgery, they are now shadows of their former selves.

'I realized that if I didn't lose weight, I was going to end up like my dad,' Juan Luis told Vice.

'We had to try hard to get the surgery, though – I was underage at the time, so government-run hospitals wouldn't admit me.'

The pair first started getting fat when they were three because 'there was a lot of eating.'

'I started getting worried, so I took them swimming, to soccer practice, Taekwondo, anything,' said their mother, Juana, 51, said.

Today: Now 17, Pedro weighs 74.3kg, or 160 pounds, after having a balloon inserted into his stomach in 2010. The balloon is inflated to soak up room in the stomach where food would usually, dramatically decreasing your intake. He is now facing the weight loss-related problem of excess skin, which will require surgery to remove

'My mistake was having a duplex refrigerator and filling it with cold cuts every 15 days. Anything you craved, you could find it in our fridge.'

The mom said she didn't realize the condition her sons were in.

'You don’t realize how fat your children are,' she said.

'Every year they went to school, I had their trousers custom-made.

'I didn't realize they were a size 38 when they were six, or 40 when they were ten. And I didn't know how to reverse it when I did realize.'

In 2009, Juan Luis had a gastric sleeve applied in the Rubén Leñero General Hospital in Mexico City, reducing the size of his stomach between 60 and 85 percent.

Following the surgery he lost an astonishing 230 pounds.

New person: Pedro's transformation has allowed him to embrace his love of football. He has grade three obesity, a genetic condition he inherited from his father, who died of morbid obesity eight years ago

But, just as astonishingly, his body began to rebel, and the capacity of his stomach fought through the procedure and readjusted itself, causing him to put the weight back on.

In 2010, Pedro underwent his own surgical operation to combat obesity. He had a balloon inserted into his stomach which, once inside, is expanded so there's less room for food.

He had waited for three years for the surgery.

Afterwards he fell ill due to complications, contracting pneumonia and other infections, some caused by antibiotics.

After 73 days in hospital, he recovered.

In 2012, Juan Luis went underwent a gastric bypass surgery in the same hospital.

The procedure was far more serious, dividing the stomach in two, with the bigger half then enclosed by the intestine.

It is irreversible.

Jump forward to today and Pedro weighs 160 pounds.

The dramatic weight loss has caused an excess skin problem, which will probably require surgery to remove.

Juan Luis has used his weight loss to do what he has always dreamed - become a dancer.

He belly dances at a theater in Mexico City and makes his own costumes.

'When I perform I am free,' he said.

'I transform into what I'm wearing.

'If I'm wearing my light blue outfit I dance cheerfully - I feel like I'm in the desert dancing in an oasis.

'When I do a gothic number, I imagine myself in the woods listening to owls and crickets, and I feel part of that sad scene.

'It is magical.'

Mexico has one of the highest obesity rates in the world.

According to a 2012 National Health and Nutrition Survey, obesity in Mexico affects 32 percent of girls and 36.9 percent of boys between the ages of five and 11.

That adds up to around 5,664,870 children around the country.

This number increases in teenagers and adults.

Almost catching up with obesity levels in the United States – the fattest of the world's developed countries – 69.5 percent of the Mexican population above the age of 15 are overweight or obese, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.
