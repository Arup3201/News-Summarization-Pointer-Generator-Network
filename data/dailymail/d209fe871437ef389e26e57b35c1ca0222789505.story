Under-fire Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal insists his team have done ‘rather well’ this season and that he has great chemistry with his players at Old Trafford despite widespread discontent among supporters over recent results and the team’s style of play.

United’s indifferent league form and FA Cup exit against Arsenal on Monday have led to doubts on whether the current squad are buying into van Gaal’s ‘philosophy’.

However, the Dutchman has robustly defended his record. 

Louis van Gaal is targeting second place in the Barclays Premier League with a late push in the run-in

The Manchester United manager believes catching local rivals Manchester City is an achievable target

City are just five points ahead of United in the Premier League table, with Arsenal four behind City

‘We lost the first match against Swansea and had a bad start but in spite of the bad start we are a stable club in the top four,’ said Van Gaal.

‘When you are so long there after such a bad start, I think we’ve done rather well.

The coming matches are very decisive. We are so close to a lot of clubs. We can be second or third. It is not a big difference, I believe.

'Manchester United have to be one of the teams who have to play in the Champions League.'

United have only lost twice in the league since early November but have ridden their luck in certain games and are currently fourth, 10 points behind leaders Chelsea, and in grave danger of not qualifying for the Champions League for the second successive season.

The financial implications of missing out would be devastating but Van Gaal insists that is not his concern.

‘I don’t think that I’m here to think about the financial consequences, that is (for) Ed Woodward,’ he argued. ‘I’m here to manage the professional football department.’

Manchester United have attracted unwelcome publicity all season. Expensive signings Angel di Maria, Juan Mata and Radamel Falcao have failed to shine. 

Van Gaal said that United 'have to be one of the teams' who  play in the Champions League next season

City and United face each other before the end of the season, and that could make a big difference

Sergio Aguero and Co haven't been up to their usual standards at the Etihad and that could help United

Last weekend, defender Jonny Evans was banned for six matches for spitting at Newcastle’s Papiss Cisse. A bullish Van Gaal declared his relationship with the United squad is first-class.

‘When I think the chemistry between the players and the manager is not good enough anymore, then I go, he added.

‘But when I see this chemistry between myself and my players then I don’t have any doubts,’

Manuel Pellegrini will have his eyes on the teams behind him... as well as Chelsea in front

Ryan Giggs and Van Gaal haven't had the greatest season but are still well in with a chance of a top four spot

Van Gaal rejected the opportunity to discuss how close he came to having Mauricio Pochettino's job

Pochettino was believed to be on a shortlist with Van Gaal before he was given the Spurs job last summer
