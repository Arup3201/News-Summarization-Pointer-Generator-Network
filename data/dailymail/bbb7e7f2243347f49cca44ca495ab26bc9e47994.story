Tourism chiefs in Scotland have claimed the crippling lack of mobile and internet signal in rural areas is a good thing - because it is sparking 'digital detox' holidays.

The report by Visit Scotland said the 'joy of missing out' on e-mails, texts and Facebook is creating a generation of niche breaks devoted to the 'novelty of Luddism!'

But business leaders attacked the plan - pointing out Visit Scotland's own figures which say visitors complain about internet access more than any other issue.

Switching off: Walkers in the Torridon mountains in the north west Highlands. Tourism agency Visit Scotland has said the lack of mobile and internet signal can be marketed as a good thing for 'digital detoxes'

'Hello? We're in Scotland!' The idea was one of 17 trends but was criticised by business leaders

The idea was listed as one of 17 'trends for 2014' in a report for the taxpayer-funded body which included 'Mod-stalgia' ('embracing the past through the comforts of today'), 'techspectations' ('life is becoming more digital every day') and 'never pay full price for pizza'.

The report said: 'Overuse of smartphones, the rejection of technology will see consumers seeking meaningful and emotional experiences. Scotland’s off-grid locations will enable this.

Signal failures: The service for mobile operator O2 is notably lacking in the Scottish Highlands

'The novelty of Luddism! Although technology is and will be a driving force for many years to come with tourism, some providers have identified a niche market for those who want to escape digital life (albeit temporarily).

'Health and wellbeing tourism has excelled in recent years with the use of low cost gyms, and healthy eating.

'Psychological health is also identified as an area for growth, with many providers offering packages such as "Tai Chi" breaks in the Scottish Highlands as a means of escape from everyday digital life, providing an opportunity for consumers to detach from life, and regenerate.'

The report did admit the breaks - which were identified as something that had grown through 2013 - would not be popular with everyone.

It added: 'Although the majority of consumers 
would not see this as a positive aspect, many would identify Scotland as
 a destination to escape and "detach" from the digital world.'

Much of Scotland's most beautiful and isolated countryside is poorly-served by mobile phone firms.

The Highlands and islands are affected especially badly, because of their difficult terrain and thinly-spread population.

In VisitScotland's latest visitor report, 45 per cent of people said they had not been satisfied with internet access - more than for any other issue.

It compared to 42 per cent who complained about the cost of travel, 41 per cent about the convenience of sea routes and 34 per cent about mobile reception.

End of the earth? Walkers on the West Highland Way. Firms have started offering Tai Chi breaks

Natural beauty: The gaping skies above Ben Loyal. The Highlands have been a popular getaway for centuries

The idea has caught on among some - with one new firm, digitaldetoxing.com, offering £299-a-head breaks in a Norfolk cottage with strictly no screens allowed.

The firm took a group on a 'secret' trip to Mallorca earlier this year and plans a visit to Scotland in May.

But Marc Crothall, chief executive of the Scottish Tourism Alliance, criticised the idea.

'For 25 per cent of the country not to have proper mobile phone access is just not good enough for the modern day,' he said.

'We need to have full coverage across the whole country as soon as possible.'
