Radamel Falcao's miserable start to his Manchester United career has continued with news that he faces a further two weeks out with injury.

The Colombian international must impress manager Louis van Gaal over the course of the season if his big-money loan at Old Trafford is to be turned in to a permanent deal at the end of the year.

However, as United prepared for a trip to Arsenal on Saturday with crippling injury problems across their defensive line, the long-term future of centre forward Falcao continues to be in doubt.

United boss Van Gaal said last night: 'No, he's not available. He has an injury and that takes time.

'Now it's four weeks already and next week he shall train with our selection and then he needs two weeks. It's always like that.

'It's a pity, but players in football are injured.'

Sportsmail revealed earlier this month that Van Gaal already has doubts about Falcao's ability to withstand a long Barclays Premier League season. Certainly, statistics that show just one goal and three league starts already go some way to showing why the United manager is concerned.

Having let England striker Danny Welbeck go to Saturday's opponents at the end of the summer transfer window, Van Gaal knows that decision could come back to embarrass him at the Emirates but insists he does not regret his decision.

'He could have also played for Manchester United but we have decided that he could go and he has taken the benefit of it,' said Van Gaal.

'He does very good at Arsenal. Now I shall see him [play] and I shall judge him.

'He has taken all the benefits of playing every week. That was always the question mark here.

'But I don't think it is so important how I judge him because he is now playing for Arsenal.

'He's not a Manchester United player anymore so now we have to beat him also. He's not alone, we have to beat Arsenal.'

Van Gaal has had better news this week regarding goalkeeper David de Gea who has recovered from a dislocated finger suffered on international duty and will play on Saturday.

However, United will be without first choice defenders Rafael da Silva, Jonny Evans, Phil Jones, Marcos Rojo and perhaps Luke Shaw. Dutch international midfielder Daley Blind, meanwhile, will not know the extent of his knee injury suffered playing for Holland until he removes a brace in 10 days' time.

'It's difficult to say how long because he is still sitting in his brace,' said Van Gaal. 'We will then scan him again.

'It is not as bad as the doctors thought after the first match but it could still be a long story. It isn't six months or so, though.'

United winger Angel di Maria will play at Arsenal after recovering from a knock he picked up playing for Argentina on Tuesday.

Asked if he been worried, Van Gaal said: 'I'm always a worried man in Manchester because we have a lot of injuries.

'It's unbelievable. But we have to manage. We can speak about all the injuries, but we still have to manage that.

'I've said that also to the players. It's a pity, but we have enough players to do the job.'
