Ex-Ex Gay: John Paulk, pictured here as he looks today, was once the face of the gay conversion therapy movement

A man who was once one of the most visible advocates of so-called gay conversion therapy has now come out as still gay.

You might call John Paulk ex-ex-gay.

In 1998, he appeared on the cover of Newsweek alongside his wife. The headline asked ‘Gay for Life?’

Now estranged from his wife and sporting a much less conservative 
look, including long blond hair and a deep tan, Paulk seems to have the 
answer.

And if you haven’t figured it out, it’s a yes.

‘My
 beliefs have changed,’ Paulk told PQ Monthly, which stands for Proud 
Queer. ‘Today, I do not consider myself “ex-gay” and I no longer support
 or promote the movement.’

This is a huge departure from 
Paulk’s prime ex-gay days, when he founded and ran a ministry called 
Love Won Out based on what he called ‘reparative therapy.’

The
 psychology community would now, as much of it did back then, be quick 
to balk at the idea of using therapy to change one’s sexual orientation.

But
 Paulk was a true spokesman for the technique and was even chairman of 
the board of Exodus International, one of the most well-none ex-gay 
organizations.

Paulk also penned two books on the subject: Not
 Afraid To Change: The Remarkable Story Of How One Man Overcame 
Homosexuality and Love Won Out, which he wrote with his wife, who also 
claimed to have rid herself of her own homosexuality.

Then: In 1998, Paulk appeared on the cover of Newsweek touting his belief in conversion therapy and ran a Christian ministry based on those beliefs

He 
remained at the forefront of the ex-gay movement until September of 
2000, when it was widely reported that the self-proclaimed born-again 
heterosexual was seen living it up in a Washington, DC gay bar.

Now,
 the 50-year-old says he’s come along way and apologized for harm he’s 
done to people close to him and to the LGBT community as a whole.

Changed: Paulk wrote two books on gay conversion with wife Ann, pictured, but now makes his living in the catering business

‘Please allow me to be clear,’ Paulk said. ‘I do not believe that reparative therapy changes sexual orientation; in fact, it does great harm to many people.’

He later said: ‘I know that countless people were harmed by things I said and did in the past.’

Paulk’s wife Anne, according to PQ, remains a vocal proponent within the ‘reparative therapy’ movement today.

Paulk now supports himself in the food service industry, running a catering company in Portland, Oregon called Mezzaluna Catering, and says he no longer profits from his former job.

‘I don’t get any royalties from these publications,’ he told PQ Monthly. ‘I discourage anyone from purchasing and selling these books or promoting my “ex-gay” story because they do not reflect who I am now or what I believe today.’
