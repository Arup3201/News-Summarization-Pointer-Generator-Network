Guilty: Hotel receptionist Attila Ban, pictured at work in his uniform, has been found guilty of killing two colleagues

A hotel receptionist who killed two colleagues and then hid from police inside the bed where he dumped one of the bodies is facing life in prison after being found guilty of their murders.

Attila Ban stabbed Tibor Vass, 20, before murdering Alice Adams, also 20, after participating in a threesome with the pair.

The 32-year-old killer even updated his Facebook status from his hiding place during the early hours of August 10 last year as police searched for clues into the violent deaths of his co-workers, writing: 'I'd like to wake up from this nightmare.'

A jury at the Old Bailey heard how performing arts student Miss Adams, who had only worked at the hotel as a receptionist for three weeks, was found fully-clothed lying on the floor of Ban's staff quarters at the Radisson Edwardian Hotel at Heathrow Airport, with a cushion over her face like 'a discarded rag doll'.

She had been stabbed 22 times on the 
front and back of her body, penetrating her heart, left lung, spleen, 
stomach and diaphragm.

Hungarian-born
Ban had stabbed Mr Vass twice in the heart and carried his body to a 
double bed after cutting off the dead man's t-shirt and boxer shorts, 
leaving him naked.

The 
court was told that openly gay Ban had an unrequited crush on fellow 
Hungarian Mr Vass, becoming agitated in the days before the killings 
after Mr Vass won a place at a university back in Hungary.

Ban
had been jealous about Mr Vassâ€™s relationships, and just days before 
the killing launched an outburst at his victim during a team building 
exercise when he took a picture that did not feature Ban, the court 
heard.

The court heard it was the sight of the pair kissing that drove Ban to murder after the group had played drinking games, took poppers - a well-known sexual stimulant - and toyed with the idea of group sex.

Colleagues discovered the bloodied scene when the three receptionists failed to turn up for work the next morning, summoning police to the flat in New Road, Harlington.

Detectives combed the sealed-off quarters for clues but did not discover Ban, who was named as the hotel's employee of the year in 2010, until the second day of their investigations.

He was lying on another double bed after attempting to take his own life.

He had tried to slit his wrists with modelling knives and electrocute himself with a hairdryer in the bath.

Officers found that Ban had water and his mobile phone with him and had cut a slit in the divan bed that he hid in so he could observe the investigation.

Tibor Vass was due to return to Hungary to attend university, while Alice Adams studied performing arts

'So throughout the time of those that had been in the flat dealing with the investigation and removing the bodies, it appears Ban was concealed under the bed, no doubt able to hear everything that was said and sufficient presence of mind to keep himself concealed despite all that that was going on around him in that flat at the time.'

Ban had pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, but the jury at the Old Bailey found him guilty of the double murders.

Officers had searched the loft area of the quarters after failing to find bloodied footprints leading away from the crime scene.

Outside court, Detective Inspector John Finch said police had not been negligent for not looking under the bed.

He said: 'I have looked back at this several times with senior management. It was such a strange and bizarre thing for a person to do. It beggars belief.'

He said crime-scene examiners would lose crucial forensic evidence if they lifted up beds looking for people who were not there.

Mr Finch added: 'I would not want anyone to do anything differently in the future.'
