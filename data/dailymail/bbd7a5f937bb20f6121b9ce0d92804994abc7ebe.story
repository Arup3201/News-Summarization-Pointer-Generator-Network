He is leaving it late but Andy Murray’s charge to qualify for the World Tour Finals in London continues to gather pace.

Murray is bidding to reach the season finale for the seventh year in a row and his status at No 8 in the year-to-date standings puts him in line to claim one of the three remaining spots in the elite eight-man field at the O2 next month.

*Standings on Thursday October 23 

The 2013 Wimbledon champion dismissed Fognini’s challenge in just over an hour. There was an element of revenge as Fognini, the world No 19, beat Murray in their Davis Cup quarter-final. 

Murray’s timing has been perfect. Last week he won the Vienna Open and ended a 15-month title drought in Shenzen. 

The loser in Austria was David Ferrer, another rival on the Race to London and top seed in Valencia. Ferrer and Murray could meet again, with the Spaniard overcoming his compatriot Fernando Verdasco 6-3, 6-2.  

The third seed was comfortable throughout, and didn't face a break point in the entire match

Before that Murray must find a way past South African Kevin Anderson. If the Scot can go all the way he could jump to fifth in the standings, with Tomas Berdych’s first-round loss to Pablo Andujar having boosted his chances.

There was no chance of any upset on Thursday. Murray was 3-0 up after 13 minutes and had the first set in the bag within half an hour. 

The British No 1 broke again in the fifth game of the second set and held serve to clinch the match. Murray has yet to pick up any points in Spain for this year’s race but that will change if he overcomes Anderson, who he beat in the fourth round at Wimbledon this summer, to reach the semi-final. 

Murray was delighted with the win, the 27-year-old is finally finding his form again after a difficult year

Canadian Milos Raonic closed the gap on Murray to 45 points in the Race to London by coming through a tight second-round encounter in Basle.

Fourth seed Raonic hit 23 aces, including on match point, to beat the USA's Donald Young 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 7-6 (7-2) in two hours and 20 minutes.
