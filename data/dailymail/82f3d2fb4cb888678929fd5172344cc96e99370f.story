He was accused of shamelessness and a lack of chivalry after stealing a football that was intended for a woman at a Cincinnati Bengals game and refusing to give it back.

Now, Tony Williams has told of why he intercepted the ball, which was thrown by tight end Jermaine Gresham to supporter Christa Barrett after he scored a touchdown  against the New Orleans Saints.

The 70-year-old, who appeared to hit Ms Barrett with his elbow as he snatched the object, said he took it for for his eight-year-old grandson - and will not be giving it back.

'I really wasn't intending to hurt anyone, do anyone harm. My motive was just to keep the football for my grand baby, and if I did hurt the lady, I didn't mean anything,' said Mr Williams, a Saints fan.

Stubborn: 'I really wasn't intending to hurt anyone, do anyone harm. My motive was just to keep the football for my grand baby, and if I did hurt the lady, I didn't mean anything,' said Mr Williams (pictured), a Saints fan

'If that would have been a child, I would have gladly given the football to the child. I didn't want to upset no one because I love this city... and I love the Saints.' 

In a personal message to Ms Barrett, he added: 'Christa, I really didn't mean any harm, all I was trying to do was get a football for my grandbaby. I didn't mean to touch you or hurt you at all.'

But the intended recipient's joy quickly turned to disbelief when Mr Williams plucked the ball from her arms - and refused to give it back, despite her pleading with him for several minutes.

'He was not budging at all', Ms Barrett, a Versailles, Kentucky, native who now lives in New Orleans and was watching the game with her sister, Cara Meadows, told the Cincinnati Enquirer.

And Gresham could not believe the pensioner's actions either, pointing to Ms Barrett to show it had been been meant for her. Later in the game, the Saints handed the fan another ball amid cheers.

Following Sunday's incident, thousands of football  fans took to social media to express their shock at Mr Williams's actions, with many declaring 'chivalry was dead'.

But Mr Williams, from New Orleans, told WWL-TV: 'Believe me, with me chivalry is not dead. I love my wife. I love my daughter, ladies, and that hurts. What they're saying is it was intentional. That hurts.'

The pensioner added that the online 'bullying' has upset his grown-up children as well as his grandson, who worried about his grandfather's welfare and how he would be treated at school. 

Mr Williams's wife, Minnie, told the news station she and her husband - who formerly served in the U.S. Army in Germany and used to be a King Zulu - have had Saints tickets since season two.

Response: Ms Barrett (pictured speaking following Sunday's game) and her sister were in the aisle celebrating when Gresham threw the football. She has since said she has 'no hard feelings' toward Mr Williams

Speaking out: During a local TV appearance on Sunday, Ms Barrett (pictured, left and right, in Facebook photos, said she would donate anything Gresham gave to her to the Devon Still's campaign for pediatric cancer

She said it hurt her when the crowd cheered as Ms Barrett was  handed another ball to take home, saying: 'That made my husband look like the bad guy and he is really not a bad guy.'

'He was getting that football for his one and only grandbaby,' she added. 

Speaking after the game, Gresham, told the Associated Press that Mr Williams 'should be ashamed of himself', adding: 'You can put that on the record.'

He later wrote a message to Ms Barrett's sister on Twitter, saying: 'Truly sorry about you guys not getting that ball. I'll make sure you guys receive something greater for compensation.'

During a TV appearance on WDSU on Monday, Ms Barrett said she would donate anything Gresham gave to her to the Devon Still's campaign for pediatric cancer.

She added that although she was heartbroken at the time of the incident, she has 'no hard feelings whatsoever' toward Mr Williams and feels like any football fan would have lunged to get the ball.

'I was a little upset and heartbroken at the time, because it would have been awesome to have that ball, but I have no hard feelings or anything like that toward him. I'm glad she got it.

'I think the pictures make it look ten times worse than it actually was. I have no bruises.' 

Gresham had scored a touchdown in the third quarter of Cincinnati's 27-10 victory against the Saints. Ms Barrett and her sister were in the aisle celebrating when he threw the football.
