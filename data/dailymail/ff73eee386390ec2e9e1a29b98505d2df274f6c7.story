Ashley Holland, who has been dubbed 'Spyder', gave up his career as a carpenter to become a full-time professional free runner scaling huge buildings. This picture shows him at the top of scaffolding on St. Guys Hospital overlooking London

Mr Holland, seen here in action, got involved with the dangerous sport 14 years ago. Since then he has scaled buildings up to 142 metres tall

He said: 'I love Spiderman and his story. Instead of reading about his stories I just wanted to do what he does so I did.'

Mr Holland appeared on the first ever series of Britain's Got Talent and reached the live semi-finals after being approached by show bosses who had seen his YouTube videos.

But his stunts have not always gone successfully and have landed him in trouble with the police three times.

'I was arrested in Barcelona after I'd climbed up the outside of an 18-storey tower block. They didn't charge me though, they just asked for a photo with me and then let us go,' he said.

He recently worked with indoor climbing instructor,  Andy Hall from Birmingham, when the pair scaled  St. Guys & St. Thomas Hospital in London, which stands at 142 metres.

Mr Hall, 34, said: 'It was 4am in the morning and it was freezing cold and windy. We jumped the fence and started to climb to the top of the hospital.' 

Since his television appearance, Mr Holland has been inundated with requests and has appeared in award winning drama Here After and more recently, Alt-J's music video 'Hunger of the Pine.'

He now takes his free running skills across the UK's schools, helping pupils understand science through his stunts and tricks.
