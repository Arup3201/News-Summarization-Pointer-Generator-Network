Frederick Sanger, the ‘father of genomics’ and a two-time Nobel Prize winner, has died at the age of 95.

The Gloucestershire-born biochemist is described as ‘one of the greatest scientists of any generation’.

He pioneered methods to work out the exact sequence of the building blocks of DNA and was also at the forefront of work to uncover the structure of proteins.

Frederick Sanger, the 'father of genomics' and a two-time Nobel Prize winner, has died at the age of 95

Dr Sanger won his first Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1958 for work on determining the structure of insulin .

He set out to determine the entire sequence of chained-together amino acid building blocks in a protein.

This involved separating the different fragments of protein on filter paper and then moving them with an electrical current.

The result was a distinct pattern on the paper, which Dr Sanger called a 'fingerprint'.

The information about these fragments then had to be reconstructed in the correct order.

Using
these methods, Dr Sanger revealed the entire sequence of the 51 amino 
acids that make up insulin, and showed how they linked together.

It was the first conclusive evidence that proteins are constructed from a defined molecular sequence.

He was one of only four people to have won two Nobel prizes, the highest honours in science – and the only person to have won two Nobel prizes in chemistry.

Frederick Sanger’s name was adopted by the world famous Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Hinxton, Cambridgeshire, where Human Genome Project scientists conducted much of the research leading to the first complete blueprint of the human genetic code.

In 1958 Dr Sanger received the honour for his work on the structure of proteins. Then, in 1980, he shared half of the chemistry prize for his contribution to research on DNA sequencing.

He later turned his attention to the sequencing of nucleic acids and developing techniques to determine the exact sequence of the building blocks in DNA.

Dr Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, said: ‘Fred can fairly be called the father of the genomic era: his work laid the foundations of humanity’s ability to read and understand the genetic code, which has revolutionised biology and is today contributing to transformative improvements in healthcare.

Professor Colin Blakemore, former chief executive of the Medical Research Council, called Sir Sanger ‘a real hero of 20th century British science’.

Dr Frederick Sanger was born on August 13, 1918, into a Quaker family in the village of Rendcombe, Gloucestershire.

His father, also Frederick, was a local GP.

He
was educated at Bryanston School in Blandford, Dorset and then St 
John’s College, Cambridge, where he studied natural sciences.

At
Cambridge, Dr Sanger became interested in the emerging field of 
biochemistry, believing it could offer a way to understand and tackle 
medical problems.

Dr Sanger took his degree in 1939 just as the Second World War broke out, 
but as a conscientious objector stayed on at the university for a 
further year to take an advanced course in biochemistry.

Earlier he had not shone as a student, taking three years to complete the first part of his degree, yet he obtained a First.

From
1940 on he conducted research at Cambridge University’s Department of 
Biochemistry. In 1951 he was awarded the Corday-Morgan Medal and Prize 
of the Chemical Society, in 1969 the Royal Medal of the Royal Society, 
and in 1977 the Royal Society’s Copley Medal.

He was honoured with the Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award in 
1979, and the Gold Medal of the Royal Society of Medicine in 1983.

Dr Sanger became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1954.

He was appointed CBE in 1963 and made a Companion of Honour in 1981, but turned down a knighthood.

'A
knighthood makes you different, doesn’t it, and I don’t want to be 
different,' he was quoted as saying. However he accepted the Queen’s 
special gift of the Order of Merit in 1986.

Dr Sanger retired in 1985, after which he was said to have devoted much of his time to his garden.He
married his wife, Margaret Joan Howe, in 1940, who he said contributed 
more to his work than anyone else by providing a peaceful, happy home. 
The couple had two sons and a daughter.

‘His invention of the two critical technical advances - for sequencing proteins and nucleic acids - opened up the fields of molecular biology, genetics and genomics,’ he said.

Professor Blakemore added that Dr Sanger was a ‘disarmingly modest man’ who once said: ‘I was just a chap who messed about in his lab.’

Born in 1918 in Gloucestershire, Sir Sanger initially planned to follow his father into medicine, but instead pursued a career in biochemistry.

Professor Sir Mike Stratton, director of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, said: ‘His work for his second Prize, a method to decode DNA, has transformed our understanding of life on earth and is the foundation of developments in healthcare from understanding inherited disease to developing new cancer treatment.’

‘It was an honour for this Institute when Fred acceded to founding director John Sulston’s request that we be named after him. Fred’s only stipulation was that “it had better be good”.

‘That typically Fred response is our inspiration and will continue to be so.’
