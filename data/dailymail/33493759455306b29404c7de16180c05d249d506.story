The home of Manchester United star Angel Di Maria has been put up for sale just weeks after he suffered a terrifying raid while eating dinner with his family inside. 

Burglars used scaffolding poles to smash their way in to his home through patio doors while the Argentina winger, his wife Jorgelina and one-year-old daughter Mia were at the Cheshire mansion.

Now the sprawling home, which Di Maria rents from a private landlord, has been put on the market for £4.1million amid reports that his wife is too scared to return to the property.

Burglars are believed to have used scaffolding poles to smash their way in to his home through patio doors while the Argentina winger, his wife Jorgelina and one-year-old daughter Mia were at the Cheshire mansion

The mansion, which is set in manicured grounds in Prestbury, Cheshire, is now on the market for £4.1million

Di Maria and his family reportedly moved into a luxury hotel after the incident with round-the-clock security keeping them safe. They now look set to move away for good, with the luxury mansion up for sale.

It has also been suggested that a recent drop in form can be attributed to the break-in. 

The Daily Mail's Martin Samuel writes: 'Searching for clues to the recent decline of Angel di Maria, the break-in that occurred at his house in January cannot be overlooked. Di Maria’s form had dropped off before that, true, but not as alarmingly as it has in recent weeks. 

'He wasn’t getting hooked at half-time before this event. 

'Alvaro Negredo suffered a similarly shattering blow that ended his family’s love for their new country. He was not the same player after it happened. Di Maria is believed to be relocating his family to a new, high-level apartment following their traumatic experience.' 

The estate agent's advert says: 'Magnificent mansion set in well-manicured grounds in the heart of Prestbury on a private road.

'Indoor swimming pool with glass panels into the sitting room and hallway which truly envelopes the pool into the heart of the house.'

The home also boasts a plush kitchen and family room, with French doors leading to a huge garden.

There is also a sitting room with a drop-down screen, a children's TV room, a play room, an office, a gym, changing room, an indoor pool and jacuzzi and a two-bedroom apartment over the garage.

The fully-furnished home is described as 'very high-spec and high-tech'.

Di Maria signed from Real Madrid for £60m in the summer. But his future at United remains uncertain, with rumours rife about a return abroad.

According to reports, he could be offered an escape route out of Old Trafford by Paris Saint-Germain.

Di Maria, however, has maintained he is happy at United. 

Di Maria's daughter Mia was born three months premature on April 22, 2013 - the night before her father's then team Real Madrid faced Borussia Dortmund in a Champions League semi-final.

He missed the game to be with his wife and their baby spent the next two months in intensive care before the couple were allowed to take her home.

The footballer has previously said of his little girl: ‘My daughter taught me that everything that appears to be really difficult can end up being easy if you put the effort in and wait for the rewards.

‘She transmitted so much energy to me and it helped me to have the spectacular year that I had.’

The Argentinian international, 26, was reportedly eating dinner with his wife and young daughter when a gang attempted to smash their way through the mansion’s patio doors during a raid last month. But they ended up fleeing empty-handed after triggering the home’s alarm system

Cheshire is popular location for Premier League star and several players’ homes have been targeted by burglars in the past.

Everton and England defender Phil Jagielka was robbed at knifepoint at his home near Knutsford in 2009.

Stoke striker Peter Crouch suffered two break-ins, in 2011 and 2006, at two properties he’s owned in Cheshire.

United star Darren Fletcher’s wife and mother were threatened with a knife when raiders burst into their home in Bowdon in 2009.

The wife of Bolton striker Emile Heskey was also held at knifepoint when a gang raided their mansion in Hale.

The series of raids led to claims that top footballers were installing panic rooms in their homes.
