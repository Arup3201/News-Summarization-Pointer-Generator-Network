A-levels in foreign languages should be made easier so that more students get top grades, the exams watchdog suggested yesterday.

It said just one in 14 pupils received A*s in some modern languages, compared with one in six for maths.

One solution would be altering the exam to make top marks more achievable, a spokesman admitted.

‘If there’s something about the design currently that’s preventing that [top grades] then it’s something we’d have to look at,’ he said.

Too difficult: An exam watchdog has called for A-levels in foreign languages to be made easier to ensure that more students get top grades

The proposal is likely to be unpopular with Michael Gove, who is trying to end grade inflation by making exams more robust.

End-of-course exams replacing bite-size tests on modular courses is one of the measures being introduced under the Education Secretary’s watch.

Students will also be prevented from taking multiple resits to boost results.

Concerns over foreign languages emerged in Ofqual’s corporate plan for 2013-2016, released the week before this year’s A-level results.

Data shows 39.4 per cent of entries for French A-level last summer were awarded an A or above, with 6.8 per cent getting A*. In Spanish, 36.5 per cent got an A, with 6.8 per cent achieving an A*.

In German the figures were 41.4 per cent and 7.9 per cent.

Not a fan: The proposal is likely to be unpopular with Michael Gove, who is trying to end grade inflation by making exams more robust

But in maths, 43.9 per cent got at least an A and 17.4 per cent received an A*. In further maths, more than half were A-grade students and 28.6 per cent of those got the top grade.

One in ten physics entrants got an A*, with 31.9 per cent getting at least an A.

The Ofqual report said there were no plans to ‘recalibrate’ A-level standards when the new-style exams  are introduced from 2015.

But it added: ‘There are two features of performance standards at present that we plan to address.

‘First, relatively few A* grades are awarded in modern foreign languages when compared with other subjects with a high proportion of A grades.

Secondly, there are variations in the proportion of A* to A grades awarded at A-level each year in subjects.

‘We plan to evaluate ... and to make improvements so that standards are as comparable and consistent as possible.’

Experts said there were reasons for top grades being harder to come by in some subjects.

Professor Alan Smithers, of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at Buckingham University, said: ‘It is perfectly possible to get full marks in maths or further maths, provided you’ve got the talent. The questions are such that you are working for a  particular solution.

‘When it comes to foreign languages, there’s an element of interpretation. You can be very good and get an A but you may not have the fluency of a native speaker.’
