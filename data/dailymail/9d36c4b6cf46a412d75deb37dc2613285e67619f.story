Sportsmail's Chief Sports Writer Martin Samuel did the double at the 2014 SJA British Sports Journalism Awards on Monday, picking up Columnist and Sports Writer of the Year.

The Daily Mail was named Newspaper of the Year, while Matt Lawton picked up Sports News Reporter of the Year and Graham Chadwick scooped Sports News Picture of the Year.

Elsewhere, Jack Gaughan and Adam Crafton were both highly commended in the Young Sports Journalist of the Year category to top off an exceptional night for Sportsmail.

Sports Writer of the Year: Martin Samuel

Sports Columnist of the Year: Martin Samuel 

Newspaper of the Year: Daily Mail

Sports News Reporter of the Year: Matt Lawton

Sports News Picture of the Year: Graham Chadwick

Young Sports Journalists of the Year: Jack Gaughan and Adam Crafton (both highly commended)

Samuel claimed a record-equaling sixth Sports Writer of the Year gong  after picking up the award in 2005, 2006, 2007, 2010 and 2013. 

He is now on level terms with Hugh McIlvanney, and goes one ahead of former Sportsmail legend Ian Wooldridge and former Mail on Sunday Chief Sports writer Patrick Collins, who retired earlier in the year.

Samuel fought off stiff competition to collect the Sports Columnist of the Year award earlier in the night, with the judges stating: 'His views are strong and fresh, frequently contrary to that held by the general public, but always backed up by good factual information.'  

The Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday's Chief Sports Reporter Lawton scooped his award after an impressive year, in which he broke the news of Malky Mackay and Iain Moody's text scandal during their time at Cardiff.

His award comes less than a fortnight after he was named Sports Journalist of the Year at the UK Press Awards, receiving praise for not only his Mackay exclusive, but also interviews with sacked Manchester United manager David Moyes and cricketer Jonathan Trott.

Elsewhere, the Mail on Sunday's Chief Sports News Correspondent Nick Harris enjoyed success on a personal note, picking up the award for Specialist Sports Website for Sporting Intelligence. 

Collins, meanwhile, has also taken over as president of the Sports Journalists' Association.

Collins, who retired in January after almost 50 years on Fleet Street - the last 32  at the Mail on Sunday - takes the reigns from Sir Michael Parkinson.

During his stellar career, Collins picked up 11 SJA awards, including SJA Sports Writer of the Year a remarkable five times.
