Smile for the camera! This tiny hairless wombat clearly knew the value of saying 'cheese' with a photo of her flashing her pearly whites taking over the Internet.

The photo of 'Leah' the baby wombat smiling cheekily at the camera while sitting in her colourful throne, was taken by a ranger who rescued her from her dead mothers pouch six weeks ago.

The picture was taken on Saturday and posted on the Parks Victoria Facebook page, and his since been shared nearly 30,000 times and featured in Reddit's infamous Photoshop Battle.

Lucky Leah the wombat is all smiles after beings found still inside her mother's pouch after the pair were hit by a car.

On Wednesday Leah's picture was chosen as the subject of the latest 'battle' and the creations that resulted from her humble picture on Facebook are very....creative.

From the Lion King and The Blues Brothers to Titanic and Harry Potter, no film was off limits.

Each week Reddit's PhotoShop enthusiasts are challenged to manipulate a chosen photo then share it with the group.

The winner gets a three month premium membership to Reddit, they then get to pick the photo for the next battle and most importantly, kudos from everyone on the Internet.
