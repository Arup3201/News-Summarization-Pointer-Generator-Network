A loving father who also happens to be an animator for renowned studio Dreamworks has created a series of hilarious videos that cast his adorable three-year-old son as a pint sized superhero.

Using his special effects know-how from work, Daniel Hashimoto has created the videos of his son, James, for YouTube under the name Action Movie Kid.

Many are spoofs on real movies and show James wielding a light saber, entering the Matrix, and scaling a wall like Batman.

Mr Hashimoto honed his skills on Blockbusters like How to Train Your Dragon and Kung Fu Panda 2, but he says his son prefers games to movies.

'I made them mostly because he is really funny and imaginative,' he told the Daily News. 'James doesn't watch TV or movies very much.'

The cute videos have racked up hundreds of thousands of views in just a few short weeks - some in just days.

'It's humbling and I'm excited that a little hobby I have is enjoyable to other people,' Hashimoto said.
