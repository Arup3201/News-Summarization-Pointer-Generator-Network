An injection that prevents breast cancer is being  developed by scientists.

In laboratory tests on mice, the jab stopped the disease in its tracks 75 per cent of the time.

The scientists described their results as ‘amazing’ and said that by stopping the cancer before it starts, the injection could spare thousands of women the trauma of surgery and gruelling radiotherapy.

'New approach': A jab has been developed that 
can in 75 per cent of cases block the development a very early form of 
breast cancer called ductal carcinoma in situ, potentially sparking 
thousands of women from surgery

British experts said the research was exciting but warned that the drug is still at an early stage.

The main beneficiaries are likely to be women with a very early form of breast cancer called ductal carcinoma in situ, or DCIS.

It is diagnosed in almost 5,000 women a year in the UK and involves changes in the cells that line the milk ducts.

It only progresses to full-blown cancer in about half of cases.

But
 doctors can’t tell which women this will happen to, so most patients 
have to undergo surgery and some have the whole breast removed.

Women
 who have inherited genes that place them at extremely high risk of the 
disease – such as film star Angelina Jolie – could also benefit by being
 given preventative jabs every six months.

The
 actress underwent a double mastectomy last year after discovering she 
carries a faulty gene that gave her an 87 per cent chance of developing 
breast cancer.

Researcher 
Don Ingber, of Harvard Medical School in the US, said: ‘Right now, there
 is really nothing to give these people besides these drastic, cautious 
treatments. The findings open up the possibility of someday treating 
patients who have a genetic propensity for cancer.’

The drug does not help to prevent other types of breast cancer, as they will have  progressed too far before they are spotted.

Dr Ingber’s team began by pinpointing a gene that fuels the early growth and spread of breast cancer.

They
 then used genetic material known as small interfering RNA to shut down 
the rogue gene in cancerous cells in a dish. This partially reversed the
 cancer.

When the drug was 
injected into mice destined to develop breast cancer, three-quarters of 
the animals remained healthy. By contrast, all of the untreated 
creatures were struck down by the disease, the journal Science 
Translational Medicine reports.

Dr
 Ingber described the results as ‘amazing’. He said: ‘This provides a 
way of treating it early and preventing it ever getting there.’

The same approach could be used to tackle other cancers, as well as other diseases caused by genetic flaws.

Dr Ingber added that it should be possible to refine the drug to make it even more effective.

Much
 more research is needed but, eventually, women with DCIS or genes that 
put them at high risk of breast cancer could be given a six-monthly jab 
to keep the disease at bay.

Dr
 Kat Arney, of Cancer Research UK, said: ‘This is an exciting new 
approach, although it’s important to remember that it’s only been done 
in mice so far and this kind of approach is still highly experimental.’
