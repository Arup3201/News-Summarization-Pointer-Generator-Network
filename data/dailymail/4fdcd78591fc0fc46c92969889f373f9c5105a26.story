Stevie May struck a sweet solo goal to shoot Sheffield Wednesday up the Championship table and keep Birmingham in the relegation mire.

The Scotland Under-21 striker picked the ball up in the left channel, dribbled into the area and drove a low shot past Darren Randolph at his near post to seal all three points in the 67th minute.

Substitute Jeremy Helan added a second with a minute to go, slotting home from the penalty spot after Chris Maguire’s centre.

The goals sent Stuart Gray’s side into seventh and extended Birmingham’s winless run to five Championship matches.

Lee Clarke’s side had started the game with purpose and created an excellent chance within four minutes.

David Davis strode forward and whipped a pass to Wes Thomas, who backheeled the ball to a stop on the edge of the area to set up Clayton Donaldson. But he sent his shot high over the bar.

Wednesday responded and could have taken the lead had Atdhe Nuhiu volleyed Maguire’s cross on target rather than just wide. It was almost too sweet a connection by the Austrian, already with four goals this campaign.

Clarke’s side continued to make most of the running though, producing good openings only to fluff their finishes.

Paul Robinson headed David Cotterill’s corner wide and then Cotterill curled a super cross onto the head of Thomas only for the striker to miss badly. Brek Shea, on loan from Stoke, cracked a shot into the side-netting.

Soon after Paul Caddis thought he had scored a goal of real quality from 25 yards, letting fly a missile of a shot that looked in until it hurtled against the post.

Thomas was then put through by Robinson but Kieren Westwood was out quickly to smoother his finish.

Birmingham looked vulnerable on the counter attack however, and within five minutes of the restart twice went close to conceding the opening goal.

Jacques Maghoma led a swift breakaway from a Birmingham corner and fed Maguire, who swept a shot from the edge of the area just wide.

Maghoma then hit the outside of the left post when following up Liam Palmer’s low shot that was edged away from goal by the fingertips of Randolph.

Referee James Adcock curiously booked Nuhiu for catching the ball with May down injured – there was to be no Paolo Di Canio-style aggrandisement here – but the 21-year-old picked himself off the turf to claim the decisive goal.

The £800,000 summer signing from St Johnstone collected the ball on the wing and with Birmingham’s defence backtracking advanced into the area before finishing confidently past Randolph. It was Wednesday’s first goal in 247 minutes after two games failing to find the net.

Birmingham pressed for an equaliser and captain Robinson was denied by a superb block in the six-yard area.

But Wednesday made the game certain in the 89th minute when Helan, who had come on for May eight minutes earlier, converted Maguire’s cross with a controlled finish.
