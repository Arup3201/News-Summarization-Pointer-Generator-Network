A pair of rare ospreys returned to their nest in Wales after spending the winter in Africa to find two rival birds had moved in.

Monty and Glesni, regular stars on BBC's Springwatch, discovered their nesting site had been taken over by squatters - two other ospreys.

Birdwatchers watched as the birds of prey fought over the lofty nest of twigs near Machynlleth, Powys.

Ospreys are migratory birds and are also known as sea hawks, fish eagles, river hawks or fish hawks.

They are fish-eating birds of prey that are active in the day and sleep at night.

They can be found in a wide variety of habitats on every country except Antarctica.

It is classed as a bird of 'Least Concern' on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

Emyr Evans, of the Dyfi Osprey Project near Machynlleth, said: 'All hell broke loose.

'Monty arrived to find a strange female bird in the nest and soon presented her with a large fish - which is like chocolates and flowers to a bird of prey.

'But then his partner Glesni turned up and the feathers flew.'

After a scrap the two intruders were sent packing but the female visitor was still hanging around.

The two visiting ospreys - nicknamed Dai Dot and Blue 24 - normally spend their summers 180 miles away in Rutland, East Midlands.

Upon discovering the intruders, a fight between the birds soon broke out...

Monty and Glesni raised two chicks Cerist and Clarach last year at the nesting site which is kept secret to stop raids by illegal egg collectors.

Both adult birds were fitted with GPS tracking devices for BBC viewers to follow them during their winter migration to Africa.
