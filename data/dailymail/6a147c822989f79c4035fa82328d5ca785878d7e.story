An Iranian woman who swam 20km wearing a hijab has been denied the official record because her outfit showed her 'feminine features'.

Elham Asghari designed a special 'Islamic' bathing suit adding 6kg to her weight so that she would be allowed to attempt the long-distance swim on the Caspian Sea in June.

But the outfit was apparently not modest enough for the country's conservative religious authorities, and her record was not officially recognised.

Plea: Elham Asghari was denied a 20km swimming record because of her 'immodest' outfit

The 32-year-old took nine hours to swim the 20km (12.4 miles), setting out from the town of Nowshahr into the freezing waters of the Caspian.

She did so in defiance of officials who are opposed to women swimming in open waters because of the risk of displaying their body shapes to men.

Even though Ms Asghari wore a loose-fitting swimsuit which included a headscarf, the authorities were opposed to her efforts - and refused to acknowledge that she had made it the full 20km.

'They said no matter how Islamic my swimming gear, it was unacceptable,' she told the Guardian earlier this year. 'They said the feminine features of my body were showing as I came out of water.'

'Feminine features': Iranian authorities are keen to discourage women from swimming in open waters

In a bid to gain public support for her battle against the authorities, she made a haunting video of herself swimming around while wearing the swimsuit - which she claims most swimmers would be unable to handle.

'I swam 20km in Nowshahr, they lowered it to 15km,' she says in the video, posted on YouTube. 'I protested and they accepted 18km. Yet now, they do not register the record.

'My 20km record has been held hostage in the hands of people who cannot even swim a distance of 20 metres.'

The video then cuts to Ms Asghari sitting in a car wearing a headscarf, when she delivers an inspirational message aimed not just at fellow swimmers but at all women living in the theocratic state.

'I'm not going to submit to bullying, and I ask you not to submit either,' she says. 'I ask you to give your utmost effort to achieve your goals.'

Anger: The swimmer has had a number of run-ins with the conservative religious authorities

The Nowshahr incident is not the first time the swimmer has met with official resistance to her athletic activities.

During a previous open-water swim, Ms Asghari was blocked by police boats which ended up cutting her legs with their propellers.

Women in Iran are allowed to swim in segregated swimming pools, and to compete in the Women's Islamic Games which are held periodically in Tehran.

However, they are banned from travelling to competitions abroad, and the authorities frown on swimming in open waters.

'They fear that if they recognise my record then they would unwittingly approve my swimming gear and that would eventually give women swimmers access to open waters,' Ms Asghari told the Guardian.

She has expressed hope that the new regime led by Hassan Rouhani might prove more accommodating than that of Mahmoud Ahmedinejad.
