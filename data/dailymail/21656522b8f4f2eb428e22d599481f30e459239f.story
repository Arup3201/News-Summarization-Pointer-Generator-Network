A stalker raped a pregnant woman and then forced her to breastfeed him after she gave birth.

Kevin Gibbons, 50, caused immense psychological damage to the woman and another victim - both of whom he subjected to horrifying sex crimes. 

Gibbons abused the women then quoted passages from the Bible to justify his depraved actions.

Jailed: Kevin Gibbons, 50, abused two women and then quoted passages from the Bible to justify his  actions

His terrorising behaviour, which included stalking, came to light when by a twist of fate, both women ended up living in the same street and the police learnt of their ordeals. 

A Greater Manchester Police detective described him as 'one of the most vile, controlling, abusive and cowardly men I have ever encountered during all my years in policing'.

Gibbons, of Standish, Wigan, was found guilty of 11 charges, including stalking, rape, false imprisonment and sexual assault, following a trial. He was jailed at Liverpool Crown Court yesterday for 25 years.

The court heard how Gibbons targeted his two victims for more than a decade, subjecting them to physical, verbal and sexual abuse, harassment and stalking to the point both felt 'hunted' and prisoners in their homes.

His first victim said she feels he has 'sucked the life out of me' and the judge said she remains extremely fragile.  

His other victim, whom he raped while she was pregnant and then made breastfeed him when she had given birth, had a breakdown and was suicidal for a time.

On one occasion, he forced her to have sex and filmed it and then threatened to reveal it to others.

One victim was forced to keep her curtains closed as Gibbons repeatedly drove past and parked outside her home.

He intimidated her where she worked, bombarded her with unwanted photos, cards, letters and messages and left her in total fear of living her life.

When his car and home were searched, officers found a collection of knives and even a bow and arrow he kept in his car while he stalked the women.

Gibbons also locked one victim in her bedroom and refused to allow her to leave if she simply disagreed with him and could only bargain for her freedom by having sex.

His second victim was repeatedly raped and sexually abused.

Det Con Sheena Maerevoet said: 'The facts of this appalling case speak for themselves. Gibbons is one of the most vile, controlling, abusive and cowardly men I have ever encountered during all my years in policing and I have no hesitation in saying that he deserves every second of his lengthy prison sentence.

'At the heart of this investigation are two innocent women who were subjected to years of horrific sexual and physical abuse. 

'These women felt unable to cope, prisoners in their own home, hunted and haunted by Gibbons to the point they felt like they could not even go to the shops. In some instances, both felt like dying.

'That is an utterly heartbreaking and tragic indictment of just how abusive Gibbons was.

'Not only that, but he showed zero remorse and failed to take responsibility, subjecting these women to the terrifying ordeal of having to relive what happened in the adversarial environment at court.

'Their bravery cannot be overstated. Despite everything they have suffered, they showed true courage to give evidence at court and thanks to their tenacity and refusal to allow Gibbons to get away with it, an extremely dangerous man is now behind bars.'

During his sentencing report, Judge David Aubrey told Liverpool Crown Court: 'The harm you have caused has been immense and long-standing.

'You are, and remain, a significant risk of causing women serious sexual and psychological harm. You are, and remain, a dangerous person.'
