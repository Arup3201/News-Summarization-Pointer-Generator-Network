Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has revealed that UEFA restrictions on the size of his club's Champions League squad is likely to prevent him pushing for new signings this January.

The transfer window opens on Saturday morning and some City fans are expecting Pellegrini to spend in a bid to strengthen his team in the absence of injured strikers Sergio Aguero and Edin Dzeko.

But City's Champions League squad is restricted to 21 – rather than the usual 25 - as part their punishment for breaching Financial Fair Play regulations and Pellegrini hinted last night that this is likely to be a decisive factor.

'I think we are not thinking about the window,' said the City manager.

'We have the option. We will see players we can bring or sell or go on loan, but it is not our first important thing at this moment.

'We will see during January what will happen.

'But we have important restrictions about amount of money and restrictions on players we can put in our Champions League squad.

'So it's difficult to bring in a player when he cannot play in the Champions League.'

City are functioning with just one frontline striker at the moment, Stevan Jovetic playing and scoring against Sunderland on New Years Day.

However Pellegrini hopes Aguero and Dzeko will return in the next couple of weeks.

'I hope in the next week Edin Dzeko will be fit and in the next week will be Kun [Aguero],' added Pellegrini.

Captain Vincent Kompany is recovered from the hamstring injury that has caused him to miss recent games but will not be risked in the FA Cup against Sheffield Wednesday at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday.
