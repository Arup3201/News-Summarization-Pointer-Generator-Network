A groom who sparked a mass brawl on his wedding night told a group of teenagers he would 'knock them out with one punch' before butting, glassing and throttling his three victims.

John Derick Sandham, 31, was at his wedding reception at a pub in Holywell, Flintshire, when he launched an attack on a group of young friends also having a drink at the venue.

The court heard how Sandham, who had swapped vows with his wife Clare just hours earlier, head-butted one victim before hitting him in the face with a glass or a bottle.

He then grabbed another of the teenagers by the throat, before hitting the third victim on the back of the head, Mold Crown Court was told.

Sandham, from Bagillt, near Holywell, had claimed he acted in self-defence, saying: 'This was my wedding night. It is supposed to be the happiest day of my life and it was blighted by this.'

But a jury at Mold Crown Court convicted him of all three assaults. He has now been bailed until his sentencing hearing.

The court heard how the wedding took place on August 24, 2013 before the reception at The Abbott’s Arms.

The victims, who were aged 16 and 17, were not part of the wedding party.

The court was told how one of the victims went for a cigarette while the others were in the porch 'having a laugh and messing about'.

The defendant then walked through the porch, where he was said to have asked the friends what they were saying.

He then walked straight up to the group and grabbed one of them, before launching the gurious attacks. 

The jury heard how one of the teeangers needed hospital treatment for cuts to his nose after being struck with the glass.

He told the jury: 'We were just having a laugh. There were no issues.

'He turned around and asked what we were saying? We said we did not want any trouble but he said he could knock all three of us out with one punch.'

The groom had claimed he only went through the porch to say goodbye to wedding guests, who were leaving by taxi. He said he had left his glass inside the venue. 

He also claimed that the teenage friends had started growling at him and 'went for him'.

He told the court: 'Everyone there had a fantastic day, all the guests, all the friends and family, the children, it was brilliant. Then it was blighted by this.'
