The wait is almost over... It's been months in the making and the sacrifices on both sides have been huge.

But finally, on Saturday night, after three long months, all of it will have been worthwhile - as Rachael Cordingley will be able to have sex with her partner Carl Froch again.

With his IBF and WBA world super-middleweight belts on the line, Froch does not want to head into this fight undercooked as he did in the first bout.

Reunited at last: After spending three months in separate rooms, Froch and Rachael will be back together soon

And that has impacted on Rachael too, who has been forced to keep her hands off her man since February so that he does not lose any testosterone.

The 27-year-old model told The Sun's Hayley Coyle: 'The sex ban is so hard for me - but Carl tells me he isn't that bothered because he's exhausted and it's the last thing on his mind.

'After such a long wait it's really good to have our sex life back to normal and to have that closeness again, to be able to have sex like a normal young couple.

'I seem to get pregnant straight after a sex ban, maybe because it's been so long. Then I have the baby to coincide with the next fight.'

Having been with Froch since 2008, Rachael has had to forgo sex on numerous occasions - but that hasn't made it any easier for her

In the build-up to the Cobra's rematch with George Groves, Froch has dedicated himself to his training.

He struggled early-on in the first fight against Groves in November after being floored in the first round and only won via a controversial stoppage by the referee in the ninth.

That result forced a rematch to be ordered by the IBF, leading to this Saturday's bout at Wembley.

Froch, 36, is determined not to repeat his mistakes of last time and has been sleeping in a separate annexe in his £1million Nottingham home since February and leaving Rachael all alone in their room.

But come Saturday, Rachael will be cheering her man on at ringside in anticipation of their long-awaited reunion after.
