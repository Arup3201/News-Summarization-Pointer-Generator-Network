A little boy made a powerful argument as to why he should have a cupcake for dinner - and the video his mother took of him making it went viral.

Three-year-old Mateo didn't want to eat dinner. He felt that since he'd already eaten lunch, a cupcake would make a suitable compromise.

When this argument failed to win over his mother Linda Beltran, he decided he might have better luck with his grandmother.

A born politician: Mateo makes a rambling yet adorable argument for cupcakes

Beltran says that if Mateo thinks he has a valid argument, he's sure to speak his mind.

This time, Beltran happened to have her phone with her so she hit record just as Mateo got into his stride.

Mateo, looking up at his mother and unaware he's being filmed, entreats his mother to 'Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me!'

While most of the argument is unintelligible, the gist seems to be that he deserves a cupcake and definitely not 'pow pows in the butt [a spanking].'

His love for his little brother Kevin is admirable, too. Linda says that she's going to have to spank both Mateo and Kevin, but Mateo says she shouldn't spank him, nor his little brother.

'But he's my little Pa-Paps!' he says.

The video goes for two minutes and 35 seconds, but arguably the most hilarious part comes at 1:42, when he begins to refer to his mother as 'honey.'

'Linda, honey, honey, lookit, look at this,' he says.

Beltran says Mateo calls her Linda when he is very serious and wants to make sure she is paying attention.

'Linda, honey, honey': Even in the face of such convincing sweet-talk, Linda Beltran doesn't give in to her son

He began using his parents' first names after the family went on a trip to a theme park and came across a little boy who had lost his family.

He didn't know his parents' names, other than Mommy and Daddy, and Beltran and her husband realized their children might not know their names either, in a similar situation.

Knowing his parents first names, Beltran said, 'made Mateo feel a little empowered.'

'For the most part we are still Mommy and Daddy,  but when he is serious and wants to make sure we are paying attention, we quickly become Linda and Kenneth,' she told UberConference blog.

Beltran says Mateo is never disrespectful, but loves to engage in healthy debate.

'The boys know when mom is serious and when they can engage in some healthy debate. In an effort to raise my kids with a voice, I pick my battles and sometimes let them feel like they’ve won... or at least give them the chance to try!'
