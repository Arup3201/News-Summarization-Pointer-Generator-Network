Investigators found five guns and a laptop computer in the vehicle of a man suspected of killing three people in a shooting spree, a police chief said Sunday, but they hadn't yet uncovered any motive for the rampage.

John Lee, 29, was arrested following a high-speed chase in nearby Washington state after the shootings Saturday.

Police believe he opened fire at three locations in the western Idaho city of Moscow, killing his landlord, his adoptive mother and a manager at a restaurant his parents frequented. A Seattle man was also critically injured.

Investigators searched Lee's car and apartment late Saturday night, Moscow Police Chief David Duke said. They found two semi-automatic pistols, a revolver, a shotgun and a rifle in the vehicle, along with a laptop, he said.

Ballistics tests were expected to help determine which weapons might have been used in the shootings.

Authorities were seeking a warrant to search the computer, he said.

'There's still nothing to identify a specific motive as to why Mr. Lee took these actions,' Duke said. 

Police said Lee's killing spree began with Terri Grzebielski, 61, who had adopted him. He then allegedly tracked down his landlord, 76-year-old David Trail, and killed him too.

Police say he also shot Michael Chin, 39, of Seattle during that portion of the attack. Trail died at Pullman Regional Hospital and Chin was listed in critical condition Saturday night at Gritman Medical Center in Moscow.

The shooter then drove to an Arby's restaurant and asked for the manager. When she appeared, he pulled out a gun and opened fire. The manager, 47-year-old Belinda Niebuhr, died at the Moscow hospital.

Duke said that Trail, the brother of a former Idaho state representative, was Lee's landlord. He said there were 'some issues' regarding the apartment, but didn't know of any eviction proceeding.

Chin was discussing business with Trail when the gunman arrived. Duke said Chin was shot in the arm and leg, and would be flown to a Seattle hospital.

Investigators have yet to find any link between Lee and the Arby's manager.

'We know he didn't work there,' Duke said.  The chief said that the surviving workers did not recognize Lee.

Kelsey Stemrich said she was working at a cafe near Arby's when she and a customer heard three gunshots and then saw people running from the restaurant. She says they took down the license plate number of a car seen pulling away from the Arby's and called it into police.

Police in Washington spotted the suspect's black Honda and a chase involving multiple agencies ensued. Pullman Police Chief Gary Jenkins said the pursuit lasted nearly 25 miles and Lee's vehicle at times topped 100 mph before crashing off Highway 195 north of Colfax and rolling to a stop.

Lee was taken to a Colfax hospital for treatment of minor injuries before he was booked into the Whitman County Jail on a charge of felony eluding.

Investigators had yet to recover the gun. Duke said it was probably still in the car and detectives were awaiting a search warrant Saturday night before looking for it.

Moscow authorities had yet to announce any Idaho charges late Saturday, saying the investigation remains active.

Moscow is a city of about 25,000 people in northern Idaho. It's about 10 miles from Pullman, Washington.
