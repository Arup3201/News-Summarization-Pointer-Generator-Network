After a sodden summer of washed out weekends and rained-on barbeques, many have given up any hopes of some pleasant weather.

But, at last, it looks like September could bring a much needed glimpse of sunshine and some warm weather to the UK.

The Met Office has predicted a string of sunny days across the UK that should last until Sunday which will come as a huge relief to many - even if it does mean most children won't get to enjoy it as they are back to school.

A spokesman for the Met Office, said: 'London has woken up with very nice weather and most of the UK is seeing lots of sunshine.

'It should stay dry, it looks as if this weather will last until Friday, and should last into Saturday too, I'd say.

'There is a very weak band of cloud travelling south east, so it might get a little colder this evening, but it should not last.'

People have leaped at the chance to catch some rays of sunshine, with office workers basking in the heat and many making sure they head outside in their lunch break to make the most of the warm weather.

In Scarborough, north Yorkshire, families flocked to the beach to paddle in the water and soak up the blue sky.

Visitors to Cambridge decided to take to the city's rivers and lazily punted in boats as the sun gave them an unexpectedly bright Tuesday.

The Met Office gave the good news that some high pressure should mean the weather stays settled, dry and mostly bright - although northern Scotland might have a few bouts of rainy showers.

The southern half of the UK should encounter mostly sunny, bright weather, and the north is expected to see a few spots of rain.

Although northern Scotland will have some cloud, residents there won't entirely miss out asthey will see dry weather too.

The Met forecast said: 'Tomorrow looks set to offer yet more good weather.

'It will be fine and dry with some warm sunny spells for most, particularly in southern UK.

'A few showers are possible over parts of Scotland, where winds will continue to ease.

'Up to Saturday Scotland and Northern Ireland will be windy at times, with outbreaks of rain.

'England and Wales will be drier and increasingly warm, with early mist patches clearing to sunny spells.'
