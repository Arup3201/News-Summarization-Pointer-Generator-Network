They say breaking up is never easy and for Rex Ryan it proved to be a particularly painful split. 

When the NFL coach had a racy tattoo of his wife inked on his arm, wearing nothing but a New York Jets jersey, it was supposed to be a touching gesture to his team.

But the tattoo backfired when he was fired  just two years later after six seasons at the helm, and left with a painful reminder of his past.

Moving on: Rex Ryan has his New York Jets jersey tattoo re-coloured blue for his new team the Buffalo Bills

Taking inspiration from countless celebrities Mr Ryan decided to head back to the tattoo parlour and get his very own breakup tattoo.

For $80 dollars an artists in Arizona  changed the jersey from Jets green to blue, to match his new team The Buffalo Bills, Wall Street Journal reported.

'I mean, you've got to turn the page,' he told the publication.  

Staff at the Arizona tattoo parlor where Mr Ryan had his tattoo altered shared pictures with the coach

Out with the old: Rex Ryan's old racy tattoo of his wife wearing nothing but a green New York Jets jersey

Mr Ryan first showed off the tattoo of his wife, Michelle, depicted in a New York Jets jersey in January 2013.

The 52-year-old was fired by the team in December last year and  swiftly hired by the Bills, just two weeks later.

The alteration to the inking took place as he was in Arizona, where the Superbowl was taking place at the weekend.

Mr Ryan has also given away all his Jets clothing to a Salvation Army store in New Jersey as he moves on with his new team, the Wall Street Journal reported.
