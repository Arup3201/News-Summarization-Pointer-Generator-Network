A grandfather has been rescued from a canyon after getting stuck there while leading a troop of Boy Scouts across Arizona's rugged outback.

Ken Barnum, 70, was struck down by a heart condition while hiking through the West Clear Creek area, several miles east of Camp Verde.

The group of four adults and eight boys ran into trouble when they entered a steep canyon on Saturday afternoon.

Most of the boys were able to negotiate the rough terrain and climb out to safety but the eldest member of the group was forced to stay after growing weak from his medical condition.

Accompanied by his son and grandson, he spent the night in the bowel of the canyon and waited for help. Two others were also stranded.

The alarm was raised when the group failed to show up at an arranged meeting spot.

Finally on Sunday they were airlifted to safety. The man is recovering in hospital where he is being treated for cardiac issues.

Authorities say four adults and eight teens were reported missing around 3 p.m. Saturday after they failed to show up at a meeting spot.

Deputies and the Arizona Department of Public Safety found the group three hours later.

Sheriff’s spokesman Dwight D’Evelyn says they stayed overnight because rescuers had to wait for daylight.
