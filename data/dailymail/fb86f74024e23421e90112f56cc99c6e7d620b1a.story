Tragic: Conor MacMannis, 20, died early this morning after falling from a ninth floor balcony at the Penn Towers building on Beaver Avenue in Pennsylvania

A 20-year-old college student has died after falling from the ninth-floor balcony of a Pennsylvania apartment building, just eight months after his younger brother passed away.

Conor MacMannis was reportedly alone when he tumbled from the Penn Towers complex on Beaver Avenue about 3.45am this morning.

Police said drugs and alcohol were factors in the Pennsylvania State University student's fall. He died from his head injuries.

The Centre County coroner this afternoon ruled the death as accidental, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported.

'It's tragic,' Penn State spokeswoman Annemarie Mountz told Onward State. 'We're trying to come to grips with it ourselves. It's just so sad.'

This latest tragedy comes just eight months after MacMannis' brother, 15-year-old Aiden Hall MacMannis, died - a devastating blow for parents Andrew and Kathryn MacMannis who lost two of their three sons in one year.

Conor MacMannis paid tribute to Aiden on his Facebook page on the day his brother died:

'Treasure your family. Regardless how much you may fight, argue, and say you hate each other because they aren't going to be around forever,' he wrote on March 17.

'RIP Aiden MacMannis you'll always be my little brother and I love you for that.'

Conor, a kinesiology major, was a talented member of Penn State's track and field team.

At the Eastern Collegiate Athletic Conference (ECAC) indoor championships in early March, he led the way for his team with a third place finish in the high jump, clearing 1.97m.

His father, Andrew MacMannis, was also a Penn State University graduate.

According to his Linkedin account, Andrew MacMinnis works in the Marine Air and Ground Task Force as the Pacific's maritime contingency force. He was also involved in the humanitarian assistance and disaster relief effort following Japan following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.

When Aiden passed away earlier this year, the family asked that donations be made to 'Operation Purple Camp' at militaryfamily.org, or the Make-A-Wish Foundation for the Mid-Atlantic States, in lieu of flowers.

According to his Facebook page, Aiden had lived in Okinawa-shi, Okinawa, Japan.
