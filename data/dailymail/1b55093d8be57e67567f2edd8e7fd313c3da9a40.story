Venice authorities are investigating whether George Clooney broke the law by allegedly driving a gondola without a permit as he taxied himself to the watery city's film festival.

Arriving in his typical smooth style, the film star was pictured apparently at the helm of the boat, wearing sunglasses and a tee-shirt advertising his own brand of tequila.

People have turned a blind eye to the alleged illegal driving of the water-taxi - all bar one.

Under investigation: George Clooney is being investigated for allegedly driving a Venice water taxi without a permit

Authorities said checks will be made to establish of Clooney was in command of the taxi as he attended the city's films festival

Venetian lawyer Mario D'Elia has reported the incident to authorities demanding that police take action against the star, according to The Telegraph.

Piloting a city taxi in Venice requires a professional licence by law; Mr D'Elia has requested that Mr Clooney provides evidence he holds a licence, the paper said.

Photos of the film star in Venice, with co-stars of his latest film 'Gravity', appear to show Clooney stood at the front of a gondola, behind the wheel, more than once.

On one occasion he is wearing a grey tee-shirt with the logo of his own tequila on the front; in another he is wearing pale blue shirt with an open collar and a dark blue blazer.

The claim that he drove without a permit comes as the city deals with criticisms that its waterways are chaotic and dangerous.

If found to have been driving the taxi, the film star would be committing an administrative offence, in which case his taxi driver would be issued with a fine, an official said

Earlier this month, a German tourist was crushed and killed when the gondola he was travelling in collided with a vaporetto water taxi.

The city's famous wooden punting boats have since been banned from entering Venice's Grand Canal - a trunk waterway through the city.

Further investigation found the gondolier in command of the vessel tested positive for cocaine use, prompting a new regulation on drug and alcohol use to be rushed through as well.

The customary serenades that honeymooners have enjoyed for centuries will only be able to take place at night, according to the proposals, and vessel captains will no longer be allowed to use mobile phones while they are in control of a boat.

Exceptions for film stars were not mentioned in the new laws, however, so authorities are now looking into the claims that Clooney was at the helm without a permit.

If found to be true, the star of Syriana and Burn After Reading would get off lightly; his taxi driver, however, would face a fine.

Dressed up: The U.S. actors were also spotted dressed in black tie outfits in the water taxi

Sandra Bullock and George Clooney attended the premiere and opening ceremony of the Venice Film Festival together on Wednesday

Quoted in the Telegraph, a town hall official played down the hype, saying: 'Photos in the papers do not represent proof, so checks will be made.'

'But if an offence was committed it would be an administrative offence punishable with a fine. And if it came to that, it would be the taxi owner, not Clooney, who would be fined.'
