Ed Balls was heckled by union activists yesterday after supporting the Government’s decision to impose a pay freeze on state workers.

Speaking at the Trades Union Congress, the Shadow Chancellor faced shouts of ‘shame on you’ after admitting he would not reverse the freeze.

Later the TUC voted overwhelmingly to start planning the ‘practicalities’ of the first general strike in Britain since 1926.

Labour's Ed Balls told the TUC conference in Brighton that securing jobs was more important than big pay rises for the public sector

Mr Balls, who is a member of the two 
biggest unions, Unite and Unison, refused to support the clamour from 
the party’s union backers to reject the pay freeze.

Public sector workers who earn 
£21,000 or more are subject to a two-year freeze, while local government
workers are subject to a three-year freeze.

Official figures show the average 
public sector worker with a full-time job earns £28,668, compared with 
£24,787 in the private sector.

During a question-and-answer session 
at the annual conference in Brighton, the biggest cheer went to Liz 
Cameron, 49, a youth services worker from Salford, who criticised Mr 
Balls and Labour leader Ed Miliband for supporting the freeze, and spoke
of the daily struggle she faces to make ends meet. Mrs Cameron, who has
four children, said thousands of care workers, dinner ladies and 
teaching assistants were in a similar situation to her.

She said: ‘What is the response from 
our Labour Party? Why is it we hear you [Ed Balls] and Ed Miliband talk 
about supporting this Tory pay freeze when I’m having to make hardline 
decisions.

Unions are threatening more strike action in opposition to the government's spending cuts and job losses.

‘We are fighting to makes ends meet. 
No new school uniform, whether or not I can pay my heating bills, 
whether or not I can choose to buy food.

‘How on earth do you expect to get 
the support of hundreds of thousands of public service workers when you 
continue to repeat that position?’

But Mr Balls ignored her plea, 
insisting that the pay freeze is the only sensible option during the 
longest and deepest downturn for more than a century, prompting jeers 
from union members.

‘When you are losing hundreds of 
thousands of jobs, we can’t with credibility say the first priority is 
more pay for existing workers when hundreds of thousands of people are 
losing their jobs,’ he said. ‘That is the reality. I want things to be 
done in a fairer way but I don’t think we can argue pay before jobs. We 
have got to say jobs before pay.’

Mr Balls, who joked about his status 
as one of Britain’s most annoying MPs, also criticised the plans by 
unions to co-ordinate devastating strike action in the coming months.

He said: ‘I’m sure the last thing 
that the vast majority of trade union members want at times of such 
uncertainty in our economy is strikes. It is not what we want. It is not
what the public want.’

'We are at our best fighting back'

Steve Turner, executive policy director of Unite

Mr Balls added: ‘When Coalition 
ministers warn they will have to act and legislate if they are to see a 
return to the unrest of the 1980s what we are really seeing is Tories 
itching to provoke a row about strikes so they can blame the stalling 
recovery on trade union members and working people.’

But later, after a heated debate, 
union members cheered enthusiastically after controversially agreeing to
start plotting the logistics of a nationwide walkout in protest at 
spending cuts.

If it goes ahead, a general strike 
would wipe out vital services, with workers including teachers, prison 
guards, firemen,  nurses, dinner ladies and paramedics likely to walk 
out.

Yesterday’s vote is a huge 
embarrassment for Labour as the motion was supported by its biggest 
donor, Unite. Latest figures show that between April and June, Unite 
handed over £840,725, equal to more than a quarter of all the money the 
party received.

Steve Turner, executive policy 
director of Unite, insisted it would be ‘a betrayal of our 
responsibilities’ if unions did not support the strike plan.

‘We are at our best fighting back, roaring like lions, not cowering in corners,’ he said.
