The 19-year-old, who calls himself Abu Bakr, allegedly verbally assaulted, threatened and intimated a cleaner working at Bankstown Central shopping centre, in Sydney's west, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

Abu Bakr was arrested on August 10 after allegedly verbally assaulting a cleaner at Bankstown central shopping centre in Sydney's west

Bakr, a part-time labourer, was reportedly kicked out of the shopping centre by security but allegedly came back an hour-and-a-half later and further abused the man.

The incident is being treated as a religious 'hate crime' police sources told Fairfax.

On August 12 Bakr was featured in an SBS Insight show about Australians fighting in Syria.

He wore the Islamic State flag symbol on his black jacket and walked off set part-way through the show when his lawyer Zali Burrows and the show's producer became embroiled in an arguement.

Bakr, who was born in Australia but has an Italian and Iraqi background, is already on the radar of security services and has had his passport cancelled so he can not travel overseas.

Bakr thinks Muslims are obligated to help fellow Muslims overseas and reportedly does not feel connected with his home country of Australia.

Before the SBS TV discussion fronted by journalist Jenny Brockie aired Bakr's lawyer Burrows told Daily Mail Australia her client walked out because 'the whole set up was a farce and they duped guests as to the theme'.

'Then again perhaps we should not be worried as nobody watches SBS unless they are looking for soft porn on a Friday night.' she added.

Lawyer Zali Burrows said her client Bakr is 'a young kid who's passionate about injustice'

Burrows said she and Bakr were told the discussion would be about the new anti-terror laws announced by Prime Minister Tony Abbott last week.

Instead she said they spent two 'boring' hours talking about fighting in Syria and the Islamic State organisation.

'He was like a lamb brought to slaughter... he's a young kid who's passionate about injustice,' Burrows said of her client.

She did not comment when asked why Bakr's passport has been revoked.

Bakr was charged under his real name over the alleged shopping centre incident and will appear at Bankstown Local Court on September 10.
