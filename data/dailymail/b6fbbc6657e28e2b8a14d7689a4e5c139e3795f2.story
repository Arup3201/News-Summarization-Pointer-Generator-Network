They were supposed to be back in time for lunch, but six crew members of a gunship over Vietnam nearly 50 years ago were tragically killed in a crash - and their families are still looking for answers this Memorial Day.

Col Joseph Christiano of Rochester, 
N.Y.; Col Derrell B. Jeffords of Florence, South Carolina; Lt Col Dennis
L. Eilers of Cedar Rapids, Iowa; Chief Master Sgt. William K. Colwell 
of Glen Cove, New York; Chief Master Sgt Arden K. Hassenger of Lebanon, 
Oregon; and Chief Master Sgt Larry C. Thornton of Idaho Falls, Idaho, were killed when their plane went down on Christmas Eve 1965.

It would be decades before what was left of the crew aboard the plane known as Spooky 21 would be returned home.

Their charred remains
were found last year and identified through dental records, personal 
items and other circumstantial evidence.

All six were buried in a single casket 
with full military honors, as is common in situations where remains 
can't be conclusively linked to a specific individual.

The Air Force gave all six posthumous promotions, a military spokeswoman said.

Their job was a search-and-destroy mission on the Ho Chi Minh trail. Their target was a way station believed to be housing ammunition depots and anti-aircraft batteries, according to McClatchy.

But at one point, something went wrong. They were last heard from somewhere over the Vietnamese jungle when a distress call rang out: 'Mayday, Spooky 21. Mayday.'

They were never seen again.

It's unclear whether the plane had suffered a mechanical malfunction or was shot down by enemy forces.

For nearly half a century, the airmen's families endured an emotional kaleidoscope that they say is difficult to describe to those who never had to face it.

The men were listed for years as missing, and family members held out hope at first that their loved ones had survived.

For most that hope faded over time, despite an occasional unconfirmed report that crew members were seen alive.

The crash site has been excavated several times over the past decade, but it was not until 2010 and 2011 that human remains were recovered.

Even though Sherrie Hassenger's husband perhaps had the most conclusive identification of all six crew members - a tooth of Hassenger's was recovered and matched through dental records - she and her son Keith Hassenger said they still have nagging doubts about what happened.

Both said they appreciated Monday's service and were grateful so many people came to pay respects, but they said they have had a difficult time getting answers over the years.

The tooth, in their mind, raises more questions than answers: If a single tooth was found, they wonder, wouldn't it make sense that other teeth or perhaps his skull could be found also?

Keith Hassenger said that while they approached last year's burial service at Arlington National Cemetery with the feeling it might help provide closure, that comfort proved elusive.

'This may be the only thing we get,' he said.

For Jeanne Jeffords, 86, of Temecula, California, the hardest part of the service was seeing how emotional it was for her children, who were teenagers when their father died.

'I've lived with it for so long, I'm all teared out,' said Jeffords, who appreciated the opportunity to meet the families of her husband's fellow airmen. 'For all these years we just had a list of names.'

The service drew hundreds of people, including Air Force and Vietnam veterans unrelated to the families.

The first joint U.S.-Laotian team didn't visit the crash site until 1995 in the southern province of Savannahket, which was heavily bombed during the war as it lay on the Ho Chi Minh supply route that supplied Vietcong communist guerrillas in southern Vietnam.

A villager recalled seeing a two-propeller aircraft crash near the village. A second villager had found wreckage of it and took the team to the crash site.

Follow-up teams revisited the site four times between 1999 and 2001 and recovered military equipment but no human remains, and excavation was suspended.

Excavations resumed in 2010 and 2011, when human remains and personal items from the crew were found.

It is not uncommon in situations like these for joint sets of remains to buried at Arlington.

The Pentagon's Defense POW/Missing Personnel Office lists more than 83,000 service members as missing in action, the vast majority from World War II.

In 2011, the office identified the remains of 62 service members previously unaccounted for.

In an interview with the Associated Press last year, Jeffrey Christiano of Rochester, New York, who was only 2 when his father's plane went down, said Monday's burial brings his father home and resolves 'this nagging, disjointed feeling that he's not where he belongs.'

He said he has struggled to understand his own emotions in the months since learning that his father's remains had been found and would be buried at Arlington.
