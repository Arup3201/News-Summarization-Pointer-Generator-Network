Derek Tubby, 60, threatened terrified staff at his local Barclays branch, pictured arriving at court

A businessman who threatened bank staff with a makeshift flamethrower after his debit card was cancelled has walked free from court.

Shocked staff feared that Derek Tubby, 60, was about to set their building ablaze with his blowtorch and can of petrol after he stormed into the Barclays branch in Acle, near Great Yarmouth, Norfolk.

Norwich Crown Court heard Tubby claimed he had been treated 'unfairly' by the bank after a failed business venture left him £100,000 in debt.

The six staff and two customers in the bank fled through a back door before armed police surrounded the building on September 23.

Grey-haired Tubby of Rollesby, near Great Yarmouth, was tasered and hit with a baton when officers burst in and found him still holding the green plastic petrol can and blowtorch.

He admitted affray and was given a 12-month jail sentence suspended for 18 months and ordered to do 150 hours' unpaid work.

Judge Mark Lucraft QC also imposed a restraining order banning him from going into any branch of Barclays.

The judge told him: 'It is not, and cannot be right, to deal with anything in this way, whatever the grievance was.'

Prosecutor Richard White said Tubby had shouted at staff in a 'raised and aggressive voice'.

He added: 'He was saying that what the bank had done to him was criminal and said the bank had done it again and blocked his debit card.'

The bank manager tried to calm Tubby down by promising to look into his complaints, but he remained agitated.

The court heard how Tubby at first refused to allow the customers to leave as he wanted them to stay and hear what he had to say.

Mr White said one of the bank staff felt sick at the shock of what had happened, but a customer in the bank at the time had said he did not think Tubby would carry out any threat.

The court heard that Tubby received a caution in 2009 for going into a Barclays branch, in Lowestoft, Suffolk, with a crow bar and causing alarm.

Andrew Oliver, defending, said that Tubby had overreacted after having a difficult past four years and no longer banked with Barclays.

He tried to set up a children's nursery in Norwich for his daughter in 2009 but there was a problem over planning,

Tubby tried to get re-finance with the Alliance and Leicester bank, but found Barclays had taken power of attorney on his house and had his deeds to the property.

When he tried to get the deeds back, there was a delay in finding them.

Mr Oliver said: 'He had to pay £3,500 every three months for the rent of a building which was useless.'

He said the situation got so bad that the business had to be closed, which left him with significant debts of nearly £100,000.

The final straw came when his debit card was cancelled, causing him to fail to pay a VAT bill which made him liable for fines.

Tubby said after the hearing: 'A fair hearing in court witnessed how Barclays Bank had sadly controlled my family life. 'I felt that the public deserved the right to know how I have been treated.

Police at the scene: Bank staff said they thought that Mr Tubby would set the building on fire during the incident

'This forced me to express my opinions in an out-of character manner in order to be heard. I would finally like to draw a line under the long lasting grievances.'

A Barclays spokeswoman said the incident was 'a shock' for staff.
