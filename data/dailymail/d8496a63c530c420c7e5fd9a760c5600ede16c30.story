They say two is company, three's a crowd and four is a party.

But a new saying will have to be invented for mother-to-be Alexandra Kinova, who will give birth to five babies this weekend.

Ms Kinova, 23, revealed her huge bump to Czech media, showing just how much she has grown to accommodate her brood.

Maternal: Alexandra Kinova peers over her huge baby bump. She is just days away from delivery

Slim chances: Experts say the likelihood of naturally conceiving quintuplets is one in several million

Unknown quantity: The young mother was told she was carrying twins in January. Doctors then thought there were four babies in April

Revealed: Ms Kinova has been able to sleep on her side as her pregnancy has progressed

The quins have already made history as the Czech Republic's first ever set. The bumper brood are to be delivered by Caesarean section this Sunday.

Ms Kinova beat staggering odds to become pregnant with quintuplets without using IVF.

Ms Kinova, who already has one son, did not realise she was carrying five babies until last month.

At
 first doctors said she was having twins but in March staff at the 
Prague Institute for the Care of Mother and Child said she was actually 
pregnant with four childre.

However, it was not until the following month that she finally discovered she was having quintuplets.

Ms Kinova, from Milovice, about 30 km east of Prague, told Czech news site denik.cz that she was in shock when she was told.

Alexandra Kinova, 23, gave birth to four sons and a daughter by Caesarean section today

Surprise: The mother-of-one said she burst into tears when she doctors found a fifth baby

Hidden: Two of the unborn babies are hidden behind the front three

She said: 'When we finally found a fifth head, I started to cry.'

According to local media, her children will be the country's first set of quins.

The odds of conceiving quins naturally is one is several million, according to experts.

The mother said both she and her partner have a family history of twins.

Ms Kinova's birth went 'without complication' and she and her brood are in intensive care

She said aside from four months of morning sickness, she has had few complications in the pregnancy.

Ms Kinova said she has been able to sleep on her side and has not had any problems with her breathing.

And she said she plans to breastfeed all five, as she did with her first-born son.

She told denik: 'The first child I nursed for almost a year and a half and I want to breastfeed now.

'While I know that some will be on artificial nutrition.'

Ms Kinova said despite the best efforts of the doctors they still do not know the sex of all the babies.

Two of the unborn babies are hidden underneath the other three - two boys and a girl, who she plans to call Daniel, Michael and Tereza.

She said: 'I very much look forward to seeing how 
they will look. It's a great charm, but we cannot see anything properly -
 only a head or legs.'

The hospital will double the number of doctors and midwives for her Caesarean.

They said they have administered drugs to help speed up the development of the babies' lungs but they cannot be sure of their condition until they are born.

Dr Alena Měchurová, head of the hospital, said they hope that all five babies and the mother will be fine but said they cannot rule out complications.

One of the Garcia quintuplets born that weigh only 3 pounds each

The odds of conceiving quintuplets naturally is one in several million, according to Dr Wright Bates, from the University of Alabama.

He told ABC News that quins are 'exceedingly rare.'

Dr Bates said twins are born in up to one in every 100 births, while triplets are one in every 7,000 to 10,000 births.

Naturally conceived quadruplets are born in every one in 600,000 births.

The first recorded set of quintuplets known to have all survived were the Dionne sisters, who were born in Ontario, Canada.

Fewer than 10 sets of quintuplets are born every year in the United States.

Last month, Guillermina and Fernando Garcia had five babies – three girls and two boys – who weighed between 2 to 3 pounds each at the University of Utah hospital in Salt Lake City for another six weeks.

In 2010, British mother Vicky Lamb had four girls and two boys after taking a fertility drug but sadly one of the babies died.
