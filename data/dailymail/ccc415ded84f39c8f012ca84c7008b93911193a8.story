An Oklahoma police department wants drug users to know 'the dope man' is done dealing in their town.

Officers from the Warr Acres Police Department posted a note on the front door of the home of suspected drug peddler Aaron Phelps after they arrested him.

The message read: 'The Dope Man is Out Of Business. 

'If you have any questions contact Warr Acres Police 789-3329.'

The department was hoping to serve notice that drug use would not be tolerated in Warr Acres. 

According to neighbors, there were people coming and going from the 19-year-old's home 'at all hours of the day and night' and there was even a 'waiting line' outside the door at times. 

A search of the house turned up drug paraphernalia, a digital scale, a hand-drawn picture that said 'WEED,' and substances believed to be drugs, News 9 reported. 

The search also revealed sandwich bags labeled 'OG Green' and 'Crack'. 

Oklahoma County records show Phelps was charged with distributing a controlled dangerous substance, maintaining a place where a controlled dangerous substance was kept, possession of an offensive weapon while committing a felony and possession of drug paraphernalia, last month.

After the police department posted the sign on Twitter, people began commenting how funny it was 

One of Phelps' neighbors said the sign was 'kind of bad' but also 'hilarious,' KFOR reported. 

He wasn't the only one who found it funny. 

After the department posted a photo of the sign on Twitter - only the WAPD's third tweet ever - social media users began sharing and commenting about it. 

They tagged the post with: 'WAPD Criminal Investigations Unit shutting down another dope house in Warr Acres! #whosenext #wewontstop.' 

The Oklahoma County Sheriff's Office re-posted the image on Facebook. 

The sheriff's office then posted a picture of its own and incorporated some Valentine's Day humor.

The tweet the WAPD sent out with the image of the sign was only the third time the department had tweeted

Warr Acres Sergeant John Gray said that although some found the sign funny, the department 'didn't mean it as a joke' and takes the situation very seriously.

He said: 'We wanted the citizens to know that we're doing everything we can to make their neighborhood safer for them and for their children.

'If we have information that there's narcotics activity within our city limits, we will do everything we can to shut them down.'

Phelps is being held in the Oklahoma County Jail on a $15,500 dollar bond, according to reports.
