At least six ‘ghost ships’ packed with hundreds of migrants have been abandoned to their fate by traffickers in the Mediterranean during the past month, it emerged yesterday.

The Italian coastguard rescued 450 migrants yesterday – many of them women and children – who were on board the Ezadeen, a 50-year-old cargo ship designed to transport cattle. 

It came just 48 hours after six officials were dropped on to the deck of another ship, the Blue Sky M, packed with nearly 1,000 Syrians and Kurdish migrants that had been ‘locked’ on a crash course with the Italian coast.

Authorities believe the traffickers have adopted ‘a policy’ of packing old, barely seaworthy vessels with desperate migrants and leaving them to their fate by abandoning ship during the journey.

The ships – with their human cargo often cramped on deck in bitter cold and with few supplies – are fixed on a ‘crash course’ with the Italian coastline, their engines locked or simply allowed to drift towards land.

It is seen by the authorities in Italy as ruthlessly exploiting the cancellation of Operation Mare Nostrum, a search and rescue response to migrants, that has seen 100,000 rescued in the last year by Italian ships.

Previously, smaller quicker boats that could evade patrols were used but now with the number of searches reduced, larger older ships often written off as not being seaworthy are being employed by the smugglers.

The Sierra Leone-flagged, 240ft livestock carrier, Ezadeen was found drifting without power about 40 nautical miles off the southern Italian coast with 450 people on board, including several pregnant women. 

It had been put on a collision course for the Italian coast but ran out of fuel, officials said.

‘We know that it left from a Turkish port and was abandoned by its crew,’ coastguard spokesman Filippo Marini said. ‘When we hailed the ship to ask about its status, a migrant woman responded, saying, “We are alone and we have no one to help us”.’

For the Icelandic coastguard vessel, ICGV Tyr, which was leading the Ezadeen’s rescue, it was the fifth time it had been involved in the rescue of an abandoned vessel since it was deployed to the area at the beginning of December as part of a European replacement of Mare Nostrum. Italian coastguard officers were lifted on to the ship by helicopter and managed to pass a tow-rope to the crew of the ICGV Tyr. 

Engineers were also lowered by helicopter to ensure the Ezadeen was safely steered to port.

When the coastguard rescued 1,000 migrants on board the Blue Sky M it was believed the crew had left the Moldovan-registered ship, but it is now thought they may have tried to slip in to Italy by pretending they were migrants.

Four Syrians, aged 30-46, have been arrested after investigators intercepted Facebook and WhatsApp messages that they had allegedly used to arrange the voyage, sources told Italian newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano.

Two other alleged traffickers have also been identified but are yet to be arrested. Messages between the alleged crew dating back to December 15 show they always planned to impersonate fellow passengers before slipping away, investigators say.

The migrants made the reservations on Facebook then paid the equivalent of between £3,250 and £4,500 for the trip once they had arrived in Turkey, they told authorities.

The UN refugee agency says that last year 165,000 seaborne migrants had arrived in Italy by November 2014 and a further 40,000 in Greece. This compared with 60,000 for both Italy and Greece in 2013.

At least 4,000 have died this year in the waters off the coast of North Africa having been placed on overcrowded boats.

The war in Syria has meant the numbers fleeing for Europe have risen dramatically, overtaking the numbers of Afghans, Eritreans, Tunisians and other nationalities seeking a new start.

Both boatloads abandoned to their fate this week were made up of those fleeing Syria.
