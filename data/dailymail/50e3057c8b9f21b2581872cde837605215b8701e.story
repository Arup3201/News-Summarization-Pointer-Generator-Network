Katarina, the world’s loneliest orangutan, has been moved to a new zoo where, for the first time in her life, she will mix and play with other apes.

And those who have campaigned for her freedom after her plight was revealed by MailOnline last November hope that she will even find herself a boyfriend among her new companions.

Once the private pet of Malaysian royalty before she grew into adulthood, she was passed on to her first zoo where she was locked in a compound by day and a cage at night, living out a heartbreakingly-lonely existence.

Visitors to the Kuala Lipis zoo, 80 miles east of Kuala Lumpur, teased her by throwing junk food and pieces of rubbish at her and even tried to get her to smoke cigarettes that were tossed into her compound.

When I visited the zoo I was saddened to find Katarina, aged about 12, sitting at the top of a dead tree staring out across houses that were spreading into the nearby jungle, her natural habitat.

Wildlife activist Upreshpal Singh, director of the Friends of the Orangutans group who accompanied me to the zoo, said at the time: ‘Sadly, she thinks she’s the only orangutan in the world - apart from perhaps having a memory of her murdered mother.

‘And there is no doubt her mother was murdered because no-one would be able to take a baby from its mother without being savaged.

‘The mother had to have been killed, perhaps by villagers or people protecting palm oil plantations, and then we believe Katarina ended up as a pet with a member of one of Malaysia’s royal families.

‘Once she became too big to be kept as a pet, she was passed onto the zoo - and a new life of total loneliness began.

‘She doesn’t even know how to behave like an orangutan. She has shown no natural behaviours.’

Katarina had no bedding and was forced to sit on cold concrete every day for at least 12 hours after the zoo closed its doors at the end of visiting hours.

The forgotten ‘wild woman of Borneo’ - early explorers referred to orangutans as 'The Wild Men of Borneo' - came to the attention of Mr Singh, who in turn drew my attention to Katarina’s unhappy life.

‘I only need to look into her eyes and I can see the loneliness there,’ he said.

‘Where is the spark that I’ve seen in other orangutans? She sits around without a soul nearby because everything has had to be fenced off to try to stop people throwing stuff at her.

‘She’s been sitting in a tree, which has no leaves and stays there all day, doing nothing, because there has been no other orangutan for her to associate with and play with.

‘Katarina has been as miserable as sin and I’m determined to get her moved to a place where there are other orangutans and where she can be happy for the rest of her life.’

Now Mr Singh’s hopes have been realised - or almost. 

While he wanted her to be moved to a rehabilitation centre, he has had to accept that Katarina’s rehousing in another zoo is better than keeping her in the Lipis compound.

Malaysia’s Department of Wildlife and National Parks revealed today that Katarina was moved last Thursday to the Taiping Zoo and Night Safari in Perak, 130 miles north of Kuala Lumpur, where she is being quarantined before she will be introduced to the other orangutans at her new zoo.

The move came after Mr Singh and his organisation handed over a petition to several ministries, including the Prime Minister’s office, stressing the urgency to move the orangutan.

More than 14,000 people from around the world - many of whom were moved by MailOnline’s story - signed the petition begging for her to be moved to another zoo or sanctuary where she would be able to mix with other apes.

Within days of the petition being handed in to wildlife officials, Katarina was being moved to her new home.

The wildlife department has confirmed that Katarina’s new home was inspected last year and was found to be complying with regulations.

Once a special permit was approved, Katarina was moved to the Taiping Zoo where she will soon be introduced to her new friends, who are of the same species of orangutan.

‘It’s not an absolutely perfect result, but it’s much, much better than where she was,’ said Mr Singh.

‘We’re all hoping now that she will find happiness at last.’

Today it is estimated that only 50,000 orangutans remain in the wild on the Indonesian island of Sumatra and on Borneo, which is shared by Indonesia and Malaysia.

Their world is dying around them, as trees come down to make way for oil palm plantations and adult apes and babies are hacked to death by workers protecting the planted trees.

For those people, hungry orangutans are pests which must be destroyed.
