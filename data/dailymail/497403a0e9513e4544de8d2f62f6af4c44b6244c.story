A new monster species of snake measuring up to 20ft-long is slithering into Florida, wildlife experts say.

More than 30 Northern African pythons, also known as rock pythons, have been found in a suburban area west of Miami.

It's feared they could they could invade the area quickly if swift action isn't taken. In a bid to solve the problem, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission has hired an animal control expert to patrol the affected area.

Biologists worry that the northern African pythons could interact with their Burmese cousins who already thrive in large numbers in the Florida Everglades.

Last year, 141 Burmese pythons were removed from the National Park.

Both snake populations, which are non-venomous, likely originated from pets that either escaped or were illegally dumped by their owners.

Wildlife officials say the rock pythons captured so far have averaged 10ft in length.

Their range is currently limited to the suburbs where marshlands are divided by a highway, canals, strip malls and housing developments crowded with new homes.

They've been captured in canals and in open areas next to homes; some end up as road kill. 

One fatal dog attack by a rock python was confirmed in 2013. 

Warning signs: Flyers have been posted to alert residents of the neighborhood that the Northern African python has been spotted nearby

On Thursday, wildlife officials timed a monthly survey to coincide with cooler temperatures that drive cold-blooded snakes seeking warmth to bask in open, sunny areas like roads and levees. 

The wildlife commission also left fliers about the snakes on mailboxes in one neighborhood. 

Anyone who encounters either python species is encouraged to contact Miami-Dade Fire Rescue.
