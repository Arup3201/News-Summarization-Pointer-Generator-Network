Royal Bank of Scotland would be broken up into a good bank and a bad bank under radical plans to be considered by George Osborne.

Toxic loans which might never be repaid would be placed in the ‘bad’ arm while the profitable business could be sold off under proposals expected to be set out by a powerful commission of MPs and peers.

However, the Chancellor is understood to be ready to resist the idea, preferring to sell off the taxpayer-backed bank even if it means making a loss.

Split: A powerful commission of MPs and peers is reportedly planning to call for Royal Bank of Scotland to broken up into a good and bad bank

The Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards is set to back the idea of splitting RBS, according to the BBC.

The UK government owns 82 per cent of RBS, after the £66billion bailout in 2008 which also took a 39 per cent stake in Lloyds.

Mr Osborne is prepared to sell the Government’s at a loss in order to bring about the biggest privatisation in British history.

Allies hope the sell-off could come before the 2015 general election to give the public a chance to take a stake in the lenders.

A long-awaited report from the Commission was sent to its members in the last week and they have until Monday to read it through, with a final report due by the end of the month.

George Osborne has warned of 'very considerable obstacles' to the idea of splitting RBS

However, Mr Osborne has warned of ‘very considerable obstacles’ to the idea, which would involve spending up to £9billion in taxpayers’ money to buy up shares the government does not yet own.

However outgoing Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King has supported the idea of a break-up.

Former Tory chancellor Lord Lawson, who sits on the Commission, argued that nationalisation followed by a split would enable the Government to boost lending and re-privatise the ‘good’ bank more quickly.

And Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has asked whether the Government’s ‘lack of will to break up the banks’ was a ‘recipe for a repetition of the disasters of the last few years’.

RBS itself has claimed it is well on the road to recovery, despite reporting losses of £5.2 billion for 2012, driven by a £390 million settlement for rate-fixing, £1.1 billion provision for mis-selling and IT glitches.

Yesterday it emerged RBS shrunk its net lending by £1.6 billion from January to March this year, but has borrowed £750 million from the Funding for Lending scheme designed to boost loans to businesses.

RBS chairman Sir Philip Hampton said on presenting full-year results that the institution’s recovery would be ‘substantially complete’ by the middle of 2014, paving the way for its return to the private sector.

Supporters of a break-up see it as a way of freeing the bank from long-standing bad debts, which could help it to lend more to businesses and boost the economy.

The move is also said to be favoured by the commission as a way of increasing potential investor confidence in the ‘good’ part of the bank and increasing the chance of a successful reprivatisation.

The so-called ‘bad’ bank would be held on to by the Government, avoiding the need for a fire sale of the more toxic assets and allowing them to recover in value.

But the Treasury is reportedly considering the alternative of transferring the group’s troubled Ulster Bank operations to the Irish government in an effort to shore up RBS’s balance sheet.

The commission’s recommendation could potentially be watered down by the time of its final report, but if not, the Chancellor would face a difficult dilemma.

There has also been mounting speculation over the Government’s plans for Lloyds Banking Group after shares have recently risen above the 61.2p level at which the Government said it would break even on its 2008 bailout.

A Treasury spokesman said: 'The Government’s policy remains that RBS continues to become a stronger and safer bank that supports the British economy, which in time can be returned to full private ownership when it’s in the interests of the taxpayer to do so.

'As the Chancellor has said, we need functioning banks supporting the real economy instead of nursing their wounds, and we will set out the way ahead once the Parliamentary Banking Commission has completed its work.'
