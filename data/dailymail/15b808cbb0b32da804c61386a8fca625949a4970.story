Iconic images from the early days of photography - including portraits of Queen Victoria, and the first ever picture of a hippopotamus - are to be showcased in a new exhibition. 

Drawn by Light will open the archives of The Royal Photographic Society, home to one of the world's most important photography collections, many of which were gifted by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. 

Among the collection are pioneering images from the earliest days of the art form - including pictures of a young Victoria taken in 1856,  and a picture of a snoozing, smiling hippopotamus taken at London Zoo. 

Work from pioneers including Alice In Wonderland author Lewis Carroll, as well as modern artists including Don McCullin, Terry O'Neill and Martin Parr will also feature at the Science Museum, in South Kensington.

The archives of the Royal Photographic Society have been opened to the public offering a fascinating insight into the history of photography. The display includes one of the earliest albumen print photographs of Queen Victoria taken by Roger Fenton in about 1856. It shows Queen Victoria sat in profile in a chair, holding a letter in her lap. She and Prince Albert both took an enthusiastic interest in photography, and in 1853 they agreed to become patrons of the newly formed Photographic Society

The Hippopotamus at the Zoological Gardens, 1852, taken by Juan Carlos Maria Isidro, Count de Montizon de Borbon. The snoozing creature was pictured at London Zoo and is believed to be the first photograph of a hippo ever taken. The beast was kidnapped in August 1849 from the banks of the White Nile and sent over to Queen Victoria by the Egyptian Pasha and later became a much-loved celebrity of the time

Afghan Girl, Pakistan, 1984, by Steve McCurry, is perhaps one of the most iconic images of the collection. Sharbat Gula was pictured at Nasir Bagh refugee camp near Peshawar, in Pakistan, and became known as the Green-eyed Afghan girl and 'the First World's Third World Mona Lisa' - a symbol in the late twentieth century of strength and beauty in the face of hardship

Soldiers of the Sky, 1940, by Nickolas Muray. An early advertising image, thought to have been commissioned for American propaganda purposes, showing the role of women in the war effort. Muray was based in the States and was an early pioneer of colour photography 

Portrait of Christina, Lieutenant Colonel Mervyn O'Gorman, taken around 1913. The close-up portrait of O’Gorman’s daughter was dramatic and unusual for the time. It was taken on the beach at Lulworth Cove, Dorset, during a family holiday. Christina featured in much of O'Gorman's work. As well as his military career O'Gorman also had artistic interests and was known as somewhat of a dandy

Light and Shade in Leicester Square, 1896, Paul Martin, paints London in a magical light.  Paul Martin was one of the first photo journalists and used a hand-held camera for this image taken at night 

Fading Away, 1858, Henry Peach Robinson, shows a young girl on her deathbed, dying of consumption, and surrounded by her family. It is an example of combination printing, and five different negatives were used to make one complete print. The print was controversial when it was exhibited, with many believing death was not a suitable subject for photography

A member of the warden's service fitting a gas mask, 1944, a photograph by John Hinde. The picture was taken as part of an illustration for the book Citizens at War - showing the role that civilians had in defence. Born into a Quaker community, Hinde became a photographer for the civil defence forces instead of a soldier. He was one of the pioneers of early colour photography

A fire guard, pictured in 1944, by John Hinde. After the war, Hinde became well known for his series of postcards of 1950s Britain. From the late 1960s to the early 1970s, Hinde worked on  the Butlin Holiday Camps postcards

Audrey Hepburn, 1950, by Angus McBean. This was one of the earliest and most iconic images of Hepburn -  taken before she was a well-known film star, while she was a mere bit-part actress and a model. The image was used for advertising Crookes Lacto-Calamine  in Vogue magazine

Nude on Sand - Oceano, California, 1936, Edward Weston. Weston and his muse took the California sand dunes for this work, which had not been intended to be shot in the nude. But his model, Charis Wilson, who later became his wife, spontaneously took her clothes off and rolled down the sand dune - resulting in this iconic image 

Sepervivum Percarneum, 1922, Albert Renger-Patzsch.  Renger-Patzsch was a German photographer who made it his life's work to react against pictorialism, instead striving to create a faithful objective vision of the world. This piece was used in his book - The World is Beautfiul

Another image by John Hinde of a simple lettuce set against soil. Curator Colin Harding said it was included in the exhibition to demonstrate the breadth of subject matter that Hinde looked at in his colourful works

Moonrise, Hernandez, New Mexico, 1941, by Ansel Adams. Another iconic image,  taken late in the afternoon from a layby on Route 84.The photograph became so popular that Adams made over 1,300 photographic prints of it during his long career

Chimney, 1934, by Noel Griggs. This image was an unusual concept for audiences of the 1930s, taking for its subject an everyday object - a chimney

War photographer Larry Burrows on assignment in Vietnam. The photographer, who features in the exhibition, donated a set of prints to the society in 1970. Just one year later he was killed in a helicopter crash in the Vietnam war

The Two Ways of Life, 1857, by Oscar Rejlander, created a great stir in the 1850s. The image is made of many separate negatives, printed together to create a staged tableau. The picture is an allegory - look to the right, and the subjects are portraying thrift, industry, compassion. To the left can be seen those of indulgence, gluttony and sin. It caused controversy because of the nudity it included. But when Queen Victoria visited the exhibiton she and Prince Albert loved it so much she bought a print of it and gave it to Royal Collection

The Turkish Bath, 1986, Calum Colvin. The Scottish contemporary artist creates 3D installations, combining painting and sculpture, and then photographing the composition from one angle to achieve a separate piece
