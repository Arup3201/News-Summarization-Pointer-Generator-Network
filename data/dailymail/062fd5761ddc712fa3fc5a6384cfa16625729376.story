And so it was true, after all. When Manchester United chief executive Ed Woodward conceded, under questioning from reporters in Los Angeles this summer, that the ailing Premier League club were prepared to eclipse the British transfer record this summer, he meant it.

This week’s imminent acquisition of Angel di Maria will cost the club in the region of £60million, and more than £100m when £200,000-a-week wages over five years are added to the bill.

As a statement of intent by United, Woodward and new manager Louis van Gaal, it’s significant. Di Maria is a top player approaching his peak years and in persuading him to leave Real Madrid for a club with no Champions League football on offer, United and their much-criticised chief executive will feel they are pulling off a proper transfer.

Big statement: United are signing one of Real Madrid's best players and  last season's Champions League hero 

Creative: The winger should bring a new spark to Louis Van Gaal's side, which has been lacking this season

Whether Di Maria is what this United squad really needs remains to be seen. Nevertheless, the financial details of the transfer serve to indicate that, for once, United have been prepared to put their money where their mouth is and back their manager.

A heavily incentivised package that will net the 26-year-old just over £10m-a-year, it eclipses the money offered to him by mega-rich PSG and indeed the £6.3m-a-year after tax that his representatives told Manchester City they would take when they tried, without success, to draw them into bidding recently.

At United, the deal will put Di Maria second in the financial pecking order, behind Wayne Rooney and just ahead of Robin van Persie. Perhaps that’s right, given that Rooney is captain and Van Persie — for all his talents — is 31 and, unfortunately, rather injury-prone.

Van Gaal and Woodward must now only hope that this transfer works for both of them.

Certainly, Di Maria is a fine player. The rangy, free-striding forward was looked at by both Manchester clubs and Chelsea during his earlier years at Benfica. Then, he was considered a little physically immature, not a good fit for the Premier League.

In Spain, however, Di Maria has trained on. He was terrific last season and during the recent World Cup in Brazil he looked a thoroughbred, playing a significant part in Argentina’s path towards a final he was to miss through injury.

At United the question focuses on where he will fit into the Dutch boss’ 3-4-1-2 formation. It is difficult to see him as a wing back — he hasn’t played there before — which leads to the thought that he may be used as one of Van Gaal’s centre forwards. Maybe this is why Danny Welbeck has been told to find a new club.

Still number one: New United captain Wayne Rooney is the only man at the club to earn more than Di Maria

Stifled: There may be a worry that Adnan Januzaj's development may be blocked by the arrival of Di Maria

When the deal goes through, United will have spent around £100m on Di Maria and Juan Mata, who they took from Chelsea in January.

Many would argue that money would have been better thrown at a world-class holding midfield player. That, above all, is what this fragile United team appears to need. It may also be the case that his arrival could block the development of young Adnan Januzaj.

Nevertheless, United are close to delivering the stellar player fans have demanded since last season’s disappointing campaign.

His first engagement is likely to be at Burnley’s Turf Moor on Saturday lunchtime. We will all look forward to that.
