Public servants racked up £1.15billion on taxpayer-funded credit cards last year – a rise of more than £160million since David Cameron pledged to cut spending on them.

Figures reveal how high-ranking public- sector workers blew the money on expenses including five-star hotel stays, meals at fine restaurants and Apple iPads.

They are deeply embarrassing for the Prime Minister who, during his general election campaign, spoke of his outrage at ‘hideous waste’ and vowed to reduce the cost of the cards.

The Freedom of Information figures 
show that the total spent on the Government Procurement Cards rose from 
£987million in 2010 to £1.15billion in the last financial year.

The cards are issued to about 150,000 
high-ranking staff such as local authority workers, civil servants, 
quangocrats and BBC executives.

Among the expenses enjoyed by 
officials was a £2,285 stay at the Sherlock Holmes Hotel in London by 
civil servants from the Department of Health.

Home Office officials spent £1,694 on 
trips on the London Eye, while bureaucrats in the Office of Rail 
Regulation spent £2,433 on four Apple iPads.

The Department for the Environment, 
Food and Rural Affairs spent £777 on a ‘working lunch’ at Westminster’s 
elite Cinnamon Club Indian restaurant and £1,129 at the five-star Tribe 
Hotel in Nairobi.

Meanwhile, the Rural Payments Agency spent £837 on a ‘specialist chair’.

Earlier this year, the Public Accounts Committee warned of a ‘culture of complacency’ surrounding spending on the cards.

The Cabinet Office last night admitted
the spending had increased across the public sector, but insisted: ‘The
amount Whitehall departments spent on GPC fell from £322million in 
2010/11 to £290.5million last year.

‘By clamping down on waste, making procurement smarter and slashing the use of these cards, we’re saving the taxpayer millions.

‘We would of course expect to see local authorities follow our lead on this.’

Shadow Cabinet Office Minister Jon 
Trickett said: ‘The Government said it would cut waste and hasn’t – 
while making police, servicemen and nurses redundant.’
