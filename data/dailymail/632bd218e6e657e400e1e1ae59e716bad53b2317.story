Caught: Grant O'Connor was arrested on Friday after police dispatchers heard him talking about drugs

A man has been arrested after he accidentally called 911 while he was speaking about buying drugs.

Grant O'Connor, 25, had no idea he'd been on the phone to dispatchers as he and a female friend ate dinner at Don Pepe's Mexican Restaurant in Mount Pleasant, Tennessee until cops told him.

After O'Connor pocket-dialed police on Friday evening, they allegedly heard him talking about getting high and going to a drug dealer's house, WKRN reported.

Dispatchers were able to trace the call and locate him at the restaurant.

Officers arrived on the scene and saw the couple pulling out of the restaurant parking lot in the woman's car, and police stopped her vehicle as she had a broken tag light.

The officer searched the car and found a bag of marijuana and drug paraphernalia underneath O'Connor's seat.

The woman said she knew nothing about it and was not arrested. 

But O'Connor was charged with simple possession and possession of drug paraphernalia.

Mount Pleasant Police Chief Michael Hay said the arrest was down to O'Connor's 'really bad luck. And also some really good police work'.

The man was released on $3,500 bond the following day.
