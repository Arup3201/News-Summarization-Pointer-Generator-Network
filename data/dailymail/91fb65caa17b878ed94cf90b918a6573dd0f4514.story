Storms continued to batter Britain's coast yesterday as autumn arrived with a roar as forecasters warned the unsettled conditions could last for two weeks.

The crew of a stricken 120ft sailing boat were yesterday recovering on land after being when rescued their mast snapped off the south coast.

In Essex, Southend Pier was closed 
today to assess damaged caused by a contractors barge which repeatedly 
smashed into it overnight, while in Blackpool tourists ran for cover as a sandstorm battered the coastline.

The Met Office has confirmed that this week's unsettled weather looks set to continue into next week, with winds of up to 60 miles per hour battering parts of Britain.

Much of the country will see more cloudy and windy weather for the remainder of the week and temperatures in the mid to high teens, with an area of low pressure over the north of Scotland blamed for the foul conditions. 

Temperatures will climb out of the teens into the low 20Cs by the weekend in the south east, but continued gusts of wind means that it will feel cooler outdoors.

TONIGHT: Scattered showers continuing for most overnight with more persistent rain at times for northern and western parts of the UK. The far southeast staying mostly dry with clear spells. Windy.

TOMORROW: Blustery showers and sunny intervals, with showers turning heavy across Scotland and Northern Ireland. Driest and brightest across southern and eastern England. More persistent rain spreading form the west later

THURSDAY: Staying unsettled for most with further spells of rain or drizzle at times. Southeast England staying the driest and warmest. Winds strengthening again by Saturday.

News of the spell of bad weather comes as it was revealed that Eastbourne is Britain's sunniest street.

Burton Road in Eastbourne saw 1,934.5 hours of sunshine in 12 months - 42.8 per cent more than the 1,354.9 hour average.

The research was carried out by energy firm HomeSun in a bid to find out areas with the most suitable homes for solar power.

Michael Fish, who lives in 
Eastbourne, told the Daily Telegraph: 'The shelter of Beachy Head means 
that Eastbourne has a unique micro-climate that really is sunny all year
round.'

Met Office forecaster Dan Williams said: 'Certainly today it's wet and windy - very windy on exposed coasts, with the south and west coast seeing winds of 50 or 60 miles per hour.

'Looking forward, it's looking quite unsettled for the rest of the week as well, and into the start of next week.

'On Friday, although we are are going to maintain quite wet and unsettled conditions, temperatures will be quite warm. Friday and Saturday in the south east and south coast we could see temperatures as high as 23C.'

Asked about the rest of the month, Mr Williams said that we could expect to see more of the same, and that a north-south divide would emerge when it came to the weather.

Windy: The Hovercraft between the mainland and the Isle of Wight was cancelled when the winds became too high

He added: 'There's a clear north west-south east divide. North western Britain is looking unsettled with showers and even gales. For the south east, we'll see some rain but in general it's going to be drier and more settled with warm sunny spells at times.

'We're expecting this divide to continue for the next few weeks.'

Sixteen drenched sailors had to be rescued from a vintage ship after its mast snapped in two in near-gale force of the south coast.

The 120-year-old ketch, a training ship, was off the coast off Portland Bill, Dorset, when it was caught up in 40mph gusts and blown perilously around.

Its wooden 90ft tall mast broke in 
half in the force seven winds and the boom, sail and rigging plunged 
into the choppy 12ft seas.

The
crew of 16 on the stricken yacht, who were all young adults, were 
unable to retrieve the stricken mast in the poor conditions and called 
coastguards for help.

The Weymouth RNLI lifeboat rushed to the scene at around 5.35pm yesterday.

None of the sailors were injured in the incident, although some were suffering from seasickness in the rough conditions.

The lifeboat towed the stricken 100-ton wooden-hulled boat safely back into the harbour with the party remaining on board.

High winds also caused structural damage in places like Southend Pier, as trees were bent in the wind, while some came down altogether

The 105ft-long ship, called Leader, was originally built in 1892 and worked as a fishing trawler before becoming a sail training ship.

It is now one of four vessels used by the Trinity Sailing Trust, which is based in Brixham, Devon, to help disadvantaged young people learn to sail.

The vessel, which is on the National Register of Historic Ships, was sailing from Dartmouth to Weymouth as part of a training trip when the weather closed in 1.5 miles off Portland.

The powerful westerly winds snapped the tall wooden mast in half, leaving just a short splintered pole.

Andy Sargeant, coxsman of Weymouth lifeboat, said: 'The crew called Portland Coastguard reporting the vessel had dismasted and we launched the all-weather lifeboat.

'There was a force seven westerly wind and a 12ft swell so the weather conditions were difficult for them.

'By the time we got there, the crew had managed to lash the sail and rigging safely onto the port side of the vessel so they didn't bang and flap away.

'Nobody was injured, just a bit sea-sick and we towed it slowly back to Weymouth harbour.'

Damage: Southend Pier in Essex was closed today after sustaining damage from a barge in high winds

Struan Cooper, chairman of trustees at the Trinity Sailing Trust based in Brixham, said: 'We're not yet sure what the cause was, but the simple fact is that the main mast broke and went over the side.

'Not only the top part of the main mast but the top mast and the rigging went overboard as well.

'Fortunately most people on board were on the aft of the deck and nobody was hurt - not even a scratch.'

In a separate incident Southend Pier in Essex - the longest pleasure pier in the world - will be closed today to allow engineers to assess damage from a contractor's barge tethered to the pier.

A statement on Southend-on-Sea 
Borough Council's website said the barge was forced into the pier by 
high winds and a heavy swell.

A council spokeswoman said the vessel had been moored alongside the pier to carry out scheduled maintenance work.

'The pier is not about to fall down, or anything like that, but it has caused some damage,' she said.

'They are just finding out what needs to be done and that is why it has been closed as a precautionary measure.

'It has not damaged the integrity of the pier structure itself but there are some repairs that need to be done.'
