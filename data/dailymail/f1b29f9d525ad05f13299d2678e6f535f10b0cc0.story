The 32-year-old midfielder joins a lengthy list of absentees for Laurent Blanc's side including Serge Aurier, Marquinhos, Lucas Moura and Yohan Cabaye.

It is another concern for Blanc, who saw his side throw away a two-goal lead in the dying minutes at home to Caen in the league on Saturday after being forced down to nine men late on due to injuries.

PSG met Chelsea in the Champions League quarter-finals last season, with Jose Mourinho's men going through on away goals thanks to a last-minute Demba Ba strike at Stamford Bridge.

The Blues, meanwhile,  welcome back Diego Costa after his absence through domestic suspension.
