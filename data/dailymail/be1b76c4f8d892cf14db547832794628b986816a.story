Matt Lauer has responded to criticism for asking General Motors CEO Mary Barra if she can be both a good parent and a good executive by saying he'd have asked a male CEO the same question.

Barra was interviewed on Thursday's Today Show and replied she believes she can be a good parent and a good CEO.

Lauer took heat from dozens of Twitter contributors who said he wouldn't have questioned a male CEO like that. He insists he would have.

On-air exchange: Mrs Barra said she has the support needed to successfully balance her family and work life in response to Lauer's question, which he had drawn from a Forbes Magazine article

Lauer noted on his Facebook page Barra addressed the difficulty of balancing her work and home lives in a Forbes magazine article.

He said if a man in a high-level job had publicly discussed the issue he'd have 'asked him exactly the same thing.'

The 56-year-old TV presenter called work-life balance an important topic and said that as a married father of three he's familiar with it personally.

Lauer traveled to Detroit Thursday to interview Barra, the first female CEO of GM, a day after the embattled automaker announced the recall of another 33,000 cars due to possible air bag defects.

The wide-ranging interview addressed what so far has been a disastrous year for the automaker marked by a long series of recalls and the recent release of a damming report, which revealed that the company dragged its feet on critical safety issues.   

Lauer strikes back: The NBC [presenter wrote on Facebook that he would have asked a male CEO the same question had he made a statement about parenting

Mary Barra has been under fire ever since being appointed CEO earlier this year. Last week, she was called to testify for a second time before a House committee over GM's handing of the February recall of 2.6 million cars with defective ignition switches, which led to at least 13 deaths.

'A busy few days of travel from London to Detroit… I’m writing this update now from Denver. Thanks for all of the comments and feedback around our interview with GM CEO Mary Barra this morning.

I wanted to share some thoughts around one of the questions that has started an important conversation. As part of the interview, I referenced this Forbes article (http://www.forbes.com/sites/joannmuller/2014/05/28/exclusive-inside-mary-barras-urgent-mission-to-fix-gm/) where Barra talked about the challenge of balancing work life and home life.

She said, “My kids told me the one job they are going to hold me accountable for is mom.” She had just accepted the job as the first female CEO of a major American automotive company, and in the article she said that she felt horrible when she missed her son’s junior prom.

It’s an issue almost any parent including myself can relate to. If a man had publicly said something similar after accepting a high-level job, I would have asked him exactly the same thing.

A couple weeks ago, we did a series on “Modern Dads” and the challenges of fatherhood today. Work-life balance was one of our focuses.

It’s an important topic, one that I’m familiar with personally, and I hope we can continue the discussion. '

During the exclusive interview with Matt Lauer, Barra acknowledged that mistakes have been made and confirmed that several people had been fired from the company.

When asked about allegations of a cover-up within the company, the GM CEO noted that there were 'silos of information' available, but blamed staffers for failing to act on the information with a sense of urgency.

The recently hired CEO sounded a hopeful note, telling Lauer that she wanted GM to be a company that people can trust, and that the only way to do that was to remember their past mistakes.

In the second part of the interview, Mrs Barra, who began her career in GM 30 years ago on the assembly line, insisted that her being a woman had nothing to do with her becoming CEO.

‘I believe I was selected for this job based on my qualifications,’ she told Lauer after the journalist asked about a theory bandied about in the media that she had been chosen to provide a softer image for GM.

Lauer then brought up a recent statement made by Barra to Forbes Magazine about missing her son's junior prom: 'My kids told me the one job they are going to hold me accountable for is "Mom."'

The NBC presenter asked Barra if she can do both jobs well given the pressures of her new job.

In response, the head of GM stated: 'I think I can. I have a great team, we're on the right path. ... I have a wonderful family, a supportive husband and I'm pretty proud of the way my kids are supporting me in this.’

The exchange sparked a firestorm on social media and in the press, with critics lambasting Lauer for posing a question to Barra, GM's trailblazing female CEO, that he would not have posed to a man.

Center for American Progress President Neera Tanden tweeted: ‘My suggestion: Maybe working moms should stop watching @MLauer.’

Jugging act: Lauer, 56, who is married and has three children, said he is well-familiar with the topic of work-life balance

In a scathing opinion piece for the Detroit Free Press, columnist Tom Walsh wrote: ‘Would he ever contemplate asking Alan Mulally at Ford, or Sergio Marchionne at FiatChrysler, if they could be a good CEO and a good parent at the same time?’

Thursday afternoon, Mr Lauer took to his Facebook page and posted a lengthy statement addressing the allegations of sexism. 

He noted the question at the center of the controversy referenced Barra's own words quoted in the Forbes article.    

'If a man had publicly said something similar after accepting a high-level job, I would have asked him exactly the same thing,’ Lauer insisted.
