It has famously been said that when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life.

And now an online walking tour has launched a map that charts the scientific history of the fascinating city - taking in the sites where the most revolutionary scientific experiments were conducted.

The map covers five centuries of innovation, from alchemy to the exact site that the atomic bomb is thought to have been conceived.

Discoveries mapped: The map covers five centuries of innovation, from alchemy in Mortlake, suburban West London to the exact site that the atomic bomb is believed to have been conceived in Bloomsbury

It was created by San Francisco-based Stamen Design, using data from the Open Street Map.

In around 1550 in Mortlake, West London, the theological adviser to Queen Elizabeth I, John Dee reportedly communicated with an angel. He also tried to create the Philosopher's Stone, dabbled with the occult and published a number of mathematical theories.

U.S. Electricity pioneer Benjamin Franklin conducted many dangerous experiments at his lodgings in Craven Street on London's Embankment near the Thames.

The map says that it was there that he designed a lightning rod to minimise damage to buildings including St Paul's Cathedral, which earned him a Fellowship at the Royal Society in 1756.

Making medical history: At St Thomas’ Hospital on the South Bank (marked on the map left),
 renowned surgeon Astley Cooper (pictured right) manually closed off the aorta to prevent
 an aneurysm in 1817. While it was the first time the theory was put into practice, the patient dies just 40 hours after the operation

At St Thomas’ Hospital on the South Bank, renowned surgeon Astley Cooper manually closed off the aorta to prevent an aneurysm in 1817.

He cut into a dying man's abdomen without anaesthetic and found his aorta by feel alone, before tying it off in front of onlookers and saving the man's life - albeit for just 40 hours.

Kensington in West London was the setting for a couple of railway experiments.

In 1840 brothers Jacob and Joseph Samuda rented half a mile of the unopened West London Line and demonstrated the world's first atmospheric railway, which used differential air pressure to provide power for propulsion.

While the applications of the technology were short lived, their innovation preceded the opening of the London Underground two decades later, which used steam locomotives.

The site of an explosive idea: This peaceful park is the final stop of the walking tour. Leafy Russell Square in Bloomsbury was where the bomb that has changed the nature of war forever, was conceived by Leo Szilard when he was crossing the street in 1933

It was in a shed in Marylebone in North West London in 1823 that the 'father of the computer', Charles Babbage, invented his Difference Engine - a type of calculator. While the first one was never finished, his theory and the creation of the Difference Engine mark 2, led to the development of  other early computers.

The first television was demonstrated at 22 Frith Street, Soho when in 1926 John Logie Baird transmitted live images of his assistant and a ventriloquist’s dummy to 50 people. One year later, he sent pictures between London and Glasgow by telephone cable.

And on the final stop of the walking tour, the bomb that has changed the nature of war forever, was conceived by Leo Szilard when crossing the street in leafy Russell Square, Bloomsbury in 1933.

The Hungarian mathematics prodigy came up with the idea of the atomic bomb and 'as he crossed the street, time cracked open before him and he saw a way to the future, death into the world and all our woes - the shape of things to come,' his biographer, Richard Rhodes wrote.
