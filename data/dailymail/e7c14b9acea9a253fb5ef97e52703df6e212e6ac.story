Kim Watson, 32, has been charged with stealing and selling on goods worth $3.7million from Sears

A Sears clerk has been charged with stealing goods worth $3.7million from one of the department store's warehouses.

Kim Watson, 32, allegedly sold on the high-end merchandise after taking it from the Sears Distribution Center in Logan Township, New Jersey.

Watson, from Clementon, was arrested on Friday after a long-term investigation led detectives to believe the inventory clerk had been taking cash payments for the goods. 

The investigation, by Gloucester County Prosecutor's Office, found that everything from bedding to kitchen appliances had gone missing.

Police believe that the merchandise was sold to a network of people around the New York tri-state area, NJ.com reported.

The haul totaled roughly $3.7million at retail prices, meaning Sears had lost around $2.6million.

Watson was charged with second degree theft and was held at Salem County Jail in default of a $50,000 bail. 

Captain Robert Leash, from Logan police, said the investigation was ongoing.

He said: 'We are still looking into this. We know she had a network. She didn't do this alone, and these people knew they were receiving stolen goods.' 

Police say missing goods from the Sears (file picture) warehouse ranged from bedding to electrical equipment
