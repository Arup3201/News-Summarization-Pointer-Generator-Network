Kieran Trippier is hoping a good season with Burnley in the Premier League could earn him an England call-up.

The former Manchester City full-back is regarded as one of the Clarets' best players and has been included in the Championship team of the season for the last two years.

Trippier has played for England at every level from under-18s to under-21s and is hoping to impress manager Roy Hodgson.

He said: 'It's always been my ambition to play for England. I've played at a young age and it was an honour, I loved every minute of it.

'I'm playing in the Premier League now and I just want to do very well. I'm only 23 so I'm certainly not going to write it off. Hopefully I can catch the manager's eye and show what I can do, and hopefully I can get the nod.'

Impressive: Kieran Trippier has made the Championship team of the season two years running

Trippier was rumoured to be interesting Arsenal at the end of last season but he committed himself to Burnley by signing a three-year contract until 2017.

And the 23-year-old insisted leaving Turf Moor was never a consideration.

'It's been a good two seasons for me and all the lads,' he said. 'I'm just delighted that I did well in the Championship and I'll try to take it one step further.

'When the season finished I was speaking to the gaffer and I committed myself to the club. I never had any intention of leaving.

'Before the season ended I'd spoken to the gaffer and I was glad to finally get it signed early doors so I could just enjoy my summer and look forward to coming back.

'It's always been my dream to play in the Premier League and I'm just happy I'm doing it with Burnley.'

International: the 23-year-old admitted competition was tough but 'wouldn't rule out' an England call-up

The first matches Trippier looked for when the fixture list came out were Burnley's two clashes with City, the first of which is a trip to the Etihad on December 28.

The defender spent all of his youth career with the club but, despite captaining the FA Youth Cup-winning side in 2008, he never made a first-team appearance.

After two loan spells at Barnsley, he headed to Burnley on loan in July 2011 and signed a permanent deal the following January.

'It was a tough time because I was there from about eight,' he said of his City departure.

'When I came on loan to Burnley I still had about three years left at Man City but it was a choice that I made because I wanted to play games and I didn't want to be playing for the reserves any more.

'I've got a few people I still speak to there. I'll always try to keep in contact with them because they brought me through the ranks but there'll be no friends when I go back there.

Success: Few people thought Sean Dyche and Burnley would win promotion after selling Charlie Austin

'I don't think I have anything to prove to them, all I want to do is put the Burnley shirt on, go out there and do the best for me and the club.'

Burnley begin their second season of Premier League football with a home match against Chelsea a week on Monday.

Their first campaign ended in relegation in 2010 and they are odds-on to suffer the same fate again.

But Trippier is taking inspiration from Crystal Palace following their incredible revival under Tony Pulis last season as well as the manner in which Burnley defied expectations to reach the Premier League.

'Last season we were fourth favourites to get relegated and we got automatic promotion,' he said.

'This season obviously we're going to be written off but, if you look at Palace last season, they were written off by Christmas and they finished 11th.

'We're used to being written off but we've just got to get on with it and play to the best of our ability. We proved everyone wrong last season so who says we can't do that this season.'
