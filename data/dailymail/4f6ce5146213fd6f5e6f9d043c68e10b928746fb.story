Experts today named discount supermarket Aldi as the best place to buy wine with some of its £3.99 bottles judged better that ones being sold elsewhere for £45. 

The budget supermarket was named the new wine retailer of the year at the prestigious Drinks Retailing Awards, beating previous winner Waitrose, and top drinks merchant Majestic Wine.

The award, designed to celebrate the best wine merchants in the country, is the latest accolade Aldi has received for its wine range.

Last year  the retailer - which sells wine from just £2.99 a bottle - was handed 121 medals at international competitions.

These included Gold at the International Wine Challenge for its Caversham Cream Sherry, which costs £5.25. 

It was also given Gold at the Decanter World Wine Awards for The Exquisite Collection Plan de Dieu, which costs £6.49. It was one of only six Rhone reds in the world to receive a gold medal

Other awards included a Gold at the International Wine Challenge for The Exquisite Collection Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc (£7.99); the only dry sauvignon blanc to win.

And Aldi's Kooliburra Australian Shiraz Cabernet 2013 (£3.99) got a Silver award at the International Wine & Spirits Competition, beating a host of expensive bottles.

These included the Eileen Hardy Shiraz 2010, which typically retails at £45 - 11 times the price of the Aldi winner.

Beaten: Last year's winner Waitrose had its crown stolen - but won five awards including for cider and spirits

Aldi's history began in a small grocer's shop in the mining town of Essen in Germany opened in 1914 by Anna Albrecht, 

By 1948, her sons Karl and Theo had taken it to four other locations in the country, and in 1954, the first self-service shop was opened. 

The brothers had a falling out in 1960 over whether or not to sell cigarettes in stores, and the brand was split into Aldi Nord and Aldi Sud. 

In 1971, Theo Albrecht was kidnapped for 17 days and held to a ransom of $3million. The Albrecht family has remained notoriously private since.

Karl Albrecht is now in his nineties and was listed Germany's richest man by Forbes last year.  

The brand's name is a combination of the family's and the word discount.  

After branches were opened in America, the first store in Britain welcomed shoppers in 1990. It now has more than 500 across the world. 

The panel of experts crowned Aldi best retailer at an awards ceremony in London last night.

Tony Baines, MD Buying at Aldi, said: 'We're thrilled to receive this fantastic award. It's a real testament to the excellent quality wines our talented team work tirelessly to deliver.

'Our close relationships with some of the best suppliers from around the world enable us to bring the best quality wines to our customers, whether they cost £3 or £10'. 

It stocks wines costing between £2.99 and £9.99, with more expensive, 'premium wines' introduced at Christmas. 

It was not all bad news for Waitrose, however - as the upmarket retailer managed to win five other awards compared to Aldi's one.

While Aldi scooped the gong for wine, Waitrose won prizes for cider, spirits and champagne.

It was also named supermarket of the year and online retailer of the year.

It came as an influential report found class and snobbery are no longer a barrier for middle-class families when it comes to shopping at budget stores.

A study shows 45 per cent of wealthy households have stopped at Aldi or Lidl in the past three months – exactly the same percentage as for lower income families.

While the budget chains have made their name by selling household essentials at low prices, they have also made a concerted move to attract the wealthy with upmarket food and drink offerings.

Tim Wilson, of the Wilson Drinks Report, which carried out the survey, said: 'Any perceived embarrassment at being seen shopping at the discounters has now gone.'
