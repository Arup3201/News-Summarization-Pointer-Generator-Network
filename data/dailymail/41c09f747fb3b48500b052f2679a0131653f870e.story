Pablo Zabaleta is a footballer not afraid of showing his emotion on the pitch - as he perfectly showed at the end of a draining World Cup semi final that saw his Argentina side beat Holland on penalties.

The Manchester City right back was out on the pitch celebrating his country's advancement to the final in a bright blue wig despite sporting a bandage on his face after a nasty cut sustained during the game.

And he went on to pose a selfie, complete with his two new latest accessories, from Argentina's dressing room as the celebrations continued behind closed doors.

The 29-year-old played a starring role, putting the brakes on Arjen Robben on the wing as Argentina kept a four shutout of the tournament - and their third in a row in the knockout stages.

While Lionel Messi has been leading the line up front, the work of Zabaleta and his defensive team mates has often gone unnoticed, but it was obvious his team mates appreciated all of his good work as they embraced after Maxi Rodriguez's winning penalty.

Now Zabaleta has the chance to top off a successful season with City with the ultimate prize - the World Cup trophy could be lifted on enemy soil in the Maracana on Sunday.
