Usually city girls wouldn't be seen dead in a pair of wellington boots unless they were glamping at Glastonbury.But thanks to the soggiest summer the UK has seen for years, wellies have broken out from farms and festivals to become must-have summer footwear, as stocks of flip-flips and sandals have been replaced on the high street by wellington boots in every colour, size and style.Value retailer Shoe Zone has seen a storming increase in the sales of rubber boots since the start of the ‘summer’ season, selling 115,000 pairs since the start of May, with 23,000 pairs now sold every week – that’s two pairs of men’s, women’s or children’s boots sold every minute.

Forget festivals: Now trendy city girls are wearing wellies to work

No mud in sight: The new way to wear wellies as seen on Millie Mackintosh posing with her boyfriend Professor Green at a dry Wireless festival

And sales are up almost 100% at department store Debenhams

Natelle Baddeley, Head of Footwear &
Accessories Design at says: 'We have seen unprecedented demand for 
closed footwear, and some of our fastest selling lines are new ankle boots 
which normally would not appear on our best sellers for at least another
month.

'In particular we have seen sales of wellies go through the roof 
as a direct result of the bad weather.

'For this month alone, sales of brollies have been
up 178% on last year, and wellies up 99% on last year.

'The numbers usually peak at festival times and our fashion wellies sell
very well throughout this period, but these current levels are very 
unusual. This is clearly down to the bad weather, having had the wettest
June on record and July looking to follow suit'

Palace vs party: The Duchess of Cambridge and Kate Moss are both huge welly fans and have inspired welly-wearing in their own unique styles

Naomi Shefford, Marketing Director at
Shoe Zone adds: “The cold and damp summer has not been ideal for 
retailers and it’s a shame high summer lines are still sitting on the 
shelves.

City slicker: Manhattan girl Sarah Jessica Parker is often seen out in wellies

'Sales have been driven by muddy festivals, but it seems more and more people are wearing them every day now too.'

Indeed, wellies are fast becoming every day wear for even the most glamorous girls.

New research by online fashion site 
very.co.uk shows that women are wearing the waterproof boots more often 
than they are sporting trainers, wedges or sandals this summer.

Damp
skies are of course the main drive behind the change in footwear 
fashions, but the celebrity influence of stars like Sarah Jessica Parker, Kate 
Moss and Keira Knightley wearing rubber rain boots as part of trendy 
day-time outfits is helping give wellies a glossy new image.

57% of women surveyed said that they are now happy to wear wellies on their 
morning commutes to work and 68% said there’s absolutely no shame 
whatsoever in stepping out in the city in a pair.

Travel website style-passport.com has 
also seen a big increase in sales of smart wellies to stylish city slickers.

Editor of the site Sophie McElligott says:'Sales
of wellies have exceeded all expectations this summer and we are
replenishing our Hunter stocks all of the time (another best-seller is
the Rainwave mac which sells out as soon as they arrive on the site).

'With
festival figures down this year from last, we know that the rain has 
put people off outdoor camping and glamping but are seeing a big 
increase in the acceptability of wearing our much loved rubber boots in 
urban areas.

'We think this 
demonstrates the brilliant, effortless style of the British woman - even
if it's raining and grey it's all about a pretty dress and a pair of 
wellies and that’s the quintessentially British combination of charming 
optimism and practicality.'
