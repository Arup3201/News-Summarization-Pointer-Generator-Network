A convicted sex offender groped a nine-year-old girl in front of her family in Hamley's toy store just days before Christmas, a court has heard.

Peter Grant of Swadlincote, Derbyshire, admitted being in the famous shop on London's Regent Street on December 22 and touching the girl while she played with remote control cars with her brother.

The girl's grandmother then saw Grant and confronted him before he was arrested by police.

According to the Mirror, when police searched the scene, officers found a biro pen concealing a USB stick, which it is suspected could be used as a recording device.

They add that other equipment including a laptop were found in the 61-year-old's hotel room near Heathrow Airport.

Westminster Magistrates Court also heard that the computer equipment is being tested to see if it was being used to record images.

According to the Telegraph, Grant has previous convictions for indecent assault and making indecent images.

He told Grant: 'This is a most serious offence where it is suggested you have targeted these premises and a child.' 

The case has now been adjourned until January 9 for pre-sentencing reports.
