A man has been caught on video throwing himself from a 65ft cliff and landing painfully on his stomach in the water - just inches from the jagged rocks below.

The thrill-seeker was caught on video hurling himself into the water below a harbour wall in Plymouth, Devon - at the same spot where one victim has already been paralysed in a similar stunt.

The footage shows the man soaring chest-first through the air before hitting the water face down just a few feet from the stones.

A second man looks poised to jump from the same concrete ledge - but decides against it after wincing at the huge crash his friend makes as he slams into the sea.

The video was filmed by bystanders along Plymouth Hoe in Devon, with one shouting 'oh my god' and another heard to say: 'That one's going to die'.

Dizzying: The man takes a run-up and throws himself from the harbour wall, with the rocks looming 65ft below him...

... and crashes into the sea flat on his belly, barely clearing the rocks below. Police have warned about the dangers of high-risk plunges into the sea

It was posted on YouTube and is of the tombstoning craze - the fast-growing craze for jumping into water from cliffs, piers and other structures.

The name is said to come from the aim of entering the water upright and straight, like a tombstone, but has become a more general term for all high-risk plunges.

The man leapt from the harbour wall just yards from where a teen tombstoner was left paralysed and wheelchair-bound in 2010.

Ben Thompson, 17, broke his neck after leaping off an 8ft ledge but landing on rocks.

Police, MPs and Coastguards have all warned teenagers about the dangers of tombstoning off cliffs, piers and other structures.

It is not illegal but Devon and Cornwall Police have branded it a 'potentially lethal pursuit.'

Ben Thompson from Plymouth, Devon, who was left paralysed after breaking his neck. He will spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair because of one leap from Plymouth Hoe into shallow waters. Right, a montage taken last year shows the stages of the terrifying craze of jumping 65ft off the sea wall into 'Dead Man's Cove'

The force issued a warning saying: 'This is a reckless activity and even in calmer waters it can be extremely dangerous.

'We, along with the Coastguard, are trying to deter young people from this potentially lethal pursuit and we strongly advise against it.

'It may seem like fun but people are gambling with their lives against the power of the sea by jumping into unknown waters.

'It is unfortunately the case that if they carry on they are likely to end up with serious, life-changing injury or even death. This risk-taking behaviour is just not worth it.'

The UK's first known fatality was Stephen Royston, 24, who jumped 100ft into a water-filled quarry at Kit Hill, Cornwall, in 2003.
