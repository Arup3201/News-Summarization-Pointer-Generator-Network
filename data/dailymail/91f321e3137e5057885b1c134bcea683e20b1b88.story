President Barack Obama lent his support to a movement to implement mandatory voting in the United States on Wednesday, saying it could prove to be a short-term solution to the excessive amount of money that's now spent on elections in the country. 

'It would be transformative if everybody voted. That would counteract money more than anything,' Obama told a group of Cleveland, Ohio, residents. 'If everybody voted, then, it would completely change the political map in this country.'

Attorney General Eric Holder has openly endorsed automatic voter registration, adopted two days ago by Oregon, the first American state to officially embrace the measure, but Obama had not made his support for either that or compulsory voting clearly known until today.

The president said the people in America who 'tend not to vote' are usually younger, of lower income and skew toward 'immigrant groups' and minority groups. 

'And they're often the folks who are scratchin' and climbin' to get into the middle class,' he said, 'and they're working hard.'

'There's a reason why some folks try to keep them away from the polls,' he said. 'We should wanna get them into the polls.'

The remark as a subtle reference to Republican efforts at the state level to pass legislation that would require registered voters to prove that they are who they say that they are at the polls with a government-issued photo identification card.

Republicans say that such measures prevent voter fraud. Democrats claim that they stop legitimate voters from exercising their constitutional right to participate in the electoral process. 

Many Democrats believe that's the point of the laws - to keep groups that traditionally vote Democrat, especially minorities, from casting a ballot - and have characterized voter ID laws as racist for that reason.

Requiring the elderly, who sometimes don't drive, and minorities, who when they live in major cities often take public transportation, as well as the low-income sector of society, which can't afford always afford government identification cards, is a modern day poll tax, Democrats have argued. 

Supporters of the photo ID laws have tried to assuage their concerns by setting aside funds for government-funded ids and offering free rides to the DMV in certain states.

Obama's Department of Justice has taken many of the states that have passed such laws to court, with the notable exception of Virginia, which put in place processes to counteract the hardship that the new requirement places on certain individuals.

Conservatives are opposed to mandatory voting and automatic registration for many of the same reasons they believe states should adopt stricter regulations at the polls.

In Oregon, also the first state in the U.S.to conduct its elections entirely by mail-in ballot, Republicans worry that the mass distribution of millions of ballots by mail, which can easily be tampered with in residential areas, creates an opening for new instances of voter fraud.

Millions of ballots will be sent out and the state has little control over where they end up.

The cost of implementing the law is also of concern, as the system will ensure that every Oregon resident receives a ballot unless they opt-out.

There's also the question of where the DMV can ensure that the personal information it will use to pre-register voters and contact them will remain private. 

Automatic registration is popular in foreign countries, including Sweden, Argentina and Canada, where it has helped bring the voter participation rate up above 90 percent but remains controversial domestically.

Comparatively, just over half the U.S. population regularly votes. Roughly 56 percent of eligible Americans cast ballots in the 2012 presidential election. 

Australia, which enforces mandatory voting, has a 100 percent rate of participation. 

President Barack Obama tours Magnet at Cleveland State University before his speech on Wednesday afternoon. Obama brought up the topic of compulsory voting while giving a long-winded response to an audience member's question about what can be done to resolve the 'dysfunction' in Washington and lead to overturn of the Citizens United Supreme Court decision that allowed a freer flow of money in politics

Speaking at the The City Club of Cleveland today, Obama brought the subject up on his own while giving a long-winded response to an audience member's question about what can be done to resolve the 'dysfunction' in Washington and lead to overturn of the Citizens United Supreme Court decision that allowed a freer flow of money in politics.

'I don't think I've ever said this publicly, but I'm going to say it now,' Obama said, before bringing up compulsory voting.

'We shouldn't be making it hard to vote, we should be making it easier to vote,' he said.

Recalling his recent speech in Selma for the 50th anniversary of 'Bloody Sunday,' Obama said his Justice Department is 'vigorously' enforcing rights.

'The notion that this day and age we would deliberately be trying to restrict the franchise makes no sense,' he said, indirectly knocking conservatives. 

'In Australia and some other countries there's mandatory voting,' the president, a trained Constitutional lawyer, added, saying moments later that it 'may end up being a better strategy in the short-term' to dealing with franchise issues.

He followed up the remark by saying that 'long-term I think it would be fun to have a constitutional amendment process about... how our financial system works.'

After the smattering of applause died down, he said that realistically, though, that would be a long-term proposition.

Minutes before, in response to the man's original question, Obama had said he thinks the 'almost unlimited' amount of money that is spent on American political campaigns is, in his opinion 'bad for our democracy.' 

'And I speak as somebody who has raised a lot of money,' he said, humble bragging. 'I'm very good at it.'

Obama said he was 'proud' of the fact that his presidential campaigns 'refined' the use of the Internet for small-dollar donations.

'But I also got checks from wealthy people, too,' he noted.

'So its not that I'm not good at it,' he said, reassuring the audience. 'I just dont think its a good way for our democracy to work.'

Continuing, Obama said the campaign finance system makes Members of Congress 'miserable,' especially those that are in competitive districts, because they constantly have to raise money. 

It also affects legislation, he said, positing that there's a reason why lobbyists 'have undue influence' in Washington.

And most of the money politicians raise goes toward television ads, he said, which leads to an over-saturated market near major elections.

'And the nature of just the blitzkrieg, you guys here in Ohio, you just feel it, right?' he said, making reference to Ohio's status as a decision-making presidential state and therefore a target for TV ads. 

'I mean its just every election season, you've gotta turn off the TV. It's just depressing.'

Furthermore, most of the ads are negative because science shows that's more effective than feel-good messages when it comes to political campaigns.

And 'it just degrades our democracy,' Obama stated, before moving onto another aspect of the problem.
