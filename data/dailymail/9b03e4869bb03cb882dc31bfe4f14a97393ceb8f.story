These incredible pictures give an impression of how human life must appear to birds soaring overhead.

Appearing as so many brightly coloured ants below, people mill around at work and at play, apparently oblivious to the watchful eyes overhead.

The remarkable images were shot at locations all over the world by renowned British aerial photographer Jason Hawkes.

For more than two decades Mr Hawkes has specialised in photography from the air, organising all the logistics including helicopters, production and necessary permits.

Mr Hawkes said he enjoys shooting from above because it enables him to show locations from an unfamiliar perspective, drawing out the patterns of human life invisible from ground level.

'I find it more interesting to shoot abstract, art formed images of things that are natural or man made which you don't know are there until you happen to fly over them,' he says.
