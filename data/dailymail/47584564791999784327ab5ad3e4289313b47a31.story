A devoted mother-of-four who lost her battle with cervical cancer has left her family a moving 20-point plan of how to live a happy life after her death.

Annmarie James-Thomas hand-wrote the poignant life guide shortly before she died in March aged 44.

Her heartbroken husband Geraint revealed the contents of the note on what would have been his wife’s 45th birthday.

Her words of advice included: 'The happiness you feel is in direct proportion to the love you give' and 'worrying is wasted time - use the same energy to do something about whatever is worrying you.'

Annemarie was diagnosed with cancer two years ago but refused to let the disease conquer her optimism and even wrote a book called Humour with a Tumour.

She and Geraint, 47, initially kept the news from their four sons, Zack, 22, Harrison, 18, Harvey, 16, and Roddy, 13, and tried to carry on with life as normally as possible.

Annemarie, of Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, rejected the purely medical route and travelled to America in search of other ways to combat her tumour. She later returned for more conventional treatment at a specialist hospital in Cardiff.

Earlier this year, realising she did not have long to live, she began writing her life plan for family and friends.

Before she died in March, Annmarie wrote:
'I am so thankful for everything in my life. I like the person I am. I 
am thankful for my husband who is also on this journey. As one you can 
achieve most things, as two we can achieve anything.

AnnMarie and Geraint had four chidldren together: Zack, 22, Harrison, 18, Harvey, 16, and Roddy, 13. In her parting note, she said: 'To be blessed with one child is truly amazing, but to be chosen by four of the most beautiful spirits is a miracle and the best blessing anyone can hope for'

'Being diagnosed with cancer isn’t something that you can just shrug off, but it doesn’t have to define you either', she said. Pictured on her wedding day with husband Geraint

'I am thankful for my children - how much they have enriched my life. I’m sure I would have been a different person without them.

'To be blessed with one child is truly amazing, but to be chosen by four of the most beautiful spirits is a miracle and the best blessing anyone can hope for. I am honoured to know them.'

Annemarie also told about her cancer fight and the support she had from Geraint.

She said: 'We have been positive 
throughout, Geraint and me. There’s no denying that facing this has been
hard, and sometimes frightening.

'Being diagnosed with cancer isn’t something that you can just shrug off, but it doesn’t have to define you either.

'And whenever one of us has had a wobble the other has been able to keep us on course .

'Together we’ve done the same for our friends and family and in return they have done the same with me.'

Geraint, who builds children’s playgrounds for a living, yesterday paid tribute to his wife’s courage in fighting the disease her own way.

He said: 'There was no way Annmarie would ever want her cancer to take over her life and that is what conventional medicine would have done.

'She had watched cancer take both her father and mine and she was determined not to go the same way, where the treatment was not much better than the disease itself.

'She loved life and wanted to enjoy all of it for as long as she possibly could.

'I always felt she would be able to bounce back - if not stronger than before, then at least as strong as she could under the circumstances.

'That was down to Annmarie herself, her incredible sense of humour, indomitable spirit and the never-say-die attitude never left her.'

1. What you put out comes back all the time - no matter what.

2. You define your own script. Don’t let others write your script for you.

3. Whatever someone did to you in the past has no power over the present. Only if you give it power.

4. When people show you who they are, believe them the first time.

5. Worrying is wasted time. Use the same energy for doing something about whatever worries you.

6. Whatever you believe has more power than what you dream or wish or hope for. You become

what you believe.

7. If the only prayer you ever say is ‘Thank you’ then that will be enough.

8. The happiness you feel is in direct proportion to the love you give.

9. Failure is a signpost to turn you in another direction.

10. If you make a choice that goes against what everyone else thinks, the world will not fall apart.

11. Trust your instincts. Intuition doesn’t lie.

12. Love yourself and then learn to extend that love to others in every encounter.

13. Let passion drive your profession.

14. Love doesn’t hurt. It feels really good.

15. Every day brings a chance to start over.

16. Doubt means “don’t”. Don’t answer. Don’t rush forward.

17. When you don’t know what to do, be still. The answer will come.

18. Trouble doesn’t last always.

19. This too shall pass.

20. I will act with the intent to be true to myself
