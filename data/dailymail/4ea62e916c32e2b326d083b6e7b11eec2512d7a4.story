The poll was carried out by breastfeeding experts Lansinoh who surveyed over 2000 mums in the UK and over 13,000 worldwide.

Their healthcare associate Katie Hilton, who is also a midwife, nurse and mother-of-one, believes Holly, 33, won because UK mothers can relate to her.

She said: 'The survey results suggest that mums in the UK relate to down-to-earth celebrity mothers over glamourous, Hollywood celebrities. 

'Her role on This Morning means that Holly Willoughby is somebody that mums wake up with in the morning when we are getting the kids ready for school or nursery. 

'She comes across as very grounded and unpretentious and mums like to talk to other women that they can relate to.' 

Holly recently welcomed a third child with her husband TV producer Daniel Baldwin.

Upon his arrival in September she tweeted, 'I'm sooo happy to tell you all - we've just had a baby boy! Chester William Baldwin made a grand entrance at 8lbs 12. He's just perfect. (sic).'

She also has Harry, five and a daughter named Belle, three.

As well as being carried out in the UK, the survey was put to women from other countries across the globe including Brazil, China, France, Germany, Hungary, Mexico, Turkey and the USA.

Angelina topped the poll in seven out of the nine countries but she did not win the ultimate role model title in her home country the USA. 

It was actress Jennifer Garner who took the accolade with 26 per cent of the votes, closely followed by Jessica Alba who came in with 23 per cent. 

Jennifer, 42, has three children with actor Ben Affleck who she married in 2005.

The Duchess of Cambridge appeared in the top three in France, Germany the USA and the UK.
