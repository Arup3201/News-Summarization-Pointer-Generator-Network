Nearly 40 government agents raided the home of popular online gun enthusiast Kyle Myers, 26, well known for shooting and blowing up inanimate objects on his YouTube channel FPS Russia.

The armed authorities with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and state and county law enforcement agencies showed up at Myers' home office in Carnesville, Georgia, as well as his father's home in Lavonia on Tuesday, three months after the unexplained death of Myers' business partner, Keith Ratliff.

The agents were hunting for explosives like the ones featured in Myers' YouTube videos, which they believe the Internet celebrity was using as a sales platform.

Raid: Nearly 40 government agents on Tuesday raided the home of popular YouTube gun enthusiast Kyle Myers, 26, well known for shooting and blowing up inanimate objects on video

Possible violation: The agents went to Myer's home office in Carnesville, Georgia, to find explosives that might be in violation of federal law, ATF spokesman Richard Coes said

ATF spokesman Richard Coes told the Athens Banner-Herald that Myers could be in violation of federal law for making money via YouTube for his lively display of explosives at use.

Coes noted that if a person is going to sell, distribute or use explosives for business purposes, they need a federal explosives manufacturing license.

He told the Banner-Herald that no arrests were made during the raids that took place at Myers’ home and his father's 60-acre ranch.

No firearms were reportedly seized, but Coes said he was unsure if any explosives were taken from either property.

There is an ongoing investigation 
into the death of Myers’ business partner Ratliff, 32, who was found 
with a single bullet wound to the head at his business office in 
Carnesville, where he lived, on January 3.

His
corpse was reportedly surrounded by several guns, but not the gun that 
killed him, according to news reports at the time of his death.

Entreprenuer: Mr Ratliff had recently moved from Kentucky to Carnesville, a city of 540 people, where he opened his business, FPS Industries, which made and repaired firearms

Ratliff, who had worked with Myers to create videos for FPS Russia, was reportedly last seen alive at 7 pm on January 2.

The online video producer had 
recently moved from Kentucky to Carnesville, a city of 540 people, where
he opened his business, FPS Industries, which made and repaired 
firearms.

He was licensed by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, authorities said.

Neighbors in Carnesville told reporters that the Kentucky-bred gun enthusiast kept to himself.

Prior to his death, a local sheriff said he was called to Ratliff's property only once, after neighbors reportedly heard gunfire.

The investigation into the FPS co-founder's death has widened into other states, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation told the Banner-Herald on Wednesday.

The GBI would not comment on suspects or persons of interest in the case.

The FPS videos, which star Myers often speaking in a fake Russian accent, became popular 
for their distinct blend of humor and heavy weaponry.
