Sir Alex Ferguson has insisted that David Moyes’ failure at Manchester United was not his fault and that the slow style of play his successor introduced was alien to his players.

The legendary United manager, writing in updated chapters of his autobiography, rejects suggestions that Moyes inherited an ageing team and an ‘antiquated’ club that was already in decline.

Ferguson, who retired in May 2013 after 27 highly successful years at Old Trafford, also distanced himself from the widely-held belief that he was solely responsible for appointing Moyes.

And he says that he was not involved in the sacking of his successor after only 10 months in the job.

The 72-year-old Scot believes the former Everton manager found it a ‘massive jump’ from Goodison Park to Old Trafford. ‘He hadn’t realised just how big United is as a club,’ writes Ferguson.

Ferguson adds in the new edition, extracts of which were published by The Guardian on Tuesday, that Moyes went against United’s traditions by adopting a more conservative style of playing.

‘The pace of play slowed down a touch. The reason for playing at speed was that United players had been accustomed to operating that way,’ writes Ferguson.

‘If the tempo slowed for any reason, I would be into them at half-time. “This is not us,” I would say. Playing with speed never hindered our results. It was our way: energy and determination in the last third of the pitch.’

Ferguson relives the catalogue of poor performances and defeats which built up the pressure on Moyes.

In particular, Ferguson refers to the 3-0 home defeats by Liverpool and Manchester City in March and he describes how, in the second half against Brendan Rodgers’ team, it was ‘hard to watch that kind of outcome when Liverpool are the ones dishing out the pain’.

Ferguson also reveals in the latest version of My Autobiography — officially released tomorrow but leaked yesterday afternoon — that he was not involved in the process to sack Moyes or the decision to appoint Louis van Gaal, who he describes as ‘formidable’, last summer. Despite this, Ferguson stops short of admitting that he chose the wrong man in Moyes, saying it was a democratic decision following a thorough assessment of the candidates.

He writes: ‘There appears to be an accepted view out there that there was no process. Nonsense. We feel we did everything the right way: quietly, thoroughly, professionally.’

Ferguson won 13 Premier League titles, five FA Cups, four League Cups, two European Cups and the European Cup-Winners’ Cup during his tenure at United.

He announced his retirement in May 2013, shortly before leading United to another title success. The first edition of his autobiography was released in October 2013.

Moyes was revealed as his successor on May 9, signing a six-year contract. He was sacked on April 22 this year.

Ferguson also rails against suggestions that the set-up at United was ‘antiquated’ in the new chapter. He writes: ‘Antiquated was a bizarre description of the structure I left behind at Manchester United. Have you seen our new training ground?’

And the former United manager dismisses complaints that he left behind an old squad. He points out that the group who won the title by 11 points featured nine players aged 25 and under, including Jonny Evans, David de Gea and Danny Welbeck.

He also says that Chelsea, this season’s title favourites, have six players in their thirties but he doesn’t hear ‘any grumbles about the age of their group’.

Ferguson does reveal that he tried to talk Moyes into retaining Mike Phelan as assistant manager.

Moyes brought his own backroom staff with him from Everton and Ferguson says: ‘Maybe David felt he had to be sure all corners were covered in terms of his support system. I felt that network was already there, with plenty of great people already in important slots.'

Ferguson reveals for the first time how the Old Trafford hierarchy made the decision to sack Moyes without consulting him.

He was made aware that Moyes was on the verge of losing his job when he saw a newspaper report while flying back to Manchester from Aberdeen on the Monday after United’s 2-0 defeat at Everton.

‘At the same time, David Moyes texted me. I wasn’t sure what to say to him because I was unsure what was happening at that exact moment. I spoke to Ed (Woodward, executive vice-chairman) when I got back to Manchester and established that a final decision had been made.

‘I knew Ed wanted to tell David Moyes in person the following day and that we had come to the end of David’s time at Old Trafford.’

Ferguson rubbishes claims that he exerted too much influence at United after his retirement but admitted he spoke to Rio Ferdinand and Patrice Evra about their futures. He says players did not come to him to complain as the season unravelled under Moyes, writing: ‘Did players come to see me to complain? Did they hell. Utter nonsense.’

But he writes that Ferdinand did ‘ask my advice on his future’ and that he had a similar chat with Evra.

Ferguson denies being abused by United fans at one home game and said nobody around him heard any dissent aimed at him. He adds: ‘I wouldn’t ever expect to be abused by Manchester United fans.’
