An explosion in a Chinese coal mine killed 26 miners and another 21 have been trapped in the gas-filled pit for a day.

Rescue teams from other mines were sent 
to the Xiaojiawan Coal Mine in Sichuan province and have now pulled 107 survivors to the surface following yesterday's blast.

Fifty-one miners have been sent to hospital and seven are in a critical condition after the devastating accident.

Gruelling work: Rescuers battle frantically today to get to any remaining survivors after the explosion at Xiaojiawan Coal Mine in Panzhihua City, Sichuan Province

Race against time: The disaster came while 150 workers were underground, in the latest deadly accident to hit China's over-stretched mining industry

Rescue efforts were hampered by high 
temperatures that soared as high as 90C (194F), the rescue headquarters told China's Xinhua news agency.

Carbon monoxide was dense in the coal-rich area where the miners were trapped and rescuers have to wear masks to get to them.

A lack of ventilation 
and narrow tunnel access are making the rescue work even more hazardous.

Police are questioning the mine's owner, Zhengjin Industry and Trade Co Ltd.

China's mines are the deadliest in the 
world because of lax enforcement of safety standards and a rush to feed 
demand from a burgeoning economy.

Dangerous job: A lack of safety standards has led to the deaths of 1,973 miners in accidents last year

However, the death toll from such accidents is falling, according to government statistics.

The work safety watchdog said
1,973 miners were killed in coal mine accidents last year, down 19 per cent from 2010, when 2,433 people were killed. In 2009, 2,631 died in mines.

There were 154 miners working at Xiaojiawan mine when it exploded, in the worst accident since 35 were killed in a blast at a mine in Yunnan province in November 2011.

The State Administration of Work Safety 
said last week that it planned to close more than 600 small coal mines -
considered more dangerous than larger mines - this year to further 
reduce fatalities.

With an annual output of 90,000 tons, Xiaojaiwan is considered a small mine.
