A father who fled the U.S. before he could face justice for molesting his daughter has finally been sentenced in central Ohio after she tracked him down and then bravely stared him down in court as he was handed up to 95 years behind bars.

Frank K.C. Hertel and his wife Judy, the girl's mother, fled Arizona before his trial in 2000 and lived a secret life in Germany for nine years before his daughter Heather Orr, now 31, tracked him down in 2009 and he was finally arrested in 2012.

He had raped his daughter Heather from the time was three until she was 18 and cruelly claimed it was to teach her a lesson about men.

Heather Orr has revealed her identity saying that she wanted to give a face and a name to victims of rape

Hertel had used his brother's identity to
 take loans from the German government and run a bar and grill. The 
parents refused to allow Mrs Orr's brother to contact her.

The pedophile was finally captured thanks to the detective work of Mrs Orr herself.

Mertel was extradited to the U.S. in 2009 after his daughter who he abused tracked him down running a bar in Germany

In 2009, she typed her abusive father's name into Google and found a news article about her grandfather, who shares the same name, according to the Columbus Dispatch.

Hertel Senior had been arrested on tax evasion at Heathrow Airport in London after he allegedly owed $1.2million to the Canadian government.

Comments had been made about the Hertel family at the bottom of the article and Mrs Orr contacted people by email to see if they knew more about her father.

A website for a bar and grill revealed that her father was the owner and someone sent her a picture of her brother standing outside the business.Â 

Hertel was finally arrested and extradited back to he United States in 2012..

His wife Judy Hertel is not believed to face charges.

On Tuesday, the 51-year-old Hertel was
 sentenced to serve between 19 and 95 years in prison for assaulting his
 daughter during their time in Ohio.

He pleaded guilty Monday to three counts of rape and two counts of gross sexual imposition. He was sentenced to 5 to 25 years for each count of rape and 2 to 10 years for each count of gross sexual imposition.

Hertel admitted in court that between 
1993 and 1995, he raped and molested a female relative under the age of 
13, according to the Columbus Dispatch.

Hertel
 moved his family to Arizona where he continued to abuse his daughter.

He was charged and found guilty in 2001 of the crimes but fled the 
country.

Before he was sentenced, the judge allowed Hertel a chance to speak before the Delaware court.

Rising
 to his feet, he faced his daughter and in a high-pitched wail, sobbed: 
'I'm terrible sorry' adding that he wanted his victim to have 'closure'.

Mrs Orr, 31, who is married and has an 11-year-old daughter, faced her abuser in court and revealed her identity.

Heather Orr was comforted by her husband Daniel in court, who called his wife a 'hero not a victim'

She said: 'I wish more than anything 
that a stranger did this to me. I love my dad because he's my dad but he
 hurt me more than anyone could imagine.'

She added that she now has an 11-year-old daughter, the age she was when the sexual abuse she suffered was at its worst.

Mrs Orr's testimony to the court was interrupted by Hertel's cries of 'I'm so sorry Heather.'

The married mother said that the only thing her father was remorseful about was being caught and sent to prison.

As she finished speaking he yelled, 'I love you, Heather.'

Mertel will spend decades in jail for the molestation of his daughter which began when she was just three years old

Mrs Orr's husband Daniel described his 
wife as a 'hero, not a victim' and took the stand to ask the judge to put Hertel away 
for a very long time.

He said: 'She lost her childhood. She should never have had to face anything that she faced.'

Outside of the courtroom Mrs Orr told NBC4:
 'I want to give a face and a name to women, I want them to stand up and
 say this is not right what is happening to children and women who are abused.'

Hertel pleaded guilty to three counts of rape and two counts of gross sexual imposition in Delaware, north of Columbus.

Mrs Orr previously told authorities her father molested from from the time she was three until she was 18.

He faces 19 to 95 years in prison.

Mrs Orr has long sought justice. She first told someone about the abuse when she was in eighth grade in 1991, living in Ohio.

While a friend's father reported her allegations to authorities, prosecutors did nothing.

Her family then moved to Arizona and the abuse continued. When she was 18 she and her father went to a joint therapy session during which her father admitted what he had done and said it was, according to court records, a 'sexual lesson for his daughter on how men behave'.

The therapist then reported him to police and he was arrested. When out on bond, he and his wife fled the country.

It will be 20 years before he is up for parole.
