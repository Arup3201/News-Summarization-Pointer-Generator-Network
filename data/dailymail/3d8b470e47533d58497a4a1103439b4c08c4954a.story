Deadly mosquitoes have arrived in Britain, brought in on the tyres of lorries crossing the Channel.

Health officials are monitoring ferry ports, petrol stations and the entrance to the Channel Tunnel amid fears that more dangerous insects may be on their way.

Colonies of an invasive mosquito called the culex modestus, which is capable of spreading the infectious West Nile virus, have been found in the north Kent marshes and parts of Essex.

None of the insects tested so far are carrying the virus, but experts have set up traps to collect more samples.

West Nile virus can causes serious flu-like symptoms and leads to swelling of the brain and spinal cord in the most serious cases. And with the continuing mild weather and a string of hot and wet summers, they could thrive across Southern England.

Public Health England is also on the lookout for species such as the Asian tiger mosquito, which can act as a carrier for diseases such as potentially fatal dengue fever, which can also cause shock, bleeding and organ damage. The Asian tiger mosquito – a particularly large and aggressive insect – originates from Indonesia and other parts of South-East Asia.

But in recent years it has spread across the world, as its eggs are carried on the tyres of long-distance haulage vehicles.

This year the insect has been spotted in Belgium, Holland and Lyons in France.
