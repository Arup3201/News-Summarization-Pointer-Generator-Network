House Speaker John Boehner blasted Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday for suggesting that Republicans only attack him because he's black.

'There is no issue of race here,' he told a reporter during his weekly press briefing on Capitol Hill.

Holder went off-script Wednesday during a
 speech to Al Sharpton's National Action Network, slammed Republicans 
for consistently attacking him and Barack Obama because they are the 
first African-Americans to hold their jobs.

'What attorney general has ever had to 
deal with that kind of treatment?' he said, alluding to his status as the only African-American ever to hold that post.

WASHINGTON, DC - APRIL 10:  U.S. Speaker of the House John Boehner insisted that AG Eric Holder's race-based complaints were without merit, but his office left out that part of his remarks on its website

Angry: Attorney General Eric Holder spoke in front of a backdrop decorated with the slogan 'No Justice, No Peace,' complaining that Republicans have treated him with disrespect because he's black

Sharpton's
 group is a 23-year-old organization comprised of black civil rights 
activists, making Holder's comments appear to be a statement about his 
race, and President Obama's.

Decorations on the stage backdrop where he spoke included the slogan 'No Justice, No Peace.'

The backdrop to the growing feud is GOP 
legislators being at their wits' end waiting for the Justice Department to
 turn over tens of thousands of pages that are under subpoena, some for 
as long as three years.

The
 House of Representatives held Holder in contempt of Congress in June 
2012 because of his failure to comply with subpoenas for documents.

Boehner responded to Holder's comments: 'There is no issue of race here,' 
Boehner said. 'The frustration is that the American people have not been
 told the truth about what happened at the IRS. The American people have
 not been told the truth about what happened in Fast and Furious. The 
administration has not told the American people about Benghazi.'

'We
 have been going through all of these hearings, having to hold people in
 contempt because they have made it impossible to get to the documents. 
They have not been forthcoming; they owe the American people the truth.'

'When
 it comes to Benghazi we’ve got four Americans who are dead,' the Ohio 
politician concluded. 'Their families deserve the truth about what 
happened and the administration refuses to tell them the truth.'

A day before, Texas Republican Rep. Blake Farenthold said in a Capitol Hill hearing that he shouldn't be asking Holder any questions because he should be 'in jail' for contempt of Congress 

Holder famously claimed in 2009, and again in 2014, that America has historically been 'a nation of cowards' on racial issues.

On Wednesday he appeared to lay that burden at Republicans' feet.

'The
 last five years have been defined by significant strides and by lasting
 reforms even in the face, even in the face of unprecedented, 
unwarranted, ugly and divisive adversity,' Holder said.

'If
 you don’t believe that, you look at the way – forget about me, forget 
about me – you look at the way the attorney general of the United States
 was treated yesterday by a House committee.

It
 'has nothing to do with me, forget that,' he said. 'What attorney 
general has ever had to deal with that kind of treatment? What president
 has ever had to deal with that kind of treatment?'

The Justice Department's website includes a copy of his prepared remarks, showing that a flustered Holder improvised his complaint about Tuesday's House Judiciary Committee hearing.

'The last five years have been defined by significant strides and lasting reforms – even in the face of unprecedented adversity,' he was supposed to say. 'Last summer, after a narrowly split but divided Supreme Court struck down a key part of the historic Voting Rights Act of 1965, my colleagues and I took action.'

During Tuesday's hearing, two Republicans slammed Holder about his failure to comply with document subpoenas related to the Operation Fast and Furious gun-walking scandal.

Fast
 and Furious involved a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and 
Explosives program that sent more than 2,000 guns across the U.S.-Mexico
 border in the hope of tracking them to drug cartels. Barely one-third 
of the firearms were recovered, with some of the lost weapons later 
being linked to more than 200 deaths – including the murder of a U.S. 
Border Patrol agent.

Al Sharpton (R) has made his career about addressing racism -- often aided by substantial payments from companies his organization targets -- providing Holder with a perfect forum to complain that the GOP targeted him because he's black

Lashing out: When Texas Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert brought up Congress' criminal contempt citation against Holder onTuesday, the attorney general snapped, 'You don't want to go there, buddy!'

Following years of stonewalling over subpoenaed documents related to the scandal, the House took a vote and found Holder in criminal and civil contempt of Congress.

Rep. Blake Fahrenthold, a Texas Republican, refused to ask Holder any questions during the hearing Tuesday, saying that Holder would be 'in jail' if he were an ordinary American who ignored a subpoena from the DOJ.

And when Rep. Louis Gohmert, another Texas GOP member, brought up the contempt resolution and suggested that Holder hadn't taken it seriously, the attorney general snapped.

'You don't want to go there, buddy!' he carped.

Holder was expected in some corners to cancel his speech following revelations earlier in the week that Sharpton, now an MSNBC host, became a mob informant in the 1980s following a police sting operation in which he was caught trying to buy large amounts of illegal drugs from an undercover officer.
