The difference between east and west, rich and poor becomes stark when looking at how our children sleep at night.

Where Children Sleep, a project by photographer James Mollison, is set to highlight children’s rights by contrasting the different living situations for young people across the globe.

We meet nine-year-old Dong from China who sleeps underneath a poster of Chairman Mao with his parents and sister; Roathy, eight, from Cambodia who lives on a rubbish tip; Kaya, four, from Tokyo, whose mother makes her at least three new dresses a month; and Indira from Nepal who has worked in the local granite quarry since the age of three.

‘I found myself thinking about my bedroom: how significant it was during my childhood, and how it reflected what I had and who I was,’ Mr Mollison said.

‘It occurred to me that a way to address some of the complex situations and social issues affecting children would be to look at the bedrooms of children in all kinds of different circumstances.’

Roathy, aged eight, Phnom Penh, Cambodia: Roathy lives with his family on a rubbish tip, on the outskirts of the Cambodian capital along with an estimated five thousand people who all pay rent to live on the dump. His bed is made of old tyres. At 6am every morning, Roathy and hundreds of other children are given a shower and breakfast at a local charity centre, which is often the only meal of the day. He then spends his day working, collecting cans and plastic his family sells on to a recycling company

Jyoti, aged 14, Makwanpur, Nepal: Jyoti left school at a young age in order to become a domestic worker, but was treated so badly she ran away and now lives with one of her sisters in the Nepalese countryside where she works in the fields.
