Furious parents have accused a school of taking autistic and dyslexic children out of classes to 'hide them' from Ofsted inspectors.

Children were removed from English, maths and science lessons at Matravers School in Westbury, Wiltshire, last week as the education watchdog visited.

Parents say disabled children were hidden from Ofsted because the school was criticised in its last inspection for the way it taught special needs pupils.

Enraged father Martin Gillingham said his 15-year-old son Jamie, who suffers from dyslexia, was removed from important English and maths lessons and put into a mechanics lesson for two days while the inspectors were at the school.

Mr Gillingham, a former soldier, said: 'I'm furious. My son didn't mind that he was moved classes as he does well in motor mechanics as to him that's the easy subject, but obviously the other subjects like English are the ones he struggles in.

'Not only does this give a false impression to Ofsted but my main concern is that he is now missing out on lessons where he needs the extra teaching.

'The reason given to him by the school was that they didn't want to risk that he along with all the others, another five in total, might cause disruption during the visit.

'Their reason is completely unfounded without any justification and purely based on an assumption.'

The 46-year-old, who has two other children at the secondary school, said Jamie's autistic classmates were also 'hidden' from the inspectors.

The Royal Military Police veteran fumed: 'I spoke to another parent whose son is autistic and she said she received a call from the school on Wednesday basically saying we think it would be better if he didn't come in as they didn't think her son would be able to cope with an inspector sat at the back of the room.

'They didn't give her an option, they were telling her not asking. She asked if that was allowed and was told it would be an authorised absence.'

Writing on Facebook, school governor Russell Hawker accused parents of 'trying to cause trouble for no good reason'.

'A small number of very autistic kids were considered to need protecting from the obvious change to routine that would normally occur during the normal full OFSTED inspection,' he said.

'The parents had to be informed so they could decide whether to send their children in. It is sad that some misguided people have stirred a false and grossly misleading story.

'It is quite clear to me that some parents are simply trying to cause trouble for no good reason. The school basically did exactly what other schools do, in the best interests of everyone.' 

In a statement, the school said: 'Matravers School is proud to be a fully inclusive school that successfully accommodates students with a wide variety of educational needs.

'The school was alerted to some threads of negative comments on local social media sites concerning our support for students during the inspection. As a matter of policy Matravers School does not engage in discussions or comment on social media sites.

'We encourage parents who have any concerns to contact the school so we can respond to their individual queries sensitively and constructively. We thank the vast majority of parents who have supported us through this period. All of our students have represented the school with pride.'

Inspectors visited the school on Thursday and Friday last week. Ofsted's last report of the school, in 2013, said: 'Low attainers, students eligible for pupil premium support and most of those identified as disabled or with special educational needs are not making as much progress as their peers.'

An Ofsted spokesman said: 'When Ofsted visits a school, inspectors gather evidence about how well individual pupils and particular groups of pupils, such as those with special educational needs, are learning, gaining knowledge, and making progress.

'Ofsted cannot comment on individual complaints.'
