Firebrand: A portrait of the Rt Revd John Colenso

A firebrand bishop who denied the 'historical truth' of the Bible and defended the rights of Zulus to have two wives will have his controversial views commemorated 200 years after his birth.

The private letters of John Colenso, who was the first bishop of Natal in South Africa, will be opened to the public for the first time today at the University of Cambridge.

The Rt Revd Mr Colenso, caused a scandal in Victorian England by denying the literal truth of the opening books of the Bible, including Genesis and Exodus.

He said that the books, then thought to have been written by Moses, could not possibly be the work of the Biblical figure himself, of anyone with experience of the events it describes.

The bishop added that the segment of the Bible - also known as the Pentateuch - 'cannot possibly be regarded as historically true'.

His position - a controversial one at the time - led to him being branded a heretic and excommunicated from the Church of England, though he managed to remain a bishop after a series of court rulings.

In a published explanation of his theory about the Bible, he wrote: 'I have arrived at the 
conclusion that the Pentateuch cannot have been written by Moses, or by 
anyone acquainted personally with the facts which it professes to 
describe, and, further, that the whole (so-called) Mosaic narrative, by 
whomsoever written, cannot possibly be regarded as historically true.'

Denier: The Rt Revd Mr Colenso argued that books of the Bible thought to be by Moses, pictured here before the burning bush, could not possibly be by him

He also drew the wrath of the South African colonial authorities for his sympathies with the native Zulu people.

The bishop, who wrote the first textbooks on the Zulu language, supported the Africans in some of their struggles against British rule.

The Rt Revd Mr Colenso publicly criticised the British for declaring war on the tribe over land in 1879, and also wrote the the Archbishop of Canterbury to complain about their treatment of Zulu converts with multiple wives.

The official Church stance was that such
 men, many of whom married twice before changing religion, should disown
 one wife and any children. It was thought that for Zulus, marriage was 
little more than business transaction.

Pro-Zulu: Colenso was an outspoken supporter of the Zulu people in South Africa, who wrote the first textbooks for their language, left, and supported their king at the time, pictured right in one of Colenso's books, by saying the British were wrong to declare war on them in 1879

But Colenso disagreed, insisting that these were stable and loving relationships, comparable with those in the West, and should be allowed to remain.

Kathryn McKee, a librarian at St John's College, where the bishop was a student, said: 'Colenso occupied a position of 
influence and was deeply controversial, partly because many of his views
 were slightly ahead of their time.'

The exhibition, called The Missionary College, will run from February 3 until April 17.
