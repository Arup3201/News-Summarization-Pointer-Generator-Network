With an all-day breakfast by Heston ­Blumenthal, a free personal shopper and the world’s only John Lewis Duty Free shop (just along from Cath ­Kidston), it is, surely, the poshest airport ­terminal in the world.

In fact, it’s so grand that it will be opened by the Sovereign herself and won’t even have a number. It will have a name — although whoever came up with this one should be sent to the Tower.

As of June, when this £2.5 billion ­monster is opened, Heathrow’s new ­Terminal 2 will be officially renamed The Queen’s ­Terminal — which sounds like a statement of ­republican intent or a very bleak ­medical prognosis.

The re-opening of Terminal Two at Heathrow Airport next month will see it be renamed as The Queen's Terminal

I certainly wouldn’t advise mentioning ‘the Queen’s terminal’ anywhere near the Duke of Edinburgh. Back will come the retort: ‘No, she jolly well isn’t.’

Certainly, as terminals go, it’s very shiny and very smart. But for all the wavy roof design and Britain’s biggest indoor ­sculpture, not to mention a lot of PR nonsense about ‘Revolutionising The Check-In Experience’, it’s not much of a change. You’ll still end up in the same old queues to have your nail clippers confiscated by the same old jobsworths before walking half a mile to line up all over again at the gate.

This week’s chaotic scenes at several British airports — fisticuffs and four-hour queues at Passport Control — are a timely reminder that when the computers go down, the colour scheme couldn’t matter less. If you’ve lost your luggage, you’re unlikely to be impressed that the desk attendants have been rebranded as ­‘Passenger Service Ambassadors’ (they really have).

I doubt this place will ever see quite such a good-natured band of punters as the 3,000 passengers I join for the first big rehearsal this week. After that famously inept opening of Heathrow’s Terminal 5 in 2008, the airport management are taking no chances this time around.

The new terminal will include a Heston Blumenthal Cafe and the first duty free John Lewis

The builders actually finished ­construction work last November in order to leave a clear six months for fine-tuning everything. This week’s epic play-acting exercise is the first attempt at an ordinary day.

With up to 20 million passengers on 23 ­airlines (including United, Lufthansa and Aer Lingus) expected through this building every year, there could be 3,000 people ­coming through here each hour. That is ­double the number using the old Terminal 2 before it was knocked down in 2009 (since when its tenant airlines have been lodging in other terminals).

There was, interestingly, no problem rounding up this number of volunteers, in exchange for a packed lunch and a sneak preview. Local newspaper ads have helped to recruit 14,000 volunteers — more than at the 2012 Olympic opening ceremony — for the entire test programme.

‘It’s a nice day out, and I remember ­Heathrow in the days when passengers waited inside tents,’ says retired airport worker Pepina Powell, from Oxfordshire. She and her husband Les, a retired RAF navigator, are here to board an imaginary flight to Bern.

The new sculpture within the terminal is called the 'Slipstream'. It was designed by British artist Richard Wilson

‘Best of all,’ beams Pepina, ‘they’ve knocked 30 years off my age!’

Every single volunteer has been handed an individual script on arrival, complete with name, age, nationality, boarding pass and replica passport. Some are allocated an oversize cabin bag to test the reactions of staff at the gate. Others are told to dawdle in Duty Free and hold up everyone else.

Retired book distributor Neil Hayman is rather sorry not to be his new alter ego. He is playing a ­youthful American called Kris Sun with a United Airlines ticket to Miami. Roy and Janet Haines, from Reading, ­Berkshire, are less thrilled. Not only have they been recast as a male couple from South Africa, but Roy has been given a First Class seat to ­Singapore while Janet has been plonked in Economy.

The first thing we all encounter on turning up is a 256-ft, 77-ton ­aluminium-plated creation called Slipstream, which hangs over the covered walkway at the front of the terminal. Designed by the artist Richard Wilson, it replicates the exact path of a stunt plane swooping through the terminal.

The 'Slipstream' artwork is suspended 18 meters above the ground, weighs 77 tonnes and is 78 meters in length

The £2.5 million result might best be described as a cross between a drill bit and a piece of pasta, but it is a clever concept, well-executed. Many people stop to take its photograph.

‘We wanted something which reflects Britain as a world centre of the arts and of engineering,’ explains Heathrow’s development director, John Holland-Kaye.

A Cambridge-educated classicist, he explains that the new terminal is part of a 40-year plan to transform Heathrow from a hotch-potch of five ill-fitting terminals to a sleeker airport with two mega-­terminals — this one and Terminal 5.

Each has a main building linked to a colossal satellite annexe by ­tunnel. On its own, the new ‘royal’ terminal is already bigger than Stansted Airport.

If Heathrow’s Spanish owners, Ferrovial, get permission for the third runway which they ­desperately want — and which half of London does not — then these two giants will have to grow even bigger.

The much-trumpeted ‘revolutionary’ check-in is about as radical as Antiques ­Roadshow but the security hall is unusually big and bright. One ­volunteer, who works at the airport, tells me that she is dismayed by the lack of privacy.

‘I have been asked to take off ­several layers of clothing with a queue of men right behind me, and there are no cubicles,’ she says. ‘People from some Middle Eastern countries will be appalled.’

A construction worker puts the finishing touches to the new terminal which is due to open on June 23

Once inside, there are some exotic additions to the usual spread of cheap fags, booze and scent. ­Heston Blumenthal’s Perfectionists’ Café will feature liquid nitrogen ice cream and staff will be trained to grind all the burgers along the grain of the meat for optimum juiciness.

Burger King? Mcdonald’s? ­Forget it. The nearest thing to fast food will be a Leon’s deli, and there are no less than two ­Harrods stores — one for fine china and fancy tea, the other ­selling only watches.

‘We had five bidders for every ­outlet and we want to showcase the best of Britain,’ Mr Holland-Kaye says.In the atrium, things have turned even more surreal. A compere is leading 1,000 volunteers in a formation disco dance to the 1990 hit Altogether Now for a corporate video.

I follow a party heading for an Air Canada flight to Toronto. It involves going down Britain’s second-longest escalator, along three travelators and up a further pair of escalators.

‘I have to say it’s a long way,’ sighs Carole Shaw from Bromley, who has become a 30-year-old Canadian called Barbie for the purposes of this journey.

The check-in desks at the airport, which were put to the test during a volunteer exercise

No sooner has she made it all the way to the plane than all the outbound ‘passengers’ become inbound ones. All are handed a new identity and a new script, and are redirected into the arrivals stream.

Carole morphs into a 36-year-old Kiwi called Julius Weil who has just arrived from Auckland.

Half an hour and a long walk later, I meet her again at baggage reclaim where she is supposed to pick up a suitcase. Except it’s not there.

‘I’ve lost all my luggage!’ she laughs, and then remembers the point of all this. ‘I suppose I’d better try to be angry.’

The refurbished Terminal Two took five years to develop and build. The terminal is bigger than Stansted Airport alone

Heathrow’s managers are ­praying that all this role play will pay dividends when their swanky new glass house opens for ­business in June.

My one reservation is that it may be a little too upmarket. It is certainly impressive, although some of its customers may find it a little elitist for passengers on some of this terminal’s resident airlines. How many of those flying on, say,

Ethiopian Airways will want a personal shopper or a little something from Bulgari?

And they really must do something about the name.

Why not the Queen Elizabeth II Terminal? Then, like New York’s JFK, we can all abbreviate it to ‘QE2’. And it won’t annoy the Duke of Edinburgh either.
