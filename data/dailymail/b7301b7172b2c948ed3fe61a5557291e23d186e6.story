It was supposed to be a record of the happiest day of their lives - a keepsake to hold on to for years and share with family and friends.

But when newlyweds Evette and Gary Crack were handed their wedding day photograph collection they were horrified to discover a batch of pictures which were blurry and featured them at unflattering angles.

In one picture the photographer had managed to completely cut both of their heads off as they stood side-by-side.

What a shot: In one picture the photographer captured the back of their heads as they make their way down some stairs (left). Another picture features Mrs Crack as she tries to keep out of the rain (right)

Now the distraught couple are suing the photographer who they say ruined their big day, according to The Sun.

Mrs Crack, 32, of Coventry, has also said the couple are having to save up in order to hold the reception again and do a re-shoot.

She told the paper: 'It's just awful, she's robbed us of everything.

'Nothing is ever going to get our day back.

'She said she was a pro, but didn't even get any shots of Gary's elderly grandparents who came up from London.'

The photographer captured a blurry image of them dancing, complete with a yellow lens flare, while another picture features the back of their heads as they make their way down a staircase.

Unflattering: The couple were sent this picture which features Mr Crack's hand covering his wife's face

Elsewhere, a blue bin features heavily in the foreground of one photograph of Evette trying to avoid the rain in her dress.

Mr Crack, 30, has said the collection does not feature any good photographs.

The photographer told The Sun the location of the event, a 14th-century manor house, was difficult to shoot pictures in.
