A BBC tennis commentator said sorry to former GB Davis Cup captain David Lloyd after suggesting he could be prevented from leading the Lawn Tennis Association because of alleged 'personal problems'

Andrew Castle was forced into the official apology after his comments during a rain delay chat with Sue Barker at the Aegon Championships at Queen’s Club in Kensington, London.

He has agreed to pay undisclosed damages to Mr Lloyd.

Tennis commentator Andrew Castle, 49, has apologised to former player David Lloyd, 65, right, after suggesting alleged 'personal problems' could rule him out of becoming chief executive of the Lawn Tennis Association

Mr Castle made the remarks during the AEGON tennis championships at London's Queen's Club on June 12

Interest around succession at the LTA
 has been heightened by the widespread disbelief at recent revelations 
that current chief executive Roger Draper was earning £640,000 a year.

He is due to stand down in September and leaves what is regarded as a generally under-performing organisation.

A statement published on the BBC website said: 'BBC commentator Andrew Castle suggested there were issues in the personal life of David Lloyd which made him unsuitable to be considered for the role of CEO of the LTA.

'Mr Castle would wish to make clear that his comments were without foundation and apologises to Mr Lloyd for any embarrassment or distress caused.'

It is understood businessman Mr Lloyd was alerted about the disparaging remark by his brother John, a BBC tennis pundit who will be working alongside Mr Castle at Wimbledon.

A joint statement release by the men today, seen by The Guardian, said: 'The parties have now agreed terms to bring the matter to a close, which involves the payment of damages and legal costs.

'However, Mr Castle would like to put the record straight and express again his personal apology to Mr Lloyd. He made his remarks, which were completely without substance, in the hurried exchanges of a live debate.

'Mr Lloyd has accepted Mr Castle's apology and the payment of damages. Mr Lloyd and Mr Castle are pleased to have been able to resolve matters amicably and now consider the matter to be behind them.'

Mr Castle's gaffes didn't end there.

He was accused of causing ructions by announcing at Queen’s that Andy Murray was donating his winnings to the Rally Against Cancer charity fund when the Scot wanted to keep it private.

Murray said: ‘I haven’t spoken to anyone about it.'

Andrew Castle was speculating over the future head of the Lawn Tennis Association, based in Roehampton

Mr Castle was a professional tennis player for six years from 1986 and was a regular member of the British Davis Cup team.  He represented England in the Olympics twice, and reached the third round in the 1987 US Open, losing to Boris Becker.

He became a television presenter after retiring from tennis in 1992, and hosted GMTV for a decade.  He has commentated on tennis for 10 years, working alongside Tim Henman, Boris Becker, Sue Barker and John Lloyd.

David Lloyd, who was born in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, was one of the most successful British tennis players of the 1970s and 1980s, alongside his younger brother, John.

He captained the British Davis Cup team, and went on to found a successful chain of eponymous health and leisure clubs.  He has coached Tim Henman, and is a keen art collector.
