Former Manchester United goalkeeper Tomasz Kuszczak has joined Wolves on a short-term deal.

The 32-year-old initially joined the club on a two-week trial but, after impressing, has signed a deal until early 2015.

Speaking to the club's official website, Kuszczak said: 'I'm very pleased, I think it's a big club. Definitely a club that deserves to be in the Premier League and I want to be a part of this club.

'I tried to find a place for myself in football for the last couple of months. I've been training with several clubs and waiting for the right call. Wolves came and I decided to sign a contract here and I'm glad about that.

'It was always my dream to be a footballer, football is my world. I am a part of the Wolves family now and I'm going to give everything to help them.' 

Kuszczak was released by Brighton at the end of last season and the Polish keeper admitted he had nothing but respect for his old club.

Kuszczak had been on trial with Championship outfit Wolves for two weeks before they offered him a contract

He said: 'I had good seasons with Brighton, we managed to be in the play-offs twice in a row which was a big success for the club.

'I enjoyed my time there, I played almost every game. I didn't expect a break after leaving but I'm glad now to be here and to be part of the team.

'I'm glad to be involved in football again. From my point of view I'm going to try and help the team, help the players and share my experiences from different teams over the past years.

'I'm a quite experienced goalkeeper but I've still got stuff to learn. I always say that because football changes all the time.'
