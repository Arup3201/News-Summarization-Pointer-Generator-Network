CBI director-general John Cridland said the economy has started to gain momentum

Employers' group the CBI has hiked its forecast for economic growth for this year – giving a further boost to hopes Britain is dragging itself from the post-recession doldrums.

The body, which represents around 240,000 UK companies, raised its expectations for growth in gross domestic product from 1 per cent to 1.2 per cent during 2013 as confidence among business people increases.

And for next year, the CBI reckons the economic recovery will gather pace with growth of 2.3 per cent compared with 2 per cent forecast previously.

An increase in households’ disposable income, investment among businesses and the strengthening housing market will all support domestic demand, the organisation said in its latest forecasts.

The upgrade to economic prospects comes after data from the eurozone last week confirmed the single currency bloc has emerged from recession.

The CBI said the good news from Britain’s trading partner, along with a broader global recovery, means a positive boost to exports can be expected.

But it’s not all plain sailing.

The CBI warns that the government’s plan to rebalance the economy away from the dominant service sector – which depends on consumer spending – and towards manufacturing and overseas sales is taking longer than hoped.

CBI director-general John Cridland said: ‘The economy has started to gain momentum and confidence is picking up, but it’s still early days.

‘We need to see a full-blown rebalancing of our economy, with stronger business investment and trade before we can call a sustainable recovery. We hope that will begin to emerge next year, as the eurozone starts growing again.’

Cridland also urged the Government to ‘get behind talented UK businesses’ to help them break into new export markets around the globe.

Meanwhile the organisation also gave its backing to new Bank of England governor Mark Carney, saying the Bank’s recently-announced ‘forward guidance’ policy - designed to provide reassurance that interest rates will remain low for some time to come - will add to positive sentiment.

The Bank of England has indicated the cost of borrowing will remain at its historic low of 0.5 per cent until at least 2016

The bank has indicated the cost of borrowing will remain at its historic low of 0.5 per cent until at least 2016, although some City economists believe interest rates will have to rise sooner.

The CBI predicts a slow strengthening of household spending in the second half of this year and through the next, with confidence lifting and better credit conditions.

Improved spending power should be supported by a fall-back in inflation, a rise in disposable income and a stable labour market, it forecasts.

Business investment, set to fall 2.8 per cent this year should grow by 7.3 per cent in 2014, the organisation said, with export growth of 0.7 per cent rising to 4.9 per cent - though imports are also expected to go up, from a negative 0.3 per cent this year to a rise of 4.4 per cent.

Unemployment is expected to fall from 7.8 per cent in 2013 to 7.6 per cent in 2014, as the number of hours worked increases and productivity begins to recover.

The joblessness figure has taken on increased significance after the Bank of England said that, subject to inflation fears, interest rates would remain at historic lows until it fell to 7 per cent.
