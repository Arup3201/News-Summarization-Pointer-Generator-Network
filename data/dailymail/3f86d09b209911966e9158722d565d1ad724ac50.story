Sources told the New York Daily News that Riley and his pals were on top of a President Street residence. 

Those sources also stated that Riley sprung first from the rooftop.

The Daily News quoted father Patrick Riley as saying 'I want my son, my boy, my Tyhreek. What was he doing up there?'

Sources told the Daily News that Riley was discovered dead on the ground in the middle of the buildings by a superintendent.

Nicholas Brown, a neighbor, told the newspaper 'He fell right in front of my kitchen window. 

'It looked like he hit his head on the walls all the way down.'

Police told NBC New York that Riley and his friends were playing the game Manhunt.

Virginia Straker told the NBC affiliate station 'He is a very nice kid. He's in the PathFinder club, he sings in the choir, and he is a very helpful kid.'

Rev. Gizelda Dawson told WABC 'He's a nice little boy, he has manners, he's my friend. He always give a smile whenever he pass, like I can't say anything bad about him.'

A female resident told the ABC affiliate station 'Lately, I've been seeing them up there [on the roof].'

She said 'They're always up there, I say, "You guys get down from there" - the after school hours, I'm a teacher, when I come home from school, they're running around up there, and I can hear them, because I live on the top floor.'
