Hundreds of killers and thousands of drunk drivers were released back into the U.S. by immigration officials in what critics are calling stark evidence the Obama administration has not focused on serious criminals in its immigration enforcement.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement released 36,000 immigrants from custody last year, 116 of whom had convictions for homicide, 43 who carried convictions for negligent manslaughter, 14 for voluntary manslaughter and one who's conviction was classified by the agency as 'homicide-willful kill-public official-gun'

As the immigrants were in the process of being deported, ICE could have held them in detention until they could be removed from the country, according to data from the Center for Immigration Studies reported by The Washington Times.

'This would be considered the worst 
prison break in American history, except it was sanctioned by the 
president and perpetrated by our own immigration officials,' Rep. 
Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican, told reporters. 'The administration's actions are outrageous. They willfully and knowingly put the interests 
of criminal immigrants before the safety and security of the American 
people.'

At the Center for Immigration studies, policy studies director Jessica Vaughan called the numbers evidence the administration had failed to target dangerous criminals.

'We keep hearing from the administration
 that they are focused like a laser on enforcement against the worst of 
the worst, convicted criminals, as their top priority. On the other 
hand, they are releasing, at a rate of about 100 a day, aliens from 
their custody with criminal convictions, and many of them are serious 
criminal convictions,' Vaughan said.

ICE officials claimed many of the releases were mandated by court order

ICE said many of the released were under electronic monitoring, had posted bond, or were required to check in with officers regularly.

There have also been court decisions forcing release, such as a 2001 Supreme Court ruling that found immigrants could not be held longer than six months if their home countries refused to take them back.

Approximately 75 per cent of convicted murderers released in 2013 were 'mandatory releases' according to ICE.

'Others, typically 
those with less serious offenses, were released as a discretionary 
matter after career law enforcement officers made a judgment regarding 
the priority of holding the individual, given ICEâ€™s resources, and 
prioritizing the detention and removal of individuals who pose a risk to
 public safety or national security,' ICE stated.

Rep. Bob Goodlatte, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said he and Smith requested ICE release numbers but have so far been denied the information.

Critics say the releases are evidence the Obama administration has failed to focus on dangerous criminals

'These criminals should be locked up, not roaming our streets,' the lawmakers said in a joint statement.

In its yearly budget request, ICE asked for funding for more than 30,500 detention beds per day, a drop from the 34,000 numbered in current law.

Among the 36,007 ciminal aliens on the agency's roles, there were a combined 15,635 convictions for drunk driving, 9, 187 convictions for 'dangerous drugs,' 2,691 for assault, 1,724 for weapons offenses, and 303 for 'flight escape.'

In 2013 ICE also released thousands of immigrants, calling it the result of sequester budget cuts.

They later clarified it was actually the regular budgeting process that led to the releases, as they had been holding more than 34,000 detainees for too long to support.
