We have all heard of the Midas touch. But in certain circles, it is the Middleton touch that is really gaining traction in common parlance. 

For every item worn by sisters Kate and Pippa become major hits for the stores or labels concerned - and the peach dress worn by Pippa Middleton to the Waitrose summer party earlier this week is no exception.

The £285 dress is the work of British designer Tabitha Webb and was being sold exclusively via luxury retail site my-wardrobe.com - until the Middleton sister stepped out wearing it on Wednesday and a flurry of Pippa fans rushed to bag their own version.

The cap-sleeved Sundance dress is billed on the site as being designed 'to fit perfectly for summer events, summer weddings or parties' - so it looks like Pippa applied the dress to the appropriate occasion too. Well done her!

Tabitha Webb, the British talent behind the dress, has already seen great success with her eponymous label, which she has been focusing on full-time after folding Project D London, the label she ran along with Dannii Minogue.

It is not a bad item for Pippa to spark a run on either, given that it was created with goodwill in mind. For each dress sold, 30 per cent of the proceeds go to charity, meaning that
for each one, £85.50 will be donated to Fashion Targets Breast 
Cancer, one of the major campaigns run by Breakthrough Breast Cancer. 

The site will be accepting pre-orders for the second drop now, so if you're keen to polish up like Pippa while helping a good cause, visit my-wardrobe.com now.

Sellout! No joy here - the dress has sold out in every size - but pre-orders for a second drop are being taken
