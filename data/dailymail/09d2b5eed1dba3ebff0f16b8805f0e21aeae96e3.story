It’s a mother’s day experience that will bring tears to her eyes… and with its £7,500 price tag, it might bring some to yours as well.

Personalised bouquets, bespoke cocktails, a luxury breakfast banquet cooked by a professional chef and a day of shopping with a personal shopper, this is a once-in-a-life-time luxury-laden day tailored for your mother on Sunday, 15 March.  

The Ultimate Mother’s Day Experience from Fortnum & Mason will also treat your entire family to personal consultations from the department store's experts.  

Fortnum & Mason's Ultimate Mother's Day experience starts at £7,500

The day begins when a chauffeur arrives at your designated address with a team of Fortnum’s experts.

Your mother will be presented with a bouquet of her favourite flowers before a butler then prepares a range of  tempting breakfast cocktails.

While all this is happening, Fortnum’s chef will cook up a breakfast banquet for the whole family – using the world’s finest ingredients and served with personalised Champagne to commemorate the occasion.

After breakfast the whole family will be chauffeured to Fortnum’s flagship store at Piccadilly for an afternoon of pure luxury.

Mum will be treated to personal consultations with Fortnum’s in-house experts, including a perfumer and Fortnum’s own in-house milliner, while the family joins a personal shopper to select the finest Mother’s Day gifts from across the store’s five fabulous floors.

With Mum feeling suitable spoiled, and all gifts secured, you’ll then make your way to the private tea tasting room for a consultation with a Tearista to find your perfect blend, accompanied by a show-stopping personalised cake.

To round off the day you’ll be chauffeured home complete with your gifts and a luxury hamper packed full of Mum’s favourite Fortnum’s delights.

‘You will liaise with Fortnum’s team to tailor the day’s activities to your Mum’s tastes, ensuring every element is sure to surprise, delight and spoil her on her special day. And nothing is out of the realms of possibility,’ said a spokesperson for Fortnum & Mason.

The Ultimate Mother’s Day Experience is limited to addresses within Greater London and the Home Counties. Prices start from £7,500.
