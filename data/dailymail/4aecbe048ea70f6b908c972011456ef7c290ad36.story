Musicians who want to write a chart-topping song need to move in a different musical direction than the pack, research has revealed.  

More than 25,000 songs on the Billboard 100 from 1958 to 2013 were analysed as part of the study of audio attributes.

It found the key to a hit song was that it should sound different from anything else in the charts, but not so distant that it puts music fans off.

Adele's number one song Someone Like You, Simon and Garfunkle's Bridge Over Trouble Water, and Whitney Houston's I Will Always Love You, all hit the top spot because they were distinct from other songs around at the time.

The graph shows that songs in the top 20 show the least amount of conventionality out of any section of the Billboard Hot 100 over time

Researchers discovered that songs that faltered in the middle of the Billboard 100 were most likely to sound the same, whilst weird singles failed to make the charts at all.

The study was carried out by Noah Askin, professor of Organizational Behaviour at INSEAD, in Paris, and Michael Mauskapf, a PHD student in Management and Organisations at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, in Chicago.

They used Spotify's audio analysis program, The Echo Nest, to examine the singles and created a new metric called Song Conventionality.

As part of the study they examined 11 attributes of each song, including danceability, duration, key, temp and acousticness.   

Whitney Houston's I Will Always Love You and Simon and Garfunkle's Bridge Over Trouble Water also went to number one because they stood out

The number one song is the least conventional of the top 10. The top 10 are less conventional than the top 20

'Songs that are slightly less conventional than average tend to outperform their peers on the charts,' the pair added.

The researchers found that songs that secured the coveted number one spot moved in a different musical direction and stood out from the pack of other musical releases.

However, Mr Mauskapf and Mr Askin added:  'Nevertheless, predicting hit songs is nearly impossible to do, because performance is largely contingent on a song's relationship to other songs that are produced and released contemporaneously.'
