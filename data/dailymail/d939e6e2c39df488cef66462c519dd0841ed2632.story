Stoke City striker Peter Crouch was treated to a double celebration by wife Abbey Clancy over the weekend.

The Crouch household was in fine spirits as the former Tottenham Hotspur and Portsmouth man celebrated his birthday and a new contract with Stoke.

Abbey treated the 34-year-old Potters ace to a Stoke designed birthday cake and shared the picture on Twitter with her followers.

The couple are also expecting their second child together and Crouch has already revealed he is hoping for a boy this time round.

Crouch, who became the club's record signing when he joined from Tottenham for £10million, recently put pen-to-paper on a new deal with Mark Hughes' side.

And the robotic striker believes he can help the club claim some silverware in his remaining time with the club.

He said: 'We have achieved so much in the time I have been here - finishing in the top 10 (of the Premier League for the first time in Stoke's history) last year was huge for us and the squad we have right now is full of quality.

'I'm just so happy that we are doing well and now we want to keep moving forward and possibly lift a bit of silverware - which is achievable.

'I enjoy every minute of training and I also enjoy every minute I am on the pitch on matchdays too. I want to play a big part here in the coming years.

'I have two more years now to make an impact. I've not signed the contract to sit here and put my feet up, I'm here to help the team improve and to win things.'
