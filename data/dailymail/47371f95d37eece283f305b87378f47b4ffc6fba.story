General Motors says a 'pattern of incompetence and neglect' is to blame for a long-delayed recall on dangerously defective ignition switches which have been linked to the deaths of 13 drivers.

Company CEO Mary Barra released the results of a 'deeply troubling' internal investigation on Thursday, which found that many employees who could have uncovered the problem didn't speak up.

Barra has since fired 15 employees - including the ignition's designer - and has announced intentions to start a compensation fund for victims' families.

Sorry: General Motors CEO Mary Barra says a 'pattern of incompetence and neglect' led to a long-delayed recall of faulty ignitions in their Chevy Cobalt

The fund will be administered by compensation expert Kenneth Feinberg, who handled the victims funds for September 11, the Boston Marathon bombing and BP oil spill.

The fund will begin taking claims on August 1, but it's still unclear how much money will be involved.

Barra said the company would 'do the right things for those who were harmed' and 'everything in our power to make sure this never happens again.'

Barra called the investigation, which 
she ordered in March, 'brutally tough and deeply troubling.' It took GM 
more than a decade to report the deadly switch failures to regulators 
and the public, and to recall the cars.

'I
 hate sharing this with you just as much as you hate hearing it,' Barra 
told employees in a town hall meeting at GM's suburban Detroit technical
 center. 'But I want you to hear it. I want you to remember it. I want 
you to never forget it.' Barra then promised to 'fix the failures in our
 system.'

The crisis began 
in February, when GM recalled 780,000 older-model Chevrolet Cobalt and 
Pontiac G5 small cars because of defective ignition switches. GM soon 
added the Saturn Ion and other small cars to the recall, which ballooned
 to 2.6 million cars worldwide.

The
 switches in the cars can slip out of the 'run' position and shut down 
the engine. That disables the power-assisted steering and brakes and can
 cause drivers to lose control. It also disables the air bags. GM 
reiterated Thursday that it only links 13 deaths to the problem, but 
trial lawyers suing the company put the death toll closer to 60.

Barra
 said attorney Anton Valukas interviewed 230 employees and reviewed 41 
million documents to produce the report, which also makes 
recommendations to avoid future safety problems. The government was 
expected to release the report later Thursday.

Barra
 said the report found that the company was operating in 'silos,' and 
individuals who could have helped uncover the problem didn't speak up.

'Because
 of the actions of a few people, and the willingness of others in the 
company to condone bureaucratic processes that avoided accountability, 
we let these customers down,' Barra said. She again apologized to the 
families of those who died.

Last
 month, GM paid a $35 million fine — the largest ever assessed by the 
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration — for failing to report 
the problem quickly to federal regulators. GM knew about problems with 
the ignition switches as early as 2001, and in 2005 it told dealers to 
tell owners to take excess items off their key chains so they wouldn't 
drag down the ignition switch.

In
 2006, GM engineer Ray DeGiorgio — who designed the switch — approved a 
change in the switch design, but didn't inform the government or change 
the corresponding part number. In subsequent years, that made it harder 
for other GM engineers to figure out why older Cobalts performed worse 
than newer ones.

Barra confirmed Thursday that two employees placed on leave in April have been fired; DeGiorgio was one of those employees.

GM
 began repairing the cars in April, and had fixed 86,000 as of Thursday.
 But it has said it doesn't expect to fix them all until October. GM 
says the cars are safe as long as customers only use the key and have no
 extra items on their key chains.

Barra
 named a new safety chief at GM in March and pledged to quickly work 
through a backlog of potential recalls. As a result, the automaker has 
recalled a record 15.8 million cars and trucks in North America so far 
this year.

The company took a
 $1.3 billion charge in the first quarter to pay for the recalls. It 
expects to take a $400 million recall-related charge in the second 
quarter.

The report doesn't 
complete GM's recall saga. The automaker still faces a criminal 
investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice — led by the same team 
that recently reached a $1.2 billion settlement with Toyota over its 
2010 sudden acceleration recall. It also faces multiple lawsuits from 
victims and from owners whose say their cars have lost value.

Barra, who testified before House and Senate committees in April, will also likely be called back to Washington.

Sen.
 Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science and 
Technology Committee's consumer protection subcommittee, said she 
intends to hold a hearing on the delayed recalls later this summer.

'I
 won't be letting GM leadership, or federal regulators, escape 
accountability for these tragedies,' she said in a statement. 'The 
families of those affected deserve no less.'
