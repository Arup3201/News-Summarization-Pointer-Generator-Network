One method of relieving the depression of not being able to find a job might be to laugh at your own situation rather than shedding a tear.

But Jason Schneider, 26, of Queens, New York, is getting other people to chuckle in Central Park - and generating a decent income in the process.

After failed job applications to the likes of Comedy Central, Time Warner and HBO, he is making a name for himself by telling jokes for $1 a go.

Good business: After failed job applications to the likes of Comedy Central and HBO, Jason Schneider is making a name for himself by telling jokes for $1 a go

‘What do you call a seeing-eye cow for
blind people?’ he asks some people in the Manhattan park. ‘Hamburger 
helper’ is his answer.

In a
playful dig at Coca-Cola, he also jokes: ‘Scientists have found 
significant sources of water on the moon. Unfortunately it is all 
Dasani.’

He 
stands in Central Park holding a 40x30 inch sign saying ‘laughter 
guaranteed’ and has proven to be extremely popular with punters.

Mr
Schneider has been telling jokes there since April after making an 
impressive $140 in his first six hours, reported the New York Daily 
News.

He arrived in New York City four 
years ago after graduating from the University of Pennsylvania but could
only find temporary work.

Mr Schneider is so confident in the quality of his jokes that he even offers refunds and people are often seen waiting in line to hear him.

He stands next to a bench featuring a plaque engraved with a saying of writer George Plimpton: ‘When there is no wind, row’.

‘That's exactly what I'm doing because I couldn't get a job,’ Mr Schneider told the New York Daily News.

He writes around 20 jokes a day and spends four hours in Starbucks from 6am each weekday morning perfecting his puns, he added.

Some of Mr Schneider’s jokes on his website contain sexual content, but he sticks to family-friendly quips when children are listening.
