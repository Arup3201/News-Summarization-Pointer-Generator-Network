Francis could now be thrown in jail for contempt for violating the restraining order.

Francis filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February 2013. His creditors included casino mogul Steve Wynn.

Francis was  for slander for saying that Wynn had plotted to have him killed over a gambling debt from one of his casinos.

Earlier this month the Nevada Supreme Court upheld Wynn's $7.5-million judgment in a civil defamation case against Francis.

Wynn
 sued Francis in 2008 amid a legal tussle over a $2-million gambling 
debt that Francis incurred at the Wynn Las Vegas resort.

In 2012, Wynn won a $21-million judgment against Francis after a separate slander trial in Los Angeles.

Francis, who has had numerous brushes with the law in the past, blames his troubles on his 'jealous' critics.

'You
 know why I've been criticized, why I've been brutalized?' he says. 
'Anybody who criticizes me, anybody who -- it's just a jealous guy. 
Everybody who says, 'Oh, Joe Francis is this' -- look at their penis and
 tell me if it's small. Tell me!'

Last
 August Francis was sentenced to 270 days in jail and three years of 
probation after he was convicted of five charges including assault and 
the false imprisonment of three women.

Included in his sentence, Francis was supposed to complete a year of psychological counseling and anger management.
