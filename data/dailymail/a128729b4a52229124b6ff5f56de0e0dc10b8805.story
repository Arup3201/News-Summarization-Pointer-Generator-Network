A mother who had her daughters pose for sexually explicit pictures and videos before sending them to a Sydney dance teacher has been jailed until at least 2016.

The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, wept in the dock as Judge Peter Zahra described how she felt "stymied" by her own failed dance career, which began with promise but ended with strip shows and lingerie waitressing, and fell under the spell of her children's dance instructor Grant Davies.

She has pleaded guilty to producing and disseminating child abuse material, including pictures of her children in sexually suggestive poses and video of them dancing semi-naked.

Grant Davies was arrested in May last year and charged with more than 60 child abuse offences

Grant Davies was a co-director of a now defunct dance school based in Sydney's inner west

The Sydney District Court heard how the woman became engulfed by stage ambitions for her daughters, both gifted dancers, who had been accepted into Grant's exclusive Sydney dance school.

Judge Zahra said she complied with his alleged requests to supply increasingly daring images of the girls, then aged between 10 and 13.

The woman has been jailed for at least one and a half years.

Judge Zahra said the adult scenes depicted in the foreground of the images contrasted starkly with the soft toys strewn through the little girls' bedrooms, where many of the photographs were taken.

'The imagery of the complainants in sexually explicit poses against this background is confronting,' Judge Zahra said.

Some videos involved poses from dance routines while other imagery focused on the girls' genitals.

'They were particularly helpless in their own home, where the perpetrator of the abuse against them was their own mother,' the judge said.

'Because of her own obsession with fame, the offender knowingly exploited her own children.'

The court heard that after the images were discovered, the two sisters initially tried to protect their mother by pretending they had taken the photos themselves, or of one another.

The offences where allegedly committed against 10 of his dance students

But images that captured their mother's foot exposed her role in taking at least some of the pictures.

She has told the court she was scared of Davies, whom she described as domineering and aggressive, and feared that he would punish her children by kicking them out of starring roles in his company's dance productions or remove them altogether.

'I knew it wasn't right - I didn't know how to stop,' she told investigators.

'My problem is I'm not very strong.'

Yet Judge Zahra said there was evidence the offender had traded sexual banter with Davies.

'She was crazy tonight, I wish you could see them both when they are not shy,' the woman said in one text message.

'Oh my gosh, what a turn-on,' Davies is alleged to have replied.

Throughout it all, her husband has stuck by his wife, pleading with the judge during sentencing hearings not to send his wife away.

He told the judge the couple's young children were 'devastated' and "yearning" for their mother.

The woman's lawyer told reporters outside court: 'She is his wife and the mother to his children, it's a very regrettable entirely difficult situation, and yes, he stands by his wife.'

The woman was given a total sentence of three years and six months
