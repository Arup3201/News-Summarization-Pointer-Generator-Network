This is the sickening moment a teenager kicked, dragged and stamped on a helpless elderly dog.

CCTV footage captures Jordan Kearsley, 18, repeatedly beat the German shepherd, which belongs to his father, while taking it and another dog for a walk in the park.

The unemployed yob has been banned from owning animals for life, but has been spared a jail sentence for the vile attack.

Shocking: Kearsley is captured kicking the German shepherd to the ground in a vile attack on the helpless dog

Defenceless: Once the dog is down on the ground the thug kicks it again

After he has had enough, Kearsley drags the dog to force it to stand up

When Kearsley's father saw the footage, he banned his son from having any contact with the dogs again.

In the disturbing footage, Kearsley can be seen running with two dogs then kicking the female German shepherd to the ground.

Once on the floor, he then kicks it again and Blaze lies motionless on the ground.

Kearsley then drags the dog to its feet while a black Doberman on a lead stands nearby.

A few moments later he sits on a nearby bench with the two dogs.

He is filmed stroking the Doberman and then punching and pulling the defenceless German shepherd.

In another shot he is shown kicking the dog again until it falls onto the ground.

Sickeningly he then stands on it with his full weight while it is seen helplessly wriggling underneath him.

Kent Police officers were called to Gordon Promenade, in Gravesend, Kent, and Kearsley was arrested before the dogs were taken away.

Kearsley, formerly of Sutton, Kent, admitted causing unnecessary suffering to Blaze and was sentenced to 12 weeks in prison - suspended for 18 months, during a hearing on Monday.

He was also ordered to attend a probation centre and pay Â£750 costs and made the subject of a 12-week curfew, forcing him to stay at home between 8.30pm and 6am.

The RSPCA said Blaze suffered from shock and bruising, but did not have any long-lasting injuries.

RSPCA inspector Vikki Dawe said: 'This video footage was heartbreaking to see. This poor elderly dog was being kicked and stamped on. The violence was horrific.'
