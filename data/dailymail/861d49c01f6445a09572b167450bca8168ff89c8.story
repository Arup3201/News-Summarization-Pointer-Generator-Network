The parents of flesh-eating bacteria victim Aimee Copeland spoke today about their daughter's recovery just after she had started her first rehabilitation session, revealing she is determined to walk for her graduation in December.

Andy and Donna Copeland appeared on the Today show to talk about the hopes and goals of their daughter Aimee, who was finally released from hospital yesterday, two months after falling from a zip line in Augusta, Georgia.

Today the 24-year-old began her lengthy rehabilitation treatment in a clinic where she is expected to remain for six to eight weeks.

Happy: After nearly two months of battling the rare infection, called necrotizing fasciitis, Copeland was all smiles as she finally left the hospital after having four limbs amputated

Preparation: Aimee's mother Donna helped her daughter prepare for her departure from hospital after two months by putting on her makeup, left, before she posed with hospital staff, right

Her father Andy said: 'It's amazing the things we take for granted, like the ability to get up and go fix a cup of coffee and sit back down again. She has to relearn that ability, to get up and get whatever she needs to satisfy her.

'She needs to be able to have some mobility in her life again but as we speak that process has already started, she is already 30 minutes into her first rehab session.'

Aimee was pictured leaving the hospital yesterday smiling and showing off her amputated limbs as she clutched onto a doll.

She seemed happy and comfortable to pose with hospital workers as she left hospital and when she was in the ambulance.

Her mother Donna told Today: 'She was very excited when we got in the ambulance but it didn't take long before it was lights out. She fell asleep the whole way but when we got there she couldn't wait to get started, she is so motivated.'

Recovery: Aimee's mother said her daughter was motivated to go and get her rehab started as soon as possible and they hopes the clinic could also do something about the pain she is in

The 24-year-old recently revealed to her parents she wants to be able to walk again for her graduation in December.

Asked whether or not they think that is possible, Mr Copeland said: 'I believe in the power of prayer, and she is a very prayerful young lady.

'With that behind us coupled with her determination and her resolute will, I believe anything is possible.

'I think we all deal with the emotional aspect every day and I think that's where the family unit comes together as we support each other and she'll continue to need our support.

'That's why it is good she is local and she told us she wants to see us every day. There is nothing more important to us right now than the health and well-being of our daughter.

'She continues to recover and we want to continue to be there for her and I believe our presence will be a mitigated factor in her recovery.'

Aimee will spend the next six to eight weeks in a rehabilitation clinic learning to move with the aid of a wheelchair after having her left leg, right foot and both hands amputated.

Copeland's speedy recovery has defied 
doctors' initial prognosis. Her father says they at first gave her just a
slim chance of surviving. She spent weeks sedated and using a 
respirator while undergoing amputations and skin grafts to replace 
infected skin

Her father Andy spoke to msnbc about how momentous an occasion it was for Aimee to leave hospital.

'I think you could say that she's looking forward to it to the same degree that a child would look forward to leaving high school and going off to college, for her this is a major milestone.

'I would consider it a rite of passage for her as it is the opportunity that she has to actually venture out and relearn her life skills and be able to resume as normal a life as she can have.

'I believe her life can be extremely normal, whatever that word actually means. I think physically she's actually progressed rapidly, certainly far ahead of the doctor's schedule, what they thought she would do.

'I would say spiritually, mentally, psychologically she is so strong right now and for her, to actually be able to grasp the concept that she's lost her hands and feels blessed over that is an amazing thing.'

He also revealed they are in the process of making the house 'Aimee friendly' and building an extension onto it to be able to meet her needs.

The 24-year-old developed necrotizing fasciitis in a small cut she suffered after falling from a homemade zip line over a west Georgia river.

Mr Copeland wrote on his blog last week that when aimee and her family ventured outside for the first time since the accident, they reflected on the life-changing events - and Aimee showed breathtaking courage.

'I don’t have any regrets about what has happened,' Aimee told her father. 'I don’t focus on what I’ve lost, I would rather focus on what I’ve gained. I feel like I’ve been blessed.'

She went on: 'I am blessed to have the opportunity to experience something that not many other people have the chance to experience.

Upbeat: On a blog, Aimee's father has said he is amazed by her courage and determination to walk

'I am blessed to have the capacity to 
share my experience with others and have a chance to improve the quality
of someone else's life. I’m blessed to be different.'

Speaking to GMA, her father spoke of her determination to walk at her Master's graduation ceremony this December. 'You heard the word right,' he said. 'Walk. That's what she intends to do.'

Earlier this month, Mr Copeland said his daughter had been enduring the worst pain of the ordeal. Her agony was so overwhelming that she began taking morphine after initially refusing medication.

The
student had originally indicated that she felt a 'traitor to her 
convictions' by using drugs to manage her pain, because she believed in 
holistic medicine.

Injuries: Aimee had her left leg, right foot and both hands amputated. She also lost part of her torso

She also suffered phantom pains. Mr Copeland wrote: 'Although she has no hands, her brain
is apparently still telling her body that the hands are there.

'I asked 
her if she could describe the pain and she told me, "It feels like I 
have been carrying bags of rocks".'

The
University of West Georgia student had to have multiple amputations to save her life 
after the small cut to her leg became infected.

The bacteria that attacked her wound released a toxin that destroys skin, muscle and a layer
of tissue below the skin known as fascia, her father said.

Aimee has 
improved incredibly rapidly with the support of her family and 
well-wishers who have made donations on the website Mr Copeland set up 
for his brave daughter.

Mr
Copeland wrote that support Aimee has come from all over the US, including from celebrities like Sophia Vergara, Katie Couric and 
Ann Curry.

Less than a month ago, doctors gave her
little chance of survival, but she became increasingly alert, despite 
several major operations, but she is likely to remain hospitalised for several more months.

'This
doctor can't fathom a reason for why she's improved the way she has,' 
Mr Copeland said. 'Her spirits are extraordinarily high. I am absolutely
amazed.'
