Frank de Boer and Mauricio Pochettino are locked in a straight fight to become the latest manager of Tottenham.

Spurs chairman Daniel Levy, who fired Tim Sherwood at the end of the season, is expected to make a final decision within the next 48 hours. 

On Sunday night Pochettino was the marginal favourite as Levy prepares to make another managerial appointment.

De Boer's hopes have been raised again despite his controversial outburst following his fourth successive Eredivisie triumph with Ajax.

The Dutchman was openly critical of Tottenham's handling of their recruitment process when he discovered he was among a number of candidates.

De Boer has the pedigree after a phenomenal start to his managerial career in Holland and has also worked with Spurs' star midfielder Christian Eriksen.

De Boer wants the Tottenham job and Levy has promised he will make a decision this week.

Pochettino's representatives have also persuaded Levy that the Southampton manager could be ready to make the step up to one of English football's top clubs.

He has been involved in a series of talks with Saints aimed at keeping him at St Mary's, but he has yet to make a decision. 

Levy, coming under increasing pressure to make an appointment, is ready to make his final move within the next two days.

Tottenham had also spoken to former Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini about the job but the Italian is not now a contender.

Mancini is currently in Turkey with Galatasaray and has just finished his first season in Istanbul by winning the domestic cup.

The 49-year-old is looking for a return to the Barclays Premier League and was very keen on the job at White Hart Lane. Mancini feels he has unfinished business in England after being sacked by City just over a year ago.
