Controversial: India's first handgun for women

The first handgun for women has gone on sale in India, but it has come under fire for being named after the Delhi rape victim.

The model is called Nirbheek, meaning bold or intimidated, in tribute to the 23-year-old student gang-raped in December 2012, who was named in the Indian media as Nirbhaya, or ‘fearless’, while reporting restrictions on naming rape victims were in place.

However, Binalakshmi Nepram, founder of the Manipur Women Gun Survivors Network, strongly objected to the weapon, which is made by the Indian Ordnance Factory (IOF) in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, an arm of the country’s Ministry of Defence.

She told The Independent that it was ‘an abhorrence to [the Delhi student’s] memory’.

She added: ‘Our work over the past 10 years has shown that if a woman involved in an incident has a gun on her person she is 12 times more likely to be killed.’

The .32 bore gun costs R122,360 (£1,203) – or roughly a third of the average yearly salary for an Indian worker.

It’s made from titanium-alloy and IOF says it’s already had about 80 formal enquiries about it.

Victim Jyoti Singh Pandey died on December 29 2012 in a specialist hospital in Singapore after a 13-day struggle to survive injuries so grievous that her intestines had to be removed.

She was attacked as she and a male friend made their way home from the cinema in New Delhi. The assault was carried out by several men, who violated her with an iron bar.

She underwent three major surgeries - including one to remove her intestines - and suffered a cardiac arrest in India before being flown to Singapore for treatment.

The brutal case caused uproar in India, with mass demonstrations for women's rights, tougher rape laws and calls for the suspects in the case to be hanged.
