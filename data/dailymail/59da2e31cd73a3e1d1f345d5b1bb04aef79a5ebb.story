Miraculous recovery: Ex-England batsman John Edrich claims he recovered from cancer thanks to extracts of mistletoe

An international cricket career that spanned two decades, he won a reputation as a dogged and fearless batsman.

Now, John Edrich is applying the same determination to fighting cancer – with a little help from mistletoe.

The opening batsman, who played 77 tests for England between 1963 and 1976, has credited the experimental tumour treatment with saving his life.

Edrich was given just seven years to live when he was diagnosed with a rare blood cancer in 2000. His health deteriorated so badly by 2005 that he told his wife Judith he was on the brink of death.

Shortly afterwards, he heard about Stefan Geider, an Aberdeen GP who uses injections of mistletoe extract as a cancer treatment.

He has never looked back. The 75-year-old is on the golf course three times a week and says he feels on top of the world.

Speaking from his home in Ballater, Aberdeenshire, Mr Edrich said: ‘My quality of life was grim. I said to my wife, Judith, “This is the end”. I was so tired and lethargic, I couldn’t do anything. Then three or four days later a friend of a friend rang me and said I had to see Dr Geider because his treatment had worked wonders with another patient.

There is some evidence that compounds found in mistletoe can have an effect on cancer cells, but there is little concrete proof of its value as a treatment at present.

Scientists claim extracts from the plant:

The use of mistletoe extract is 
widespread in Europe, particularly in Germany, but the third mistletoe 
symposium in that country - reported on in the British Medical Journal - detailed a long 
list of possible side effects from mistletoe, from nausea to herpes.

The issue is also confused by the fact that mistletoe is sometimes used as a homeopathic remedy - which is never recommended as a key treatment for any type of cancer.

‘When I went along, I asked him whether he thought I could really get better and he said “You will be all right, John”.

‘The difference now is incredible. Mistletoe is not the final cure, but whatever is inside it certainly helped me. Without it, I don’t think I would be here today.’

Mistletoe has been touted as a cancer treatment since the 1920s and experiments show it can kill cancer cells in the lab. Doubts remain however about how effective it is in the human body.

Dr Geider said that in some cases injections of the plant can help shrink tumours.

Other patients seem to benefit from a better quality of life, more energy or a healthier appetite.

The doctor, who is to carry out a clinical trial of the treatment on breast cancer patients, said: ‘Mistletoe has to my experience helped a lot of patients tremendously.

‘But it does not work for everybody – it’s not a miracle cure. We need to find out why the mistletoe works for some people, and not for others – that’s why we need the trials.’

Professor Steven Heys, an Aberdeen University cancer specialist who will help run the trial, told the BBC: ‘There isn’t any evidence that mistletoe does have an anti-cancer effect, in terms of prolonging the life of patients.

‘What it does do, possibly, is improve the quality of life of patients with breast cancer who are having chemotherapy.

‘Therefore I think it’s important to look and evaluate that and study it, in very good randomised controlled trials, conducted in a very controlled setting.’

Mr Edrich was diagnosed with Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia in 2000. ‘I hadn’t seen a doctor for about ten years, but I’d been feeling tired for a while,’ he said.

‘Having taken blood tests they discovered leukaemia. It was quite a shock. You can’t fight it.

‘I think we’ve got to be grateful for what we’ve had. I did something which I loved and had the ability to play cricket at the highest level.’

Mr Edrich’s fearlessness on the pitch saw him twice returning to the wicket to bat during the 1974-5 Ashes tour despite having his hand and later ribs broken by balls from Australian fast bowler Dennis Lillee.

He comes from a famous Norfolk sporting family and four of his cousins played first-class cricket.

A scorer of 12 centuries for England, his best effort was 310 not out against New Zealand in 1965.

There is still scepticism in the UK, however
