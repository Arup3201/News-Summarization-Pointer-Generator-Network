It was only a small-sided game at the end of a session at Arsenal’s London Colney training ground, but heads were turned when teenage striker Chuba Akpom, called over to join them, cut in from the left flank and curled the ball, side-footed, around the goalkeeper to score.

The move echoed a former time and a former forward, as if the ghost of Thierry Henry was still haunting the centre’s pitches with his trademark dribble and finish. 

Alexis Sanchez came running over to Akpom, leaping around excitedly and shouting ‘Titi, Titi, Titi, Titi!’

There is still a long, long way to go until the 19-year-old gets anywhere near close to his idol Henry, but nicknames tend to stick around.

‘One day in training with the first team I scored an Henry-type goal, cutting inside and finishing,’ Akpom tells Sportsmail.

‘I could see Sanchez jumping, he’ s an enthusiastic guy at the best of times and he’s going: “Titi, Titi, Titi, Titi!” ‘The next morning he came to me and said “Titi.” 

'Then the next morning he came to me and said “Titi.” I asked: 'hold on is this my new nickname?' That’s how it came about and it’s stuck since then.

‘Now the lads just call me Titi or Thierry Henry - I’ll take that. It’s not a bad comparison to have.

‘He was my idol growing up. Playing for the academy and watching Arsenal’s first team I used to see players like Henry scoring every week and it really inspired me.’

Akpom was born and bred in east London’s Canning Town and joined Arsenal aged six.

Manager Arsene Wenger has been so impressed with his progress the Frenchman has him training with the first team and has included him regularly on the bench this season, featuring several times in the Premier League and FA Cup. 

Even if the Henry comparisons are premature, there is no denying Akpom is beginning to make his mark where it matters. ‘I’m with the senior team now in the changing room and on the training ground,’ he adds.

‘It’s all about getting familiar with the environment and the players and getting as much game time as I can.

‘A lot of them are international players, a lot are England players; Calum Chambers, Jack Wilshere, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Theo Walcott, Danny Welbeck, Kieran Gibbs. I look up to them. 

'They’ve made it into the England senior team. It’s good to be around them and get good advice.’ 

Akpom is a right-footed front man but likes to drop out wide to the left flank to torment full-backs. 

Sound familiar? His is quick and skilful with a sharp finish. Most importantly, he scores goal. For Arsenal youth teams and England Under 15 to Under 20 level, bucketfuls of them.

‘People keep telling me having a child is the best feeling,’ he says. ‘I haven’ t had that yet I’m too young, but when I score goals - I’d be surprised if you beat that feeling.’

He cites one of the game’s greatest goal-scorers, the Brazilian Ronaldo, as another idol and closer to home is aiming at the top.

But, unlike the lightning runs down the left wing, he understands all of that will come slowly.

‘Wayne Rooney is another player I look up to,’ he explains. ‘He’s the captain of the national team and that’s something I would like to try to do.

‘I’d love to be a captain - of England and Arsenal. Leading by example off the pitch and on it. It would be a dream.

‘Right now, it’s about getting in the squad first. You look at Luke Shaw, see him go to the World Cup last summer, it shows you how fast things can change.

‘Raheem Sterling is a good friend of mine, Ross Barkley; young players are getting their chance. But now it’s about taking it step-by-step. There’s no rush.’
