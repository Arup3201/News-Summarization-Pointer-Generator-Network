Thirteen years ago, on my 60th birthday, I decided to go clothes shopping. It's not a pastime I've ever particularly enjoyed, finding it boringly time-consuming, but my husband Michael is always encouraging me to treat myself, so off I went.

I'd been feeling a little low about hitting this particular milestone birthday. Not many women like the sound of 'sixtysomething'.

But as I fingered the rails at the British Designers Sale, a fantastic London-based club who hold a  knock-down sale at Chelsea Town Hall, I spotted them almost immediately. There they were - tight-fitting snakeskin trousers, the sort that would look more at home on a Kate (Moss) or a Victoria (Beckham).

Daring to wear: Sandra in dungarees and a patterned dress as she has become more bold in her 70s

Certainly not the sort one would associate with a sexagenarian.

But I had not come shopping with the intention of allowing age to let me slip into sartorial obscurity. I had come to make a statement, and I would be making it with leather, printed leather.

They slid on and fitted perfectly and, after a cursory check of my rear view using my trusted compact mirror, I handed over £100 - far more than I am usually comfortable spending on a single item, but what the hell!

I showed them to my husband who thought they were great fun, and I felt on top of the world.

I couldn't help but smile. And I smiled again when I saw 55-year-old Emma Thompson on the red carpet last week, positively radiating confidence. Arriving at the premiere of her new film Walking On Sunshine in a vibrant red dress and patterned scarf, she was anything but conventional - but she looked glorious.

Approval: Sandra's husband Michael Howard is a fan of her fun fashion choices

Oscar-winner Emma tends to play rather prim roles. This outfit was anything but. Cut down to the ankles, it looked feminine and the scarf was cut on the bias, adding an even more eccentric feel.

She teamed those with a multi-coloured chain necklace and patent bronze heels, as well as black glasses. Her blonde hair was scraped back off her face.

As she shot the photographers a wide grin and then went to greet her fans, I thought she looked marvellous.

It's not that long ago that women of a certain age had to conform to a rigid style canon which set out skirt length (below the knee)  and appropriate evening wear (never trousers).

My own mother, like most wartime women, wore the same clothes all her life - plain wool skirt, plain blouse or jumper. It was simply expected. Now, things are different.

We can wear jeans to red carpet events. Clashing colours are considered stylish. Why shouldn't that freedom extend to women over 50?

Since that day with the snakeskin trousers, I look for clothes that make me stand out. Rifling through my drawers you'll find a pair of shocking pink sunglasses bought in Spain for one euro that I wear all the time.

Fab fashionistas: Sandra admired Emma Thompson's recent red carpet look, left, and always thinks Judi Dench looks good

There are emerald green jeans by Apanage I bought at the Designer Sale. I wear them to all kinds of events, including cruises.

I have sparkly white jeans and a splashy LK Bennett black-and-white dress I wear for book talks. It never fails to make me feel wonderful - especially when I team it with bright orange toenails.

It seems that I'm in great company when it comes to shattering convention in my later years.

Judi Dench, who is nearing 80, looks terrific in everything. Although Helena Bonham Carter is a mere 48, I can't imagine her clothes will become any less outrageous as she hits her 50s.

Indeed, many of my friends believe that fashion gets more fun as you get older. I have one incredible barrister friend in her 60s who regularly wears sparkly cowboy boots and wild headbands.

Another friend, Rosa Monckton, is instinctively stylish and throws together wonderfully exotic and original clothes.

Of course there are moments when I think, 'Oh... dear.'

But if I'm in doubt, I canvass the opinion of one of my two sons, Sholto, 51, or Nick, 38. They either say: 'Yes, mum you look great', or 'No, you can't be seen in that'. I'm happy to discard something on  their advice.

It might seem like a double standard, but the key - I believe - to carrying off an outrageous look is feeling confident. And that means knowing when to say no.

Accessorise: Sandra got lots of compliments when she wore this chunky necklace recently

When I was 70, I did a shoot for a woman's magazine and they produced a pair of really tight skinny jeans. I said I couldn't possibly wear them as they'd make my hips look huge.

The stylists then produced a long flowing grey top and a crocheted silver-threaded cardigan to lay over them - and I felt incredible.

There are times when I hold back. There comes a point in every woman's life where your upper knees and arms are no longer a thing of beauty and there's nothing you can do about it.

Many is the time I've tried on a sleeveless dress or a skirt that is just a little too short and it's come straight off again. But even then, when a style has really suited me, I've broken my own rules. I've got a fantastic black leather dress which I adore and that has no sleeves.  

Jeans can be particularly cruel, so when you find a pair that suit, treasure them. I have several.

There is another myth about fashion and growing older. Some women claim that they no longer need to dress to impress, but to that I say, poppycock! We still want to turn a head or two,  even though we can claim a  bus pass.

Some people might accuse me of being disingenuous. Being a slim size 10 - or a size 12 on some days - and a former fashion model means I've always been a bit of a clothes horse.

But that's missing the point. I know plenty of people who are wide, small, fat, thin and can wear wonderfully outrageous clothes. It's not about size.

My advice to any woman wanting to break the fashion mould is to start off small, perhaps by accessorising an outfit with some offbeat clunky jewellery and just see how many compliments you pick up.

Michael is always buying me bits of over-sized jewellery. I wore a fabulous chunky colourful necklace to the Costa Book Awards recently and so many people told me how terrific it looked.

Focus on your best feature. I have a small waist so wear clothes that show that off. But I hate my legs and prefer to draw attention away from those - wearing cut-off trousers with orange toenails peeping through distracts wonderfully.

Get your colours 'done'. I went to a charity coffee morning a few years ago where a few friends and I had it done and was told that I suited zingy oranges and brilliant yellows. I could immediately see the difference, these colours 'lifted' me and I wear them regularly now.

But most of all, be brave. When you look in the mirror and you're not sure if those jeans or that top are suitable for your age, say  those four magic words 'To hell with it' and walk out into the world.

I promise, you'll look fantastic - just like Emma!
