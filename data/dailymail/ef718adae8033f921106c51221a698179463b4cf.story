A Sydney radio presenter has been dumped from a guest spot on 2GB radio after he called the prophet Mohammed a pedophile.

Michael Smith had been booked to present Chris Smith's afternoon program on 2GB for three weeks starting on Monday.

But the former 2UE presenter claimed on his website that 2GB's program director David Kidd phoned him on Friday night and said he wouldn't be needed because 'you can't call a Deity a pedophile'.

Michael Smith had been booked to present Chris Smith's afternoon program on 2GB for three weeks starting on Monday but claims he was told he was no longer needed after controversial comments made on Thursday

Smith's controversial comments came during a regular guest spot with 2GB host Ben Fordham on Thursday.

'The prophet Mohammad was a pedophile, a pederast, a sexual offender, a man who promoted the idea that it was okay to marry a six-year-old and consummate the marriage when the little girl was nine,' he said.

'And that's written into their books, it's part of the philosophy… the Koran. It's factually correct.'

Smith pointed out that he'd made similar comments on 2UE in 2011 and had been acquitted of a complaint of inciting hatred and of factual inaccuracy by the Australian Communications and Media Authority.

The pair were discussing the recent controversy over a talk the Festival of Dangerous Ideas had booked and later cancelled at the Sydney Opera House with a Muslim activist on whether honour killings could be morally justified.

Smith implied activist Uthman Badar's invitation to speak at the festival was similar to asking the leader of the Ku Klux Klan to speak.

The comments sparked a barrage of calls from angry listeners, including a very emotional man named Mohammad who hung up after telling Smith his comments were 'ridiculous'.

'What the heck do you think you're adding to the debate when you call the prophet, peace be upon him, a pedophile?' the listener said.

2GB presenter Ray Hadley also criticised Smith's comments during his show on Friday morning.

'I value the worth of this station in the community and sometimes I've been guilty of tarnishing its reputation and for that I've apologised,' Hadley said.

'I want to go on record today and completely distance myself from Mr Smith's comments as well. Yesterday I was insulted by what was said… and I've got to speak out against it. It's not about stifling speech, it's about being fair and decent.'

Smith said on his website he stood by his comments.

'I've thought about what I said in answer to Ben's question. I think it's wrong for a man in his 50s to have sex with a 9 year old child. It is wrong, it's a crime and it should be called out for what it is,' he wrote.

'I know Ray Hadley disagrees with me - perhaps Ray could let us know what part of a grown man having sex with a 9 year old girl is right?'

Despite criticism from 2GB radio veteran Ray Hadley, Mr Smith Smith said on his website he stood by his comments
