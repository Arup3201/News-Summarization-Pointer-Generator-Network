The single currency crashed to its lowest level for nearly two years last night as Brussels warned that the eurozone faces ‘financial disintegration’.

In a hard-hitting report on the dire state of the economy, the European Commission called for drastic action to prevent catastrophe tearing the region apart.

It proposed that money set aside for keeping debt-ridden governments afloat should now be used to rescue troubled European banks.

Disintegration: The single currency crashed to its lowest level for nearly two years last night

‘Flexibility and speed are of the essence,’ said EC president Jose Manuel Barroso.

The desperate rallying cry came amid mounting fears that the banking crisis in Spain will cripple the eurozone’s fourth largest economy and trigger a cataclysmic break-up of the single currency.

The euro crashed below $1.24 against the US dollar to a level not seen for nearly two years.

The single currency was also trading below 80p against the pound having lost 20 per cent of its value in the last three years.

‘The market has lost confidence in the euro,’ said Carl Forcheski, a currency expert at French bank Societe Generale in New York. ‘People are battening down the hatches.’

Stock markets around the world were on the slide with the FTSE 100 index down 1.74 per cent or 93.86 points to 5297.28 on a punishing day for investors in London.

Chris Beauchamp, a market analyst at IG Index in the City, said: ‘Without wishing to sound apocalyptic, it does feel as if Spain is gradually shuffling towards the abyss.

‘Investor confidence wanes by the day, and it could only be a matter of time before the Spanish government is forced to ask for financial aid.

‘This would be an event of a far greater magnitude than the bailouts of Ireland, Portugal and Greece, since Spain’s size means it would exhaust Europe’s financial firepower.’

The EC said the eurozone bailout fund could be used to help banks directly rather than fund governments. It said it could ease pressure on countries such as Spain struggling to prop up the banking system.

‘To sever the link between banks and the sovereigns, direct recapitalisation might be envisaged,’ the report said.

The money would come from the European Stability Mechanism, the eurozone’s permanent bailout fund which launches in July but is currently only designed to lend to governments.

Brussels said: ‘A closer integration among the euro area countries in supervisory structures and practices, in cross-border crisis management and burden sharing, towards a ‘banking union’ would be an important complement to the current structure.’

It also floated the idea of Eurobonds - a move that would see debt issued jointly by all 17 countries in the eurozone.

The idea is vehemently opposed in Berlin because it would involve German taxpayers underwriting Greek and Spanish debt.
