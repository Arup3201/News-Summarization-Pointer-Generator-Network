What's in a name? Henry Cornish, 11, winner of the open savoury junior category at the World Pasty Championships in Cornwall

What's in a name? Quite a lot, it turns out â€“ at least when it comes to pasty making.

Two brothers named Cornish have followed in their father's footsteps and triumphed at the World Pasty Championships.

Henry Cornish, 14, won the open savoury junior category at the second annual event, held at the Eden Project in Cornwall.

And his 11-year-old brother, Simon, came second in the Cornish pasty junior category.

Their father Graham was crowned the winner in both the Cornish pasty and open savoury professional categories last year.

Henry, of Launceston, Cornwall, said: 'I'm a bit surprised to be honest, I wasn't really expecting it because I entered just for fun but I'm really happy.

'My dad winning last year opened up my eyes so I thought that I would have a go this year.

'I did a pizza pasty because I absolutely love pizza so I thought why don't I try and make it into a pasty.'

More than 125 professional and amateur bakers competed on Saturday and the winners across eight categories were announced at a ceremony dubbed the 'Oggy Oscars'.

Defending champion Billy Deakin, from Mount Hawke, Cornwall, regained the champion spot in the Cornish pasty amateur category.

He said: 'It feels great to win, last year it was a bit of a surprise but this year I really wanted to win.

'I made the same pasty I always make at home and the judges obviously liked it as much as I do.'

The championships also included pasty making workshops and demonstrations, with pop singer and cookery writer Paul Young among the special guests.

Cornwall-born Mike Amery, who had flown from Pennsylvania, U.S., for the competition was presented with a special pasty ambassador award.

Last year, Cornish pasties were given Protected Geographical Indication status by the European Commission.

The status means only pasties made within the county are allowed to be labelled 'Cornish Pasty'.

It followed a nine-year campaign by trade organisation, Cornish Pasty Association, which is made up of more than 50 pasty makers in Cornwall.

Members of the association are estimated as being responsible for around six per cent of the area's food economy.

Although its origins remain unclear, the pasty is first thought to have become popular in Cornwall in the 17th Century, with tin miners finding the food easy to carry and reheat, and eat without cutlery.
