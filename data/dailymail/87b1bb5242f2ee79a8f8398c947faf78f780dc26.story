While Liverpool's season slowly fizzling out, defender Jose Enrique ensured his weekend went off with more of a bang by celebrating Bonfire Night early.

The Spanish full-back was joined by his girlfriend Amy Jaine and her pals in what appears to be his back garden  - where the group marvelled at the joy of watching a few sparklers.

Jaine's friends even posted an Instagram video of the low rent pyrotechnics show - while another offered a picture of the girls in all their dazzling glory, with the caption 'Amazing night, amazing company! Thank you AmyJaine & Jesanchez3 A shot of sparkler fun with the girls x'.

Despite being sidelined for most of the season through injury, Enrique has travelled with the squad to Spain where Liverpool face Real Madrid at the Bernabeu on Tuesday.

Having lost their last two games in the competition, Brendan Rodgers is considering prioritising Saturday's Premier League clash with Chelsea by resting several stars.

Captain Steven Gerrard could be the biggest casualty should Rodgers decide to take a gamble, while England youngster Raheem Sterling could also be left out.
