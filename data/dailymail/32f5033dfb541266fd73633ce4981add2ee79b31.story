Alvaro Arbeloa caused a stir when he turned up for Real Madrid training in an unusual vehicle - a classic Morgan 3 Wheeler.

Supercars are the norm for professional footballers, but arriving at training for the Spanish giants in a classic British three-wheeler is anything but conventional.

The Morgan 3 Wheeler was re-released in 2011 by the Worcestershire-based company and is an extremely rare car. Fans rushed up to the car to be photographed with the 31-year-old defender.
