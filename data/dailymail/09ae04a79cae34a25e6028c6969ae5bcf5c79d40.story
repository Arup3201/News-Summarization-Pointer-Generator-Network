A woman has shared the shocking story of how she was sexually abused by her father and had his baby when she was a teenager.

Helen Rees (not her real name) agreed to appear on today's This Morning and be interviewed by presenters Phillip Schofield and Christine Bleakley on the condition she would not be identified.

Speaking to them with her face turned away from the cameras, she revealed how she and her younger sister and older brother grew up In Ireland in fear of their father.

Their mother had left them, leaving them with the 'frightening' man who had mental health issues.

She said: 'I saw him as a very dark figure, very frightening. I could hear him talking to himself a lot, he was crazy, he thought the house was bugged.'

Helen said he treated his son and daughters 'like animals'. They had no bedding and only ate bread and potatoes while he had 'fancy food'.

He would torment them by buying pick n' mix sweets and eating them in front of them.

But his abuse was also far more violent and sinister than that.  

Helen recalled: 'There was a lot of physical abuse, he would hit us with poker, a belt, or with a branch on the back of our legs. My sister and I dressed like old women in long skirts to hide the bruises. Sometimes he would force our brother to beat us.'

Helen said she was just five years old when the abuse became sexual and her father started visiting her at night.

'He was the boss, I didn't know any different,' she said. 

She said she was too scared to tell anyone what was happening.

'He warned me "if you lose me, you'll be locked up in an institution and the key will be thrown away",' she explained.

Don't suffer in silence: Helen is urging other victims to speak out

As a result, Helen endured the abuse for years. Then at the age of 14, she was stunned to discover she was pregnant.

'He told me I couldn't get pregnant because he was my father. I believed that, it was such a shock,' she said when she found out she was expecting.

'I didn't know what was going on. He shouted at me and said "why didn't you take precautions?"' she said of her father's reaction.

He tried to arrange for her to have abortion but by the time Helen realised she was pregnant, it was too late for a termination. 

When her daughter, Sarah, arrived, Helen said she was her 'pride and joy.' 

But because she was still 14 and they had nowhere to go, she had to take her baby back to live with her father.

It was when she saw him acting suspiciously with the child that she knew she had to get them both away from him.  

I went out and came back to see him with the baby, her nappy was open, he was rubbing his hands together and he looked guilty, "what are you doing?" I shouted at him. I knew then I had to get out of there, I thought "could this really happen to a little baby?"'

She reported her father for what he had done to her but he was deemed unfit to stand trial because of his mental health. He was put into psychiatric care until he died.

Helen tried her best to move on and give her daughter a happy life. She never intended to tell Sarah the truth about who her father was - but she found out when she was a teenager after she discovered hidden paperwork relating to her grandfather.

Discovering the truth led to her feeling betrayed by her mother.

'For a period, she hated me,' Helen said. 'She shut down and stopped dealing with her emotions.'

Helen wonders if things would had been different if she had told Sarah the truth earlier. 

Their relationship is slowly improving and Sarah is happier and travelling the world.

Speaking of why she has chosen to share her story, Helen said she hopes it will encourage other victims to speak out sooner than she did.  

'Tell someone, get it out there,' she urged. 'Don't live with abuse and remember it's not your fault.'
