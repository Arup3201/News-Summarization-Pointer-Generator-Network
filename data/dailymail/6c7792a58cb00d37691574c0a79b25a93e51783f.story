Dina Asher-Smith called it ‘the best day of my life’. The 18-year-old found out she had got the A-level results required to read history at King’s College.

Then she broke the British 200m junior record to sail into tonight’s European Championships final, where a medal is a distinct possibility. The only downside was missing out on a dance in Tiger Tiger nightclub.

‘I really couldn’t have asked for much more,’ she said, ‘definitely the best day of my life and I’m going into the final fit and I feel I can go faster than I did as I slowed down at the end.’

Asher-Smith lowered her personal best by a stunning 0.13sec to 22.61sec, finishing second in the semi-final behind France’s Myriam Soumare, who is nine years her senior. Asher-Smith will be joined in the final by Bianca Williams and 20-year-old Jodie Williams, who eased down to win her heat in 22.90sec.

As her friends gathered at Newstead Wood School in Orpington, Kent, to collect their exam results, Asher-Smith spent a frustrating journey from the team hotel to Zurich’s Letzigrund Stadium failing to check her own results online.

‘I couldn’t get logged on,’ she said, ‘so my mum texted me that I had got into King’s and I was like, “Yippee!” I don’t know exactly what I got but I needed three As so somewhere around there.’

Despite her exploits, Asher-Smith was confident she would get a good night’s sleep ahead of the final. Meanwhile, her friends in London were planning to celebrate their exam results with a night out.

‘I’m just going to have an early night,’ she said, ‘Most of my friends are going to Tiger Tiger, the nightclub. I know I’ll get loads of photos saying, “Oh my gosh, look what I was wearing?” and I’ll be like, “Great, remember to tune into TV this evening”.’

Finish: The 18-year-old crosses the line ahead of Hanna-Maari Latvala and Yekaterina Vukolova

Last month Asher-Smith became 100m world junior champion in Oregon. Now she is planning how to balance university life and training sessions with her coach John Blackie in Bromley.

Another academic in the team, William Sharman, won Great Britain’s eighth medal with silver in the 110m hurdles. 

Sharman was unsure whether he had won a medal more than a minute after he crossed the line as officials deliberated over a four-way photo finish. 

The big screen finally revealed he had snatched second place by the length of his buzz cut. Sharman, a classically trained pianist, was leading until the penultimate hurdle when Russian Sergey Shubenkov produced a late surge to win in 13.13sec. 

Sharman, who has a degree in economics, timed his dip perfectly to take silver in 13.27sec. France’s Thomas Martinot-Lagarde took bronze in 13.38sec.

‘It’s mixed emotions because I knew I was in the lead,’ said Sharman. ‘I could have done more and that’s why I was gutted.’
