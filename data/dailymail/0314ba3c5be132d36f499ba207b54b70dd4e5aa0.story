It's not easy finding a campsite with a river view, but the owner of this caravan may have taken things a bit far.

The vehicle reversed straight over a grassy bank and into the water behind a motorway service station.

The stranded caravan was spotted today near the M5 in Gloucestershire by photographer Adrian Sherratt - who said its owner may have been stopping for a cup of coffee.

Carry on reversing: This caravan's owner may have been a bit too keen to get a river view behind a service station on the M5 in Gloucestershire. Photographer Adrian Sherratt said: 'People park up for a flask of coffee'

Picnic gone wrong? The caravan was left dangling precariously with one corner in the Little Avon river

The 44-year-old saw the vehicle in the Little Avon river next to a tiny, single-track lane between Michael Wood services on the M5 and the village of Stone.

'You get people who park up to have a flask of coffee and just look at the water,' he said.

'It looks like someone's been passing and got a bit too close to the edge.

'It could've been stolen or fly-tipped but I don't know why someone would go to all the effort to get it into the river.'

Mr Sherratt, from nearby 
Wotton-under-Edge, added: 'I'm surprised they managed it because it's 
been very dry since the floods. The bank shouldn't have been too 
slippery for them.

Shall I leave it here? The caravan was abandoned hanging partly into the river and with the door left open

'There are a lot of farm vehicles that go along there so it may also have crashed by backing up and trying to let something past.'

Stroud District Council has been told about the caravan and was preparing to remove it, he added.
