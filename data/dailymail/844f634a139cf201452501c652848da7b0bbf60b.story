The front row may have been the worst place to be at Rick Owens' Paris menswear show today.

The designer - who's been dubbed #d***owens by Twitter wags - sent men down the catwalk out in loose hanging, draped smocks with one very particular detail - groin peepholes,  treating fashion fans to the sight of model manhood in all its glory - as part of his autumn/winter 2015 show.

While for some of the gentlemen the outfits sat so low their modesty was protected, others weren't so lucky and one chap wore a top which, due to the unfortunate crotch-level cropping, gave the world an X-rated eyeful.

This model did not seem that happy to have his penis on show to the whole world today at the Rick Owens show in Paris 

Male models at the Rick Owens show turned heads for more than just their clothes, draped gowns with cut-out crotches revealed all 

No sooner had the show ended than many fashion fans took to Twitter to express their excitement and amusement at the outfits which were thought to have been inspired by religious robes. 

One user said: 'I bet more than height and waist measurements were taken at the Rick Owens casting.'

Another quipped: 'Immediate reaction to the Rick Owens crotch cutouts: that male model's mom is going to be placing a VERY stern phone call.' 

Fashion editors were quick to review the show with New York Magazine saying: 'Just as 2014 was the year of the butt, 2015 is shaping up to be about the bulge in fashion land.' 

However they said many of the attendees missed the big moment because they were too busy on their phones: 'The penises weren't the point of the show - it was blink-and-you-miss-it - but many editors were cursing themselves afterward for missing them because they were too busy texting.'

For some of the models the outfits were long enough that they covered their modesty - others weren't so lucky

Some of the attendees at the show said that you could blink and miss the full frontal male nudity that took place at the show

And fashion blogger Susie Bubble didn't seem to think the outfits were that big of a deal. She told Dazed And Confused: 'I liked that you hardly noticed it. It wasn't nudity for the sake of nudity. I honestly didn't see until somebody pointed out the d*** flaps and the undie holes.' 

Many people took to Instagram to repost the pictures which quickly went viral, sharing them under the hashtag #d**kowens, a play on the California-born designer's name. 

Many Twitter users took to the social media site to express their amusement at the Rick Owens show in Paris today 

According to fashion insiders at the show there were a total of three penises in the show although to what degree they were seen varied depending on the model. 

Rick's show and his penis peephole outfits are the latest in a long line of bizarre offerings which have taken place during the men's fashion weeks. In London models walked down the catwalk with lego stuck to their faces.

While not all of the models showed off their whole bodies it seems that wearing underwear will be a definite no-no this autumn

And at the house of Christopher Shannon they were photographed coming down the runway with plastic bags on their heads and others had the same emblazoned on their jumpers.

At the DSquared2 show and Salvatore Ferragamo in Milan it was all about giant winter warmers. While DSquared controversially showed giant fur hats and huge lined coats, Ferragamo had models walk down the runway in giant scarfs. 

At the Gucci show men were dressed in very feminine outfits including lace tops, pussybow blouses and vests.
