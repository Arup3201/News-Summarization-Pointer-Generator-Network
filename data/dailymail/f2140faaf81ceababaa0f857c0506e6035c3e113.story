The end of the cold spell finally arrived today as the sun started to shine, and forecasters have said temperatures could be about to rise even further.

Sunday is expected to be the warmest day of 2013 so far, with temperatures reaching as high as 20C in parts, although they will fall again by the start of next week to what would be expected for this time of year.

But while many took advantage of the warmer temperatures and enjoyed some sunshine today, forecasters have warned rain will spread across the UK as the weather remains 'mild but a bit unsettled' over the next few days.

People were able to enjoy the spring sunshine on the River Cam, in Cambridge, today, but forecasters have said the weather will remain 'unsettled' until the weekend

Charlie Powell, forecaster for the 
Met Office, said: 'It hasn't been too bad today for a lot of places, 
particularly western Scotland and north west England - temperatures have
got up to double figures.

Rare
birds have been found dead in the latest sign of wildlife struggling to
cope with the cold spring, conservationists have said.

The
bodies of eight stone curlews, a threatened species which migrates from
wintering grounds in Africa and Spain in the spring, have been found in
fields in Wiltshire, Norfolk and Suffolk in the past few days.

Conservation
charity the RSPB said the birds are believed to have struggled to find 
food on their arrival to the UK and were just two-thirds the weight they
should have been if they were healthy.

Only around 400 stone curlew pairs are in the UK, and the last two years have been poor for breeding.

The
discovery of eight dead birds, with the actual number that have died 
likely to be higher, is a stark reminder of how fragile the species is, 
RSPB conservation director Martin Harper said.

Hundreds
of puffins and other seabirds were found dead two weeks ago off the 
coast of Scotland and north-east England, as a result of freezing 
conditions and stormy weather making it hard to find food.

Nature
enthusiasts are reporting little evidence of the annual influx of 
summer migrants which normally arrive at this time of year to build 
nests and breed.

Reports of chiffchaffs, willow warblers and black caps have been scarce.

'That kind of marks the change to a fairly significant change of weather type as we head into the next few weeks.

'Admittedly, for the next couple of 
days, particularly in the north, it's going to be on the chilly side in 
terms of the temperatures. We are still looking at single figure 
maximums, there is still cold air sitting over there, the same cold air 
that we have seen over the last couple of weeks, but it has been 
modified as we start to see rain and wind pushing in from the south and 
south west over the next couple of days.'

Mr Powell said the weather will be 'a bit unsettled' but mild through the rest of the week.

Temperatures across much of the north
tomorrow will still be below average, at about 7C to 8C, although it 
will be warmer further south, where temperatures could reach 11C or 12C.

He said: 'So we are beginning to get where we should be.'

But he did warn outbreaks of rain in parts of the south west of England will drift across the rest of the UK.

High pressure meanwhile is expected 
to build on Friday with some sunshine in most places and temperatures 
getting into double figures.

By the weekend temperatures are 
generally expected to be between 11C and 13C, although it will still be 
wet, fairly windy and unsettled in parts.

On Sunday however, the weather is 
expected to be slightly more settled and much of the country is expected
to see temperatures rise to the mid-teens.

The south and east will see the best 
of the weather, with the possibility of temperatures in some spots, such
as East Anglia, hitting 20C, along with drier and brighter conditions.

Mr Powell said: 'Then things will settle back down to average for the start of the working week.'

The weather is expected to remain unsettled over the next three days, with rain spreading across the UK from the south west, but temperatures will hit highs of 20C by Sunday

Today marked the end of the recent cold snap, and temperatures are expected to rise to as high as 20C in parts of the country by Sunday

The Jetstream, which governs most 
weather in the northern hemisphere, has been positioned to the south of 
the UK for the last month, leading to the bitter weather.

But forecasters said that it will 
finally start to move north over the weekend, leading to more 
spring-like conditions.

Despite the weekend forecast, parts of England and Scotland were still covered in snow yesterday as temperatures 
remained unseasonably low – between 4C (39F) and 7C (45F) – following 
one of the coldest Marches on record.
