A couple's long lost wedding photographs have been found 2,470 miles away - on a beach in Israel.

The memory card washed up on Palmachim Beach near Tel Aviv, Israel in 2004 full of images of a blushing bride and her kilted groom outside Edinburgh Castle.

A local woman found the memory card and was unsure of what to do with it and passed it on to her nephew, Tomer Bakshi.

Who are they: A mystery couple pose on their wedding day in Edinburgh 10 years ago

Washed up: The memory card was found here at Palmachim Beach in Israel

Good times: The wedding party are clearly celebrating but their identities remain a mystery

Mr Bakshi said a Scottish relative had identified that some of the photographs were taken in and around Edinburgh, but it was difficult to trace the owners 10 years ago.

However, today Mr Bakshi is keen to restart his search with the help of social media and is calling on Scottish people to help him if they can.

He says he wants to uncover the true identity of the wedding group who feature in panoramic landscape shots of the city taken from Arthur's Seat.

Other clues include shots of the bride and 
groom at the Edinburgh Castle walkway and guests at a wedding reception.

One mystery snap shows Loch Venacher in the Trossachs, another features a man 
in his 60s or 70s standing in front of the Forth Rail Bridge and a woman can be seen posing with a highland cow.

Can you help: Tomer Bakshi is pictured here with girlfriend Sarah-Lee Simpson - he wants to trace the owner of the lost photographs which were taken in Edinburgh 10 years ago

Mr Bakshi, 27, said: 'My aunt found the memory card and because she's not a technical person she gave it to me and asked me to find out who it belonged to. I had no idea.

'I tried posting on an Israeli platform that was the equivalent of Facebook back then, but I couldn't find anything that would help me.'

Shots: Over 100 shots were found on the memory card

Do you know this man: This is just one of the images of a man in his 60s or 70s standing in front of the Forth Rail Bridge

Mystery woman: Will this woman  posing with a Highland cow be identified?

The card contained more than 100 pictures including shots of skiers at Hillend ski slope, panoramic views of Edinburgh from Hollyrood Park, and other sights including Loch Lomond.

After showing the photos to his girlfriend, Sarah-Lee Simpson, and her father, Ellis, who are from Glasgow, he decided to keep on searching.

Gravestone: Is this image significant to the couple's identity? If it is it may reveal everything

Skier: Is this you on the slopes at Hillend ski slope?

Home: Does anyone know where this pretty spot is with its row of white houses?

Mr Bakshi 
said: 'I told Ellis about it and I thought I'd deleted the pictures a 
couple of years ago, but I managed to find them on the computer.

'It
 just didn't cross my mind because I am not familiar with Scotland, so I
 had no idea who to speak to. I hope we can still find them.'

Roni 
Hyslop, director of Edinburgh-based wedding planners All Wrapped Up, 
said the pictures are just as important as a professional's and that the
 couple would be happy to get them back.

He said: 'It's the little incidental moments that you get. The little moments that are not staged.

'These are special photographs taken from angles that the professionals don't capture.'
