A heroic World War Two pilot who survived almost 70 missions against the Germans and was still in the cockpit at the age of 90, is in hospital fighting for his life after being knocked down by a hit and run driver. 

Doug Gregory, 92, is believed to have been making his normal trip to the shops when he was knocked down by a silver Nissan outside a petrol station in Blackfield in Hampshire. 

The former RAF pilot, who still holds all his licences to fly, was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross after he survived 67 missions into Nazi-controlled Europe during the Second World War. He also survived a brain haemorrhage in 1947 and only retired from his job as a stunt pilot at the age of 90. 

War veteran Doug Gregory survived almost 70 missions across Germany and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. He is now in hospital in a serious condition after being a victim of a hit and run in Hampshire 

Mr Gregory was taken to Southampton General Hospital after suffering a head injury and is believed to be in a serious condition. 

Police said they were treating the incident as a hit and run because the car failed to stop after the accident. 

However they said a female motorist had come forward to officers shortly afterwards. 

Mr Gregory had just bought a paper at a newsagents and was starting to walk home when he was hit by a silver-coloured Nissan on Monday morning.

Mr Gregory was struck by a car which failed to stop outside the petrol station in Blackfield in Hampshire 

Part of the road was closed while police investigated the collision and officers spent almost five hours at the scene.

They also visited a nearby Tesco Express store and asked to view CCTV footage in case the accident had been caught on camera.

A broken wing mirror found in the road was taken away for examination.

At the age of 90 the pensioner said he would give up work as a stunt pilot but would still continue flying

Sergeant Darren Ord, senior investigating officer from Hampshire Police, said: 'An elderly gentleman was crossing from the newsagents to the petrol station when he was in collision with a car coming from his right.

'He suffered a serious head injury and was taken to Southampton General Hospital. His wife and son are with him.'

A woman working at the newsagents said: 'I saw a man lying on the ground, surrounded by people on their mobiles.'

The stunt pilot is pictured in his RAF uniform beside the plane he built himself at a cost of around £5,000

Mr Gregory said two years ago he had no plans to stop flying but is now in a serious condition in hospital

As well as his achievements during World War Two, Mr Gregory's love of flying continued after the war. 

He defied the odds to recover from a brain haemorrhage and get back to the skies again - constructing his own aircraft, which he flew for nine years in the Great War Display team. 

He became Britain's oldest stunt pilot  until he decided to give up his role at the age of 90 in 2013.

At the time the pensioner said: 'Flying has been my favourite thing all my life, especially aerobatics. I don't do any other kind of sport. Flying is quite enough to keep me going.'

He joined the Royal Air Force as early as he could, at the age of 18, and has been flying for seven decades. Mr Gregory also holds all the relevant licences, meaning he can still fly and said he plans to never stop.
