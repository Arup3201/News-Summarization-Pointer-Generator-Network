A Los Angeles man and the woman he proposed to in December are among the 10 people who died Thursday night in a fiery crash involving a bus taking high school students to a California university.

Meanwhile, it emerged late Friday night that a 17-year-old twin who was on the bus carrying 44 students who was missing was identified among the dead, NBC Los Angeles reported. The girl's sister was also traveling to Humboldt State University, but was on a different bus.

Another student, Adrian Castro, 18, has also been identified among those that perished. he was a senior at El Monte High School who played on the school's fottball team

Michael Myvett, 29, and his fiancee Mattison Haywood were serving as chaperones on the bus that was traveling from Southern California to Humboldt State University when it was hit by a FedEx tractor-trailer and exploded into flames.

'He just died,' his grandmother Debra Loyd said. 'He was my grandson, the greatest grandson any grandparent could ever have."

Marisa Serrato, 17, has been missing since Thursday evening after a FedEx tractor-trailer slammed into the bus, said her brother Miguel Serrato, 23.

The other twin, Marisol Serrato, was on a different bus that wasn't involved in the crash and made it safely to the school Friday.

Myvett had given Haywood her engagement ring outside the Louvre art museum in Paris on Christmas Day, said his employers at the Center for Autism and Other Disorders in Torrance. He had provided therapy for autistic children for the last two years.

He was 'able to connect with our kids on a level few others could, and he contributed to their wellbeing in such a positive and profound way,' the center's operations manager Kyle Farris said in a statement.

'Adrian Castro will be missed as a student and football player,' El Monte football coach Joel Sanchez told the Press-Telegram. 'He was a good young man with a bright future. He will always be remembered by the El Monte family.'

Although Castro was not a star football player, Raul Castro said his son always pushed himself.

'He was stubborn,' Mr. Castro said. 'When he wanted to do something, he applied himself until he finished it.'

In Humboldt, Marisol had been trying to find her sister, calling around to hospitals for information, Serrato said.

'She
 says she believes that it's her fault because it was her idea to go 
check out that university,' Serrato said. 'She's devastated right now. I
 told her to keep her head up and have faith in God.'
