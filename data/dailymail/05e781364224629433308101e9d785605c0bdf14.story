Knockout: John Applewhite, 34, was punched in Long Island by a man in a random attack, breaking his jaw

A Long Island resident has been arrested for attacking a volunteer utility worker from Florida who had travelled to New York to help restore power after Hurricane Sandy left the region largely without power.

Thomas Libretto, 34, was arrested outside of his Long Island home four days after allegedly beating up John Applewhite, also 34, but he insisted that he is actually the victim.

Libretto and his girlfriend went to dinner at Texas Roadhouse in East Meadow, Long Island on Friday because they were happy to have their power restored.

The New York Post reports that because the restaurant was too full to accommodate them, they got back to their car in the parking lot and were driving out when   they saw Applewhite allegedly urinating in public.

'I mean he had is penis out- right in front of me and my girlfriend. In a joking way I said "Oh pal do you have to do that there?" Libretto told the paper.

Applewhite had travelled to East Hempstead, Long Island from his home in Lakeland, Florida with 24 other electrical workers, and had just finished a 16-hour shift when he said that the man started yelling at him.

Applewhite said that the suspect got out of his black BMW, walked toward him, and punched him once in the face, breaking his jaw and fracturing several other bones in his face.

Libretto contradicts that version, saying that the utility worker kicked his car and so he got out to check the damage.

His girlfriend Victoria Fasullo 
defends his story, saying that Libretto had no choice but to get out of 
the car and check what happened so that he could properly make an 
insurance claim afterwards.

'This "victim" walked up to our car, 
knowing the odds were stacked in his favor, knowing his buddies would 
come out of nowhere to back him up,' Ms Fasullo told The Post.

Her vision came true when- Libretto says- eight to 10 of Applewhite's friends joined the altercation and pounced on Libretto.

'They kicked the s**t out of me. I’m not some animal. I would never punch anyone for no reason,' Libretto said.

According to the Nassau County Police 
Department, the man parked his car and walked toward Mr Applewhite and 
fellow lineman John Barefoot.

Thinking the man had a question about 
power restoration, Mr Applewhite headed in the direction of the man, 
while Mr Barefoot stayed by the service vehicle.

‘Just as I got within arm’s reach, he decked me,’ Mr Applewhite told WTSP. The single punch broke his jaw, his cheekbone, and other facial bones. He also suffered a black eye.

When Mr Barefoot tried to intervene, the suspect allegedly bit him on the finger and then ran back to his BMW, driving away.

Mr Applewhite was rushed to Nassau Medical Center, but he was eventually flown back to Tampa.

The lineman said that his jaw has to be wired shut, and he faces reconstructive surgery to repair the broken bones in his face.

Despite the brutality of the attack, Mr Applewhite said that he still holds a good impression of the town, according to ABC Action News.

‘It
was one heck of a punch,’ he told the station. ‘If nothing else, I 
would like to shake the guy’s hand. He got a heck of a jab.’

Mr
Applewhite’s sister, Mary Anne, told WTSP that she is saddened by the 
attack. ‘John is such a sweet person and he certainly didn’t deserve 
this,’ she said, noting the difficulty her brother will face during the 
upcoming holidays.

But his 
father, Morris Applewhite, had a more practical solution. ‘If he has his
jaw wired shut, we will just feed him through a straw, and he’ll enjoy 
it,’ he said.

ABC 7
reports today that Libretto was arrested outside his Levittown, Long 
Island home and has been charged with third-degree assault. He is 
scheduled to appear at his arraignment on November 27.

Parts
of Long Island were hard-hit by last month’s Superstorm Sandy, flooding
homes, and leaving thousands without heat and power.

Disaster
relief organizations like FEMA and the National Guard have been sent 
in, but many in the hardest-hit areas remain without power.

Volunteer workers like Mr Applewhite have been working with LIPA to help customers still stuck in the dark.
