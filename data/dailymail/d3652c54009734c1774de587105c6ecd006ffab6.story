A friend of the victim claimed the attack was racially motivated, posting on a Kent University Facebook page: 'To the disgusting person in McDonalds tonight who set my friends hair on fire simply because she is not white.

'You are disgusting and a disgrace to the human race, she did absolutely nothing to you as she was simply waiting around for myself and others who were waiting for food.

'The fact you targeted her is disgusting, and that you left like a wimp without owning up to your criminal act makes you even more despicable.

'We have reported you to the police and we appeal to any one who was there this evening to come forth with their reports/evidence.

'I cannot believe that in this day and age there are still people who are as racially discriminative and backwards thinking as you.' 

A McDonald's spokesperson said: 'We are aware of the incident and are cooperating with the Police in their inquiries'.

Thomas Howell added: 'I saw this happen but didn't see the guy, I hope this absolute **** gets caught and charged.'

Andrew Harris wrote: 'Being there at the time it happened it was horrific. I do hope the person who did it is put forward, as well as his scum bag friend who recorded it on their phone...'
