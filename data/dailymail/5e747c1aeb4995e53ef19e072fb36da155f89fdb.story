He is known for his occasional forays into avant-garde fashion, but even for David Beckham sporting a roll of clingfilm seems an unusual choice.

The 37-year-old sportsman was pictured after being substituted off an LA Galaxy game with a clingfilm-like substance around his abdomen.

It is thought the shiny material could be used to keep an ice pack in place after a minor injury.

Sam Wilde, director of physiotherapy at 
Pure Sports Medicine, said: ‘It is often used on rugby and football 
players when they come off the pitch after they’ve had a knock.

‘It is very much like clingfilm and is used to keep an icepack in place – it's reasonably comfortable to wear.’

‘It can also be used to keep heat rubs and cold gels in place – it works well because it keeps the temperature consistent,’ said Larry Koyama, physiotherapist at Exercise and Rehab.

Beckham was wrapped up after he was substituted out of the game in which Los Angeles Galaxy claimed a 3-1 victory over San Jose.

He was also substituted out with ten 
minutes left in a game on Sunday, which ended in a shock 1-0 home defeat by
the San Jose Earthquakes.

It has been rumoured the 37-year-old star is not expected to renew his one-year rolling contract with the club, which comes to an end on December 31.

He is reportedly set to quit the team and may move to New York so his wife can pursue her fashion career.

Sources close to the former England 
and Manchester United player, who moved to the US from Spain’s Real 
Madrid as part of a £20 million deal in 2007, said he has no plans to 
retire from football.

But
it is understood he and his wife Victoria, 38, are considering a move 
to New York with sons Brooklyn, 13, Romeo, ten, Cruz, seven and 
16-month-old daughter Harper.

This week Beckham was asked if he had another season in him, two years shy of turning 40.

‘Who
knows?’ he said. ‘I’m going to enjoy being in the play-offs... and then
we’ll see how this body feels. Even when I stop playing, I’ll have a 
hunger to do something better and be the best.’

The Beckhams' spokesman said: ‘Since David and Victoria landed in America there has been speculation they will leave, yet they still love living there. David’s sole focus at the moment is winning another Championship.’

Victoria’s spokesman said: ‘Right now it’s business as usual and the family are happy here in LA.’
