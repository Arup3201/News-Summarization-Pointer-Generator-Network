Jailed: Craig Williams was sentenced to 22 months in prison for dangerous driving

A motorist who drove up the highest mountain in England and Wales in a 4x4 twice has been jailed.

Craig Williams, 40, was convicted of two offences of dangerous driving, two weeks apart, on 3,560ft Snowdon in September 2011 by a jury.

It was revealed that Williams had failed to answer bail for the start of the trial and that a man  resembling him had been seen on CCTV in the early hours of Thursday placing a message on the window of Caernarfon Crown Court saying: 'Can't catch me, try to catch me if you can.'

Prosecutor Matthew Curtis said on Wednesday morning the defendant sent an email to his solicitors with a letter to the judge.

Mr Curtis told Judge Merfyn Hughes QC: ‘The letter addressed to you indicated that the defendant was going to be at the summit of Mount Snowdon as the verdicts were going to be returned.’ There was a suicide note in the form of a long poem.

Mr Curtis said police were sceptical of the suggestion of a suicide attempt but could not ignore it and started a search. A member of the Llanberis mountain rescue team went to the snowy summit of Snowdon.

The North Wales police helicopter also flew from its Rhuddlan base to Snowdon and searched the railway line, footpaths and ridges. The cost for 50 minutes was £1,767.

On Thursday morning Williams was found sleeping in a vehicle in Snowdonia.

The court heard that the bill for repairs to the Snowdon mountain railway and recovery of the vehicle following his two ascents in a 4x4 amounted to thousands of pounds.

Williams was jailed for six months for 
the first count of dangerous driving on September 3, 2011 and ten months
for the second offence later that month. He admitted failing to answer 
to bail and was jailed for six months.

The judge told Williams: 'The danger you created on both occasions was both obvious and serious.'

But the sentences were ordered to be served consecutively making a total jail term of 22 months. He was also banned from driving for three years and until he takes an extended driving test.

Judge Hughes told him : ‘The danger you created on both occasions was both obvious and serious. That no-one was injured is no thanks to you. This was a deliberate act on both occasions and can be correctly described by the prosecution as a stunt

‘It was committed by you for your own selfish reasons and in complete disregard for the safety of others exercising their lawful right to enjoy Snowdon. You have showed no remorse whatsoever. Your involvement has cost many thousands of pounds to the public who have had to clear up the mess you have left behind.’

The judge said Williams had sent a hoax letter and poem to the court making it clear he had no intention of coming to his trial. The letter also indicated he intended to commit suicide on the summit of Snowdon and he provided coordinates.

Mr Williams failed to answer bail for the start of the trial. A man resembling him had been seen on CCTV posting a message on the window of the court (pictured) saying 'Can't catch me, try to catch me if you can.'

 ’A search was commenced for what was thought might be a casualty. A member of the mountain rescue team was sent to the summit in treacherous conditions and a police helicopter also carried out a search again at public expense but nothing was found.’

He then had the ‘cheek’ to come to Caernarfon Crown Court in the early hours of January 17 and place on the window of the court a poem and a declaration taunting the police.

The jury had heard how on the first ascent the modified Vauxhall Frontera reached 200 metres from the summit. The second time Williams got to the top. He claimed, however, that a prankster had taken his vehicle on this occasion.
