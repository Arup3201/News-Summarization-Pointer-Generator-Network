Scott Calder led a drugs gang who tracked rivals' cars using surveillance technology before raiding cannabis farms and making off with the drugs. He was jailed for three and a half years this week

A bodybuilder nicknamed 'The Demon' has been jailed for leading a drugs gang which used tracker bugs to follow cannabis growers and raid their factories.

Scott Calder, 23, and his accomplices planted surveillance devices on the cars of their rivals so they could follow then to their hideouts and steal cannabis.

Police swooped on the gang after Calder and his mother were shot and wounded in a gangland hit as he was picking her up from bingo.

Fearing gang warfare was about to erupt, officers stopped a car driven by one of Calder's accomplices and found evidence that nine trackers had been used during the course of an underworld 'taxing' operation against local dealers. 

During the various searches of the suspects' homes, officers seized tracking devices and software, a meat cleaver, a sword, machetes, drugs paraphernalia and mobile phones.

Calder, from Moston, Manchester, admitted conspiracy to burgle and was jailed for three and a half years at the city's crown court this week.

The thug was said to be notorious in his neighbourhood after calling himself 'The Demon' on Facebook and posting warning messages.

One read: 'Stab me in the back, I'll blast ur spine.' Others said: 'In this game there's only one don' and 'Even if I died young who cares.'

Last January, Calder and his 56-year old mum, Marie, were caught in a hail of bullets after being ambushed by two gunmen as she got into his car outside the Gala Bingo Hall at a shopping centre in Harpurhey, Manchester.

They managed to get themselves to hospital with gunshot wounds to the arms but miraculously neither were seriously injured.

Calder was known as 'The Demon' by locals  and boasted online that he did not care if he died young

He also posted pictures of himself enjoying expensive bottles of champagne and getting into a sports car

Police investigating the shooting mounted a major operation after discovering Calder and his gang were involved in a criminal plot to track known drug dealers to cannabis farms and then steal the plants and growing equipment.

It emerged the gang would carry out surveillance outside a shop which sold equipment used for growing cannabis and planted GPS trackers on visitor's cars, so they could follow them without being spotted. 

The gang also acted on tip-offs from other criminals who knew the whereabouts of cannabis farms being grown by Vietnamese gangsters. One victim who found a tracker hidden on his vehicle was ordered to return it or 'his head would be blown off.'

In one raid, the gang were chased off by a cannabis farmer who set his guard dog on them. Two days later they raided another grower and escaped with a duvet cover full of cannabis plants.

In April, Calder, who had by then recovered from his gunshot wounds, was arrested after police bugged his car before stopping him and finding a combat hunting knife.

The following month, officers seized a silver Skoda used by the gang. When it was searched, police recovered a laptop which was forensically examined and led police to the tracking company. The gang were then rounded up one-by-one.

Dale Hall, 29, Jack Biernat, 27, both of Chadderton, near Oldham and Paul Andrews, 25, and Ryan Hayes, 26, both of Moston, all pleaded guilty to conspiracy to burgle.

Hall was given four years, Biernat three years, Andrews three years and nine months and Hayes two years and eight months.

Sentencing the five men, Judge Patrick Field QC said it was a 'sophisticated and well-planned scheme'.

Speaking after the case, Det Con Wes Knights of Greater Manchester Police said: 'These men were involved in a criminal plot to "tax" cannabis farms - in other words, steal the plants from known dealers and farmers and reap the rewards for themselves.

Calder - known locally as 'The Demon' - posted scores of pictures of himself online in a trademark pose

He showed off by posting pictures of himself riding a quad bike around Moston on his Facebook page

As well as boasting there was 'only one Don', he posted a photo of this expensive watch and jewellery

Detective Knights added: 'The indiscriminate nature of their tactics left innocent members of the public at risk, which is something we as a police service cannot tolerate.

'The theft of cannabis plants, known among the criminal fraternity as "taxing", is a very dangerous one.

'Not only does it continue to propagate the market for illegal drugs to be sold and people to suffer serious harm as a result of consuming those drugs, but it creates rivalries and bad blood between gangs that leads to other criminality. All too often, innocent people are caught up in this.

'That is why taking this gang off the streets is a fantastic result not just for us but for people who are fed-up with cannabis dealers operating in their area.

'We have effectively cut out a major supply route for cannabis getting onto our streets and also taken a dangerous group of criminals with access to weapons and tracking devices out of the game.'

Police said Calder's gang's plan of 'taxing' local dealers would have created bad blood between crime groups
