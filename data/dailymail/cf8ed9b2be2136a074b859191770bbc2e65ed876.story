A record-breaking 'dream bull' bull who sired an estimated 500,000 offspring in more than 50 countries been laid to rest.

When Toystory passed away on Thanksgiving Day, his owners believed the 2,700-pound bull had provided more than 2.4 million units of semen - making him a world beater.

A single unit, about 1/20th of a teaspoon, sells for anywhere between a few dollars to several hundred, meaning Toystory most made tens of millions of dollars for his owners, Genex Cooperative Inc.

A Dutch bull named Sunny Boy had previously been thought of as the worlds best sire. The bull, memorialized with a life-size statue at the headquarters of his owner in the Netherlands, sold 1.7 million units in the 1990s.

Toystory surpassed the 2 million mark in 2012, according to markings on his 'spermometer', Wsj.com reports. The milestone was celebrated at his home barn with a cake and lashings of hay.

Normally bulls siring careers are short lived and they're put out to pasture, as a bull with better generics comes along. Such is the prestige to have a bull that can sell a million units, breeders have coined a name for it - the millionaires club.  

Jan Hessel Bierma, the editor in chief of dairy breeding magazine Holstein international, said Toystory was a 'dream bull'.

Such was Toystory's fame in the artificial segmentation game, the bull's prowess was celebrated with a line of hats, t-shirts and even his own commemorative semen straws. On his Facebook page, the late sire was remembered as a 'legend' and 'Torazo', the Spanish word for super bull.    

Toystory was a beast of an animal with a neck measuring 57 inches, and a ferocious sexual appetite to match. He typically produced sperm nine times a week - about twice the average of other bulls owned by Genex. 

One veterinarian reportedly dubbed Toystory 'meaner than a snake', and Glen Gilbert, vice president of production said the bull's interest in sex was the only thing keeping them safe.

He told the newspaper: 'The old adage was as long as he was interested in sex, he wasn’t interested in you. But if he lost that other interest, you had to be careful.'

Toystory was named after the children's movie, but he was no gentle giant with one veterinarian saying he was 'meaner than a snake' 

Toystory, named after the children's movie, was born in 2001. His father, Bellwood Marshall was a popular sire and his mother, Toyane, was a top milk producer. 

Mitch Breunig, who raised the bull at Mystic Valley Dairy in central Wisconsin, said Toystory stood out because he gained weight so fast. He sold the bull at six months old for about $4,000. 

At around a year old, Genex used Tostory's semen to breed dozens of cows. His breeders than had to wait a few years to see how his offspring turned out before they could start selling his sperm.

By the mid-2000s, Toystory's semen sales took off and he scored highly in the dairy industry's influential performance rankings. At that time a unit of his sperm was selling for $60 and by 2009, Genex had sold a million.

Toystory's semen became renowned for getting cows pregnant and his daughters were known to be easy to birth and dependably strong. 

Mr. Bierma compared Toystory with a Volkswagen Golf, saying the bull wasn't 'fancy' but would do 'the job every day and for a long time' and wasn't too expensive.

Toystory's daughters had 'exceptional feet and legs and exceptional udders', said Eddie Bue, manager of Ludwig Farms in central Illinois. He paid $300,000 for one of Toystory's daughters in 2009.

Over the summer, Toystory began having back problems and was put into retirement. 

He is now buried atop what is known as Stony Hill, which his handlers chose to reflect Toystory's stature. 

Genex has said that a memorial service will be held for the bull in spring, when they plan to name a breeding campus after him. 

Keith Heikes, chief operating officer at Genex, said it was 'very possible' no other bull with ever surpass Toystory's record.
