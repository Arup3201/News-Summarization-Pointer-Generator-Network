An airport employee was allegedly assaulted by a man with his backpack Tuesday morning.

The incident took place at 6:22am at a security checkpoint inside Boston's Logan International Airport, Massachusetts State Police said.

The 74-year-old victim - who has not been publicly identified by authorities - talked to 53-year-old Eric S. Brandhorst as he kneeled on the ground, state police said in a release. 

Brandhorst's backpack 'was too large to fit inside a guide rack for appropriately-sized carry-on luggage,' it stated. 

Confrontation: Eric Brandhorst allegedly assaulted an airport worker after she told him his backpack was too big and pointed out a place where he could check it instead

The woman indicated a place where Brandhorst could check his backpack instead after he got on his feet, Massachusetts State Police said.

'Suddenly, and with no further conversation, the approximately 6-foot, 200-pound [Brandhorst] swung the backpack with both hands from his right shoulder into the left side of the victim’s face, knocking her down,' the release said.

Nearby Trooper Dana Cresta saw the assault took place and got Brandhorst down on the ground, according to Massachusetts State Police. 

Brandhorst faces assault and battery with a dangerous weapon on a person age 60 or older charges, the release said. 

He reportedly said he had been 'aggravated' and 'made a mistake' while speaking to state police at his booking.

Both the woman's left eye and left side or her face were bruised, and she told authorities she had hip, knee and shoulder pain, Massachusetts State Police said. Massport firefighters looked at the woman before she was taken to a hospital.
