Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet is a doubt for Belgium's internationals with Cyprus and Israel after injuring his ankle in a collision with Wayne Rooney during Sunday's defeat to Manchester United.

Rooney appeared to be clipped by Martin Skrtel before falling into Mignolet and landing on the goalkeeper's ankle. The 27-year-old will have a scan.

Mignolet is Belgium's second choice stopper behind Thibaut Courtois of Chelsea but the news represents another injury blow for Belgium boss Marc Wilmots.
