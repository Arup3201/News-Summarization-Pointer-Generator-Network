Mark Thomas allegedly stated that working mothers 'should not hold senior management positions'. John Smith, pictured, authorised a bonus of £120,000 for Mr Thomas despite the allegations, a tribunal heard

A ‘fat cat’ BBC chief declared working mothers cannot ‘focus’ on their jobs and have no place in top roles, the whistleblowing tribunal heard.

Mark Thomas, a £200,000-a-year corporation executive, allegedly stated ‘women with child caring responsibilities should not hold senior management positions’.

This was because they ‘are less focused on the job and not suited’, the Watford Employment Tribunal was told.

The BBC is accused of covering up sexist behaviour.

Another boss allegedly admitted that, 
even if evidence of sexism was found, the corporation ‘would find it 
difficult to admit any wrongdoing’, regardless of the ‘truth’, adding: 
‘The organisation would have to come first.’

Mr
 Thomas’s alleged remarks came after one of his staff, Katy Child, a 
mother of two young children, asked for a flexible working arrangement, 
the tribunal heard.

Mr
 Thomas, who has since left the corporation, was the chief executive of 
BBC Studios and Post Production and was ‘very unhappy’ about the 
request. He is said to have told Byron Myers, the head of human 
resources: ‘That b**** has had every guy in here wrapped around her 
fingers.’

In a witness statement, Mr Myers told the tribunal: ‘Mr Thomas said it was a bombshell. He said we needed a plan to sort this out.’ Miss Child, the £42,000-a-year head of commercial development, had her first baby in 2007, and returned from her second maternity leave in September 2009.

Mr Myers said Mr Thomas hit on the idea of offering her a job share with ‘conditions of acceptance so onerous Katy would have no choice but to refuse the offer’.

Byron Myers told the tribunal that Mr Thomas planned to keep a mother who asked for flexible working hours on 'at risk status' for redundancy

The conditions would require her to work 12 weeks a year full time, and be ‘unworkable’ for a mother.

Later, he claimed, Mr Thomas came up with a different approach. ‘He explained to me that Katy would be kept on an “at risk status” for redundancy’, meaning that after six months ‘her employment would be terminated irrespective of her performance’.

Mr Myers decided he could not go along with this, and formally blew the whistle to his superiors.

But he alleges he was informed that John Smith – the BBC’s highest paid executive – ‘would not like the idea of a formal investigation’.

Mr Smith even authorised a bonus of £120,000 for Mr Thomas, despite the sexism claims, the tribunal heard.

Mr Smith, who is due to give evidence later, is understood to reject Mr Myers’ accusations, and will say he demanded a full investigation into the matter.

The storm blew up in the wake of Countryfile presenter Miriam O’Reilly winning her tribunal against the BBC for discriminating against her as an older woman, in January 2011. Miss Child filed a formal complaint of harassment and sexism against Mr Thomas in August 2011.

Mr Myers said that, as the BBC prepared its response to her complaint, he was pressured to sign a statement saying there had been no discrimination, when he did not agree.

Miss Child has since come to an arrangement to work part-time at the corporation. She is not giving evidence at the tribunal, which is between Mr Myers and the BBC. He accuses the corporation of forcing him out after he turned whistleblower.

Caspar Glyn QC, for the BBC, said it was untrue Mr Thomas had referred to Miss Child as a ‘b****’ who had the men in the office wrapped around her finger. He also dismissed the claim about Mr Thomas saying working mothers should not hold senior management positions.

The tribunal continues.
