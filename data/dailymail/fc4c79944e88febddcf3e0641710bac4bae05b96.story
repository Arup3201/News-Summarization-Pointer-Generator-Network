A bullying undertaker sacked an older female employee and told staff he would replace her with a 'fit young blonde', a tribunal heard.

Jon Christophers, who runs family firm F Christophers and Son Ltd in Devon, said he would get rid of 64-year-old grandmother Rozamund Perrin 'because he wanted someone younger'.

The tribunal in Exeter heard that the 6ft 4in boss was an 'intimidating bully' who also 'missed deadlines' - a serious error for a funeral director.

Miss Perrin, known as Roz, took her claim for unfair dismissal, sex and age discrimination to tribunal after she was sacked from her job of four years. 

Her colleague Kate Parsons, a funeral director who worked at the firm, gave evidence and said: 'Jon's attitude in the office was that he was above all of us – no please or thank you.

'It was his way or no way. He would belittle Roz in front of clients, make promises he couldn't keep, miss deadlines and leave Roz to make the apologies and deal with the wrath of clients. He would make errors and try and blame Roz.'

Mrs Parsons said Mr Christophers said to her: 'Don't worry, I'll get rid of her [Miss Perrin] and replace her with a young fit blonde,' and did go on to find a younger replacement.

The undertaker said Miss Perrin, of Stokeinteignhead, Devon, carried out many duties within the family run firm and helped Mrs Parsons dress the deceased.

She said: 'I can recall when we had to dress a very large gentleman and I asked Roz whether she would help out.

'Roz was willing to do so and was excellent. After we had dressed the deceased, Jon came in before we could move the deceased to the coffin.

'I remember clearly Jon saying sarcastically "oh look, the two women have tried but couldn't manage it".'

She said Mr Christophers also mocked Miss Perrin's typing even though she suffered with arthritis. 

Miss Perrin said he was an 'intimidating bully' who fell out with Mrs Parsons.

She said: 'I think Jon was threatened by Kate because she was an experienced funeral director. Jon used to make mistakes with funeral arranging and Kate would sort them out.

'Jon was very rude to Kate and often swore at her.'

Miss Perrin also said there was an issue with Mr Christophers' toilet habit of not cleaning the office loo after he used it.

There was only the one toilet for clients and staff alike and she said Mr Christophers would 'use the toilet but leave it in a very unpleasant state'.

She said: 'When I raised the issue with him, he said "that's your job".

She added: 'He dismissed me because he wanted someone younger. He was looking for a fit young blonde.'

The tribunal panel was told that Mr Christophers was also overheard making a phone call when he said his female staff ‘don’t submit to me – that’s the problem – all women should submit to me.’ 

F Christophers and Son Ltd are a small family run funeral directors with branches at Ashburton and Newton Abbot in Devon and have been going since 1846.

They say 'we are proud to be independent and will continue to do so with the next generation of the family'.

The firm is run by senior director Fred Christophers, 74, and his son Jon is a fellow partner.   

Tribunal judge Colm O'Rourke ruled that she was unfairly dismissed and discriminated against and said it was 'a humiliating and degrading environment based on her gender'.

He said the panel agreed that Mr Christophers had a 'general discriminatory attitude to age' and concluded she suffered discrimination and harassment due to her sex and age.

Miss Perrin is seeking £45,000 damages from the firm and a remedy hearing will decide on the final settlement.
