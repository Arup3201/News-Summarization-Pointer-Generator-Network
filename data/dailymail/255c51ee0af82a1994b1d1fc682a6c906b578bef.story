The high school principal accused of using hypnosis on students who then committed suicide will avoid jail time in return for a plea deal.

As part of a deal with Sarasota County prosecutors, 52-year-old George 
Kenney pleaded no contest to practicing therapeutic hypnosis without a 
license. He was sentenced to one year of probation.

Officials say Kenney hypnotized two North Port High students before the 
two, independently of one another, committed suicide last year.

He also hypnotized 75 other students, teachers and their families in private sessions at the school.

Officials say Kenney had been warned by his boss to stop using such 
one-on-one hypnosis with students.

Kenney's attorney has said that the 
principal's supervisor only expressed concern and never gave him a 
written directive to stop the hypnosis.

Kenney is currently on administrative duty not at the school. The 
Sarasota Herald-Tribune reports that Kenney applied for retirement in 
December.

Kenney came under the spotlight after student Wesley McKinley, 16, was found dead in an abandoned house from a 
suspected drugs overdose in April 2011. The day before he killed himself
he underwent a hypnosis session with Mr Kenney.

An investigation by officials following the April suicide of of Wesley
uncovered other students who had come under the principal's influence.

Kenney admitted to having hypnotized 17-year-old Brittany Palumbo five months 
before she killed herself on May 4 last year.

He also held hypnosis sessions with 
16-year-old Marcus Freeman six days before he died in a car wreck on 
March 15. All three were students at his school.

A report was filed by school chiefs last June 
who found that Kenney had lied to officials about hypnosis sessions and 
defied three separate orders to stop the practice.

He first told police he never hypnotized Miss Palumbo but later admitted he had lied.

A teacher at the school, Linda Thornton, 68, was also killed in a car wreck while driving to work in November 2010. It is not known whether she was hypnotized by Kenney.

Kenney has claimed the students were 
happy to be hypnotized as it helped them concentrate in class. Many had 
been taking part in competitive sports and he said the hypnosis helped 
them focus.

Many pupils at North Port High School have come out to defend Dr Kenney and Facebook groups have been set up called 'Bring Back Dr Kenney' and 'Students in Support of Dr George Kenney'.

One former student Eric Williams, 20, was the first person Dr Kenney ever hypnotized. He told Good Morning America that his SAT scores 'went up 500 points after the hypnosis'.

When asked about her fellow students' deaths, another former pupil Kallie Dremann added: 'They are just trying to pick someone to blame it on.'

He has published a number of audio CDs which are sold on Amazon. One uses hypnosis to help defeat anxiety while others focus on sports - baseball pitching and batting along with improving basketball throws.

Kenney became a certified hypnotist after attending the Omni Hypnosis Training Centre in Deland, Florida.

An investigation had revealed that Wesley McKinley, who had showed no outward sign of depression, got his mother's signed approval to take part in the session with his high school principal.

But his parents later said they had a 'ton of questions' and wondered if the hypnosis had played a part in their son's decision to take his own life.

According to ABC, private investigators hired by the school district interviewed Kenney, who has been at the Florida school for a decade, over the allegations.

The reported stated that the principal said he felt terrible about 'putting his school and his students through something that they didn't need or deserve to have to endure on top of all the tragedy they already have experienced" and started to cry.
