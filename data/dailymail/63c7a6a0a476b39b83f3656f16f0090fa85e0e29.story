As Prime Minister David Cameron knows he cannot please all of the people, all of the time.

But he could have been forgiven for thinking he could depend on his wife's vote when asked to name her favourite David.

Apparently ignoring her husband's claim to the title, Samantha confessed that Little Britain star David Walliams had won her over as the 'the funniest man she'd ever met'. 

David Cameron revealed he has lost out to comedian David Walliams in the battle to be Samantha Cameron's favourite David

Mr Cameron hosted a reception in Downing Street last night to mark St David's Day, the national day of Wales.

He told 100 guests in Number 10 how he had been left hurt by his wife's apparent lack of loyalty.

Among those attending the event were business leaders, sports stars, politicians and television personalities attended the event.

They included former Paralympic athlete Baroness Tanni Grey Thompson, Songs Of Praise presenter Aled Jones, stage star Connie Fisher and Gabby Logan, whose father Terry Yorath managed and played for Wales's national football team. 

Mr Cameron said he was 'delighted' that staff from Welsh newspaper the Western Mail were among the guests after asking their readers to name their favourite David in a survey by Principality Building Society.

'I don't know how I'm getting on,' he said. 'All I know is that Samantha admitted to me the other day that her favourite David is David Walliams, which I thought was slightly disappointing as she's married to me.

'She sat next to him at a charity function and said he was the funniest man she'd ever met so I'm going to have to learn to live with that.'

Mr Walliams has been a frequent visitor to Downing Street. In March 2012 the comic, writer and Britain's Got Talent judge posed on the steps of Number 10 with his supermodel wife Lara Stone.

And in 2013 he led a UNICEF campaign with 100 schoolchildren, when he could not resist the temptation to touch the Prime Minister's hair.

Mr Walliams said later: 'Because I'm taller than him, I offered to stand on a lower step so we wouldn't look odd together - he's a tall man but I'm ridiculously tall.

'He's the Prime Minister so he should be the one who is most powerful-looking. He told me not to flick my hair like my character Sebastian in, who flirted with the PM relentlessly.

'And, of course, I immediately did it. It's almost like I've got Tourette's. When I'm told not to do something, I have to do it.'

At last night's reception Mr Cameron said he had been researching his family history and his maternal grandmother's name was Llewellyn and her grandfather was a tin plate maker from Glamorgan called Llewellyn Llewellyn.

'I think that's real Welsh heritage,' he said.
