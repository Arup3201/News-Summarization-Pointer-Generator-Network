Globe trotters: Tom, Verity and baby Matilda. Their feet feature in their all of their holiday snaps

It started as a crazy idea when they lay on the beach at Brighton, with their feet pointing out to sea.

Tom Robinson and girlfriend Verity Carberry thought it would be a wheeze to make a photographic record of their upcoming world travels — with the focus on their two pairs of feet.

Six years later — and after the birth of their daughter — the result is a unique collection.

While most people’s holiday snaps feature smiling faces, the 90 photos, which Tony has called Feet First, involve toes, socks and sandals.

Tom and Verity, both 30, travelled to 31 countries — with trips to South-East Asia, Australia, South and Central America.

They also managed to fit in the 2012 Olympics. Recalling the moment they came up with the idea, Tom said: ‘Verity and I had been going out for about six months, but I had a very strong feeling we’d be together for a long time.

'It would be a way of recording our life adventures together.’ 

During a second visit to Thailand, Tom  proposed to Verity — and she accepted. 

In time, the photo collection took a happy twist, first with a shot showing the couple standing in front of a positive pregnancy test and then a scan of their unborn baby.

Naturally, when baby Matilda was born, a third pair of (very tiny) feet joined the pictures.But this photo love story isn’t finished yet.

As Tom says: ‘I’m sure there will be more feet joining us at some point.’
