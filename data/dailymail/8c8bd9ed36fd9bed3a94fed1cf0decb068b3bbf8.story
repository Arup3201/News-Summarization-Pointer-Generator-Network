Egypt has stepped up its crackdown on the smuggling tunnels linking Egypt to the Gaza Strip which began following the ousting of President Mohamed Morsi in July, Hamas officials claim. 

Security forces are using bulldozers and dynamite to demolish the network of tunnels which are used to transfer cheap fuel and commercial goods into the Palestinian territory.

They are also occasionally used by fighters to move weapons.

Pro-Palestine Campaigners say the crackdown is having dire consequences on people living in Gaza who are now effectively locked in.

Abu Ziyad, a Palestinian tunnel operator told the BBC: 'The number of tunnels was over 1,000. Today only a few hundred remain with the ongoing demolitions.

'Now the number of workers in the tunnel industry has dropped.'

As a result of the clampdown the costs of food and building materials are said to have risen have risen.

The crackdown has also dealt a blow to Hamas, which for years has collected taxes from the movement of goods through the tunnels.

This week Palestinian officials called off a planned round of peace talks after Israeli soldiers killed three protesters during clashes following an arrest raid in the West Bank.

The violence, the deadliest incident in the area in years, dealt a new blow to U.S.-led peace efforts, which resumed late last month after a nearly five-year break.

Palestinian officials have accused the Israelis of stonewalling and using the process as a cover to build new Jewish settlements. The deaths of Palestinians further soured the atmosphere.

It was not known when talks will resume, but Palestinian officials said the break was expected to be brief. They spoke anonymously as they were not authorized to talk to media.

Monday's clashes broke out when Israeli forces entered the Qalandia refugee camp, just outside of Jerusalem, on an overnight arrest raid.

Shai Hakimi, a spokesman for the paramilitary border police, said hundreds of Palestinians poured into the streets and hurled firebombs, concrete blocks and rocks at officers. 

The tunnels are mainly used to transfer cheap fuel and commercial goods but are also occasionally used by fighters to move weapons

The Israeli military said soldiers rushed to the scene to provide backup and opened fire after they felt their lives were in "imminent danger."

The Palestinians want discussions to focus on security issues and the border between Israel and a future state of Palestine.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is expected to meet Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in Rome on Sept. 8 to help push negotiations forward, according to Israeli and Palestinian officials.
