The inventor of the World Wide Web has spoken in support of whistleblower Edward Snowden and said he should be protected.

Sir Tim Berners-Lee said that the former US intelligence contractor and others like him play an essential role in exposing abuses of power, and should not be punished.

The computer scientist also claimed that checks and balances in the US and around the world had failed, and that even with reforms, the system was unlikely to get better.

Sir Tim Berners-Lee has spoken in support of whistleblower Edward Snowden

Sir Tim made his comments to the BBC after Channel Four broadcast Mr Snowden's alternative Christmas message yesterday.

The internet founder said: 'When checks and balances break down, all society can rely on are the whistleblowers.'

He added: 'And because they have been performing this important function of saving society when it is in its most desperate state, therefore we need, I think, to have a form of international recognition for whistleblowers.'

And Sir Tim added that whistleblowers would be particularly important in the future saying that some leaks 'really help and not hurt humanity.'

He said: 'I don't think an automatic Nobel prize is necessarily part of that, but some way of generating an amnesty.'

He added: 'We must assume that those systems in the future will break down too.'

In his Christmas message Mr Snowden, who revealed details of electronic 
surveillance by American and British spy services, warned of the dangers
 posed by a loss of privacy.

Christmas message: Edward Snowden speaks during an interview in Hong Kong

In a 
two-minute video recorded in Moscow, where Snowden has been granted 
temporary asylum, he spoke of concerns over surveillance in an age of 
huge technological advancement.

'We
 have sensors in our pockets that track us everywhere we go. Think about
 what this means for the privacy of the average person,' he said.

'A child born today 
will grow up with no conception of privacy at all,' said Snowden.

'They'll never know what it means to have a private moment to 
themselves, an unrecorded, unanalysed thought. And that's a problem 
because privacy matters, privacy is what allows us to determine who we 
are and who we want to be.'

The
 'Alternative Christmas Message', broadcast annually on 
Channel 4 television since 1993, mimics the format of the yearly address
 to the nation by Queen Elizabeth.

Previous
 participants have included then President of Iran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 
in 2008 and popular cartoon characters Marge and Lisa Simpson in 2004.

On
 Tuesday, Snowden - who disclosed thousands of confidential documents - 
said in an interview published in the Washington Post that he had 
achieved what he set out to do.

'For me, in terms of personal satisfaction, the mission's already accomplished,' he said.

Snowden left his NSA post in Hawaii in May and went public with his first revelations from Hong Kong a few weeks later.

In
 June, he left for Russia and stayed at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport 
for nearly six weeks until the Kremlin granted him temporary one-year 
asylum.

The United States has revoked his passport and demanded he be sent home to face charges for stealing secrets.

President Barak Obama: Last week a White House-appointed panel proposed curbs on NSA surveillance

Earlier
 this month there were signs of thawing attitudes when Richard Ledgett -
 a top NSA official who leads a taskforce at the agency responding to 
the leaks - left open the option for Snowden to return to the United 
States in an amnesty.

'It's worth having a conversation about,' he told CBS.

'I would need assurances that the remainder of the data could be secured and my bar for those assurances would be very high,' Ledgett said. Senior officials in the Obama administration remain opposed to such a move.

Last week a White House-appointed panel proposed curbs on some key NSA surveillance operations, recommending limits on a programme to collect records of billions of telephone calls, and new tests before Washington spies on foreign leaders.

'The conversation occurring today will determine the amount of trust we can place both in the technology that surrounds us and the government that regulates it,' Snowden said in the Christmas address.

'Together we can find a better balance, end mass surveillance and remind the government that if it really wants to know how we feel, asking is always cheaper than spying.'

The former director of the CIA has spoken out over calls to grant clemency to NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.

Robert James Woolsey weighed into the argument saying that the former contractor, who is currently hiding in Moscow, should be 'hanged by the neck until dead.'

It is thought that Mr Woolsey's comments reflect the current thinking in Washington.

However, last week a White House-appointed committee recommended key reforms which would curb NSA surveillance operations.

But disclosing the classified information, Mr Snowden committed crimes, but many feel that he should be allowed to return to the US.
