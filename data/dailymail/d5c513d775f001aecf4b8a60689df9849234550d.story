Keep your hair on, ladies, but the Duchess of Cambridge has a new ’do. Or, to be more accurate, some of the long, luscious locks which we are accustomed to seeing swept back from her pretty face have been snipped into a sweeping fringe.

Kate may have left only a handful of hair on the salon floor, but her new style has caused a sensation, dividing opinion and no doubt sparking a wave of copy-cat cuts.

Now, to most men, her haircut will probably seem insignificant, nothing more than a nod to fashion, or a whim on Kate’s part.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were cheered by members of the public during an appearance on the balcony of the Guildhall in Cambridge

New 'do: Kate saw the funny side though as her blow dry blew across her face on the balcony

But we ladies know that a woman’s 
hair is a barometer for her emotions, and that a cut often signals a 
radical shift in an individual’s life. Many older women decide to chop 
their hair when going through the menopause, for example, while younger 
women change their look when something drastic has happened to them.

And I should know. For when I was 22,
I had my heart broken. Really, truly, badly broken by someone I had 
really, truly loved and trusted, and who behaved abominably.

In those days, I had long, red hair 
that had never been cut. It was so long that I could sit on it — some 
thought it my crowning glory, though my ex had always told me, in his 
affectionate way, that red-heads tended to go bald, and that he detested
the flame-haired beauties celebrated by the artist Titian and the 
Pre-Raphaelites. At the time, I was too crushed to challenge him, but 
when the affair was over I decided I was going to change it.

Cambridge mayor Sheila Stuart also struggled with the strong wind. She said the royal visit was 'absolutely huge' for the city

Despite being complemented on her new hairstyle, Kate appeared to be having second thoughts

What did I do? I went to Vidal Sassoon in London’s South Molton Street and asked them to cut it all off.

I wanted to make the most radical alteration to my appearance I could think of.

‘Do you want me to stop here? Or 
here?’ the hairdresser kept asking, anxiously, as he passed my 
collarbones, my shoulders, my chin.

‘No,’ I snapped. ‘Keep going. I want it all off.’

When it was over, and I was the proud
owner of a shiny new bob, he gave me back the longest swag of my hair, 
reverently woven into a plait and wrapped in tissue paper.

‘You could still wear it as a hair-piece,’ he said, sadly.

Cambridge mayor Sheila Stuart said the royal visit will be remembered for generations

Like Kate, I also asked for a fringe, because a fringe feels like a screen you can hide behind. 

While I loved my new look, the cut 
was a very public statement that something in my life had changed — and 
not everyone liked the new message I was sending out. People who had 
previously criticised me for being a shrinking violet decided I was now 
‘intimidating’ and ‘terrifying’.

While everyone has been talking about Kate’s new hairstyle, some onlookers noted that her husband William’s hair seems to be disappearing at a remarkable rate.

Once the proud possessor of a golden mop-top and a fringe eerily reminiscent of his late mother, now, at the age of 30, he increasingly resembles his balding relatives — particularly his Uncle Edward.

Perhaps he will soon join his father, Prince Charles, in opting for a ‘comb-over’ to cover his bald spot.

Friends were shocked, and my mother, 
never one to mince her words, told me sadly that I ‘had cut off my one 
real beauty’. I didn’t care. I felt like a newborn bird, lighter and 
ready to fly away into a different life.

I wonder what new stage in her life Kate was contemplating, when she sat in the hairdresser’s chair?
After all, she turned 30 in January, and this year has made several 
steps away from the natural, girlish look which so captivated Prince 
William when they were both students at St Andrews.

Her style, while always on the safe 
side, has become more assured. She has rung the changes with elegant 
chignons and a polished half-up half-down hairstyle during her recent 
tour of South-East Asia — so perhaps the revamped locks are just the 
burnishing of her new royal style.

Or could there be something else going on?

Predictably — given that she and 
William have now been married for a year-and-a-half, and he has spoken 
in the past about his desire for children — Kate’s new cut has sparked 
speculation that she may be pregnant. (And if she is keeping a Very 
Important Secret, then that demure long fringe is perfect for hiding 
behind).

William fuelled this speculation 
yesterday on the couple’s first visit to their namesake city, Cambridge,
when he delightedly accepted a Babygro from a well-wisher.

The tiny suit was emblazoned with a 
helicopter and the words ‘Daddy’s little co-pilot’ in honour of the 
Prince’s job as an RAF pilot.

New mother Samantha Hill, 27, from 
Sudbury, Suffolk, who made the present, had brought her baby daughter, 
Beth, to see the royals.

She said: ‘I made it for when his little one comes along. He’s a helicopter pilot, so his baby will think his daddy is cool.

‘When I gave it to him he said: “I’ll keep that.” ’

Jimmy's was opened in 1995 in the basement of a Baptist church and is named after Jim Dilley, who spent the last few years of his life sleeping under a motorway bridge on the M11

While such behaviour confirms William is broody, it does not, of course, prove Kate is pregnant.

But, even if she isn’t expecting, 
I’ll wager that she feels she is entering a new stage in her life, as a 
royal and a wife, rather than a Sloaney twentysomething-about-town. And 
those tumbling tresses are a key part of her identity — just as my own 
red locks are a part of mine.

By coincidence, my decision to go 
short was made easier because of the fashion for bobbed hair set by 
Princess Diana, Kate’s mother-in-law.

In the Eighties, bobs became more fashionable than at any time since the Twenties.

American writer F. Scott Fitzgerald’s
sparkling short story Bernice Bobs Her Hair describes how post-war 
young women kicked against their repressive Edwardian upbringing by 
cutting their hair. In fact, Bernice only pretends she’s going to bob 
her hair because she is angry at being dismissed as unattractive by 
boys.

When she is tricked into going 
through with the cut, she is appalled to realise that her new look makes
her hair lie ‘in lank lifeless blocks on both sides of her suddenly 
pale face. It was ugly as sin.’

Of course, this is always the big 
risk with any new hairstyle. Not everyone admires Kate’s new ’do —  even
the Duchess doesn’t seem entirely convinced by it.

Yesterday she told a fan who complimented her on the style: ‘I’m not sure about it. It’s a bit windy today.’

Homeless catering manager Carmelo Giammona had his picture taken on a smartphone with the Duke and Duchess after he made Kate blush by kissing her hand and calling her beautiful

However, while she may not be sure of
her new cut, her glowing skin and coy smile certainly imply she is 
pleased with something.

For my part, I still had short hair 
when I met the man who became my husband and fell happily in love. He 
said that as my hair was such a pretty colour, it was a shame not to 
have as much of it as possible. Having found my trips to the hairdresser
quite expensive, I was relieved to be able to stop going.

Ever since, it has remained on the 
long side — but when I suggested that, now we have two teenage children,
I should go for the chop, he reacted with horror.

‘No, please, never cut it again,’ he said. And I haven’t.
