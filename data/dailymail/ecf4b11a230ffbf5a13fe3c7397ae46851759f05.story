Despite a late rally from Ryan LaFlare in the fifth round, Demian Maia looked completely dominant on his way to a unanimous victory in the main event in Rio on Saturday night.

The Brazilian jiu jitsu black belt got the American wrestler to the ground in each round and underlined his dominance by establishing the mount position in all but the final round. Threatening to finish with an arm triangle in the second and again in the fourth round, LaFlare's ability to stay in the competition nearly won him the fight as he managed to turn the tables on the Brazilian in the final act.

The American welterweight came out all guns blazing in the fifth and caught a visibly tiring Maia with some big shots to the body that forced the Brazilian to pull guard in attempt to stop LaFlare's assault in the striking department. Such was Maia's reluctance to trade with LaFlare that referee John McCarthy took a point from the veteran as he flopped to his back in the last seconds of the contest.

Taking the point away had little or no impact on the judges' scorecards in what was otherwise a one-sided affair. Speaking after the bout, Maia claimed that the fans had been his inspiration during his 'tough' camp, having only returned after battling a recent bone infection.

'First of all I have to thank everybody who stayed up late and came out here to watch the fight,' Maia told the crowd through a translator in the Ginásio do Maracanãzinho. 'I was out for three months, I had a serious infection so I had a very tough camp and I came in and fought a guy who was undefeated, a very tough fighter. The public, the fans, they were my motivation.'

Asked who he would like to face next, Maia wasn't specific when it came to names but declared interest in another main event or co-main event slot in the future.

He said: 'I'd like to have another good fight, maybe a co-main event or another main event. I was just really happy to come out here and fight in the birthplace of jiujitsu. Helio Gracie, Carlos Gracie and a lot of to jiu jitsu guys have fought here, so it's an honour to fight here.'

Meanwhile in the co-main event, Erick Silva banked his sixth UFC first round finish after an exciting fire fight with UFC veteran Josh Koscheck. With both fighters throwing caution to the wind during the bout, Silva managed to get Koscheck's attention with a straight left hand just shy of the three-minute mark.

As Koscheck attempted to close the distance, Silva cleverly wrapped up a guillotine choke, which he adapted as the AKA fighter pummelled him against the fence. Jumping guard with the choke locked in, Silva forced the tap from the UFC veteran who has now lost five fights in a row.
