Diego Lopez insisted that despite an indifferent start to the season, AC Milan have a squad that is strong enough to finish in the top three of Serie A and qualify for next season's Champions League.

The former Real Madrid goalkeeper signed for Milan in the summer after the arrival of Keylor Navas in the Spanish capital.

After spending the early part of the season as understudy to veteran stopper Christian Abbiati, the 33-year-old has excelled as first choice - keeping two cleansheets in his last three appearances.

Lopez kept Iker Casillas out of the Madrid side for much of last season

And buoyed by last weekend's victory over top three rivals Napoli, Lopez has set his sights on European football next season.

'Yes, of course (we can finish in the top three), but it will be tough. There are plenty of teams who have Champions League ambitions,' Lopez told Tuttosport

'Napoli remain perhaps the most credible rival, but Inter and Fiorentina are ascending. Genoa and Lazio are also playing very well.'

The top half of Serie A shows there is still much work to do for Milan

On the back of that impressive display against Napoli, Lopez feels that the Rossoneri's trip to face second-placed Roma on Sunday provides them with an opportunity to test themselves against one of the league's best.

'For us it will be a great opportunity to continue on the path of growth,' Lopez added.

'After beating Napoli, we will have to go to the Olimpico and look for three points. It will not be be easy, but we will try even though we face a team that will fight Juventus for the title until the end.'

Despite a great deal of competition, Lopez still harbours hope that playing consistently for the Serie A outfit will enhance his chances of earning a place in the Spain squad.

'The national team? I was unfortunate, with (Iker) Casillas, (Victor) Valdes, (Pepe) Reina and (David) De Gea.

'Maybe playing with continuity in Milan will help me go to the Euro 2016.'
