The Indian cricket team has issued a fastidious list of dietary demands to the venues hosting their upcoming test match tour of Australia.

The team distributed a document which lists an embargo on all spicy and fried foods, along with severe hygienic measures, in a bid to ensure none of the players suffer gastric upset on the field.

The team have demanded that all hot dishes are served at more than 60 degrees Celsius, and cold ones set out below five degrees Celsius, reports News.com.

The team distributed a document which lists an embargo on all spicy and fried foods,with only mild curries deemed acceptable

Further exacting hygiene demands included the following.

'All utensils should look clean and have no food or anything else visible,' 'all staff must wash their hands thoroughly with warm, soapy water,' and 'utensils must be sanitised in a dishwasher at high heat and must be dried before use, with air drying the best method.'

As well as the prohibitions, the documents requests an exorbitant all-day menu which includes beans, salmon, low-fat cheese, poached eggs and grilled mushrooms, with any other foods served must be approved by team management first.

During the test Match series of 2011-2012, there were complaints of too much Indian food on the menu for both teams, with Perth chef Gogo Govardhan catering the shared buffet.

The English team issued even more elaborate demands last year in an 82 page document which requested pumpkin seed and goji berry breakfast bars and mungbean curry with spinach.

The four match test series begins at the Gabba in Brisbane on December 4.
