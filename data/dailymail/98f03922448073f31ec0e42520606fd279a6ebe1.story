Sarah McClay, a zookeeper, who was mauled to death at South Lakes Animal Park by a Sumatran tiger  

The colleague of a zookeeper who was mauled to death by a tiger has told her inquest the big cat that attacked her was on a 'starve day' to recreate conditions in the wild.

Sarah McClay, 24, was attacked in the big cat enclosure at South Lakes Wild Animal Park in Dalton-in-Furness, Cumbria, on May 24 last year.

She was going about her routine duties at the park when she was mauled by a male Sumatran tiger called Padang. She was taken by air ambulance to Royal Preston Hospital but later died from her injuries.

At day two of an inquest into her death at South Cumbria Coroner's Court, colleague Emma Els told of how the two Sumatran tigers at the park were on a starve day, a tactic employed once a week to mimic the conditions of the wild.

The inquest also heard how there had been a leg of meat in the keepers' corridor of the tiger house and the cats with their incredible sense of smell, would have sensed it.

The hearing heard how Mrs Els had been in the tiger house to carry out some greasing of doors and had spoken with Miss McClay, who was the cat keeper on the day of the incident.

Mrs Els, had run out of grease when she came to work on the doors in the Sumatran tiger side of the building.

She said she left the tiger house and went to a digger working on the site, where a member of staff changed the cartridge, before she headed back.

Speaking through her tears, Mrs Els, who was an animal carer at the zoo with around six years' experience, told the inquest: 'There were people outside. Somebody had shouted "the tiger is out", but people were always making jokes saying "there's a cat behind the window" and making jokes like that, so it took me a second to realise.

'But as I got closer, I could see there was something completely wrong. I started running towards the tiger house and, as I got to the viewing window, there was a Sumatran tiger.

'I could see a Sumatran in that room and she was on her back with the tiger behind her and I remember shouting on the radio "Padang has got Sarah, we need help".'

The inquest also heard evidence from Mrs Els' husband Cornelius, who was a maintenance man at the zoo.

He heard over the radio that there had been an emergency and ran to the tiger house.

He said: 'I heard my wife come on the radio. I couldn't quite hear what was the problem the first time because she was distressed.

A post mortem examination found Miss McClay died from ‘multiple injuries’ which the pathologist described as ‘unsurvivable’

'The second message said the tiger had got Sarah.'

He added that staff went to get the firearms and he asked a colleague for a crow bar so they could force entry to the tiger building.

Once inside, he secured door D2 - where witness Gareth Bell had seen a tiger take Miss McClay.

He said door D1 was already secure, but doors G2 and G1 were open.

A post mortem examination found Miss McClay died from ‘multiple injuries’ which the pathologist described as ‘unsurvivable’.

The inquest continues.
