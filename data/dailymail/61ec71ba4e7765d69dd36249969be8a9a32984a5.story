Roma midfielder Kevin Strootman has dismissed talk of a transfer to Manchester United, insisting it would be 'disrespectful' to be discussing a move at this time. 

The 24-year-old has long been linked with the Red Devils and speculation has mounted further since his former Holland manager Louis van Gaal took over  at Old Trafford.

Strootman, however, has just returned from a long-term cruciate ligament injury that ruled him out of the World Cup, and says his primary focus is on playing for Roma and getting back to his best.

'I want to play more, and return to my best level,' Strootman told Sky Italia. 'I’ve signed up for five years, but so far I’ve only been playing for six or seven months. I want to play and help the team. That’s important to me.

'If I spoke about other clubs that would be disrespectful, and I don’t want to do that.'
