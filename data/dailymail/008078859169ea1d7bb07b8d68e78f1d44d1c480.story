In a bid to counter the soaring popularity of short term accommodation websites, the NSW council have started handing out over $1 million to those offering unregistered rooms on sites like Airbnb.

Residents are reporting being contacted by the local council because the accommodation they offer is not a legitimate bed and breakfast.

Others have requested home owners become meet these standards in order to continue renting rooms-a process which often includes expensive renovations like fitting commercial kitchens.

Councils in NSW are tightening up on sites like Airbnb by issuing hefty fines to those who offer unregistered rooms, pressuring them to register with their local council

Since launching in 2008, Airbnb has since amassed over 500,000 listings in 33,000 cities and 192 countries. But the rapid rise to prominence has seen a phenomenon that has been deemed as 'growth pains.'

According to an American study from Skift, Airbnb has made 'local municipalities eager for tax revenue, either in the form of income tax from the owners who use the site or from Airbnb based on arguments that it acts more like a hotel offering inventory than a classified advertising site.

This week, a study from Fairfax shows this phenomenon appears to have reached Australia, with local councils tightening up on unregistered rooms.

Newton local Lynn Statton said her local council told her 'If we approve you as a bed and breakfast you can in the future serve hot breakfast and you'll be needing a hygienic commercial kitchen.'

Statton typically offered fruit, muesli and bread for guests to help themselves-rather than a hot breakfast. She said her council said 'there's not much cooking involved there.'

The registration costs and revenue tax varies from council to council. But the fines for continuing to rent unregistered short term accommodation are becoming ubiquitously severe.

One resident called Shauna, who chose to keep her full name disclosed, told Fairfax she was contacted with a letter warning she has 10 days to say why her council should not take legal action against her, and that she is facing fines of f $1.1 million plus an additional $110,000 a day.

Planning Minister Pru Goward said NSW council has 'not caught up with the rapid development of the collaborative consumption market led by companies like Airbnb'

'It was quite a shocking letter to get. I immediately saw $1.1 million and thought 'what am I going to do?' '

'I feel like they're making the rules up as they go along because they have no clear guidelines yet,' 

Sam McDonagh, Airbnb's country manager for Australia and New Zealand, argued the framework in NSW  was not as clear as in other states.

'Queensland and Victoria both already have clear rules that allow people to rent out their homes for any period of time,' he said.

Planning Minister Pru Goward said NSW council has 'not caught up with the rapid development of the collaborative consumption market led by companies like Airbnb'.
