Its head-turning billboards sky-rocketed Wonderbra into the forefront of the women's lingerie market where it's remained for 20 years.

And now the cleavage creator is celebrating two decades in affluent business with a birthday cake and catwalk show in Madrid.

The presentation was held at Ramses Club in the Spanish city on Wednesday, and saw an array of models clad in various styles from its current collection celebrate in style as they blew out candles.

Wonderbra's 'Hello Boys' advert was the 1994 billboard that - quite literally - stopped traffic

The Wonderbra name was first trademarked in the U.S. in 1955, and the brand was developed in Canada over the next 40 years. But it only really gained worldwide prominence in the 1990s.

The bra's redesign and reintroduction in 1994 saw a £16m advertising campaign in the US and UK including billboards showing models wearing only the Wonderbra. 

Underneath read slogans such as 'who cares if it's a bad hair day?' and 'look me in the eyes and tell me that you love me'.

Wonderbra's iconic Hello Boys advert was the 1994 billboard that - quite literally - stopped traffic. 

Makers of the ad were honoured in 2011, when the billboard was declared the most eye-catching ad of the previous 20 years.

Appraisal from ad professionals aside, the Hello Boys poster aroused the ire of feminists, many of whom described it as degrading.

But Eva Herzigova, the model who starred in the ad, opened up about the criticism she received at the time and said far from being degrading, it was actually empowering.

'My Wonderbra campaign empowered women,' said Czech-born Eva, 43. 

'It didn’t degrade them like some said or say.

Speaking to the Evening Standard, she continued: 'It was controversial at the time, sure - but it made waves and you can see its influence still today.

 'It was one of the most successful advertising campaigns in history and I am so proud to be a part of it.'

The advert, which was shot by Ellen von Unwerth and saw Eva posing in a black Wonderbra and pants, certainly split opinion.

Some claimed the racy ad was derogatory towards women, even as they flocked to buy the bra in their millions. 

Much of the controversy centred on traffic accidents, with some commuters blaming the huge roadside poster for their lack of concentration.

Wonderbra remains a leading brand in the women's lingerie market.
