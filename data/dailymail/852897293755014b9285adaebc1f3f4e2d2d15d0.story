The next 9/11-style terrorist attack will come from Iraq and Syria if the Iraqi government collapses, Senator Lindsey Graham said on Sunday.

'According
 to our own Director of National Intelligence, FBI director, 
the next 9/11 is coming from here,' Graham (R-S.C.) said to Bob Schieffer on CBS's 'Face the Nation.' 

When asked about his personal opinion, Graham said he agreed with that statement and that another 9/11 attack was 'inevitable.' 

'The seeds of 9/11s are being planted all over Iraq and Syria,' he said.

Graham made the remarks while speaking about militant Sunni group the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria's (ISIS) movement toward Baghdad.

'You
 don't have to believe me,' Graham continued. 'This is what they're telling 
you they're going to do. They're not hiding their agenda. They want an 
Islamic caliphate that runs through Syria and Iraq.

'They're
 going to take the king of Jordan down because he's an infidel in their 
eyes as much as we are and they plan to drive us out of the Mideast by 
attacking us here at home.'

Graham also said the United States' '[needs] air power immediately to stop the [ISIS] advance toward Baghdad.'

ISIS, he said, will also move into Jordan and Lebanon.

While speaking on 'Face the Nation,' Graham criticized the leadership of Shiite Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's leadership - and said he must step down.

'Maliki is a flawed, leader, Bob. He - he has to go. There's no way that Maliki can bring this country back together,' Graham said on the CBS program.

Though Graham advocated air support in Baghdad, he noted the possibility of civilian casualties.

'The Iraqi Air Force is basically grounded,' he said. 'Without American air power it's going to be hard to turn the tide.'

Graham said the US will 'probably' need help from the Sunni Iranians, whom he said wanted southern Iraq, but compared the partnership to working with Stalin during World War II.

 'We're going to have to have some dialogue with Iranians that say, let's coordinate our efforts, but put a redline to the Iranians,' he said. 'Don't use this crisis to take territory from the Iraqi people.'
