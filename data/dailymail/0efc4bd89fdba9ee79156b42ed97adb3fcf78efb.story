Britain’s Max Chilton has been unexpectedly dropped for this weekend’s Belgian Grand Prix.

Chilton, in his second full season on the Formula One grid with backmarkers’ Marussia, will be replaced by Alexander Rossi, who makes his grand prix debut.

Marussia have revealed there are ‘contractual issues’ behind the decision to axe Chilton, while the Briton claims he 'volunteered' to give up his drive in order for the team to raise 'much-needed funds'.

Business as usual: Max Chilton takes part in his track walk at Spa-Francorchamps on Thursday morning 

A statement released on behalf of the Englishman said: 'Max Chilton has volunteered to step out of his race seat for this weekend's race in Spa, Belgium to allow the team to attract much needed funds by selling his seat.

'Max will attend the race and be on hand to support the team in any way possible. Marussia are currently in talks with several new investors and it is expected the situation will be resolved before the next race in Monza.' 

American Rossi, 23 next month, will be the second rookie on the grid in Spa-Francorchamps after Caterham revealed on Wednesday that 32-year-old Andre Lotterer will replace Kamui Kobayahsi for round 11 of the championship. 

‘We're providing Alexander Rossi with the opportunity to make his Grand Prix debut at this weekend’s Belgian Grand Prix in Spa-Francorchamps,’ said Marussia.

‘Alexander will race alongside Jules Bianchi, substituting for Max Chilton while contractual issues are resolved.

‘Alexander joined the team as reserve driver last month, the announcement coming at the Hungarian Grand Prix. He has taken part in a number of Friday morning Free Practice 1 sessions with his previous team but this weekend will see him ‘racing’ a Formula One car for the first time.’

Rossi added: 'It goes without saying that I am thrilled to be given the opportunity to race in Formula One for the first time and I cannot thank the Marussia F1 Team for the faith they are demonstrating in me. 

'It’s a very big moment for me and there’s a lot to prepare in a short space of time, but on the other hand I have felt ready for this for quite a while now. It is also exciting to be given this opportunity at such a fantastic and historical circuit as Spa-Francorchamps.'
