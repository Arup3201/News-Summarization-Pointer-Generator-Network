Dazzling bride Liu Cheng made sure she would not be shown up on her big day by donning Â£200,000 of solid gold jewellery to walk down the aisle.

The one-woman Bling Dynasty, from Quanzhou in southern China's Fujian province, staggered to her groom with more than five kilos of necklaces, bracelets, gems, and rings dangling from her body.

Proud mum Lin Hu, who spent more than an hour helping her 26-year-old daughter get into her jewellery, explained: 'I wanted to make the day as special as I could for my girl.

'I've been collecting these pieces for years, and I got my relatives to do so as well because its important to show her new relatives that she comes from a good family.

'We would save money and when the gold price was low we would buy - and sometimes when it was high we would sell to have cash to buy more gold later - it worked really well.'
