Entertainment reporter Michael Ausiello has revealed in a moving online post that he is taking time off as his husband reaches the end of his cancer battle.

Ausiello, a former TV Guide and Entertainment Weekly reporter, made the announcement on his television website, TVLine.com, on Thursday.

He revealed that his husband, photographer Kit Cowan, 41, has been battling against 'a rare and aggressive Neuroendocrine cancer' for the past nine months.

'As that fight approaches its end, I'll be taking a little time off,' he wrote.

The couple met in 2001 - when TV-loving Ausiello was shocked to learn Cowan didn't own a television set - and they married earlier this year.

In his post, Ausiello praised Cowan for helping him to create his media empire, explaining that if any reader has admired any work on his website, Cowan likely had a hand in it.

'A key driving force behind the "Ausiello brand" has been someone who has largely remained behind the scenes,' he wrote. 'He's one of the most talented designers/photographers/purveyors of good taste on the planet. He's also, as luck would have it, my husband.'

He credited him with helping him make 'every major design decision' at TVLine, as well as giving him advice during his time at Entertainment Weekly and TVGuide.

'If I looked halfway decent while talking about TV on a morning show or Entertainment Tonight-type news magazine, you better believe Kit chose my outfit,' he wrote.

He said that his team at TVLine would keep the stories coming during his absence.

Ausiello, 42, shared few details about Cowan's illness. Neuroendocrine cancer occurs in cells in the hormonal and nervous systems, and are often found in the intestines or lungs.

Cowan, who is from Millersburg, Pennsylvania, is a photographer and designer, and owner of a stationery company. He and Ausiello live in New York City.

The New Jersey-born reporter got his start writing for Soap Opera Update and Soaps in Depth, then landed at TV Guide where he launched a spoiler column, 'Ask Ausiello'.

After his time at Entertainment Weekly, he launched TVLine in 2010.

He has also had small parts on some of his favorite shows, including Scrubs, Veronica Mars and Gilmore Girls.
