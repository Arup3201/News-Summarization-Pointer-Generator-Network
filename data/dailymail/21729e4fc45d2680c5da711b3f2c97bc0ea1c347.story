Among the famous people born and raised during the time of the British Raj in India, one man in particular provides a surprising connection between two current British figures.

During the digitisation of millions of British in India records, genealogy site Findmypast.co.uk discovered that the Prime Minister David Cameron is a blood relative of 'pub landlord' comedian Al Murray.

The records revealed that Cameron is a distant cousin of Murray and that the pair share the same six times great grandfather, author William Makepeace Thackery.

The British Raj was the British rule in the Indian subcontinent between 1858 and 1947.

The system of governance was instituted in 1858, after the Indian Rebellion of 1857, when the rule of the British East India Company was transferred to the Crown and lasted until 1947.

In 1947 the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two sovereign dominion states, the Union of India (later the Republic of India) and the Dominion of Pakistan (later the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, the eastern half of which, still later, became the People's Republic of Bangladesh).

The British Raj extended over almost all present-day India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, with exceptions such as Goa.

The ruler was Queen Victoria, who in 1876 was proclaimed Empress of India.

Thackeray is also famous in his own right, as the 19th century poet and author of satirical novel Vanity Fair. 

Elsewhere, John Talbot Shakespear, David Cameron’s four times great grandfather and Thackeray’s uncle, was a senior civil servant with the East India Company.

The records also reveal details about Charles and Robert Bruce, two Scottish brothers who established the first commercial tea plantation for the East India Company.

They were among the first to discover tea plants being grown by the local population in Assam, a north-eastern state in India. Today, over half of India’s output of tea comes from this region.

Findmypast’s project to digitise the 2.5 
million records covering Indian history between 1698 to 1974 was carried
 out in partnership with the British Library. 

It is the first time the records have been made available online, having previously only been accessible as original documents or on microfilm at the British Library’s Reading Rooms in St. Pancras.

Other interesting finds within the records include the baptism records of Rudyard Kipling, author of the Jungle Book.

Kipling was born in Bombay, in the Bombay Presidency of British India, in 1865 but was sent to school in to England when he was five years old.

Kipling’s sister Trix’s wedding records were also found, as were inventories of Kipling’s estate.

During another investigation into the 200-year records, the researchers found evidence of a close relationship between Napoleon Bonaparte and a young teenage girl called Betsy Balcombe.

Napoleon spent six years in captivity on the small island of St. Helena and during that time he recorded various memoirs.

It’s long been known he had a close relationship with Balcombe, who was daughter of an English merchant, and the young girl is said to have helped Napoleon learn English, and called him ‘Boney’.

Yet these records reveal how long that bond lasted. According to the archives, Napoleon’s nephew, Napoleon III wrote he intended to leave Balcombe 500 hectares of land with vineyards in Algeria in memory of her comfort to his uncle.

Other notable birth records, letters and references including Spike Milligan as well as George Orwell, who features in the records under his given name Eric Blair.

‘The period covered by these records was absolutely fascinating and includes some of the most important events in the history of the British Empire’ said Debra Chatfield from findmypast.

‘The 2.5 million records cover every aspect of life, and provide snapshots of those at the top, middle and bottom of society.

‘These vividly detailed records will help to unlock family mysteries and overcome dead ends in research, as family history enthusiasts can now go beyond the boundaries of UK family history and look further afield than ever before. The British in India collection really is a goldmine of enthralling lives and stories just waiting to be explored.’
