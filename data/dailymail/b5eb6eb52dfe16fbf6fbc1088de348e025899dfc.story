The Duke of Cambridge stepped in to help his over-heating wife today as they cheered on a Welsh swimmer during their visit to the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.

Prince William, who was joined by his brother Prince Harry, repeatedly fanned Kate using her identity card as they watched Jazz Carlin win the 800m freestyle gold medal at Tollcross Swimming Centre.

Donning a blue top, jeans and wedges, the Duchess was pictured pulling a silly face as she was cooled down by her husband and a poolside official. Just minutes earlier, she had made a very public display of affection by clasping the Duke's hand, before laying her hand on his leg.

Earlier in the day, the royal couple, joined by Prince Harry, were spotted singing along to the chorus of the Proclaimers' I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles) track between rotations at the Games, which were opened by The Queen last week and have attracted huge crowds.

Earlier in the day, the Duchess of Cambridge had to cover her eyes as she, Prince William and Prince Harry watched the boxing during their visit to the Games

The Duchess looked on in horror as English boxer Scott Fitzgerald slugged it out with Azumah Mohammed of Ghana in a welterweight clash in the SECC arena

William,
 wearing an open-necked white shirt, Kate and Harry stayed at the boxing
 for around 45 minutes before leaving for another venue

The
 three royals' stunned faces turned to cheers as Fitzgerald recorded a 
unanimous points win over Mohammed in a bruising encounter

Prince
 William, who will one day be the head of state for nearly all of the 
countries taking part in the games,  kept his cheering diplomatically 
neutral rather than risk causing offence.

The
 artistic gymnastics was the first of several sessions that William, 
Kate and Harry attended as competition on day five of the Commonwealth 
Games continued.

As
 with the boxing, their arrival at the Hydro went almost unnoticed by 
the crowds until cameras showed them on the arena's big screens. 
Spectators broke into applause as a close-up of the Duke and Duchess and
 Harry flashed up.

The
 royal couple's son, Prince George, who celebrated his first birthday 
last week, was left at home in London in the care of his nanny, Maria 
Teresa Turrion Borrallo. Perhaps unsurprisingly, young parents William 
and Kate seemed distracted by their phones at certain points during the 
day.

The Duchess was also pictured placing her hand over her mouth as she watched the women's hockey during the visit to the Commonwealth Games

During the game, which saw Scotland's women's hockey team take on Wales, many spectators gasped and raised the hands to their faces

Kate winces and William presses his lips together as they watch the hockey alongside hundreds of spectators it the Glasgow venue this afternoon

During their visit, the couple also watched Scotland's women hockey team take on Wales, prompting Kate to grimace and gasp again. Earlier in the day, Prince Harry had met up with the Australian and England hockey teams.

They were also presented with an Australian 
team mascot - a yellow toy kangaroo - during their visit to Tollcross Swimming Centre.

William and Kate are often seen at big sporting events and were spotted hugging in 
celebration as they cheered on Chris Hoy and Team GB's cyclists at the 
London Olympics.

As
 well as regularly being spotted in the Royal Box at Wimbledon, Prince 
William often attends England football matches in his role as FA 
President.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge became the latest royals to visit the Commonwealth Games in Scotland today as they took their seats in Glasgow

After
 flying into Scotland, the young royals shared a joke as they prepared 
for an afternoon of sporting action, starting with the men's artistic 
gymnastics

The royal couple have been regulars at British sporting occasions since their wedding, attending London 2012, Wimbledon and a number of football and rugby matches

The crowd at the Hydro arena failed to notice the royals sneak in but gave an enthusiastic cheer when Harry, Kate and then Wills appeared on a big screen

Prince
 William kept it casual in jeans and a white shirt while the Duchess of 
Cambridge wore dark jeans, a navy blue blaze and her now-patented wedges

Since the Queen opened the event last week, the Commonwealth Games has proved popular with royal visitors, starting with Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, who kicked off a week of royal visits the day before the event got underway.

During their visit, the royal couple were introduced to competitors from all over the Commonwealth, with the prince stopping to engage in a mock sparring session with Jamaican boxer Cheavon Clarke.

Other royals to be seen cheering on the 
athletes in Glasgow include the Queen, who joined the crowds at the 
hockey and the swimming on last Thursday, and the Earl and Countess of 
Wessex, who were seen over the weekend at the hockey and the rugby 
sevens.

Harry,
 Kate and Wills are latest royals to visit the Glasgow games following 
the Queen, who opened the event last week, and Prince Charles and the 
Duchess of Cornwall

Prince George stayed at home with his nanny but young parents Kate and William seemed distracted by their phones and repeatedly showed uncle Harry the screen

Prince William checked his phone (left) before showing his wife the screen (right) as they watched the men's artistic gymnastics at the Games

After chatting to those seated nearby, the trio clapped along to unofficial Scottish anthem the Proclaimers' I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles) between the gymnastic rotations

The royal couple were joined by Prince William's brother, Prince Harry, as they sat down to watch the men's individual qualifiers for artistic gymnastics

Prince Harry arrived separately from his brother and Kate, who was wearing a Zara double breasted blazer from NZ, J Brand jeans and Stuart Weitzman wedges

Wills and 
Kate's appearance at the games came as Dan Greaves struck gold for 
England with victory in the F42/44 discus at a noisy Hampden Park.

The
 31-year-old, who took silver at London 2012, came out on top of his 
domestic duel with Wales' Aled Davies, winning with a throw of 59.21 
metres.

Greaves 
admitted success in Glasgow trumped his London podium finish, saying: 
'This surpasses everything in the last couple of years. To get the first
 gold of England's campaign in track and field is such an honour.'

One
 of the standout stars of the games so far has been 13-year-old Erraid 
Davies, 13, who became the competition's youngest ever medal winner when
 she came third in the para-sport 100 metres breaststroke.

Also
 at the games were Prince Edward, top row left, his wife Sophie, Duchess
 of Wessex, top row second right, and daughter Lady Louise Windsor, top 
row second left

On
 a busy day for royals at the games, Edward and Sophie were seen 
chatting to their daughter during the women's hockey match between 
Australia and England

Lady
 Louise, famously a bridesmaid at Kate and Wills's wedding, struggled to
 stay enthused throughout the whole match as England struggled against 
the Aussies

The
 royal visit came as discus thrower Dan Greaves won England's first 
Commonwealth gold in the track and field after throwing a distance of 
59.21 metres

Greaves, who was born with a deformity of the feet, won gold in the Athens Paralympics ten years ago but narrowly missed out on top spot at London 2012, taking silver

The 31-year-old said: 'This is my first multi-sport able-bodied Games, and it feels so good to come away with something I've worked so hard for'

Meanwhile, Welsh swimmer Jazz Carlin set a new Commonwealth Games record in qualifying for tonight’s 800m freestyle final.

And Laura Trott, Siobhan-Marie O’Connor and Fran Halsall helped make it another golden day for England yesterday.

The
 Glasgow games have already broken Scottish visitor records with more 
than 350,000 spectators watching events yesterday on so-called 'Super 
Sunday'.
