Liverpool are heading for Miami to do battle with arch rivals Manchester United on Monday after a comfortable 2-0 win over a dismal AC Milan side in Charlotte.

Goals from Joe Allen and Suso made it three wins out of three for Brendan Rodgers' men in the International Champions Cup.

Liverpool were already assured of top spot in their group following Manchester City's 5-4 defeat to Olympiacos on penalties earlier in the day after it had finished 2-2.

LIVERPOOL: Mignolet, Kelly (Johnson 60), Toure (Sakho 60), Coates (Skrtel 60), Robinson Enrique 60), Lucas (Gerrard 60), Henderson (Suso 46), Allen (Can 60), Lambert (Peterson 60), Ibe (Coutinho 60), Sterling (Coady 46). 

Goals: Allen (17), Suso (89).

AC MILAN: Abbiati (Gabriel 46), Abate (Zapate 80), Bonera, Rami (Mexes 66), De Sciglio, Essien (Cristante 66), Muntari (Poli 80), Saponara, Niang, Pazzini (Balotelli 46), El Shaarway (Honda 66).

Referee: David Gantar 

However, they made no mistake in front of a 70,000-strong crowd at the Bank of America Stadium as they easily dealt with the challenge of Milan, who had already been heavily beaten by Olympiacos and Man City.

Rodgers used no fewer than 21 players to ensure his squad is ready for the first showdown with United since Louis van Gaal's appointment as David Moyes' successor.

With Daniel Sturridge ruled out with a minor knock sustained in training and £20million new boy Lazar Markovic sidelined by a tendon problem, Liverpool made five changes following the win over Manchester City in New York.

Brad Jones, Jose Enrique, Steven Gerrard, Philippe Coutinho and Sturridge were replaced by Simon Mignolet, Jack Robinson, Lucas Leiva, Jordon Ibe and Raheem Sterling.

Lightning-quick teenage wingers Ibe and Sterling lit up the opening 45 minutes as their pace tormented Milan's overworked backline.

Liverpool were in control from the start and took the lead in the 17th minute.

Big crowd: Kolo Toure lead the team out in Charlotte on Saturday

Relaxed: Already in the final, Brendan Rodgers was able to give Steven Gerrard a rest

Allen's work rate created the chance as he dispossessed former Chelsea midfielder Michael Essien and burst clear.

The Wales international fired against the woodwork and Sterling's effort from the follow up was blocked by Christian Abbiati.

The ball fell back into the path of Allen, who volleyed home in style.

Sterling was then denied by Abbiati before Kolo Toure made a crucial tackle to thwart Giampaolo Saponara at the other end.

Ibe, who enjoyed a beneficial loan spell at Birmingham City last season, showcased his exciting potential.

The youngster was on the receiving end of some rough treatment from former Portsmouth man Sulley Muntari but he picked himself up and battled on.

Keeping tabs: The Liverpool manager and his backroom staff observe the game

Ibe began the attack which should have yielded a second goal in the 27th minute. He raced 50 yards before linking up with Lambert and Sterling, who was pulled to the ground by Adil Rami.

Lambert, who never missed in his 34 penalties for Southampton, took responsibility but his spot-kick was kept out by Abbiati.

Milan did threaten just before the break but Mignolet grabbed Mbaya Niang's strike at the second attempt and Allen dealt with the danger after Stephan El Shaarawy raced into the penalty area.

Suso and Conor Coady came on for Henderson and Sterling as Rodgers began to rest players with one eye on Monday's final in Miami.

There were eight more changes on the hour mark with the introduction of Steven Gerrard receiving a rapturous ovation from the 70,000-strong crowd.

The raft of subs dented the flow of the game and chances were at a premium.

Ibe continued to shine with another classy burst down the left as he got the better of Rami but Milan survived.

Gerrard sparked panic with a through ball to Suso which triggered a thundering collision between Gabriel and Mattia De Sciglio.

The Liverpool skipper went close from long range before Milan threatened to restore parity.

Mbaye Niang went clean through but Mignolet raced out and made a brave sprawling save.

Muntari's strike was then deflected wide before Liverpool killed off the Italians in the 89th minute.

Coutinho raced into space down the left and teed up Suso, who swept a low left-footer into the far corner.

Mignolet's stunning finger tip save denied Bryan Cristante deep into stoppage time as Liverpool march on to Miami on a high.
