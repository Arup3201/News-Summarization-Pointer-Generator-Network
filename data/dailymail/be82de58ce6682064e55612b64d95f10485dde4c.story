On the mend: Jonathan Vermont is back on his feet after his near-death-experience with sepsis

The tiny scar on Jonathan Vermont’s hand barely merits  a second glance. 

Yet because of this minute cut – just half an inch long – he almost lost his life.

Barely a month ago he was lying in a hospital bed hovering between life and death, his body ravaged by sepsis, a blood condition that seriously affects at least 100,000 people every year in the UK and kills almost 40,000.

And Jonathan, 22, a graduate and keen rugby player from Leatherhead in Surrey, was very lucky.

His condition was diagnosed just in time to administer the intravenous antibiotics that saved his life.

A new Health Service Ombudsman report states that a third of the 37,000 deaths from sepsis every year are a direct result of misdiagnosis or poor treatment.

Substandard care in sepsis is costing the NHS £2.5 billion a year.

Sepsis – formerly known as septicaemia – occurs when the body starts to attack its own organs and tissues as the immune system responds to micro-organisms such as bacteria that are already causing infection.

Initial symptoms include feeling as though you have flu, but in extreme cases blood pressure plummets so low that vital organs are deprived of blood and shut down.

Those with mild sepsis may be safely treated with antibiotics at home, but others require urgent hospital care.

‘It is more common than heart attacks and more deadly than a stroke,’ says Dr Matt Morgan, an intensive care doctor at Cardiff University School of Medicine, who is campaigning with the UK Sepsis Trust to raise awareness of the condition and for research funds.

‘It kills more people every year than bowel, prostate and breast cancer combined, but it  is poorly funded and diagnostic techniques are pre-Victorian.’

Normally, sepsis affects the elderly or those with existing illnesses such as diabetes, kidney problems or pneumonia. But the fact that Jonathan developed it from an innocuous injury is a warning to us all.

‘I was scratched while training with 
my rugby club in Dorking last month, during a scrum,’ he says. 
‘Somebody’s finger must have just caught my hand. I didn’t think 
anything of it at all.’

Just in time: As a result of the initial misdiagnosis for the sepsis as soft tissue infection, Jonathan was just hours from organ failure before given correct treatment

But 48 hours later, while walking his dog, he was startled to notice that his hand had swollen.

Overnight the swelling worsened and Jonathan’s hand and arm ballooned up to his elbow. ‘It felt hot, throbbed with  pain and I couldn’t move my fingers,’ he says.

His anxious girlfriend Beth, 21, who works for a sports tour company, texted a picture to her mother, who works in a hospital.

Within minutes of receiving her reply, Jonathan and Beth were rushing to A&E at Epsom Hospital, where he was diagnosed with cellulitis – an infection of  the soft tissue – and transferred to St Helier Hospital in nearby Carshalton.

Sepsis occurs when the  body responds to infection,  and can be caused by a huge variety of bacteria – such as  C.diff, E.coli, streptococcus or MRSA.

Chemicals released into the blood to combat the  infection trigger widespread inflammation, which leads to blood clots and leaky vessels.

Symptoms include a very high or low temperature, fast breathing, racing heartbeat, confusion or slurred speech. The skin may also be cool,  pale or mottled, and in  advanced stages the patient  can lose consciousness.

About 100,000 people are admitted to hospital with  sepsis each year. Patients with the condition occupy more  than 30 per cent of intensive  care unit beds.

Four days later he went home, believing it was all over. But the next morning, Jonathan felt as  if he had flu. ‘I had a soaring temperature, a headache and a sore throat. I felt dreadful,’ he says.

Again he was persuaded by his girlfriend to go to hospital, where a blood test was taken. ‘Initially –  and confusingly, given that they had my discharge papers from the previous day – I was told I probably had tonsillitis. But then I was admitted to a ward.’

Analysis of his blood had shown that  he was in the middle of a dangerous attack of sepsis and just hours from organ failure. ‘I was barely functioning but I remember Beth phoning me, crying that I might die,’ Jonathan says.

The confusion over his diagnosis exemplifies the lack of awareness of sepsis, according  to Dr Ron Daniels, consultant in intensive care at Good Hope Hospital in Birmingham and chief executive of the Sepsis Trust.

‘It ought to have been the first assumption,’ he says. ‘All medical professionals should be aware  of the subtle and fast-changing symptoms and do the necessary tests as soon as it is even suspected. These include blood tests for abnormal white cell count and lactic acid levels – high levels mean organs may not be receiving enough oxygen – as well as physiological observations such as heart rate and temperature.

‘The earlier the condition is caught, the better. In severe cases, every hour’s delay increases the risk of death by eight per cent and it is a tragic reality that  often a patient isn’t referred quickly enough.

‘It can take up to 72 hours to diagnose, by which point the organs may have started to shut down. If you think you or a relative may have sepsis, don’t hesitate to suggest it to a doctor.’

It is thought that by improving the speed of diagnosis, the NHS might save £170 million  a year.

After four days of aggressive intravenous antibiotics, Jonathan was well enough to go home.

‘I hope that my experience may warn others,’ he says. ‘I’m proof that anyone can get sepsis, and I’m very grateful  not to be a statistic in  the report.’
