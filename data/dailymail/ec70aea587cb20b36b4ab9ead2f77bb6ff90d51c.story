Jamie Dornan fought off tough competition to land the coveted role of billionaire bondage fanatic Christian Grey in E.L. James' Fifty Shades Of Grey movie and judging by his latest modelling shots, it's clear to see why he was chosen.

The Northern Irish actor has been unveiled as the new face of Hogan's SS14 campaign in all his chiselled glory.

Shot by photographer Alasdair McLellan, the campaign features the 31-year-old posing against the romantic backdrop of Venice, Italy.

In teaser video, Dornan plays a game of hide-and-seek with model Constance Jablonski around the romantic city.

Speaking about the Hollywood heartthrob's efforts, a spokesperson for the brand said: 'Dornan's intense charisma gives all the shots a modern sophistication that perfectly translates into Hogan's unique contemporary lifestyle.'

Dornan said of his latest modelling gig: 'Hogan is a cool contemporary Italian brand. Certain brands sort of stand out, Hogan is one of those.'

Dornan follows in the footsteps of Cara and Poppy Delevingne and Georgia May Jagger, who have all modelled for the brand.

The new father, who welcomed a son into the world in November 2013, is no stranger to high-fashion campaigns.

He has modelled for Calvin Klein - alongside Kate Moss and Eva Mendes - as well as for Dior, Aquascutum and Armani.
