If there were any doubts that former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney wants back into the public spotlight, an opinion essay published Thursday afternoon castigating President Obama for shrinking America's military footprint should dispel them.

The Republican Party's 2012 presidential candidate opened up with both barrels on the White House, warning that 'bullying, invasion and regional wars' will ultimately become the norm if the U.S. withdraws from its historical role as the sole superpower capable of knitting together the world's fragile detente.

'The most ludicrous excuse for shrinking our military derives from the president’s thinking, he charged: "Things are much less dangerous now than they were 20 years ago, 25 years ago or 30 years ago".'

'The "safer world" trial balloon has been punctured by recent events in Ukraine, Afghanistan, Libya, Egypt, Gaza, Nigeria, Somalia, Syria and Iraq.'

Tanned, rested and ready? Romney is thrusting himself directly into the line of political fire with a full-throated complaint about the Obama administration's foreign policy and military readiness strategy

Under Obama, Romney claims, the US Army will soon shrink to its 1940 size and the Navy to its 1917 levels

In a direct reference to the central conclusion of the 9/11 Commission, he noted that '"Failures of imagination" led to tragedy 13 years ago; today, no imagination is required to picture what would descend on the United States if we let down our guard.'

Obama told an audience of Democratic donors in July that he believes Americans are concerned by 'the sense that around the world, the old order isn't holding, and we’re not quite yet to where we need to be in terms of a new order that's based on a different set of principles, that's based on a sense of common humanity, that’s based on economies that work for all people.'

That, Romney claimed in The Washington Post, is dangerous hogwash stemming from the belief that '[t]he old order ... where America’s disproportionate strength holds tyrants in check and preserves the sovereignty of nations, is to be replaced.'

And putting 'common humanity' on a pedestal, he wrote in a thinly veiled reference to the Middle Eastern turmoil pitting the self-proclaimed Islamic Republic of Iraq and Al-Sham (ISIS) against the West, 'ignores the reality that humanity is far from common in values and views.'

'Humanity may commonly agree that there is evil, but what one people calls evil another calls good,' Romney warned.

Obama and his spokespersons have framed ISIS and other global threats as a challenge to be marginalized through the collective work of aligned nations with no one at the forefront. 

His oft-mocked foreign-affairs principle of 'leading from behind' is the most commonly cited summary of the idea.

But if a 'multipolar world' were to replace 'one led by a strong United States,' Romney wrote, the other alpha dogs wouldn't necessarily be friendly nations.

'With emerging poles being China, Russia and Iran, the world would not see peace,' he predicted; 'it would see bullying, invasion and regional wars. And ultimately, one would seek to conquer the others, unleashing world war.'

The Middle Eastern turmoil unleashed simultaneously by an aspiring nuclear Iran and a mass-murderous ISIS – coupled with a Russian invasion of Ukraine – drew a dramatic crescendo from Romney, with rhetoric that sounded more like a campaign speech than a thought piece.

The U.S., he wrote, would never be left alone if it walked away.

'The history of the 20th century teaches that power-hungry tyrants ultimately feast on the appeasers,' according to Romney.

'We would be paying the cannibals to eat us last.'

He attributed that phrase to former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, who also once chaired the Republican National Committee.

The coinage, however, dates back to Winston Churchill.

Do-over: Rep. Paul Ryan, who ran as Romney's vice presidential nominee in 2012, has said he hopes the former Massachusetts governor takes another shot at winning the White House

Obama spent Thursday at a NATO conference in Wales, building bridges to a 'multipolar' approach to global conflict that Romney says would be a disastrous replacement for American supremacy

Romney used the same line in a December 2011 Fox News Channel interview, lambasting China for flooding global markets with cheap goods at the same time it devalued its currency.

'Right now, they're discounting their products on a very dramatic basis, and in doing so, closing down American businesses, killing American jobs,' he told host Greta Van Susteren during the peak of the presidential primary season.

'And we can say, "Oh, it's great, we're getting these products cheap." It's little like saying we're paying the cannibal to eat us last. It doesn't make sense.'

'That's paraphrasing Winston Churchill, by the way,' Romney added then. 'His line, not mine.'

Romney's recent reappearances on political talk shows and bloggers' front-burners comes at a time when Obama is being pilloried for failing to take action against ISIS; playing a tone-deaf round of golf after the first of two Americans were beheaded on video in Syria; and arguing that international coalition-building, not U.S. military firepower, has the best chance of restoring order in the Arab world.

If the former governor is planning to run for president again in 2016, his timing couldn't be better.

One mid-July poll from CNN and ORC International found that if the 2012 election were held again, Romney would beat Obama handily, by a 53-44 margin.

Buoyed by the changing political winds, he said two weeks ago during a West Virginia political rally that the Obama presidency has been 'a good deal worse than even I expected.'

Last week another poll found he would crush the GOP competition in a hypothetical matchup in Iowa, the hyper-important early caucus state.

Days later, he told a conservative television host that while he doesn't plan to run again, 'circumstances can change.'

But he would still lose in a national election against Hillary Clinton – by 13 points – according to the CNN/ORC poll.

Horror: When US photojournalist James Foley was executed by an ISIS jihadi on video, an aloof Obama drew jeers by rushing to play a round of golf as soon as he finished delivering a public condemnation

More hawkish than thou: Romney must stake out political territory more aggressive than Hillary Clinton's if he wants to run again, and she has swung decidedly to the right since leaving the Obama State Department

Clinton, the former secretary of state has made her own headlines in the last month by courting friction with the Obama White House over foreign policy issues during a wide-ranging interview in The Atlantic.

Obama's 'failure' to arm Syria's rebels, she said, 'left a big vacuum, which the [ISIS] jihadists have now filled.'

'There is no such thing' as Iran's 'right' to enrich uranium, Clinton insisted.

And Israel 'did what it had to do to respond to the rockets' lobbed in its direction by the Hamas terror network, she added. 'Israel has a right to defend itself.'

 Faced with an increasingly hawkish Hillary, Romney staked out his own political turf on Thursday in case he needs it two years from now.

And in the same breath, he managed to paint Mrs. Clinton with the same broad brush he wielded to tar the Democratic Party.

Obama and liberal voters, Romney wrote, have become so enamored with domestic spending that they're willing to sacrifice national security to sustain it.

'Politicians, and many of the people who elect them, want to keep up spending here at home,' he claimed.

'Entitlements and programs are putting pressure on the federal budget: We either cut defense, or we cut spending on ourselves. That, or raise our taxes. To date, the politicians have predictably voted to slash defense.'

Current and future U.S. leaders, he concluded, will have to 'choose whether to succumb to the easy path of continued military hollowing or to honor their constitutional pledge to protect the United States.'
