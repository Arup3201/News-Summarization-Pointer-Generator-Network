Busy city workers are to be offered £200 fertility ‘MoTs’ during their lunch breaks.

The one-hour test will assess women using a combination of advanced 3D ultrasound and blood tests, while men will be offered a detailed analysis of their semen for £90.

Up to 4,000 IVF cycles will also be offered each year by the Create Fertility centre, which opens in London later this month.

The Create Fertility centre will  aim to offer 4,000 IVF cycles each year but not conventional IVF treatment

Professor Geeta Nargund, who founded what is now Europe’s largest IVF clinic, said: ‘A woman’s fertility potential can be assessed in an hour.’

She said clients are offered advice depending on their fertility potential for their age.’

However, Professor Nargund’s clinic near St Paul’s will not offer conventional IVF where powerful drugs are used to stimulate the ovaries.

Instead the centre will offer natural-cycle IVF, in which a woman’s egg is collected following her natural cycle and replaced in the uterus after fertilisation.

The clinic will also offer mild-stimulation IVF, in which a lower dosage of drugs is used. 

Professor Nargund added: ‘Our primary ethos is to avoid invasive techniques and improve conditions for conception before using drugs.’

She said the treatment is safer, less expensive and is able to be repeated over subsequent cycles. Her business offers three cycles of natural-cycle IVF for £5,900, while three cycles of mild-stimulation IVF costs £6,950. 

At the centre, three cycles of natural-cycle IVF costs £5,900 and three cycles of mild-stimulation IVF will set you back £6,950

However Gedis Grudzinskas, an independent consultant gynaecologist, warned potential patients about success rates. He said: ‘While offering alternatives to conventional IVF is very positive, patients need to be aware of the success rates. Satisfying results are much lower in natural cycles than when drugs are used.’

He added: ‘The live-birth rate for natural IVF is unlikely to be more than 10 per cent, especially in older women.’

But Professor Nargund said the latest results from Create Fertility show a 27 per cent live-birth rate for women under 37 who were using their own eggs within a Natural IVF cycles, and a 40 per cent live birth rate for those under 35 using Mild IVF. 

The arrival of the clinic comes after it emerged that Britain is to get its first NHS-funded national sperm bank in October to make it easier for lesbian couples and single women to have children. For as little as £300 – less than half the cost of a private clinic – they will be able to search an online database for an anonymous donor based on their physical characteristics, profession and even hobbies.
