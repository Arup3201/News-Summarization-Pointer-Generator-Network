Manchester City have snapped up a key member of the staff brought into Manchester United by David Moyes.

James Smith was Everton’s head of technical scouting from 2003 under Moyes, who lured him in January to oversee a revamping of United’s scouting system.

But Smith was a casualty of Moyes’ sacking in April and City officials moved swiftly to recruit him, appointing him their European scout. He was spotted working for City at Liverpool’s 4-0 friendly victory over Borussia Dortmund at Anfield on Sunday.
