Khamis benefited from a special relationship with British delegates

Whilst the ongoing conflict in Libyan continues in a bid to reclaim the entire North African country from ousted Moammar Gaddafi, new evidence has been uncovered detailing the special 'privileges' Britain bestowed on the former leader's deceased son Captain Khamis al Qadhafi.

In documents uncovered by the Sunday Telegraph, the clear courting of Khamis includes SAS training for his regiment, courses at Sandhurst and taxpayer-funded invitations to British events including accommodation in five-star London hotels.

Khamis was Gaddafi's fifth son, who having graduated from the Libyan Military Academy in 2002, then spent an additional year in Russia at the Frunze Military Academy.

Having returned to his homeland, he established the 32nd Brigade, that were given an insight into British operations when 50 Libyans including members of Khamis' squad were given SAS training in counter-terrorism, weapons and field craft.

This knowledge was later used by the Brigade to a devastating effect during their retaliation for the uprising against his father.

When the conflict reached Tripoli in August, Khamis' Brigade clashed with rebel forces and carried out a brutal execution of a reported 45 prisioners at a warehouse.

Escapee, Abdulrahim Ibrahim Bashir told of the horror. He said: 'Four soldiers climbed on the top of the warehouse, and another soldier opened the door. They started shooting at us

'The guy at the door was throwing in grenades. After I escaped, I saw one of the soldiers finish off anyone who was wounded.'

It was widely accepted that Gaddafi's 
10,000 unit was better equipped than the country's army but their 
overriding responsibility was for the safety and welfare of the entire 
family.

Following the completion of the deal in principle to release the Lockerbie bomber, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, Khamis' unit signed a Â£85 million agreement with General Dynamics UK in 2007.

This provided the Libyans with a similar command and control system to that used by the British Army.

And with the relationship blossoming, clearance in 2009 allowed for 50 Libyan troops from the Brigade to undergo SAS training.

Documents dating back to 2008, 
addressed, 'Restricted - UK/Libya Eyes only,' reveal that whilst the SAS
course was 'regrettably' inaccessible for foreign parties, just months 
later, the permission to educate Khamis' men was given.

Former commanding officer to Tony 
Blair, Robin Searby, defended the education received by the Brigade 
insisting: 'There was no need for the British Government not to be 
involved with Libya at the time, as it was felt that it was better to 
have them inside the tent rather than outside.'

In letters from Khamis' elder brother
Saif, enquiring into the training, it reveals the difficult 'selection'
course endured by the Libyans during their stay at the training base.

Searby reinforced this belief by adding that the soliders 'were no up to it' following their special programme.

However relations between both British 
and Libyan parties began to deteriorate following a request from the 
Campaign Against Arms Trade to name all the overseas delegates, which 
was rejected by Libyan officials.

A letter sent by Defence and Security
representative, Graham Innett pleaded with the Libyans for reasons 
behind their denial of the names.

He
wrote: 'If you are not content, I would ask that you provide me with a 
formal statement with the reasons, as this will help strengthen the case
against release.'

Khamis and his aides believed the release would severely threaten his ability to conduct future deals as the conflict in the Arab country spiralled.

Having fled Tripoli, he is alleged to have been killed during a rebel ambush south of the capital.

However, the same British troops that once assisted him and his fellow compatriots were now fighting against him in a bid to end his father's last remaining foothold on the Arab nation.
