A man sparked fears of a domestic terrorism incident after he deliberately crashed his truck through the gates of a Coast Guard Station in Michigan, assaulted a guard and made a bomb threat, police say.

The incident unfolded at 6am on Sunday in Grand Haven where reports emerged that a man had assaulted Coast Guard personnel and made a threat that he had an explosive device in his truck.

But after state police bomb technicians checked the 34-year-old suspect's vehicle, they reported that they had not found any explosive devices in his Dodge Ram pickup truck.

According to Grand Haven police, the Michigan man broke into the station building where he assaulted Coast Guard personnel before they subdued him until police arrived and arrested him. 

The victim suffered minor injuries and is expected to recover.

Grand Haven Public Safety Director Jeff Hawke said prior to the crash, the suspect had called the Ottawa County Sheriff's Office and said he was 'going to blow up the Grand Haven station.'

This led them to investigate the incident as an 'act of domestic terrorism' because it was an attack on a federal building, Fox 17 reported.

Local residents were asked to avoid the area of Harbor Drive and the boardwalk which were both closed until about 12:30 Sunday afternoon.

A shelter was also put in place for residents at a nearby condo building while police examined the bomb threat.

But all local buildings have since been given the all clear and the police confirm that the incident is not linked to terrorism or any 'terrorist acts.'

'No explosive device was located and the Coast Guard station building has been deemed safe,' Hawke said.

It is not yet known what the attacker's motives were. 

The Grand Haven Department of Public Safety is being assisted by the Ottawa County Sheriff's Department, Michigan State Police, U.S. Coast Guard and the Federal Bureau of Alcohol/Tobacco/Firearms.
