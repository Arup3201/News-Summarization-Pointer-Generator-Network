American Rickie Fowler looked forward to playing alongside Rory McIlroy in the first two rounds of the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship here this week and confidently predicted: ’We’re going to have some fun and plenty of heated battles in the years to come.’

They made a good start on that front last year, when the Northern Irishman pipped the colourful Californian to both the Open and the USPGA Championship, before wiping the floor with him in a singles match at the Ryder Cup.

Yet the gritty Fowler is far from daunted, and believes he will win plenty of such tussles himself in the future.

‘He may have had some better ball-striking than me at times last year but I don’t feel like my game is any weaker than his or anything like that,’ said the 25 year old. ‘I’ve come out on top a couple of times against him and he just happened to come out on top a few more times than me last season.’

Fowler burst back into the limelight last year after a couple of disappointing campaigns. He first hit the headlines when he defeated McIlroy in a sudden death play-off to win the 2012 Wells Fargo Championship and a long rivalry between the pair was predicted, only for Fowler to fall off the charts.

Armed with a swing rebuilt by Butch Harmon, that all changed last year as Fowler finished in the top five in all four majors – the only man ever to achieve such a feat without winning one. Now he wants to make that final step and win one - and knows he is going to have to get past McIlroy to achieve it.

‘To me it feels like we’re really just at the start and we’re going to be meeting up an awful lot over the rest of our careers. We know how tough he is to beat, and particularly if he is driving the ball like he did through the summer last year. Make no mistake, he is a great player. But I am confident I can win my share.’

Fowler and McIlroy both come from similar backgrounds, so it is perhaps not surprising that this is a rivalry of the most friendly kind. 

Both had parents who did extra jobs to give their offspring a chance. Both were obsessed by golf from an early age. 

The mutual respect that they have was underlined when McIlroy took over as tournament host for the Irish Open at Royal County Down in May and Fowler pledged to come over and support the event.

This will be Fowler’s first appearance in the Middle East but it will not be his last. 

Indeed, he is so enamoured about playing golf outside the United States that he is giving serious consideration to taking out membership of the European Tour, as well as the PGA Tour. 

‘It is definitely something to look at,’ he confirmed. 

As well as here and the Irish, Fowler is also likely to play the Scottish Open. Add in the majors and the WGCs, and he would only have to add one more event - the DP World Tour Championship, for example - to become a member.

As for the Ryder Cup, Fowler is part of the 11 man Task Force charged with trying to get to the bottom of why America always loses. 

‘We’ve had just one meeting so far but I think getting all of us together and more involved will help us going forward,’ he said. ‘We need to reach the point in two years where we’re able to put up a better fight and get that Ryder Cup back on our home soil.’
