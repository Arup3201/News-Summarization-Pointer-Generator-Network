'It's my right to display this doll if I want to': Richard 
Foster, 34, who was threatened with arrest in Bognor Regis for having a blow up
doll in the back of his van

The driver of a replica Only Fools and Horses van was pulled over by police and threatened with arrest - for having a comedy blow-up doll in the back.

Police in Bognor Regis, Sussex, told Richard Foster, 34, to remove the ‘offensive’ blonde doll visible in his Trotters Independent Trading Company van’s rear window.

An officer told him the doll could cause ‘alarm or distress’ and threatened him with arrest if he didn’t do as he was told.

In a classic episode of the hit comedy, wheeler dealer Del Boy and Rodney try to shift some latex sex dolls - but one inflates in the back of the yellow van.

Mr Foster, who hires out a replica of the iconic three-wheel Reliant Regal that features in the series, was outraged by the claims and at first refused.

But he was on his way to pick up a groom and best man for a wedding and had to give in or risk ruining the happy couple’s day if he was locked up.

Mr Foster, from Bognor Regis, Sussex, said: 'When I first saw the police car’s blue lights flashing in my rear view mirror, I thought there must be an emergency.

'I pulled over on the road to let the police pass as I didn’t want to hold them up, and couldn’t believe it when they pulled in behind me.

'I have never had any problems or been stopped in the van before - normally police officers wave as they go past.

'The policeman got out of the car and told me to take the blow-up doll out of the window, otherwise I would be arrested.

'He said I was committing a Section 5 public order offence because the doll could cause alarm or distress.

'Here I was, dressed in a suit and tie at 11.15am on my way to chauffeur a groom and best man to a wedding.

'The doll is entirely non-sexual and has no sexual parts - she’s a comedy doll.

'The policeman didn’t care that I was going to be late, he told me to take the doll down or I would be arrested.

'I replied that people on stag and hen dos walk around in town with sex dolls all the time - are you going to arrest them?'

Mr Foster continued: 'I can’t believe 
anyone is going to be alarmed by this doll. The police should be putting
public money into fighting real crime.

'I think this is an example of the sad world we live in. The world has gone mad.

'In
the end I had to say I would take the doll down because otherwise I 
would have been locked up in a cell and ruined someone’s wedding.

'But if I hadn’t been going to a wedding, I would have stood my ground. It’s my right to display this doll if I want.'

Mr Foster, who also works as a flying instructor, has complained to Sussex Police about the incident on Saturday.

A police inspector told him he would be speaking to the officer involved, Mr Foster said.

Taking liberties: Mr Foster was ordered to take 
down the doll as it could cause 'alarm or distress' and threatened with 
arrest if he didn't. He indignantly relented because he was on the way 
to a crucial wedding job

'Outrageous': Mr Foster, who also works as a 
flying instructor, has complained to Sussex Police about the incident on
Saturday. He says a police inspector told him he would be speaking to 
the officer involved

Mr Foster has owned the van for a year and recently drove it for a female traffic police officer’s wedding.

He added: 'The policeman even told me if he saw me with the doll again I would be arrested.

'Everything about my van is a joke - it’s a comedy van from a national treasure comedy show loved by millions.

'The van has a suitcase on the roof, red furry dice hanging from the rear view mirror and the policeman went for me over a blow-up doll.

'Every single person I have told about this thinks it’s outrageous and a waste of police time and resources.

'It makes a mockery of law and order in this country.

'I cannot believe that while we’re in a recession, with the country on its knees, the police are pulling a man trying to make a living over.

'The British are renowned for their humour and I’m astounded that we seem to have lost it. If you can’t have a laugh, what can you do?'
