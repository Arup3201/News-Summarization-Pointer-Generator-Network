Eight people have been injured after a stray firework fell into a crowd during a Christmas lights switch on by Eastenders actor Steve McFadden.

Mr McFadden, who plays Phil Mitchell in the soap, turned up to switch on the festive illuminations in Salisbury in Wiltshire.

The fireworks, which cost £4,000, were fired from the roof of the city's Guildhall to mark the end of the event, which was attended by up to 14,000 people.

Paramedics treated eight people in Salisbury city centre after a stray firework fell into a crowd during a Christmas lights switch on 

The fireworks, costing £4,000, were set off from the city's Guildhall, pictured, to mark the end of the ceremony

Just before the stray firework hit the crowd Eastenders actor Steve McFadden, who plays Phil Mitchell in the soap had turned on the city's Christmas lights

The fireworks were to mark the end of the event attended by Mr McFadden, pictured, which has attracted around 14,000 people 

However, one firework malfunctioned causing debris to fall to the ground in Queen Street and New Canal, where the crowds had gathered.

Eight people had to be seen by paramedics, with five treated for minor injuries at the scene, and one woman taken to hospital as a 'precaution', after she was bumped on the head.  

An eight-year-old girl also suffered a 4cm facial burn in the incident.

One of the victims, Brett Bowles, told the BBC he was hit by pieces of firework at the beginning of the display.

He said: 'I had my daughter in my arms watching the fireworks.

'The first few had gone over and then suddenly it felt like someone had thrown a bottle, which hit me in the side of the head.

As the stray fireworks began to fall among the crowd, safety stewards moved people back to a safe distance 

Salisbury City Council say the fireworks had been provided by a professional firm and had been due to last between six and eight minutes 

'Then I looked down on the floor and there were some old firework remains there and the blood just pouring from my head.'

Fellow spectator Hannah Austin claimed she avoided more than one falling fireworks at the festive ceremony.

She said: 'It wasn't just one stray firework, I was in the ‘backstage’ area directly in front of the Guildhall and avoided about seven coming straight down towards me.

'Luckily only one hit the audience, although this should not have happened either.

'There were cardboard tubes everywhere after the event.'

But the malfunctioning firework fell to the ground in between Queen Street and New Canal, causing debris to fall 

The stray firework bumped one woman on the head and she was taken to hospital as a precaution. An eight-year-old girl also suffered a 4cm facial burn 

A spokeswoman for Salisbury City Council said that the display had been provided by a professional firm and had been due to last for between six and eight minutes.

She explained: 'Salisbury City Council are today beginning to conduct a full investigation into an incident that occurred at the Salisbury Christmas lights switch on event on Thursday 20 November.

'During the firework part of the event, at approximately 7.05pm, it would appear that a firework malfunctioned.

One of the victims who was struck by the fireworks likened the blow to his head as being struck by a bottle 

Salisbury City Council has been running the Christmas lights switch on event, which featured the fireworks since 2009 

'This resulted in debris falling to the ground in Queen Street and New Canal. St John Ambulance, who were present throughout the event, saw eight people.

'One person was taken to hospital as a precautionary measure.

'The council apologise for any distress this incident caused and are currently carrying out a full investigation with all involved.

'The Christmas light switch on was a really good event until that moment and everyone was having a fabulous time.

'We don’t think we've ever seen the square so packed.'  

Security staff quickly moved revellers away from the affected area into a clearance zone, she added.

Salisbury City Council has been running the event since 2009.
