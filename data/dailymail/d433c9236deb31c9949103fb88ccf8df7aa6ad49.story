A feminist speaker has canceled a speech at Utah State University after learning the school would allow concealed firearms despite an anonymous threat against her.

Anita Sarkeesian was scheduled to give a presentation on the portrayal of women in video games on Wednesday evening. She made the decision to cancel on Tuesday night.

University staff members had received a threat earlier on Tuesday from an unknown person who vowed to carry out a mass shooting if the event was held. 

Anita Sarkeesian has canceled her scheduled speech at Utah State University on Wednesday after learning the school would allow concealed firearms despite an anonymous threat against her

University spokesman Tim Vitale says the FBI told school officials the threat is consistent with ones Sarkeesian receives when she gives speeches elsewhere.

The university consulted with federal and state law enforcement and had determined it was safe to go ahead with the presentation.

But Sarkeesian pulled out after learning from university officials that concealed weapons would be permitted, as long as attendees have a valid concealed firearm permit in accordance with Utah law.

In an email received by a number of staff, the unknown person promised 'the deadliest school shooting in American history', and declared that he was inspired by an infamous Canadian anti-feminist shooting in 1989. 

Sarkeesian tweeted about the incident and made it quite clear that she blamed the police for refusing to take steps to prevent concealed firearms at the event

Sarkeesian is the creator of Feminist Frequency, a video webseries that explores representations of women in pop culture (above a still from Final Fantasy VII)

Marc Lepine separated out and killed 14 women at the École Polytechnique de Montréal, before committing suicide. His suicide note stated 'I have decided to send the feminists, who have always ruined my life, to their Maker.'

Sarkeesian is a media critic and the creator of Feminist Frequency, a video webseries that explores the representations of women in pop culture narratives.
