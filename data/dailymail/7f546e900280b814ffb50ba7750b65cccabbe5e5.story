Gerald Herbert Childs, 33, has been arrested booked on multiple counts of attempted kidnapping and molesting child charges

An 11-year-old was celebrating her birthday when a man, 33, grabbed her by the arm in Stockton, California and attempted to kidnap her along with another 8-year-old girl.

Esmeralda, 11, was able to break free from Gerald Herbert Childs', 33, grip and the girls' ruffled parents bravely cornered him into a nearby restaurant where he was later arrested.

Childs tried to grab both Esmeralda and an 8-year-old girl at an apartment complex at the 4300 block of North Pershing avenue but luckily he was stopped from running off with the girls. 'I was outside and he grabbed me,' Esmeralda told Recordnet.com.

'I was feeling really scared that something bad was going to happen to me.'

Esmeralda's father, Rene Castillo and the 8-year-old's mother Pauline Melton held Childs at L & L Hawaiian Barbeque restaurant at 4555 N. Pershing Ave. until police arrived to take him into custody.

Childs was arrested and booked on multiple counts of attempted kidnapping and molesting child charges.

Melton told reporters that she sensed something strange when she noticed Childs following her from a corner store to the apartment complex.

He initially grabbed Melton's daughter but he let her go to lunge after Esmeralda.

Esmeralda's father dove towards the man who even tried to enter his home to grab his daughter.

He was going to harm her,' Castillo, 33, said in Spanish to Recordnet.com.

Now both Esmeralda and the 8-year-old girl are traumatized and are afraid of what might happen to them if there parents are not nearby.

'I kind of don't want to be outside alone when nobody is out there,' said Esmeralda.

'It took her a while to go to sleep last night and she fell asleep with me,' Melton said of her frightened 8-year-old daughter.

'We're locked down (in gated apartments) and everything, but we're all paranoid now,' she added.

Stockton police spokesman Officer Joe Silva told reporters that the girls did the right thing by trying to get away from the kidnapper and by alerting an adult.

'We don't investigate these types of cases too often,' said Silva. 'These little girls were lucky.'

'We're very appreciative of the father and the other adult family members for detaining the suspect. Even though this is a pretty terrible situation, they probably prevented a worse situation from occurring, because who knows who else the suspect would have attacked,' Silva added.

Childs will be arraigned in a courtroom on Tuesday. He is currently being held at the San Joaquin County Jail.
