A magistrate who has handed down many tough sentences over the past decade for reckless driving and speeding has now lost his licence for doing the same thing.

Magistrate Ronald Saines, from Geelong in Victoria, was clocked doing 25km/h over the speed limit last November while apparently trying to overtake five cars.

Unfortunately for Saines, one of these cars was an unmarked police vehicle.

The senior magistrate - who is known for berating dangerous drivers who have appeared before him - had his licence immediately suspended for 28 days, the Herald Sun reported.

A source told the newspaper Mr Saines was attempting to overtake a number of cars on the highway when he was stopped by police who issue him an infringement notice for driving between 25km/h and 34km/h over the limit.

Mr Saines had to report to Chief Magistrate Peter Lauritsen following the incident, who said in a statement his actions didn't change his ability as a magistrate.

'I have discussed the circumstances surrounding the suspension of his licence.' he told the Herald Sun.

'I am satisfied he has performed, and will continue to perform, his duties as a magistrate properly.'

It was reported that Mr Saines enlisted the services of a court employee to help him get to work during his suspension period - which was carried out in December.

Since 2002, when Mr Saines became a magistrate, he has been known for his delivery severe messages to those in similar situations to the one he found himself in.

To one offender caught travelling at 139km/h in a 110km/h zone, he said: 'When you eventually do get your licence back, you will have to start over with a completely different attitude to driving.'

To another who had had their licence 'less than 12 months' he warned how close to losing control or causing a serious accident they had been.

However Mr Saines is said to have let off a man travelling at least 35km/h over the speed limit off in 2006, after he ruled that speedometer could have been faulty. 

Mr Saines has also sat in on the judgment of Geelong footballer Mathew Stokes, who fronted court on drug charges in 2010.
