Simple lifestyle changes could see 80,000 people saved from dementia every year, a major research project has found.

The study suggests that people make changes earlier in life to cut the risk of developing the brain disease as they grow old.

It says three million cases of dementia could be avoided in Britain by 2040 if people started regularly exercising their bodies and minds. 

A major research study has found that exercising the mind - by completing puzzles or playing chess - as well as the body can cut the risk of developing dementia

The results of the study - which looked at the benefits in 1,200 men and women in their 60s and 70s - are due to be formally presented at the World Innovation Summit for Health in Doha in February. 

Its chairman, surgeon and former Labour health minister Lord Darzi said people should act quickly to change their diet and exercise and stimulate their brains through puzzles.

He said this could help to prevent a ‘tide of suffering’ which could overwhelm the country, which already has an estimated 800,000 dementia sufferers – half of which are undiagnosed. 

Writing in the Daily Telegraph, he said individuals should adopt a ‘use it or lose it’ attitude to their brains.

He wrote: 'The degenerative brain condition that strips sufferers of their dignity and humanity is among the most feared of all those that afflict our species.

'It is one of the greatest health challenges we face.'

The surgeon warned the public should not wait for a cure to be found, adding: ‘At an individual level we need to look after our brains – sharpen those chess skills, pick up that crossword and solve that puzzle.’

And he said there was evidence mental decline may start in the late 40s. He said: ‘Eating a healthy diet, avoiding obesity and getting plenty of exercise are all important to brain health because what is good for our hearts is also good for our heads.’ 

The study saw half of the 1,200 men and women make changes to their diet and embark on brain training. Their hearts were also managed and they increased social activity.

The report suggests many cases might be avoided if action was taken to reduce blood pressure - it said untreated blood pressure in mid-life could give a person a 60 per cent higher chance of developing dementia. Type 2 diabetes linked to weight gain was also said to be a key cause.

It also suggests 13,000 cases a year are linked with depression, 4,000 to obesity and inactivity, and 2,000 to smoking.

But the report warns: 'There is no known intervention that can definitively prevent dementing diseases.'

Yet Lord Darzi said the results marked a 'significant breakthrough' in showing that individuals could curb the effects of dementia.  

The study - which looked at the benefits in 1,200 men and women in their 60s and 70s - also found that getting plenty of exercise is important for brain health

1 Regular exercise

Doing exercise three to five times a week for between 30 minutes and an hour is recommended. In the UK, adults are urged to do 150 minutes of activity a week to promote health but barely a third manage it. 

2 Give up smoking

Never smoking is recommended, but smokers who give up by the age of 40 can gain ten years of extra life, claim scientists.

3 Reach a healthy body weight

A healthy weight is a ‘healthy’ body mass index (BMI) score. BMI is assessed by comparing height to weight, in a calculation which divides weight in kilos by height in metres squared. A healthy score is between 18.5 and 24.99 - above is overweight and obese. 

4 Eat a Mediterranean diet

The Mediterranean diet is high in fish, nuts, whole grains and ‘healthy’ fats such as those in olive oil, while low in red meat and dairy products. Studies suggest three to five or more portions of fruit and vegetables with fat making up less than 30 per cent of calories. 

5 Keep alcohol consumption low

Low or moderate alcohol consumption is classified as three or fewer units per day for men, two or fewer for women, with abstinence not treated as a healthy behaviour. A small 125ml glass of wine contains 1.3 units, while a pint of beer contains at least two units.
