Ian Watkins’ former lover claims she gave police photographic evidence of the singer abusing children four years before he was arrested.

Police were allegedly shown a picture by Joanne Mjadzelics which Watkins took of a four-year-old girl holding up a picture frame with cocaine and a razor-blade on it in 2008.

The image, which cannot be published for legal reasons, shows the little girl is holding a rolled-up £20 note in her hand, according to BBC Wales's Week In Week Out programme.

Claims: Watkins' former lover Joanne Mjadzelics, left, says she showed a potentially incriminating photograph to police years before the rock star (right) was arrested

The Lostprophets singer was jailed 
for 29 years in December after admitting a string of child sex offences.
 He was arrested in 2012, but his former lover has claimed she had 
warned of his depraved crimes years before, and gave evidence to police.

The girl's father also raised concerns with police, but says he was told to drop his claims to protect the singer's pop career.

The man said investigators in South Wales Police told him 'not to pursue it any more because it could ruin Ian's career'.

Miss
 Mjadzelics says that Watkins told her the powder was cocaine, and that 
from December 2008 she complained to police and social services in turn 
in an attempt to protect the girl.

She
 said: 'It was repeated calls about the same little girl. Every time I 
knew that my complaints weren’t going anywhere with the police I would 
back it up by going to social services and saying “can’t you do anything
 about this?"'

In light of evidence about the persistent complaints, the former chairman of the British Association of Social Services says an inquiry must be launched to find all the details of how the case was handled.

Child protection expert David Niven said: 'Some kind of large 
inquiry really needs to happen that will be transparent and be educative
 for the rest of professionals up and down Wales and England.'

The
 Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is already investigating a detective 
sergeant from South Wales Police for gross misconduct, as well as the 
way he was managed.

South Wales Police have yet to clarify what, if any, action was taken as a result of Miss Mjadzelics's complaints.

During her interview with the BBC, Miss Mjadzelics recounted shocking conversations with Watkins in which he boasted of his plans to rape a two-year-old child.

Recalling an exchange after he had been released once on bail, she says he told her 'I've got a two-year-old on Tuesday'.

When asked what he meant, she says he continued 'I’ve got a two-year-old to rape on Tuesday.'

Claiming to be 'a big deal', Watkins allegedly told her of how he would use the children of 'superfans' to fulfill his depraved fantasies.

According to Miss Mjadzelic, he said: 'I’ve got all these superfans and they’re giving me their kids.’

Miss Mjadzelic also recalled how Watkins showed her a video of a child being raped 'because he wanted a reaction', and also how he told her about plans to drug and rape the child of one of his fans.

The fan, later known as Woman B, was later jailed alongside Watkins for child sex offences.

She said she was told about Watkins' intentions towards her young son.

She said: 'He’s told me that he wants to put GHB in his sippy cup and on his dummy and rape him.’

She said she went to the police again, this time in Doncaster, but was ignored. She said: 'I’m telling them [police officers] he’s going to rape a baby a month before he does.’

The police force said today that they
 have 'improved and strengthened strengthened' the ways in which they 
handle child abuse complaints in light of the case.

Rhondda
 Cynon Taff Council social services said they 'took action in line with 
agreed procedures' and refused to comment further on claims the were 
contacted repeatedly.

The IPCC's report into the case is not expected to be published for several months.
