She made the life-changing decision to defect from the BBC to ITV earlier this year, to front new daytime show Good Morning Britain.

But as Susanna Reid, 43, made her debut on the fledgling programme on Monday morning, viewers were quick to point out that the presenter's best assets were not being utilised by the show's bosses.

Shortly after the programme premiered at 6am, Twitter was awash with comments from critics who complained that Susanna's trim legs were being hidden because she spent the majority of the time sitting behind a desk with her co-hosts.

'It's like buying a Ferrari and keeping it in the garage!' Good Morning Britain viewers were quick to complain that Susanna Reid's legs couldn't be seen behind the desk as the show premiered on Monday morning

Complaints: Viewers didn't hold back with their criticism of the format

Do you think Good Morning Britain is better than Daybreak?

One viewer commented: 'Why has ITV paid so much for @susannareid100 only to put her behind a desk? Its like buying a Ferrari and keeping it in the garage #gmb.'

In fact, it was reported recently that Susanna is earning a staggering £400,000 for her new role on Good Morning Britain, which sees her host alongside Ben 
Shephard, 39, Charlotte Hawkins, 28 and Sean Fletcher, 30.

But the overwhelming opinion of viewers seemed to be that the desk was ruining their view, with another writing: 'You don't hire Susanna Reid and then stick her behind a desk #getyourpinsout #GoodMorningBritain.'

New format: Another sticking point for viewers was that the show is largely too Americanised in its format

Line-up: The four presenters kicked off the show from behind the desk, before moving around the studio later in the programme

Spot the difference: The studio and the layout is incredibly similar to that of Good Morning America

Other comments included: 'How to loose viewers from the off put @susannareid100 behind a desk. She was popular for a reason. #GoodMorningBritain.'

Another read: 'ITV's
 new breakfast show has no chance! Sticking Susanna Reid behind a desk 
ruins her appeal to half the viewership, lol! Epic fail ITV!'

Later on the show, however, Susanna moved from behind the desk, giving viewers the chance to catch a glimpse of her enviable pins.

The big reveal: Susanna later moved and showed off her legs in her knee-length dress

Much better! Susanna later got her legs out as she and Ben interviewed Paul O'Grady

Speaking recently about the now infamous desk, and the new set of the show, Susanna said: 'Our set 
is different, fresh and it's not what people have been used to over the 
last couple of years in breakfast television.

'It is something new and exciting for us. We all start behind the desk, which hasn't happened for a while.'

The lack of legs on show wasn't the only thing viewers complained about, as many argued that the new format was more American in style - similar to Stateside shows such as Good Morning America.

One viewer commented: 'Good morning Britain is too formal and newsy and like an American morning show. #GMB.'

While another added: 'Well, Good Morning
 Britain looks very American so far...suited team behind desks, tickers,
 huge pic takes up half screen.'

However, not all reactions to the show were negative, as one viewer wrote: 'Totally loving #GMB #GoodMorningBritain.'

New faces: Susanna and Ben are the main two hosts of the show

Completing the crew: Charlotte Hawkins, 28 and Sean Fletcher, 30, complete the quartet

And another commented on the amount of 
attractive female presenters on the show, tweeting: '#GoodMorningBritain
 Susanna Reid, Charlotte Hawkins & Laura Tobin on the same channel! 
I'm in heaven!'

Even Sky News presenter Kay Burley commented on the format, admitting the hectic atmosphere of the show was too much for her to handle.

She tweeted: 'Just watching Good Morning Britain ... there's so much going on I need a little lie down.'

Starting out: The set looked vastly different and much more sombre when Adrian Chiles and Christine Bleakley hosted it

The Radio Times commented
 that Susanna had appeared nervous for the first part of the show, 
before getting into her stride as the programme progressed.

Paul Jones commented: 'In
 her central role behind the desk, Susanna initially seems the most 
nervous of the foursome – “somebody’s put some extra words in my head… 
look at me all discombobulated” – quite possibly because she knows all 
eyes are on her as ITV’s marquee signing.'

Jones
 also commented on the American feel of the programme, with 'the screen 
seeming very cluttered with garish idents and info graphics'.

It was confirmed over the weekend that after a two-week settling in period, Susanna will only work from Mondays to Thursdays, with ex Daybreak star Ranvir Singh standing in for her on Fridays.

Early arrival: Susanna was without make-up as she arrived for her first day on the show clutching her laptop and the day's papers

Kicking things off: Susanna is reportedly being paid a staggering £400,000 for her role on the show

Sitting pretty: Susanna's previous role at BBC Breakfast saw her put on a much more leggy display
