For those who expected Louis van Gaal to blow into English football like a whirlwind, the man they call the Iron Tulip made a surprisingly quiet start to life as Manchester United’s new manager.

There was no rousing speech to his players at the club’s Carrington training complex yesterday, no  laying down of the law, just polite introductions at lunchtime and a watching brief over his first  training session on Wednesday night.

New beginning: New Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal meets Ryan Giggs and Edward Woodward

Time to work: The trio have a big job on their hands if they are going to make United competitive again

Fifty-eight days after he was 
officially confirmed as manager in May, Van Gaal finally touched down in
 Manchester at 11.50am aboard a private jet charged with putting United 
back on their perch, to use Sir Alex Ferguson’s terminology.

That
 the 62-year-old turned up for work just three days after returning from
 the World Cup in Brazil with Holland says everything about his 
determination to drag United from the mire of the post-Ferguson era.

Some
 might question his choice of attire — a blue suit and sky blue and 
white striped tie — given the contrasting fortunes at neighbours 
Manchester City, but this is not a manager who cares about conforming.

Half
 an hour after he was driven from the airport in a club car, Van Gaal 
arrived at Carrington for the first time to be met by No 2  Ryan Giggs 
and club executive  vice-chairman Ed Woodward.

He
 was shown to his office and then given a tour of the complex by Giggs, 
who has been running things in Van Gaal’s absence along with Dutch 
coaches Marcel Bout and Albert Stuivenberg.

They
 will update Van Gaal on every member of his squad before United leave 
for their pre-season tour of America at lunchtime on Friday.

Van
 Gaal joined the players at 1pm in the Carrington dining room where 
chicken and duck were on the menu. The manager introduced himself to 
each one individually and spoke with them for a couple of minutes before
 sitting at a  separate table with his Dutch backroom team and Giggs.

The
 squad had already trained in the morning and been told to report for a 
second workout at 5.30pm — their fourth double session in 10 days since 
returning for pre-season work.

Good omen: Van Gaal has had a successful summer with Holland at the 2014 World Cup

Van
 Gaal had been expected to speak to them and outline his vision for the 
club, but instead he stood back and observed while Stuivenberg and Bout 
took the session.

It is 
understood that Van Gaal will wait until more of the club’s World Cup 
contingent, including England internationals Wayne Rooney, Danny 
Welbeck, Phil Jones and Chris Smalling, join up with the squad on Friday
 before addressing the players.

They
 have been given Thursday off to spend with their families while Van 
Gaal faces his first official news conference at Old Trafford at 3pm. 
Despite the softly-softly start, one thing is clear — Van Gaal’s word 
will be law.

‘He’s got his 
own management style which has thrown up a few difficulties along the 
way wherever he’s been because of the way that he is, the way he puts 
himself in front of players,’ said fellow  Dutchman and former United 
first-team coach Rene Meulensteen on Wednesday.

‘Players accept it or players sometimes don’t. If they don’t accept it then, yeah, you probably have a problem.’

Van
 Gaal’s arrival in Manchester coincided with an announcement that United
 have tied up a long-term sponsorship deal with a Japanese noodle 
company. Even for a coach whose vast experience takes in Barcelona, 
Bayern Munich and Ajax, the next chapter of his distinguished career 
promises to be something else altogether.

A fortnight before the World Cup, Van Gaal took the stage in his native Holland, addressing an audience of business experts to outline his leadership vision. Van Gaal on arrogance:

The national coach sees opportunities because he believes in vision and  structure. When I say that, I mean my vision and my structure. Yes, that is arrogant. I bet you hear that people find me arrogant. It does not bother me. I am not arrogant but I do believe in my vision, so the people who work in my organisation have something to hold on to. That is what I believe in.Van Gaal on preparation:

I see chances because I believe in preparation. That is half the job. My mum used to say that and she only went to primary school. You don’t think I would be standing here without preparing? Training. You recruit people and do you train them to create the best product? I do.Van Gaal on backroom staff:

I can’t do it on my own because I don’t know everything, do I? I know you start laughing because I am portrayed that I do know everything. I listen to the specialists. When I became national coach, the whole world thought I was going to pick the players to get us to the World Cup. No! First the staff! We have to surround players with quality.Van Gaal on being the boss:Vision is not just about the game. My vision also stands for my vision on each person, on society, on the way I speak. My tone of voice —  if I leave gaps between my sentences there is always a reason. It always comes back to my football team. Van Gaal on the Spain model:When I saw the Holland squad for the first time, I showed them Barcelona, who play with the triangle midfield with the point directing to the defence — one controlling midfielder. But I also showed the players the Spain team. Otherwise they would say: ‘Yes boss, but how can we adapt when we only meet up eight times a season?’ The boys knew from day one what the vision of Van Gaal stood for.
