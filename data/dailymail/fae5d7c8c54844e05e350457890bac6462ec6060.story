There's not much that TV stylist Gok Wan doesn't know about dressing curves and now the fashion designer has unveiled his latest collection of controlwear for plus-size fashion brand Simply Be.

His hit 'Banger Booster' bra - famous for creating eye-popping cleavage for bigger breasts - is back in new colour ways for the new season, and with it come a bevvy of other curve-controlling pieces designed to smooth lumps and bumps for women battling with any bulges.

The hardworking eparates include a Body Shaper, Balconette Bra, Waist Slip 
and High Waist Brief, Sassy Slip, Pull Me In Pants, 
Divine Outline, Clicker Knicker and Curve Controller and have been created in a fashionable houndstooth print.

Gok Wan has designed another shapewear range for plus-size clothing brand Simply Be

The autumn/winter 2013 range comes in cup sizes B-G and back sizes 32-46 as well as dress size 12-32

Gok said:  'I've designed this collection to 
accentuate the best parts of any girl's body and keep her legs, tum, 
boobs and bum looking their best.

'It's all about getting it on and feeling sexy in seconds. All my 
favourites are in this collection, from the Slicker Knicker to the 
Sassy Slip - if you've got it, I say definitely flaunt it girls.'

And the fashionista - who shot to 
fame as presenter and stylist of TV style show How To Look Good Naked - 
doesn't just have his eye on your underwear drawer, his latest supermarket fashion collection hits Sainsbury's stores next week.
