England breathed a sigh of relief after it emerged that Chris Robshaw’s shoulder injury will keep him out for only ‘three to four weeks’.

The England captain was ruled out of Saturday's European Rugby Champions Cup match against Leinster, raising fears he could need an operation on the shoulder which would rule him out of the Six Nations.

But a statement from Harlequins said that ‘following consultation with a specialist, the RFU and the Harlequins medical team, Robshaw is expected to return in three to four weeks’.

Robshaw, 28, will not need surgery, but he stands to miss Premiership games against Newcastle, Northampton, London Welsh and Leicester on top of the trip to Dublin.

The European Champions Cup clash with Wasps on the third weekend of January offers his most likely route back to playing, with Quins completing their European group campaign against Castres a week later.

While a bitter blow to his club, the news that Robshaw’s absence will be limited to up to a month will be welcomed by England.

The openside, who played every minute of the autumn series, will be at the helm when England open their Six Nations against Wales in Cardiff on February 6 and will almost certainly lead the assault on the 2015 World Cup.

Elsewhere, fly-half Quade Cooper has made himself available for World Cup selection after signing a contract extension with the Australian Rugby Union until the end of 2015.

The 26-year-old Queensland Red lost the Wallabies’ starting No 10 position to New South Wales Waratah Bernard Foley when sidelined with a shoulder injury but played an impact role off the bench during the season-ending tour to Europe.

Wallabies coach Michael Cheika said: ‘I’ve really enjoyed coaching Quade on tour. He’s clearly a quality player and has proven himself at state and national level for many seasons.’

A mercurial talent with 53 Test caps, Cooper has struggled to reach his once-dazzling best after suffering a serious knee injury at the 2011 World Cup in New Zealand, the country of his birth.
