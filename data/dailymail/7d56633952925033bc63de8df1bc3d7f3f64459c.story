Andy Murray has warned the Australian Open it risks damaging the reputation of tennis after players were forced to play in searing heat in Melbourne.

Canadian player Frank Dancevic and a 
ball boy both collapsed on court while China's Peng Shuai vomited then 
suffered cramp during her defeat as temperatures soared above 40C.

Czech veteran Radek Stepanek also retired with heat exhaustion against Slovenian Blaz Kavcic.

Temperatures topped out at 42.2C at 5.45pm, just after Murray began his first-round match against Japan's Go Soeda, which he went on to win 6-1 6-1 6-3.

But the pair were fortunate that Hisense Arena is one of the stadium courts, so they were at least able to play in shade.

The tournament implemented part of its extreme heat policy, with women being given a 10-minute break between the second and third sets, but they decided not to put it fully into operation, which would have seen play suspended and roofs on show courts closed.

Dancevic described the conditions as 'inhumane', adding: 'Having players with so many problems and complaining to the tournament that it's too hot to play, until somebody dies.'

Murray said: 'It's definitely 
something that you maybe have to look at a little bit. As much as it's 
easy to say the conditions are safe - a few people said there's doctors 
saying it's fine - it only takes one bad thing to happen.

'And
 it looks terrible for the whole sport when people are collapsing, ball 
kids are collapsing, people in the stands are collapsing. That's 
obviously not great.

'I 
know when I went out to hit before the match, the conditions at 2.30pm or 
3pm were very, very tough. Anyone's going to struggle in that heat.

'There's
 been some issues in other sports with players having heart attacks. I 
don't know exactly why that is. In this heat, that's when you're really 
pushing it to your limits. You don't want to see anything bad happen to 
anyone.'

Bronze bonus: The soaring temperatures seem to be doing wonders for Andy Murray's girlfriend Kim Sears (above) who showed off her tanned legs as she cheered him from the sidelines

When to stop 
matches is at the discretion of referee Wayne McKewen after a rule 
change this year, and based on readings not just of temperature but also
 humidity and wind.

Murray 
said: 'Apparently it wasn't that humid today. That's why it wasn't 
implemented. There's different rules for the men and women, I don't know
 why.

'I didn't sit down 
and discuss whether the guys are happy with the rules or not. But every 
singles person that I saw coming in from practice or going out to play a
 match or coming back from a match, everyone just said, "It's really hot
 today".'

In a statement, 
chief medical officer Tim Wood said: 'The majority of matches were 
completed without any court calls from the medical team.

'Of
 course there were a few players who experienced heat-related illness or
 discomfort, but none required significant medical intervention after 
they had completed their match.

'Generally the playing group coped 
extremely well.'

But the 
severe heat appeared to be anything but a nuisance for his 25-year-old 
girlfriend Kim Sears, who showed off her tanned legs as she cheered him 
on.

None coped better than 
Murray, who was playing only his third competitive match following back 
surgery but was detained for only an hour and 27 minutes by Soeda.

The
 world number 112 was clearly not in the Wimbledon champion's class, but
 there was no doubt the fourth seed was striking the ball extremely 
well.
