A reluctant thief, who broke down in tears while demanding the cash register from a Papa John's restaurant, was given a free meal to console himself.

The unidentified would-be robber stopped himself half-way through his raid on the pizza chain in Helena, Montana, in the early hours of Monday, the Sun Herald reports

Through his tears the man wearing a black-hooded sweatshirt with a red bandana covering his face told the cashier he had tried to steal in a bid to support his wife and child.

Pizza but no dough: A man broke down mid-way through his raid on Papa John's in Helena, Montana. The would-be robber admitted he didn't want to commit the crime on the restaurant at the Prospect Avenue shopping center, pictured

Just moments before - around midnight on Monday - the man, armed with a large knife, had entered the pizza chain on Prospect Avenue handing over a note which demanded money. 

The clerk was ready to hand over the cash when the intruder had a change of heart and started to cry.

In sympathy the cashier gave him a free pizza, wings and a soda and they talked through his problems. 

'I'd say the clerk was pretty astute,' Helena Police Chief Troy McGee told the Sun Herald. 'I mean, he knows how to talk to this person. Kind of commiserated with him a little. Talked to him about it and you know actually changed his mind about robbing the place. That was pretty good.'

Apparently while waiting for the meal the knife fell out of the intruder's pocket but he never threatened anyone with it.

He left the store quietly with his free meal in hand.

A manager at the store told the newspaper he couldn't comment on the incident.  

Police are now searching for the would-be robber - hoping he won't think about turning to crime again.

He is described as 5-foot-9, with slender build.

'We would like to locate the suspect,' McGee said. 'We’d hate to have him do this again.'

The police chief said he didn't think he could be charged with anything.
