An Ohio K9 handler gave an emotional eulogy about his partner of 12 years - a black German Shepherd named Jet.

At a service on Monday, Patrol Officer Antonio Colon was joined by friends and colleagues as he said goodbye to the police dog.

The dog had been a loyal companion to Colon throughout its career, but when Jet's health rapidly deteriorated last month, the officer knew it was time to say goodbye.

At the service on Monday, a piper played as Colon carried an urn containing Jet's ashes into the police union hall in Cleveland.

Loyal: Jet could always be counted on

Then, with a voice cracking with emotion, he paid tribute to his K9 partner, who had been 'like my son, my brother and my best friend'.

Jet, who had been partnered with Colon in the narcotics department since the dog joined Cleveland police, was 'beyond loyal', he added.

Sergeant Doug Champion, who accompanied Colon to the vet's when it was time for the dog to be euthanized, said Jet never backed down for a fight.

As they arrived at the vet's office, Jet relieved himself on Champion's boot, the sergeant told Cleveland.com.

'I don't know if that was Jet showing me
 what he thought of my supervisory skills, or a sign 
that he and Tony had done some extra training,' he said.

Jet's passing marked the end of an era for his handler, Colon, who is due to retire from his position in the K9 unit after 25 years' service.

He had planned to enjoy his retirement with his K9 partner, which made the loss even harder. 

'He showed me more love, forgiveness and
 understanding than any human had shown me,' Colon said. 'I made more 
friends with Jet by my side than at any other time on this job. He made 
me feel as if we were movie stars, and that the city was our stage.'

He added that although Jet, who was 13 and a half, could strike fear in the heart of criminals, the dog adored and was adored by children.

Moving: Members of the K9 unit joined Antonio and his family for a memorial to Jet

Last summer, the dog had been a popular fixture with children in the city, as he took part in the Pizza with the Police sessions.

'His demeanor was so calm and kind, and the childrenâ€™s faces would just light up when they got to pet him,' a spokesman for Cleveland Police said on their Facebook page.

At the memorial, Colon described Jet as his 'shadow', adding: 'Everywhere I went, he had to be right there with me, by my side.'

For 12 years Jet had accompanied him to work and home, and the officer's family, who joined him at the service, appeared just as upset as Colon.
