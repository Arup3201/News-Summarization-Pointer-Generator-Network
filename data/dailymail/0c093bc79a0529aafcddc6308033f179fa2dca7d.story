Ann Salter was spared jail despite admitting to fraudulently claiming more than £65,000 in benefits

A journalist who swindled £65,000 in benefits after claiming she was too depressed to work has been spared jail.

Ann Salter from Shepperton, Spelthorn, was given thousands in housing benefit, income support and tax relief over ten years after telling council officials she couldn't work. 

The 49-year-old was discovered by investigators after posting a showreel online, boasting of work as a health expert and television presenter. 

Despite admitting to fraudulently claiming £65,478 over the course of a decade, she was today described as a 'a lady of good character' and spared jail after 'striving' to repay the sum. 

Guildford Crown Court heard how Salter, who described herself as a 'successful writer' and presenter in an online CV, had 'sheer determination in recognising her wrongdoing'. 

Despite fraudulently claiming thousands, the woman, who listed working on BBC radio programmes among her experience as a presenter, was of 'good character'.

She was given a year-long prison sentence suspended for 18 months, ordered to pay £5,000 in addition to the money she fraudulently claimed and told to complete 200 hours in community service.

'You are a lady of hitherto good character, and you have positive good character letters in your favour,' said Jude Peter Moss.

‘You have shown much kindness to others as a volunteer... but some feel you do not look after yourself.

‘One of the ways you didn't look after yourself was by claiming benefits to which you were not entitled.

‘This was a serious matter involving public money that should not have gone to you.

‘The total sum involved over that 10-year period was some £65,000.

‘To your credit you admitted these offences and I give you full credit for that.

‘To your credit you have striven to repay that money and indicate the desire to repay the other sums outstanding.

The court heard Ms Salter was of 'hitherto good character' 

‘This goes some way to mitigating the offences. There is no more powerful mitigation than by recognising what you did wrong.'

Defending counsel Darren Flick said Salter had missed out on work opportunities as a result of the negativity brought to her reputation by the court case. 

He added she was a 'caring and vulnerable' woman.

However campaigners said a tougher line was needed in order to deter criminals from fraudulently claiming benefits.   

'We need to cut benefit fraud down to zero, and that means coming down hard on the minority who attempt to cheat the system,' said Andy Silvester, Campaigns Director for the Taxpayers Alliance. 

'It's up to judges to decide on individual cases, but it's important that we remember benefit fraud isn't just stealing from hard-pressed taxpayers but takes money away from those who really need the safety net. 

'It's right that the money is paid back, of course, but if that's the only punishment then clearly a minority will try their luck.'  

Among clips used in her show-reel is footage of the woman presenting for the International Business Times.
