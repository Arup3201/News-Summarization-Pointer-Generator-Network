Scandal book: 'Schooled' written by Carol Ann Eastman under the pen-name Deena Bright

A teacher caused shock among her students after penning a Fifty Shades of Grey style novel.

Carol Ann Eastman faces the sack after writing erotic novel 'Schooled' about a female high school teacher who seeks revenge on her cheating husband, engaging in several affairs with former students and colleagues.

'Schooled' is written under the pseudonym Deena Bright and the Ohio English teacher's novel has gained mainly positive reviews on Amazon.

Ms Eastman returned to Hoover High School in North Canton, Ohio, last week after three weeks administrative leave and five days suspended pay.

Official records show her time off was a punishment for a non-related incident where she used a school computer for ‘social networking of a personal nature,’ the Canton Repository reported.

It is not clear how students discovered that raunchy novelist Deena Bright was in fact their teacher, but the unveiling of Ms Eastman as the author of 'Schooled' has caused an outrage among parents and fellow teachers at Hoover High.

Ms Eastman’s colleague George Baran said he was disappointed that a teacher would write an erotic novel with a school theme as it ‘throws a wrench’ into the perception that teachers have integrity.

Mr Baran, who is also the local teachers’ union president, said Ms Eastman was sent home following complaints from parents.

He added that he believes the school district is looking for Ms Eastman to resign on her own accord but may have begun proceedings to have her fired.

‘I think she found her own attorneys and has chosen to fight, he said. ‘I was very surprised to see her back at school’

Taught a lesson: Ms Eastman was unveiled as the author of 'Schooled' by her own students at Hoover High School, North Canton, although it is not known how

In a ‘special note’ in the acknowledgment section of the book, Ms Eastman pleads with her school district not to give her any repercussions.

“Dear My School District: I love my teaching job. I love raising my kids here, being a part of this close-knit and outstanding community.

'I am proud to be here, honoured and humbled to be a part of this district. Please don’t fire me!

‘I’ve never slept with a student, not even remotely close. I love my students: they’re my kids, nothing more.’

In an interview with an online blogger, 
done under her pen-name, Ms Eastman reveals that she asked her school 
district’s curriculum director for permission to write the novel, but that it 
was denied.

'Schooled' has not been printed, but is available as an eBook on Amazon for $3.

The book's heroine is described as a ‘ever-wholesome and rule-following teacher’ who ‘learns about sexuality, pleasure, and satisfaction from rather unlikely and forbidden teachers, her former students, now recent college graduates.’
