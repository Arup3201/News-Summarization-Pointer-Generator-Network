A 23-year-old woman working as an intern at the Museum of Modern Art has been declared brain dead after falling from a Manhattan rooftop during a going-away party.

Cindy Yeh was attending a party at a friend's apartment on Sullivan Street in Greenwich Village when she danced too close to the edge of the roof and fell off early Sunday morning.

Yeh was rushed to Bellevue Hospital, where she was tragically declared brain dead.

Seriously injured: Cindy Yeh, 23, was pronounced brain dead Sunday after taking a fall from a Manhattan rooftop in the middle of a going-away party 

According to the New York Post, Yeh was attending a party on the roof for three roommates who were moving out of the building.

This apartment on Sullivan Street (above) in Manhattan's Greenwich Village was the site of a rooftop party early Sunday morning

It was around 1:10am when she was dancing close to the edge of the roof, lost her footing, and fell four stories down.

A resident was out for a walk with his wife when he saw the accident unfurl.

'It was like she tumbled down and smashed down in front of the building,' the 25-year-old resident told the Post.

'Her friends ran out of the door screaming. A guy held her and yelled out "She's still breathing"

'Another guy was crying and punching a car, and then we saw two girls crying while calling 911,' he said.

That resident says he watched EMS treat Yeh at the scene before taking her away in an ambulance. 

Another resident in the building says Yeh lost a lot of blood from a head wound.

Neighbors say the apartment building is known on the block for hosting wild rooftop parties.

Yeh was engaged to be married and living in Bushwick, Brooklyn at the time of her death.

It was unclear if her fiance was at the party.

She was working a year-long internship for the Museum of Modern Art and had a bachelor's degree in communication from the University of San Diego.

Yeh's family lives in California and was traveling to New York after receiving the news.
