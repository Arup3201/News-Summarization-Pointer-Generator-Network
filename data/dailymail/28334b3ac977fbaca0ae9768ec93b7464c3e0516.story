John Boehner has revealed he spent the State of the Union speech staring at the back of President Barack Obama's head. 

The House Speaker could be seen throughout the President's hour-long address listening politely but never smiling.

The Ohio Republican said that during the  speech he focused on the president's head in an attempt not to draw attention to himself.

All about you: House Speaker John Boehner says he kept staring at the back of President Barack Obama's head during the State of the Union address, in an attempt not to draw attention to himself

When asked if he practised his scowl beforehand, Boehner said no.

'This is the president's night, and so I sit there and try to make no news,' he told CBS' 60 Minutes.

'Although, inside, I've got a lotta things rollin' through my mind.'

This follows a similar admission from Vice President Joe Biden who said he was bored during Barack Obama's delivery of the State of the Union address.

During an appearance on the Ellen DeGeneres show, Biden said he had to feign interest on camera in the pivotal presidential address.

Biden, Boehner, Bordeom: Vice President Biden has later admitted that he was 'bored' during the one hour long speech  before a joint session of Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington last Tuesday

He compared his actions during Obama's speech to Congress last week to those of a loyal wife who must 'pretend to be interested' while her husband waxes lyrical. 

He told DeGeneres: 'You know I sit back there and I listen and I help write the ideas in the speech and I know it all... I got to pay attention.

'And she [Jill Biden] said, welcome to the club. And I said what do you mean? She said, welcome to the Good Wife's Club.

'She said, how many times have I sat and listened to you make a speech and pretended to be interested?'
