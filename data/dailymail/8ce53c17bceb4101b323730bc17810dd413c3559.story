She's the brave Aussie nurse who has been working deep inside 'the Ebola death zone' since the outbreak of the killer virus .. and has no regrets despite playing almost daily witness to suffering and fatality.

Anne Carey, 56, was one of the first Australians to arrive in Sierra Leone, as the disease began to take a deadly hold on the west African country.

Now well into her third trip, as a volunteer, to the high-risk region, Anne's story is the focus of a 60 Minutes special on the Ebola crisis, to be aired Sunday night on the Nine Network.

She tells reporter Michael Usher of, firstly, her struggle to even get into the country, as most commercial flights to the region were cancelled as the outbreak escalated .. and then the heartbreak of seeing the virus afflict young and old and how it would claim so many victims, many of those she had cared for.

'It doesn't matter who you are, it effects everybody,' she said, admitting that death is around her, every day.

Australian nurse Anne Carey has spent several months in the Ebola-stricken regions of Sierra Leone. She tells 60 Minutes how sometimes the job is about 'comforting' the sick and dying

The awful reality of working in Ebola afflicted areas in west Africa, as Red Cross workers bury another victim of the virus at the nearby cemetery

'It doesn't matter who you are, it effects everybody,' Anne Carey said about the Ebola virus which has claimed almost 10,000 lives across parts of west Africa

The 'violent and deadly virus', which has threatened the population of West Africa, has seen already more than 23,000 people infected, with at least 10,000 known to have died from the causes of Ebola. 

As a volunteer for the Red Cross, Anne is currently on her third trip to the high-risk region, and describes the deadly Ebola crisis as 'an unfair bully'.

‘Sometimes you have to take the bullies on, and win,' she told reporter Michael Usher.

Anne recalled the first patient she ever saw just as she had stepped inside a treatment centre, set up especially to treat Ebola patients.

'I got dressed up in the protective suit and there was a mother with her four-week-old child, and that child as soon as I came into the centre it convulsed, so it fitted, and it proceeded to bleed from everywhere and it just bled to death,' the nurse recalled.

The West Australian nurse started working with Red Cross about 10 years ago.

Her previous assignments include missions to Lokichoggio on the Sudan/Kenya border, tending to war-wounded patients at the Red Cross Hospital and she was also stationed at Darfur, Sudan, in the local feeding centres.

Anne is on her third assignment to help people survive Ebola and control the disease in that part of the world, working as a clinical nurse with the international Red Cross near the town of Kenema and in the Kono district. It's considered among the most seriously affected parts of Sierra Leone.

Anne Carey is one of 27 Australian Red Cross aid workers sent to tackle Ebola, working with more than 200 international Red Cross staff members and upwards of 6,100 local volunteers in West Africa.

Australian Red Cross is one of the few Australian agencies working on the front-line, trying to help bring the disease under control.

60 Minutes says: 'Michael Usher goes to the epicentre of the crisis in Sierra Leone, seeing first-hand the devastation facing those struck down by the virus. It’s a lonely and awful death.

'The front-line battle against this highly contagious virus is terrifying and desperately sad, but Anne’s selflessness and compassion shines like a beacon.'

She admits that sometimes the job is simply to give hope and comfort to the sick an dying. 

Meantime, Sierra Leone, Guinea and
Liberia, the three countries hardest hit by the epidemic, set a target of reducing the number of new cases to zero
within 60 days, the countries said on Monday.

The worst Ebola epidemic in history broke out in late 2013
in Guinea and has killed close to 10,000 people. The
spread of the virus is slowing but the World Heath Organization
warned against complacency.

West Africa recorded 128 new confirmed cases of Ebola in the past week, the first decrease in three weeks.

Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia are the worst hit areas. Here health workers wearing Ebola protective gear remove the body of a man who died from the Ebola virus at the treatment centre on the outskirts of Monrovia

Scares remain, however, Sierra Leone placed hundreds of homes in the capital under Ebola quarantine recently after the death of a fisherman who tested positive to Ebola.

Less than a month after it lifted all restrictions on movement, the government said 700 properties had been locked down in Aberdeen, a fishing and tourist district of Freetown.

'We are on top of the situation and people should not panic,' said Obi Sesay of the government's National Ebola Response Centre.
