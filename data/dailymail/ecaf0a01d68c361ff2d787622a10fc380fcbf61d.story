Older shoppers were less good at spotting bargains in a test done by Bangor University academics

We might expect hearing or eyesight to fade with age – but here’s one change you might not have bargained on.

The older we get, the worse we are at spotting the best supermarket deals, new research has revealed.

Despite years of experience, it is younger shoppers who are more attuned to identifying a good discount.

Scientists at Bangor University, North
 Wales, carried out MRI brain scans on around 30 volunteers who were 
shown a series of offers and told to save as much money as possible.

They
 had to choose what quantity to purchase before moving on to the next 
item – but some of the examples were bad deals costing more than the 
original price.

Imaging techniques highlighted hotspots of brain activity revealing ‘emotional circuitry’ was used to make some decisions.

Researcher
 Dr Paul Mullins said younger shoppers definitely have an advantage, 
adding: ‘It is unusual because one would think that older people would 
be better drilled at evaluating what was and what was not a bargain.

'This is very interesting though we don’t
 know exactly why it happens and would like to do some more research to 
find out why this may be the case.’

The research also shows that women shoppers are no better than men when it comes to being able to identify a cut-price deal.

Instead men are level pegging with women when it comes to saving cash on the weekly shop.

Dr Emily Cross, one of the lead 
researchers, said: ‘The advantage of using MRI to image the brain while 
actively making shopping decisions is that it enables us to see how the 
whole brain responds, including the ‘deeper’ areas of the brain, such as
 those associated with emotion and desire.

Men and women were equally as good at spotting the best cut-price deal, the research found

‘This lets us understand more about what makes an offer appealing: in some cases the choice appears to be more rational, and in other cases we can see emotional circuitry getting involved in the decision-making process.’

The ‘supermarket shoppers’ were taking part in a major cutting-edge project by UK-based SBXL, one of Europe’s leading shopping behaviour specialists.

The results of the study will be passed on to product and food manufacturers who provide goods for supermarkets and stores.

Phillip Adcock, managing director of SBXL, said: ‘We know from previous research that the brain behaves illogically when faced with the sort of information overload that shoppers are faced with in a typical supermarket.

‘Now we have a reliable and scientific way of validating this research and understanding exactly what is happening in the brain during the weekly shop.’
