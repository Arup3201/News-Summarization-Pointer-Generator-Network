Shocking film footage showing the horrific and potentially lethal consequences of driving too fast or failing to pay attention at roadworks was released today in a bid to save lives.

One ‘video nasty’ clip of film shows a lorry overturning, while another shows a truck ploughing into the back of a car.

The footage has been taken from cameras situated within roadworks on England’s motorways and major ‘A’ roads.

It is being posted on the internet to remind drivers of the importance of driving with extra care through roadworks.

Ministers warned drivers that ‘saving a few seconds on your journey is simply not worth it’.

The footage released by the Highways Agency includes a car ‘undertaking' - driving and passing other vehicles on the inside - before pulling out in front of a lorry, causing it to swerve and overturn.

Also on view is a driver failing to spot traffic slowing ahead and crashing into the back of queuing traffic.

Another video shows a lorry ploughing into the back of a car, sending it crashing into a set of roadworks, feet away from working staff.

Roads minister Robert Goodwill said: ‘The safety of those who work on our roads is paramount.

'Saving a few seconds on your journey is simply not worth the cost of the delays caused by these incidents, let alone the devastating impact they can have on lives and families.’

The agency also highlighted some cases of those affected by roadworks’ crashes.

Roger Pomeroy, 51, was helping direct traffic past the scene of an overturned vehicle on the A303 in south west England.

At around 11pm he was hit by a car travelling at around 40mph. The car carried him for nearly 100 metres and then threw him to the ground. He suffered head injuries and broke his leg in two places.

He said: ‘My most vivid memory was of Maxine - my partner - at the hospital just crying and crying. I didn’t know whether I was going to survive or die.’

Mr Pomeroy needed 38 stitches in his leg and head and was off work for six months while his leg healed and he underwent extensive physiotherapy and counselling. He has since returned to full duties.
