A plane parked on an airport tarmac was flipped upside down in 76mph gale force winds.

The light plane was tied down at Campbeltown Airport in Argyll and Bute but hurricane-force winds broke the plane from its bonds, lifted it into the air and turned it upside down.

No-one was inside the aircraft, which weighs about half a tonne, at the time of the incident on Monday.

A passer-by witnessed the moment the plane was overturned, captured a picture and posted it on social media.

Hilary Pope joked: 'It was a tad breezy here last night.'

Others posted: 'Go home, you’re drunk,' 'Aw look, it's sunbathing,' and 'Not a new landing technique then?'

Seamus Macneil said: 'Tell the pilot he needs to leave the ground before trying a loop.'

Bill Davis, a flying instructor at Perth Airport, said: 'This is a very rare thing to happen - I’ve only seen it once in 15 years.

'Usually ballasts and ropes are enough, but gale force winds could have wrenched it free.

A Campbeltown Airport (pictured) spokesman said the incident was 'not something which happens very often'

'These planes aren’t cheap. They can range from £25,000 to over £100,000 when bought new.'

The Civil Aviation Authority said that they are not investigating the incident because it was due to wind, no-one was injured, and no other aircraft were involved.

A spokesman for Campbeltown Airport said: 'This is not something which happens very often.

'Nobody was injured and no other planes were damaged.'
