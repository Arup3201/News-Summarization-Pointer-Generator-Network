Team news

West Brom

Ben Foster is set to hand West Brom a boost for Saturday's Barclays Premier League visit of Everton after returning following his thumb injury.

The goalkeeper withdrew from the England squad after aggravating an existing problem but trained with the Baggies on Thursday.

Joleon Lescott could make his debut after recovering from a knee injury while Georgios Samaras, Silvestre Valera and Sebastian Blanco may feature despite lacking match fitness.

Chris Brunt, Gareth McAuley and Graham Dorrans are available after shrugging off knocks suffered on international duty while Youssouf Mulumbu's hamstring injury and Victor Anichebe's hernia will be assessed.

Provisional squad: Foster, Myhill, Pocognoli, Gamboa, Dawson, Lescott, McAuley, Olsson, Davidson, Wisdom, Baird, Morrison, Mulumbu, Brunt, Blanco, Valera, Sessegnon, Samaras, Ideye, Anichebe, Berahino.

Everton 

Everton manager Roberto Martinez will make a late check on midfielder Leon Osman and striker Samuel Eto'o ahead of Saturday's trip to West Brom.

Osman (calf) was injured in a friendly earlier this week, while Eto'o has been hampered by a groin problem since the defeat to Chelsea before the international break.

Midfielder Ross Barkley (knee) is still a month away from regaining full fitness, but striker Arouna Kone (knee) and defender Bryan Oviedo (broken leg) are both edging closer to a return after playing in the behind-closed-doors game against Stoke in midweek.

Provisional squad: Howard, Coleman, Distin, Jagielka, Baines, Barry, McCarthy, McGeady, Mirallas, Naismith, Lukaku, Robles, Stones, Alcaraz, Gibson, Osman, Besic, Pienaar, Eto'o.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

West Brom’s joint-biggest Premier League home win was a 4-0 drubbing of Everton in November 2005.

Everton have only managed one clean sheet in eight previous Premier League trips to The Hawthorns.

The Toffees have equalled the Premier League record for most goals conceded after three games (10, last equalled by Arsenal in 2011/12).

Samuel Eto’o’s 10 Premier League goals have all come at home, with nine coming at Stamford Bridge and one at Goodison Park, against Chelsea last time out.

Everton have scored a 45th minute goal in all three of their Premier League games this season.

Steven Naismith has scored three goals from three shots on target this season.

England centre-back Phil Jagielka has made a league-high three errors leading to attempts this term.

New Baggies’ signing Georgios Samaras scored his last two Premier League goals against Everton, whilst playing for Manchester City on New Year’s Day 2007.

Romelu Lukaku is still to score a Premier League goal for a club that owns him; his 32 to date have all come whilst out on loan.

Seven of the last 10 league games at The Hawthorns have ended level, with the Baggies winning one and losing two.
