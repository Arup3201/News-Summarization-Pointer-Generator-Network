One man takes the weight, another grips the powerful tail and whoever draws the short straw gets to hold on to the head, his fingers just inches from all those teeth.

All three men were needed to lift this 248lb giant, the largest blue shark to be caught in British waters and a potential man killer.

It was reeled in by 43-year-old Bob Pollard, 11 miles off Penzance, Cornwall, and beats the previous best by 26lb. Skipper Robin Chapman used the tried-and-tested formula of measuring the length of the shark and its girth to calculate its weight before returning it to the sea alive.

'It was just massive': It took anglers Shane Triggs, Bob Pollard, and skipper Robin 'Chippy' Chapman (l-r) all their might to haul the shark on board the fishing boat off the coast of Cornwall

Bob Pollard was fishing in a boat around 11 miles off the coast of Penzance, Cornwall, when he reeled in the mighty catch

For an official record, Mr Pollard and
fellow angler Shane Triggs would have had to weigh the shark on land, 
which would have meant killing it.

Mr Pollard, a builder from St Neot, 
near Liskeard, said: ‘It started off with a very gentle tug on my bait 
but after I began to wind it in, the battle commenced in earnest.

‘I knew it was going to be a decent 
sized fish. When it broke the surface, it was just massive. It took the 
three of us to pull it aboard.’

The shark measured 8ft 3in in length and was 3ft 9in around the middle.

Mr Chapman, 33, skipper of the boat 
Bite Adventures, said: ‘I have had a couple of blue sharks at about 
180lb before. You could tell just by looking at it that this one was 
much, much bigger.

‘We are 100 per cent “catch and release” and Bob would never have wanted to kill such a wonderful fish.’

There are calls for the British Record
Fish Committee to recognise catches that are calculated by measuring 
the length and girth so encouraging fishermen not to kill certain 
species.
