If you move at a snail's pace, you have more time than most to admire the wonders of nature.

And this snail seemed entranced by what must have seemed a vast bubble that it encountered in a tiny puddle on a Ukrainian country lane.

These beautiful close-up images show the snail peering at the bubble and then plunging its head through it.

Taken by dental technician Vyacheslav Mischenko, 48, near his home city of Berdichev in northern Ukraine, they show the mollusc utterly captivated by the gleaming bubble.

Mr Mischenko, who enjoys photographing wildlife in his spare time, said: 'It started a long time ago, my father was a school art teacher.

'He loved to gather mushrooms in the forest, and he started to take me with him when I was six years old.

'As a result, nature became a huge part of my life from a very early age, and I also inherited my father's passion for photography.

'I began to focus on macro (extremely close-up) photography around 20 years ago, and snails are amongst my favourite things to photograph.

'They're fascinating creatures but the main reason I like to take pictures of snails is because they move so slowly there's no danger of them running off while i'm trying to take a picture.

'I think I could have published a book of images, I have photographed snails so much.

'But these pictures are the ones that make me smile.'
