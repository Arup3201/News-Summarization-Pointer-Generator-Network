Around ten per cent of London's homeless are from Bulgaria or Romania, statistics reveal.

Figures released by homeless charity Broadway show there were an average of 1,672 people living rough on the capital's streets between May and October this year.

Of those, an average of 13 were from Bulgaria and 157 from Romania, the charity found.

On the streets: Almost ten per cent of homeless people sleeping on the streets of London are Romanian or Bulgarian

Findings: 53 per cent of those on the capital's streets are from outside the UK, the charity found

This means 9.8 per cent of London's homeless were from the two Eastern European countries on average - almost one in ten.

The average number of homeless people from the UK was 790 - around 47 per cent.

This means 53 per cent of those sleeping rough in London between May and October were from other countries

Romanians were the second largest group, outnumbering those from Portugal, Spain, Ireland, France, Germany and Italy combined.

Influx: Scores of migrants, like this one in central London, are expected to come to the city following a relax on immigration rules on January 1

They were followed by an average of 153 people from Poland.

The findings were included in a report from the Combined Homelessness and Information Network
 - a database commissioned and funded by the Greater London Authority 
(GLA) and managed by the charity.

The report also found in the period September - October 2013, 778 people were sleeping rough in London for the first time.

Homeless: Romanians are removed from the Park Lane area of the city

The figures come ahead of an expected influx of migrants from Bulgaria and Romania when immigration controls are lifted on January 1.

A study by the Public Policy Research says the UK could see an increase in ‘anti-social behaviour’ such as ‘aggressive begging, rough sleeping and even criminality’ as a result of the new arrivals.

It also said the arrivals could put huge pressure on housing, schools and hospitals across the south east and London.

London
 councils spend millions of pounds attempting to tackle the problem of 
homelessness and begging in the capital - some with more success than 
others.

A group of 20 
homeless Romanian beggars living in Park Lane, central London, were 
returned to their native country earlier this year.

But within matter of weeks, six were said to have returned to their camp.

Today, those living on the streets warned those thinking of coming to the capital to stay away.

Speaking to The Sun, one immigrant called Gheorghe said: There is nothing for me in Romania, but there is nothing for me here either.'

Another Bosnan Vasile said: 'I need money to eat, I sleep rough because I can't afford to live anywhere.

'It is easier for a rat or a pigeon to find somewhere to sleep than me.'
