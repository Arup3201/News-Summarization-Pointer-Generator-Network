The only house John F Kennedy and his wife Jackie ever built together has just gone on the market - for an impressive $10.995million.

Known as Wexford, the four-bedroom, five-bathroom ranch house sits on 166 acres in the rolling hills of Middleburg, Virginia, and was completed in 1963 as a retreat for the presidential couple and their two children, John Jr and Caroline.

Amenities other than its historical significance include a swimming pool, a tennis court, views of the Blue Ridge mountains and an underground bunker left over from its past.

Piece of history: Amenities other than its historical significance include a swimming pool, a tennis court, views of the Blue Ridge mountains and an underground bunker left over from its past

With only one story, it's something of a modest home for such a prominent family - though its scenic views and sprawling acreage make up for its humble appearance.

The 5,050-square-foot home about an hour outside Washington, D.C. is painted yellow, with stone walls lining the outside and the pool.

The couple lived in a number of homes together throughout the years, including several townhouses in Georgetown, an estate in McLean, Virginia, and their beach property in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts.

But Wexford is the only residence they personally designed together, building it from scratch to be their ideal family retreat.

Family outing: John F Kennedy and Jackie attend a Sunday Mass in Middleburg, Virginia with their children Caroline and John, Jr in 1963

Ornate: Jackie reportedly hired a White House decorator to help with the home's interior design

Countryside escape: Photos of the interior reveal its rustic charm, with antique pieces and eclectic furniture that gave it a unique appeal

A place to rest your head: One of the four bedrooms consists of a simple space with yellow walls, an antique bedside table and a single window with views of the hills outside

Modern design: The kitchen is a large open space whose walls are lined with marble top counters and appliances. A wooden table for six sits in the middle of the room

Surrounded by forest, it was the 
perfect place for the Kennedy children to play and for Jackie to ride 
her horses - though according to The Kennedy White House: Family Life and Pictures, 1961-1963, JFK himself preferred staying at Camp David.

Other residences: Jackie and JFK also lived in several homes in Georgetown, and often visited their beach house in Hyannis Port, Massacusetts (pictured there with Caroline in 1960)

Kid friendly: Another bedroom contains two single beds, green walls and beige carpeting, with stuffed animals suggesting it is intended for children

Elaborate: The bathrooms were more ornately decorated, with patterned wallpaper, intricately tiled floors and colorful shower curtains

Decor: Floral wallpaper line the walls of one of the bathrooms, and the mirror features a painting of geese

bedrooms, a simple space with yellow walls, an antique bedside table and

different bedroom contains two single beds, green walls and beige

In the more grandiose dining room, ten armchairs sit around the table, a chandelier hangs from the ceiling and an ornate gold-framed mirror sits above the fireplace.

The decor of this room is reminiscent to that of the White House itself; indeed, Jackie reportedly hired a White House decorator to help with the home's interior design.

Wide expanse: With only one story, it's something of a modest home for such a prominent family - though its tennis court (pictured), pool, scenic views and sprawling acreage make up for its humble appearance

Family ties: Jackie reportedly named the property Wexford after the town in Ireland where JFK's family has its roots

Bargain price: The presidential couple purchased the property from a local farmer for $26,000, and it was intended to be their weekend home and an alternative to Camp David

Short life: In reality, though, the Kennedy family only visited Wexford a few times all together before tragedy struck when JFK was assassinated in November 1963

The bathrooms were also more ornately 
decorated, with patterned wallpaper, intricately tiled floors and 
colorful shower curtains.

According to VisitLoudonBlog.com, Jackie named the property Wexford after the town in Ireland where JFK's family has its roots.

Outdoor hobby: Jackie takes her children for a horse ride in 1962 in Middlesburg, Virginia

Convenience: The rustic Virgina property sits just one hour outside Washington, D.C.

Special place: While JFK and Jackie lived in a number of properties during their time together, Wexford was the only home they personally designed and built from scratch

Idyllic environment: Surrounded by forest, it was the perfect place for the Kennedy children to play and for Jackie to ride her horses

In reality, though, the Kennedy family
only visited Wexford a few times all together before tragedy struck 
when JFK was assassinated in November 1963.

After her husband's death, Jackie and her children visited the property one more time before selling it in November 1964 for $225,000.

Later residents included Ronald Reagan and his wife, who leased the property during his 1980 presidential campaign.
