Police released this picture of Anthony Stubbs with baby Lily on the day she was born

A mother has issued a desperate plea for her missing 16-year-old son to come home for Christmas and distributed a picture of him cradling his newborn daughter in the hope it will prompt him to get in touch.

School prefect Anthony Stubbs vanished last month following a row with his 18-year-old girlfriend, just weeks after she gave birth to their daughter, Lily.

He has not been seen or heard from since and it is believed his bank account remains untouched.

Lancashire police hope by publicly distributing pictures of Lily on the day she 
was born, he may get in touch with his family.

Anthony’s mother Denise, 34, broke down in tears at a news conference
 as she said: 'Christmas is a time for family and all I want is for 
Anthony to come home.

'It is his daughter Lily’s first Christmas 
and he should be here to celebrate with her and the rest of the family. 
All the family have support for him - we’re not angry, we just want him 
to come home.”

She added: 'If Anthony was to walk back in it would
 be brilliant - Christmas would be brilliant and him coming back would 
be the best Christmas present ever.

'We just don’t understand why 
he’s gone. he had already made plans for Christmas. He’d already bought a
 stocking for Lily and I urge him to come back for the sake of his baby.

'If
 he has any problems, it’s ok, I know why he went and I know what 
pressure he was under and I just want him to come home so we can sort it
 all out. Running away isn’t the answer, he needs to be with his family.

'It’s
 very out of character to go, he loves his baby so much, he idolises 
that child, the way he looks at her. He might have had pressures but he 
loved that little girl.

'Just tell me his alright - it’s the not 
knowing that’s killing me, I’m jumping to conclusions. I want to make 
sure he’s safe and well looked after - if he’s not ready to come home, 
my door is always open for him, if he or someone could just contact me, 
it won’t take the heartache away, but at least I’ll know he’s safe.

'Anthony
 may have grown up too fast but he can also be gullible and the fact he 
is very loving and caring might lead to some people taking advantage of 
him.'

Following reports of an argument with his teenage girlfriend he 
walked out of their home last month intending to go to his mother’s address a ten 
minute walk away, but he never arrived.

Last September the Year 11 pupil  who is studying for his GCSEs at Wellfield Business and Enterprise 
College in Leyland, Lancashire, was delighted when his girlfriend Charlotte 
Mason gave birth to their daughter Lily.

Despite concerns 
from his family about his schooling, the teenager who is due to sit his 
exams next year set up home with Charlotte and Lily at a house in the 
town.

Anthony who enjoys 
music and outdoor pursuits found out he was going to be dad when he was 
just 15 and had just celebrated his 16th birthday when Lily was born.

The last confirmed sighting of Anthony was as he walked with his schoolbag over his shoulder near to the Seven Stars public house in Leyland at 12:55pm on Sunday 25th November.

Anthony’s family said the day before he went missing Anthony failed to show for at a ceremony where his grandparents were renewing their wedding vows on their anniversary.

Denise added: 'When Anthony didn’t come to the ceremony, I thought it was because he was busy at home with the baby; I didn’t want to interfere.

'But on Sunday at about 4pm his girlfriend sent me a text to ask me when he was going back home to her - and that’s when we realised he was missing.

'I waited until it had been 24 hours and then went straight to the police station on Monday, because I knew then that something had happened.

'He’s a great lad. He always puts everyone before himself, he helps with anything, he is into all his school activities, music, performing arts, he is a head prefect, head of house - a really good student.

'Christmas is going to be empty unless he comes home. He brings life to Christmas and always cracks how own jokes to make me laugh.

'He’d say, ‘Mother Goose cheer up it’s Christmas’ and he’d always put the star up on the tree because I couldn’t reach. His little brother Oscar who is only three keeps asking where Anthony is and I tell him he’s on holiday.

Anthony’s cousin and best friend Katie Smith, 15 said: 'He mentioned that he wanted to move back in with his mum but this was a few weeks before, he just said he’d had enough of living at Charlotte’s.

'I last saw him the Friday of that weekend, we’d finished English revision and we were going out with my mum and dad to get stuff for the wedding - it was my nana’s wedding. That’s the last time we saw him.'

Det Insp John Entwisle of Lancashire Police said: 'We’re following all the leads, all the contacts, we’re pursuing all avenues.

'We’re hoping Anthony will see this and come into a police station - wherever he is and just show that he’s fit and well and we can assure Denise that he’s alive and with us.

'He has a three month old baby at home who we know he must miss and our main aim is to locate Anthony safe and well, and bring him home to his family for Christmas.'
