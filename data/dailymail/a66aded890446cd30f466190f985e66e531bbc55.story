With wide smiles and faces full of hope it is hard to believe that these happy people are living in the squalor of a makeshift shanty town.

Grinning for the camera, the children of the Manila slums act like any other youngsters by playing in a paddling pool and even tying rubber bands together to make bracelets.

This is even though they are some of the poorest people in the world.

Despite being surrounded by squalor in the makeshift shanty town of Tondo in Manila, these children can't help but smile as they play in the street

The images of the playful children were taken by Belgian photographer Sebastien Cuvelier on a trip to the Philippines, where he visisted four slums named Divisoria, Payatas, Quiapo and Tondo, as well as Singkamas in Makati City over a two month period.

The 38-year-old, who now lives in Luxembourg City said: 'I wanted to show everyday life in slums around Manila, where people seem to be happy despite the terrible living conditions.

'The people were incredibly welcoming. Not one smile was forced. No one was ashamed of where they lived. Their dignity was impressive.

'The first time inside any slum is always very shocking; you can't believe your eyes.

'But it was very important for me not to look at them with pity or compassion.

Photographer Mr Cuvelier said: 'The people were incredibly welcoming. Not one smile was forced. No one was ashamed of where they lived'

'I had to act unimpressed and show that I was on the same level as them, even though I was white and had a camera.

'The Filipino people are amazing and always manage to see the positive side of things, which I find incredibly moving.'

Mr Cuvelier visited around 30 homes to offer an insight into the reality of life for civilians living in the slums.

He added: 'Seeing people live on a dump site was shocking.

'You can imagine the smell and the amount of insects when there are acres of trash lying around you in the scorching sun.

'The people there spend their days sorting through the trash, trying to find anything of value, mostly metal.

With poverty widespread many people live in makeshift homes. This family live in a cramped room built under a canal bridge in Quiapo, Manila

'And there, in the middle of the dumping site, was a sign that said 'room 4 rent' I still cannot believe that anyone would actually ask for rent money in such a terrible area, but it is the case in all slums I have visited.

'There is a picture I took, which shows a sole tree in the middle of a sea of trash.

'If this tree could grow there, anything can happen. To me, the tree represents hope for these people.'

The photographer was able to visit the slums while working as a volunteer for a Manila-based French NGO called the Virlanie Foundation.

He explained: 'I was introduced to the Virlanie contact in each slum I went to.

'The NGO reaches out to a wide number of families there so it is very well respected and eased my way in, I could not have been there without the support of Virlanie.'

The Virlanie Foundation is a private, non-profit organisation reaching out to street children in the Philippines and has been helping children who come from difficult situation to become a responsible and an independent adult life with the hope of a brighter future.

For almost 22 years , Virlanie has helped and cared for more than 16,000 children and accompanied towards a responsible and independent adult life
