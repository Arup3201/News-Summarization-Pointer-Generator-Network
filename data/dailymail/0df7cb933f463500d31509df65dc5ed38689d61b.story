Boys as young as seven and eight have been questioned by police on suspicion of rape, shocking figures reveal. 

They were among almost 1,000 children under ten accused of serious crimes in Manchester over the past three years but never prosecuted because of their age.

In North Wales two boys aged nine were also accused of the same offence over the past 24 months.

A rape claim was also registered last year involving a six-year-old boy, although it is believed to have been carried out more than 40 years ago.

Data released by police under freedom of information laws reveals that in Manchester the boy of seven was accused of raping a girl under 13. 

The eight-year-old was suspected of raping a girl under 16.

In other cases, a girl of nine was accused of carrying a knife or blade at school, while a six-year-old boy was suspected of possessing cannabis.

Thirty-one children in North Wales were suspected of causing actual bodily harm, the youngest being a girl of just six in 2012.

Children under ten are considered too young to be held criminally responsible for any wrongdoing.

Des Mannion of NSPCC Wales said pornography was ‘warping young people’s views of what is normal or acceptable behaviour’.

‘Prevention has to be the key and that means recognising warning signs early and taking swift action,’ he added. 

‘For very young children we have to question the environment in which they are growing up that has led to them behaving in this way.

‘It could be that they have seen sexual activity that they are just too young to understand and are copying what they’ve seen.’
