Robert Lewandowski has warned his Poland team-mates their historic win over Germany will count for nothing if they slip up against Scotland.

The Bayern Munich superstar set up the clinching goal for Sebastian Mila as Adam Nawalka’s side caused a Group D sensation by defeating the world champions 2-0 in Warsaw on Saturday evening.

It was Poland’s first-ever victory over Germany at the 19th attempt and leaves them in a powerful position ahead of Scotland’s visit to the Stadion Narodowy on Tuesday evening.

Lewandowski believes, however, that the match against Gordon Strachan’s side is the most important part of their Euro 2016 double-header. And he is adamant that only another triumph will suffice in their bid for automatic qualification.

‘We made history against Germany, but it’s still only three points,’ insisted the 26-year-old striker.

‘If we lose against Scotland, we will have only picked up three points from the two matches and that’s not enough.

‘There is no secret that Germany will win this group easily and our biggest rival for second place is Scotland. So that’s why it is so important we beat them on Tuesday.

‘I thought we were very effective against Germany. Okay, we did not create many opportunities, but when we had those chances, we took them.

‘We have to take a great deal of confidence from that - that’s what happens when you beat the world champions.

‘Possibly, we gave Germany too much respect at first, but with each passing minute, I thought: “Hang on, we can win this match and make history”. And we did.’

Polish FA president Zbigniew Boniek echoed Lewandowski’s thoughts as he demanded full focus on the threat presented by Strachan’s side.

‘We had several excellent individual performances against Germany and the rest of the team fought fiercely for this result,’ said the former Juventus and Roma great.

‘But now it is time for the match against Scotland. Let the fans enjoy Saturday’ s victory, and savour it. Our players do not have the time to do that.

‘We cannot think we are now great, because it is not true. We will stay humble and concentrate on a difficult match against the Scots.’
