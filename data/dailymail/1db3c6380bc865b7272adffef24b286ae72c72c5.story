A quick thinking Florida mother saved the life of her young child by pushing him out of the way just as an out of control SUV driven by a drunk driver barreled into the restaurant the two were eating in.

The vehicle ran a red light and smashed into another car before careening into the Orlando, Florida, Popeyeâ€™s December 30. No one inside the restaurant suffered serious injury.

Phillip Brown, 26, was charged with DUI with serious bodily harm, driving on a suspended license and failure to obey a traffic control device, according to WESH.

Run!: The SUV can be seen through the window as the mother and child scramble to safety

The surveillance video shows a seemingly normal meal being enjoyed by the mother and her child.

The pair soon jumps up and darts out of the way, eluding certain death, only seconds before the rented van plows into the corner table where they were sitting.

Mr Brown ran the red light and collided with a Ford Focus just before hitting the fast food restaurant, WESH reported.

The driver of the Ford, two women and an 
eight-year-old boy inside the restaurant were rushed to the hospital, 
but none suffered any life-threatening injuries, sources told the 
station.

Mayhem: The corner of the restaurant was destroyed by this out of control SUV

It is not known if the woman and the young child shown scrambling to safety in the video were among the injured taken to the hospital.

Mr Brown did not require hospitalization for his injuries.

An arrest report cited by the station said he screamed profanity at police who tried to communicate with him at the scene.

Cops smelled alcohol on his breath, he had slurred speech and could barely open his glassy, bloodshot eyes, the report said. He also could not keep his balance.

Mr Brown also refused field sobriety tests and refused to answer any questions, said the report.

The intoxicated man also fell asleep several times while being held in the Orange County Breath Testing Facility, police said.

A sobriety test was able to be performed after a warrant was obtained to draw his blood.

Lynx Vanpool, which rented the van to Mr Brown, told WESH the van was rented to the man two months ago and that he had a valid license at the time.
