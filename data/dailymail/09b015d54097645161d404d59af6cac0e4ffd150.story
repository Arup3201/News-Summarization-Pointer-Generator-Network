Two speedboat drivers were lucky to survive a horror crash that saw their boat flip through the air twice before smashing upside down on to a lake.

Mike Fiori and Joel Begin were at the wheel of the speedboat when it seemed to take off on the Lake of the Ozarks, Missouri, on on Saturday.

Both men miraculously survived the 150mph crash, and Mr Begin, from Quebec, has already been released.

The closed canopy Outerlimits Powerboat  was taking part in a race on the Lake of the Ozarks, Missouri

Spectators cheer as the speedboat, driven by Mike Fiori and Joel Begin, races past them at 150mph

But suddenly the boat's front end begins to lift and soon the entire craft is airborne and starting to flip in the air

Spectators' cheers turned to screams of horror as the Outerlimits Powerboats closed canopy boat rose from the water during a boat race on the lake.

Wind interference caused the boat to take off and flip over twice before coming to a rest, Missouri Highway Patrol said.

Mr Fiori, from Bristol, Rhode Island, owns the boat company and was the throttle man at the time, Ozarks First reported.

He was airlifted to University Hospital in Columbia after the crash and is in a 'stable' condition.

Mr Begin, who owns the crashed boat, was taken by ambulance to Lake Regional Hospital in Osage Beach and has been released.

Miraculously neither of the men died the horror crash, however Mr Fiori is still in hospital in a stable condition

For a split second the speedboat was upside down and flying through the air over the usually placid lake

Outerlimits Powerboats wrote on their Facebook page: 'We would like to take this opportunity to thank all for the concern and overwhelming support.

'We would like to let everyone know that Joel Begin has been released from the hospital and Mike Fiore is stable and responsive. We will release any new information when it's available.

'We ask that everyone please respect the privacy of the families and individuals involved.'
