A lost bravery medal awarded to a homing pigeon that was the first to bring news of the D-Day landings back to Britain has been discovered after 69 years.

The Dickin Medal - the animal version of the Victoria Cross - was won by a bird called the Duke of Normandy that was dropped behind enemy lines with Allied paratroopers hours before the invasion.

The men were to capture bridges at the eastern end of the Normandy bridgehead and head towards the beaches to link up with the main invasion force.

Cooped up in a small cage, the grand cock breed was released by a paratrooper at 6am on June 6, 1944, with a message attached to it relating to the success of the drop.

As was normal with World War Two carrier pigeons, ‘The Duke’ flew back to its owner’s loft who then contacted the War Office.

In spite of strong winds and being shot at by German riflemen, the bird arrived in one piece 26 hours later, bringing vital news of the momentous operation.

The Duke was one of 32 pigeons to be awarded the Dickin Medal for their heroics in the war.

It was thought his gong had been lost over the course of time but it turned up in a box of old badges bought by a collector 25 years ago.

Even then, the unnamed owner had no 
idea what it was until several Dickin Medals were featured on an episode
of the BBC’s Antiques Roadshow last month.

He dug it out and has made it available for sale at auction, with a pre-sale estimate of 10,000 pounds.

Steven Bosley, of Bosley’s 
auctioneers of Marlow, Bucks, said: “As radio silence was of utmost 
importance during the paratrooper part of D-Day, the role of racing 
pigeons became crucial.

“Many of them were kept in small cages and were dropped with the Allied paratroopers of the 21st Army Group but The Duke was the first to arrive back with news.

“Once the paratroopers could ascertain the success of the operation, they released at 6am with a message.

“Inspite of bombs and bullets, northerthly gales in the Channel and heavy rain, he returned to his loft in 26 hours and 50 minutes.

“The information he brought back was crucial to the War Office in London.”

During World War Two, the Allied Pigeon Service was set up and involved over 200,000 birds being given to the armed services.

Those that flew over Nazi-occupied Europe were part of the Special Pigeon Service.
In 1943 Maria Dickin, founder of the 
People’s Dispensary of Sick Animals (PDSA) set up the Dickin Medal to 
honour the bravery of animals in the war.

The citation for The Duke’s states: 
“For being the first bird to arrive with a message from paratroopers of 
the 21st Army Group behind enemy lines on D-Day.”

Mr Bosley said: “A private individual from Kidderminster bought the medal by chance 25 years ago when he bought a box full of military badges.

“He didn’t know anything about it until he saw one featured on TV recently.

“Dickin Medals awarded to pigeons are rare because there are only so many of them so they do command good prices.”

The Royal Pigeon Racing Association owns five of of these medals.

Stewart Wardrope, general manager of the associatin, said: “The Germans had special teams called Hawk units based along the coast which were snipers and their job was to try and shot England-bound pigeons out of the sky.

“All the pigeons were interested in was getting home but they regularly had to fly through shot and fire to do that.

“They returned to their owners who then made contact with the military and passed on the coded messages.”

The auction takes place on July 3.
