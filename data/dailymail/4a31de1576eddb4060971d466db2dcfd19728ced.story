Officials have been collecting DNA samples from relatives of families who were on board Malaysia Airlines MH17, as well as conducting extensive interviews with close family as they attempt the difficult process of identifying the bodies from the airline.

The families have also been contacted daily by a counselor provided by the airline to check on their well-being.

A relative of nun Sister Philomene Tiernan, 75, who was on the plane, said officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade took DNA samples from her sister, Madeleine.

She was also asked in a five-hour interview to detail all her sister's clothes, jewellery, likely handbags and provide as many photographs as possible to help Australian crash investigators identify her body.

Sister Phil is being celebrated as a kind, loving woman who guided the students of Australia's three Sacred Heart schools: Kincoppal-Rose Bay in Sydney, Sacre Coeur in Melbourne and Stuartholme in Brisbane.

‘It has been a big process. Phil’s [Philomene's] last living sibling, Madeleine, underwent a four or five hour process with DFAT to make sure they have everything possible to find our Phil,' Jillian Tiernan, her sister in law, said.

‘Madeleine gave a sample of her DNA. She gave details about Phil’s handbag, her jewellery, anything Phil would have had on her.

‘Madeleine gave lots of photos of Phil so they know exactly what she looks like, so they have every chance of finding her.’ 

Mrs Tiernan said the family believed the Australian Government was doing all could to bring the bodies of their loved ones home.

Mrs Tiernan admits that there is so much uncertainty with the investigation and reports from the Ukraine that up to 100 bodies were still missing.

‘I don’t think the government knows what is happening next, but they’re doing everything they can to keep us informed along the way. We all need to have hope.’

Jillian Tiernan says there was pain in not knowing when their Phil will be brought home.

'We have lots of memorials planned, but we won't know when to hold the funeral until we have the body. It's so hard not knowing,' she said.

As someone who has lost a family member, Mrs Tiernan says they just hope that there will be a peaceful resolution as a result of this tragedy.

'You can just hope that everyone works to bring some peace to the region. You hope that all those deaths will not be in vain and that somehow, something good comes of it.'

Mrs Tiernan is grateful for the support they have received from the Australian government.

‘DFAT has offered every support. Phil’s sister Madeleine received a lovely letter from the Prime Minister.

‘Malaysia Airlines have also been very apologetic, providing counseling to the whole family. I get a call from a counselor every day, checking in to see how I’m going and helping me through.'

It is a bittersweet time for the Tiernans, who had welcomed a new baby who Phil was eager to meet.

'Phil was so dearly loved by our whole family.'

'Last Sunday, a new granddaughter was born, Phil's grand-niece.

'I sent Phil photos of little Aislin and she couldn't wait to come back and meet her. She sent emails saying how delighted she was and that she couldn't wait to come home.'
