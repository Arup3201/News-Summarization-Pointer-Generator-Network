Gone are the days when a biscuit and a bone were considered a treat for our pets. Nowadays, we lavish our four-legged friends with toys, feed them expensive organic delicacies, allow them to share our beds and even take them on play dates.

That's according to a new survey of more than 1,000 owners of dogs, cats and small furry friends such as rabbits and guinea pigs by recently launched online pet boutique, Astar Pets.

The findings reveal pet owners spend on average £70 a month on their treasured friends, which is more than Brits spend on cake, cosmetics and even holidays.

Of the 1,000 pet owners surveyed, 90% bought Christmas presents and 60% birthday presents

With 65 million pets in the UK and 45 per cent of UK households owning a pet, Britain is certainly a nation of pet lovers.

But the survey found a staggering 88 per cent of owners admitted giving their pets as much care as they give their own children.

CEO Chris Webster, who co-founded 
Astar Pets with Quentin Griffiths (founder of both Achica and ASOS), said: 'The UK has transformed from being a nation of pet owners to being a nation of pet parents who enjoy spending time 
with and treating their pet.'

In their role as 'pet parents', 90 per cent of owners buy a Christmas present for their furry friend, 66 per cent give them a birthday present, 84 per cent allow their pet on the sofa and 66 per cent extend the privilege to their bed.

Brits are a nation of 'pet parents' - 88% admit treating their pets like their children

And that's not where the parental similarities end. As many as 30 per cent of pets are taken on play dates with other animals.

On average, our nation's much-loved animals own seven toys and 60 per cent of pets receive a treat each week.

In fact, one in six pet owners revealed they spend more on presents for their pet than for their partner. Almost half spend over £50 a month on their pet, while a generous 5 per cent spend over £250.

Our passion also extends to their 
health and well-being. Close to half buy their pets specialist or 
organic food brands, 28% include vitamin 
supplements in their pet’s daily meals and all 1,000 owners surveyed 
said they visited the vet at 
least once a year for an annual check-up.

The
 survey also revealed that 'pet parents' feel guilty when leaving their 
beloved surrogate child for extended periods with a third organising 
pet-sitters or walkers when they are out during the day and 58% buying a
 present for their pet if they have been away on holiday.
