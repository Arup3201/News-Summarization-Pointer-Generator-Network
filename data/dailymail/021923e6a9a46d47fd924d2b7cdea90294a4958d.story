This did not have quite the same snarling intensity to match the East Midlands derby at Welford Road last week but Bath showed enough devil against their West Country rivals to prove that again they are serious Premiership players.

Exeter took the field with the intention of repeating their autumn victories over heavyweights Saracens and Northampton. But they finished dominated, defeated and floundering against the ropes as Bath hit them with wave after wave of muscular attacks.

When Anthony Watson scythed through Exeter’s tired defence with two minutes left to score the home side’s fourth try, and secure an important bonus point, Mike Ford’s men could reflect on a job emphatically done.

Just as they did in the European Champions Cup against Montpellier a fortnight ago, Bath demonstrated an unstinting determination to complete the mission. The Chiefs will come again but this was a sound lesson for their youngsters.

‘It was pleasing to get that last try from Anthony because I thought he was outstanding, as were a lot of people,’ said Bath head coach Ford. ‘We’ve got threats all over the park and we’re in a good place. We’ve not won anything in 2014 but the one thing we are doing is getting better. I’m delighted with the intent we showed.’

Bath’s victory was again built on the cornerstone of an immensely impressive forward display — with Stuart Hooper, Leroy Houston and Francois Louw the pick of a very good bunch — which enabled their hugely gifted backline to cut Exeter to ribbons.

Four tries to two was the least the home side deserved, with both the visitors’ scores coming as the result of forced mistakes rather than any creative brilliance.

Much as Exeter’s highly promising threequarter line attempted to pick holes in Bath’s defence, they were starved of possession and overpowered with ball-in-hand.

Time after time they coughed up possession in the first half and despite some bullish charges from centre Sam Hill, the Premiership’s third-placed side at kick-off made few inroads.

Exeter director of rugby Rob Baxter, whose side lost at Sale last week, said: ‘I’ve got no complaints about the result, although I’m disappointed with the amount of ball we turned over.

‘Yes, it’s back-to-back defeats but we’ve had two away games during a tough period. I’m not worried. That result won’t decide if we win the Premiership.’

As is customary, George Ford pulled the strings for Bath, with centres Kyle Eastmond and Jonathan Joseph playing flat to the line and cutting clever angles as the back three of Matt Banahan, Horacio Agulla and Watson went looking for work with enthusiasm and intelligence.

It would have been a travesty if Bath had not claimed a bonus point. Banahan had a first-half try correctly ruled out for a marginally forward inside pass from the outstanding Eastmond and they spent the past 20 minutes almost permanently camped in the opposition 22.

When Watson finally sealed the bonus point, which could prove invaluable come the end of the season, Bath’s dominance was complete.

Agulla, Eastmond and replacement lock Dave Attwood scored Bath’s earlier tries, while Jack Nowell and Matt Jess both took advantage of mistakes to briefly give the visitors hope of an upset by levelling at 14-14 after 46 minutes.

But Bath’s superior strength and depth told. After Attwood drove over with 53 minutes on the clock, and fly-half Ford added a penalty, head coach Ford was able to bring on rugby league convert Sam Burgess for an 18-minute cameo.

The 18st powerhouse had little chance to make an impact but his cult status at The Rec is assured, judging by the reaction of the 13,349 capacity crowd to his entrance.
