Shocked investment bankers learnt they had lost their jobs yesterday – when they were refused entry to their offices.

Traders at financial services firm UBS said they arrived for work in the morning to find their security passes wouldn’t work.

A source claims the dramatic steps 
were taken amid fears employees might squander vast sums of the 
company’s money in ‘kamikaze’ spending sprees if they knew they were 
about to lose their jobs.

UBS, which has around 6,500 staff in its London office (pictured), said the restructuring would deliver savings of 5.4 billion Swiss francs

The redundancies came as part of a worldwide cull of 10,000 staff at Swiss banking giant UBS.

More than 1,000 London-based staff are
expected to be axed in one of the biggest bank layoffs since Lehman 
Brothers went bankrupt at the start of the financial crisis four years 
ago.

The first 100 British-based traders to lose their jobs discovered their fate when they turned up at work yesterday.

Human resources staff clutching 
clipboards led them from the building’s reception into meeting rooms, 
where they were told they were being put on ‘special leave’ on full pay 
while the terms of their redundancies were worked out.

A source said bosses could not risk 
allowing them to get to their desks and start trading huge sums of the 
company’s money on the stock market knowing they were due be laid off.

One trader based at the  bank’s 
offices in Liverpool Street said: ‘We all knew it was coming because 
there have been various stories in the press, but I don’t think anyone 
expected it to be as brutal as it was.

UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti called the decision a 'difficult one'

‘Basically some people turned up to 
the building and found their passes weren’t working – that’s how they 
found out they were sacked.

‘They were just kind of ushered off into side rooms by these HR people with clipboards and told that that was it.

‘They weren’t even allowed up to the trading floors to clear their desks. It was horrendous.

‘Even for those of us who haven’t been
sacked it’s really upsetting. It makes you think twice about whether 
you want to work for a company like that anyway. I  suppose there’s no 
good way of doing it but whatever the best way is, it certainly wasn’t 
this. It’s no way to treat people.’

The mass redundancies come  just a 
year after it emerged the bank had lost £1.4billion following alleged 
illicit dealing by former UBS trader Kweku Adoboli, who is currently 
standing trial.

But UBS blamed the job losses on 
tougher financial regulation in the aftermath of the global economic 
crisis, which has made investment banking less profitable.

The Zurich-based bank plans to cut 
staff from 64,000 to 54,000 globally by 2015, with three-quarters of the
job losses expected to be made in London, the US and Asia.

The company’s chief executive Sergio 
Ermotti said: ‘This decision has been a difficult one, particularly in a
business such as ours that is all about its people. Some reductions 
will result from natural attrition and we will take whatever measures we
can to mitigate the overall effect.

‘Throughout the process we will ensure that our people will be supported and treated with care.’

However, UBS denied deactivating the security passes of staff being made redundant before they arrived at work.

The bank, which has around 6,500 staff in London, said the job cuts would save £3.5billion by 2015.

The cull follows a 40 per cent plunge in its pre-tax operating profits to £1.5billion in the six months to June 30.

UBS claimed the fall was caused by the
botched stock market listing of social network Facebook, which cost the
bank £227million. It blamed the loss on the ‘gross mishandling’ of the 
flotation by Nasdaq, which involved a series of technical errors that 
caused a delay in the start of trading of Facebook shares in May.

Former UBS banker Adoboli is accused 
of gambling away £1.4billion during the financial crisis, in the UK’s 
biggest ever fraud trial.

He denies being a rogue trader, 
telling Southwark Crown Court last week that he was pressured by senior 
colleagues to make riskier trades. His trial continues.
