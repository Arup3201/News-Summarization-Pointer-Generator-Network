Sunderland vs Liverpool (Stadium of Light) 

Team news

Sunderland

Sunderland boss Gus Poyet has an almost fully fit squad to choose from for his side's Barclays Premier League clash with Liverpool on Saturday.

Midfielder Lee Cattermole is the Black Cats' only major doubt as he struggles to recover from the groin injury which has kept him out for the last two matches.

Patrick van Aanholt could keep his place at full-back after an impressive return from injury when he scored the winner in the FA Cup clash with Leeds last weekend.

Provisional squad: Pantilimon, Mannone, Jones, Brown, van Aanholt, O'Shea, Vergini, Coates, Bridcutt, Rodwell, Gomez, Larsson, Johnson, Buckley, Alvarez, Mavrias, Giaccherini, Wickham, Fletcher, Altidore.

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers will not have any of his injured players back in time to face Sunderland at the Stadium of Light.

Midfielders Adam Lallana (thigh) and Joe Allen (knee), defenders Glen Johnson (thigh) and Jon Flanagan (knee) and goalkeeper Brad Jones (thigh) all remain sidelined.

Injury has prevented Daniel Sturridge playing for Liverpool since August but he is close to a return

Striker Daniel Sturridge is back in the country but still a fortnight away from a long-awaited return from a thigh problem while defender Kolo Toure is on African Cup of Nations duty with Ivory Coast.
