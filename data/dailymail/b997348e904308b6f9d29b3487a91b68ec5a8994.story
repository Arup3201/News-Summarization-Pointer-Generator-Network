Soaring: The AA warned the wholesale cost of petrol across Europe has been driven up, which has led to price rises at the pumps

Petrol prices are set to rise by 5p a litre just as the summer getaway begins, the AA has warned.

It blames the increase at the pumps on profiteering speculators ‘betting on rising oil prices’.

They buy huge quantities of petroleum on the open market and store it until the price rises and they can sell for a handsome profit.

This has already driven up the wholesale cost of petrol across Europe and led to price rises at the pumps – with more to come, the AA says.

The warning comes days after competition watchdogs came under fire for rejecting demands for an inquiry into the lack of transparency in the fuel markets.

The AA said: ‘It was perhaps inevitable that oil and fuel market speculators would cast a black cloud over what was promising to be a glorious summer.’ 

Also, the pound has fallen against the US dollar, the currency in which oil is traded, making it more expensive for UK buyers.

On average, UK petrol prices have risen by more than 1p from 134.61p a litre in mid-June to 135.78p now. Diesel has risen from 139.16p a month ago to 140.24p.

The AA said: ‘A $100-a-tonne increase in the cost of petrol across north-west Europe,  combined with a weaker pound, heralds a potential 5p increase  in pump petrol costs.’

Profiteering Speculators: The rise is said to be down to the practice of buying large quantities of petroleum on the open market and waiting for the price rises to make a profit
