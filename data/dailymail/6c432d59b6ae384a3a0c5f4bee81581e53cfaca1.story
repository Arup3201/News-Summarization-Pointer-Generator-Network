Kim Kardashian West's stay in UAE doesn't appear to be getting any less luxurious. 

Over the weekend the reality TV star dined in YUAN, the  decadent Chinese restaurant and bar at Atlantis, The Palm, where Kim is staying.

Dressed in a sleek black dress with nude sandals, she stopped by the fine dining restaurant with producer friend Carla Dibello, who wore a grey wrap dress, and her entourage.

Since its launch almost a year ago, YUAN has seen a flurry of starry guests including international supermodel Jourdan Dunn and ex-Made in Chelsea cast member turned fashion designer Millie Mackintosh.

Kim  posed for pictures before ordering from the menu, which has been devised by executive chef Jeff Tan, formerly of Hakkasan Mayfair. 

House favourites include braised seafood with bean curd served in clay pot and stir-fried 'You Mai Cai' lettuce with black bean preserved fish.

As one-half of one of the world's most powerful superstar couples alongside Kanye West, Kim has become accustomed to a life of  luxury, with private jets, Beverly Hills mansions, and designer clothes worth more than the average person's annual salary.

So, it's not surprising that she has checked into a magnificent suite at the restaurant's hotel, Atlantis The Palm, which costs a staggering AED129,000 - over £22,430 - per night.

The 924 square-metre Royal Bridge Suite spans the entire arch of the now-iconic structure, with dramatic 180 degree views across The Palm and the Arabian Sea.

Kim, 34, has documented her stay a;ready by staging a Sex and the City-style entrance, mimicking a scene in the movie sequel which saw Carrie and the girls enter their palatial suite at a fictional hotel in neighboring UAE capital, Abu Dhabi.

The mother-of-one and her friends strut down the marble hallway, and walk on to one of the suite's two terraces to take in the view. The impressive balcony spans the length of arch on either side.

Accessed by a private lift that takes guests the 22 storeys above the hotel, the Royal Bridge Suite houses three sumptuous bedrooms, which sleep six adults and three children, and four bathrooms plus a powder room.

Atlantis The Palm has become iconic for its unique, arched design, and a favourite with the A-list

Kim arrived in Dubai on Friday with her entourage, and wasted no time throwing herself into enjoying the luxurious lifestyle.

The reality star took to the water on a boat with her crew, including Fast and the Furious actress Michelle Rodriguez.

Snapping a picture of the view from her room, Kim wrote: 'Words can't describe how grateful I am to be back in Dubai. I love it here so much!'
