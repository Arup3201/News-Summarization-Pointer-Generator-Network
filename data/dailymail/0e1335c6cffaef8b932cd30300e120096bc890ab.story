The body of a pensioner lay undiscovered at a sheltered housing complex for a month - and was only found when maggots 'dropped down through light switches' in a residents' flat.

The housing association which manages the site has apologised following the discovery at the complex in Maidenhead, Berkshire.

Berkshire coroner's office said the man was believed to be Benigno Lacey, 74, but formal identification was still taking place.

His body was discovered at Blandford House in the town after he was understood to have lain undiscovered for up to four weeks.

The body was only found after maggots were discovered in the building's hallways.

One Blandford House resident, who did not want to be named, said a neighbour had noticed maggots 'dropping down through the light switches' in her flat.

He added they initially thought the smell was from a dead cat.

The tenant says he and his neighbours estimate the man may have been dead for three to four weeks.

He said: 'There are still flies flying around.'

Housing Solutions manages the site and said it has now cleaned contaminated areas to get rid of the infestation.

A letter to tenants from Housing Solutions said: 'It is with great regret and a heavy heart that I have to inform you that your neighbour has passed away.

'Unfortunately, due to the circumstances of the death Housing Solutions were unable to react as quickly as we would have liked.

'We are aware this is an unpleasant situation and apologise for the inconvenience caused.'

The letter goes on to say the number of maggots should 'decline' as a result of the cleaning and the level of communal cleaning would be increased to'reduce any further impact on residents'.

A spokeswoman from Housing Solutions said: 'Sadly one of our sheltered housing residents was found dead in his flat.

Housing Solutions, who manage the complex, have issued an apology to residents for the inconvenience 

'This resident had signed a disclaimer that he did not want daily contact with our staff, just monthly health and safety visits.

'We would like to apologise to our customers for any inconvenience this has caused.'

Police confirmed they were called to a property in Ashcroft Road on October 30.

The death was being treated as unexplained but 'not suspicious' and the details have been passed to the coroner.

As well as identifying the body, the coroner's office is trying to trace Mr Lacey's next of kin.
