As news of the sudden death of Hollywood star Robin Williams spread, it appears some Twitter users have firmly grasped the wrong end of the stick.

Perhaps hitting their phones and laptops before checking the news, they spoke of their shock at the death of Robbie Williams, the former Take That singer.

Numerous social media commentators wrote commiserations like: ' I loved you in Take That and Angels was my favourite song' or 'I can't belive that #RobbieWilliams Is #gone. It feels in our hearts & spirits we will remember him with laughter and love!'

Even Real Madrid defender Sergio Ramos got in on the act. He tweeted: 'Dismayed at the death of Robbie Williams. I always liked his songs.'

The hashtags #RobinWilliams and #RIPRobinWilliams were trending as stunned film fans struggled to come to terms with their loss. But #RobbieWilliams also made an appearance thanks to the mistaken tweeters.

However, Harvinth Skin was not impressed with the errors. He tweeted: 'Hi. Please don't embarrass yourself. Robin Williams and Robbie Williams aren't the same people. Thanks.'

TalkSPORT presenter Alan Brazil provoked anger today after saying he had 'no sympathy' for Robin Williams.

The radio host claimed the star's apparent suicide was selfish considering the effect it would have on his loved ones.

He said: 'I believe he’s got a daughter as well, what’s she feeling like this morning? Now she’s got to sort the arrangements out. I think it’s shocking, I really do.

'I don’t have a lot of sympathy, I’m sorry.'

Twitter users were not impressed with his comments.

User Matt307 tweeted: 'Depression is a serious illness, to have "little sympathy" for Robin Williams shows the ignorance of Alan Brazil.'

Michael Howarth added: 'Disgusting to read the comments made by @alanbrazil about Robin Williams. I hope @talkSPORT will be doing something about it!'

The station apologised on the presenter's behalf.

A spokesman said: 'TalkSPORT would like to apologise for any offence caused. Alan’s comments do not reflect the views of the station.'

Brazil added that when his wife informed him of the death, he thought former Take That star Robbie Williams had died.

'It didn’t hit me hard - it would have been if it had been Robbie and thank God it wasn’t,' he said.
