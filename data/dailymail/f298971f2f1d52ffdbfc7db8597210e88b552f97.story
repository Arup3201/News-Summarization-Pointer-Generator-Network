Shocking video has emerged of a young girl being hit by an out of control car trying to evade police.

Eight-year-old Cassidy Wall was riding a scooter last week in front of her Erie, Pennsylvania, home when the car careened off the road, spun around and slammed into her – she suffered a concussion but is expected to otherwise be okay.

‘I fell and flew in the air, and I landed on my head,’ she told WICU of the horrifying experience.

Just like any other day: Cassidy Wall rides her scooter along the sidewalk in front of her family's home

Cassidy Wall’s younger sister was only feet away but ran to safety as her older sibling was knocked head-over-heels into the sidewalk.

‘The car crashed in and then she [Cassidy] got hit,’ five-year-old Zmyiah Wall said. ‘She flew all the way up in the sky and fell on her head.’

Driver Angelo Moore, 18, was running from police when his car bowled over the child, presumably to avoid drug charges leveled on him and friend Brandon Carlson once police arrested them.

His reckless driving left Cassidy Wall with a concussion and Zmiyah Wall with only bumps and bruises – injuries for which he was also given aggravated assault by vehicle.

The girls’ grateful father could be seen in the video running to his daughter’s side, he is relieved the outcome wasn’t worse.

‘I was terrified. I still am terrified,’ said Delorean Wall. ‘As a father, you don’t want that to happen to your children. It’s crazy.

‘It could have happened to anybody’s kids, and it could have been worse,’ he continued. ‘So all I can tell people is just to watch your kids.’

The incident also left Cassidy Wall shaken even a week later.

‘Every time cars come past me when I'm at home, I just go in the house,’ said Cassidy. ‘Right now, I'm scared of cars because of what just happened to me on Friday night.’
