Friends turns 20 on Monday, and to celebrate, a new report reveals the 'friendcestual' habits of Britons up and down the country.

A third (32 per cent) of all respondents say they have done a Ross and Rachel by dating within their friendship circle.

One in ten (10 per cent) are fans of trying it on with multiple pals by having kissed more than two of their friends. 

Two in five (40 per cent) of 25-34 year olds having previously dated a friend

The survey suggests many Britons are turning to dating their friends in their search for love, with one third admitting they have had romantic feelings for a friend.

Two in five (40 per cent) of 25-34 year olds having previously dated a friend, while almost one quarter (24 per cent) of all Britons say they have had a sexual encounter with one of their mates. 

Just like Monica and Chandler, whose relationship developed from a night together, almost a fifth (19 per cent) of Britons have kissed a friend on or after a drunken night out. 

However, the research showed that dating within your friendship group can have its drawbacks. 

Almost one in five (17 per cent) of 18-24 year olds, and ten per cent of 25-34 year olds revealed that their relationship with a friend did not end well, whilst 13 per cent of 18-34 year olds said that they regretted getting involved.

More than one in ten (13 per cent) of 18-34 year olds said they would like to meet someone outside their friendship group. 

Almost one in five 18-24 year olds say that their relationship with a friend did not end well

But almost one fifth (19 per cent) admitted they find it hard to meet people when they are out, as they just talk to their friends.

Many of us are familiar with the love triangle of Rachel, Joey and Ross, but one in ten of 18-24 year olds have also been involved in a love triangle within their friendship group. 

Echoing another of Friends famous storylines, eight per cent of 25-34 year olds admitted that they have dated a friend's brother or sister.

The research also showed that men are more likely to get involved with their friends than women; 38 per cent revealed they have developed romantic feelings for a friend, compared to just 29 per cent of women.

As iconic TV series Friends turns 20, dating website match.com reveals just how common dating your friends is in real life through their latest report.

Kate Taylor, relationship expert for match.com, reveals the pitfalls of friendcest:

'Friendcest is an easy trap to fall into. If you socialise in a close circle of friends, your opportunities to meet new people can be limited. 

'This may also scare off potential daters, who could be wary to approach you if you're always in a large group, and your social life might keep you so busy that you don't make time to look for love.

'Dating a friend might feel like the perfect solution, but there are dangers. You might have friends in common, but not necessarily share the same interests, goals or ambitions. 

'You might stay in an unhappy "Friendcestuous" relationship longer than you should, because you're scared of splitting up your social circle or losing some of your mutual friends. 

'You might mistake friendship for love, and be disappointed if the relationship never delivers on passion, romance or excitement.

'I'd advise other ways to find the perfect match for them, rather than just looking around to see who's nearby.

Sometimes, like for Ross and Rachel, it can work out. But other times, like for Rachel and Joey, it's doomed
