Hillary Rodham Clinton is defending the nearly quarter-million dollar fee she charges for speaking engagements at colleges and universities after students at one university demanded that she return the fee she collected for a speech she is slated to give in the fall.

Clinton responded to the criticism during an interview this week, saying that the enormous sums of money she's collected for speeches she's given over the last 18 months has gone towards her family's charity, The Clinton Foundation.

Clinton's wealth has been under scrutiny since an interview last month 
in which she described her family as 'dead broke' and in debt when 
husband Bill Clinton left the White House in January 2001.

The potential 2016 presidential candidate later 
called that description 'inartful.'

Last week, students at the University of Nevada Las Vegas threatened to protest Clinton's visit to the university - where she is scheduled to speak at the university's Foundation Dinner in October - if the former secretary of state didn't return the $225,000 fee for her speech.

'All of the fees have been donated to the Clinton Foundation for it to 
continue its life-changing and life-saving work. So it goes from a 
foundation at a university to another foundation,' Clinton said during an interview with ABC News when 
asked about the criticism she and her husband have faced recently for 
their wealth.

Clinton didn't say whether she planned on returning the money, and defended her fee by saying that her speaking engagements are used to present 'new ideas to help strengthen the economy, which in turn, will help lower income inequality.'

'It’s been my experience,' Clinton said, 'That they’re not worried about
 my speaking or my household, they’re worried about their own. And 
that’s the kind of debate I think I’m furthering as I go around the 
country speaking.'

Clinton has spent the past month traveling around the world promoting her recently released memoirs, Hard Choices.

During the book tour, Clinton has repeatedly made comments about her family's wealth that have caused critics to say she is out of touch.

'We came out of the White House not only dead broke, but in debt. We had no money when we got there, and we struggled to, you know, piece together the resources for mortgages, for houses, for Chelsea's education. You know, it was not easy. Bill has worked really hard - and it's been amazing to me - he's worked very hard. First of all, we had to pay off all our debts, which was, you know, he had to make double the money because of obviously taxes and then pay off the debts and get us houses and take care of family members,' Clinton said during a June 9, interview with ABC News.

On June 21, Clinton continue to defend against her critics' in a June 21, interview with the Guardian newspaper.

'They don't see me as part of the problem because we pay ordinary income
 tax, unlike a lot of people who are truly well off, not to name names, 
and we have done it through dint of hard work. We know how blessed we 
are. We were neither of us raised with these kinds of opportunities, and
 we worked really hard for them. But all one has to do is look at my 
record going back to my time in college and law school to know not only 
where my heart is, but where my efforts have been,' she said.

Clinton and her husband have an estimated net worth of more than $100 million.
