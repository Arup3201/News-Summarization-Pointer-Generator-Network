Joachim Low has spoken of his fear that his all-conquering German side will experience burn-out as they seek to add the European Championships to the World Cup they lifted in Brazil back in July.

Jerome Boatang, Mats Hummels and Sami Khedira will sit out their country’s clash with Argentina in Dusseldorf on Wednesday evening – although only the latter remains a doubt for the Euro 2016 curtain-raiser with Scotland in Dortmund on Sunday.

Just 52 days after watching Philipp Lahm lift the game’s biggest prize in Rio, Low is deeply concerned that a lack of proper rest for his star performers coupled with the demands of elite club football will adversely affect their chances of a smooth qualification passage.

And Low – who has named Bastian Schweinsteiger as his long-term skipper despite the Bayern Munich man also being currently sidelined – intends to counter the burn-out issue throughout the qualifiers by drip-feeding uncapped players into his squad.

Management: Low intends to blood uncapped players throughout Euro qualifying to restrict their workloads

‘It’s exciting that the Bundesliga has just begun but it’s clear there is a World Cup aftermath – the effect of playing lots of games in such a short period of time,’ he said.

‘Many players need more rest. Many have approached the season with knocks and problems that they probably inherited from the World Cup.

‘That will be a factor in the next few weeks and months.

‘It will be difficult for me and the Bundesliga coaches to bring all the players in their squads up to the same level.

‘We respect the qualifying system. But we have many young players trying to get into the squad, like Erik Durm (of Dortmund).

‘We have to give these players an opportunity when the established ones are ruled out for whatever reason.

‘So we definitely need this qualifying process to take the up and coming players by the hand – and allow them to be blooded for the highest level.

‘Look at Toni Kroos, for example. We might need to leave him out if he’s irreplaceable for Real Madrid. I have to accept that because sometimes World Cup tournaments can affect players’ stamina and physical condition.

‘It’s difficult for them to have just three weeks’ holiday and then go into pre-season training. They’ve been thrown into the deep end again very quickly.

‘So it’s likely that they’ll fall into a “performance hole” and suffer a little crisis. That’s when other players have to step up to the mark.

‘For the established players, it’s been very hard for them to get back to normal in the Bundesliga so I need potential candidates in my squad to fill their positions.’

Low’s immediate thoughts are with a rematch against the nation they defeated in Rio to lift their fourth world title.

But, with the more meaningful game against Gordon Strachan’s side lying around the corner, he admitted the Scots would not have been the team of choice to face in the first competitive game since the triumph in Brazil.

‘Scotland is the kind of team Germany have always struggled against,’ he added.

‘With Scotland’s sheer commitment and their running – they are a team who never give up no matter what the score is – then they are difficult opponents.

Tight unit: Low and his now captain Bastian Schweinsteiger will lead the next wave of Germany players

‘Their fans get right behind them and drive them on.

‘If you look at this group and the likes of Scotland and Ireland, they come across as similar teams.

‘They have similar playing styles, who excel for their passion and the physicality of their football.

‘We know this group is anything but easy because all the teams will try as hard as they can to make life difficult for us.

‘The likes of Scotland have not been at the last few tournaments so they will give their all to be at the next European Championships.’

While the focus must now be on the Euros, Low feels drawing a psychological line under what went on in South America may prove easier said than done.

‘It’s nothing that comes automatically and it’s almost impossible to tell players to forget the World Cup,’ he conceded.

‘It’s difficult for players to motivate themselves and be fully aware of the situation.

‘It won’t be easy but we want to win the game on Sunday.

‘Despite the fact we have some players missing we still have enough quality to beat opponents such as Scotland.

‘But, that said, it won’t be easy over the next few months.

‘We won’t have players playing at the same level because some will have personal ups and downs, physical difficulties.

‘Their bodies will demand a longer period of rest, so things will be different in the months ahead.

‘The players will be robbed of physical strength because of the World Cup. Rio was really great but the message has to be – let’s now focus on Paris 2016. That cycle begins with the match against Scotland on Sunday.’
