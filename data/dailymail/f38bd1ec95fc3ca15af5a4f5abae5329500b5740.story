As many as 800 homemade tacks have been discovered scattered around a park with the deliberately-placed dangerous objects being labelled as a malicious and cowardly act.

Yarra Council parks crews have conducted an extensive search of Edinburgh Gardens in North Fitzroy using a high-powered magnet sweeper everyday since a resident found two in the grass of the Melbourne park told last Friday. 

So far there have been an astounding 800 tacks found which look to be made out of chicken wire with multiple spikes - and some are as large as a ten cent coin.

Homemade tacks, as large as 10 cent coins, were found throughout the Edinburgh Gardens in North Fitzroy

Yarra Mayor Phillip Vlahogiannis said the spread of tacks in Edinburgh Gardens was a senseless criminal act intended to cause injury.

'We are working closely with police to help them find whoever is responsible for this malicious and cowardly act,' he said.

Cr Vlahogiannis said the park crew have been working through the extreme heat of the past few days searching the gardens both manually and using a high powered magnet sweeper.

'Our crews will be back at the gardens tomorrow to continue sweeping,' he said.

'In the meantime we strongly advise people who are walking, jogging, enjoying the playground with their children and exercising pets to be extra careful. 

'Cyclists too need to be aware that some tacks have may have ended up on the paths.'

Council is urging the community to report any suspicious behaviour or information about who might have done this to Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.

Park users who find any tacks are asked to report the specific location to council by calling 9205 5555.

The community has been warned to take care as the dangerous objects have multiple spikes
