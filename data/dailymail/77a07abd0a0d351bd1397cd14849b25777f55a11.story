Fired: Brian Lewis worked for Fox News as CEO Roger Ailes' right hand man and was escorted from the networks headquarters on Tuesday after he was fired

A top Fox News Channel executive who is considered to the right hand man to Roger Ailes was physically escorted from his office and fired after an investigation into financial irregularities on Tuesday.

Brian Lewis, the executive VP of corporate communications was let go after he was found to be in breach of contract and had worked alongside Fox New Channel president Ailes since the network was founded 17 years ago.

While details about the allegations of financial wrong-doing were not available as of Tuesday, insiders said that it was difficult for Ailes to let Lewis go, such was the closeness of their relationship.

Lewis began work at Fox News 
headquarters in New York in 1996, six months before the powerful network 
launched to air and was made an executive VP in 2006.

'After
an extensive internal investigation of Brian Lewis' conduct by Fox 
News, it was determined that he should be terminated for cause, 
specifically for issues relating to financial irregularities, as well as
for multiple, material and significant breaches of his employment 
contract,' a company spokesperson said on Tuesday.

'He was terminated for cause on July 25.'

Brian
Lewis acted as a spokesperson and trusted lieutenant at Fox News for 
Roger Ailes, 73, who was handpicked by Rupert Murdoch to helm the 
fledgling news channel.

While
the exact reasons for Lewis' firing are not known, witnesses said that 
it was sufficient enough for him to be escorted out of the door from Fox
News headquarters in Manhattan's Midtown according to The Hollywood Reporter.

On
Monday, Lewis was still listed as an executive on the Fox New website 
and his accomplishments were listed as, 'Launching the Fox News Channel 
to overwhelming consumer awareness, creating and implementing successful
campaigns favorably positioning FNC against competing networks and 
corporations, and handling all crisis situations that have threatened 
the network.'

As of Tuesday, this had been taken down.

Fox News was embarrassed last month after Fox host Geraldo Rivera, 70, tweeted a very revealing nude self-portrait

The bombastic broadcaster captioned the picture '70 is the new 50', before admitting that he might embarrass his wife and family.

Rivera deleted the shot hours later, but the damage had been done.

The photo spread instantly round the 
internet with users expressing differing levels of disgust and 
admiration for the physique of a 70-year-old man.

In June, Sarah Palin rejoined the Fox News Channel.

The former Republican vice presidential candidate has signed on as a contributor to Fox and the Fox Business Network, the network said today.

Her first appearance is scheduled for Monday on the 'Fox & Friends' morning show â€“ on the same day CNN is premiering a morning show to great fanfare.

Fox and Palin parted ways in January after she had worked there for three years as a contributor.

They had talked about renewing their contract, but it didn't happen.

Money may have been a factor: Palin was signed for a reported $1 million a year when she originally joined Fox less than two years after being John McCain's running mate.
