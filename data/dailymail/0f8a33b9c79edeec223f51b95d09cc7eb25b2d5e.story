A wine baron has reportedly sold his private beachfront home in an exclusive Sydney suburb for $30 million.

The Point Piper Edwardian-era residence is located on Wunulla Road in Sydney's east and was sold off by former Cellarmasters owner John Piven-Large.

Pillinger real estate agency's Brad Pillinger - who is behind the sale - refused to comment to Daily Mail Australia about the property.

The Point Piper home is the sixth house in the suburb to be sold for $30 million or more in the past five months

The Edwardian-era home boasts six bedrooms with ensuite bathrooms, and was built around 1913

But a source told Domain that it was sold for $30 million after it was believed another offer of $28 million was rejected in late July.

This is the sixth property in the Point Piper area to have sold at $30 million or more this year, which means - after Friday's sale - about $200 million worth of real estate has been offloaded in the beachside suburb in the past five months.

The house, which was built around 1913, boasts six bedrooms and is one of four homes in the suburb to offer a clear view of the Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge.

It was restored by respected architect Espie Dodds to keep its Edwardian features, including a timber staircase and a number of mantelpieces.

Adding to its lavish interior and exterior, the house boasts a private beach which stretches 28 metres before hitting the water

The design of the house features peaked roofs and a balcony that allows its new owners to enjoy the sweeping views of the iconic Sydney Harbour.

Guests can also take in the view from terraces which are pocketed in pristine gardens.

With an open plan from the living areas to the outdoors, the house runs into a 13-metre pool where the new occupants can swim a few laps with an unrivalled backdrop.

Every bedroom in the house has its own bathroom with some having their own outdoor areas.

But the master bedroom has added luxury with a dressing room and sizable terrace.

Despite its age, the house's kitchen has modern facilities - such as a premium Paul Bocuse dual oven and caterer's panty - set in timber surfaces.

It also has an annexed caretaker's apartment with a kitchenette, living room, bedroom and bathroom. 

Mr Piven-Large is believed to have bought the Point Piper property when it was sold as a duplex in 1991, offering $2.2 million for one part and $1.3 million for the other area.
