England fans found a way of entertaining themselves during the routine 5-0 win over San Marino by voting virtual spectator Joe Hart man of the match.

Midfielder Jack Wilshere was the official recipient of the award, but he was a clear second in the poll behind the goalkeeper, who did not make a save during the game and only touched the ball 19 times.

Wilshere took 11 per cent of the vote with Hart, a spectator for most of the time at Wembley, taking 63 per cent.

Joe Hart was effectively a spectator against San Marino, but fans voted him man of the match anyway

More than half of England fans voted Joe Hart as man of the match despite him having nothing to do all game

Goalscorers Wayne Rooney and Danny Welbeck were third and fourth in the vote, but England fans were clearly intent on causing mischief by voting for Hart.  

The stadium announcer had to stop reading when he saw the man of the match was the home side's No 1 and waited until after the final whistle to award it to Wilshere.

Who says England fans don't have a sense of humour?

Phil Jagielka broke the deadlock with a header midway through the first half before Welbeck,  Rooney and Andros Townsend found the net. Alessandro Della Valle also put one past his own keeper.

The win takes England top of Group E, level on points with Lithuania.
