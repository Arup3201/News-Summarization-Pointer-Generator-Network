When Ebony, 33, first met  her  husband of three years, Peter Florian, 65, it was love at first sight.

The fact that she was 17 and the mechanic was 48, made no difference to her - she just felt a strong attraction despite the fact they were both already spoken for.

In fact, the age gap between the Norfolk pair was the least complicated thing about their new connection as Peter was in a relationship with Judy, the mother of Ebony's boyfriend.

Ebony said: 'Age was never an issue. I just saw a man I really liked and possibly fancied. That's all I thought about, although I did feel guilty,' she revealed on Channel 5 show Age Gap Love, which airs tonight.

The couple embarked on a secret affair.

She said: 'The first time [we had sex] was amazing, it rocked my world. I have never been loved like that before.'

But Peter (also known as Flit) was worried about the age difference and ended their affair, going on to marry Judy - leaving Ebony heartbroken.

He said: 'I thought she was a bit of all right but that she was too young to handle. I thought, "I mustn't do this, she's too young".' 

Ebony admitted she felt 'used' and went off the rails, drinking and taking drugs. 

The pair say they are happy despite the 32 year age gap. Even Flit's ex-wife says they make a lovely couple

Flit was once step-grandfather to Ebony's two children as his ex-wife is their grandmother

She also had two children with her boyfriend, Judy's son - who she then split up with. But she lost custody of them when she was imprisoned in 2010 for committing a violent act. 

During her time behind bars, Peter split up with Judy and began visiting Ebony.

'People used to think I was visiting my daughter,' he said.

The couple fell in love again and as soon as Ebony was released in 2012, they ran off to Gretna Green to tie the knot.

Ebony said it was the happiest day of her life. 

'It was everything I had hoped for, the man I had loved for so long was now my husband,' she said.

The couple were able to provide a stable home for Ebony's two children so custody was restored.

Her eldest son, Dominic, 15, said he doesn't mind that his new step-father (who was once his step-grandfather) is so much older than his mother.

He said: 'I would rather my mum is with an older man than a younger man who doesn't treat her right.' 

Remarkably, Judy isn't bitter about the fact her ex-husband ran off with a younger woman - who was also the mother of her grandchildren.

She said: 'Once I got my head around it, I'm fine. Flit and Ebony are a lovely couple, they are made for each other.'

There are 40 years between Jo, 30, and John, 70, pictured on the Channel 5 show

Ebony and Peter aren't the only ones who have found happiness despite a huge age gap.

The Channel 5 show also features married couple Jo, 30, and John, 70, from south London.

Thanks to their 40-year age gap, Jo said they do provoke comments from people when they are seen out together. 

She said: 'People say it's nice to go out with your dad. When I say it's my husband they are shocked. If I give him a kiss, people will do a double take.

'Once we went to the cinema and asked for two tickets - we were given one for an OAP and one for a child!'

The couple met when Jo was 21 and John was 61. 

Jo recalled: 'My initial reaction was "he's old" but when we started talking it became irrelevant. I could tell this guy wanted to look after me and give me advice if I asked for it.'

Jo said they don't care what people think about their age gap relationship. She said John has been 'her rock' after a difficult period in her life

At the time, Jo was a single mother-of-two who was struggling with her confidence after being bullied as a child.

She credits John, a natural health expert, for helping her get her life back on track. 

She said: 'I had a really tough time for five or six years. I almost completely lost it and the reason I haven't is John. He's been a complete rock. He's been amazing.' 

She added: 'It has made a difference him being older. I think if I met someone younger or closer to my age they wouldn't have been able to comprehend what I had been through. John understands how life events can change you so age makes a huge difference there.'

John's son, Matthew, from a previous relationship is actually closer in age to Jo at 21.

But he said he doesn't mind having a step-mother who is nine years older than him.

He said: 'I don't think the age gap matters as Jo is mentally older and my dad is young at heart.'
