A schoolboy drowned after jumping off a 10-ft high bridge into a river with friends despite not being able to swim.

Twelve-year-old Hamse Darman jumped into the Jubilee River near Slough, Berkshire, with his friends but quickly disappeared beneath the surface.

Emergency services were called to the 
scene last night after Hamse’s friends rushed to nearby homes to raise 
the alarm when he vanished in the murky water.

Police and fire crews searched for the 12-year-old and found his body just after midnight this morning.

Neighbours told youngsters often ignored repeated warnings about the dangers of the river and continued their daredevil antics at the spot.

'They were jumping off the bridge into the water,' said a woman, who didn't want to be named.

'It was Hamse and two others. Hamse was not a swimmer so it looks like he has jumped in and got into trouble.

'The other two managed to get out and raise the alarm.'

The river was especially constructed as 
part of a flood defence scheme after years of torrential rain threatened
 to engulf the flood plains around Slough, Maidenhead and Windsor in 
Berkshire.

She told how police, paramedics, firefighters and a police helicopter spent hours searching the water and the river banks for the boy.

'The Jubilee River is an overflow from the River Thames and although it appears calm, the current is very strong,' said the woman.

'The water is also far deeper than it looks and I have no idea what is in there.'

Hamse is believed to have been a pupil at nearby Westgate Secondary School, where he had just completed his first year.

Four bunches of flowers had been left on the centre of the bridge, which links Cippenham, Slough, to Eton.

'It is an absolute tragedy,' said the woman. 'But what nobody can understand is why they were jumping in yesterday when it wasn’t that hot.

Tributes: Flowers can be seen on the bridge where Hamse had jumped off with his friends - just a few metres from a warning sign saying: 'No jumping, No Diving'

'When it has been really warm recently we have had lots of kids congregating up there and jumping in.

'Those who live around here are always telling them to be careful but they never listen.'

A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said: 'We were called last night to Wood Lane in Cippenham, to reports that a young boy had gone into the river.

'At about 8pm, the 12-year-old got into trouble in the Jubilee River.

'A full search was launched to find him but his body was discovered shortly after midnight.'

Detective Sergeant Lucy Deane, from Slough CID, said: 'The incident is being thoroughly investigated but we do not believe there to be any suspicious circumstances at this time.

'Our thoughts go out to the family of this young boy, who has become the victim of what appears to be a tragic accident.'

She added: 'I also would like to emphasise that although it might be tempting to jump in the river when the weather is warm, there are often hidden dangers under the water and so we would advise against doing so.'

Hamse’s body was taken to the mortuary at nearby Wexham Park Hospital for a post mortem examination to be carried out to determine the exact cause of his death.

Police said the case had been referred to Berkshire Coroner Peter Bedford and a report would be compiled to allow him to hold an inquest.

The Jubilee River was built in the late 1990s and early 2000s by the Environment Agency as a £110 million pounds scheme to protect surrounding towns from flooding.

It is up to five metres deep in places.

It was not known whether the agency had opened the gates to increase flow through the seven-mile channel following recent rainfall.
