A mother begged a court to stop doctors withdrawing treatment from her terminally-ill child.

At a late-night emergency hearing, the woman insisted her 18-year-old son should be given another chance to beat his brain tumour. She said it seemed doctors ‘wanted him to die’.

But Mrs Justice Hogg ruled that medical intervention could end and he should be put on palliative care. As of last night his condition was unknown.

The mother used a telephone link from the hospital where her unidentified son was being treated to address the Court of Protection late on Friday night.

A neurosurgeon said the teenager had no more than two weeks to live and active treatment was futile.

But the mother said: ‘I don’t want to hear you say he has to die. I don’t want to be part of that. I’m afraid I can’t. I am fighting for my child’s life.

‘He is a sick child but he is coping. He is not dying. Give him a chance. Maybe chemo will work. He may have months to live.

‘It just seems you want him to die. The sooner the better. It makes me worry you are not acting in his best interests. You just want it to get over and done with.’

At one point during the hearing Mrs Justice Hogg ordered a break to allow the mother to go back to her son’s bedside.

She said her son was absolutely adored by his family and they believed he would pull through.

‘He is a miracle child and has survived things you thought he would not. He deserves a chance,’ she added.

‘Doctors should treat the patient to the very end. That is how I see it. He deserves the right to be treated.’

Mrs Justice Hogg was told the teenager had been diagnosed with a brain tumour at the age of one.

Although also registered blind, he had been able to go to school, travel and play some sports.

But doctors said that his condition had deteriorated and the cancer had spread.

He could not walk or talk, struggled to lift his limbs and was ‘going in and out of coma’.

But the parents disagreed that treatment should be stopped.

The boy’s father had travelled to London to attend the hearing but returned to his son’s bedside after doctors said his condition had taken a turn for the worse.

He held the phone for his wife as Mrs Justice Hogg made her ruling. The judge said the boy had shown resilience and courage, adding: ‘His mother has fought every corner for him. And he has fought a few corners for himself.’ But the judge said she had to base her decision on the evidence and decide what was in the teenager’s best interests.

She made no criticism of doctors or medical staff.

‘The evidence shows that he is in the last phase of his life,’ she said. ‘The doctors say the time has now come for palliative treatment only.

‘I am satisfied that chemotherapy should not be resumed.’

She said the teenager should get as much palliative treatment and care as possible.
