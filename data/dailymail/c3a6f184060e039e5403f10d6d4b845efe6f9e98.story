Reneged: MPs said the Prime Minister faces a backlash on plans to legalise gay marriage as members resign in mass protest

David Cameron is facing a backlash over his support for gay marriage from within his own party as members desert Tory ranks in droves, it emerged today.

Large numbers of activists are resigning or refusing to renew their membership in protest at the Government's plans to equalise marriage, MPs say.

It is claimed those quitting range from a handful in some seats to dozens in others and more than a hundred in some.

Although Tory party headquarters has no up-to-date record of membership, the evidence of MPs points to many hundreds if not thousands, of deserters.

'This is the straw that broke the camel's back,' one MP told The Times.

David Burrowes, MP for Enfield Southgate and an opponent of gay marriage, said: 'There's serious unrest in the grass roots.

'You cannot avoid the fact that the troops are unhappy. People are drifting away.'

It comes as Mr Cameron dashed Tory hopes of a tax break for married couples in next month’s Budget.

A senior Government source said the Prime Minister had delayed the manifesto promise yet again after talks with George Osborne.

The Chancellor does not want the issue of the tax break to distract from the Budget’s focus on the economy.

The decision will dismay many Tories who were demanding action on the flagship pledge. It was hoped that the tax break would help to quell the anger over the decision to press ahead with a divisive vote on gay marriage next week.

Former leader Iain Duncan Smith, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling and Environment Secretary Owen Paterson are among the Cabinet ministers who have lobbied Mr Cameron to act on tax for married couples.

They argued that it was vital to bring the measure in now, so married couples would feel the benefit before the election – warning that it would be dismissed as a ‘token’ gesture if it was delayed again.

A senior Government source last night 
said the Prime Minister – who was yesterday on a visit to Monrovia, 
Liberia – remained committed to the policy, but agreed to a delay after 
talks with Mr Osborne, who has always been less enthusiastic.

‘The recognition of marriage in the 
tax system will be put forward,’ the source said, adding, ‘It won’t be 
in this Budget but it will be in this Parliament,’ suggesting it will be
enacted before the next election, due in 2015.

The Government's gay marriage proposals do not go far enough, according to a poll of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.

The controversial introduction of same-sex marriage will be put to a Commons vote next week.

But in a survey, six out of 10 gay people said the Government's plans would not create 'equal marriage', and that equality would only be achieved when churches, synagogues and mosques are required to carry out same-sex weddings.

The poll found that half of all LGBT people expect the courts to remove the remaining protections on places of worship.

Nearly two-thirds (62 per cent) believed Prime Minister David Cameron was trying to extend marriage to LGBT people to make the Tories look more compassionate rather than because of his convictions.

The poll - which questioned more than 500 LGBT people - was commissioned by the Coalition for Marriage - an alliance of groups and individuals opposed to attempts to redefine marriage.

‘It’s
an agenda the Prime Minister is very committed to,’ the source said. 
‘It will be put forward – it is right to recognise marriage and 
recognise commitment. It’s in the Coalition agreement and I can confirm 
it will be going ahead.’

Under Mr Cameron’s plans, it is 
expected that one member of a married couple or civil partnership would 
be allowed to transfer £750 of their tax-free personal allowance, 
reducing their partner’s tax bill.

This would be worth about £150 a year
to basic rate taxpayers.

On Thursday, the Daily Mail reported 
that Mr Cameron was signalling the tax break would be left out as the 
Government struggles to control spending.

Confirmation of the delay 
comes days after Nick Clegg poured scorn on the idea of the tax break.

He said people would think it ‘odd’ to help families on the basis of whether they were married or not.

The
Lib Dem leader, whose MPs will be allowed to abstain on the break when 
it does comes to parliament, said: ‘The more people will look at this, 
the more they will think – why should you be giving, whatever it is, £3 a
week to married couples.’

The Prime Minister is said to disagree with those Tories who say acting on marriage tax was a ‘quid pro quo’ for forcing through gay marriage.

A source said: ‘There is a link between the two in that he believes strongly in both for similar reasons. If two people want to commit to each other and get married, and if they’re gay, they should be able to.

‘He also believes in recognising commitment in the tax system. There is a connection but there is not a quid pro quo.’

The source said Mr Cameron acknowledged that gay marriage was a ‘difficult’  issue for some in the Conservative party but said that he was ‘proud’ to be championing it.

Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'Our complicated tax system makes it harder for people to start a family and often discriminates against married couples.

'Introducing an allowance that lets families share some of their personal allowance would help tackle poverty and reduce the perverse disincentives created by our dysfunctional tax code.

'The Government could go much further and reform our tax system to help everybody who is struggling with the cost of living, not just married couples.'
