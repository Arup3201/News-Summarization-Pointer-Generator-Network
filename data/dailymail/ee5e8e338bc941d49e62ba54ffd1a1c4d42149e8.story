Friday 13th lived up to its chilling reputation today for two separate groups of hot air balloonists - after their craft blew off course.

One stray balloon narrowly avoided tragedy after blowing into power lines in North Yorkshire, while another caused chaos at Gatwick Airport by straying into the path of departing flights.

Amazingly nobody was hurt - but they will prompt some people to question if superstitions about the unluckiest day of the year are true after all.

A Hot air balloon with 9 passengers and one pilot collided with 66,000 volt power lines in North Yorkshire today

The balloon crash landed perilously close to a pond

Nine passengers and a pilot were onboard the balloon that crashed into cables carrying 66,000 volts of electricity as it attempted to land near Selby, North Yorkshire at 8.15am.

The power automatically shut down 
after the collision and the people in the basket, which crashed to the 
ground just feet from a large pond, were able to scramble to safety.

Part of the blue and yellow balloon was hanging over the power line and 
in the water as emergency teams arrived at the crash site.

The Air Accident Investigation Branch has launched an investigation have interviewed the pilot, John Russell.

Mr Russell, who has 25 years’ experience, said he was trying to land at 
an arranged location and was coming down at 3mph, when a 20mph gust of
 wind blew the balloon 200 metres across an embankment and into power 
lines beside a pond.

He said: “I have never had anything like this happen in 25 years - but what day is it today? - Friday the 13th.”

A spokeswoman said engineers were 
attempting to remove the balloon from the lines before repairs can 
begin, but the supply in that section of the cables had been isolated 
and there had been no power disruption to homes in the area.

Suspended: Five flights were delayed at Gatwick this morning by the drifting balloon (file photo)

The balloon was being operated by 
Balloon Rides, a subsidiary of Hampshire-based Adventure Balloons which 
runs flights in Yorkshire.

A spokeswoman for Adventure Balloons said: “On landing, there was an 
increase in the surface winds and the balloon caught the wire, but there
 were no injuries and minor damage to the balloon.”

Just 45 minutes after the balloon 
came down in Yorkshire, a second craft was spotted drifting into the flightpath at Gatwick, Britain's second busiest airport.

No planes were able to take off for a
 little under half an hour while police and air traffic controllers 
searched for the balloon in thick fog.

A Gatwick spokesman said: 'The airport is not closed and arrival flights are 
still landing, but departing flights were suspended for safety reasons.' 

The delays prompted stranded passengers to take to Twitter to share Friday 13th conspiracy theories.

One flyer with the user name @SkyOlympicOrla wrote: 'Sat on a plane for 
the last hour because of fog. Now told a hot air balloon is overhead and
 Gatwick's shut. Is this Fri 13th or April Fool?!'

But not every delayed passenger was complaining. Travellers on one flight
 were kept occupied with guided tours of their jet's controls.

Twitter user Eleni Read wrote: 'Hot air balloon over Gatwick so the pilot is giving tours of the cockpit while we wait.'

The identity of the Gatwick balloon pilot has yet to be revealed.
