The chances of a team managed by Jose Mourinho giving up a seven-point lead with 14 matches left is as likely as Aston Villa boss Paul Lambert putting Chelsea’s staff on his Christmas card list.

Mourinho walked off the Villa Park turf a winner for the first time — too quickly for Lambert to shake his hand — but insisted he would only see Chelsea as champions when the title was sealed.

‘A Jose Mourinho team is a team like the others,’ he said. ‘If we have a seven-point lead with two matches to go we are champions.

Villa’s run without scoring was the fourth worst in Premier League history.

'If we have a seven-point lead with three matches to go we need two points. And it’s not three matches, it’s 14, so there’s a long time to go.’

By May, this may well be viewed as a pivotal weekend in the title race, one when the leaders recovered from conceding to the worst attack in English football while Manchester City failed to beat lowly Hull at home.

It can also be seen as another chapter in the fraught relationship between Chelsea and Villa. Lambert was left seething by the behaviour of a Mourinho ally, understood to be Rui Faria — a renowned wind-up merchant — 10 minutes before the interval.

Didier Drogba went down holding his head following an aerial duel with Ciaran Clark, prompting an exchange of words in the technical areas. Lambert removed his coat as if ready for action.

Afterwards, Mourinho appeared to criticise Lambert by suggesting Villa should not be struggling near the bottom of the table.

‘If they go down it is not because of the quality of their players,’ said Mourinho. ‘I believe they are not going down. This is a big club.’

Asked if it would be Lambert’s fault if Villa dropped a division, Mourinho replied: ‘I am saying nothing. I am saying that’s football. They have more than enough.’

The pair clashed earlier this season when Mourinho tried to shake Lambert’s hand before full-time in Chelsea’s 3-0 win at Stamford Bridge. 

Mourinho had tongue wedged in cheek when saying Lambert and his then assistant Roy Keane were ‘very polite and well-educated people’.

Lambert seemed surprised at any praise coming from the Portuguese. ‘Whether he is trying to put pressure on me, I don’t know,’ said the Scot. 

‘Was it genuine? We’ll call it genuine-ish. I would love to learn from him as a manager but I wouldn’t like to learn things off the pitch from someone in his dug-out.’

Lambert must switch his focus to more important matters. Villa travel to Hull on Tuesday for a game of great significance. 

Jores Okore, who scored Villa’s first Premier League goal in 11 hours, said only victory would do. ‘It’s a really big game against a team who are close to us,’ he said. ‘Those are the matches you need to win.’

Eden Hazard and Branislav Ivanovic scored the goals against Villa that increased Chelsea’s lead over City. 

Mourinho called the Serbian one of the club’s best signings and his winner a half-volley to make ‘every striker in the world proud’.
