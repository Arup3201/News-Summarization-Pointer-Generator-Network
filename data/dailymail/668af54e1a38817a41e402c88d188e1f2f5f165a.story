With rugged knits made from Scottish wool and coats made in an artisan textiles factory in Manchester, the cosy new collection from Marks & Spencer has a distinctly British feel.

Unveiled here in an exclusive set of photos, the classic coats and wearable dresses are the latest to emerge from the fashionable brain of style director, Belinda Earl, and reveal a new focus on traditional materials after years of polycotton and pleather.

Drawing on heritage pieces from the M&S archive, highlights include a flattering cotton blouse in a chic red and white print, and a pure wool pale grey duffle coat.

Stylish: The new Best of British collection includes coats made in Manchester and plenty of Scottish wool

Highlights: Top pieces include this £59 crimson dress (left) and the traditional herringbone tweed coat, £299

Others likely to prove popular include a simple navy wool jumper and an on-trend 60s shift dress crafted from scarlet wool.

The collection, which launches on the 28th August, is the latest weapon unleashed by the high street brand in a bid to boost flagging sales figures.

Despite the success of last autumn's pink duster coat, which will be reissued this year in a rainbow of hues, M&S has struggled to compete with cheap and cheerful brands such as Primark and New Look.

Damp squib collections for Per Una haven't helped and have allowed Next, which specialises in stylish, middle-of-the-road pieces, to pull ahead.

Even the much vaunted 'Leading Ladies' campaign starring Helen Mirren, Tracey Emin and Grace Coddington failed to make much of an impact.

Cosy: A royal blue wool coat made in Manchester costs £299 while the cotton shirt beneath comes in at £89

But the fourth Best of British collection could transform the fortunes of the brand, thanks to wearable pieces designed to inspire its core audience, while also enthusing new shoppers.

Along with Scottish wool and Mancunian coats, the 54-piece range, which starts at £59, also includes chic pale leather brogues made by a family-run firm in Northampton.

Traditional fabrics such as herringbone and jacquard dominate, with the latter turned into wearable cocktail dresses that would do sterling service on chilly autumn nights.

'Since 2013 Marks & Spencer has been 
the lead partner of the British Fashion Council’s Positive Fashion 
initiative, a bid to support and encourage positive change within the 
fashion industry,' commented a spokesman for the brand.

'The Best of British Collection is a commitment to this initiative, 
championing Great British style, design and manufacturing.'
