British racer Susie Wolff was involved in a crash on the first day of this week’s Barcelona test.

Wolff, who has been promoted to the role of Williams test driver for the 2015 season, completed 83 laps when she was caught up in an apparent collision with rookie Felipe Nasr at the Circuit de Catalunya.

Both drivers were left stranded in the gravel at Turn 5 as the session was immediately red-flagged.

Neither Wolff nor Nasr were hurt in the incident, although Nasr, the 22-year-old Brazilian, who is set to embark on his first season in the sport, appeared to bear the brunt of the incident with his Sauber missing its rear wing.

Both cars were taken back to the garage as the session soon got back underway.

Wolff, 32, was driving this season’s Williams – the FW37 – for the first time.

It comes as Wolff’s role is expanded this season as she bids to become the first female racer to compete in a grand prix since Lella Lombardi in 1976.

Wolff competed in the opening practice session at last year’s British and German Grands Prix, but remains behind Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas in the Williams’ pecking order.

Earlier, Lewis Hamilton withdrew from testing after he completed just an hour of testing.

The F1 champion completed 11 laps before he stopped through illness. Mercedes are hopeful he will return to the cockpit as planned on Saturday, with Nico Rosberg resuming testing duties tomorrow.
