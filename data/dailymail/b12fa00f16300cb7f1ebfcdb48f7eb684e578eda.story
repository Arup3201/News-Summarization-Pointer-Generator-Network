Shane Watson has been named in Australia's squad for the T20 series against South Africa as he continues his comeback from injury.

The 33-year-old all-rounder has not played for the national team since the World Twenty20 in April, but returned to club action for Sutherland on Sunday after ankle and calf injuries resulting from stepping on a ball in training in May.

With the Test squad still in action against Pakistan when the T20 squad is due to gather ahead of the three-match series against the Proteas, there is room for a number of new faces, with Ben Dunk and Nathan Reardon getting their first calls.

Aaron Finch (c), Sean Abbott, Doug Bollinger, Cameron Boyce, Patrick Cummins, Ben Cutting), Ben Dunk (wk), James Faulkner, Nic Maddinson, Nathan Reardon, Kane Richardson, Shane Watson, Cameron White. 

There are also places for New South Wales youngsters Sean Abbott, Pat Cummins and Nic Maddinson, while the likes of Doug Bollinger and Cameron White add some experience.

James Faulkner has been named in the squad but his inclusion is subject to him being released from the Test squad in time.

National selector Rod Marsh said: 'While the 2016 ICC World Twenty20 seems a long time away, the nature of short T20 series at international level means every match between now and then is a great opportunity for players to show what they're capable of against high quality opposition.

'This series of three matches provides new captain Aaron Finch the opportunity to really work with the T20 squad after commencing his tenure as captain with a win against Pakistan in the one-off T20 a couple of weeks ago.

'The squad itself includes a good blend of youth and experience, providing Aaron with multiple options with both bat and ball. We've seen some good form in Matador One-Day Cup recently from players such as Cameron White, Nathan Reardon, Ben Dunk and Ben Cutting and they've been rewarded for those good performances.

'Shane Watson also returns from injury and we certainly know the destruction he is capable of causing in this format of the game.'

The series begins on November 5.
