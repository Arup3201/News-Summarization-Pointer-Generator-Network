An unfortunate ball boy was left winded and wincing after being struck in the groin by a Feliciano Lopez serve during the Spaniard's second-round match with Frenchman Adrian Mannarino at the Australian Open. 

Lopez had served at an estimated speed of 200km/h and the ball boy had no chance to move out of the way. 

Grimacing in pain the stunned ball boy spun around after being hit and briefly tried to walk it off. But he was soon down on one knee to get his breath back as a worried Lopez watched on. 

There was no way the ball boy could get out of the way of Feliciano Lopez's 200km/h serve 

The ball boy reacts too late and the ball spins away after it hits him in the tenderest of places

The umpire and players stood around the teenager giving words of encouragement, but they could do little to ease his pain. 

Minutes later he was forced from the court as an anxious Lopez walked along with him.

Ironically it wasn't the only retirement of the match as Lopez moved into the third round after Mannarino called it quits in the fourth set, despite leading two sets to one.

At least in the poor ball boy's case he probably had a much stronger reason not to play on.  

A worried Lopez of Spain can only look on and hope that the ball boy is OK after the incident
