Football fans heading to the Carling Cup final at Wembley have been hit by transport chaos today after a train derailed overnight.

Thousands of Liverpool fans have had to make last minute changes to their travel plans after the main line between Liverpool and London was blocked.

They were advised to alter their plans to watch their team take on Cardiff City in the cup clash this afternoon after Virgin Trains confirmed an engineering train derailed at Winsford, in Cheshire.

Chaos: Football fans trying to get to Wembley Stadium for today's Carling Cup final clash have been forced to make last ditch plans to get to London after a train derailed

Issuing an apology, the operator recommended those travelling to London consider driving to Crewe, Stafford or Stoke stations and taking the train from there.

Steven
Knight from Virgin Trains said: 'Today is an extremely busy day for us 
out of Liverpool and we have an army of people out this morning doing 
everything they possibly can.

'We
are at the moment attempting to get coaches to Liverpool and Runcorn so
they can provide a shuttle service to Crewe and connect with our train 
services to London.

'My 
advice to anyone intending to drive into Liverpool or Runcorn to get the
train, if they are able to drive to Crewe, Stoke-on-Trent of Stafford 
stations then they can use the train services from there.'

Apology: A Virgin train derailed in Winsford, Cheshire, overnight forcing the company to apologise to Liverpool football fans who have been forced to find alternative routes to Wembley

'Due to the derailment of an engineering train at Winsford overnight, the line between Liverpool and Crewe and Warrington and Crewe is blocked.

'Coaches will also be provided to connect Liverpool and Crewe and Runcorn and Stafford.

'Virgin Trains apologises for the 
disruption and is doing everything it can to minimise the major 
disruption caused by the derailment.'

There was another blow for fans making their way to the game as London Midland confirmed that there trains are also affected by the derailment, with the Preston to Crewe route is also affected.

Fans looking forward to the big game, which is due to kick off at 4pm, have begun spreading the news of the delays on social networking sites.
