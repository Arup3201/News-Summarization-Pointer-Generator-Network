The man mauled by a great white shark this weekend at a popular southern California beach has finally opened up about the terrifying attack.

Steven
 Robles, 40, was bitten by the seven-foot beast around 9.30 
a.m. Saturday morning at Manhattan Beach while it was snagged on a fishing line, it panicked and bit the swimmer out of fear while trying to wriggle free.

'It came from the bottom of the water. It came up to the surface, it looked at me and attacked me right on the side of my chest,' Robles told KABC. 'That all happened within two seconds.'

'I saw the eyes of the shark as I was seeing it swim towards me,' he continued. 'It lunged at my chest, and it locked into my chest.'

Robles has been released from the hospital and is expected to make a full recovery.

He was 
reportedly with a group of 15 frequent swimmers who dive into the water 
every Saturday in popular spots from Hermosa to Manhattan Beach Pier, 
and who were training for an International Swim Meet.

Robles told reporters he punched the shark in the nose, which is a frequently recommended strategy when faced with an attack.

Robles credits the quick thinking, along with God's intervention, for his survival.

A religious man, he recently swam to raise money for his Hermosa Beach church.

The
 shark had reportedly been hooked by a fisherman, panicked and bit 
Robles in the ribs, back and right arm, causing multiple puncture 
wounds, police told Redondo Patch.

The fishermen didn't realize Robles had been bitten.

It
 was his fearful screams they laughed at, but the fishermen quickly 
clammed up when it dawned on them just how serious the situation had 
become.

Witnesses
 told the Los Angeles Times the shark had been on the fishing line for 
nearly an hour and panicked, leading to the attack.

He was in the water while part of a group training, the site said, and was still conscious when loaded into the ambulance.

More than half an hour prior to the attack, a fisherman hooked the beast, but set it loose when it attacked Robles, witnesses told Patch.

He was taken ashore by surfers while lifeguards urged people to get to the shore and helicopters soon began hovering over the beach.

A surfer in the water near the victim told the New York Daily News of the terrifying attack.

'There was blood everywhere and I realized that something had gotten him,' said Casey Fenwick. 'He was screaming the whole time and I understand why.

'I was just worried about getting this guy in and on the board so somebody could help.'

Video from the scene shows the bedlam that ensued as he was pulled to safety.

Two-miles of the beach were closed while authorities worked to move the shark into deeper water, said cops.

‘The deputies directed a lifeguard boat and a Redondo Beach Harbor Patrol boat to the shark,’ said a police statement. ‘A paddle boarder was directed away from the shark by the boat crews. 

‘After approximately 30 minutes, the boats were able to coax the shark out to deeper water and away from the pier.’

A witness told the Los Angeles Times people began screaming ‘white! white!’ for a great white shark.

‘It was a scary scream,’ said Aram Ozen. ‘It was kind of freaky. There was a lot people screaming back to shore.’

Another witness detailed the horror to Patch.

‘The shark was 6-7 feet. A fisherman who regularly tries to catch sharks had it on the line for 45 minutes,’ said Scot Valor. ‘The shark was panicking. The swimmer just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.’

The beach has since been reopened. The man’s is in stable condition at a local hospital.
