She stripped naked at the end of September during the AFL Grand Final - now Heather McCartney is set to release some of her racy photographs for every month of the year.

The 26-year-old caused a controversy when she took off her clothes and danced in front of thousands of supporters at the Melbourne Cricket Ground as Hawthorn were beating the Sydney Swans.

But the Scottish model, who lives on the Gold Coast, has been keeping herself busy while working on a cancer charity calendar for 2015, which is set to be released in November.

'It's close to home and everyone knows someone that has had cancer,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

McCartney, who is also an ambassador for Cancer Research, said all proceeds will split between two charities -  Cancer Research and the Leukaemia Foundation.

The former Playboy model was arrested last month after receiving complaints when she danced naked in full view of strangers as police arrived to arrest her.

But it was reported that she lashed out, kicking, punching and biting the officers as they tried to handcuff her and she was jailed overnight.

McCartney, who has over 250,000 fans on Facebook, was a last-minute guest with a friend in the corporate box at the Grand Final.

Shortly after the final siren, she took off her dress and performed a naked display of celebration, which she now admits was a big mistake after she woke up on the floor of a police cell.

'I just pretty much went up to the window, turned around, walked away and put it back on,' she said.

'People around me were in absolute shock.'

McCartney told Daily Mail Australia that she wanted to 'clear the air' that she was never fined $300 or convicted for police assault after her raunchy antics at the Grand Final.

The stripper turned model also added that the AFL incident has given her a few extra modelling opportunities in the industry.

'Had talks with my agency about doing promotional work, sports events, V8s, horse racing and promotions,' she said.

'Still modelling bikini's for 'Wild Orchard' - had a bit of work with them for a couple of years.

'Few more shoots as a model and I have a big shoot coming up for FHM.'

McCartney, who blamed the free alcohol bar for her raunchy antics that shocked fans following Hawthorne's big win, says now things have started to finally calm down and get back to normal
