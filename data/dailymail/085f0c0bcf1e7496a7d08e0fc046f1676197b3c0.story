An armed robber jailed for carrying out a string of 100 raids to fund a Champagne lifestyle, robbed a succession of banks while on day release - and then tried to blame 'bankers greed' for the attacks.

Sean Bradish, 46, held up 
terrified cashiers and threatened to shoot them and their customers - while he was being 'reintegrated into society'.

He
 was being given ‘away days’ from Spring Hill jail a category ‘D’ prison 
in Aylesbury when he carried out repeated raids on banks and building societies - often within hours of walking 
through the prison gates, a court heard.

Armed robber Sean Bradish was jailed for carrying out a string of 100 raids to fund a champagne lifestyle. But he robbed a succession of banks while on day release - and then tried to blame 'bankers greed' the attacks

One cashier was robbed three times at the same branch and told Bradish ‘You’re kidding me’ when he appeared at her till again.

Bradish posed as a latter day Robin Hood telling staff: ‘You b*****ds are robbing the public.’

Judge Nicholas Cook demanded to know why 
prison authorities were not required to ask prisoners exactly what they 
were doing on their days out.

‘There will undoubtedly be public 
interest in such chilling offences carried out when the prisoner was on 
release from a life sentence,’ he said.

Bradish will now be sentenced at the Old Bailey tomorrow.

His first raid on the Lloyds TSB in Finchley Road on April 28 2012 was carried out four hours after he left prison.

Wearing a hooded jacket and balaclava he pointed a handgun at staff and grabbed £4,500 shouting: ‘Give me all the money.’

Bradish arrived back at the prison late - but was allowed to continue his day release scheme.

On
 May 12 he was back at the same bank and robbed cashier Piera Ventouroli
 for the first time, escaping with £4,000 after pointing the gun at 
customers.

For his third raid on July 20 he was at Lloyds TSB in 
Kingsbury Road and made off with £8,500 after warning: ‘If you don’t 
give me the money I’ll shoot the customers.

He also told a cashier: ‘You’re the b*****ds robbing the public.’

Ms Ventouroli was at the bank when he returned on September 28 and gasped:’You’re kidding me’ when he appeared at her till.

‘She could not believe she had been robbed again,’ said prosecutor James Lofthouse.

Bradish ‘strolled’ out with £8,500

He was back at the back on February 8 last year and robbed Ms Ventouroli for the third time.

This time she could only say ‘Oh no, oh no,’ as he entered the bank.

By this time he had been released from jail on licence and he used his son’s mountain bike to ride off.

Bradish tried to raid the Nat West Bank in Cricklewood Broadway on March 22.

He pulled a gun on a security guard, but he had just dropped his delivery of £25,000 into a delivery chute.

The guard said later: ’I felt lucky to be alive. I thought I was going to be shot.’

Bradish was forced to flee emply-handed even after he had pointed the gun at he head of a customer.

Three days later he raided Barclays Bank in Ickenham and escaped with £13,135.

He
 was being watched by the Flying Squad as he drove his partner’s 
Mercedes A6 to the back and burst in shouting: ‘I’ll shoot you, give me 
all your money.’

An elderly woman who was a regular customer at the bank was terrified as Bradish left the back scattering notes behind him.

Bradish was jailed in 2002 after he carried out at least 100 banks and building society jobs to fund a champagne lifestyle.

A decade ago Bradish led the feared ‘Bradish Boys’ gang with his brother Vincent, now 50.

They posed for pictures swigging bottles of champagne after threatening to shoot bank cashiers and staff.

Vincent was jailed 22 years for his part in the five year reign of terror.

The
 judge said Sean Bradish, who was then already serving a life sentence, 
should serve 13 years and five months before he was considered for 
parole.

The Bradish Boys also hit security vans and bingo halls, netting more than £500,000.

They spent the loot on cars, women and drugs

But their run came to a swift end when Steven Roberts, one their most loyal accomplices, was arrested.

He
 spent five days in the witness box describing the robberies in precise 
detail as the Bradish brothers scowled at him from the dock.

Sean 
Bradish was already serving a life sentence after he was caught 
preparing to rob a security van making a delivering to Royal National 
Institute for the Blind offices.

The brothers would wear balaclavas and surgical gloves to terrify cashiers with fully loaded pistols, revolvers and shotguns.

Sean loved to find customers in banks because he could threaten them to force cashiers to hand over money.

Throughout the raids his finger was on the trigger of his favourite sawn-off shotgun or pistol.

Bradish,
 who now has a full beard and glasses, admitted six robberies, one 
attempted robbery, and seven counts of possession of an imitation 
firearm with intent.

Bradish did not enter pleas to a further armed robbery and attempted robbery, charges that will lie on file.

He began his 100 raid spree on January 15, 1995 was when he 
and an accomplice struck at the London Electricity Board at Kilburn High
 Road.

On February 28, 1997 they grabbed £64,064 from the Thomas Cook
 travel agent in Wallington, Surrey and were covered in red dye when one
 of the booby-trapped wads of notes exploded.

On May 5, 1997 the brothers threatened to shoot a guard as they plundered £13,000 from a Tesco supermarket in Sutton.

The raid was captured on the CCTV and the film was used on the television programme ‘Britain’s Most Wanted.’

Officers from the Flying Squad mounted one of their biggest ever operations to nail the Bradish Brothers.

But
 the robbers so terrified cashiers when they returned to the Thomas Cook
 in Wallington that they were caught on CCTV tearfully hugging each 
other in relief after the robbers had gone.

After a raid at the HSBC 
in Coulsdon, Surrey, the trio fled with £5,527 and celebrated that night
 at the Holiday Inn at Sutton taking pictures of each other with 
champagne.

In October 2000 the gang were filmed by the Flying Squad preparing to rob the Co-op in Rose Hill, Sutton.

Roberts told the court: ‘The money was spent on cars, clothes, living in hotels, drink and drugs.’

He explained the gang managed to evade the police for years because they were so security conscious.

‘We would walk around. We would be looking everywhere,’ he said.

‘We would go round roundabouts three or four times before going up the way we came to see if there was anybody behind us.

‘It was to see if there was any Flying Squad there on motorbikes or in cars.

‘We knew what some of the bikes they used looked like.

‘We had spotted them so many times in different places. We spotted them three or four times a day.’

He
 added: ‘Before you do the target from the moment you leave the house 
and even after doing the target you are constantly watching everything 
around you.’

Normally firearms would be discarded after each job, Roberts said.

Sean
 Bradish, then of Kilburn, and Vincent Bradish, of Sutton, and Vincent, also of Sutton, were 
convicted by a jury of conspiracy to rob and conspiracy to possess 
firearms.

Sean was also convicted of specimen robberies on August 7 1996 and June 2 1998 and the related firearms charges.

Roberts was given eight years he admitted a series of robberies but had to be given a new identity in jail.

Bradish
 had been jailed in 1986 for five years after he raided the Woolwich 
Building Society in Kilburn High Street armed with a sawn-off shotgun.

When
 they were jailed the Bradish Boys were described by police as the most 
prolific and dangerous team of armed robbers London has seen in the 
recent past.
