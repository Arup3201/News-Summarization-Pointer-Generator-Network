Simon Cowell is asking Britain's Got Talent hopefuls to sign a gagging order which prevents them from talking about him or the show for life, it has been claimed.

All contestants, who are told to think carefully before signing the three page document, is allegedly so strict the hopefuls cannot even speak of its existence or even update their Facebook pages without Cowell's approval.

The Daily Mirror report an insider, who has seen the document, described it as 'highly unusual.'

Control: Simon Cowell's company Syco has an 'exhaustive' gagging order for contestants on BGT, it has been claimed

'Compared to other TV show contracts, the scare and sheer number of the confidentiality clauses is highly unusual', the source told the paper.

Contestants are 'gagged' from talking about judges  David Walliams, 41, and Amanda Holden, 42, as well as any happenings in the house in the document allegedly drafted up by Cowell's company Syco.

They also cannot mention anything about the audition process and it is alleged that bosses made sure each individual thinks very carefully about signing it.

Lifetime gag: Hopefuls are also reportedly banned from speaking about judges Alesha Dixon, David Walliams, Amanda Holden and Cowell

Another source told the paper: 'It must seem pretty draconian but contestants sign it when they get to latter stages.'

They added Syco could launch legal action against the wannabes if the order is broken.

Millions watch BGT every week as Cowell, and his trio of judges search for the UK's most unique act to perform at The Royal Variety Show later this year.

'Everyone
deserves a second chance': Cowell insisted he is right to let the acts 
audition, as the public can decide on the eventual winner of the show

In an early episode of the series, London's CEO Dancers, Ezinne Asinugo, 22, Soliat Bada, 23, and Nqobilé Ntshangase, 24, were given rave reviews.

But it appears it was not mentioned that they have toured with Afrobeats artist D’Banj and supported Labrinth and Rita Ora.

The trio has also made a dance workout DVD together and won the best dance act award at BEFFTA  - the Black Entertainment Film Fashion TV and Arts.

Act: The CEO Dancers, who appeared on BGT earlier this month, have toured with Rita Ora and won a prestigious award since 
they formed nearly three years ago

Established: The Pop'arazzi Crew have got through the semi-finals of the Dutch version of the show, it has emerged

Rivals Pop'arrazi Crew have built a successful career on TV in the Netherlands before appearing in ITV.

In a lengthy rant on Twitter on Sunday 
night, Cowell used the example of former BGT contestant Susan Boyle, who
has had a successful career off the back of the show, who had appeared 
on another television show years before.

The music mogul's comments came after it was revealed that The CEO 
Dancers, Francine Lewis and ‘sandwich makers’ Richard and Adam Johnson 
are among contestants who have toured the world or had successful 
careers spanning at least 15 years.

MailOnline has contacted Cowell for a comment.
