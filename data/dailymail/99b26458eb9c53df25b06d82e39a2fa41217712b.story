England manager Roy Hodgson said today that some professional footballers must be gay - but admitted he is yet to meet one.

England manager Roy Hodgson said today that some professional footballers must be gay - but admitted he is yet to meet one.

The 67-year-old said he was 'naive on the subject' of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) issues in football during a speech at the Cambridge University Union. 

Hodgson addressed hundreds of students on the issues of leadership, management and his own career.

In an interview with student newspaper The Tab before Wednesday night's talk the former Liverpool manager spoke about diversity in the game.

Hodgson said he had not met any players who have 'aroused' his 'suspicions'.

The manager, who had no idea what LGBT stood for, admitted he was 'naive' to the subject and said it was 'not his world'.

He said: 'I haven't come across any players who've found themselves in that position.

'I haven't come across any players who would even arouse my suspicion that they would like to come out but are fearful of doing so.

'It would be unrealistic, I guess, in football to not accept that there are a number of people who are gay because it covers every other walk of life.

'You really are talking to someone who's quite naive on the subject and who has not got strong opinions on it. I don't have an answer for you.'

Nottingham Forest and Norwich City striker Justin Fashanu remains the highest profile star to reveal he was gay, but he suffered years of abuse before he killed himself in 1998.

More recently the captain of the England women's team Casey Stoney announced she was gay after former Germany and Aston Villa midfielder Thomas Hitzlsperger recently came out.

The 32-year-old is now having twins with her football-playing girlfriend Megan Harris, who is carrying the babies.

Hodgson later told students that he felt out of his depth in the historic university but added: 'I'm not stupid, I read books and everything.'

After the talk student Will Nott said: 'He's an interesting and surprisingly funny guy, although some of his comments did make him appear a bit out-dated.'

The Cambridge Union Society, founded in 1815, is famed for inviting international politicians and academics to its regular debating sessions.

Previous speakers include the Dalai Lama, Winston Churchill, Ronald Reagan and actors Sir Ian McKellen and Clint Eastwood.

Hodgson dismissed his own playing days as 'not worth mentioning' and said the English media was not interested in his early successes as a manager in Sweden.

He described his spell in charge of United Arab Emirates as a 'a waste of time'.

The Arsenal defender Casey Stone said she has never hidden her sexuality in football circles because it is 'accepted'.

She told BBC Sport: 'I feel it's really important for me to speak out as a gay player because there are so many young people struggling with being gay'.

'You hear about people taking their own lives because they're homosexual, now that should never happen. They should never feel those pressures.

'How can I expect other people to come out and speak about themselves if I'm not willing to do that myself?

German football star Thomas Hitzlsperger said diver Tom Daley's acknowledgement that he was in a same-sex relationship helped him to come out publicly as gay in January.

The 32-year-old German international midfielder yesterday became the first Premier League star to reveal he was homosexual, saying that he had recently accepted that he 'preferred men'.

Hitzlsperger, who ended his playing career in September due to persistent injuries, said that other sportsmen's revelations about their sexual orientation, including those of Tom Daley, had made him feel that he was not alone.

The former Aston Villa, West Ham and Everton player said he had also felt empowered by Welsh rugby player Gareth Thomas, who publically announced he was gay in 2009, and John Amaechi, who became the first NBA (National Basketball Association) player to speak out about his homosexuality.

Hitzlsperger said that he was also encouraged by former Leeds United and US winger Robbie Rogers announced he was gay last year, and hoped that he too might be able to encourage other footballers to do the same.

'I read about John Amaechi, Gareth Thomas and Tom Daley,' Hitzlsperger told The Guardian newspaper.

'They weren't footballers but the fact that they went public gave me the feeling that I was not alone. I began to think that I could help other footballers who might be in the same shoes, so that they could see that here's someone who was even an international.'
