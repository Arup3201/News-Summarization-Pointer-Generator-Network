Former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard has told the Royal Commission into Trade Union Corruption of her anger at arriving home from holidays to find her bathroom had been demolished by her then boyfriend Bruce Wilson.

During four hours of testimony, Ms Gillard denied having any knowledge of an illegal 'slush fund' and having any role in setting up the account for the Australian Workers Union (AWU) Workplace Reform Association.

Ms Gillard was answering questions about the fund, the purchase and renovations of an Abbotsford property she owned in the 1990s, as well as the relationship she shared with Mr Wilson, an AWU official.

Former Prime Minister Julia Gillard has denied knowledge of an illegal slush fund from the 1990s before the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption on Wednesday 

Ms Gillard said she had no knowledge of the Australian Workers Union Workplace Reform Association fund until recent years and denied having any involvement in setting up their account

Counsel assisting, Jeremy Stoljar, SC, put to the woman who once held the highest office in the land, that she had been 'answering questions about these issues for many years, correct?"

'I most certainly have, Mr Stoljar,' she replied - only this time the grilling was under oath and not in the court of public opinion.

Mr Stoljar then homed in on how renovations at her property were paid for he, asking Ms Gillard 'were you annoyed that Mr Wilson had smashed up your bathroom?'

She replied 'it wasn’t my preference, no'

Mr Stoljar put to the ex-PM that it was likely that Mr Wilson had paid tradesmen working on her home in cash, without her knowledge. Ms Gillard refuted his claim.

'At the time of all of this, in 1995, I took steps to satisfy myself that looking at the amount of work that had been performed on my home, that I had paid for it all. That I had documents, receipts, invoices, that showed that I’d paid for it all,' she said, noting that it was a very stressful time in her life.

'I am sure that in our big wide world that there are tradespeople who take cash and don't issue receipts, it was my practice to pay by cheque.' 

Former PM Julia Gillard leaves the Royal Commission. Earlier she told counsel assisting that she might have done some things differently but 'none of us get to go in a time machine and go backwards. Obviously, if one got to do the whole thing again, you would do things differently given what I know now that I did not know at the time'

The former PM tendered four short separate statements ahead of proceedings. Her lengthy evidence was punctuated by some jolting exchanges with counsel assisting. 

When pressed by Mr Stoljar on whether she felt there was an issue with an the Workplace Reform Association (WRA) seeking incorporation under the Australian Workers Union (AWU) banner, Ms Gillard replied: 'None of us get to go in a time machine and go backwards. Obviously, if one got to do the whole thing again, you would do things differently given what I know now that I did not know at the time.'

The ex-PM admitted to providing legal advice regarding the establishment of WRA and assisting with the incorporation of the association, as well as providing free work.

'I provided legal advice, I then had no further contact with the work of the association or its workings.'

She defended her decision to provide free legal work for Mr Wilson, when providing advice and assisting with the incorporation of the Workplace Reform Association. The entity was allegedly used as a union slush fund in the early 1990s.

Ms Gillard did however concede, that in hindsight, she could have opened a file for the advice but did not agree it was a substantial task.

'Mr Stoljar, I can assure you that I did more substantial jobs than this for free for trade unions during my days at Slater and Gordon,' she said.

'Whilst this matter has come to assume a great deal of significance in the years since, at the time of these events and my provisions of advice, it had no particular significance. 

Ms Gillard (right) worked for law firm Slater and Gordon in the 1990s. 'I was just trying to do my best and give them the benefit of my professional expertise' she said of her work for WRA

'In terms of a busy legal practice it did not stand out amongst the many matters on which I advised.' 

Ms Gillard has maintained she did not have an ongoing advisory role and when asked said there was no indication that the full name of the association, Australian Workers Union, Workplace Reform Association Inc., would mislead people or cause confusion.

She also again denied having any knowledge of any WRA-related bank accounts, filling in forms or providing any detail for or writing an advertisement promoting the association in question.

When pressed on whether she might have provided advise for the advertisement in question, Ms Gillard fired back at Mr Stoljar: 'I'm giving evidence in a Royal Commission, I'm not prepared to guess.'

And she added: 'I was just trying to do my best and give them the benefit of my professional expertise.' 

At one point, Ms Gillard clearly became agitated with the line of questioning and dryly replied to a question regarding what her practice was in respect to dating a document.

'You put the right date on a document.'

When pressed on whether she might have provided advise for the advertisement in question, Ms Gillard fired back at Mr Stoljar: 'I'm giving evidence in a Royal Commission, I'm not prepared to guess.'

Ms Gillard often repeated that she was given no money by her former boyfriend, Mr Wilson, for the purchase of her house nor the renovations and despite their relationship, denied anything specific was discussed in relation to the setting up of the WRA account.

She also detailed how in 1995 she took steps to satisfy that works on her property were paid for, and in a legitimate way. 

The ex-PM said she should have opened a file on the advice she gave to the unions but did not see it as necessary at the time

'I worked hard... Mr Wilson worked hard... There would not have been times where we would have been sitting at my house while tradespeople were working,' she added.

Throughout the commission she maintained she knew no specific details about the fund and she and Mr Wilson did not discuss the specifics while at home.

Mr Stoljar asked: 'Did you ever wonder whether Mr Wilson had some other source of income?'

Ms Gillard said: 'There was nothing about his conduct which caused me to wonder.' 

But when she questioned him on it further down the track, Ms Gillard said Mr Wilson was 'evasive' about the topic and she suspected he knew more than he had told her.

This was during the time their relationship had already begun to break down. 

Ms Gillard has always denied allegations she knew that money from the fund was used to buy her house, and has publicly stated her belief that the fund was used for legitimate purposes.

The commission is part of the investigation into the Australia Workers Union, and is specifically looking at the fund called the Workplace Reform Association (WRA).

Witnesses at the commission have previously testified Mr Wilson gave Ms Gillard money from the slush fund to pay for renovations to her house.

In her statements presented to the Royal Commission, Ms Gillard said: 'I purchased 26 St Phillips Street, Abbotsford in May 1991. Over time, between 1993 and 1995, I had arious renovations done to the property. All payments made for renovations on my property were from my own money which was either derived from a loan from the bank and my salary.'

'Bruce Wilson was not paying for the renovations at St Phillips Street.

'To my knowledge, I never received monies that came from an account operated by (Bruce) Wilson and (Ralph) Blewitt.'

Earlier, a key witness in Robert Elliott, a former Heath Services Union industrial officer and national secretary issued a public apology to the former PM, in recanting parts of his written testimony.

Mr Elliott, described as a 'hostile witness' by the Commissioner, said he was embarrassed by his 'false memory'.

He stated to Neil Clelland, SC, representing Ms Gillard that he was suffering "acute embarrassment' and wanted to express 'my apologies to your client for causing her any distress and discomfort, that would be mortifying to me and I am very apologetic that it has made its way into the public domain.'

Bruce Wilson fronted the commission earlier this year and said he had no conversations with Ms Gillard about the way the WRA funds would be used.

On Tuesday, a former colleague of Ms Gillard's from Slater and Gordon Justice Bernard Murphy, told the commission despite hearing rumours in the mid-1990s about the slush fund he believed Ms Gillard was innocent.

Justice Murphy - now a federal court judge - said he believed the rumours were started by the former prime minister's enemies.
