Ruined future: Gurinder Ranshi, 23, was two years into a degree to become an optician when he was caught by police raiding a couple's home with a masked gang

A university student is starting a jail sentence after he ‘threw away’ his bright future by taking part in a terrifying raid on a couple's home.

Former private schoolboy Gurinder Ranshi, 23, was two years into a degree course to become an optician when he joined an armed masked gang who burst into a house and robbed a couple.

One of the gang beat the man with a metal bar as his girlfriend watched in horror. Ranshi then helped another man ransack the house.

When police arrived at the house in Hyde, Greater Manchester, Ranshi tried to flee by leaping from an upstairs window, said prosecutor Adam Lodge. But he fractured his spine as he landed and was arrested.

Ranshi, a charity worker whose father Mita is an optician, had never been in trouble with police before.

He grew up in a sprawling detached home in Sale and was a pupil at William Hulme’s Grammar School before it scrapped its £7,400-a-year fees.

Ranshi, who is studying at the University of Bradford, was a talented schoolboy golfer who won a hat-trick of top junior trophies at Withington Golf Club.

He denied any wrongdoing and said he was forced to commit the burglary by other men. But a jury found him guilty of aggravated burglary after a trial at Manchester’s Minshull Street Crown Court.

Ranshi, who was wearing a brace to support his back, nodded to his family in the public gallery as he was jailed for seven-and-a-half years.

Judge Mushtaq Khokhar told Ranshi: 'I still find it difficult as to why you would become involved in something like this, with the parents you have.

'In the course of one night you have thrown away all that you have worked for in two years of university education.'

But the judge added: 'Home, for anyone, is the last refuge. Everyone should expect to feel safe in their own home.'

Two other men involved in the raid in 
January 2012 were also jailed. Joseph Duffy, 30, of Offerton, who 
attacked the householder while the others searched for cash, was jailed 
for seven years.

Sentencing: Ranshi was jailed for seven-and-a-half years at Manchester's Minshull Street Crown Court after being found guilty of aggravated burglary

He had earlier admitted aggravated burglary, possession of an offensive weapon and assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

Jonathan O’Connor, 25, of Middleton, was found guilty of aggravated burglary after a trial. He was jailed for nine years.

Ranshi claimed in court he was going with O’Connor and Duffy to their friend’s house on the night and did not know of the raid until he arrived.

His father Mita declined to comment on the case. But a neighbour said: 'They had everything, his family did everything for him and he never wanted for anything - perhaps that was the problem.

'You could not meet a nicer family. They will be devastated.'
