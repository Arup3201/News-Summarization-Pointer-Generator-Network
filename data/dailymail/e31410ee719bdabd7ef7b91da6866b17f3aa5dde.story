Fashion week undeniably serves up some bonkers styles but away from the vertiginous heels, unflattering cuts and ridiculous headwear often spotted on the runway, we women want clothes we can actually wear and feel good in - and that's exactly where Jasper Conran comes in.

As well as being a pleasure to chat to at the crack of dawn on a Saturday morning, Jasper really understands the female form and knows exactly how to show it off in all its glory.

'That is my thing, you know, creating flattering clothes,' he tells me backstage ahead of the show.

Jasper Conran's collection of autumnal shades presented an extremely wearable line

He achieved it last season via sexy slips, double faced cashmere and covetable coats so how will he be dressing us for SS15?

'Its a combination of body conscious and much easier and softer shapes,' he said of his fluid jerseys and light weight silk shirt dresses punctuated with painterly abstracts in navy and coffee.

And while we are more accustomed to Jasper's play-it-safe style, the designer has pulled out his paintbrush and experimented with a more artistic vibe this season.

Jasper says that the collection is inspired by artists but fused with a much more loose and wearable approach

Unlike many designers who have raised their hems for SS15 Jasper has gone for a longer length

'The collection is inspired by artists but fused with a much more loose, easy and wearable approach. It's sporty, summery and fresh,' he said.

Pigment blue was projected across a palette of mostly white, and grids, stripes and spheres emblazoned skinny knit tops and skirts.

Unlike a lot of designers, who have raised their hems for SS15, Jasper's conservative silhouettes fell below the knee and footwear was exclusively espadrilles in rusty brown, navy and chalk white.

'This collection is a departure for me; it's a softening up.'

And quite a departure it was at Somerset House today; one women will welcome with open arms come spring.
