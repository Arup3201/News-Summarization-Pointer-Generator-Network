The new Coldplay album has become the fastest-selling UK album of the year, after the band shunned Spotify and signed an exclusive deal with iTunes operator Apple.

Ghost Stories - which documents Chris Martin’s famous 'conscious uncoupling' from Gwyneth Paltrow - sold 106,000 copies in its first two days of release, in what has been hailed as a victory for Apple in the future of digital music.

According to experts, sales were boosted by Coldplay’s decision to withhold the record from streaming services such as Spotify, where music can be played for free.

Instead, Coldplay signed exclusively with the Apple-owned music download service, in a bid to increase the sales of full-price albums.

The band even debuted the album at a special iTunes concert in March, before allowing the service to stream the record for one week before its official release.

While individual singles have been made 
available on Spotify - and the entire album could appear on the service 
within the next four months - industry experts say the exclusive deal with Apple is likely to have helped sales, according to The Independent.

The album 
has also been released two months after Chris Martin famously announced he 
was 'consciously uncoupling' from his 41-year-old wife, around the time 
they went on a family holiday in the Bahamas - something which could 
have also had an impact.

Gwyneth 
and the Coldplay frontman, who have two children, told fans in March that they had come to the conclusion that 'while we love each 
other very much we will remain separate'.

Coldplay's
 decision to release the album through iTunes comes after Beyoncé sold a
 record 1m downloads in the first week after giving iTunes an exclusive 
release of her self-titled album last year.

The album is said to document the 'conscious uncoupling' of the Coldplay
 frontman and actress Gwyneth Paltrow, 41, which the pair announced in 
March

Although the interest in the couple's 'uncoupling' could be a factor behind the high sales, some say Coldplay's decision to withhold the album from streaming services such as Spotify are the reason for the impressive sales in the first two days of release

The Black Keys is another band which has opted to withhold its album from Spotify, amid criticism that the royalties the streaming service pays are low.

But despite the increasing trend for major artists to sign with iTunes, download sales are still in decline.

With Spotify now having 10m subscribers and 40m users, download sales fell 2.1 per cent last year.

And Ghost Stories’ opening day sales were still 15 per cent lower than the 
2011 record Mylo Xyloto - the last album to be released by Coldplay.

It means it is unlikely the latest Coldplay album, despite its early success, will match the 
464,471 copies which the X&Y album sold during its first week 
in 2005.

After the deal was struck, Spotify published a message to Coldplay fans saying: 'The artist or their representatives have decided not to release this album on Spotify. We are working on it and hope they will change their mind soon.'

Apple is expected to launch its own streaming service after it bought Beats Electronics - the headphones maker co-founded by Dr Dre - which had already begun signing up customers to a new programme.

But industry insiders said YouTube, which is owned by Google, still provides a huge challenge to both Apple and Spotify.

On YouTube, Ghost Stories - and most other albums - can be streamed for free with a minimum payments to copyright holders.
