Joe Hart has been released from England's squad to face Scotland on Tuesday - giving Fraser Forster a chance of playing for his country at his former club ground Celtic Park.

Three Lions boss Roy Hodgson revealed he was letting Hart miss the friendly in Glasgow after the Manchester City No 1 had helped England beat Slovenia 3-1 on Saturday.

Hodgson said: 'I was going to release Leighton Baines for the Scotland game but he got injured anyway.

'The other one is Joe Hart. He will go home and have a break because I have two other goalkeepers I can play.

'There is potential for me to change the team but it is not a question of sending the bulk of the squad home because it is an important game.'

Forster played for Celtic before a summer move to Southampton. The other keeper in Hodgson's squad is Ben Foster of West Brom.
