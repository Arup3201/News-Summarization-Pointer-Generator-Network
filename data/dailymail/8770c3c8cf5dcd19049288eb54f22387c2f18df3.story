ENGLAND (4-2-2-1-1)

Joe Hart - 6

Nearly spilled one into his own net, but made up for it with a good save from King.

John Stones - 6.5

Slotted in at right-back with little fuss. The Everton man delivered some useful crosses, too. 

Positive: John Stones slotted in at right-back with little fuss and could become a regular feature for England

Gary Cahill - 6.5

Will play a lead role in the spine of this new England era. But for one slip, did what was needed.

Phil Jones - 6.5

Played in a centre-back role that many believe is his best and didn't look out of place.

Commanding: Phil Jones (right) played at centre-back for England and looked quite assured in the position

Leighton Baines - 6

Comfortable display from the Everton left-back, but looked a little lethargic at times.

Jordan Henderson - 6.5

Seen as the heir to Steven Gerrard's box-to-box role but didn't take grip of the game like his mentor.

Competitive: Jordan Henderson (right) looked strong in midfield for England but he has to take control of games

Jack Wilshere - 6.5

Should be the heartbeat of this team for the next 10 years. A decent display.

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain - 6

Didn't see enough of the ball to have a desired impact. Pace still a threat though.

Pacey: Raheem Sterling was England's best player and won the penalty from which Wayne Rooney netted

Raheem Sterling - 7.5

Buzzed around like he owned the place. By far England's best player on the night.

Wayne Rooney - 6.5

The new England captain was too deep at times, but scored from the spot on his big evening.

Opportunity: England's best chance was missed by Daniel Sturridge in the first half against Norway at Wembley

Skipper: Wayne Rooney's first match as England captain saw him net the winner from the penalty spot

Daniel Sturridge - 6.5

Now established as his country's premier striker and the Liverpool man looked the part on Wednesday.

Substitutes: 

Delph (on for Chamberlain, 70) - 6

Good energy on his debut.

Milner (on for Wilshere, 70) - 6

Slotted into central midfield.

Impact: Arsenal's new signing Danny Welbeck (left) came off the bench to impress for England against Norway

Welbeck (on for Rooney, 70) - 6.5

Looked dangerous in attack.

Chambers (on for Stones, 81); Jagielka (Cahill, 84); Lambert (Sturridge, 89).

Subs not used: Forster, Rose,  Townsend.

Roy Hodgson - 6

Will be happy with the way some of his Young Lions played. Will expect better on Monday night, though.

Time to reflect: England manager Roy Hodgson (second left) will want to see more from his side on Monday

Norway (4-3-2-1)

Nyland 6; Elabdellaoui 5.5, Nordtveit 6, Forren 6, Linnes 5 (Flo 36, 6); Skjelbred 6.5 (Mohamed Elyounoussi 69), Johansen 6.5, Jenssen 6 (Pedersen 88); Daehli 6 (Konradsen 57), Tarik Elyounoussi 6 (Kamara 78); King 6 (Nielsen 77).

Subs: Jarstein, Semb Berge, Hagen, Samuelsen,  Tettey,  Hansen.

Per-Mathias Hogmo - 6 

Danger man: Per Ciljan Skjelbred (right) played reasonably well for Norway and looked a threat on the ball

Threat: Joshua King of Blackburn Rovers and Norway had a reasonable game and should have scored

Referee: Jorge Sousa (Portugal) - 6

Let the game flow. The match was played at a pre-season pace which helped the official.

In charge: Referee Jorge Sousa of Portugal controlled game reasonably well but it was played at a slow pace
