Arsenal continued their preparations for this weekend's Community Shield clash with Manchester City by holding an open training session for fans at the Emirates Stadium.

In attendance was new star signing Alexis Sanchez, but wantaway defender Thomas Vermaelen was absent with a reported hamstring injury as he looks to be edging closer to a move away from the club. 

The Arsenal captain has been linked with a summer move away from the club, after failing to gain a regular starting berth ahead of Laurent Koscielny or Per Mertesacker, with Manchester United and Barcelona reportedly both interested.
