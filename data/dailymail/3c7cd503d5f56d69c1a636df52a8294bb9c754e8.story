An angry mother who took on Disney over their failure to stock Star Wars figures for girls has won her battle to get Princess Leia toys in stores.

Natalie Wreyford of Walthamstow, north-east London, took to Twitter to vent her fury after discovering Disney Stores only sold figures of the male characters from the classic films.

Her comments spiralled into a huge online campaign that has this week seen Disney relent and agree and to add Princess Leia toys to its merchandise.

Campaign: Londoner Natalie Wreyford was shocked to discover that Disney Stores did not stock Princess Leia figures for her six-year-old daughter, Honor's, birthday party

The issue came to light after Ms Wreyford, 42, organised a Star Wars-themed birthday party for her six-year-old daughter Honor and four-year-old son, Seth.

While she found her local Disney store stocked figures of all the film's male characters, such as Luke Skywalker and Hans Solo, she could not find any Princess Leias.

Ms Wreyford told MailOnline: 'I was passing the store in Covent Garden and noticed they had a new Star Wars range out.

'They are fabulous dolls - they are large, interactive and speak quotes from the films.

'I wanted to get a doll for both my children, but none of them were of female characters - and certainly not Princess Leia, who was noticeably absent. 

'As soon as Seth opened his (doll), Honor said "I want a Leia one". I felt terrible.

'I knew she was going to say it. There was an anticipation that she was going to get one, but I knew I couldn't fulfill it.

'She was so excited, but when I had to tell her they don't do Princess Leia dolls, she was absolutely crushed. She burst into tears.'

Ms Wreyford said it was 'very tricky' explaining to her daughter why no female Star Wars characters were available.

'You
 don’t want to be having these conversations with your child when they 
are that young about why they have not included Princess Leia alongside 
all the male characters.

'It's really uncomfortable. We felt betrayed and shut out by Disney.'

She believes gender labelling could have a negative effect on children.

'On the Disney website, all the Star Wars toys are categorised and nearly all are for boys. I think Disney are a bit behind the times.

'They are making decisions about what girls and boys like and don't allow the children to decide for themselves.

'It's self-fulfilling if Disney tells you something is not for you - it means you don't build it up as a passion.

'I'm worried it has an impact on what choices they make for themselves later in life and how they are perceived by other people.

When she tweeted the store to complain, 
she received the reply: 'Currently, there are no plans for Leia products
 at the Disney Store, Natalie. Have a wonderful day!'

The reply sparked a global online campaign using the hastag '#WeWantLeia' and a petition to have toys from the films aimed at girls stocked in the shops.

After weeks of pressure, Disney was forced into a U-turn this week and agreed to bring in the toys.

A Disney spokesman said: 'The current assortment of Star Wars products at the Disney Store launched earlier this year, and is just the beginning of what is to come.

'We're excited to be rolling out new products in the coming months, including several items that will feature Princess Leia, one of the most iconic characters in the Star Wars galaxy.'

Celebrating the news on Twitter, earlier this week, Ms Wreyford wrote: 'Thank you so much everyone who supported #WeWantLeia. We did it!!'

She thinks Disney may bring out the Leia dolls in time for Christmas.

'It's amazing. I was disheartened in the middle of it all, but my husband said at least people are talking about it,' she said.

Natalie Wreyford's crusade against Disney is not the first time children's toys have sparked a sexism row.

In November, Debenhams removed 'girls' and 'boys' signs from its toy departments following a sustained campaign from a parent-led action group.

Let Toys Be Toys, which campaigns against gender stereotyping, also scored a success two months earlier when Toys R Us agreed to drop similar labelling for its products.

Gendered toy signs have also been removed from major stores including Boots, Tesco, Sainsbury's, TK Maxx and Marks and Spencer.

Speaking after Debenhams announced the changes, Kerry Brennan, Let Toys Be Toys campaigner, said: 'This is a particularly important victory for me.

'It was heart-breaking shopping in Debenhams with my small daughter who chose toys from the "boys" section without realising.'
