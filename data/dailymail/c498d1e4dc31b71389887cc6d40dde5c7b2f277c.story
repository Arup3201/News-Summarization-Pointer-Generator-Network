The FBI has offered a reward of up to $20,000 as part of its search for a suspected kidnap victim whose 88-year-old husband was found beheaded at their $1m lake-front home

Russell Dermond’s decapitated body was found at their home last Tuesday and his wife of 62 years Shirley is still missing.

Investigators in Putnam County, Georgia are completely baffled by the gruesome crime and no one can understand why anyone would want to harm the beloved elderly couple.

Putnam County Sheriff Howard Sills has said Mrs Dermond's disappearance is being treated as an abduction.

The FBI has offered a reward of up to $20,000 as part of its search for suspected kidnap victim Shirley Dermond (left) whose 88-year-old husband Russell (right) was found beheaded at their $1m home last Tuesday.

According to CNN,
 Special Agent Stephen Emmett, of the FBI's Atlanta office, said 
yesterday the bureau will pay 'up to $20,000 for information leading to 
the location of Shirley Wilcox Dermond and/or the arrest of the 
individual(s) responsible for her disappearance.'

Nothing was taken from the couple's home and their car keys and cellphones were left behind.

Officers 
have been dredging a nearby lake and searching woods for clues, but as 
yet the local Sheriff says they have no leads. They still haven’t found 
88-year-old Mr Dermond’s severed head.

One
 of the Dermond’s three heartbroken children, Keith yesterday said the family had 
been trying to come up with a possible motive, but they say their 
parents didn’t have a single enemy in the world.

Speaking
 to MailOnline, Keith, 55, from Jacksonville, Florida, said: ‘We are 
completely devastated, but our primary focus is finding our mother. The 
thought of her suffering is just unbearable.

‘Each
 hour that goes by, my brother, my sister and me are becoming more 
resigned to the fact that we may never see her again and we may never 
know what happened.

‘If
 she is still alive, we can’t imagine what she is going through. The 
human spirit is incredibly strong… but it has almost got to the stage 
where we hope she is with our father, just to ease her suffering.

‘Whoever did this was so sick in the head that I just can’t imagine it.’

Russell Dermond was last seen on May 1 at a supermarket not far from his home in the gated Reynolds Plantation east of Atlanta.

Shirley
 Dermond had started the next day’s newspaper crossword puzzle, but no 
one had taken the couple’s May 3 mail out of their mailbox.  That same 
day, last Saturday, the Dermonds failed to show up at a friend’s 
Kentucky Derby party.

Putnam County Sheriff Howard Sills has said financial and phone records 
have not turned up anything to suggest the Dermonds would be the target 
of criminal activity.

Sheriff 
Sills has been forced to deny rumors that Mr Dermond – whose body was 
found in his garage - was in a witness protection program and may have 
been killed by mobsters.

He
 has also said there is no evidence that the brutal crime was in some 
way linked to the murder of the couple’s son Mark in a drug deal gone 
wrong in 2000.

Mark
 was gunned down in Atlanta as he apparently tried to buy crack cocaine 
on his birthday. Troy Major was convicted and sentenced to life 
imprisonment for murder.

He
 was also hit with consecutive terms of 20 years for aggravated assault 
and five years for possession of a firearm during the commission of a 
felony. He has tried to appeal twice, but both attempts were denied.
