An American student died after falling through the roof of an abandoned building while on a Spring Break trip to see Shakespeare in London.

Aaron Plowman, 24, from rural Soulsbyville, California, was with another student in the early hours of Friday morning when he climbed onto the warehouse roof which collapsed under the weight.

Mr Plowman, who was a senior English major at Montana State University was one of 14 students on a 10-day 'Shakespeare's England' trip led by an associate professor of English.

Tragic death: Montana State University student Aaron Plowman died after falling through the roof of an  abandoned building while on a Spring Break trip to see Shakespeare in London

London's Metropolitan Police described his death as 'accidental'.

Tracy Ellig, a spokesman for Montana State University, said: 'It just appears he was on his own, out having some fun. Unfortunately he made a decision that had a tragic consequence.

'It's an incredibly tragic accident and all of us at the university, our hearts go out to Aaron's friends and family.

'There was a lot of grief and sorrow and shock'.

The English Major student had written how he was excited to be going to see a performance of King Lear at London's National Theatre (pictured)

Plowman had been one of 14 students on the trip. He had written on the group's website how much he was looking forward to seeing a performance of King Lear at London's National Theatre on Wednesday.

He wrote: 'I'm going on the Shakespeare trip, because it is a great supplement to my Studies in Shakespeare class.

'I recently saw my first Shakespeare performance, so I'm excited to see some more. I'm most excited about King Lear.'

The students were also due to see a performance of 'War Horse' at the New London Theatre.
