Grace Dures, 14, was bitten in her shoulder during a school trip at Alton Towers theme park

Police are investigating after a girl of 14 was bitten in her shoulder in a Luis Suarez-style attack during a school trip.

Grace Dures was left crying in pain, with blood pouring down her back, after being assaulted at the Alton Towers theme park, Staffordshire, last week.

The youngster had been waiting for the park’s Nemesis Sub Terra ride to begin when she accidentally bumped into a middle-aged man.

Although Grace apologised immediately, he started swearing and, when the lights dimmed for the ride, she felt him sink his teeth into her right shoulder.

Grace, a pupil at Deyes High School, Maghull, Merseyside, broke down in tears and reported the assault to her teachers.

They took her for treatment at the park’s medical centre before reporting it to management.

Last night her father, Gary Dures, 45, said: ‘Grace has been left totally traumatised.

‘He has broken the skin and left a terrible bite mark on her shoulder. She was crying and there was blood pouring down her back. It’s really nasty and Grace has been left very upset and worried about it.

‘This whole thing about Luis Suarez has been in the papers and on everyone’s mind, it seems a bit of a coincidence that kids have started biting teachers in the playground and now this has happened to Grace. It’s just vicious and beyond me how an adult could do something like that to a child.’

The attack happened at around 4.30pm on Thursday as Grace and a friend waited for the Nemesis Sub Terra – one of the park’s newest rides – just before boarding the coach home.

Many of Grace’s friends had gone on the log flume, but she and another friend had decided they did not want to be wet on the journey, so opted to go on Nemesis Sub Terra instead.

The ride involves around 40 people being lowered into an underground cave with the unhatched egg of an alien creature. Actors usher riders into seats, which then free-fall 20ft.

Special effects and lighting then simulate the egg hatching and the creature attacking – much of which takes place in pitch darkness.

Police last night said they would be reviewing CCTV footage from the park to see if they could identify Grace’s attacker.

Mr Dures said he and his wife, Nicola, 40, were worried the bite could have left their daughter with a potentially harmful disease.

The couple, who have four children, have already taken Grace to see her GP, but she will have to undergo months of tests before she knows if she is in the clear.

‘We’re trying not to worry Grace too much because she has been so stressed out about it,’ Mr Dures added.

‘But she’s been to the doctor and has got to have all sorts of tests for hepatitis and HIV.

‘We just want this man caught so we can make sure he’s not a druggie or anything. To be bitten by someone you don’t know is one of the dirtiest things.

He left a really nasty bite mark on her shoulder. We’re just worried about the consequences.’

Uruguayan Luis Suarez was banned from football for four months after biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini on the shoulder during their World Cup match last month.

Luis Suarez was found to have bitten Italy's Giorgio Chiellini on the shoulder (left) during their World Cup game. Concerns have now been raised the striker's method of biting is being copied by others.

It was the third time the Liverpool FC striker had bitten another player during a match and lead to widespread condemnation.

Just hours later it was reported that a seven-year-old boy, from Lowestoft, Suffolk, had copied the Anfield idol by biting another pupil in the playground.

Impressionable Harvey Eaglen told teachers at Poplars Primary Community School that “professional footballers do it”.

Inspector Kevin Treacy, spokesman for Staffordshire police, confirmed the force had received a complaint and were investigating.

‘Officers will be reviewing CCTV evidence from the park to try and identify the offender,’ he added.

He is described as a white male aged 30 to 40-years-old.

Anyone with information should contact 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800555111, quoting incident 430.
