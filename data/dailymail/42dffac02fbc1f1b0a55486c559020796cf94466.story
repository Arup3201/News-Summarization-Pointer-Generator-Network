John Bercow ran up a £177 fare for a four-mile limousine trip, and the taxpayer picked up the bill.

The cost of the Commons Speaker's return journey from Parliament to Euston station in north London came to more than his rail fare to Lancaster and back.

The extraordinary bill emerged as Mr Bercow admitted to being 'bumptious and pompous'.

Mr Bercow has been repeatedly criticised for his jet-set lifestyle, embarking on globe-trotting trips funded by the taxpayer.

Since becoming Speaker he has enjoyed flights to Australia, Poland, Hungary, Slovenia, Greece, India, USA, South Africa, Finland, Denmark, Germany, Lithuania, Austria and Romania.

But he now faces criticism for a short trip across London, which cost more than 10 times the price of travelling on the Tube.

Latest figures show that Mr Bercow had his chauffeur-driven car take him from the Houses of Parliament to Euston station, and then picked up up and took him home at the end of the day. 

The four-mile round trip cost a total of £177, The Sun reported. The cost was higher than two train tickets, for Mr Bercow and an aide, to travel the 460-miles to Lancaster and back.

The standard class rail far came to only £154 compared to £177.49 for the car. Detaiuls of his expenses also show that he charged £193.64 for a 24-mile return trip to Bromley, South East London and an eight-mile journey to and from Battersea was £138.

Andy Silvester, of The TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'This is an outrageous waste. Why couldn't he have just hailed a black cab or, like most Londoners, jumped on the Tube?'   

A Commons spokesman said: 'Every effort is made to balance cost effectiveness and time efficiency.'

However, some MPs have accused Mr Bercow of becoming too grand in his role. Now he has admitted that it cold be true.  

His frank admission comes in the final episode of Inside The Commons, the BBC2 fly-on-the-wall documentary.

The programme, by respected political documentary maker Michael Cockerell, to be broadcast on Tuesday, focuses on Mr Bercow's stormy clashes with MPs in the Commons.

It also covers his reportedly fraught relationship with ex-Commons Clerk Sir Robert Rogers who quit last year after allegedly being told to 'f*** off' by the Speaker.

In this week's documentary, alongside clips of Mr Bercow berating misbehaving MPs, Mr Cockerell says: 'Many MPs say John Bercow is his own worst enemy because of his manner.'

The Speaker admits: 'Some critics say I'm bumptious and can be pompous. If people say that, there may be truth in it.'

He defends efforts to modernise the Commons, saying: 'It's not possible to make an omelette without breaking eggs.' 

But he admits he 'lost' his battle last year to replace Sir Robert with Australian parliamentary administrator Carol Mills amid protests she knew nothing about Commons procedure. 

Her appointment was blocked after a revolt by senior MPs.

Mr Bercow says: 'There will be people who say, 'the Speaker lost'. Well, that is undeniable. She has not been appointed.'
