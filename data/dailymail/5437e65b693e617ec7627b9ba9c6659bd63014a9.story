A politician who sued his rival for calling him 'Del Boy'  in a campaign leaflet is facing a £50,000 bill after dropping the lawsuit because he has 'developed thicker skin'. 

Neil McEvoy launched the legal action after Labour opponent Michael Michael distributed a circular which had his photo superimposed onto the face of the Only Fools and Horses character.

Plaid Cymru's Neil McEvoy, a former deputy leader of Cardiff City Council, claimed the leaflet implied that he was 'not to be trusted'.

But a top judge found it was not defamatory to compare someone to David Jason's on-screen character, instead labelling it 'the stuff of political disagreement'.

Mr McEvoy later withdrew his High Court libel case, saying he regretted bringing the action.

But he has now been ordered to pay £50,000 of his rival's legal costs.

Speaking after the case, Mr McEvoy said: 'With hindsight, I now regret having started this action.

'I have developed a thicker skin, and in future if I dislike something written about me I will write a leaflet of my own instead of issuing a writ.

'I don't think anyone has gained from this case going to court. This is the end of it, and it's time to move on.'

A judge ruled that comparing Mr McEvoy to David Jason's on-screen character was critical but not defamatory

The two councillors had become locked in a legal battle after the leaflet was distributed to around 2,000 homes in the Fairwater area of the Welsh capital.

Mr McEvoy, a member of Welsh party Plaid Cymru, had claimed the leaflet 'questioned my probity'.

His lawyer David Hughes had argued: 'We all know who Del Boy is - Del Trotter is best described as a "loveable rogue".

'The loveable element of Del Trotter's character comes from his good humour, his linguistic faux-pas, the amusing incidents that befall him, and the fact that he is fictional.

'The newsletters entirely eliminate any suggestion that Councillor McEvoy is in any way loveable. That leaves him being described as a rogue.

'He's not to be trusted. He's a rogue. Which of us would like to be compared to Del Boy?' 

Mr Michael had maintained it was a 'light-hearted' leaflet and that he was 'surprised' anyone was offended by its content. He said he had received feedback that people 'enjoyed' it.

His lawyer Hugh Tomlinson QC argued that the comparison would not have been taken literally by residents. 

High Court Judge Andrew Keyser QC, sitting at Cardiff Civil Justice Centre, said the leaflet implied that Mr McEvoy was a ‘money-loving and money-seeking entrepreneur' who was ‘prone to unrealistic fantasies and improbable business ideas’.

But he ruled that it was not unusual or defamatory to suggest that politicians' policies are fantasies, or lacking in realism.

He said: 'The picture and words do not mean the claimant is a roguish character.'

Mr McEvoy, who withdrew the case on legal advice, is covered by libel insurance.
