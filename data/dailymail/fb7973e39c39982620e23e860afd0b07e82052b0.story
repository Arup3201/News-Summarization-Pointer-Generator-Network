He's worked at five star restaurants and cooks for celebrities every weekend on the BBC's Saturday Kitchen but now James Martin has a different target market - dogs.

The chef has teamed up with vet and animal nutritionist Marc Abraham to create some canine cordon bleu for man's best friend.

And while the dishes, including sweet potato and white fish bake and cheese and kale frittata, might sound elaborate, the accompanying videos reveal that they can be prepared in minutes.

Canine cordon bleu: James Martin teamed up with vet and animal nutritionist Marc Abraham to create healthy meals for man's best friend

Easy: The cheese and kale frittata can be made in minutes by mixing up the ingredients on the right and then baking

As the ingredients are all ones humans can eat too, Marc points out that you could make the dish for your own dinner and share it with your canine companion.

James, who owns two dogs himself, said this is a much better alternative than giving your dog your leftover pizza or curry.

He said: 'Have you ever fed your dog leftover food? As if you have, you wouldn't be doing them ever favours whatsoever.'

Marc explains: 'It's very important that pet owners pay 
attention to their dog’s health needs, particularly with regards to 
nutrition. Owners may think they're being kind giving their dog 
leftovers, but this could have a detrimental impact on their pet's 
health if the wrong foods are given.

Clean plates all round: The taste testers loved the frittata

Treats: These muffins can be made so dogs can enjoy baked goods - never give them fruit or chocolate cake

'We have to give them the right food and exercise to stay healthy - it's simple, like with us.'

He added: 'Men are the worst culprits as they feed 
pizza and curry to their dogs, female dog owners are more likely to give
 casserole left overs with bread. That can contain onion which is toxin 
to dogs. Do some research and think carefully about what you feed them.'

As Marc and James whip up the meals in the 'K9 Kitchen', the vet also gives some tips on a dog's nutritional needs with some ideas on how changing their diet could enhance other areas of their lives. For instance, did you know that feeding a dog ginger biscuits could prevent them being car sick? Or that giving them pineapple could stop them eating their own dog muck?

The recipes include some ingredients that many people perhaps wouldn't consider giving to a dog such as the celebrity favourite food, kale, and the herb rosemary.

More please! The dogs loved the raspberry muffins

But Marc said kale is great for dogs because it's high in iron and fibre while he adds 'herbs are good for us and they are good for dogs too.'

But the pair point out in the video that there are some human foods that should never be given to dogs.

Raisins, grapes and chocolate are all toxin to them and can even be fatal.

As a result, they point out that fruit and chocolate cake should never be given to dogs. But if you have a passion for baking and want to share the fruits of your labour with your pet, then Marc recommends raspberry muffins made using flax meal, nutritional yeast and natural yoghurt.

Other recommended treats for dogs are cheese (in moderation) and carrot sticks.

While the recipes might seem a little overindulgent to create for dogs, they come with a serious message about pet health.

Despite being a nation of dog lovers, many Brits could be sending their pets to an early grave thanks to their diet. Processed dog foods have been found to be high in fat, sugar and salt which can cause obesity in dogs and lead to them being in general ill-health.

New research published by Direct Line Pet Insurance, who commissioned the K9 Kitchen videos,
 reveals that one in five pet owners worry about whether they are 
feeding their dogs the right things.

A
 third of those surveyed (31 per cent) were concerned about their dog's 
diet, 68 per cent of whom were worried their pets were not getting the 
right nutrition.

Edward Barclay, head of pet insurance at Direct Line, commented: 'We receive claims for so many cases of animals suffering from toxic ingestion. Dogs are very much an important member of the family, but foods that are a treat or even healthy to humans, can be very harmful, even lethal to our furry friends. Working with the James and Mark, we hope dog owners up and down the country cook and share these delicious recipes, without it ending in a trip to the vets.'

In the videos, Mark points out that the best indicator of your dog's health is their coat - which will be shiny and glossy if they have a good diet.

When it's raining cats and dogs would you like to be able to keep your pooch dry? Now you can as an umbrella for dogs has been invented.

The product, which costs £14.99 from PetShopBowl.co.uk, opens up so it faces down over the dog with an attachment to put on their collar. The owner then holds it over their pet using the handle.

Canine capers: Border collie Patch tests the dog umbrella

I put it to the test for Femail with my border collie, Patch. As he's a breed used to being active and outdoors, he's perhaps not the ideal candidate for the product. Patch doesn't care if he gets soaked when out for a walk, he just loves running around outside whatever the weather. But for selfish reasons, keeping him dry means less time spent towelling him off after a walk in the rain and avoids the house smelling of damp dog for hours.

No chasing squirrels today: The owner has to hold the umbrella over their pet as they walk

However, as you have to hold the umbrella over the dog, this isn't easy if you have one like Patch who just wants to run around chasing balls and squirrels. Not to mention how ridiculous you look in the process.

Perhaps the umbrella would suit rain and exercise adverse dogs who are happy to trot alongside their owners. It's also much better suited to smaller dogs like King Charles spaniel McNulty, pictured below, who can fit completely underneath it. But most will probably agree it's barking mad.
