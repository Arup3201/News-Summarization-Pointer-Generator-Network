Cyprus faced threats of economic oblivion yesterday as hopes of a Russian rescue for the debt-riddled island were put on ice.

With the country on the verge of bankruptcy, officials announced the banks would not reopen until next Tuesday while the country seeks a bailout.

But Germany and the European Central Bank told the country’s government that unless an agreement was reached, ‘there’s a danger that they won’t be able to open the banks again at all’.

The government is today expected to impose exchange controls to prevent money being taken out of the country.

But German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble raised the stakes with his warning that it needs to agree to a highly unpopular tax raid on bank deposits.

And ECB officials threatened to pull the plug on Cyprus unless it agrees to find £4.9billion to pay its debts and win an £8.5billion  bailout from the EU.

Its chief negotiator on Cyprus, Joerg Asmussen, said: ‘We can provide emergency liquidity only to solvent banks.’

Mr Schaeuble added: ‘The ECB has made it clear that without a reform programme for Cyprus the aid can’t continue.

Someone has to explain this to the Cypriots and I think there’s a danger that they won’t be able to open the banks again at all.’

Some 3,000 British servicemen have been told their savings will be safe but up to 60,000 other Britons on the island could be hit by the plans.

The Cypriot finance minister Michalis Sarris was in Moscow yesterday begging for help in a bid to avoid the spectre of the tax raid, which was rejected by the Cypriot Parliament on Tuesday.

Insiders say Russia may bail out Cyprus in exchange for the right to use military bases in Cyprus or for energy rights. ‘We will be here until some kind of agreement is reached,’ Mr Sarris said.

‘There were no offers, nothing concrete.’ 

Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev last night turned on Europe and accused EU countries of deliberately trying to wreck the Cypriot banking system for their own benefit.

Questioning the decision to close the banks in Cyprus, where Russians have stashed more than £30billion, he said: ‘It is likely that the goal was to destroy [the Cypriot banking system].’

He added: ‘It seems to me that every possible mistake that could have been made in this situation has already been made.’ Austrian Finance Minister Maria Fekter said the ECB was not ‘a bottomless pit’ that would fund Cyprus indefinitely.

Cypriot president Nicos Anastasiades will chair further crisis talks with parliamentary party leaders today.

One unlikely source of help did arise yesterday when the leader of the Orthodox Church in Cyprus, Archbishop Chrysostomos II, offered to put church assets at the government’s disposal.

He said the church had offered to mortgage its vast property holdings to buy government bonds. The church is the largest landowner on the island and also has stakes in a wide range of businesses, including in the country’s Hellenic Bank, with total assets estimated to run into tens of millions of euros.

Banking officials in Cyprus said ministers are expected to draft a bill to limit the amount of money leaving the country.

The ministers would also try to create a so-called ‘bad bank’, a fund in which to dump the non-performing investments of the country’s two largest banks, which lost billions on bad Greek debt.Another option under discussion is to nationalise pensions funds of semi-government corporations, which hold between two and three billion euros.

In Brussels, EU chiefs came under fire for their ‘bullying’ of Cyprus. UKIP MEP Roger Helmer told EU Presidents Jose Manuel Barroso and Herman Van Rompuy: ‘This is not a tax. This is EU theft by a fancy name.

‘I think gentlemen; the time has come to put your boots on for you are the grave-diggers of European democracy.’
