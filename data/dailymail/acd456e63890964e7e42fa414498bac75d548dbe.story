Paris St Germain striker Edinson Cavani has insisted he is happy at the club despite reports suggesting he had asked to leave this summer.

The 27-year-old Uruguayan moved to Paris from Napoli last summer in a huge deal worth a reported £55million, but was said to be unhappy at playing second fiddle to Zlatan Ibrahimovic in the French capital.

He has been linked with a number of clubs, including Manchester United, but has said he plans to remain with PSG.

Happy to stay: Edinson Cavani says he has no issues with Paris St Germain

'I am sure to stay, why would I not?' he told L'Equipe while with PSG in Beijing on Thursday morning.

'I'm well in Paris. I have a contract to honour. I'm calm, I'd rather be here. I feel good here. However, I know it does not depend solely on the player but also on the club.'

Cavani finished his first season as both a Ligue 1 champion and a Coupe de la Ligue winner. He scored both goals in the cup final, 2-1 win over Lyon, but throughout the season often found himself playing out wide - supposedly leading to his unhappiness at the club.

However, Cavani added that he had been reassured about his role in Laurent Blanc's side.

'There were some small issues about the position I wanted to play but I feel very good about that now,' he said.

'I waited for the right moment to speak. It is important for a striker to play in a position that is natural for him. Everyone knows my position and we do not need to talk about this.'
