Kate Winslet was yesterday labelled a ‘silly and irresponsible celebrity’ for apparently endorsing a campaign to legalise cannabis.

The Oscar-winning actress left herself wide open to criticism following an ill-judged decision to appear in a 17-second YouTube clip alongside Sir Richard Branson to promote Breaking the Taboo, a documentary made by his son Sam which supports decriminalising drugs.

Miss Winslet, 37, who is currently dating Sir Richard’s nephew Ned Rocknroll, does not appear in the documentary but features in the black-and-white promotional clip saying: ‘I’m Kate Winslet and I’m breaking the taboo.’

It is understood Miss Winslet got involved with the film because of her relationship with Mr Rocknroll.

More than a dozen stars, including Sting, historian Niall Ferguson and John Lennon’s widow Yoko Ono, listed as supporters of Breaking the Taboo, which calls on governments to ‘end the war on drugs’.

The campaign is run by the Beckley Foundation – the drug charity behind Channel 4’s recent Drugs Live: The Ecstasy Trial – in association with Sir Richard’s Virgin Unite foundation and his son Sam’s film company Sundog Pictures.

A source close to Miss Winslet, who won a Best Actress Oscar for her role in The Reader in 2008, said she was happy to promote the film and encourage debate but was not calling for the legalisation of drugs.

However, Mary Brett, of anti-cannabis campaign group Cannabis Skunk Sense (CanSS) described Miss Winslet’s actions as ‘completely irresponsible'.

She continued: 'She’s a role model for all sorts of young people. A lot of these celebrities jump on the bandwagon to be trendy and cool. It’s this message from celebrities going to kids that drugs are ok and they’re not.

‘She’s not a kid but a 30-something. I would hope she realises how silly she is.’

Kate Winslet, who was awarded a CBE for services to drama last month, has now been released from a list of supporters on the campaign's website

Miss Winslet’s name and photograph have been removed from a list of supporters on the campaign’s website.

The campaign is being run in conjunction with the film and suggests ‘solutions’ to the ‘war on drugs’, including proposals to ‘fully legalise and regulate the drug market’ and ‘decriminalise all drugs’.

It was later claimed Miss Winslet’s name had been included on the  website without her knowledge or permission.

Sources said the actress’s involvement ‘starts and ends with [the YouTube] gesture of support for the film’.

A source said: ‘There was a mistake, she shouldn’t have been on there. We’ve had her taken off.

‘She doesn’t support all the things on that list, she supports the film.

‘Kate got involved with the film because of her relationship with Sir Richard’s nephew, Ned. Kate does not, and never has, used drugs.

'Her support for the film is because she supports the film’s attempt to open the debate on alternative and more effective ways to end the misery that the drug trade causes.’

A spokesman for the Bransons admitted: ‘Kate Winslet has been supportive in joining the viral campaign for our documentary.

'Kate should only have been featured in the film/viral section, where [the video clip] now sits – this was rectified as soon as we realised the error.’

The debacle will be a source of embarrassment for Miss Winslet and her boyfriend of 15 months, Mr Rocknroll, 34, who works in marketing and ‘astronaut relations’ for Sir Richard’s Virgin Galactic, the company which plans to take the first tourists into space.

The couple met when Miss Winslet – who has a 12-year-old daughter,  Mia, from her first marriage to Jim Threapleton, and a son, Joe, eight, from her second marriage to Skyfall director Sam Mendes – was invited for a holiday on Sir Richard’s  private Caribbean island, Necker, in August last year.

In September this year, the couple set up home in a £2 million, 15th- Century house in West Sussex.

Last night a spokeswoman for Miss Winslet declined to comment.
