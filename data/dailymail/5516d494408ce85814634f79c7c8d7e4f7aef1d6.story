It is a quintessential New York City story.

While
 hundreds of thousands of oblivious commuters flit their way back and 
forth across the mighty steel frame of the Manhattan Bridge - homeless 
people are quietly burrowing into the girders and making it their home.

At least two squatters have managed to build 'coffin-sized living spaces' below the upper deck's car lanes, adjacent to the subway and above bike lanes. They are near to the entrance of the bridge, but far enough up the bike path to make accessing them precarious.

Dwelling: This is 'Joey's home - seen in daylight in the Manhattan Bridge

Each of the cramped homes are around ten feet-by-one-and-a-half feet and seem to be protected with bike locks.

The tiny, narrow dwellings are just big enough for one person to lie down, but they provide shelter for people who otherwise have to brave the elements. They do not provide much more.

The MailOnline attempted to contact either of the bridge-dwellers, 
but they did not respond.

The living spaces provide little silence as loud subway trains rumble by on four different tracks, 24 hours a day.

Cars and trucks also scream across the bridge almost non-stop, wind howls over the span - the city that never sleeps does it's best to keep the squatters awake.

Though hidden in plain sight, most people riding their bikes across the iconic span had idea the homes were there.

Not a single person asked by MailOnline knew of the micro living spaces when asked if they could spot them. Several expressed shock over their existence.

Precarious: The homes are perched in a narrow space between girders

Secret: His home is accessed by climbing over the steel railings to seen in the image and up and inside the girders

Not bothering anyone: Some enterprising vagrants are turning New York's Manhattan Bridge into a rent-free residence using only plywood and ingenuity

The spot they are located in is a rather dangerous, and is at a point in the bike path that is poorly lit and well-trafficked.

Bikers sped down the narrow pathway because people don't usually walk on it - there is a pedestrian walkway on the opposite side of the span. It is not meant to be walked.

The squatters likely picked this spot because it is part of a short expanse of the bike path where there is a roof. There is also no roof over the pedestrian walkway.

Not only is climbing the fence to the homes dangerous, but walking to them is putting one's life at risk, especially after the sun goes down.

The New York Post reports that one 
bridge-dweller, a middle-aged Chinese man, locks his plywood 'door' with
 a bicycle lock each morning and returns for the evening to sleep.

To reach the dwelling, which is built into the bridge frame on the Manhattan side of the bridge, he climbs a chain-link fence.

Poorly lit: There is no lighting in the homes, and there is also no silence

Metropolis: Hundreds of thousands of people commute by the makeshift home each day without realizing what is going on above their heads

Prime real estate: The dwellings are built into the upper deck of the bridge, below car traffic but above the subway

Last Sunday a cyclst saw the man climbing to his rustic nook and mistook him for a jumper, calling 911 to report what he thought was an impending suicide.

He was yanked off the fence by police and questioned, finally managing to convey in his limited English that he wasn't trying to jump, but was merely returning home.

The NYPD declined to comment to MailOnline regarding the dwellings, and the Department of Transportation has yet to return a message left seeking comment.

'People are really desperate for places to stay. I say, if he’s not bothering anybody, he’s not bothering me. Leave him alone,' Marcha Johnson, a passerby riding her bike near the shantytown told the Post.

Desperate and clever.
