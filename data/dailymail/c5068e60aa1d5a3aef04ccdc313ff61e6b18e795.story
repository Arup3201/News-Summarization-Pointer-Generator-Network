Tragedy: Ana Hernandez, 32, died in June in what are now described as suspicious circumstances

A teacher who is under investigation over his pregnant fiancée's sudden death is in hospital after collapsing in the street.

Darren Stott had apparently told his mother he was feeling suicidal over the decision to reopen the investigation into the death of Ana Hernandez, who was found to have taken a lethal cocktail of drugs.

Ms Hernandez, a lawyer, allegedly claimed that Stott was trying to poison her shortly before she was found dead at her Yorkshire home in June.

An inquest into her death was adjourned last week after her fiancé failed to attend and a coroner said his account of her final days contained 'glaring inconsistencies'.

On Sunday Stott, 42, collapsed in the
streets of Gran Canaria, in the Canary Islands where he now lives, and 
was believed to be in critical condition in hospital.

His
mother Carol told the Daily Telegraph he was 'very seriously ill and 
hasn't woken up yet' - adding that earlier that day he told her he had 
been having suicidal thoughts over the police investigation.

'He
is utterly devastated and had talked about taking his own life,' she 
said as she insisted that he had been planning to co-operate fully with 
investigators.

On 
Tuesday, as he lay in hospital, he was sacked from the school in San 
Agustin where he had been working as an English teacher after parents 
raised concerns about the suspicious nature of his 32-year-old fiancée's
death.

South Yorkshire
police have confirmed that they are re-investigating Ms Hernandez's 
death in the light of 'fresh information', but emphasised that no arrest
warrant has been issued for Stott.

A post-mortem examination of Ms 
Hernandez revealed a cocktail of drugs – none of which had been 
prescribed to her – in her system.

Tests also revealed the drugs may have been mixed into a spicy stew which she had eaten.

Police
initially concluded there was nothing suspicious about the death as she
had been given paracetamol for a headache despite her strong opposition
to the idea.

Friends and 
relatives of the Spaniard, who was four months pregnant, were stunned by
her sudden death as she was a fitness fanatic and vehemently opposed to
taking medication during pregnancy.

Her family insisted the staunch Roman Catholic would never have taken her life.

The
inquest heard that Stott, who lectured at Leeds Metropolitan 
University before moving to Spain this summer, met Miss Hernandez in the Canary Islands in April 2011.

She proposed to him on February 29 and moved in March to live with him in the village of Barnburgh, near Doncaster.

A statement from Mr Stott said said when she found out she was pregnant, ‘I was extremely happy and so was Ana’.

In early June the couple visited the home of local friends, Geoff and Carolyn Telford, for a drink.

Mr Telford said: ‘She told me, “Darren is trying to kill me. He’s trying to make me take drugs.” She wasn’t very happy.’

Mrs Telford said Miss Hernandez complained of a headache and said: ‘He’s trying to kill me with these drugs.’

The inquest was told Mr Stott travelled to Berkshire to attend a course on June 26.

His fiancée’s body was found two days later at their three-bedroom bungalow after Mr Stott asked the Telfords to check on her.

Pathologist Dr Kim Suvarna said ‘very high’ levels of paracetamol, tramadol, codeine and cyclizine  were found in her stomach.

Each
of the drugs on their own would have been enough to kill her. She had 
died after eating a highly-spiced stew and the pathologist said there 
was evidence to suggest the tablets could have been ground down.

The coroner has ordered further 
toxicology tests to shed more light on how she died.

The inquest heard 
tablets were found in every room in the house, all prescribed to Stott for a variety of ailments.

Coroner Nicola Mundy adjourned the 
inquest in Doncaster and said: ‘I am far from satisfied with what I have
heard. Very important matters have come out which need to be pursued.’

She said there were ‘glaring inconsistencies’ in Stott’s account.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
