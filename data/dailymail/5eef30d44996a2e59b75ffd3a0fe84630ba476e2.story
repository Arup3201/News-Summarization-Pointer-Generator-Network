This is the lavish $17 million estate that almost became the King of Pop's last home.

The jaw-dropping Primm Compound in Las Vegas, Nevada, caught the eye of Michael Jackson and boasts a star studded list of celebrity neighbours.

The luxury 10-acre compound includes the 15,000 square foot main house and is currently listed for sale with Sotheby's International Realty.

The impressive property is nestled among the homes of casino owner Phil Ruffin, the Sultan of Brunei and entertainer Wayne Newton.

It comes complete with its very own 'doggie villa', an indoor shooting range, working gas station and even a barber shop.

There is also a private equestrian centre, space for 20 cars in a showroom and lavish pool with waterfalls, a slide and spa.

The guest suite is in a secluded, or maybe difficult to find spot, tucked in the caves behind the waterfall.

The 15-year-old property was meticulously designed by casino mogul Gary Primm for his family, architect F.H. Laudenfrost and designer Hank Morgan.

Before his death in June 25, 2009, Jackson had set his sights on purchasing the home, which he planned to call 'Wonderland', after returning from his London tour.
