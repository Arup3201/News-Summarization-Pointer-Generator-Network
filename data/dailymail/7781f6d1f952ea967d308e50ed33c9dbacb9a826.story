Kim Kardashian has been on enough worst-dressed lists to fill a book, which is perhaps why her mother Kris Jenner, usually two steps behind her famous daughter, has escaped largely unscathed. 

The showbiz matriarch has repeatedly made crimes against fashion over the past few years. 

Misdemeanors on her rap sheet include double leather, double leopard (complete with pinstripe suit) and see-through trousers.

But while the mother-of-six's fashion choices have often been questionable since the early Noughties, Mrs Jenner has really got into her stride after hitting 55.

Since 2010, Kris's sartorial misses have regularly outweighed her hits.

Ripped white denim, ruffled shirts galore and mid-length leather coats have all featured in her daytime wardrobe. 

Most recently at Paris Fashion Week, she has been pictured in see-through trousers and Cruella De Vil fur coats.

While we applaud her efforts at originality, it is perhaps a wonder why she hasn't taken more notice of Kim, who sent her a blunt email in December last year that was leaked. 

After seeing a snap of her mother at a party in an outfit she disliked, Kim compiled a scathing critique.

'i love you mom but no more pilgrim adams [sic] family outfits,' wrote the 34-year-old.

And driving home her message Kim explained: 'you have exhausted this look

'done. move on

'we need chic, tights dresses not this omish [sic] s*** anymore.' It is thought Kim meant to type Amish.

But as the latest photos show, it seems Kris has paid little attention to her daughter's wishes. 

In celebration (and consternation) at some of the reality star's gung-ho attitude to clothes, FEMAIL looks back at Kris Jenner's working wardrobe:

In 1994, Kris made the brave choice of combined knitwear with sportswear. Although it may have been the most comfortable outfit ever worn by a woman in Hollywood, the style was questionable 

At the Ali Film premiere in 2001, Bruce and Kris decided to do the double; her in red velvet, him in leather

Bruce and Kris take Kris take Kendall and Kylie Jenner to the Holes film premiere in April, 2003. Kris couldn't resist a touch of Burberry check, despite the fact that it had been out of fashion for a couple of years

At the Along Came Polly premiere in 2004, Kris and Bruce once again matched their tops to their bottoms

Kris looked incredibly chic for the film Premiere of National Treasure in November, 2004

Kris glowed in a floral gown at the Emmy Awards in 2004

Kris shone once again in a floral dress at a charity dinner in July, 2006

While Brice stuck with his matching technique for a fashion show in March 2006, Kris went for a questionable checked coat complete with green fur trim and extra-long sleeves (although the man leaving the venue behind her still trumped with his suede suit) 

When Khloe Kardashian unveiled her new billboard for PETA in 2008, Kris went for boot-cut jeans, bug sunglasses and a pinstripe jacket

We're struggling to spot the mud at Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick's son Mason's 1st Birthday

Kris channelled the late Liberace for an episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians in 2011

Kris matched turquoise earrings with a figure-hugging leopard dress and black skyscraper heels at a Kardashian Kollection Launch Party in August 2011

Kris located the trousers for her pinstripe jacket (and added a leopard print tie and heels) to travel to rehearsals for Dancing With The Stars in September 2011

We'd have loved to see the needle that made this dress for Kris's All Things Kardashian book signing in November, 2011

Kris matched the backdrop at a Cody Simpson Album preview party in May 2012 

Kris wore a Matrix-inspired leather trenchcoat with leather trousers for a trip to New York in November 2013 

The leather trenchcoat had another outing in Feb 2014, with pirate boots, a ruffle shirt and red sunglasses

Kris must've been feeling all-white when she chose her clothes for a trip to the supermarket in April 2014 

Heading to the gym at the end of last year and Kris decided to wear this unflattering jumpsuit

In September Kris wore this outfit which might have been looked more in place on a school girl 

In September Kris wore these bizarre leather gloves and chunky ankle boots 

Heading out in Paris in January Kris looked like she'd just stepped out of the Matrix

Kris channeled Cruella De Vil for an appearance at the NTA's last week 

Kris will have felt the chill during Paris Fashion Week as she attended the Chanel show yesterday

Kris was inspired by Cruella again for a trip round Paris yesterday afternoon
