The family of brain-dead teen Jahi McMath have released videos which they say prove she's still alive.

In the two clips released on Friday, the 13-year-old is seen lying in her bed at a New Jersey hospital, moving on command. 

In one clip, her mother, Nailah Winkfield, asks her to move her leg and the girl's foot jerks in reaction. In the other clip, her mother asks her to move her arm, and the girl's hand grips an object before relaxing.

McMath's family have been fighting with the state of California ever since December, when the girl was declared brain-dead following a routine tonsil surgery at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital in Oakland, California.

Sign of life? The family of brain-dead teen Jahi McMath claim she's still alive, and have released video showing her moving on command. In the above screen grabs, the 13-year-old's foot is seen moving, after her mother, Nailah Winkfield, asks her to move her leg 

Tragic: Jahi McMath, 13, was declared brain dead last December following a routine tonsil surgery at a San Francisco, California hospital

Hold tight: In another video clip released by Jahi's family, the 13-year-old is seen gripping an object after being asked by her mother 

At the time, three doctors agreed she was legally dead and applied to turn off her life support machine. 

But McMath's family refused to accept the prognosis and eventually won an injunction preventing the hospital from switching off the ventilator, and transferred the teen to a undisclosed facility in New Jersey willing to keep her alive.

Now they're petitioning the court to reverse the death certificate, using the videos as evidence of Jahi's life. 

'I always knew cause I'm her mother, and I talk to Jahi, she responds so I said, "she can't be brain-dead if she's responding,"' her mother, Winkfield, said at a Friday press conference. 

Keeping her alive: The family won an injunction preventing the hospital switching off life support and agreed a 'protocol' with them in which the teenager could be transferred to another facility while on a ventilator.

Jahi McMath's relatives wants want the teen to be declared alive again so she can be moved back to her home state of California to receive treatment

The family's attorney, Christopher Dolan, says experts are wiling to testify that Jahi's MRI shows sign of some brain activity. 

'There's a difference between being brain-damaged and between being brain-dead,' Dolan said. 

The family will present their case in front of a California judge on October 9. 

If they win the case, and the death certificate is reversed, Jahi's family will be able to move her back to California where her care would be provided at state taxpayer's expense.  

However, Dolan insisted that the latest legal maneuver is not about money. 

Although he did acknowledge that 'she would be eligible for the same state benefits as every other person not brain dead on a ventilator, and who gets full medical care'.

Still, many experts are dubious of the new video evidence that Jahi is alive. 

David Magnus, director of the Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics and co-Chair of the Ethics Committee for the Stanford Health Center of Stanford University, says he hasn't seen the video but that it's common for brain-dead people to have random body movements.   

'There's no evidence that patients who are brain dead can ever recover,' Magnus told ABC 7. 'There is no recovery from death.'
