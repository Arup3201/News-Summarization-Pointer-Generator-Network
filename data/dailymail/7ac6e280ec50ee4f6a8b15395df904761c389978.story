If anyone knows a thing or two about making the vintage look work, it's Christina Hendricks. The Mad Men star single-handedly sparked the early Sixties bombshell trend when she first hit screens as Joan Holloway in 2007.

And it seems the actress, 37, has a penchant for decades past off-screen too, as she reveals in a new interview with Harpers Bazaar's YouTube show The Look.

She offers a glimpse of her favourite pieces from her wardrobe, and takes the crew on a tour of her favourite LA vintage stores.

How do I look? Christina Hendricks models one of her favourite vintage hats for Harper's Bazaar

Accessories appear to be her main addiction; she modelled a straw hat and jewelled capelet from her own closet, before trying on an array of costume jewellery.

In a second store, a hat boutique, she was more enthusiastic still, trying on countless hats, before selecting a wide-brimmed number to take home.

Wardrobe essential: The actress models an embellished capelet, that she says goes with everything

She issues words of wisdom in the process too, like: 'You've
got to lock down your fascinator,' and 'The secret to wearing a hat is 
that you have to commit to it. You've got to commit to these feathers.'

Christina, who is married to fellow actor Geoffrey Arend, is
certainly experienced enough to know. She reveals that she has been 
seeking out thrift store finds since the age of about ten.

'I lived in Twin Falls, Idaho, and there weren't a lot of shops,' she says. 'I learned very early 
on to go to the Salvation Army and just little vintage stores, and 
create my own looks. Oftentimes tragic...

Hat's entertainment! Christina had a ball in her favourite headwear store, trying on an array of designs

Titfer tat: The star looked fantastic in every piece, but chose a wide-brimmed number (right) as her favourite

'There were some very original looks that I put together. I had my goth phase, which was pretty... dramatic.'

Another source of knowledge and 
inspiration, has of course, been Mad Men. She credits the show's costume
designer, Janie Bryant, with steering her towards fitted silhouettes 
that flatter her curvy figure.

'I've
learned a lot from being on Mad Men actually, as far as tailoring, 
silhouettes and things like that,' she continues. 'Janie Bryant, our 
costume designer, she's taught me a lot.

Setting trends: Christina shot to fame as office bombshell Joan on Mad Men

Woven headpiece: 'This is one of my favourite hats (above). It's straw, but it's moulded. Cool, right? Very gypsy.

'The
nice thing about this hat, cause it's very formal, is that you could 
actually wear this to a dinner party and you don't have to take it off 
because it's part of the outfit.'

Embellished capelet: Christina says: 'This [capelet, above] is one thing that I find I wear often, and you would think that 
because it's so sort of specific thatÂ  you wouldn't.

'It's... one of my absolute favourite things because you 
can wear it with jeans and a T-shirt or you could wear it with a dress.

'It looks also very vintage as well, but it's actually new.'

'I think I have a lot more pencil skirts. I
used to like very sort of 1920s baggy, sort of floral lacy things that 
probably weren't the most flattering on me, but were just so gorgeous that I
wore them anyway.'

Among the items that Christina insists every woman must own is a metallic coat 'for the evening'.

Picking up one such garment in vintage store My Ulrika, she remarks: 'It's incredibly subtle.'

She admits having the money to spend on her wardrobe has certainly helped keep the fashion faux pas to a minimum.

She worked as a model between the ages of 18 and 27, living in London and New York, and could not afford to splash out on fashion.

'There were probably some really bad outfits then, because I didn't have any money to shop,' she said. 'I could only shop at Strawberry!

'I'd go back home where my family lives in Virginia, there was great vintage stuff there because a lot of people didn't 
want the stuff that I wanted, so I'd go and get that stuff and mix it in
with a little Strawberry tank top or something.'

One thing Christina does remember splashing out on was a pair of leather jeans.

'I remember saving up when I lived in New York,' she recalled.

'I wanted a pair of leather jeans so badly and there was some shop down 
on St Mark's... I think they were $200.

'That was a really big purchase 
for me. I saved up and saved up, and I wore them every single day.'
