A grandfather has helped answer the concerns of travellers across the globe by creating a portable lock which can secure almost any door in the world.

Bob Fitzjohn, 66, form London, developed The EasyLock device at his kitchen table after raising more than £10,000 from crowdfunding website, IndieGogo.

This device, which weighs less than an iPhone, will completely secure any type of door that opens inwards, anywhere on the globe, providing extra security for guests using hotels, B&Bs, or even beach huts.

It works by being fastened across the door's latchplate and hooking onto the outside of the doorframe. The lock is then secured in place with an adjustable handle.

It also allows users to open the door slightly to check a caller's identity and pass through slim items.

Mr Fitzjohn, an entrepreneur, said he spent hours drawing up the designs and making the prototypes at his kitchen table before setting up an online scheme to get money from members of the public to help him produce the invention.

He was appealing for £10,000, but eventually managed to secure almost £10,500 with donors praising the idea.

In return for their money, Mr Fitzjohn offered people a number of free EasyLocks depending on the amount they had pledged. 

One member of the public offered £2,500 in the early stages of the campaign with Mr Fitzjohn promising to send him 50 free EasyLocks once the invention had been finally produced.

The new product is being sold for £24.95, and is being advertised as 'the perfect gift for a travel lover'.

Mr Fitzjohn said: 'The design process took months of development and testing. I made a great many of sketches by hand and on the computer and I drove the family mad whilst I built functional lock after lock on the kitchen table.

'My thoughts were with my grandchildren when I designed The EasyLock. One day they'll be off travelling the world, and I wanted to create a solution that would keep them 100 per cent safe and sound, no matter where they stayed.

'My thinking in creating the lock developed into wanting to provide all others that may find themselves in a vulnerable position with complete security, whether a student in cheap lodgings, an isolated elderly person who fears living alone, or simply you or I when we stay in a B&B or hotel.'

Mr Fitzjohn said he persevered for more than a year in developing the lock, which now sells for £24.95

Bob Fitzjohn is glad that he has persevered for over a year in developing the lock.

'It is a dream come true that TheEasy Lock is now available for the public to purchase. My hope is that TheEasyLock will bring safety and peace of mind to many people, right across the globe.'

It is the latest security invention developed for travellers that has been widely praised.

Earlier this year a beach safety device called the Beach Vault was launched. 

Invented by holidaymaker Marcal DaCunha, the product is a unique locker that can screw into the sand and hold personal items such as purses, mobile phones, small tablets and money.

It can be sealed shut by a special waterproof lid to stop any liquid seeping inside, and then covered by a towel and pillowcase.

Whenever a sun-seeker is lying on the towel to relax, the 12ins-deep and 6ins-wide container is completely concealed.
