For every couple buying their first home together is momentous life event.

And with a price tag of £3.6million Euan and Suzanne Blair's new marital home in central London is more than a new couple could ever dream of.

But the new Mrs Blair is not the Mrs Blair listed on the property deeds.

Land Registry documents have revealed the six-bedroom Georgian town house in Marylebone is joint owned by Euan and his mother Cherie Blair.

Cherie was also the joint owner of her eldest son's former home, which was sold for £860,000 profit.

It implies the barrister retains a control over her son's finances, as she does for her other children Kathryn and Nicky, with whom she also jointly owns properties.

David Kirwan, of Kirwans Solicitors, told The Telegraph Suzanne Blair - the daughter of Jonathan Ashman, a motor racing entrepreneur, and the stepdaughter of TV weather presenter Sian Lloyd - would find it harder to claim a share of the value of the house, were her marriage to end in divorce.

He said:  'She would face an uphill 
task if the marriage ended, particularly if they hadn't been married for
 long,' he said.

'As a wife
 she would have some claim on the property, but it would be a much more 
litigious matter than if she was registered as joint owner, when there 
would be a presumption of a 50/50 split.

'It looks very much like a case of Tony and Cherie Blair managing their empire of assets.'

The couple dated for eight years before marrying in The South Pavilion, the £5.75 million Grade I-listed mansion in Buckinghamshire, owned by Tony and Cherie Blair.

Just days before they tied the knot, the 30-year-old, who is thought to be preparing a bid to become an MP, and his mother completed on the sale of the new property in Marylebone.

The impressive house boasts a master bedroom with en-suite bathroom, two further bathrooms and two reception rooms and is close to Regents Park.

The couple moved after selling their previous home, also in Marylebone. The four-storey property bought for £1.29million in 2010 was put on the market for £2.35million.

Three years later the house has been sold for £2.15million, netting the Blairs £860,000 in profit.

Euan and his mother paid £3,625,000 for the six-bedroom new house, a short walk from their previous home.

Cherie has interests in eight properties, with a total value of around £24million.

Euan recently moved from his job at investment bank Morgan Stanley, taking up a new post at Sarina Russo Job Access, a Coventry-based recruitment agency.

It was seen as an indication that Tony Blair's eldest son was preparing to run for MP.

However Labour has already selected its candidate for the Coventry North East seat, rumoured to be the 30-year-old's preferred target, leaving him with a six-year wait for the 2020 General Election, his first chance of becoming an MP for the constituency.
