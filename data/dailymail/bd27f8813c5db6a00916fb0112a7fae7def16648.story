It's the biggest night in the film calendar and actresses have spent months choosing their outfit and getting red carpet ready for the most important night of their career.

Yet designer Tom Ford has likened the Oscar red carpet to a 'global game show' and says he doesn't know an actress who isn't terrified at the prospect of the 'glam cam'.

Forget the fact that they're the most beautiful women in the world, primped, styled and dressed to perfection - he told WWD that running the gauntlet of the world's press leaves Hollywood's A-list women 'terrified'.`

Designer Tom Ford said actresses are 'terrified' of the red carpet, saying it's like a 'global game show'

He said: 'I do not know an actress who likes it.They're fearful of what's going to be in reviews that wouldn't have been there 25 years ago.

'They're fearful of the glam cam. It's like being on a global game show, and it's horrible. They're terrified.' 

'Ford, recently hosted a star-studded autumn/winter 2015 catwalk show in Los Angeles, with a front row groaning with celebrities including Scarlet Johansson, Beyonce and Jay Z, Gwyneth Paltrow and Amy Adams.

He typically dresses several men and one woman for the Oscars and was behind Gwyneth Paltrow's 2012 gown.

Now he's issued his advice on how Hollywood stars should cope with the world's spotlight.

The 53-year-old tells his starry friends: 'You're an actress. Play a part. You're in a movie now and you're a major actress stepping out on the red carpet and you're one of the most beautiful women in the world. 

'Just play the role. Get out of the car.'

Best actress favourite Julianne Moore was spotted in the front row of his show, prompting speculation the actress will wear Tom Ford to tonight's awards ceremony.

And when it comes to ultimate glamour, beauty and style, Ford - who also made his directorial debut with the much-lauded film A Single Man - keeps it simple, recommending women always go for a style that cinches the waist. 

He explained to WWD, that it's not an issue of weight or size but 'our standard of beauty'.
