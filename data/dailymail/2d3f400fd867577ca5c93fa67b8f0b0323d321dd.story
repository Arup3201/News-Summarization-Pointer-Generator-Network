Gentle Jess the springer spaniel gets ready for Easter down on the farm by looking after a family of newly hatched chicks.

Jess, 12, proudly carries the fluffy yellow bundles in an egg basket around the Devon farmyard where she lives, making sure they stay safe. And when one of them decides to go walkabout, Jess offers a warm paw for it to rest on.

Jess’s concern for the new arrivals came as no surprise to her owner Louise Moorhouse, who keeps sheep on the 180-acre farm near Exeter, as the dog also helps out with her new lambs, taking them bottles of milk.

Louise said: ‘She’s been helping out with the lambs since she was a puppy.’

At least Jess is one ray of sunshine over the Easter weekend: forecasters say the weather will be patchy and unsettled.

Much of the South is expected to be cloudy and cool today with some rain. Northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland are due to be dry.

Yesterday, sun-seekers flocked to Britain's beaches, rivers and parks and swept supermarket shelves clear of barbecues as the nation basked in warm bank holiday weather.

But today heavy rain will change all that with even thunderstorms expected to make Easter Sunday a washout.

Forecasters say the dry start to the 
Bank Holiday weekend which saw millions of cars emptying out of towns and cities on Britain's motorways will come to an abrupt end, with heavy showers sweeping across south east England this morning.

Making the most of it: Punters filled the River Cam in Cambridge today, but the weather is expected to turn tomorrow with showers and even thunder in the south

By this afternoon forecasters said rain and thunder may spread as far as central and south west England alongside parts of Wales.

It will be bad news to the thousands of people who raided supermarket shelves of disposable barbecues and charcoal yesterday as the bank holiday weekend got off to a promising start.

Sainsbury's predicted it would sell five times more barbecue products over the Easter weekend than on any weekend so far this year, with the chain expecting to shift 375,000 packs of burgers, 7,000 disposable barbecues and 56 tonnes of charcoal today alone.

The supermarket giant also claimed sales of coleslaw would be up 55 per cent, dips would rise 47 per cent and sausage rolls 49 per cent.

Rival giant Tesco also claimed it would see a barbecue boom, with 338 per cent more charcoal and wood sold than on this weekend last year and a nine-fold surge in garden products.

But supermarkets also admitted there would be plenty more traditional roasts which would remain safe and dry away from the rain.

Sainsbury's claimed sales of meat joints and champagne would double yesterday compared to last Saturday, while Asda boasted it would sell a million legs of lamb, 200,000 sides of beef and 200,000 pork joints.

Heavy 
showers and thunder are expected in places as rain spreads from the 
south east of England across central and southern areas and Wales by 
this afternoon.

It could mean a washout for many people planning 
outdoor Easter Sunday celebrations after most of the UK has enjoyed a 
recent spell of warm weather in April.

Scotland is forecast to have 
the best of the conditions for the rest of the long weekend, while the 
north of England and Northern Ireland are also expected to remain dry.

MeteoGroup forecaster Chris Burton said: 'It will stay dry 
and fine on Sunday across Scotland, Northern Ireland, northern England 
and the far north of Wales.

'But it's going downhill across southern areas of the country.

'There
 will be showers spreading northwards from the south east of England. It
 will be quite heavy across southern and central areas and we may see 
some thunder.

'On Monday, Scotland escapes the worst but it will be fairly cloudy across the rest of the country with showery outbreaks.

'Scotland is getting the best of the weather for the rest of the Bank Holiday weekend.'

Met Office forecasts say the north west of England and northern Scotland will be the warmest places to be today with a top temperature of 15C.

An
 estimated 3.4million people are taking a holiday in Britain this 
Easter, while about 1.6million are thought to be having an overseas 
break.

As well as those having trips involving at least an overnight 
stay, an estimated 6.5million Britons are likely to take day trips over
 the holiday.

Meanwhile a suspected drink-driver has been arrested after a car ploughed into a police patrol vehicle, injuring two officers.

The man, aged 44, was taken into custody at about 2.40am today after a Volkswagen Golf mounted the pavement and then struck the officers' car in Dudley, West Midlands. No one was seriously injured.

Chief Inspector Jack Hadley, of West Midlands Police, said: 'I want to remind everyone to think carefully before getting behind the wheel this weekend - there is absolutely no excuse for driving while drunk.

'If you're planning a night out over the bank holiday weekend, think about how you're going to get back and leave your car at home.'
