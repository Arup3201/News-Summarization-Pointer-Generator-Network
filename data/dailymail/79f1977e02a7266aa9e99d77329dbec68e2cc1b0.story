The Marine Corps helped rescue a Boy Scout troop that got lost while canoeing on the Colorado River.

According to the Yuma Sun, the 32-member troop in 16 canoes ended up stranded when they couldn't find their way out of an area of dense, tall reeds.

The group was reported missing late Saturday after they failed to check in at their destination.

Lost: A boy scout troop on a canoeing trip of the Colorado River were lost all day in an overgrown lake until Marine helicopter's led them back on a route to safety 

The Yuma County Sheriff's Office asked the Marine Corps Air Station Yuma for help when searchers couldn't locate the troop despite searching for over two hours.

Marine Capt. Wes Urquhart says his crew used night-vision goggles to spot the troop in a lake that connects to the river.

Urquhart says then was able to guide boats carrying sheriff's personnel to the vicinity, and those boats then escorted the canoes to a landing.

'The deputies said they knew the Scouts were lost and were east of the river somewhere,' Urquhart told the Yuma Sun.

'They had been searching but couldn't find them, so they requested aerial support, as it was getting dark.'

It only took the helicopter crew moments to find the troop after they put on their night vision goggles.

The troops were hidden behind tall reeds on an overgrown lake.

'They got themselves pretty deep into the estuaries and couldn't find their way back out. I can see how someone could easily get lost in there because those reeds are really tall,' Urquhart said.

'Finding them was actually the easiest part. They flashed us with some of their flashlights as well.'

After locating the troop, the crew hovered over a nearby ridge to let off Navy Corpsman Alexander Camacho to check on their medical condition.

'I wanted to make sure everyone was in good health and good condition and that there were no medical injuries that needed to be addressed,' Camacho said.

'Everybody said they were fine but just a little tired from being lost all day.'

While Camacho was doing his well-being check, Urquhart circled the area to find the best place for them to paddle back to the river.

'When we did find a path for them to leave, the estuary was pretty well enclosed,' Urquhart said.

'From the air it was obvious it was a throughway, but from the ground, they probably couldn't see that at all.'

Urquhart flew at a low altitude and dropped biodegradable sticks from the helicopter to the water to show them which way they needed to go.

Camacho said he stayed with them to keep them calm.

'Pretty much the whole time I was on the ground with them, it was just keeping them calm and making sure they stayed together,' Camacho said.

'I also instructed the scout masters to have one canoe in front of the group and one in back to make sure everyone got out safely.'

Urquhart then picked up Camacho and led the scouts through the reeds by using a spotlight to show where the deputy's boats were.

'It was a crew effort. It all went pretty smoothly,' Urquhart said.

'It was done just like we train.'

The Boy Scouts finally met up with the sheriff’s deputies who escorted them the rest of the way home while Urquhart and his crew made sure no one was left behind in the dark.
