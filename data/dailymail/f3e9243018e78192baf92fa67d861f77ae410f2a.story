A large crime scene has now been set up. 

Jeff Evans, who was trick-or-treating with his eight-year-old daughter nearby at the time said he heard squealing tires, looked over and saw the gruseome scene.

He told the O.C Register: 'When we got over here, there was already a tarp over two girls,' Evans said.

Response: Paramedics rushed to the crash site but two of the girls were pronounced dead at the scene while the third died while she was being taken to hospital 

Briana Magana, 13, said she attended Santiago Charter Middle School  with one of the victims.

She told the paper the pair had attended a school dance earlier in the day and had later gone for lunch at McDonald's. 

'It's unbelievable how something like this could happen,' Briana said. 'She always had a smile, she would light up the room, and she was just a really good student.'
