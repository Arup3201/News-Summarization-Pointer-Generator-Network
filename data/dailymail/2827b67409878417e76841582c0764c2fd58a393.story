A man who flipped off his dirtbike into some long grass soon stopped laughing when he realised what he’d landed on.

After his friend discovered him casually lying on his back with his hands behind his helmet, he was informed he was right on top of a deadly brown snake.

‘Don’t move, don’t move,’ his mate says when he spots the snake’s head poking out from beneath him.

YouTube user Gary John uploaded the video of the terrifying moment, that was captured at Hervey Range near Townsville in north-eastern Queensland, online. 

The dirtbiker was lying in some long grass after falling off his bike when he found out he'd landed on a brown snake

'Are you serious?,’ the crashed biker asks, his voice getting noticeably higher.

As his friend walks towards him and tries to stamp on a stick, he cries out ‘don’t do that’ and swearing ensues.

'It will bite me on the arse,’ he warns.

Trying not to rile the dangerous snake, his friend gets closer and asks 'you ready' and pulls him up from the ground.

Instantly the man leaps to his feet and as far away from where he landed as possible.

The common brown snake is considered the world's second most venomous land snake and is native to Australia, Papua New Guinea, and Indonesia. 

He had flipped off his orange bike but didn't think he was in any danger 

The deadly brown snake's head can just be seen in the video 

The video, filmed in north-eastern Queensland, captured the terrifying moment he realised what he was on top of

His friend reached out and quickly lifted him up after deciding it was the only course of action
