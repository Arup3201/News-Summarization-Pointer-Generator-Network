Targeted: Doctors at a Swedish eating disorders clinic say talent scouts from modelling agencies are targeting their patients (file picture)

Modelling agencies have been trying to recruit new talent outside Sweden's biggest eating disorders clinic, its doctors claim.

Dr Anna-Maria af Sandeberg said talent scouts were targeting her clinic, in Stockholm, because they know the girls there are 'very thin.'

She described the activity as 'repugnant' and said it sends the  'wrong signals when the girls are being treated for eating disorders.'

One of the patients approached was so ill she was in a wheelchair, Ms Sandeberg told Sweden's Metro newspaper.

The last incident occurred about a year ago she said, which forced the clinic to change its procedures regarding patients going on walks.

Many of the girls who were approached were still in their teens, she told the Metro.

According to its website the Stockholm Center for Eating Disorders offers treatment for out-patient, day-patient and in-patient services, as well as a mobile unit, a school and two apartments for family treatment.

It offers treatment for hundreds of patients of all ages, with focus on bringing 'starvation and binge-eating/vomiting under control.'

Some patients at the clinic have a body mass index - which measures a person's height to weight ratio - as low as 14, the Local reports, compared to a healthy BMI for adult women of between 18.5 and 24.9 on the scale.

Concerns have been raised worldwide over the influence of super-thin 'size zero' models who some experts claim are unhealthily thin.

Critics claim that images of these models should not appear in magazines and on TV programmes watched mainly by teenaged girls in case they try to starve themselves thin.

High street clothing firm River Island used a super thin model to launch a catalogue for a new collection last week.

It has also been revealed that some teenage girls obsessed with copying stick-thin celebrities are now starving themselves so they can achieve a so-called 'thigh gap'.

A
 worrying new trend has seen some young
 women becoming fixated upon legs so skinny they do not touch each other
 - emulating the thin frames of models such as Cara Delevingne and 
Eleanor 
Calder.

Admirers
 of the look - which demands legs so thin that they do not touch above 
the knees, have even created Twitter accounts dedicated to the pair's 'thigh 
gap'.

The fashion industry itself has long been criticised for using very 
skinny models, with the Spanish government actually legislating against
 the use of models with a Body Mass Index of under 18.
