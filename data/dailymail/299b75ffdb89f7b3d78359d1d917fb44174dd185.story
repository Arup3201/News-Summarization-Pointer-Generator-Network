Up to 35,000 Romanian and Bulgarian nationals could come to Britain next year, according to their ambassadors to the UK.

The British Government has repeatedly refused to put a figure on the likely influx from January 1 2014 when border controls must be abandoned.

Ministers say it is impossible to predict numbers and fear a repeat of the 2004 debacle when the influx from eight other Eastern European countries was grossly underestimated.

But yesterday the Bulgarian Ambassador Konstantin Dimitrov said he expected between eight and ten thousand of his countrymen would come in a single year, and said he regarded that as ‘no major influx’.

His Romanian counterpart, Ion Jinga, predicted between 15,000 and 25,000 Romanian arrivals.

The number is similar to predictions made by the respected MigrationWatch think tank which put forward a figure of around 50,000.

Sir Andrew Green, chairman of MigrationWatch said: ‘It’s significant that these ambassadors now recognise that it could be 35,000. That’s at the bottom of our own range but it suggests they are beginning to accept that the numbers could be significant.’

There are currently around 130,000 Romanian and Bulgarian nationals living in the UK. The ambassadors said their figures were rough estimates, and defended their nations’ contribution to the UK economy.

Work restrictions were imposed on the two countries when they joined the EU in 2007 but these must be abandoned next year - allowing all nationals of both countries full access to the UK labour market.

Analysis of a BBC Newsnight survey published on Monday suggested the numbers with concrete plans to move to Britain could top 100,000.

Speaking before the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, Mr Jinga said Romanian migrants were young, in good health and not interested in claiming benefits or healthcare.

‘There are more than 4,000 Romanian doctors and nurses in the British NHS, we’ve educated them in our system and they came to work here.

‘In fact we bring in more to your economy than we take out.’

Speaking to Newsnight on Tuesday, the Romanian Prime Minister admitted there was an issue with Romanian criminals in the UK.

Victor Ponta said: ‘I am very aware that Romanian citizens have committed, not serious crime, but some of them - Romanians but also representatives of the Roma minority - they are doing the small criminality, begging, stealing cellular phones.

‘I think that first of all we have to co-operate. Our police and law enforcement agencies should keep co-operating very well. On the other hand it is a huge challenge and a big concern for my government to implement the strategies for integration of the Roma communities.’
