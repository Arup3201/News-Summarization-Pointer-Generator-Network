A British father has made medical history by having his healthy prostate removed after discovering that he carries a defective gene that boosts his risk of cancer, it was reported last night.

The businessman’s increased risk of cancer through the BRCA2 gene is believed to  have come to light when he  took part in a trial at the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) in London.

He entered the trial because he has relatives who have suffered from breast or prostate cancer in the past.

The BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are known to be linked to an aggressive form of breast cancer.

Last week Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie revealed she had had surgery to remove both her breasts to reduce the risk of getting breast cancer after testing positive for the rogue BRCA1 gene.

In the latest case, the Briton, 53, who is married with children, asked to have his prostate removed so that he could avoid the fate of his relatives.

It is understood that doctors were initially reluctant to perform the operation as removal of the prostate leaves men infertile and can also result in incontinence.

It is believed there were no signs to suggest the man’s prostate was unhealthy.

Angelina Jolie chose to have a double mastectomy as her chance of developing breast cancer was very high

Roger Kirby, the surgeon who performed the procedure, told The Sunday Times: 'the relatively low level of cancerous cells we found in this man's prostate before the operation would these days not normally prompt immendiate surgery to remove the gland, but given what we do know about the nature of BRCA2, it was definitely the right thing to do for this patient.'

Following the surgery, a number of previously undetected BRCA cells were discovered.

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the UK, with over 40,000 new cases diagnosed every year.

Prostate cancer usually develops slowly, so there may be no signs you have prostate cancer for many years.

Symptoms often only become apparent when your prostate is large enough to affect the urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the penis).

When this happens, you may notice things like an increased need to urinate, straining while urinating and a feeling your bladder has not fully emptied.

However, these signs do not mean you have prostate cancer. It is more likely they are caused by something else, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (also known as BPH or prostate enlargement).

Experts say that knowing you are a carrier of the cells is difficult, and that they believe other men may now follow suit.

Prostate cancer affects one in eight men in the UK and there are 10,000 deaths each year.

Angelina Jolie announced earlier this week that she had a double mastectomy as she was a carrier of the BRCA1 gene.

The 37-year-old actress's decision was made all the more poignant by the fact that Angelina lost her mother Marcheline Bertrand to ovarian cancer when she was just 56.

She paid tribute to her husband Brad Pitt and family who supported her decision.

In an editorial piece in the New York Times entitled 'My Medical Choice', Angelina wrote: 'I am fortunate to have a partner, Brad Pitt, who is so loving and supportive.

'So to anyone who has a wife or girlfriend going through this, know that you are a very important part of the transition. Brad was at the Pink Lotus Breast Center, where I was treated, for every minute of the surgeries.

Following the operations, Angelina's risk of contracting breast cancer has now dropped to under five per cent.

She wrote: 'My doctors estimated that I had an 87 per cent risk of breast cancer and a 50 per cent risk of ovarian cancer, although the risk is different in the case of each woman.
