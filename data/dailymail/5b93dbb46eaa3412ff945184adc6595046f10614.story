A Colorado pastor denounced Disney's Frozen last week as a brainwashing tool for indoctrinating children into the clutches of homosexuality.

Pastor Kevin Swanson came out swinging in a Wednesday installment of his radio show in which he said the devil may very well have purchased Disney Corp sometime in the 1980s in order turn the adults of today into gay-supporting liberal sinners.

The religious talk show host also condemned Disney for its recent move to cut ties with Boys Scouts of America because of the group's anti-gay stance.

Tool of the devil: Pastor Kevin Swanson denounced Disney's Frozen on Wednesday as Satan's tool for indoctrinating young children into homosexuality in a radio show he hosts

'Friends, this is evil, just evil,' said Swanson. 'I wonder if people are thinking, "You know, I think this cute little movie is going to indoctrinate my 5-year-old to be a lesbian or treat homosexuality or bestiality in a light sort of way."'

Swanson didn't cite specific examples from the film that he says promote the 'gay agenda,' but he did take aim at Disney Corp in general, which he calls 'one of the most pro-homosexual organizations in the country.'

He also thinks Satan himself could be calling the shots from the boardroom.

'If I was the Devil, what would I do to 
really foul up an entire social system and do something really, really, 
really evil to 5- and 6- and 7-year-olds in Christian families around 
America,' Swanson wondered.

Let it go: Swanson is among a group of family values advocates who say the story of Frozen's misunderstood heroine is a gay coming out parable

In answer to his own question, Swanson declared: 'I would buy Disney in 1984, thatâ€™s what I would have done.'

It was that year when investors helped Disney Corp narrowly escape a hostile takeover by corporate raider Saul Steinberg.

Just this year, Disney chose to sever its ties with the Boy Scouts of America, reportedly for its stance against gay leaders.

'The Boy Scouts are the fault line,' said Swanson. 'You got Disney pulling funding. This is fracturing our society and I can see how it might, I can see how some parents might be very strong, they donâ€™t want their children indoctrinated in any way into the lifestyle of sodomy.'
