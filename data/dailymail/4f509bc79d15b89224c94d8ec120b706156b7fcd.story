A tourist has paid a parking fine – half a century after he left his Vespa in a no stopping zone.

American Robert Atherton rediscovered the penalty when he was going through papers from a holiday to Italy in 1964, when he was a high school student.

Alongside the usual keepsakes, he came across the charge which had never been paid, totalling 1,000 lire or about 57p. In today’s money it would cost about £8.

Robert Atherton found the 50-year-old penalty notice when he was going through papers from a holiday to Italy

He incurred it in the northern Italian town of Lerici in Liguria and it was to be paid within 15 days, the fine paperwork stipulated.

The honest tourist from Phoenix, Arizona, has now sent the authorities 50 US dollars to cover the fine and the interest accumulated over the last 50 years.

In a note with the money, he asked them to ‘please excuse his forgetfulness’.

The original fine was issued by the father in law of the current mayor of Lerici, who at the time was a young traffic policeman.

The American has not been punished for paying it more than 18,000 days late.

Mayor Marci Caluri said it was an ‘admirable’ gesture that others should follow.

‘I thank Mr Atherton for his honesty,’ he said. ‘It was an admirable gesture which I hope serves as an example to others. I won’t forget to write and thank him.’
