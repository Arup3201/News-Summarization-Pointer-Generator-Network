A model says her promising career was almost left in tatters when she was struck down with meningitis.

Holly Keating, 23, had enjoyed success as a lads' magazine model when she fell seriously ill with meningitis.

Confined to her bed for months, Miss Keating, from Dublin, Ireland, feared her dreams of a successful modelling career would remain just that.

Holly Keating, 23, feared she would lose her modelling career after she developed meningitis

Fortunately, she has now made a full recovery and says her career is now back on track.

Miss Keating said: 'When I got sick I really was terrified. When you hear the word meningitis you just panic, and you immediately think the worst.

'It felt like my brain was trying to push through my skull.

'I felt so weak and was being sick all the time, and to top it all off it felt like my career was being taken away from me.

'In the modelling industry if you're out of the game - even for a short time - people forget about you.

'You get passed over for jobs and eventually people don't remember your name.'

Miss Keating had to spend three days on a drip in hospital and then spent two months recovering at home

Miss Keating had the less serious viral form of meningitis. Bacterial meningitis is more serious

The first sign something was wrong was when Miss Keating began suffering from headaches.

She said: 'I'm never ill, so when I started to get heady at work I wondered what was going on.

'When I got home my temperature shot up and I was violently sick.

'It felt like someone had put a bicycle pump in my ear and was just pumping and pumping - the pressure in my head was horrendous.

There are two types of meningitis - bacterial and viral.

Viral meningitis is the less serious form.

Viral meningitis is sometimes mistaken for flu as the symptoms are often mild.

Meningitis is an infection of the protective membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord.

In adults, the symptoms include a severe headache, vomiting, fever, stiff neck, sensitivity to light, rapid breathing and a skin rash.

'I was so scared because I just had no idea what was wrong with me.

'Eventually I went to a medical centre where I was given Tamiflu and told that I had a strain of influenza.

'I took the medicine but it just didn't seem to be working.

'The next day I went down to A&E and at hospital I was finally diagnosed with viral meningitis.'

Miss Keating was hooked up to a drip and stayed in hospital for three days.

But for the following two months, the model was confined to a bed, with her career hanging in the balance.

She said: 'My career had really snowballed so to be struck down with something like this was very frustrating.

'If you're not available to work you just get passed up.

'I saw other girls in the papers and I knew that if I was well I'd have been in the pictures too.

'I was starting to get a name for myself and people in my home town were recognising me, but because I was sick I felt like it was just slipping away.

'I knew it could be the end of my career.

Miss Keating said: 'When I got sick I really was terrified. When you hear the word meningitis you just panic, and you immediately think the worst'

'It's only because I kept tweeting and Facebooking - and because I have great sponsors that stuck by me - that I didn't lose it all.

'Being that sick, and not being able to get myself out there, was just horrible.'

She added: 'The only thing I could do when I was ill was tweet and go on Facebook.

'But it's thanks to my presence on social media that I kept my name and my face out there.

'I'd post pictures and make sure people were still interested in my look.

Initially Miss Keating was misdiagnosed as having 'flu but the medication she was given failed to improve her symptoms so she went to hospital where the meningitis was diagnosed

'The thought that I could come back from this without a career was just awful.

'When
 I was finally ready to get back out there, it was slow at first - I'd 
lost a lot of weight and I didn't really feel like myself.

'But now it's really picked up and I'll hopefully be working a lot this year.

'I'm just relieved that I can keep doing what I love.'

Miss Keating said: 'My career had really snowballed so to be struck down with something like this was very frustrating. If you're not available to work you just get passed up'

Miss Keating has now made a full recovery and hopes to get lots of modelling work this year

Now, Miss Keating counts herself lucky for getting through the frightening ordeal.

She said: 'Something like this really does show you how you can be so healthy one day and so ill the next.

'It's made me so grateful to have my health and really appreciate what I do for a living.

'I had an amazing support system from friends and family, and now I'm just happy to back on my feet.'
