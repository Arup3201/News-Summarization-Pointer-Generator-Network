CNN anchor is causing a stir over his vulgar Twitter tirade against rival network Fox News.

Bill Weir, who joined CNN from ABC News last fall, lashed over over a Fox headline mocking climate change and former Vice President Al Gore.

The Fox story in question: 'Climate Doesn’t Cooperate With Al Gore’s Group’s Visit to Denver EPA Hearings.'

Weir responded on his CNN Twitter account Wednesday night: 'Weather is not climate, you willfully ignorant f***sticks.'

Lashing out: CNN anchor Bill Weir blasted Fox Nation over a headline poking fun at former Vice President Al Gore

Bill Weir joined CNN last fall after a long stint at ABC News. His comments about Fox News received support from many of his followers

Weir's comment got more than 830 retweets and received dozens of comments in agreement with the sentiment.

Despite, this, he issued an apology on Thursday afternoon: 'The glop of Midwestern guilt stuck in my chest prob won't go away until I apologize to @foxnation for name-calling. Dumb move. My bad.'

He did not, however, delete the tweet.

When one reader took him to task for using vulgar language he tweeted at her: 'Public school.'

The story, tweeted by Fox Nation, a Fox news site meant to be a forum for reader commentary.

The headline was stuck on a Washington Times story that was posted on the Fox Nation site that poke fun at Gore's Climate Reality Project.

Humble pie: Weir later apologized for his comments, saying he shouldn't have stooped to name-calling

The climate change evangelist's supporters showed up at Environmental Protection Agency hearings about power-plant emissions in Denver. They came armed with free ice cream in 'I'm Too Hot' relief trucks. The joke is: The temperature was just 58 degrees at the time.

CNN did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Weir's tweet.

Weir joined CNN last fall after spending much of his career at ABC News and Good Morning America.
