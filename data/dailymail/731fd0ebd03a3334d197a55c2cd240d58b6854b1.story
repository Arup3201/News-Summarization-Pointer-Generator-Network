Some people claim that French is romantic, but scientists claim to have identified the real language of love for online dating profiles.

The words that daters use to describe themselves in their online dating profiles can have a huge impact on attracting attention from the opposite sex, they said.

And now experts have identified the top ten enticing words with the ‘date factor’.

Text appeal: Women describing themselves as sweet, ambitious or thoughtful are more likely to attract male attention and receive admiring messages on online dating websites (illustrated), while men who claim they are physically fit or describe themselves as perceptive, passionate or optimistic prove more irresistible to women

A study of 12,000 online dating profiles posted on eHarmony.co.uk found that women describing themselves as sweet, ambitious or thoughtful are more likely to attract male attention and receive admiring messages.

Meanwhile, men who claim they are physically fit or describe themselves as perceptive, passionate or optimistic prove more irresistible to women.

It might be a cliché, but scientists found that both men and women are attracted to people who describe themselves as funny and both sexes ranked the word sixth in the top 10 list.

Physically fit or perceptive men attract between 60 and 70 per cent more interest from women who want to get to know them better, while sweet, ambitious or funny women see between 20 to 45 per cent more approaches.

The study also revealed that women are more likely to consider a man based on his description rather 
than his picture alone.

Words used on a profile were shown to have a larger impact on women’s decision to approach men at between 64 and 69 per cent, while men are slightly more biased towards a pretty face, with only 43 to 46 per cent being more swayed by words.

‘While the research shows certain words serve to grab fellow daters’ attention, at eHarmony we know that daters are looking for quality dates every time. And that takes more than just a few words; it’s about finding someone with the same values, who instantly gets you,’ Jemima Wade, spokesperson for eHarmony.co.uk said.

‘That’s why we worked with the University of Oxford to develop our Compatibility Matching System and employ scientists to keep refining and improving our algorithm to ensure it’s the best tool to help people find that extra special someone.’
