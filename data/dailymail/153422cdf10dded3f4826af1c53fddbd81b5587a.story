Once, to be 21 was to stand on the threshold of adulthood. In the words of the music hall song 21 Today, you got the key of the door and the chance to do just what you liked.

These days, for many, it barely has even symbolic significance. But to television producer Melanie Archer it’s a hugely important landmark – because the generation of children whose lives she started to document at the turn of the millennium – when they were seven – are now 21.

Tonight, in the documentary 21Up: New Generation (tonight and tomorrow at 10.35pm BBC1), she revisits her proteges to discover how their lives have changed now that they’re no longer teenagers.

All change: Ryan Sheridan is now working as a sports trainer despite battling with cerebral palsy

And the decency, humour and sheer determination she uncovers among today’s young people will be an inspiration, and perhaps a surprise, to many viewers.

She returns to catch up with youngsters such as Ryan, who despite his cerebral palsy is working as a sports trainer, and jazz singer Orala, a committed Christian who intends to remain a virgin until she marries.

‘It’s a wonderful thing to be involved in,’ says Melanie, ‘a huge privilege, and a huge commitment in a way that nothing else ever could be.’

She started work on the series in the late 90s after working as a researcher with veteran documentary maker Michael Apted.

His seminal programmes, returning every seven years to chart the lives of a group of 1960s schoolchildren, have now been running for half a century: in 2012, the latest installment, 56Up, was broadcast.

Tres bien: Alexandra Whitton is now studying in Paris and has a boyfriend who she sees every five weeks

Melanie was inspired to do the same for the 21st century, despite Michael’s warning: ‘It will become a much bigger part of your life than you could ever have imagined.’

She’s only now beginning to understand how true that is. ‘I feel a responsibility akin to being thir parent,’ she says, ‘even though we don’t experience day-to-day life with each other. They feel like my extended family.’

The 14 youngsters were picked from across the social spectrum. Some, like Alexandra and Oliver, come from wealthy families – both went to leading public schools and are now studying abroad.

Brimming with confidence, Alexandra announces, ‘For the next ten to 15 years I’ll be going crazy to accomplish my goals.’

She has a boyfriend, but he’s in London and she’s at university in Paris: they see each other about once every five weeks, and that’s how she likes it.

Gemma, a criminology student in Liverpool, takes a very different attitude to her life. Touching scenes with her boyfriend Charlie, including the moment when he helps her to cut her 21st birthday cake, show they are very much in love.

Gemma was left with limited mobility by a virus when she was two years old. Her disability has helped to make her confident and upfront with others.

‘If I’m open about my condition, people are more willing to help,’ she told me cheerfully this week. ‘If I’m not embarrassed, nobody else is.’

For an older generation, the intrusion of a camera crew and two days of intense personal questions from the filmmakers might seem an unwelcome invasion of privacy.

But these youngsters have grown up with their lives online, using Twitter and Facebook. ‘Nowadays everything is quite intrusive,’ Gemma points out.

‘It doesn’t bother me, I’m a very open person. But before you talk on camera, it’s important to decide what you want to keep personal and what you don’t mind other people knowing.’

Struggling with identity: Asif Lateef is trying to reconcile his religion with his love of pop music such as  Rihanna

That’s more difficult for participants such as Asif in Glasgow, whose family are observant Muslims. There’s a lot he wants to say, but he doesn’t want to offend his loved ones.

Though he’s still religious, he doesn’t want to attend mosque several times a day. He prefers to be with his friends, studying law and listening to music – he confesses that he’s a Rihanna fan, though his mother thinks pop music is a temptation devised by the devil.

Asif is coping bravely as he tries to shed the restrictions of his culture. ‘I felt I was a bit like a puppet as a kid,’ he says frankly.

Stacey is dealing with a different kind of culture shock. At 14 she lived in a Derbyshire village and had visited a city just once – ‘I didn’t like Manchester, it was too big!’

But now she’s on the other side of the world, teaching English to Chinese teens in Hunan province, and when she walks down the street people stop and stare – many have never seen a European woman before.

For Stacey, one catalyst of this massive change was the break-up of her parents’ marriage. She hasn’t heard from her father for two years. ‘I don’t think he cares,’ she says sadly.

Footballer: Sanchez Payne had signed for Leeds United but left after injuries. He is now looking for a new club

Professional footballer Sanchez is very close to his parents, and relies on them for support and encouragement in his career.

As a teenager he was a promising talent at Leeds United, but he’s suffered injury setbacks and is currently on the hunt for a new club.

Sanchez has an unusual perspective on the TV series – he’s looking forward to the 70Up edition, when he hopes to be able to sit down with his children and grandchildren so they can see what his life has been like. ‘It’s a massive project and I’m delighted to be a part of it – it’s priceless,’ he told me this week.

He too shares the sense that they’re part of an extended family – though it came as a shock to Melanie when he introduced her to a friend as ‘my second mum’. ‘I’d never thought of it in those terms,’ she says, ‘although I am the same age as his dad.’

Social media means that, although the 14 participants are now living as far apart as New York and China, they’re all able to maintain contact.

They met in London earlier this month for a premiere screening of the programme. ‘Ryan’s mum and mine hit it off, and now they’re going to do a charity run together,’ Sanchez says.

‘One of the other guys is into the same music as me, so we’re going to meet up. This show is a real blessing in my life.’

‘It’s weird to see how much we’ve grown up and changed,’ laughs Gemma. ‘But it’s really nice to share this thing together, and to have our lives documented. I’ll definitely want to continue with it in the future.’
