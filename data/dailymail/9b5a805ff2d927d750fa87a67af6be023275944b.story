The sobering reality of life in a city that was decimated by an earthquake that killed 185 people exactly four years ago has given England valuable perspective as they attempt to put their World Cup back on track against Scotland.

Christchurch is still in recovery, with signs of devastation still evident throughout a city centre that is barely recognisable to those members of the England party who were last here seven years ago.

Ian Bell has fond memories of his time here and hopes the staging of three World Cup matches at the picturesque Hagley Park Oval, culminating in England's must win game against the Scots, can help the recovery process.

'We were given a really interesting talk on what happened here and it puts a lot of things in perspective after the way we played against New Zealand,' said Bell. 'Having remembered Christchurch as a busy, sporting city it's amazing to come back to this.

'We started the tour here in 2008 and I remember being 12th man at the old rugby ground. To see some of the slides and pictures of what it looks like now was moving.

'To be here again and to see how they have been able to put sport back on is really nice. It was incredible to hear about it. The way everyone has got together moving forward and the role sport has played is something we can learn from.'

It was a welcome reminder on what really matters to a team who will be under enormous sporting pressure when they take on supposedly the weakest team in their group in a match that has taken on huge significance for England.

Bell not only wants to beat the Scots on Monday but beat them well to banish the memories of the total capitulation against Australia and New Zealand.

'It's about how we react now and we have to put in a good performance,' said England's senior batsman. 'The result is obviously the most important thing but it would be nice to win with real clinical cricket. We haven't produced anything like that in the opening two games. We've been well off the pace.

England have lost their opening two games of the World Cup and cannot afford to lose on Sunday 

'It would be nice to turn up here and put together the game we know we can. That's what we have to do. Even though what's happened up to now has been really bad it's irrelevant now. We have to turn up and play our best cricket.'

That means the senior players standing up as they did last summer when England were under pressure after losing the Lord's Test against India.

'It's important for the guys who have been through bad times and come through to speak to the group and make sure they are calm and ready for tomorrow. The senior guys have had a part to play in the last 48 hours.

'Certainly as far as I'm concerned if I can get us off to a good start with Moeen that will help us in putting in a good performance.

'The fact we have to apologise about our cricket is unacceptable. It's really disappointing what we've done but hopefully in the next four games we can put it right and start playing the cricket everyone knows we can.'

England were on Sunday considering making two changes to their embattled line up, bringing in Alex Hales for Gary Ballance and James Tredwell for Steven Finn.

Hales has been out of favour since India exposed a technical issue last year but may get the chance ahead of a batsman in Ballance who has looked badly out of touch since being brought in for Ravi Bopara on the eve of the tournament.

Mark Ramprakash, the England batting coach, has been impressed with the maturity, a problem in the past, Hales has shown here and says that he has been 'knocking hard' on the door. England may now open it and let him in.

Finn was smashed for 49 off just two overs by Brendon McCullum in Wellington and may now be taken out of the firing line in favour of the senior spinner in Tredwell who has struggled for opportunities since Moeen Ali's off-spin became a regular part of the England attack.
