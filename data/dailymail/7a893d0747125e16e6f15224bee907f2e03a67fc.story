THE only Hurricane that fought in the Battle of Britain and is still flying today is up for sale for £2.5 million – more than 30 years after it was found as scrap in India.

The aircraft, which regularly takes part in flypasts, was restored by a vintage car buff who discovered the wreck by chance while seeking old Rolls-Royces.

But retired businessman Peter Vacher is now selling the 1940 Hawker Hurricane Mk 1 through an American dealer, fuelling fears that it could be lost to Britain.

Sole survivor: The Hurricane R4118 (pictured) is thought to be the last plane from the Battle of Britain still flying

Hurricane R4118 flew 49 combat sorties during the worst days of the fighting and shot down five enemy aircraft. 

Hurricanes, alongside Spitfires, were at the centre of the country’s heroic defence of the skies in 1940 and had a crucial role until the end of the war, but the vast majority were then scrapped.

Mr Vacher, 72, said: ‘This Hurricane is a one-off. There is no other British plane like it from the Battle of Britain that is flying today. It was a labour of love to recover and restore it and I have enjoyed watching it fly for the past ten years.

Heroic:  Wing Commander Bob Foster, who was responsible for three of the plane’s five ‘kills’ in the Battle of Britain died last month aged 94

‘However, it is time for somebody else to take it on – and my hope is that it will stay in the UK or in Europe. Obviously, there is a possibility that it could go further afield. But it is such an iconic British plane. The sight and sound of it is the Battle of Britain. The public absolutely love it.’

The former printer spotted the aircraft’s rotting hulk in 1982 on a visit to a university at Benares, north-east India, but did not immediately realise what it was.

The plane had been given to engineering students in 1947 after the war in the Far East came to an end. The fuselage was lying in a compound with the propeller, wings and tailplane spread out over the ground.

Mr Vacher, of Abingdon, Oxfordshire, said: ‘It looked like a pile of junk, but once I had found out what it was, I became obsessed with restoring it.’

He returned to India in 1996 and, after a long battle with local bureaucrats, bought the fighter for £25,000 in 2001 and shipped it to Britain. It took four years and 32,000 hours of restoration work, including renovating a Rolls-Royce Merlin III engine, before the Hurricane was once again airworthy. It has since flown in public more than 100 times.

Wing Commander Bob Foster, who was responsible for three of the plane’s five ‘kills’ in the Battle of Britain, died last month aged 94.

A spokesman for the Battle of Britain Memorial Trust said: ‘It would be disappointing if Bob Foster’s Hurricane were to leave the country. It is very special and it would be a shame if it could no longer be seen over the UK.’

The aircraft is being offered for sale through Platinum Fighters.
