New deal for Martinez worth £3million-a-year

Spaniard now contracted to Goodison Park until 2019

Everton chairman Bill Kenwright hails Martinez as 'best young manager in Europe'

Everton have rewarded Roberto Martinez's outstanding first season in charge at Goodison Park with a new five-year contract.

Martinez, who guided Everton back into Europe with fifth place finish, had three years remaining on his current terms but Chairman Bill Kenwright has given him improved terms, that could be worth in the region of £3million per year, until the end of the 2018/19 campaign.

Kenwright believes there is a 'fundamental importance' of the role Martinez performs for Everton and he has moved swiftly to retain the Spaniard, who was considered by Tottenham Hotspur to replace Tim Sherwood and clubs on the continent.

He was not faced with an easy task in succeeding David Moyes 12 months ago when arriving from Wigan Athletic but Martinez has made a deep impression, transforming Everton's playing style, and Kenwright is adamant he is the man to keep driving the club forward.

Kenwright said: 'In many commentators’ eyes, Roberto Martinez is the best young manager in Europe. We agree. He took on an unfamiliar challenge for most Managers, to take something really good and make it even better. He has succeeded.

'In his debut season he broke our Premier League record points haul, got us back into Europe and developed some of the most exciting young footballers in the game. He conducts himself off the pitch in the same way. He undertakes his business with great style, confidence, positivity and class. He is an Everton man.

'There is no magical ingredient to what we do at Everton. We’re a football club and we recognise the fundamental importance of our manager. And, when we find our man, we empower him. We support and provide him with everything at our disposal.

'We commit to our managers, and we’re immensely pleased that Roberto has committed to us. We want the best because only the best will do.'

Martinez, who is currently in Brazil working as an analyst for ESPN but using his time to scout for new players, is relishing the opportunity to lead Everton into Europe next season and insists he did not think twice about reaffirming his commitment to the club

He said: 'I am delighted to have been given the opportunity to make a further commitment to Everton. I loved my first season at the club. I could not be more proud of the way Everton performed throughout the entire season and the memories we were able to make together.

'I am really excited about next season. I knew from the moment I arrived at Everton that this was a special place and I’d like to thank everyone associated with the club, the board, all the staff, the players and our brilliant supporters for believing in me and giving me the opportunity to build on the traditions and success of this great club.'
