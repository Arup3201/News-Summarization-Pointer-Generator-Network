The jury in the trial of a New York police officer accused of conspiring to cannibalism were forced to watch a video of a woman made to appear to be cooked over an open flame.

The evidence, taken from websites devoted to torturing and eating women visited by Officer Gilberto Valle, also included images of women with apples in their mouths and instructions on ‘how to cook a girl’.

The government rested a week after it began trying to prove that Valle tried to conspire with others on the Internet to kidnap, kill and cannibalize six women, including friends and his wife.

Earlier, FBI computer forensics 
examiner Stephen Flatly testified Valle frequently visited websites 
showing women being tortured, including one that offered images of women
who did not survive.

‘Some are dead. A couple of them appeared to have been strangled,’ he said.

As Mr Flatly described the images 
displayed on video monitors in federal court in Manhattan, shocked 
jurors put hands to their mouths and displayed other signs of distress.

One cannibalism website allegedly visited by Valle promised customers they would ‘only receive the highest quality human beef.’

The jury also heard how the officer 
allegedly looked up ‘how to tie up a girl,’ ''human meat recipes,’ ‘how 
to chloroform a girl,’ ‘I want to sell a girl slave,’ ‘how to cook a 
girl,’ ‘death fetish’ and ‘huge cooking tray’ among other topics the 
defense says were part of a fetish fantasy that never posed a real 
threat.

An undated photo submitted as evidence shows Gilberto Valle with his daughter. Valle is accused of conspiracy to kidnap a woman and unauthorized use of a law enforcement database that prosecutors say he used to help build a list of potential targets

The video showed to the jury, which 
was found by the FBI on Valle’s computer, is apparently staged and shows
a naked, screaming woman hanging over an open flame.

Two images of naked women roasting on a
giant spit were discovered in a computer file of several dozen 
photographs that Valle kept on a former college friend whom prosecutors 
have identified as a target of the alleged plot.

The face of one woman prosecutors say he targeted was cut out and pasted onto a cartoon of a woman being boiled in a pot.

Prosecutors also had wanted to present
as many as 34 exhibits of even more ghastly images found on Valle's 
computer depicting women being tortured, dead bodies and body parts.

They include a picture of a dead body 
with the feet cut off which Valle's wife testified she saw when she went
to one of his favorite sites and discovered why he stayed up late 
online.

However U.S. District Judge Paul 
Gardephe ruled they were not admissible because they were automatically 
stored in cache files on Valle's computer.

‘What we don't have is proof that he ever saw the images here,’ he said at the start of the second week of the trial.

However, the judge permitted the 
screenshots of Valle's Internet searches about cannibalism as well as 
proof that the officer looked up articles written about the rape and 
murder of a young woman and others about a 15-year-old girl who was 
kidnapped and murdered in California.

The browsing history also showed that 
an article titled ‘Cannibalism can be addictive, expert says’ and 
Facebook pages of alleged targets were viewed.

As soon as the government finished, 
defense lawyers asked the judge to acquit their client, saying 
prosecutors failed to present sufficient evidence to let a jury decide 
whether Valle planned to carry out a crime. A judge reserved decision. 
Defense attorney Julia Gatto said it has not yet been decided whether 
the officer will testify.

Earlier in the trial, prosecutors 
claimed the 28-year-old was involved in online chats with a Pakistani 
man to whom he offered his ex wife for meat.

At Manhattan Federal Court last week,
testimony by FBI Agent Corey Walsh outlined an an online chat between 
Valle and a man named Aly Khan last year, where Khan said he 'would love
to slaughter a girl and make her meat'.

Valle, who met Khan on a website for 
people who fantasise about eating human flesh, wrote that he was 'trying
to pick out a girl who i can send over'.

He added: 'I can talk my girlfriend into going to India,' where Walsh said Aly Khan claimed to live.

He was referencing Kathleen Mangan, the
woman who would become Valle’s wife about six months later and informed
police about her husband's sexual fantasies after she found material on
his laptop. The pair have a baby daughter.

They go on to talk about 'humiliating' Mangan, taking turns raping her and then slaughtering her together.

Valle, 28, has been held without bail 
since his October arrest. Throughout the trial, his lawyers have 
attacked government evidence as nothing more than a man fantasizing with
like-minded people.

The government has conceded that Valle never met 
the purported Internet co-conspirators and that no women were harmed.

Jurors have heard testimony from 
Valle's estranged wife and from former classmates and other women who 
said they knew Valle on a casual basis and never considered him 
dangerous.

Their testimony was followed by evidence that all of them 
were the subjects of emails and chats describing how they could be 
snatched away and eaten.

The 
charges of conspiracy to kidnap and improper use of a federal database 
system could bring Valle, 28, a life sentence if he's convicted.
