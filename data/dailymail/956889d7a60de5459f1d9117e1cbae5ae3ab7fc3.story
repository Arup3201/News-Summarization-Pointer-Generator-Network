Daniel Sturridge is closing in on a return to the Liverpool side, where he hopes he can end Mario Balotelli's barren spell by striking up a partnership with the misfiring Italian.

The Reds striker posted a picture on Instagram of the pair pointing at each other, accompanied by the caption: 'My man!!! We're gonna be linking up soon!!'

Sturridge has not played for his club since a 3-0 win over Tottenham in August after injuring his thigh on international duty and has only recently returned to Merseyside after treatment in the US.

Despite the  recent resurgence at Anfield, Brendan Rodgers' side has struggled for goals - especially from their strikers with Rickie Lambert and Fabio Borini netting only three league goals between them all season.

Balotelli has not scored a goal in the Premier League since his £16million move from AC Milan in the summer, although Rodgers has ruled out selling the 24-year-old in January.

The manager will be hoping that playing as a foil to Sturridge will help the Italian firebrand rediscover his touch, although Rodgers is determined not to rush the England international back.

Speaking last week, Rodgers said: ‘Daniel Sturridge is back and working well. Obviously he’s not ready to play as of yet but hopefully he’ll be ready in the near future.

‘Time will tell (when he can return). We just want him fit. He’s into the final stages of his rehab but there is no timeline on it.’ 

'Daniel is a key player for us. You put him into any team and it makes them better,' he said. 

'His pace is frightening, his touch, his movement, and he's also improved the defensive part of his game in order to press the ball.

'If he can just sustain that fitness, he's shown what he can do. We're hoping that he can stay fit and lead the charge for us over the next few years.'
