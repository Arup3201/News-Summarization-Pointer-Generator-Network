With no trace of lipstick, not a hint of mascara and barely any colour on her cheeks, Dutch supermodel Lara Stone looks as if she has taken the day off in these exclusive shots from the new CK One Colour campaign.

The model, who is expecting a baby with her comedian husband David Walliams looks fresh-faced and glowingly natural in the images, released to promote CK One Colour's new 3-in-1 foundation.

The foundation is a hybrid serum, colour and primer combination, which delivers fresh, flawless skin, as demonstrated by Stone.

The U.S. fashion brand is famous for its pared down style and the beauty spin off is no exception, with plenty of chic wearable shades on offer but nothing too outrageous.

Stone has a wrap around deal with the brand, which prevents her from posing for anyone else. Her most recent CK campaigns include one for men's cologne, Encounter, which saw her lock lips with Swedish actor, Alexander Skarsgård.

Back in the real world, Stone is just two months from becoming a mother and has been spotted out and about in London with her dog Bert and an enormous bump.

She also took part in a celebrity campaign for the Elton John AIDS Foundation in which she posed alongside fellow models Stephanie Seymour and Joan Smalls in an attempt to raise awareness of the illness and help sufferers struggling with feelings of shame.

Although Stone will be taking things easy for a while, she will still be involved with CK One Colour, including the current campaign for the brand's 3-in-1 foundation.

Along with the ad campaign, the brand will also be holding a 'foundation exchange' at its Debenhams beauty counters nationwide, which allows customers to swap their old pots of foundation for a £10 discount on a new one from CK One Colour.

Hung Vanngo, global make-up artist for CK One Colour advised: 'The CK One 3-in-1 face makeup works best on a clean, well moisturized face. Applying it either with your finger, a sponge, or a foundation brush are all great ways to use it.

'To create a perfect base, most importantly you need to find the right ck one 3-in-1 face makeup shade that matches your face colour.

'The best place to match your colour is along your jawline. After you choose the right colour, apply the face makeup sparingly.

'Only add more if you need it. Apply CK One mousse concealer underneath your eyes, around the nose and other imperfections.

'Lastly, apply the CK One airlight pressed powder SPF 15 with a large powder brush, mainly in the t-zone. The rest of the face should be lightly powdered.

CK One Colour 3-in-1 face makeup SPF 8, £25, is available from selected Debenhams stores and Debenhams.com.

She's famous for her grungy look and her silly gurning but as these shots from the new YSL Beauty campaign prove Cara Delevingne can look every inch the glamorous beauty when she wants to.

Delevingne is the face of the brand's new Babydoll range, including volumising mascara, £24.50, which comes in four different shades and is available from yslbeauty.co.uk and department stores nationwide.

Her glamorous look also makes use of the rest of the Babydoll collection, including gold and rose pink eyeliners, £24 each, and pretty pink La Laque Couture gloss in Rose Babydoll, £23.50.

Lloyd Simmonds, creative director of YSL Beauty and the man behind the make-up, had some advice for would-be Delevingnes who want to get the look, saying: 'I pair this mascara with eyeliner to intensify the result.

'A little graphic line or a smoky effect to create shading along the lash line and amplify the eye’s brightness.

'Even better, a play of two colours makes the eyes look more wide open: I recommend a lighter tone on the inner side and a darker one on the outer side.'
