Carl Froch will make an announcement on his future on Tuesday with the super-middleweight world champion likely to vacate his IBF title.

Froch had hoped to face Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr in Las Vegas next month but suffered an elbow injury in training.

Should he vacate, James DeGale is expected to fight for the belt at the O2 Arena on April 25, with promoter Eddie Hearn keen to pit him against bitter rival George Groves.

Both DeGale and Groves are mandatory challengers for separate belts with DeGale due to face Andre Dirrell while Groves is scheduled to face the American's brother Anthony for the WBC crown.

A rematch on Sky Sports pay-per-view would be a more lucrative option for both Londoners but Groves and Hearn were involved in a social media tit-for-tat on Monday.

Groves said via Sportlobster: 'Wow, Eddie Hearn can talk some waffle. James DeGale in a 50/50?

'I haven't lost a round in my last two fights. James stopped a fat out of shape dude who showed up with no trainer. When I box I sell out arenas or stadiums.

DeGale lost a contentious decision to Groves in 2011 and a rematch seems inevitable in the future

'When James boxes he sells out his soul. I don't need to bow to you Sir Eddie. I'm following my path and I'm not your w****. I'm happy to work hard for it, to gamble with it and to be patient with it. Make me a sensible offer.'

Hearn responded on Twitter: 'James in a 50/50 split for a world title in London in spring or wait forever for 25 per cent of nothing in the US?'.

Groves' trainer Paddy Fitzpatrick waded in to say: 'James could have 25 per cent of millions now or 50 per cent of not much vs Dirrell in a fight that doesn't sell.'

Hearn's response seemed to confirm Froch would indeed be relinquishing his belt.

He said: 'It sells and the split is not up to us Paddy it's a vacant title [so it's] 50/50.'

George Groves looked less than impressive against Dennis Douglin in Liverpool last November
