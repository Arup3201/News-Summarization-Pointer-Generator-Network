An Air Force Academy whistle blower who was recruited to work as an undercover agent and exposed a culture of rape, drug abuse and partying by cadet athletes - especially on the football team - was thanked for his service by being expelled from the academy and kicked out of the military. 

Investigators, including the Air Force's own Inspector General, say that Eric Thomas was instrumental in 'Operation Gridiron,' which led to 37 cadets being kicked out of the academy, including four football players and four basketball players. 

Two offenders, including star defensive back Jamil Cooks, were sentenced to prison time after being convicted of rape. 

Shunned: Eric Thomas was kicked out of the Air Force after working as an undercover informant in an investigation that led to 37 cadets being expelled 

The investigation involved 16 members of the Air Force Falcons football team. Four players were eventually kicked out - two of them sentenced to jail time for committing rape. Jamil Cooks (no 46) was sentenced to five months behind bars but was suspected of half a dozen rapes, authorities say

'I was crucified, I was told how much of a terrible cadet I was,' Thomas told ABC News. 

Lieutenant General Michael Gould, who led the academy until recently, told ABC News that Thomas 'deserved to be disenrolled.'

'You would not want that particular individual to be an officer in our Air Force today,' he said.

The landmark investigation, the biggest ever in the history of the Air Force Academy, has been hailed as a major step toward cleaning up a toxic culture in the athletic department and cracking down on sexual assault - which has become an epidemic in the US military. 

But Mr Thomas, and his handler Office of Special Investigations Sergeant Brandon Enos, paid the price.

Thomas said that as more and more players on the Air Force's vaunted football team became the subject of investigation, he found himself the target of disciplinary hearings. 

The Air Force Falcons football team has brought in millions of dollars in ticket sales, TV deals and alumni donations. As investigators turned up the heat on the team, many top boosters and powerful officers began to show their displeasure with the digging.

Mr Thomas admits that he had received several demerits, but says nearly all of his discipline was a result of performing duties for his undercover work.

The investigation rocked the Air Force Academy to its core and angered many top generals and alumni donors

Lt. General Michael Gould was superintendent of the Air Force Academy at the time and condemned Mr Thomas' actions, saying he should never be an Air Force officer

Sgt. Brian Enos, Mr Thomas' handler, was also drummed out of the Air Force

Sgt Enos was told by his supervisors not to testify in Mr Thomas' defense and the Office of Special Investigations worked to deny that  Mr Thomas had even been a part of the investigation.

Mr Thomas was recruited as an informant by Sgt Enos in April 2011. At the time he was a cadet and a third-string linebacker on the Air Force Falcons football team. 

He agreed at times to wear a wire and report any claims of sexual assault that he encountered. What he recorded for investigators was shocking. 

He went to one party where football players only let women drink out of a Captain Morgan rum bottle with a blue cap. The blue cap, the players said, meant that they had put date rape drugs in the drink. 

At that same party, he heard about players gang raping an unconscious woman. 

Cadets, including football players, also smoked synthetic marijuana and did other drugs at the party, authorities say. 

'I can confidently say there would have been no convictions at the academy probably to this day without Eric,' Sgt Enos told ABC.

However, Sgt Enos didn't fair much better than Mr Thomas. He says he was stripped of his badge and transferred to a job picking up garbage for the Air Force - essentially drummed out. He eventually left after claiming medical disability. 

New York Senator Kirsten Gillibran has called Mr Thomas' dismissal 'a case of retaliation.' She has called for a full investigation. 

Mr Thomas, meanwhile, is appealing the dismissal and has moved back home to South Dakota. He still dreams of flying jets for the Air Force, he says.
