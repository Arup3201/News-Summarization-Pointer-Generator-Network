This is the huge steel arch that will entomb Chernobyl's reactor four, and slash the risk of another radioactive disaster.

The construction, which is one of the biggest engineering projects in history, is being built to seal off nuclear fuel buried inside reactor four which blew up in 1986.

Standing 360 feet tall, and 843 feet wide, the arch will be held together by 680,000 bolts.

The Chernobyl arch is one of the biggest engineering projects in history

The huge arch will seal off the reactor at the plant, which blew up in 1986 releasing deadly radiation across Europe

The arches are being constructed a safe distance away from the reactor site, and will be moved into place when they are completed

Costing Â£1.5billion to build the feat of engineering is a small price to pay to prevent another disaster like the one which blighted generations in the Ukrainian region.

Radiation from the blast also spread across the former USSR and Europe prompting fears at the the time about the safety of nuclear power stations.

Don Kelly, an American nuclear industry veteran, is overseeing the project.

Workers and experts from 24 countries are working on the prestigious project

The reactor at the site was badly damaged in the original explosion and fire, and is too radioactive for the arch to be assembled directly above it

The 1986 disaster forced people to flee from their homes. And 27 years on they have not been able to return

He told the BBC: 'Nothing like this has ever been attempted before.

'For anyone in the nuclear business, this is the place you want to be: the biggest, most exciting project in the world right now.'

Specialists from 24 countries are working on the massive project which reached its halfway point in the autumn.

Ukrainian veterans of the disaster are also advising on the works, which should be completed by 2015.

The arches are being built a few hundred metres away from the actual reactor site

The reactor at the site was badly damaged in the original explosion and fire, and is too radioactive for the arch to be assembled directly above it.

So the construction is being put together at a safer distance in two parts, and when both are ready they will slide along tracks to be clamped together in the correct position.

The project is being paid for by 40 countries, and all staff working at the site have an annual allowance of how much radiation they can be exposed to.

For some working around the chimney at the site, an entire year's allowance could be used up in just a few hours.

When finished the arch will be big enough to house the Statue Of Liberty, and wide enough to encase a football pitch.
