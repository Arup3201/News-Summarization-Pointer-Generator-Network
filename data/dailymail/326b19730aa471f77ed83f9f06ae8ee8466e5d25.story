A senior Metropolitan Police employee received a huge pay-off after leaving the force - taking her total remuneration to just under £400,000 in a single year.

Ailsa Beaton, the Met’s former director of information, received £397,514 in 2012/13, nearly three times Prime Minister David Cameron’s £142,500 salary.

Civilian employee Miss Beaton’s basic salary was just under £194,000, topped up with nearly £170,000 compensation for ‘loss of office’ and more than £33,000 in pension contributions.

IT chief Ailsa Beaton was given a £170,000 payoff on top of her £194,000 salary from the Metropolitan Police in 2012/13

Scotland Yard said it had a ‘contractual liability’ to give her the pay-off - despite a damning report published shortly after she left the force which said its ability to solve crime was being hampered by out-of-date technology dating back to the 1970s.

The Metropolitan Police said the 56-year-old was given the settlement because she could not commit to the force for a long period while a major overhaul of computer systems takes place.

According to a report by the London Assembly’s Budget and Performance Committee - published last August - the Met’s £250m IT budget is spent on ‘out-of-date, ineffective and overly-expensive’ technology.

The report said: ‘The Met does not use technology as well as it could. It has built up its current provision over a number of years without a coherent strategy. Crime is higher as a result and criminals with smartphones often have better technology than London’s police officers.’

Miss Beaton’s pay package was revealed in the College of Policing’s annual report on pay and rewards.

She had spent 12 years at Scotland Yard and was responsible for pushing use of social media such as Twitter and Facebook, and introducing new computer systems.

Scotland Yard said it had a 'contractual liability' to give her the pay-off and says similar packages were given to 'hundreds of staff'

Miss Beaton was awarded the OBE in 2010 for services to policing and, despite her pay-off, has continued working in the public sector as a non-executive member of the Information Commissioner’s Office.

The College of Policing also revealed how some chief constables accepted performance-related bonuses last year.

Norfolk Police’s former chief constable Phil Gormley accepted £58,038 on top of his £168,000 annual salary despite his force being one of the country’s smallest with 1,500 officers. Many other chief constables refused to take their bonuses.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘Miss Beaton received a voluntary exit payment in line with standard civil service terms.

‘This is the same package that has been, and continues to be, offered to many hundreds of Met staff as we seek to transform our organisation and reduce our service support costs.

‘Miss Beaton was eligible to depart under a voluntary exit arrangement because of a new corporate direction regarding our IT transformation and its requirement for sustained leadership over a longer period than Miss Beaton could reasonably commit to.’
