There have been 40 separate threats against New York City police officers reported since the fatal shooting of two officers in Brooklyn Saturday, the NYPD said in a statement Wednesday. 

Officials say that though the threats -- which are under investigation -- have not been deemed credible, four arrests have been made since the shooting, ABC News reports. 

Mayor Bill de Blasio said it is the city's 'obligation' to stop future tragedies. The Mayor vowed Wednesday to protect officers.

Police have increased security at some stationhouses.

Emergency Services Unit officers were providing additional protection at two Brooklyn precincts, where they were stationed starting Tuesday.

NYPD Sgt. Ed Mullins, president of the Sergeants Benevolent Association, said in a statement Wednesday that the department 'received notice there would be a violent act committed at Precincts 73rd, 79th, and 81st in Bedford-Stuyvesant,' the neighborhood where Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu were gunned down Saturday, according to ABC. 

Police said Wednesday they were remaining vigilant while investigating the origin of the threats, which they didn't detail.

Two Officers: Four arrests have been made and 40 separate threats have been reported since the Dec. 20 murder of Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu who were gunned down while sitting in a patrol car

Concern: John Miller, head of NYPD intelligence and counterterrorism, said that out of the 40 threats received by the NYPD, only 'a handful are of concern'

John Miller, head of NYPD intelligence and counterterrorism, told Newsday that out of the 40 threats received by the NYPD, only 'a handful are of concern.' 

'A lot are just angry people blowing off steam with inappropriate comments,' Miller said. 'Some guy says 'I was drunk and didn't mean it' . . . About a half-dozen at any one time are concerning.'

Meanwhile, an 18-year-old was facing charges of making a terroristic threat after authorities said he put up a menacing photo and message online on Saturday hours after the afternoon ambush of  Liu  Ramos by a gunman who had signaled his plans on social media.

Freed: Devon Coley, 18, (photographed) was freed without bail after posting a threatening photo to Facebook 

Teenager Devon Coley posted a photo on his Facebook page Saturday night of a gunman shooting at a patrol car, symbols showing a gun pointed at an officer's head and a caption with his local precinct's number and 'next,' according to a court complaint.

His lawyer, Daniel Ades, said Wednesday that the state terroristic-threats law was being misapplied.

'Nobody's condoning threats against police,' he said, but 'even if this is proven, it doesn't amount to a crime.' He noted that the law requires a 'reasonable expectation or fear' that a threat meant to influence government or intimidate the public is about to be carried out.

Prosecutors sought $250,000 bail for Coley, who was already facing unrelated gun possession and other charges, the New York Post reported. 

Court records show a judge released him without bail on the threats charge.

The New York Post reports that the judge who released Coley, criminal court Judge Laura Johnson, has come under fire for her decision and cops reacted with even more fury when she did so a second time Thursday.

The judge freed Travis Maye, 26, Thursday who was arrested for allegedly punching an officer and he told his arresting officers that he would find out where they live and 'get' them.

'You will die!' he allegedly told the officers. Maye was freed without bail.   

Officials said they had assessed hundreds of online postings and calls to emergency lines, initiating about 40 threat probes, with about half of those being closed or referred to other agencies.

'73Nextt:' Here is the post that prompted the arrest of Coley, the caption reads '73Nextt,' referring to the 73 precinct that covers the teens Brownsville neighborhood

The police department said one 52-year-old man had been arrested after walking into a Manhattan stationhouse and saying: 'If I punch you in the face, how much time will I get?' and refusing to leave.

In addition, two Staten Island residents were arrested in separate incidents on Tuesday. A 16-year-old was arrested on a charge of making a terrorist threat and a 46-year-old man was charged with making a false report.

Mayor de Blasio denounced the various threats Wednesday and said the city 'will protect the men and women who protect us.'

'New York City stands with our police officers in this time of tragedy, as we do every day, and our city will not be intimidated by those spouting hateful, violent messages,' he said in a statement.

'Cowardly threats of violence against the brave men and women of our police force will not be tolerated.'
