A heavily pregnant woman killed along with her seven-year-old son had been living with and caring for her 52-year-old father when all three were shot dead.

Kris-Deann Sharpley was on maternity leave and excitedly awaiting the birth of her little girl who she’d chosen to name Amber Elizabeth Rose after her late mother when she was slain, her sister-in-law Sara Turnball told the Courier Mail.

Kris-Deann’s body was found in a bathroom in her father Derek John Sharpley’s home while the body of her son Jackson was discovered tucked up in bed.

Mr Sharpley’s body was found in the same bedroom and police believe he shot himself after killing his daughter and grandson.

The horrific double-murder suicide has rocked the small town of Biddeston, west of Brisbane in Queensland where it took place.

All three bodies were found by Kris-Deann’s sister Tara on Monday evening when she came to the house to pick up some belongings and to see their pet dogs.

Tara, who is also pregnant, was accompanied by her boyfriend Allan Brown and had to climb through a window to gain access to the house. 

Derek Jackson's body was found in the bedroom with a gunshot wound

Mr Brown told the Courier Mail that Tara screamed out: ‘They’ve been murdered, they’ve been murdered.’

The scene at Toowoomba-Cecil Plains Road home was so grisly it distressed first-response police officers, according to Detective Inspector David Isherwood.

'Two of the victims, both the adult male and female, had very serious wounds to their bodies,' he said. 'Both appear to have been shot in the head.'

A high-calibre weapon was found lying on a bed but police have not established how Jackson, discovered in a bedroom with Derek, died.

Police have said Mr Sharpley's death is not considered suspicious but DI Isherwood stopped short of confirming the tragedy was a double murder-suicide.

'I will say that they are known to police,' he said.

'At this point in time there's nothing to suggest there was any incident that occurred in terms of a disturbance.'

DI Isherwood earlier said that investigations indicate that there is no further threat to public safety.

'I must stress that we are in the early stages of our investigation however it would appear that two of the deaths are suspicious and the death of the man is non suspicious,' he said.

'Two people that live in the town heard three distinct gunshots,' DI Isherwood said. The gunshots were heard on Sunday night but locals presumed it was someone shotting an animal.

'There is no evidence that the house has been broken into when the police arrived they had to force entry into the premises. It would appear that the house was secure. The first person who attended the residence had to climb in to gain entry.'

'Police attended a Biddeston Southbrook Road address around 6.50pm after the bodies of a man, woman and boy were located. The three aged 52, 27 and 7 respectively, were all known to each other,' Queensland Police said.

The shooting happened on the corner of Toowoomba-Cecil Plains Road and Biddeston-Southbrook Road at Biddeston - more than 150 kilometres west of Brisbane.

'There are no concerns for public safety,' a police spokesman said.

'Detectives are on scene and a crime scene has been established.'
