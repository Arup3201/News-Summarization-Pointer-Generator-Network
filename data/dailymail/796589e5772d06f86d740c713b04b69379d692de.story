Three mobile phone network is set to spark a price war among providers after pledging to offer customers ultrafast 4G services as a free upgrade.

The company promised to make the recently unveiled 4G - said to run five times faster than the current 3G network - a standard feature on all smartprice plans when it is added to the network later this year.

The move is a bold attempt to undercut competitors as EE - the only company which is currently able to offer 4G - is currently charging customers at least £5 a month extra for the service.

Superfast: Three will be offering the 4G network on handsets including the iPhone 5, left, and the Samsung Galaxy SIII, right

Mobile wars: Three's decision not to charge extra for 4G is likely to spark more competition among providersBritain’s first 4G network was launched by EE in London and nine other cities in October last year.

But currently users must pay extra for the service and also fork out hundreds of 
pounds for a smartphone that can use the system, such as Apple’s iPhone 5
 or Nokia’s Lumia 920.

Three will offer the service as standard with current price plans for an iPhone 5 on a monthly contract ranging from £34 to £44 a month plus up to £99 for the handset.

A Samsung Galaxy SIII costs £29 to £31 a month plus up to £29 for the handset on the same type of contract.

Dave Dyson, from Three UK, said: 
'As we add the next wave of technology to our Ultrafast network, we’ve 
listened to our customers and thought long and hard about the right way 
to do it. We don’t want to limit Ultrafast services to a select few 
based on a premium price and we’ve decided our customers will get this 
service as standard.'

The 4G system allows smartphones, tablets and laptops to surf the web five times faster than the current 3G network.

Cheaper? Price plans for the iPhone 5 with Three currently range from £34 to £44 a month on a pay monthly contract

EE customers who have upgraded to 4G packages pay anything from £36 to £56 a month based on the amount of data downloads they sign up for.

Many other countries already offer the faster network and most providers charge around 20 per cent more for it.

Three’s network covers 55 per cent of the UK population with an initial focus on 50 towns and cities, reaching 80 per cent population coverage by the end of March.

Three customers able to benefit from the upgrade include those with the Apple iPhone 5, Nokia Lumia 920, Sony Xperia Z, Apple iPad mini and Apple iPad with Retina display.

Device choice is growing rapidly with new ultrafast-ready LTE versions of the Samsung Galaxy S III and Galaxy Note II being launched on Three within the next month, and the BlackBerry Z10 launching mid-February.
