Robert F Kennedy Junior had an affair with the wife of plastic surgeon to the stars Laurence Kirwan behind the back of his fiancée Cheryl Hines, it is claimed today.

With just weeks before RFK Jr is set to say ‘I Do’ to the Curb Your Enthusiasm star, sources close to Professor Kirwan have revealed how his estranged wife, Connecticut socialite Chelsea Chapman Kirwan, struck up a close friendship with the Kennedy scion that has spanned the past two years.

A high-profile surgeon with offices in London, New York and Connecticut, a source close to Prof Kirwan, 62, told MailOnline: ‘He was well aware that his wife and Bobby had a friendship before their split and that they have had ongoing telephone calls.’

It is believed a friendship started well before the Kirwans separated on July 
4, 2012 - and a source reveals how Chelsea’s cell phone records show she was 
speaking to RFK Jr five times a day in August 2012.

The exact nature of Chelsea’s relationship with RFK Jr could well come out in court next month when Prof Kirwan will appeal to try and modify the protection order currently in place over his visitation rights with his three children with Chelsea, 42. The case will be heard on July 22 in Connecticut.

Allegedly, Chelsea actually told Prof. Kirwan that she had met Bobby at the gym in Armonk, New York.

A source said: 'She didn’t say they were having an affair, but she was obviously infatuated. RFK Jr gave her his book which she was reading, she was very impressed by him.

‘Prof Kirwan’s away in London a lot of the time, he doesn’t have any physical proof – but if it looks like it and sounds like it, the likelihood is they were having an affair.

‘Certainly, Prof Kirwan believes the relationship was inappropriate.’

Indeed, the source close to Prof Kirwan believes Chelsea’s ‘game plan’ was to ‘trade up to RFK Jr’, however, a source close to Chelsea insisted: 'There was no trading up, that's just ridiculous.'

Last week, the National Enquirer reported that RFK Jr had had an affair behind the back of Cheryl Hines with an unnamed woman, now known to be Chelsea, but later dumped her.

The publication said that RFK Jr ‘turned on the Kennedy charm to woo the woman into bed, with a source saying. He’s a no-good horn dog!’. It claimed the liaison lasted for two years.

All smiles: Robert Kennedy Jr and Cheryl Hines tied the knot on August 2 - despite allegations of his infidelity

Tying the knot: RFK Jr, an environmental lawyer, revealed hjs engagement to Curb Your Enthusiasm actress Chery Hines in April at Muhammad Ali's Celebrity Fight Night in Phoenix, Arizona

RFK
 Jr, a father of six, began dating Cheryl, 48, in 2012, months before 
his estranged wife, Mary Richardson, tragically committed suicide in May
 2012 at their Mount Kisco, New York home aged just 52.

The couple are expected to tie the knot this summer during the Kennedys' annual reunion in Hyannis Port.

The pair are planning a ceremony at the Kennedy compound with close friends and family invited, including mom Ethel Kennedy, Page Six reported.

This
 will be the second marriage for Cheryl, who has a 10-year-old 
daughter Catherine from her previous marriage to Paul Young.

RFK
 Jr, an environmental lawyer, revealed their engagement at the end of 
April at Muhammad Ali’s Celebrity Fight Night in Phoenix, Arizona.

And asked about their relationship, Cheryl said recently: 
'We share the same values. Family first. We like to have a good time and
 work hard. It’s fun to have a partner...It’s a good match-up.'

Meanwhile, Prof Kirwan and his estranged wife split on July 4, 2012, prompting a bitter divorce.

Then
 in August 2012, the surgeon was charged with attacking Chelsea and his 
step daughter in an angry confrontation at their family home in 
Connecticut, a six-bedroom, $5.9 million property complete with swimming pool.

But he later turned himself in to police, and was arrested and placed in custody.

He
 was charged with third degree assault and disorderly conduct against 
his alleged victims - Chelsea and her daughter Tailor, then 18, now 20.

'We share the same values': Cheryl Hines - pictured with Robert F Kennedy Jr at the Deer Valley Celebrity Skifest in Utah in December 2012 - spoke out about their  marriage, saying: 'It's fun to have a partner. It's a good match up.'

A
 'full protective order' was issued in the case, meaning Prof Kirwan was
 temporarily banned from living under the same roof as any of his 
children covered by the order.

He was allowed contact with them, but only as part of a supervised visit.

However, he was not allowed to get in touch with Chelsea after a 'no contact' order was put in place by the courts.

In
 August 2012, Prof Kirwan, who considers British TV host Ulrika Jonsson among his patients, told the Daily Mail that he had been 
unfaithful to Chelsea, but said: ‘I admit that I’ve not acted like a 
saint, but I never wanted my marriage to end.’

He
 admitted that long absences took a toll on his first marriage to 
Fenella, a half English-half Italian Oxford University graduate with whom he has four children – twin daughters now aged 30, another 
daughter, 27, and a son, 25.  One of the twins is currently starring on 
the Food Network. He is still on good terms with Fenella and all of the 
children.

Prof Kirwan divorced Fenella in 2000. By then he had met Chelsea when she attended his practice to have her skin blemishes treated. They wed in 2001 and have twins aged eleven, and an eight-year-old daughter, who has Down’s syndrome.

Going strong: The actress has been dating Robert Kennedy Jr since 2012 and happily brought him along when she was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in January

Admitting to indiscretions,Prof Kirwan nonetheless said: ‘I have the greatest respect for my wife and I 
have tried hard to save my marriage. I still want to do everything 
possible to work it out.’

There are now new attorneys working on the divorce case following a mistrial and Prof Kirwan and his wife have a court date in September of this year.

In November, the charges will be dropped as he will have completed his two years probation, if he successfully adheres to the protection order and the guidelines set by the court.

When reached by MailOnline, Prof Kirwan declined to comment, while Chelsea Kirwan Chapman declined to comment.
