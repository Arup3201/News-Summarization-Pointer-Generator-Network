Sources say there was a warrant out for Kaitlyn's arrest for the old offence and the wrestler and model was released on a $315 bond.

to Michigan, I was cited for a traffic 
violation.

'I am fully cooperating with authorities to resolve the 
matter.'

It was believed Kaitlyn was at the arena to film a WWE Smackdown taping.

She did not make any mention of the arrest today on her Twitter account.

In her most recent WWE storyline, Kaitlyn challenged Eve for her championship title, but was unsuccessful.

But an attack by fellow wrestler Aksana before the match may have been a contributing factor.

Before joining 
WWE, she spent years in competitive fitness and bodybuilding.
