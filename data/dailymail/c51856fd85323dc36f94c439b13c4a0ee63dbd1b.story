A North Carolina lottery winner is being sued by the store owner who sold her the ticket after allegedly agreeing to split the $1 million jackpot.

Mother-of-five Eva Reyes, 53, is accused of promising USA Liquors owner Laxmi Bhardwaj half the winnings because he loaned her the money to enter an Emerald 10 scratch card in January.

Though Reyes claims she promised to give $50,000, court documents include a note in her handwriting that allegedly confirms they would each take $350,000 after taxes.

But her attorney claims the Milpitas store owner fabricated the letter.

Distressed: Mother-of-five Eva Reyes claims she promised to give her store owner $50,000 for loaning her money to buy a scratch card, but the owner says she promised to give half of the $1 million jackpot

Promise? Reyes' attorney claims the Milpitas store fabricated this note promising $350,000 after tax

'It says $50,000 across the middle, then after it appears, I don't know, it appears somebody may have tried to squeeze in "three hundred thousand" in hindsight,' Reyes' attorney Nelson McElmurry told NBC.

'He's trying to shatter her little piece of the American dream,' McElmurry said.

Reyes, of San Jose, won $1,000 from a similar scratch card in December, and claims she gave the store $100 as a gesture of good will.

Claims: In court documents, Laxmi Bharwaj, owner of USA Liquors, says Reyes made the deal in the store

This is the moment Reyes received the $1 million winnings - her second scratch card success in two months

Bhardwaj claims she gave them $500.

Now Reyes says she wants all the money to herself to take her family on holiday to Hawaii.

She told NBC: 'Before I wanted to give the $50,000, but later I say forget it. Why do I have to give it? I won the money.'

The pair will meet in court on March 13.
