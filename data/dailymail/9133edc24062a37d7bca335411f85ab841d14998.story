British Olympic diver Tom Daley has revealed he is in a gay relationship in an emotional video posted on Youtube this morning. 

The Olympic bronze medallist tweeted thanks to his mother for her support, but also revealed some members of his family advised against him going public with the news of his sexuality.

Daley has dated girls but says he entered into the relationship in Spring of this year, something that has turned his life upside down.

Something to say: Daley has posted a video on YouTube where he reveals he is in a gay relationship

He said: 'Come Spring this year, my life changed, massively, when I
 met someone and they make me feel so happy, so safe and everything just
 feels great.

'Well that someone is a guy. And it did take me by surprise
 a little bit. It was always in the back of my head that something like 
that could happen. But it wasn’t until Spring this year that something 
just clicked, it felt right. And I was like: OK.

'Like I said, my whole 
world just changed right there and then. Of course, I still fancy girls,
 but right now I’m dating a guy and I couldn’t be happier. I feel safe 
and it just feels right.'

Olympic ambition: Daley won bronze in London last year where his good friend Tonia Couch also competed 

Revealing the news to his family was particularly difficult for Daley - who received full support from his mum, Debbie.

Some members of his family has 'mixed opinions' on him revealing he was in a same sex relationship and wanted him to remain silent about it.

He said: 'My mum’s 
been so supportive as well, I can count the number of people on my hand 
that I've told, but all my friends and family that I have told have been
 so supportive and great.

'But I told the rest of my family today and let’s just say they had mixed
 opinions, lots of them didn’t believe it, lots of them wanted me to 
keep it quiet.'

Hi guys, so most of you are probably wondering why I’m doing this video.

My life’s been a bit of a rollercoaster, to say the least, over the last
 couple of years. Losing my dad to cancer in 2011 was one of the hardest
 things I’ve ever had to deal with in my life. Then winning an Olympic 
medal last year in 2012 in front of a home crowd, finishing my A Levels 
this year.. it’s been hectic.

One thing I consider to be pretty important is to have some form of 
private life and you're probably thinking 'well why did you do a book 
and why did you do a documentary and stuff' but I've only ever talked 
about things I feel comfortable talking about.

When I was younger I 
didn't like talking about a bullying situation at school, I didn’t like 
talking about my dad because at the time it was a sensitive subject.

It’s one of those things where in an ideal world I shouldn’t be doing 
this video because it shouldn’t matter but recently I was misquoted in 
an interview and it made me feel really angry and frustrated. Emotions 
that I’ve never felt before when reading quotes about myself.

Honesty, 
for me is something I really do believe in. And I’ve always been honest.
 I may have been vague in some of my answers, but one thing I’ve never 
felt that comfortable talking about are my relationships, because it is 
what I get asked even if I’m doing sporting interviews ‘do you have a 
girlfriend, who are you seeing’ all that sort of stuff.

I mean, I've been dating girls and I've never really had a serious 
relationship to talk about. Now I kind of feel ready to talk about 
relationships. Come Spring this year, my life changed, massively, when I
 met someone and they make me feel so happy, so safe and everything just
 feels great.

Well that someone is a guy. And it did take me by surprise
 a little bit. It was always in the back of my head that something like 
that could happen. But it wasn’t until spring this year that something 
just clicked, it felt right. And I was like: OK.

Like I said, my whole 
world just changed right there and then. Of course, I still fancy girls,
 but right now I’m dating a guy and I couldn’t be happier. I feel safe 
and it just feels right.

People are going to have their own opinions and people are going to make
 a deal of this. Is it a big deal? I don’t think so. People are going to
 call me a liar, it’s going to be big, but I wanted to say something and
 right now I’m ready and I wanted to do it.

People will think: what would your dad say? Well he always said: 'if 
you're happy, I'm happy' and right now I couldn’t be happier. My mum’s 
been so supportive as well, I can count the number of people on my hand 
that I've told, but all my friends and family that I have told have been
 so supportive and great.

But I told the rest of my family today and let’s just say they had mixed
 opinions, lots of them didn’t believe it, lots of them wanted me to 
keep it quiet. Some said why don’t you just do a statement, why don’t 
you do a magazine cover, why don’t you do a TV interview? But I didn’t 
want to get my words twisted, I wanted to put an end to the rumours and 
just say it, to tell you guys. Because it’s what I want to do.

My friends and family are always there to support me and I hope you guys
 can be too. I’m still Tom, I still want to win a gold medal for Great 
Britain in Rio in 2016. I’m still as motivated as ever to do that, and 
it would be great to have you guys on that journey too.

I just wanted to
 make sure that I got to tell you guys before I head off to Houston for a
 training camp I’ve got up until Christmas. I’m glad that I’ve got it off my chest.

And I hope you can join me on my journey to Rio 2016, too.
