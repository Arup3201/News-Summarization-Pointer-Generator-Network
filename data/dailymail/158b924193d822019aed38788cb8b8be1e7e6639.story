Americans radicalized by
online propaganda from Islamic State and other militant groups
pose the main terrorist threat to the United States, which is
especially vulnerable to foreign fighters returning from Syria,
senior U.S. security officials said on Wednesday.

While there is no evidence that the radical Islamist group
plans an attack on U.S. soil, its vigorous propaganda machine
and sophisticated online recruitment efforts created a clear
potential threat, they said.

A law enforcement bulletin obtained by FoxNews.com warned that Islamic State fighters have increased calls for 'lone wolves' to attack U.S. soldiers in America in recent months, citing one tweet that called for jihadists to find service members' addresses online and then 'show up and slaughter them.'  

The heads of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Homeland
Security and the National Counterterrorism Center issued the
warning in a hearing before the House Homeland Security
Committee.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson:  The U.S. is able to track Westerners who travel to and from Syria, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson says. But inside Syria, there are intelligence gaps

They spoke as the U.S. military prepared to expand U.S.-led
military action against Islamic State from Iraq to Syria,
 and before a House of Representatives vote on
President Barack Obama's request to arm Syrian rebels to fight
the militants.

Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Islamic State
was committed to attacking Americans just because they were 
Americans, as shown in videos it released in recent weeks of the
beheadings of journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff.

The group's threat lies in its online attempts to radicalize
Americans and its efforts to recruit from 2,000 Westerners who
have traveled to Syria to fight President Bashar al-Assad's
government, the officials said.

The foreign fighters, who included 100 Americans, 'may
eventually return to their home countries battle-hardened,
radicalized and determined to attack us,' said Matt Olsen, the
leading U.S. counterterrorism official.

There will be 'a continued call - by Western fighters in Syria and terrorist organizations - for lone offender attacks against U.S. military facilities and personnel,' warned a July law enforcement intelligence bulletin from the Central Florida Intelligence Exchange, a state-run agency that gathers, assesses and shares threat information and works with the Department of Homeland Security.

 'These threats will most likely increase should the U.S. or its allies attack the Islamic State of Iraq and Sham (ISIS) in Syria or Iraq.' 

Making a plan: US President Barack Obama addresses the media following briefings with US Central Command officials on the Islamic State (IS) militant group during a visit to MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida, USA,

'U.S.-based [Home-Grown Violent Extremists] could be inspired by this rhetoric to turn their attention towards carrying out attacks at home,' the bulletin states.

The radical rhetoric is delivered via social media, where Islamic State operatives have long exhorted westerners to get on a plane and come join the battle. But terrorists now believe they can have a powerful effect from afar just by inspiring attacks inside the U.S.

'In recent Twitter posts, foreign fighters in Syria have encouraged Muslims in the West to target soldiers with spontaneous attacks using small arms (i.e. knives and guns),' the bulletin said.

He said Syria remained a key training ground for independent
or al Qaeda-aligned groups, and that the rate of travelers going
to Syria exceeded that of those who went to Afghanistan,
Pakistan, Iraq, Yemen or Somalia in the last 10 years.

Lawmakers pressed the administration officials on how they
can prevent attacks by so-called homegrown violent extremists or
Syria foreign fighters who may carry U.S. or European passports.

The officials cited the arrest of a Rochester, New York, man
announced on Tuesday, on charges of trying to provide material
support to Islamic State and attempting to murder U.S. soldiers.

FBI Director James Comey acknowledged the difficulties of
countering the homegrown threat. 'In a country this big and this
free, with the material that is available, it's a big
challenge,' he said.

The administration officials outlined threats from militant
groups around the world, including al Qaeda offshoots, and said
they continued to focus on airline security to counter a primary
threat.

President Obama admonished ISIS this afternoon and promised the group that 'If you threaten America, you will find no safe haven. We will find you eventually'

Olsen singled out Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which
was behind three attempted airline bombings, including the 2009
underwear bomber in Detroit, as the al Qaeda splinter group 
most likely to attempt an attack inside the United States.

But Olsen said 'homegrown violent extremists remain the most
likely immediate threat to the homeland.'

Johnson identified such 'lone wolf' attackers as the hardest
to detect and said his agency was working with communities to
identify people vulnerable to recruitment by extremist groups
through online propaganda.

'This boundless virtual environment, combined with
terrorists' increasingly sophisticated use of social media,
makes it increasingly difficult to protect our youth from
propaganda,' Olsen said.

'This online environment is likely to play a critical role
in the foreseeable future in radicalizing and mobilizing (them)
towards violence,' he said.
