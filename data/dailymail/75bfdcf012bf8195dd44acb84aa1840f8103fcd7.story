Presumably nobody at Manchester United explained to Louis van Gaal how the English fixture list works. If they had, he surely wouldn't be complaining about the number of matches in December.

United started a run of nine games in 36 days with the 3-0 win over Hull on Saturday and the Dutchman has had a good old whinge about the packed schedule and the fact he can't spend Christmas at home in the armchair in the corner.

‘I’m not happy but I cannot change it,’ said Van Gaal, whose team face Stoke on Tuesday. ‘I don’t agree with it because I don’t think that it is good for the players that they play another match within two days. In December, it shall be like that.

Manchester United face a busy Christmas schedule which could well define their season

‘We also have families. I also have a wife and kids and grandchildren and I cannot see them this Christmas.

'But I want to work in the Premier League, I have to adapt and I shall adapt. But I don’t think it is good for players, neither for the families.’

Here's the smallest violin in the world Louis, just for you.

What Van Gaal, who has now presided over a whopping 14 competitive fixtures in around four months, forgets is that it's the same for everyone.

Liverpool, for instance, have 11 matches in the next month, including FA Cup third-round weekend.  

It's not like United's players will be overburdened in the new year, either, seeing as they failed to qualify for Europe and were dumped out of the Capital One Cup by MK Dons.

There have been a lot of injuries but the ludicrously lop-sided buying policy (carried out by a Mr A van Gaal, no less) has not helped.

And let's face it, when January rolls around Van Gaal could get another £100million to chuck around on new players if anyone picks up a bad injury, despite senior figures at the club insisting there will be no spending in the upcoming transfer window.

The festive fixture list is one of the things that makes English football great, so the Dutchman will just have to lump it as he continues to adapt to his not-so new surroundings.

And he can console himself with the thought that by the time this 36-day spell is over he will have earned £690,000 - plenty of money with which to buy presents for those neglected family members.

Merry Christmas.
