The BBC was criticised yesterday for not describing the armed jihadists behind the Kenya shopping centre siege as terrorists.

The corporation’s journalists have avoided using the words ‘terrorist’ and ‘terrorism’ in reports.

Instead, they described the terrorists as ‘Islamist militants’ or ‘suspected Al Shabaab militants’ - and only used the word terrorist in when quoting someone else.

Beating around the bush? BBC News coverage of the violence in Nairobi, Kenya, has repeatedly referred to the perpetrators as 'militants', rather than the using the word terrorists, leading to criticism from politicians

Critics said the BBC was guilty of 
‘covering’ for the jihadists. One senior backbench MP said the BBC was 
‘out of touch’ on the issue.

Douglas Murray, associate director of 
the Henry Jackson Society think-tank, said: ‘By not calling these 
jihadists what they actually are, the BBC is effectively covering for 
them.

‘No-one wants to say they are jihadis, which they are. No-one wants to say they are Islamic extremists, which they are.

‘Most
 people know what these people are and it’s only certain sections of 
government and the media which refuses to point the finger.’

Rob
 Wilson, Conservative MP for Reading East, said: ‘Most members of the 
British public would see the planned and systematic murder of dozens of 
innocent people in Kenya as terrorism.

BBC News presenter Ben Brown delivers the headlines: It is understood that BBC guidance issued to staff tells them to avoid using the term 'terrorist' without attribution, but politicians have reacted with anger

‘Sadly,
 the BBC looks like it has made a bad judgement call on this and is out 
of touch with ordinary people on a very important issue.’

BBC
 guidelines suggest avoiding the use of the word 'terrorism' because it is
 a ‘difficult and emotive subject with significant political overtones’.

They
 state: ‘We try to avoid the use of the term “terrorist” without 
attribution. When we do use the term we should strive to do so with 
consistency in the stories we report across all our services and in a 
way that does not undermine our reputation for objectivity and 
accuracy.’

A BBC spokesman 
said: ‘There has been no specific advice issued for this story. We 
always think very carefully about the language we use.

‘We
 do not ban words but the BBC does have general guidelines about 
accurate and careful language, depending on the context of a story.

Rob Wilson, Conservative MP

‘The
 BBC has referred to the events as a terror attack and has at times 
referred to the attackers as terrorists and at other times as militants,
 or used other phrases which are accurate and help tell the story.’

In January David Cameron criticised the corporation for describing those behind the Algerian hostage attack as ‘militants’.

BBC bosses were also criticised this year when journalists were told not to describe hate cleric Abu Qatada as an ‘extremist’.
