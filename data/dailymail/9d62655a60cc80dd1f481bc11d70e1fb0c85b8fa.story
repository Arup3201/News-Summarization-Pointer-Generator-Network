A mysterious aquatic creature has washed up on the shore at Mudjimba Beach on the Sunshine Coast.

The creature was discovered on the sand on Monday morning by Debbie Higgs, a local who walks on the beach every day.

The unidentified creature is bright red, has ribbing, no limbs, eyes of mouth and has what looks like frills around it.

'It's definitely not a plant, it feels spongy like a jelly fish,' Ms Higgs told Daily Mail Australia, 'it's cold and rather smelly.'

'I had no idea what it was so I took a picture of it and tweeted it,' she said 'I had so many retweets and responses from people speculating what it was.'

After discovering the 'blob' Ms Higgs photographed it and left it on the beach, but after she got so many tweets she went back for it.

'It is about 25 cm long, so about the length of my arm. I had a tea towel in the car so I picked it up and took it home and put it in a bucket of salty water.'

The 'blob' appears to have no face or limbs.  Ms Higgs who came across the creature on a walk on the beach says that it feels soft and spongy and smells bad

The slimy red creature has caused speculation on Twitter about what it actually is.  Many have said it appears to be a Spanish Dancer slug

She was determined to find out what it was so she continued posting images of the mysterious sea creature on social media.

'I've never seen anything like it and I'm on that beach every day. People were saying on Twitter that it might be a Spanish Dancer Slug,' Ms Higgs said.

Spanish Dancer slugs are most common in the warmer tropical waters of the Indian Ocean.

Ms Higgs' Twitter feed has been inundated with suggestions about what the bright red creature is.

Some have retweeted and tagged experts while others have taken the comedic route of saying it is 'The red Teletubby' or 'whale placenta' and one person even made a cheeky comparison to Prime Minister Abbott in budgie smugglers.

Twitter users have a laugh suggesting the creature looks like the red Teletubby or a liver

A spokeswoman for Queensland Museum told Sunshine Coast Daily, it was difficult to tell without examining it closely however they felt it was a sea slug.

'I'm not sure what to do with it now, I took it home in case it was something extremely rare or something. I'll probably hand it over to the aquarium if it is, otherwise I'll just take it back to the beach.'

The CSIRO has been contacted and is yet to identify the mysterious creature.
