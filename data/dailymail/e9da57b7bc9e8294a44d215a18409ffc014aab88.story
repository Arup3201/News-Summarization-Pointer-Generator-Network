A local council is in uproar after a politician who was found guilty of sexual battery has refused to step down from his job.

Chris Dumler had faced a felony forcible sodomy charge but pleaded guilty to the lesser charge in January. He was given a 12-month suspended sentence but is due to spend a month in jail from March 8.

Colleagues who had originally stood by the county supervisor in Albemarle County, Virgina said on Tuesday that he is now becoming too much of a distraction to council meetings.

Sex charges: Albemarle County Supervisor Chris Dumler pleaded guilty to misdemeanor sexual battery in January and is due to spend a month in jail from March 8

There have been outbursts from citizens at public meetings, most recently on Monday during a discussion about school funding.

One protestor Jamie Morgan pointed at 27-year-old Dumler and screamed: 'He disrupted people's lives and he is rolling his f****** eyes.'

Police have had to provide extra security at the events.

The Albemarle County Board of Supervisors have urged the local politician to step down along with the Sexual Assault Resource Agency and the Jefferson Area Tea Party.

Dumler has so far refused to give up his position saying that the criminal conviction does not affect how well he does his job. He requested to serve his sentence on the weekends so that he can stay in his job.  However he has left his seat on the Jail Authority Board, citing a conflict of interest.

Former allies continue to desert him. Supervisor Rodney Thomas told NBC29: 'It's going to be so distracting on what we have to do as a board, it's just bringing everything down.'

Another politician said that keeping Dumler on the board sent out the 'wrong message'. Discussions are already taking place as to who might fill his senior role. 

Following his jail term, Dumler will be on probation for two years and was forced to make a public apology to his victim.

Growing anger: Virgina residents have been turning up to public meetings attended by Dumler to show their disgust that he has not stepped down

The statement, posted on Newsplex, read: 'While I am pleased to have this matter 
completed, it is very important that I apologize to the complainant in 
this case.

'I am profoundly sorry for any hurt that my actions caused 
her. Additionally, to the others who were hurt or disappointed by my 
behavior, to them I humbly apologize.'

The charges stem from 2006, when Dumler was in his first year of law school at the University of Virginia.

Two other women had accused Dumler of sexual assaults but as part of his plea deal, police agreed to drop other investigations.
