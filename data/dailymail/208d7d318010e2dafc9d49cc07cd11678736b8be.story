Malcolm-Jamal Warner said it was 'painful' to watch Cosby face sexual allegations 

Bill Cosby's onscreen son, Malcolm-Jamal Warner, has opened up about the sexual assault allegations mounting against his former co-star, saying it was 'painful' to watch.

Warner, 44, was being interviewed by Billboard on Wednesday following his Grammy nomination for his work on Robert Glasper's Black Radio 2 album.

The musician and actor, who played Cosby's son Theo Huxtable in the sitcom from 1984-1992, said it was difficult to watch Cosby face allegations 'just as it's painful to hear any woman talk about sexual assault, whether true or not'.

Warner didn't directly address the allegations made by at least 15 women, citing a lack of first-hand knowledge.  

However, he added: ''The Bill Cosby I know has been great to me and great for a lot of people. What he's done for comedy and television has been legendary and history-making.

'What he's done for the black community and education has been invaluable. That's the Bill Cosby I know.'

Warner and his mentor Cosby were believed to be close after the comedian wrote the role of Theo Huxtable based on own son Ennis - even incorporating real-life conversations the father and son had into the script.

Ennis Cosby, the TV star's only son with whom Warner was also friendly, was shot dead in a car-jacking in LA in 1997.  

Cosby, 77, has not been charged with a crime and through his attorney has denied allegations, some of them dating back decades, that he drugged and assaulted women. 

Warner's cautious remarks came soon after a fellow TV star, and former producer of one of Cosby's TV shows, said that the allegations made against Cosby were true.

Alan Thicke, who starred in Growing Pains and was a producer on Cosby's variety show Cos back in the 70s, said in a recent interview with the Toronto Star: 'There is no doubt in my mind Bill Cosby was a bad boy.'

That being said, Thicke was also quick to point out that he never once witnessed any of this behavior from Cosby.

'In my history with Bill, I saw absolutely nothing of the controversy around him now,' said Thicke.'I just saw a guy who was doing his job.'  

Cosby is continuing his North American stand-up tour, seemingly oblivious to the protesters who were gathering outside his shows. Several promoters and venues have canceled performances amid dwindling ticket sales. 

NBC also said earlier this month that they would not be moving forward with a previously announced show featuring the actor.

'Fifteen women came out and accused him of what they accused him of,' said NBC Entertainment Chairman Bob Greenblatt. He also said it was 'safe to say' the network would never again work with Cosby in any capacity.  

In other recent developments, Cosby's lawyer Martin Singer announced last week that he had evidence the actor was in New York City on the night model Chloe Goins accused him of drugging and sexually assaulting her at the Playboy Mansion.

Goins, who claims she was attacked by Cosby in 2008, is the first woman to come forward whose allegations did not fall outside the statue of limitations.
