Wayne Rooney is set to win his 100th England cap against Slovenia on Saturday. But despite his haul and a stunning medal collection at Manchester United, debate still rages whether he is a true great of English football.

Sportsmail's Three Wise Men - JAMIE CARRAGHER, JAMIE REDKNAPP and MARTIN KEOWN give their verdicts on a brilliant but turbulent career so far and reveal what they think the future holds for England's ninth centurion.

Q: What is your favourite Rooney memory in an England shirt?

REDKNAPP: Probably his first tournament - Euro 2004. He was a boy in a man’s body: so strong, aggressive and raw. He took Europe by storm. He played with real joy, sprinkled with aggression. 

CARRAGHER: I have to go back to the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon 10 years ago. I will never forget being on the substitutes’ bench for the opening game against France and seeing the look of shock and panic on the faces of the French defenders faces when Wayne started bulldozing his way past them.

KEOWN: His second goal against Croatia at Euro 2004, when he was one-on-one with the keeper. It looked like it was his 100th cap, not his first major tournament. He was so cool.

Peter Shilton - 125 caps

David Beckham - 115

Steven Gerrard - 114

Bobby Moore - 108

Ashley Cole - 107

Bobby Charlton - 106

Frank Lampard - 106

Billy Wright - 105

Q: 100 caps is a great achievement, but has Rooney been the player he could have been?

CARRAGHER: After the European Championship, we all thought we had a future World Player of the Year in our ranks who would take England to glory. He was fearless and unplayable in that tournament, his impact was incredible. It hasn’t quite worked out the way we all thought but, listen: very few players get to the level of world’s best. There might not be an international trophy but he’s still had a phenomenal career.

REDKNAPP: It is very difficult to criticise someone who has reached 100 caps. But we did expect more from him back then. He’s our most talented player in a long time but he hasn’t scored enough goals in major tournaments. He has just one goal in a World Cup. But he’s had an incredible career and is not the first great player to be better for their club than their country. He will probably admit it hasn’t always gone the way he’d have liked.

KEOWN: When he arrived on the scene so young, we wondered if he’d be the greatest who has ever played for England. He is one of the greats but not the all-time great. Only at the last World Cup did he seem to be fit going into a major tournament. There is a feeling that he hasn’t quite lived up to expectations. But we were asking too much of him, especially at tournaments.

Q: Rooney will be England’s ninth centurion - who is your personal favourite?

REDKNAPP: Bobby Moore, because he’s the only one who lifted the World Cup and my dad spoke about him in glowing terms. I love hearing my dad’s stories about him. Everything he did was so meticulous, he even ironed his underpants.

KEOWN: I didnt see the 1966 team so I’d choose Steven Gerrard. I saw his brilliant raw material straight away. He was quiet at first and I enjoyed helping him when he first came into the squad. He was less confident than Frank Lampard and I wish had been captain for longer.

CARRAGHER: I would have to choose Sir Bobby Charlton. He is the best player we have ever had, he remains our leading goalscorer and, as a member of the 1966 squad, his place in history has long since been secured. He was a truly world-class performer for club and country. Most importantly, he was a gentleman and remains so to this day.

99 England caps, 43 England goals 

Q: What does Rooney need to do to extend his England career?

REDKNAPP: Just stay in the Manchester United team - then he’ll break Peter Shilton's caps record by a long way. He’s got a good chance of beating Shilton if he plays for another three to four years. If he doesn’t break it, it will be because of a horrible injury or a bizarre drop in form.

KEOWN: Playing deeper for United and the education from Van Gaal will extend his career. He can ping long passes like Paul Scholes used to and still be a threat in the final third. He can do it better than Scholes as he has extra pace.

CARRAGHER: Quite simply, he needs to keep scoring. There are very few players in the squad at the moment who look capable of scoring goals regularly at this level but Wayne always has the belief that he will go out and hit the target. If, for some reason, the goals begin to dry up, that is when questions about his performances and what he is contributing to the team will become more relevant.
