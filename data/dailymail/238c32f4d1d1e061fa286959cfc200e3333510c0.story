Hundreds of thousands of students will be hit by a marking boycott by academics amid a bitter row over pensions.

The University and College Union (UCU) said yesterday that industrial action will start across 69 UK institutions on Thursday.

Students will not be set coursework, receive formal marks or feedback on work. Any planned exams will also be brought to a halt.

The industrial action comes a week after the UCU announced that its members had backed industrial action in the row over pensions.

More than three-quarters (78 per cent) of those who voted in the recent ballot supported strikes, while 87 per cent were in favour of action short of walkouts, which includes the assessment boycott.

The union balloted members who are in the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) at 69 institutions. Turnout for the ballot was 45 per cent.

The dispute focuses on changes to the USS, which are understood to have been prompted by an expected deficit in the pension scheme.

UCU claims that the process used to work out the deficit is too simplistic and does not take into account the strengths of the scheme.

Talks were held between the union and employers’ representatives last week, but UCU insisted that these failed to provide them with a guarantee that employers were making an effort to protect the pensions of their members who are in the USS.

It added that more detailed negotiations are needed to solve the dispute.

UCU general secretary Sally Hunt said: ‘The employers failed to convince us of the need for their dramatic changes or the reasons behind the methodology for its deficit reduction plan.

‘Their proposals remain full of holes and the information they are apparently relying on to back them up keeps being exposed as misleading.

‘We are setting plans for an assessment boycott in place because USS members have made it clear they are unconvinced by the employers’ arguments as well.

‘We are being asked to buy a pig in a poke and that is simply not acceptable. We hope the employers will come back to the table for genuine negotiations aimed at resolving the enormous gap between our two positions.’

Universities UK has previously said it was ‘disappointed’ that UCU was threatening students with a boycott, adding that it believed the employers’ proposals are the best that could be achieved.
