Bullying victim: Emma Bailey, 34, who was repeatedly abused by youths in Stockport, Greater Manchester

Two schoolgirl bullies who waged a hate campaign against a woman with Down's syndrome were spared court action after they said sorry to the victim's mother.

The two 15-year-olds told Emma Bailey, 34, to 'go and die' during a campaign of abuse.

Emma, who has a mental age of about eight to ten years old, also opened her front door to her supported living accommodation to be confronted by youths hurling foul-mouthed abuse at her on another occasion.

The pair would also mimic Emma after spotting her dancing to her favourite CDs inside her home.

The victim later told her mother 
Eileen: 'They copy me, mum, they copy me. Why me like this mum? Why I 
handicapped? I don't like being handicapped.'

Police
were called in after one of Emma's three carers who visited her flat in 
Stockport, Greater Manchester, compiled a report about bullying.

The
two unnamed girls were later spoken to by police and agreed to meet 
Emma and her mother to apologise for their behaviour in exchange for not
being prosecuted.

The girls attended the meeting with their families under the Government's Restorative justice scheme.

Emma
decided at the last minute she was too upset to attend. A teenage boy 
who was part of the bullying gang wrote a letter of apology.

Ms Bailey, a retired clerk in her sixties, said: 'I told the girls about Emma 
repeatedly asking me, "Why me like this mum? Why I handicapped? I don't 
like being handicapped". They both seemed genuinely sorry for what they 
have done.

'Thankfully the torment has all stopped but the teasing had being going on for years.'

She added: 'Emma is a very friendly person. She likes to go out into the street talking to the children and their parents.

'But they were swearing at her and it would make her very distressed. They were throwing stones at the window and sticking their fingers up at her.

'Emma would tell me they were teasing her but I didn't realise how serious it was.'

'In June this year it escalated to the
point where three people knocked on Emma's door. There were three 
youths stood there and they swore at her using the F word. They called 
her a "f***ing mong" and told her to "go and die".

'Emma
got very angry. They ran off and she ran after them. Staff had to 
encourage Emma to come back and she pulled all the recycling bins over 
because she was that angry.

Anguish: Emma's mother Eileen Bailey told of the abuse that her daughter suffered at the hands of youths in her area. They have avoided prosecution after issuing an apology

'But it didn't stop there. Emma loves to listen to music. She has her own CDs and she loves to dance to them. They would mimic her dancing. She used to say to me, "They copy me, mum, they copy me".

Ms Bailey added that the girls had explained they had been drinking when they abused her.

She added: 'There were three people involved but one of them moved out of the district and therefore sent a letter of apology to Emma.

'The other two people came to meet me. They were two young ladies both aged 15. One was with her foster mother and one with her grandmother. Two police officers were also present.

'When I went into the room I told the girl how nervous I was. My stomach was churning. I'm sure that they were nervous too.

'We have clear evidence that restorative 
justice is keeping more and more - particularly young people - out of 
the criminal justice system. They are learning about doing right and 
wrong and, most importantly, once they have taken part in restorative 
justice they don't offend again'Â 

'It was quite informal and friendly. They told me they had been under the influence of alcohol and they thought it was fun to torment Emma.

'I gave the grandmother and the foster mother a copy of the report that had been written by the staff and told them they really had to realise how upsetting and distressing it was and how it made Emma feel.

'They have both written to Emma. One sent her a card with an apology in and the other one has written a letter with her apology, and Emma was very happy to receive those letters. It has made her a lot happier and to feel confident again.'

Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan at Greater Manchester Police said restorative justice allowed victims and crimes to meet up and resolve their problems.

'We try to offer victims the opportunity whenever it is right for them. Victims get closure. They get the opportunity to ask the questions that they don't get to ask in court,' he said.

'They get to face the person who caused them the harm and broke the law. They get to ask, "Why did you choose me? Why did you break the law?", and they get to hear answers to all their questions.

'We have clear evidence that restorative justice is keeping more and more - particularly young people - out of the criminal justice system. They are learning about doing right and wrong and, most importantly, once they have taken part in restorative justice they don't offend again.

'Restorative justice mainly deals with first time offenders. It's getting to them whilst they still have an opportunity to make a difference in their lives.'
