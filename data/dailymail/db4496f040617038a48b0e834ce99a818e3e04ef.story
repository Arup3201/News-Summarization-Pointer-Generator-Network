A British drug mule has been jailed for 10 years in Japan after the country's Supreme Court overturned an earlier acquittal.

Geologist Robert Geoffrey Sawyer, 56, claimed he did not know he was carrying 5.5lb of illegal stimulants - which have not been identified - in his luggage when he arrived at Tokyo's Narita Airport after a flight from Benin, Nigeria.

The about-turn of the verdict has cast a spotlight on Japan's recently-reformed legal system.

Lawyer's first trial was heard under what is known as the new 'lay judge system' in which a panel made up of members of the public take on the role of inquiring judges, guided by three professionals.

The judges, hearing how the stimulants were allegedly found in Sawyer's luggage when he arrived at Narita airport in 2010, found him not guilty, pointing out they could not be sure that he knew the package he was carrying contained drugs.

Prosecutors disagreed with the 'laymen's' verdict and took the case to the High Court, where Sawyer's acquittal was overturned.

Then the Supreme Court confirmed the High Court's decision, judges agreeing that Sawyer was a knowing drug mule and had almost certainly received directions from his handlers.

'A smuggling organisation usually gives a carrier instructions for how to return the luggage, regardless of whether or not it tells the person' that its contents were contraband, said the judges in a ruling posted on the Supreme Court's website.

The ruling added: 'The defendant had no company for the trip and no reservations for accommodation as of his arrival in Japan.

'He also says he had no plans to meet anyone and no itinerary while in Japan.

'It would not be easy for a smuggling organisation to collect stimulant drugs from a person displaying such behaviour.'

As well as being sentenced to 10 years imprisonment, Sawyer was fined five million yen (about Â£30,000).

The new law under which Sawyer was first acquitted was introduced in 2009 for certain serious convictions. Before then, crimes were heard by a panel of professionals with no provision for trial by a jury made up of members of the public.

The lay judge system has come under criticism for the powers that it holds.

It is able to decide on both the verdict and sentence - and on one occasion in 2010 handed down the death penalty to a defendant who was a minor under local law.
