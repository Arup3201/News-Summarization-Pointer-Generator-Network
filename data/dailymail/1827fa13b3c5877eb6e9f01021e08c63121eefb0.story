He created a storm when his ultra-flattering Moon and Galaxy dresses were worn by the likes of Victoria Beckham and Cameron Diaz.

And now, French designer Roland Mouret is set to cement his status as king of the killer dress with his debut bridal collection.

The White Collection, revealed by Vogue and stocked exclusively at online designer fashion outlet Net-A-Porter from today, puts a sexy spin on the traditional classic white gown.

'I wanted to create something that is about you and your partner, a one-to-one private relationship with the dress - not just something to please friends and family,' he said.

'I want my bridal dresses to be a bit sexier.'

Fashion blogger Lydia Faye Jones said of the range: 'Mouret has achieved a fashionably unique collection but has still kept in touch with the traditional qualities of a bridal gown. 

'The rich quality of fabrics and attention to detail is exquisite and will appeal to a modern female looking for a gown with a stylish twist.

Ranging in price from £1,600 for a a wool crepe cocktail-style dress to £4,100 for a draped lace gown, the collection is a mixture of classic whites and creams given a racy edge with Mouret's flourishes.

As an added touch, each garment comes complete with a message from Mouret wrapped with a moleskin bow.
