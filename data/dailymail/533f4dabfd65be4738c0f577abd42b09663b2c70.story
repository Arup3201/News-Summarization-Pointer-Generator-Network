Prosecutors plan to pursue the death penalty in the trial of Craig Hicks, 46 

The man who shot dead three Muslim students near the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill campus last month could be executed for the crime. 

Craig Hicks, 46, has been charged with first-degree murder in the February 10 shooting deaths of Deah Barakat, 23; his wife Yusor Abu-Salha, 21; and Yusor's sister Razan Abu-Salha, 19. 

Durham County District Attorney Roger Echols has expressed in court documents filed last week that the state plans to pursue capital charges in the case, which is currently being investigated as a possible hate crime by the FBI. 

Echols will explain his reasons for pursuing the death penalty at a hearing set for April.  

Prosecutors often push for the death penalty in cases where they can use execution as leverage to get the accused to agree to a plea deal, opting for a lesser sentence like life in prison for pleading guilt and avoiding trial. 

Hicks has reportedly already confessed to murder, though authorities still haven't revealed whether he gave a motive for his crime. 

His wife Karen Haggerty Hicks says he killed the three students because of an argument over parking spaces at the Finley  Forest apartments where they all lived just a few miles from the Chapel Hill campus.  

However,others have voiced the opinion that the shooting was a hate crime based on the students' Muslim faith.

Police say they found documents on Hicks' computer that show he kept detailed notes on the parking situation at the apartment complex.  

Hicks stands accused of shooting dead North Carolina students Deah Shaddy Barakat, 23, his wife Yusor Mohammad, 21, and her sister Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, 19, on February 10 

A search of Hicks' home turned up 12 firearms including four pistols and a Bushmaster AR-15.

He also described himself as a 'gun toting' atheist in online posts. 

Hicks faces three charges of first-degree murder as well as a charge of discharging a firearm into an occupied dwelling. 

The FBI is currently investigating the shooting to see if any federal laws against crimes of religious bias were broken. 

Hicks remains behind bars at Central Prison in Raleight, where he is reportedly  being kept in isolation for 'safe-keeping'.

He is being represented by a court-appointed public defender.
