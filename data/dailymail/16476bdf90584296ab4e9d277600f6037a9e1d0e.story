A Florida woman says that she was forced by police officers to defecate on her own front yard -- in front of them.

Dawn Brooks filed a complaint against Volusia County and the city of New Smyrna Beach for the police allegedly making her defecate on the lawn during a search for meth, Courthouse News Service reports.

In the complaint, Brooks claims that police officers handcuffed her and refused her request to use the bathroom somewhere else privately.

Instead, they allegedly said 'just use the restroom right there' referring to the front yard, which she did.

Cops also allegedly refused to help her clean up and dress herself. They also reportedly told Brooks to change into a plastic jumpsuit and to take her clothes off in the front yard.

The documents allege that police 'looked, yelled, and laughed at' Brooks as she was in various states of undress.

In the complaint, Brooks says that she could have used one of the restrooms in the house -- or could have 'used the restroom or gotten undressed and undressed' in a nearby police truck.

Brooks says the alleged incident caused her mental anguish and humiliation and that the police were not properly trained.

The claims were dismissed on March 14 when U.S. District Judge Roy Dalton did not find 'any allegation that deliberate indifference was responsible for the city's alleged failure to train,' Courthouse News Service says.

The court also said that Brooks did not show the need for training was 'plainly obvious,' based on prior instances.

It also said that Brooks failed to identify 'any specific practice or policy that caused the officers to infringe her rights.'

Brooks has until April 4 to amend her complaint.
