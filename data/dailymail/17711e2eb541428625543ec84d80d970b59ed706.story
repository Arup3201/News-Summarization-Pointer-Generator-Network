As many of us prepare to head abroad for summer holidays, many will be lamenting not starting their bikini diet months ago.

But if the prospect of stripping off on the beach leaves you in a cold sweat help is at hand.

Kayla Itsines, 23, from Adelaide, South Australia, has become an internet sensation with her bikini body guide earning her an astonishing one million Instagram followers, including Victoria’s Secret angel Candice Swanepoel.

The 23-year-old now has over one million followers on Instagram alone, all looking to achieve a body similar to hers

Kayla advocates consistency with both diet and exercise to achieve the best results

Kayla's workouts are all about high intensity circuits which focus on problem areas as well as burning as much fat as possible in the shortest time

With a body that would not look out of place on a catwalk, Kayla seems to have mastered the equation needed for an ultra slim and lean physique, coupled with a high level of fitness and strength without bulk.

Speaking with Femail, Kayla shares her personalized workouts and meal plan that can help you slim down fast in time for your holiday.

However she doesn’t advise crash dieting, which can ultimately lead you to pile the weight back on.

‘Girls so often fluctuate between taking their health seriously and not doing anything at all.

‘Nothing is worse for your body than 
constantly putting it through changes like this. This frequently is the 
cause of bloating, rapid weight gain or weight loss, emotional eating 
and disappointment. So find a simple plan and stick to it! Consistency 
is vital.’

1. ALWAYS eat breakfast. Even if you don’t necessarily feel like it! Having a good serve of protein, carbs and fats in the morning is the best way for you to start the day! You will have lots more energy to keep you going until lunch time.

2. Try to eat three main meals and two small snacks a day. I recommend spacing out your meals 2-3 hours in between each other for convenience. I always make sure I leave the house with two nutritious snacks. Almonds and grapes are my favourite as they are easy to carry in my bag and eat on the go! 

3. Take a multivitamin. Although you might feel like you are eating enough nutritious food everyday, our bodies can sometimes still lack vitamins. I take a multivitamin EVERY morning to help boost my immune system! 

4. Don’t be a afraid of carbs! Carbs are key for maximum energy, stamina, concentration, recovery and better fluid balance. They are so important for people who are working out regularly because they are the primary fuel for your body. Your brain is almost entirely fueled by carbohydrates, so its pretty important you eat them. Think of carbohydrates as the gas needed to fuel a car. Without gas, a car won't run. Likewise, without carbohydrates, your body will not have the fuel it requires to run through an entire day. Carbs are an essential part of your diet, just don’t eat too many.

Kayla’s pre-holiday workout consists of  targeted circuits which aim to work on specific ‘problem’ areas of the body while also burning calories.

Her diet plan aims to give you plenty of energy for her intense workouts, while reducing fat and calories to help you slim down.

And when it comes to food when you get to your destination, Kayla advises avoiding the traditional holiday binges.

‘I just returned from my first ever trip to Europe actually and my biggest piece of advice would definitely be to find a really good restaurant or café, that has healthy, cheap meals, and keep going back. There are so many places that both overcharge and provide some really bad versions of simple dishes. Find your favorite place/s for breakfast, lunch or dinner and keep using it.

‘As far as choosing what foods to eat, it’s pretty simple really. Do your best to follow your normal day at home. Anywhere in the world will have “similar” foods available for each meal. It’s just a matter of tailoring the slightly different options to suit your needs.’

On the beach, well tailored swimwear is essential to looking trim.

‘Wear a bikini that actually fits, especially around your bust. There is nothing worse than a bikini that is too big or too small. If you need help, take a friend shopping with you and get them to adjust sizes, as you need.

‘If you’ve got it, flaunt it! Wear a bikini to accentuate your beautiful body shape.'

This breakfast is high in protein and healthy fats to keep you full and energized through the day

Breakfast – Toast with poached eggs, avocado & tomato

My favorite breakfast is toast with poached eggs, avocado, and tomato. Plus, a cup of herbal tea. I love berry tea in the mornings. Having a good serve of protein, carbs and fats in the morning is a balanced way to start your day. It will give you lots of energy and strength to get you through the day.

Ingredients:•  2 slices of your choice of bread (I personally prefer rye bread)•  1 egg, poached – I like to have mine just a little bit runny•  A little bit of ripe avocado•  1 medium tomato, diced

Method:1. Mix avocado and tomato together. Spread on toasted bread. 2. Place poached egg on top. You can sprinkle some salt & pepper if you like too. 3. Bon Appetit!

Morning Snack 200g Tub of Low Fat Yogurt

Lunch – Cold rolls

Cold rolls are fantastic for a summertime lunch! They are so easy to make and you can use anything you like for the filling. I prefer vegetable cold rolls but you could always add some chicken (80g) for extra protein if you like.

Cold rolls make a tasty meal that is low in fat and calories

Ingredients:•  2 rice-paper wraps •  1/2 cup of carrot, peeled & grated•  1/2 cup of cucumber, peeled & sliced thinly •  1/4 cup cooked vermicelli noodles•  Soy sauce for dipping with chilli & lime (optional)

Method:

1. Pour warm water into a heatproof bowl until half full. Dip 1 rice paper wrapper in water. Place on a flat surface. Stand for 20 to 30 seconds or until soft enough to roll without splitting.2. Place vermicelli noodles along 1 edge of 1 wrapper. Top with carrot and cucumber. Fold in ends. Roll up firmly to enclose filling. Cover with a damp tea towel to prevent roll drying out. Repeat with remaining filling. Serve with some soy sauce for dipping.

Dinner - Warm Turkey Salad

It’s winter in Australia right now but during summer, I love warm turkey (or chicken), avocado and pumpkin salad, with a little bit of olive oil and cracked pepper dressing.

Filling and tasty this turkey salad will fill you up without effecting your waistline

Ingredients:•  1 cup green leafy salad mix •  80g of cooked turkey (or chicken)•  25g of avocado •  1/2 cup of cooked pumpkin •  Handful of bagel crisp breads 

Method: 1. Combine ingredients and toss through2. Add pine nuts (if desired) or some low calorie dressing and enjoy!

Fresh orange juice gives you plenty of vitamins

Ice Cold Orange Juice

After spending a day out in the sun, I love coming home and cooling down with a glass of zesty, fresh orange juice with HEAPS of ice-cubes.

Ingredients (serves 2): •  2 Oranges, peeled (optional to peel)•  1 Lemon, peeled (optional to peel)•  1-inch piece of Ginger, peeled•  4-8 carrots, ends trimmed (to flavour)

Method:1.Push ingredients through a juicer2.Pour into a glass, add some ice cubes and enjoy. Easy!
