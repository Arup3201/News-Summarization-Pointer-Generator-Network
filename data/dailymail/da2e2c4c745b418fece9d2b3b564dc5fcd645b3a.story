Daily Mail feature writer Harry Mount emulates P.G.Wodehouse by throwing letters out of his window in the hope that passers-by would drop them in the post box

To find the most trustworthy people in Britain, head for Cornwall and Wales. So I’ve discovered, after carrying out an experiment invented by P.G. Wodehouse a century ago.

I left 20 stamped envelopes addressed to my North London flat across the country — on pub tables, in cathedrals and beneath town hall porches — to see if anyone would post them.

The results varied enormously according to region. As a born-and-bred Londoner, I’m ashamed to say only two out of the seven letters I left in prominent places in the capital — from the Houses of Parliament to the British Museum — made it home.

Neither of the letters I left in Bristol, including one in Bristol Cathedral, were posted. But two out of three of the letters left in Cornwall completed the trip.

And only one region had a 100 per cent success record . . . Wales.

The further you get from the booming capital — with its soaring house prices, low unemployment and, it seems, a distracted population — the more likely the locals are to walk a few hundred yards to the nearest postbox on behalf of a stranger.

Wodehouse cooked up the idea when he was staying with his parents in their house in Royal Crescent, Cheltenham, where they lived from 1902 until 1921.

It was while watching the cricket at Cheltenham in 1913 that he was taken by the name of a Warwickshire bowler called Percy Jeeves, and the comic writer’s greatest creations, Jeeves and Wooster, were born.

It was also while staying in Cheltenham that Wodehouse came up with another brilliant comic invention.

He was so convinced by the good character of the British people that he never bothered posting his letters.

Instead, he stamped and addressed them, and simply flung them out of the window of the house, in the heart of the pretty Gloucestershire spa town.

‘Someone always picks it up,’ Wodehouse said. ‘And it saves me going down four flights of stairs every time I want to mail a letter.’

Last month, a local Cheltenham paper, the Gloucestershire Echo, revived Wodehouse’s theory to see whether it had passed the test of time. He would have been delighted to see how honest Cheltenham’s residents remain.

Of the 18 letters left — in phone boxes, on window ledges and bins, in bus stops and on benches, cafe and pub tables — 15 were posted and delivered to the newspaper. That’s a success rate of 83 per cent.

Extending the Wodehouse experiment around the country, I have to report more disappointing results. Of the 20 letters I left, nine were returned — or 45 per cent of the total, with that percentage soaring the closer that you got to Britain’s western extremities.

I began in London, on Millbank, in the shadow of the Houses of Parliament. I left the letter on the window ledge of a building next to the hallowed home of British democracy.

It is no ordinary building — it is home to the political studios of Sky News and the BBC. Every day,  dozens of journalists, MPs and peers whizz through its revolving doors to broadcast their views to the nation.

Who could poss-ibly be more trustworthy than politicians and the BBC? Yes, of course, that’s a rhetorical question. Letter number one never arrived.

Thank God — literally — for the fate of letter number two. I left this one outside Westminster Abbey’s Great West Door, in the shadow of the Abbey’s gift shop.

As good as gold, a saintly Dean of Westminster or passing tourist popped it in the nearest letterbox.

Another letter, left by a friend outside a bakery in North London’s Brent Cross shopping centre, also made the short trip to my house. Otherwise, I’m afraid, my native London behaved in a less than ideal way.

The results varied enormously according to region. Only two out of the seven letters I left in prominent places in the capital ¿ from the Houses of Parliament to the British Museum ¿ made it home

The letter left on a table outside the Museum Tavern, the pub opposite the world-renowned  British Museum? It never arrived.

Neither did the one left beneath  Admiralty Arch, at the other end of the Mall from Buckingham Palace. Nor did the one left in the shelter  of the porch of St Martin-in- the-Fields, the stately church  overlooking Trafalgar Square.

On New Year’s Day, my nephew left me a letter in the cafe in the Upper Tier of the East Stand at Arsenal’s Emirates Stadium during their 2-0 win over Cardiff.

A great day for Arsenal fans — not such a great one for the trust-worthiness of the British people. It hasn’t made the two-mile journey to my Kentish Town flat.

I headed out of London, away from the frantic, dog-eat-dog world of the capital.

First, I left a letter outside the gates of the Senate House in Cambridge, where degree ceremonies are held for the university’s students.

It turns out Cambridge isn’t just one of Britain’s cleverest cities — it’s also one of the friendliest.

The letter came through  my letterbox a few days later, with  a nice inscription on its back  in capital letters: ‘FOUND ON  CAMBRIDGE STREET!’

Taking the train a little further north, I didn’t fare so well in the enchanting cathedral city of Ely. I left my letter there in the southern porch of the cathedral, by the remains of the old cloisters. Nothing came back.

However, moving north into Lincolnshire, I had another positive result.

I left my letter on the outside shelf of the bookshop on Steep Hill, the enchanting ancient street leading up to Lincoln Cathedral. It arrived at my home on January 6.

In nearby Newark, things were better still. Here I experienced the quickest of all my deliveries.

At midday, I left my letter leaning against a Doric pillar in Newark’s charming 18th-century town hall.

By 4.01pm, it had been postmarked by the Royal Mail, and was speeding on its way down south to the mat in my front hall. Cheltenham, home to Wodehouse’s original experiment, didn’t fare too well.

I left a letter in the porch of the  town hall — a short stroll from Wodehouse’s parents’ house in Royal Crescent, and an even shorter stroll from the nearest postbox. Nothing came back.

P.G. Wodehouse was so convinced by the good character of British people he never bothered posting his letters. Instead, he simply flung them out of the window

Perhaps the residents have grown tired of posting each other’s letters.

The two letters I left in Bristol weren’t winners either. I placed one on a monk’s stone seat in the  historical 12th-century chapter house of the cathedral. As far as I know, it’s still there today.

The same goes for the letter I left in a phone box overlooking Brunel’s Clifton Suspension Bridge.

I know people depend on their mobiles these days but, surely, they still nip into the odd phone box to make the occasional emergency call — if not to post a letter.

Then came the staggering, heartening results that restored my faith in the Great British Public. My mother left a letter on the street in Pembroke, just outside Wisebuys grocers.

Back it whizzed to my letterbox. A hundred per cent for Wales!

Friends of mine travelling through Cornwall over New Year were equipped with letters that must have been impregnated with magic pixie dust.

First, they left a letter propped up between the condiments jars on the dining table of the Weavers’ Arms in Bodmin. That came flying back to my house.

Another, left on the floor of the old Bodmin Jail, now a tourist site, didn’t make it — perhaps the ghosts of the jail’s former inhabitants nicked it.

That stray letter apart, my friends had an excellent record. Another letter left on the streets of Saltash, Cornwall, also came back.

Driving home, they dropped a  letter in the car park of an M5  service station in Somerset.

That one not only returned, but a kind motorist had also written on  the back: ‘Found this letter  dropped at Sedgemoor Services (M5). Merry Christmas!’

By this stage, my friends were so enriched with goodwill that, when they tried to leave a letter at the Barge Inn in Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire, where they had been staying, they didn’t stand a chance.

The huge-hearted landlady rang them up to ask whether they’d left a letter behind, hidden under some cushions on a sofa.

The British Good Samaritan is alive and well, then. But, if you want to find him — or her — go west.
