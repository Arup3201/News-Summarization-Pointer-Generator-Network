Atletico Madrid will try to re-sign Chelsea defender Filipe Luis at the end of the season and hope his lack of opportunities at Stamford Bridge persuade him to push for a return to the Spanish capital.

Atletico saw three players leave the club for Chelsea last summer but despite attention focusing on how they would replace the goals of Diego Costa and the saves of Thibaut Courtois, Luis has been the most difficult to replace.

Guilherme Siqueira has struggled for form and the Argentine Cristian Ansaldi has spent most of the season injured.

Ansaldi was also arrested after a defeat to Barcelona earlier in the year when he slammed a policeman’s hand in his car after an argument about access to the stadium.

Diego Simeone will use veteran right-back Jesus Gamez out of position at left back in Atletico's Champions League second-leg clash with Bayer Leverkusen but has asked the club’s owners about the possibilities of bringing back Luis.

The 29-year-old has failed to settle in London without regular first team football because of competition from Cesar Azpilicueta and Branislav Ivanovic.

Luis has made just 22 appearances for Chelsea so far this season and not played in the four games following the Blues' 1-1 draw with Burnley last month. 

Atletico manager Diego Simeone hopes Luis will push for a move back to his former club in the summer
