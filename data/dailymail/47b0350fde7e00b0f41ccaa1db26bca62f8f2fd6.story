More people have voted early in at least 10 states than in 2010, as Republicans make the final push to control the Senate in midterm elections.

Nationally at least 16.4 million ballots have been cast early in 31 states and women make up 55 percent of this vote, two points higher than 2010.

The race between Democratic Senator Kay Hagan and Republican challenger Thom Tillis in North Carolina is one of the most fiercely fought contests that will decide who takes control of the Senate.

Registered Democrats in the state have out-voted registered Republicans by almost 16 percentage points through Sunday, casting 47.6 percent of the 1.15 million early ballots. 

The overall total is up by almost 200,000 votes from 2010.

Ben Ray, a spokesman for the Democrats' joint campaign office in North Carolina, said the gap exceeds Democrats' nine-point advantage at this point in 2010. 

The raw numbers also give Democrats reason for optimism, as both blacks and women make up a larger share of the early vote than in 2010, when Republicans swept statewide races in the state.

Blacks, who support Mr Hagan by an overwhelming margin, have cast about a quarter of the early vote, compared to 21 percent in 2010. Women have cast 55 percent, two points higher than 2010.

But Republicans say they also faced a 16-point early voting gap in 2012, but rallied on Election Day to give Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney a two-point win over President Barack Obama. 

GOP spokesman Michael Short said Democrats 'are going into a hostile Election Day scenario without the margin they wanted.'

About 16 percent of early North Carolina voters - 183,523 so far according to an analysis by Democrats -  did not vote four years ago. 

Mr Ray said just more than half are Democrats, while almost 26 percent are Republicans and the rest are unaffiliated.

Nationally, at least 16.4 million ballots have been cast in 31 states, according to a tally conducted by The Associated Press. 

The figures include in-person early voting and mail-in ballots that have been returned.

Four years ago, 26.9 million out of 89 million overall votes, or about 30 percent, were cast away from traditional precincts.

Along with North Carolina, the states included Arkansas, Georgia, Florida, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, Montana, Utah and Wisconsin.

In Iowa 21,200 registered Republicans have voted earlier compared to 8,500 Democrats, increasing the chances of Joni Ernst becoming elected. 

Voting almost entirely by mail for the first time, registered Republicans have an 9-point lead over registered Democrats in returned ballots in Colorado. 

Louisiana had the largest proportional increase of any state with early turnout 181 percent of its 2010 figure.

Registered Democrats have a 19-point advantage, compared to 4.4 points in 2010. But Republican Sen. David Vitter still won that year by almost 19 percentage points. 

Georgia voters don't register by party, but African-Americans have accounted for about a third of the early votes, higher than the 2010 midterms and the 2012 presidential election.   

With early voting about a quarter higher than four years ago in Florida registered Republicans have a 4.3-point advantage over registered Democrats as GOP Gov. Rick Scott seeks a second term.
