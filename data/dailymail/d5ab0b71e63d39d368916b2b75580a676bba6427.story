Can you Adam and Eve it? Cockney rhyming slang is being driven out by a new language sweeping across the country.

The hybrid dialect, which, like cockney, combines slang with a different pronunciation, has been dubbed Multicultural London English by linguistic researchers.

It was originally nicknamed Jafaican - fake Jamaican - but scientists have now said it is a dialect that been influences by West Indian, South Asian, Cockney and Estuary English.

Popularised: Actor Idris Elba, left, and rapper Dizzee Rascal, right, helped spread MLE even further

Paul Kerswill, professor of socio-linguistics at York University, said: ‘There are two things going on: youth slang, which a lot of people use.

‘But there are [also] core users of MLE and to them it is a dialect and an accent. It doesn’t have to have slang in it.

‘It’s a new kind of Cockney in a way.’

Rap artists such as Dizzee Rascal and Hackney-born actor Idris Elba have helped to popularise the dialect in the UK.

Though much of the slang is Afro-American or Jamaican in origin - with words such as ‘blud’ meaning friend and ‘ends’ meaning neighbourhood - the pronunciation is often not.

In MLE ‘like’ is pronounced ‘lahke’, but this ‘ah’ sound in place of the ‘i’ is not West Indian.

Mr Kerswill told the Sunday Times: ‘It is an extension of just using the slang.

Blud (friend)Cotch (relax)Creps (trainers)Endz (neighbourhood)Bare (very)

‘All of these features have arisen out of the huge mix of languages and accents heard in some parts of London. This means they are home-grown.

‘It’s the slang that gives it a Caribbean or American feel and its use in British hip-hop adds to this impression, too.’

Like cockney, MLE users will omit or replace certain letters in words. The letters ‘th’ are usually replaced by an ‘f’ or ‘v’, as in ‘fink’ or ‘muvver’.

But unlike cockney, MLE users do not drop their aitches.

The language is often picked up at a young age, and particularly in schools where 50 per cent of pupils have English as a second language.

Variants of MLE have also emerged in multicultural cities such as Birmingham and Manchester, Mr Kerswill said: ‘A lot of the core speakers are in the East End of London, where they have low opportunities, and so one of the mechanisms when people find themselves unable to make progress in life or [are] discriminated against is to speak differently, to use that as an exclusionary strategy.’
