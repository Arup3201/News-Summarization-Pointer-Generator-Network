Milly Dowler’s killer has won £4,500 compensation after being attacked in prison.

Levi Bellfield, 45, received the payout despite suffering only minor cuts. The triple-killer has told friends that he will give the cash to his mother for rent on a holiday caravan in Kent.

Bellfield won the compensation after being attacked by an inmate with a makeshift weapon at Wakefield prison in Yorkshire in 2009.

The burly former nightclub bouncer suffered minor injuries but took prison bosses to court, claiming they should have protected him.

Ministry of Justice lawyers fought for three years to stop Bellfield, jailed in 2011 for 13-year-old Milly’s murder, from receiving a penny off taxpayers.

But on Wednesday he was awarded the cash at Durham County Court after the Ministry of Justice was forced to admit full liability.

A ministry spokesman said: ‘We are hugely disappointed that Levi Bellfield was awarded £4,500 by a judge following an assault by a  prisoner in 2009 at HMP Wakefield.’ A source close to Bellfield’s family told The Mirror: ‘Levi will transfer the funds to relatives. He wants them to use it on the caravan.

‘He’s angry that prison guards let him in that part of the prison. He says by putting him in that wing, it was just asking for an attack to happen.  Another inmate waited for him outside one of the bathrooms. The inmate went for his eye with a weapon but missed. It was pretty tame.’

Labour MP Ian Austin last night pledged to raise the compensation payout with Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, saying it was ‘disgusting’. 

He said: ‘This is a complete and utter disgrace. I will be asking Mr Grayling how this evil child  murderer could possibly be awarded such a huge sum of money. Every right-thinking person will agree this is distasteful and wrong.’

National Victims’ Association founder David Hines added: ‘It really gets us that murderers claim for being attacked and get rewards. It’s a sin.’

Victims: Bellfield got a whole life term in 2008 for the murders of Amelie Delagrange (left), 22, and 19-year-old Marsha McDonnell (right)

Bellfield got a whole life term in 2008 for the murders of Amelie Delagrange, 22, and 19-year-old Marsha McDonnell.

He kidnapped Milly in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, in 2002.

He lured her back to his flat as she walked home from school, killed her and dumped her body in a remote wood where he used to walk his dog. The body was only found six months later.

Police mistakes allowed Bellfield to avoid capture and he went on to stalk and murder two young women and tried to kill a third before he was arrested.

The news of the payout is likely to add to the distress of the Dowler family. Speaking after Bellfield’s conviction, Milly’s mother Sally said: ‘The length the system goes to protect his human rights seems so unfair compared to what we as a family have had to endure.’

Mrs Dowler said she hoped Bellfield would be dealt with in jail with the ‘same brutality’ he used against his victims.
