Ferry services between England and France are suffering severe disruption due to a 24-hour industrial action in northern France.

The Port of Calais is closed after local staff went on a wild-cat strike, blocking roads leading to the port and making it impossible to unload ferries.

An estimated 70 to 80 dock workers and crane drivers are on strike since midnight Thursday, following an industrial dispute between port authorities and the union.

Ferry services are being disrupted in both directions and passengers are being advised to contact their operator before travelling.

The industrial dispute between the CGT union and regional authorities springs from the decision to bring in contracted workers to unload ferries at Calais.

‘There is not much work for dockers and crane operators anyway and in a region where there is 18 per cent unemployment this is unacceptable,' a union spokesperson told The Local.

Roads leading into the Port of Calais are blocked, leading to long traffic jams where reportedly several school buses heading to the UK are stuck.

Local firefighters had to come to the rescue to a bus of British schoolchildren where several had taken ill or were in need of a bathroom.

P&O ferries warned that they will be running a limited service until further notice and urge passengers to consider other travel dates

French fireservices were able to escort the bus out of the jam towards the Channel Tunnel rail link, a local newspaper reported.

Freight traffic is also starting to clog the roads leading to the port in Dover, Kent a spokesman for the Port of Dover said.

As a result, Operation Stack could be implemented ‘imminently’ to hold freight on the coastbound carriageway of the M20 and alleviate the build-up of traffic.

A Port of Dover spokesman said: ‘We will continue to monitor the situation closely in liaison with our ferry partners and the Port of Calais in order to resume normal operations as soon as possible.

‘Please note that there may be delays to services when the Port of Calais reopens. We apologise for any delays or inconvenience as a result of the industrial action in France.’

P&O ferries warned that they will be running a limited service until further notice.

‘We strongly recommend that if your travel is not essential that you rebook for an alternate date,’ the company said in a statement.

The company said much of traffic from the UK to France has been directed to the Eurotunnel, and that the most severe disruptions regard the way from the continent to Dover.

The Port of Dunkirk remains open.
