A mother has spoken about the horrifying moment when her phone charger exploded and parts of it hit the moses basket where her five-week-old baby was sleeping.

Donna Senior had bought the charger for her iPhone a few days earlier, but after plugging it in for the first time, she and her newborn daughter Ella were awoken by a loud bang in the early hours of the morning.

Half of the phone charger had come away from the plug socket, leaving the connection in the wall black and frazzled.

The charger, which can be used for iPhones, exploded in the middle of the night and hit a moses basket

Mrs Senior, a primary school support assistant from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, said: 'It just blew up, it was terrifying. I nearly jumped out my skin.

'It was dark in the room as it was the middle of the night and I didn’t dare look round for a minute as I didn’t have a clue what had happened.

'My little girl Ella has colic and so we are sleeping in the living room together so not to wake everyone else up during the night.

'When the charger came away from the wall it hit her moses basket, I’m surprised the whole thing didn’t go up.'

Mrs Senior, 30, bought the £8 charger from The Phone Shop in Huddersfield Bus Station, West Yorkshire, on December 20, but didn’t use it until New Years Eve.

However when she returned it to the shop with the blown-up charger and explained what happened, a shop worker refused to give her a refund and instead offered her a replacement.

'They didn’t seem to care what had happened, even when I explained that my baby had been in the room,' said Mrs Senior.

'It was only £8 so I wasn’t that bothered about the money, but it was more about principle. The man working there tried to sell me another one which "had been tested", but there was no way I was going to trust another one from them.

'It could have been a completely different story, both of us could have been killed.'

A spokesman from The Phone Shop said: 'We have been contacted by Trading Standards regarding this matter and we are currently making enquiries.

'All of our products are tested by the manufacturer before they go on sale because we do not want to tell anything which is faulty, and we are very sorry to hear what has happened to this lady.

'If she can provide a receipt for the charger, we will of course provide her with a full refund.'

Tony Downham, of West Yorkshire Trading Standards Service, said they would be investigating the incident at Mrs Senior’s home.

He said: 'There have been reports of house fires in London and the south east due to this sort of thing.'

The Revive A1299 USB charger is still on sale at The Phone Shop.
