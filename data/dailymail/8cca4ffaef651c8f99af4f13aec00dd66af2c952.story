From a rare and adorable bald bonobo nursing on his mum to a furry baby just happy to play in a pile of straw, these pint-sized apes will one day be powerful creatures. 

But for the moment they are little bundles of joy.

Newborn-obsessed photographer and animal handler Sonja Probst, 46, from Bavaria took a 3,600 mile whirlwind tour of zoos in Germany and Tenerife to capture her extraordinary images.

'I love to show the similarity between the primates and us humans,' she said. 'The adult apes raise their children, protect and teach them just like we do.

'But we can also see how their offspring can be mischievous just like our little ones.

 'I try to capture the individual nature of each animal, but it is the helpless ones that pull at my heart strings.

'These are the ones that are just so cute and helpless.'

Apes are our closest animal relatives, with some such as chimpanzees, sharing up to 97 per cent of our genetic makeup with humans.

However, they are under threat in the wild, with their forest homes facing destruction thanks to the logging of trees for wood.

'These animals should be appreciated, respected and preserved,' said Sonja. 'They have feelings and sensations just as we do.

'I try to make my pictures show the apes' vulnerability and the beauty.

'I hope they touch people's hearts.'
