IT has just sold for over half a million pounds – more than double the average British home.

So you might be expecting to see something with a little grandeur.

But this property is actually a dilapidated garage, and justifies its hefty price tag by being in the upmarket borough of Chelsea. 

This dilapidated old shed in Chelsea has been snapped up for £550,000 before it had a chance to go under the hammer

The shed has become the nation's most expensive lockup after selling for three times the average value of a British home

The ramshackle unit is tucked behind a row of terraced houses and doesn’t even have access for a car.

Described as an ‘irregularly shaped, broadly level site’, the plot is just 538 square feet – but was snapped up by an investor even before going under the hammer.

It was supposed to be sold off by Allsop auctioneers yesterday, but was bought in advance for close to the asking price of £550,000.

The site – near Chelsea’s famous King’s Road – comes with planning permission for an unusual two-bedroom home with a single storey at ground level and a basement.

Once complete, one of the bedrooms will have an en suite bathroom, while there will also be a living room, kitchen, a ‘green’ roof and a patio. However it could arguably be called a bargain, as the average home on the street costs £3.5million – up £507,000 in the last year, and £1.1million since 2009.

The unique new home, which sits on a site measuring 0.013 acres, will feature two bedrooms, one of which will have an ensuite

Recent figures from the Office for National Statistics show house prices in the capital have risen by more than 20 per cent in the last year, with the average London home now costing £514,000.

By contrast, the average price for the UK as a whole is £274,000.

The soaring costs mean that only those earning more than £100,000 a year can afford a typical mortgage in the city, according to the National Housing Federation.

The garage is located on land behind these houses. It is to be demolished to make way for a small new home

And the sale of the shed is just the latest in a string of extraordinary property deals.

Last month, a flat in Islington measuring just 188 square feet – less than half the size of a train carriage – was sold for more than a quarter of a million pounds.

The tiny property is so compact that the front door opens underneath the bed, which is on a mezzanine. Estate agents said it received a huge amount of interest before selling for £275,000.
