A picture is definitely worth a thousand words, especially in this mesmerising new time-lapse video showing a century of beauty in Korea.

In the latest 100 Years of Beauty film,  model Tiffany Lee is given makeovers showcasing the trends of each decade between 1910 and 2010.

The fast-changing video shows the elaborate looks worn early last century from intricate woven looks to carefully styled curls - and how political change influenced styles.

The first look in the video shows Korean model Tiffany, at a time when Korea was first under Japanese rule

During this time, women preferred ornamented hairstyles and minimal make-up

What is truly captivating is the manner in which the styles mirror the economic, political and social disparity in the country during the respective decades.

Between the 1910s and 1940s, the video captures how women copied beauty trends from Japan, such as ornamented hairstyles, and emulated Western trends such as finger curls from the flapper era. 

The trends continue until the clip reaches the 1950s where the screen splits into two, to reflect the historical division of Korea into separate states (North and South), during the Second World War.  

In 1945, Korea was divided into two spheres of influence, during which America controlled South Korea, and Russia installed a Communist regime in North Korea, later surrendering power to China.

In the Fifties, following the divide of the country, South Korea showed an understated appropriation of Western trends with TIffany wearing lightly rouged cheeks, scarlet lips and a styled quiff.

But in North Korea, women were fresh-faced, hair was scraped back and the model is shown wearing a military cap, which signals the beginning of repression under the Communist regime.

Under the Japanese colonial rule, Koreans preferred to emulate Japanese beauty trends, which in the Twenties included pinned hair and fresh-faced make-up

In the 1930s, Korea was still very much emulating Japanese beauty trends, such as matte red lips and hats

The video is the latest in a series by Cut.com, which created two demonstrations of 100 years of American beauty as well as a film that revealed the dramatic changes in female beauty  in Iran over the last century.

The latest installment in the series reveals how South Korea's trends continued in line with the western beauty after the Second World War and beyond.

But  in North Korea, women's styles reflected huge political upheavals and government propaganda, with women donning humble peasant hats, modes headscarves and Army caps.

The American trend of finger curls were worn by style-conscious Korean women in the Forties

In the Fifties, Korea is divided into two states - the trends reflect that America controlled the South, and Russia created a communist state in North Korea

By the time it was the Swinging Sixties made it to  Korea, the divide between the beauty norms in the neighbouring countries was obvious.

The South, very much focused on capitalism, appropriating glamorous trends from the US or Japan.

This is depicted by the berry-pink lips, pencilled-in brows and dark,  bouffant-styled hair with a dramatic side-parting. 

Tiffany blows kisses alluding to female freedom and a growing sexualisation.

On the other hand, the looks for North Korean women of the same time involves wearing wearing a bandanna, synonymous with labourers at the time.

The Sixties shows a wide disparity in beauty ideals, with South looking to American trends and the North sticking with Communist ideologies

North Korea's Communist regime meant that women were encouraged to be labourers. This is what was considered beautiful at the time and propaganda from the time emphasised this

While North Korea  focuses on women as labourers and providers, South Korea follows American trends freely

This portrayal was created by the Communist ideologies in the North: propaganda at the time highlighted the belief that dressed-down, healthy and hardworking women were considered beautiful. 

Tiffany even has freckles pencilled in, showing her exposure to the sun as a worker.

The Seventies similarly saw South Korea following American trends, as the model showcases garish earrings, a stylish bandanna, winged eyeliner and a beehive.

But in  North Korea, Tiffany is depicted in a worker's straw hat, and seen wiping sweat off her brow.

The styling reflects the diktats that were less about vanity, but more about what a person could contribute to society - this longstanding belief is shown by the fact that the make-up trends are pretty much unchanging in North Korea from the Fifties until the Nineties.

The Eighties were still seeing South Korea's preoccupation with following capitalist trends, as shown by Tiffany's appropriation of the 'techno' trend.

In the 1990s, the North saw a widespread famine, bringing economic hardship to an already repressive regime

While South Korean women made sure their hair was as big as possible, slapped on pink eyeshadow, pink lipstick and matching blusher, their northern counterparts wore simple bobs and kept their faces largely make-up free. 

In the Nineties, South Korea fell victim to the techno trend, shown by the use of fake eyelashes, wild teased bunches and neon clips in the hair. Tiffany is shown joyfully dancing and pouting in a playful manner. 

The 1990s saw a widespread famine for North Korea,  which saw around one million people die of starvation. 

This explains Tiffany's sombre expression; the hair is sleek and pulled down into a modest ponytail, and the make-up is subtle.

The Noughties saw the South continue on its glamorous trajectory while the North was slowly recovering from the famine and laid a focus on nuclear weaponry and industry

In the 2010s, North Korea has shown gradual social progress and freedom for women, shown by Tiffany's increased use of make-up and accessories. The South have continued appropriating Western trends

In 1992 Kim Jong Il began to take over North Korea, and instituted a policy whereby the military was emphasised above all aspects of society and dominated resources. 

North Korea conducted its first nuclear test, and travel restrictions were tightened. Security surrounding the country was also strengthened - all leading to a highly repressive way of life, where many people are denied basic human rights.

This is shown in the video where the Noughties continue on its glamorous trajectory, but Tiffany in North Korea sees a return to the days where women sport military gear.

As time went on, South Korea became an industrial powerhouse and women were able to campaign for legal equality and became increasingly independent. 

This is shown by Tiffany's freedom in terms of her physical appearance: sporting tanned skin, garish jewellery and glamorous make-up, as well as pouting  in a sensual manner.

At this time, North Korean beauty ideals are shown to still be very subtle and modest in the Noughties, but there are slight advancements in terms of hair accessories, and relatively minimal make-up with small dabs of eye shadow and slightly glossed lips.
