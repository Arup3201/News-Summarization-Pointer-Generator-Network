The FBI has identified two people who were shot outside the National Security Agency's headquarters on Monday after allegedly stealing an SUV they were driving from a motel.

Kevin Lamont Fleming, 20, and his friend Ricky 'Maya' Shawatza Hall, 27, were allegedly picked up in Baltimore by another man on Sunday night before 'partying' at nearby lodgings in Howard County.

The unidentified 60-year-old Baltimore driver went to the bathroom on Monday morning and discovered that both his passengers and his Ford Escape SUV had gone, he told police.

Hall, the driver who identifies as a woman, allegedly took the SUV onto NSA grounds shortly after and refused police commands to halt.

The driver and passenger, who were both dressed as women and have criminal records, were subsequently shot by a guard outside the facility.

The Ford Escape is thought to have been stolen from the Terrace Motel in Elkridge, Maryland, where Hall and Fleming went with an unidentified 60-year-old man early Monday morning to 'party'

Members of the Baltimore transvestite community said that Hall lived in an abandoned apartment in the city and noted that something had been off about her behavior recently

Hall, identified by the FBI Tuesday, died at the scene, though police have not said how she died.

Her lawyer said that Hall was a transgender individual who identified as a woman and had a long criminal record, according to the Wall Street Journal. 

She had previous convictions for armed robbery, assault, theft and prostitution. 

The prostitution conviction was from 2007, according to court records. She received a year's probation.

She had also been charged with stealing a bottle of methadone from a woman's pocket last year. 

Baltimore City public defender said 'He’s a young man with a very, very troubled past,' and had an upcoming parole violation hearing in July that could have sent her to prison her several years.

Members of Baltimore's transvestite community said that she lived in an abandoned apartment building in Baltimore with other transvestites, according to Wbal-Tv.

'I'm sure that they didn't leave their house knowing that they wouldn't come home that day or that that would be the end, Jamia Leonard, who had known Hall for eight months, said.

It was not immediately clear if Hall and Fleming had been living in the same house.

Leonard said that something had been off with Hall's behavior recently.  

"In the last couple of days, I knew something was wrong. I didn't know exactly what was going on but I could hear him talking out of his head.'

'He would travel from this abandoned house to another high-rise right down the street back and forth, and back and forth.'

Hall had a previous conviction for prostitution though police could not say if there was any sex at the motel. Above, a brown wig (circled) can be seen outside the stolen Ford SUV that the suspects were driving

Fleming remains in a hospital after being flown there with serious injuries, while an NSA police officer was also wounded and released from the hospital Monday. 

He was awaiting a probation violation hearing in June in Anne Arundel County.

The young man was also suspected of stealing a tip jar worth $100.99 and was sentenced to probation and fined.

The reason for his probation violation arrest on March 9 was not immediately clear, according to the Washington Post. He was released on March 25

Information about what happened at the Terrace Motel, in Elkridge, Maryland, less than 20 minutes from the NSA gates, is not contained in the Howard County police report about the incident.

'We can't confirm there was any sexual activity involved,' a police spokeswoman said of Hall and Fleming's time in the motel.

Their 60-year-old driver told police that the trio wanted to 'party' and that they checked into the motel about 7.30am, according to police.

The car, which was reported stolen at 8.30am, belonged to the driver's wife. 

The 60-year-old was a regular at the motel, according to WJZ.

An employee of the Terrace Motel would not confirm any details of the case to Daily Mail Online. 

It is unclear how the men ended up at the government building, which is off of a highway exit clearly marked as a restricted area for NSA employees only.

The incident sparked terrorism fears at the heavily secured area on Fort Meade in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, on Monday morning.

The men are said to have panicked and refused police commands to stop when they strayed on to the highly secretive government property, police said. 

The NSA checkpoint where the shooting occurred is directly off the busy Highway 295 between Washington, DC and Baltimore. Authorities believe that Fleming and Hall may have gotten off on the exit accidentally

A man in the area said that Hall and Fleming were screaming loudly as they rushed toward the NSA gate. 

They were apparently warned several times to halt.

Authorities have speculated that cocaine and a weapon found in the car may have played a role in the vehicle not stopping. 

When the SUV accelerated, the guard opened fire - killing Hall and gravely wounding Fleming.

The vehicle slammed into a police SUV blocking the road, and injured the officer.

An FBI spokesman said that no information about motive would be released on Tuesday, according to the Baltimore Sun.

Fleming and Hall's dressing as women is not believed to be part of any attempt to disguise themselves. 

The suspects are thought to have fled down the highway from the Elkridge motel and authorities believe they may have ended up on Fort Meade property by mistake. 

Cocaine and a weapon found in the stolen SUV, which belonged to the 60-year-old man's wife, may have played a role in the car refusing to stop 

The SUV was warned several times to stop before a guard opened fire and the vehicle crashed into the police car

The 44-year-old NSA police officer and Fleming were both transported to the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore, WTTG-TV reported. 

Pictures from the scene show what appears to be the crashed Ford Escape and a police SUV outside the gates to the military post.

A  body can be seen covered by a white sheet next to the black SUV.

What appears to be a curly brown wig is seen beside the car.

Fort Meade is home to several highly sensitive government agencies, including the NSA - the spy agency responsible for controversial mass surveillance programs .

The US military Cyber Command, which is responsible for military cyber-warfare and defense, is also on the base.

The complex hosts more than 11,000 military personnel and 29,000 civilian employees.
