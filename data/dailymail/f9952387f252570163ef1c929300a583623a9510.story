Halo Foods has been criticised by the advertising watchdog for suggesting honey is good for children

The Honey Monster has been slapped down by advertising watchdogs for suggesting honey is good for children.

The cereal that the character promotes, Sugar Puffs, has been banned from claiming it contains 'honey goodness' – as honey is just as bad for the body as sugar.

The Advertising Standards Authority ruled that the boast amounts to a bogus health claim.

Sales of honey are soaring, apparently because of the belief that as a natural product it is better for you. But health experts point out that once honey is consumed it behaves the same way in the body as sugar.

The advert on the cereal's website carried the claims: 'Yummy Honey Goodness For A Monsterfied Breakfast... 20% More Honey'.

This idea that the cereal – which contains 8.6 grams of sugar per 30g serving – was full of goodness was backed up by claims that it was low in fat and salt and a good source of fibre, vitamins and iron.

The ruling came after a complaint by the Children's Food Campaign, which said there was no specific authorised health claim to back up the honey goodness line.

Halo Foods, which owns the Honey Monster brand, said it had increased the amount of honey in the cereal while reducing the amount of sugar as part of a re-launch.

It said the website and the cereal's packaging provided detailed information about the ingredients and the company was 'transparent' about the sugar content of the product.

Halo Foods said it did not intend to make any specific health claims in association with honey and had therefore amended its website to remove any reference to the word goodness.

The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) concluded that the ad breached regulations because it was not accompanied by a specific authorised health claim and ruled that it must not appear again in its current form.

CFC co-ordinator Malcolm Clark said: 'We're pleased that the ASA has stopped the Honey Monster from trying to pull his yellow fur over consumers' eyes and pretend the cereal is healthier than its sugary reality.

'It still contains 8.6g of sugar per bowl - a monsterfied breakfast indeed from a dental health perspective.'

He said: 'The Children's Food Campaign should not have to step in so often to hold companies to account and ensure that even the most basic rules are being upheld.

'Overall, the ASA has yet to show that it is willing to provide proper protection to children from misleading junk food advertising.

'With just over four months until the General Election, we also remain unconvinced that any of the political parties are going to be offering the bold policies needed to effectively tackle junk food marketing to children or the wider obesogenic environment. 

'That is the political challenge ahead.'

Halo Foods insists the website was simply trying to convey that they had increased the amount of honey and reduced the use of sugar.

However, it has since removed use of the word 'goodness'.
