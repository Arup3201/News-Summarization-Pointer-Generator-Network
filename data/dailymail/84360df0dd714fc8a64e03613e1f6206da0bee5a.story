Harry Redknapp saw his QPR side roundly beaten on his return to Tottenham but insists he will stick with his new formation.

The 67-year-old was at White Hart Lane for the first time since being sacked in 2012 but his Rangers team were outclassed as Tottenham cantered to a 4-0 victory.

Nacer Chadli scored twice, with Eric Dier scoring his second goal in as many weeks and Emmanuel Adebayor adding a fourth after the break.

Mauricio Pochettino saw his attacking players shine, especially in the first half up against the back three on which Redknapp has pinned his survival hopes.

Rio Ferdinand, Steven Caulker and Richard Dunne were given the runaround before Redknapp reacted by changing to a back four for the second half.

Despite an improved performance, with only one goal shipped, Redknapp is not ready to give up on his 3-5-2 formations.

'I don't know if that (the system) is a problem,' he said.

'We played okay last week playing that well, it is about energy really. We were slower on the ball and were off the pace a bit - in certain areas we weren't sharp enough. We have to work harder both with and without the ball.

'I don't think it is systems. That system allows me to get two strikers into the team which I was trying to do.

'(Loic) Remy doesn't play up on his own, it is difficult. Charlie Austin doesn't play up on his own. You look to play 4-4-2 and you get slaughtered in midfield, it is not easy.'

The size of the victory saw Pochettino's side move to the top of the Barclays Premier League table, but the former Southampton boss was quick to dispel any early season talk of a title tilt.

'It is nothing,' he replied when asked about Tottenham sitting top of the table.

'It is two games. The most important thing is to try and develop our style and philosophy, (against QPR) we showed our basis.

'For me, it is important that the team show they are a team. We played like a team all together and we can achieve something.

'It is important to keep the reality and stay calm. If you lose two games you are in danger but we need to keep calm, it is only the beginning of the season.'

Pochettino remains more interested on getting his style in place rather than worrying about where Spurs sit in the standings.

'I'm in charge for my first season at Tottenham and at the moment we want to put in place our philosophy and play in the way that Tottenham have played in their history,' he added.

'We are very pleased. In front of our supporters and our first game of the season here it was a good game for us. I think we played well. We have players that can play in this way and we have belief.'
