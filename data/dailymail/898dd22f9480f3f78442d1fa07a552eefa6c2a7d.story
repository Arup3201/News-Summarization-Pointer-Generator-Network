Tragedy: Canadian mother-of-six Laura Lloyd died last Wednesday after her husband backed a trailer into her while leaving the house for work 

Six children are now without their mother, after the 34-year-old woman was run over by her husband as he backed his truck out of the driveway for work. 

Laura Lloyd of Alberta Beach, Canada was killed Wednesday morning in the freak accident. 

The elementary school secretary leaves behind six children including 11-month-old twins Isabella and Gabriella, 8-year-old Kira, 11-year-old Tianna, 12-year-old Riley and 14-year-old Chance. 

Lloyd's husband  was backing his GMC Sierra truck out of their yard Wednesday morning, when the trailer he was pulling struck and rolled over his wife, who died on the scene. 

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police say a mechanical inspection will be conducted on the vehicle. 

'It's very tragic,' RCMP Const. Kathleen Fossen told the Edmonton Journal. 

Lloyd was on maternity leave from her job as a secretary at Onoway Elementary School when the fatal accident occurred. 

She had worked there for the past three years and three of her children attended school there.

The school's principal Lynn Shabada remembered Lloyd as a 'wonderful' woman, loving mother and hard worker.

Lost a mother: The 34-year-old mother leaves behind 14-year-old son Chance, 12-year-old son Riley, 11-year-old daughter Tianna, 8-year-old daughter Kira and 11-month-old twin girls Isabella and Gabriella. Also pictured above is Lloyd's 5-year-old niece Londyn 

'Family was very important to her. It was the most important,' Shabada told CBC. 'She was committed to her job and really open and welcoming with the public and the children she worked with.'  

Lloyd had also been involved in the Onoway Minor Hockey Association for the past eight years, and the organization posted a statement on their website to mark her passing. 

'As an enthusiastic hockey mom, she was always so proud of her boys and their teams. Laura will be sadly missed by all who knew her,' the statement reads. 

Family and friends have started a GoFundMe page in the wake of Lloyd's passing, the raise money for her funeral. The remainder of the funds will go towards her children. The fund had raised more than $20,000 by Tuesday.
