British boxer Anthony Crolla has been taken to hospital with a serious head injury and a broken ankle after an altercation with two intruders on Tuesday night.

The Manchester lightweight was hit over the head with a concrete slab after he heard the burglars next door to his house in Chadderton.

Crolla, 28, was taken to Royal Oldham Hospital where he is stable and awaiting a scan.

FRANKIE GAVIN: Gutted for Anthony Crolla/ Had world title fight in six weeks which more than likely won't happen.

BARRY McGUIGAN: Genuinely sorry to hear of @ant_crolla injuries, one of boxing nice guys. Hope he makes a speedy recovery. 

AMIR KHAN: Really sorry to hear the news about @ant_crolla hope you get well soon mate 

TONY BELLEW: My heart goes out to him! The nicest kid in boxing full stop! 

His world title challenge against Richar Abril, scheduled for January 23 at the Manchester Arena, has been postponed.

Crolla's promoter Eddie Hearn told Sportsmail: 'We're devastated for Anthony and his family, you couldn't meet a nicer guy in boxing.

'It was a dream to get him his world title shot. I've alerted Abril's team and hopefully we can rearrange it but we don't know the extent of Anthony's injuries.

'His health is our first concern.'

Crolla was deep in training for his fight with Cuban Abril who holds the WBA title. 

And his trainer Joe Gallagher told the Manchester Evening News: 'He could have been killed.

'I've just spoken to him on the phone and he's heart-broken. He's all plastered-up and waiting for a CT scan. His title dream is gone. Whether he will ever get another shot at it in the future, I don't know. His dreams are in tatters.' 

Crolla lands a punch on John Murray on his way to victory over his close friend in Manchester this year

Crolla has rebuilt his career since losing to Derry Mathews in a British title fight two years ago.

A draw in the rematch a year later was followed by an impressive win over Gavin Rees and stoppages of Stephen Foster and John Murray. 

Crolla had said about the scheduled fight with Abril: 'To have the world title shot in Manchester is a huge factor.

'Without wanting to sound cheesy, it doesn't get any bigger than that. I am a Manchester lad so to be fighting in Manchester for a world title, I couldn't ask for anything more and the only way it could get better than that is to go out there and win it.'

Crolla is the third boxer to suffer serious injuries this year. World welterweight champion Kell Brook only recently returned to training after he was stabbed in the leg in Tenerife while former European champion Jamie Moore was shot in both legs in Marbella in August.

Crolla was due to fight Richar Abril for the WBA ligthweight title next month but that has been shelved
