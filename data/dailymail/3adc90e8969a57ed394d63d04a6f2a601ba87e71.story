Every time Britain manages to deport a foreign prisoner another one takes their place in jail - at an annual cost to the public of more than £300million.

The Government’s spending watchdog found that, despite repeated promises by ministers to fix the mess, human rights laws and other problems were still leading to huge delays in booting out overseas offenders.

In almost four in every ten cases studied by the National Audit Office, there was no prospect of imminent removal.

The result is that Britain’s jails are clogged with 11,000 foreign criminals.

And as soon as the Home Office does manage to kick somebody out, there is another immigrant convicted of a crime and sent to jail to take their place.

The annual bill for housing them in the packed prison estate is £308million.

Overall, the total number of all foreign criminals removed by the Home Office – which includes ex-inmates or people given a community sentence – has fallen by 14 per cent over the past four years.

In the final three months of 2009, 5,528 were removed, compared to 4,730 between April and June of this year.

The NAO blamed ‘complex human rights issues’ for the failure to remove foreign prisoners.

Other factors included criminals hiding their true identities, EU free movement diktats and delays in getting travel documents.

The report states: ‘Removals and new convictions are currently roughly equal to one another, meaning that the overall number of foreign national prisoners remains stable.

‘But removing more prisoners, or removing them earlier in their sentences, would significantly reduce costs. The cost of keeping 1,000 prisoners in prison is £28 million a year.’

Officials found that, in some cases, the Home Office was guilty of wasting time and public money.

In one example, poor record keeping meant efforts were made to deport someone who had not been sentenced for a criminal offence and had earlier been granted asylum.

Officials also pursue cases on the basis of when an offenders sentence is due to be concluded – rather than targeting those most likely to be removed.

The NAO found that officials had a realistic chance of deporting a criminal within three months of their release date in only two per cent of cases.

The report said the Home Office should prioritise cases better.

Britain’s jails contain inmates from around 150 countries - three out of every four nations in the world.

Cameron hailed a transfer agreement with EU countries designed to send more home.

Ministers have been trying for years to find new ways of booting out foreign criminals. Under Labour, they included offering bribes of up to £1,500 each to any inmate who leaves voluntarily.

In 2010, David Cameron promised to ‘intervene personally’ to fix the shambles.

The Prime Minister hailed a transfer agreement with EU countries designed to send inmates home to serve their sentence.

But, during the first year of operation, not a single inmate was removed. The two countries with the most inmates in Britain – Poland and Ireland – were given opt-outs by the previous Labour government.

Earlier this year, Mr Cameron announced UK taxpayers are to fund a major prison building programme in poor countries such as Nigeria and Jamaica

Foreign criminals have been blamed for the overcrowding problems in our jails. Last Friday, the prison population was 85,429, with capacity at 85,938, leaving just 509 spare places.

Labour justice spokesman Sadiq Khan said: ‘Latest Ministry of Justice figures show there are just 509 prison spaces left in England and Wales, with the system operating at over 99% of capacity.

‘Things are so bad that police stations and court cells might have to be used. Public confidence in our justice system will be massively damaged if there’s not enough space in prisons to lock up criminals.’
