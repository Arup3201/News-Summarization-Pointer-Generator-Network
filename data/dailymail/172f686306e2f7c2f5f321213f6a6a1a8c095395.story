Two men have been arrested for separate sex attacks on British women in a Turkish seaside resort.

One of the women was held at knife-point and a second was raped by a taxi driver in Marmaris, it has today been reported. 

One victim, a 28 year old woman, claims to have woken in the early hours to a man standing at the end of her bed and holding a blade. They are the latest in a string of attacks on British tourists in the popular resort.

Two men have been arrested for separate sex attacks on British women in Turkish seaside resort of Marmaris. Blood stained Harun K, 30, is arrested by Turkish police following an alleged attempted rape of a British woman in Marmaris last week

One of the women was held at knife-point and a second was raped by a taxi driver in Marmaris, it has today been reported

Local police say he was planning to burgle the woman's apartment but after seeing her half naked in bed he instead tried to rape her, the Sunday Mirror reports.

The woman, who lives and works in Turkey, fought him off, biting his fingers and drawing blood. She managed to flee to the bathroom and locked herself inside.

Hearing her screams, her neighbours came to her aid and caught her attacked as he fled. 

A man named Harun K has been arrested in connection with the attack. He has appeared in a special court and has been remanded in custody.

The resort hit headlines once again thanks to the high-profile case of Faye Jones, a 16-year-old schoolgirl from Cramlington, Northumberland, who ran away with 22-year-old Turkish waiter Murat Can Ertani

In the second attack a 21-year-old woman claims she raped by a taxi driver because she did not have the money to pay the fare after she took a cab back to her hotel after a night out.

She said when the driver realised she could not pay, he drove off with her still in the car. He took her to one location where she allowed him to kiss and fondle her because she 'feared for her safety.'

But then he drove her to a separate location where he raped her.

She later went to local police  and filed a rape charge.The taxi driver was arrested and insisted the sex was consensual. He has now been released on bail while police investigate.

The incidents are the latest in a string of attacks on British tourists in Marmaris - which is fast earning a reputation as a mecca for drunken holiday makers.

Earlier this month a holiday maker was hit over the head with a bottle in an attack in the street.

The 27-year-old Londoner, who had been on a night out with his girlfriend, had been hit over the head with a bottle during a drunken brawl. It’s believed to have begun when he knocked over a local man’s drink.

It came just a week after Dwayne Ward, 17, was attacked with a pen-knife and slashed with a razor after a night out in the popular tourist resort.

He was then stripped naked and left for dead.

The teenager was allegedly ambushed. His attackers are said to have robbed, stripped, stabbed and slashed him and dumped his body in a local garden.

Those accused are now on remand facing charges including robbery, wounding with intent and attempted murder.

And last week the resort hit headlines once again thanks to the high-profile case of Faye Jones, a 16-year-old schoolgirl from Cramlington, Northumberland, who ran away with 22-year-old Turkish waiter Murat Can Ertani.

No charges were made against the waiter, after Faye confessed she had gone of her own free will having convinced him she was 19

It comes weeks after Dwayne Ward, 17, was attacked with a pen-knife and slashed with a razor after a night out in the popular tourist resort

Jones had been on the final day of a holiday with her mother, Rhonda, who reported her missing.

After a massive manhunt, she was eventually found four days later, roughly 40 miles away.

No charges were made against the waiter, after Faye confessed she had gone of her own free will having convinced him she was 19.

Local mayor Ali Acar told the Sunday Mirror that the recent headlines were damaging for the town.

He said: 'What Marmaris has experienced in the past few weeks is so sad and we can’t accept it.

'We are identifying the problems and who created them. People must feel safe when they come on holiday and we do everything we can to protect them.
