A serial killer was put to death Thursday in Texas after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected his lawyers' demand that the state release information about where it gets its lethal injection drug.

Tommy Lynn Sells, 49, was the first inmate to be injected with a dose of newly replenished pentobarbital that Texas prison officials obtained to replace an expired supply of the powerful sedative.

Sells declined to give a statement. As the drug began flowing into his arms inside the death chamber in Huntsville, Sells took a few breaths, his eyes closed and he began to snore. After less than a minute, he stopped moving. He was pronounced dead at 6:27 p.m. CDT - 13 minutes after being given the pentobarbital.

Convicted killer: Tommy Lynn Sells was put to death Thursday with the lethal drug pentobarbital

Terry Harris, whose 13-year-old daughter, Kaylene Harris, was fatally stabbed by Sells in 1999 in South Texas, watched as Sells was executed, saying the injection was 'way more gentle than what he gave out.'

'What a great day!' the father said as witnesses turned to leave the death house.

Sells' lawyers had made a plea to the Supreme Court earlier in the day after a federal appeals court on Wednesday allowed the execution to remain on schedule. A lower court had stopped the execution Wednesday, ordering the Texas Department of Criminal Justice to reveal more information about its drug supplier, but the ruling was quickly tossed on appeal.

Sells, who claims to have committed as many as 70 killings across the U.S., also lost an appeal before the high court that contended his case should be reviewed because he had poor legal help during his murder trial.

In their drug argument, Sells' 
attorneys argued they needed to know the name of the pharmacy now 
providing the state with pentobarbital used during executions in order 
to verify the drug's quality and protect Sells from unconstitutional 
pain and suffering.

But the 
Supreme Court, like the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, sided with 
Texas prison officials, who argued that information about the drug 
supplier must be kept secret to protect the pharmacy from threats of 
violence. The high court justices did not elaborate on why they made the
 decision, which came about an hour before Sells' scheduled execution.

State
 attorneys argued the new pentobarbital stock falls within the 
acceptable ranges of potency. Sells' attorneys said they had no way of 
confirming that.

The Supreme
 Court last month rejected similar arguments from a Missouri inmate's 
attorneys who challenged the secrecy surrounding where that state 
obtained its execution drugs, and the condemned prisoner was put to 
death.

Questions about the 
source of execution drugs have arisen in several states in recent months
 as numerous drugmakers - particularly in Europe, where opposition to 
capital punishment is strongest - have refused to sell their products if
 they will be used in executions.

That's
 led several state prison systems to compounding pharmacies, which are 
not as heavily regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as 
more conventional pharmacies.

A
 batch of pentobarbital that Texas purchased from a compounding pharmacy
 in suburban Houston expired at the end of March. The pharmacy refused 
to sell the state any more drugs, citing threats it received after its 
name was made public.

Texas found a new, undisclosed supplier.

The
 court case challenging the state's stance also included 44-year-old 
Ramiro Hernandez-Llanas, who is scheduled for execution next week. But 
the 5th Circuit ruling affected only Sells.

Sells' execution was the fifth lethal injection this year in Texas, the nation's busiest state for the death penalty.

A
 jury convicted him of capital murder in 2000 for the stabbing death of 
Kaylene Harris and slashing of her 10-year-old friend, Krystal Surles, 
who survived and helped police find Sells. The girls were attacked on 
New Year's Eve 1999 as they slept in Harris' home in Del Rio, about 150 
miles west of San Antonio.
