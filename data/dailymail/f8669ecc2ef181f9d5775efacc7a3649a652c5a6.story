Four of celebrity chef Marco Pierre White’s pubs have gone into administration as accounts reveal he is owed more than £1 million.

Disgruntled staff have spoken out claiming suppliers have been let down and bills are unpaid, and administrators have confirmed they have been appointed as a result of the ‘businesses experiencing short term cash flow problems’.

The Wayford Bridge Inn and the Acle Bridge Inn on the Norfolk Broads and the Chequers Inn and The Lifeboat Inn in Thornham, Norfolk are set to be sold off.

Chequers Inn: The chef's pub in Thornham will be sold off after the business experienced 'short-term cash flow problems'

Restructuring specialists Zolfo Cooper confirmed today that the four pubs went into administration on Monday.

The pubs are part of Horatio Inns Limited, which owns just the four venues, and Mr White is listed as one of the directors of on Companies House website.

The most recent set of accounts on Companies House reveals the chef is owed more than £1 million, although it is not known whether this outstanding balance has since been settled.

A Zolfo Cooper spokeswoman said: ‘The administrators were appointed as a result of the businesses experiencing short term cash flow problems arising from the recent challenging economic environment.’

She said trade will continue at the restaurants, adding: ‘The venues are very popular and have a healthy number of existing bookings which the administrators fully intend to honour.’

Nick Cropper, a partner in restructuring services at Zolfo Cooper, said: ‘We believe the businesses are attractive to a range of potential buyers and we welcome expressions of interest from third parties to acquire any or all of the sites.

‘We would also like to thank the staff for their continued support and professionalism during this process.’ 

An employee at another of his venues, the Carnarvon Arms in Highclere, Berkshire, which is the former coach house to neighbouring Highclere Castle, better known as TV’s Downton Abbey, said it was up for sale. 

Trade continues: The Acle Bridge Inn on the Norfolk Broads will remain open and administrators intend to honour existing bookings

A member of staff at the Lifeboat Inn in Thornham said: 'The bills have not been paid for ages, there are a lot of local suppliers who have been let down'

The worker at Carnarvon Arms said staff have known the restaurant has been up for sale since October, but they were only told officially in January.

Since then, they say furniture and fittings, including sofas and curtains, have been taken from the venue.

Zolfo Cooper is not dealing with with the Carnarvon Arms.

A member of staff at the Lifeboat Inn, who asked not be named, said: ‘We had no warning, the administrators just walked in on Monday.

‘Everything has been transferred over to the administrators, they are dealing with everything now.

‘Marco had quite a big role in the business but I think he knew something was wrong.

‘The bills have not been paid for ages, there are a lot of local suppliers who have been let down.

‘We have all been told that we are safe and that the administrators are dealing with everything and that they will keep the business running.’

Celebrity chef: One of Mr White's gastro-pubs was sold last year amid reports it was boycotted by locals

The pubs are part of Pierre White’s Wheeler’s of St James’s group.

Workers at the Frogmill in Cheltenham, Gloustershire and the Rudloe Arms in Wiltshire - part of the group - said as far as they were aware they are not closing.

It has not been possible to contact The Horse & Groom near Malmesbury in Wiltshire and the Black Boy Inn at Milton near Banbury, Oxfordshire.

Craig Clark, 20, worked as a restaurant supervisor during the majority of Mr White’s tenure at The Angel pub in Lavenham, Suffolk.

It was bought from the Hell’s Kitchen chef in November last year.

He said: ‘This isn’t part of the Marco Pierre White group anymore.

‘I have also been told that the Carnarvon Arms is going up for sale, the Wayford Bridge Inn is being stripped and The Lifeboat is heading that way too.' 

Last year, Mr White sold one of his gastro-pubs amid reports it was boycotted by locals and subject to a mass staff walkout.

The celebrity chef bought the Pear Tree Inn in Whitley, Wiltshire in 2011, but quickly came under fire from locals for charging high prices and apparently converting it into a posh London-style eatery.

Downton: An employee at Mr White's Carnarvon Arms in Highclere, Berkshire, which is the former coach house to neighbouring Highclere Castle, better known as TV’s Downton Abbey, said it was also up for sale

In August, it was also claimed that just a single manager was left at the gastro-pub after a ‘mass walkout’ by ‘frustrated’ staff who were fed up with White’s allegedly ‘bossy’ management style.

Mr White owns a string of steakhouse and Italian restaurants and pubs, and was dubbed the first ‘celebrity chef’.

He has trained top chefs including Gordon Ramsay and was the youngest person to be awarded three Michelin stars.

In November, it was announced Mr White’s colourful journey from a council estate in Leeds is to be made into a Hollywood film by the British film director and producer Sir Ridley Scott.

The chef sold the rights to his bestselling autobiography, The Devil In The Kitchen, to Sir Scott, whose films include Gladiator, Black Hawk Down, Blade Runner and Thelma And Louise.

MailOnline has contacted Mr White’s representatives for comment.
