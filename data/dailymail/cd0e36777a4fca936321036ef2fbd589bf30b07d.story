Wolfsburg delegates are in London hoping to thrash out a deal for Chelsea midfielder Andre Schurrle.

The Germany international, who wants to leave Stamford Bridge, was left out of Chelsea’s FA Cup squad which lost to Bradford on Saturday.

And Wolfsburg representatives met with Schurrle’s father Joachim on Monday in the hope of finalising a deal.

Wolfsburg have  offered £23million for the Germany international, but Chelsea are holding out for £30m

Wolfsburg have already offered £23million for Schurrle, as exclusively revealed by Sportsmail earlier this month. But the Blues are holding out for £30m for the World Cup winner.

Chelsea are keen to press through their deal as they continue in their bid for Fiorentina forward Juan Cuadrado in the transfer window.

Chelsea have offered Mohamed Salah to the Italian club in the hope of signing the striker.
