It is impossible to keep people 100 per cent safe from terror attacks in an 'open and free society', David Cameron warned today as police increased protection for officers. 

Scotland Yard's Mark Rowley announced he is also in talks with Jewish leaders offering their community great protection including more patrols in key areas.

It comes after officers were 'deliberately targeted' by gunmen in Paris and the attack on a kosher supermarket in the French capital .

Fanatical gunman Amedy Coulibaly last week murdered four shoppers before being killed by armed police in a siege in the quiet residential area of Vincennes in Paris.

Earlier Coulibaly had shot dead a policewoman, apparently inspired by the killing spree of Said and Cherif Kouachi who stormed the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. The brothers killed 12 people, including two police officers.

In response, British security services have stepped up surveillance and David Cameron ordered new training exercises to reflect a Paris-style attack which lasted for several days and spread over a large area. 

However, the deliberate targeting of police in the Paris attack has also raised fears about the dangers faced by frontline staff in Britain. 

It raises the prospect of more armed police on the streets and greater use of bullet proof vests and armour. 

David Cameron, speaking in Washington where he was meeting Barack Obama at the White House, said: 'It's very important to learn the lessons from anything happening elsewhere in Europe. Could that happen here? What steps should be taken? 

'So the police have announced today that they'll be stepping up patrols particularly to protect the Jewish community.

'The government has a very strong relationship with the Jewish community, it talks to them regularly about these issues. 

'We have to be incredibly vigilant and look at all of these risks, particularly risks to police officers themselves and take every action that we can.;

He said he would not give a 'running commentary' on specific threats but security was being stepped up. 

Posters advertising a Holocaust memorial event have been daubed with graffiti including the words 'liars' and 'killers', it emerged.

The Metropolitan Police said the incidents, which took place in Stratford, east London, were being listed as a 'hate crime', and said officers in Newham were investigating.

Newham Council received pictures of the offences - involving three posters publicising the council's Holocaust memorial day event - through social media.

The next day Clarissa Jean-Philippe (right) was shot dead by Amedy Coulibaly, who went on to kill four people in a siege in a Jewish supermarket

In the hours after the attack on Charlie Hebdo's offices, extra armed police were deployed across London, including in Westminster and at St Pancras train station.

Armed police and sniffer dogs were also seen patrolling on London Bridge today, with the threat level still set at severe. 

The Association of Chief Police Officers has been reviewing its security measures following the devastating attacks in Paris last week.

Mr Rowley, a Met assistant commissioner, said in a statement: 'The global picture of terrorist activity does give us heightened concern about the risk to the Jewish community in the UK. 

'We are seeing continuing anti-Semitic rhetoric from extremists and attacks on this community in France and elsewhere.

'In addition to our existing security measures, we are in dialogue with Jewish Community leaders about further actions that we will be taking, including more patrols in key areas.

'We remain alert to the vulnerabilities of other communities. Where we do have particular concerns, we make these known to those involved.'

The increased security in Britain comes after the attack on a kosher supermarket in Paris last week, after gunman Amedy Coulibaly took more than a dozen peopple hostage

He stressed that the police are aware of people trying to exploit the current tensions to create 'fear' in Muslim communities.

He added: 'We are also considering what further measures we might put in place to enhance the security of police officers, given some of the deliberate targeting of the police we have seen in a number of countries across Europe and the world.

'Chief constables across the country are reviewing how to strengthen the protection of their officers from such attacks. 

'Our men and women on the frontline are used to confronting risk and danger and are well-trained in how to protect the public and themselves.'
