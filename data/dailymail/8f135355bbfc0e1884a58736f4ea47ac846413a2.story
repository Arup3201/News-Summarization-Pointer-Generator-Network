Manchester United made a late swoop to bring in Radamel Falcao on loan from Monaco just before the transfer window slammed shut.

The former Atletico Madrid striker will give Louis van Gaal another impressive attacking option, but can he find a way to play him alongside star men Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie?

We asked out three wise men - Jamie Carragher, Martin Keown and Jamie Redknapp - where Falcao will fit in this season.

JAMIE REDKNAPP: He's one of the best No 9s I've ever seen. His movement and ability to hold up the ball is phenomenal. Anyone who can keep Diego Costa out of the Atletico Madrid team must be special. 

As long as he's fit after his cruciate-ligament injury, he will rip this league apart. He's athletic, has spring and can finish with subtlety or smash the ball into the top corner. 

Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney might not be happy — Falcao's United's No 1 now. If Van Gaal plays 3-5-2, there will be so many unhappy players: where do Mata and Januzaj fit in? One thing is for sure — they have to get into the top four now they've spent all that money.

Options: Manchester United manager Van Gaal could play Wayne Rooney wide or behind his front two

Versatile: Rooney, pictured in action against Burnley, looks likely to move from his role as a central striker

JAMIE CARRAGHER: We used to love small strikers like Robbie Fowler or Michael Owen, but now it is all about the men who can lead the line on their own. Falcao is one of them, a forward with real presence who will score goals. Ever since his superb performance for Atletico Madrid against Chelsea in the Super Cup two seasons ago, I thought he would move to one of Europe's giants. It was a waste playing in the French league because a player of that quality needs to be somewhere better.

I can see Wayne Rooney dropping back and taking Juan Mata's place in behind Falcao and Robin van Persie. But it will be tough for United to rotate players and give everyone game time as they have no European games or even the Capital One Cup. Not that Louis van Gaal will be afraid to drop people.

Rotation: Robin van Persie could find himself out wide in a 4-2-3-1 or on the bench in Van Gaal goes 3-5-2

MARTIN KEOWN: He attacks things in the box and loves getting across the face of defenders. He's brave too. Maybe we'll now see United put more crosses into the box for their out-and-out No 9. Van Persie takes the corners and free-kicks, Falcao attacks them. 

He made his league debut at 13 and has been banging in goals ever since - he's a natural born finisher. Mata will miss out. You could play Falcao up top and a three behind of Di Maria, Van Persie and Rooney with Blind and Herrera sitting deep when everyone is fit.
