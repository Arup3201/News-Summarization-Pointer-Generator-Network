Mario Swain, 33, was convicted of murdering Lola Nixon, 44, during a break-in at her Texas home in 2002

A man described as a 'serial killer-in-training' is set to die tonight in Texas after he bludgeoned a woman to death during a burglary at her home almost a decade ago.

Mario Swain, 33, was convicted of murdering Lola Nixon, 44, during a break-in at her home in 2002.

When Nixon returned home in Longview, Texas, he bludgeoned her with a tire tool, stabbed her and likely strangled her, according to an account by the attorney general's office.

Swain put Nixon in the trunk of her car, drove her to a field and left her barely conscious.

He later led investigators to an abandoned car with Nixon's body inside.

Investigators connected Swain to a truck parked on Nixon's street the night she went missing. Swain first accused two other men of the crime, but both had alibis.

Swain's execution by lethal injection is scheduled to take place after 7pm (EST) at the state prison in Huntsville.

Thirty-six inmates have been executed this year in the United States, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.

The U.S. Supreme Court declined on October 15 to review Swain's case.

Swain's attorney, James Volberding, said no late attempts were made in the courts to block the execution, which will be the 13th this year in the nation's busiest capital punishment state.

Swain declined media interview requests as his execution date neared.

Ms Nixon was supposed to go to 
dinner with friends that Friday night after Christmas but didn't show 
up. When she couldn't be reached the next day, friends called police who
found the back door of her home jimmied and blood throughout the place.

A neighbor who saw an unfamiliar 
truck parked on the street the previous night reported that to police 
and the truck was tracked to Swain.

He initially blamed friends for the burglary, then led police to Nixon's body. Authorities determined she'd been beaten with a tire iron, stabbed and strangled.

The tire iron was recovered from a trash container where Swain said he had thrown it. Evidence showed he used Nixon's credit cards and gave a piece of her stolen jewelry to a friend. Nixon's blood was found on Swain's clothing in the truck, along with her car keys and garage door opener.

According to evidence and testimony at trial, Swain would gather information about women he wanted to rob and then attack them, forcing them to inhale the anesthetic halothane and hitting them over the head with a wrench or shooting them with a stun gun.

Lance Larison, a prosecutor at Swain's trial, called Swain 'a serial killer in training'.

'A girlfriend told us he kept a list in notebooks of names and license plates of girls he would follow,' Larison said. 'I think he was working up to something.'

It's not clear if Swain knew Nixon. She managed a Longview telephone call center where Swain once worked.

One of Swain's trial lawyers, Rick Hagan, said the evidence and vivid testimony from those who said Swain robbed them hindered the defense's efforts to convince jurors to spare Swain of the death penalty.

Larson said blood evidence in the case was 'consistent with a struggle' inside Nixon's home, where she lived alone.

Deborah Hancock, a friend of Ms Nixon, said: 'I can't believe it's been 10 years. She was very outgoing and very direct, fun, lively. She was just one of a kind.'

Swain's execution is to be followed by two more next week in Texas.
