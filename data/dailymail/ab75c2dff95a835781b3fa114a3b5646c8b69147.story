Most daughters idolise their mothers, so when Jessica Smith's four-year-old told her she wanted a 'big tummy' like hers she knew she had to do something drastic about her 18-stone frame. 

In the days that followed, she went on a strict liquid diet and documented her weight loss by taking daily photos of herself in the same outfit in front of her bedroom mirror.

Every day, she'd monitor her progress by flicking through the photos on her smart phone and seeing the visible changes to her waistline.

Incredibly, in the first week, she 
lost 10 pounds and says the difference in her physical appearance in the
 'day one' picture to the 'day seven' photo was huge.

Naturally,
 the fantastic results spurred Jessica to continue with her diet, and 
six months later the mother-of-three had shed an incredible six stone - 
taking her from a size 26 to a svelte 12.

Speaking to The Sun she said: 'Taking pictures of myself really helped me track my weight loss. Sometimes it's hard to see the difference when you're looking in the mirror every day and it can be disheartening for slimmers if they can't tell their hard work is paying off. 

'Like most people on diets, at times you can get depressed and there's a temptation to pig out if you're not seeing the effects of your hard work quick enough. But my timeline of pics on my phone helped me to stay focussed and on the straight and narrow.

'I was devastated when my beautiful daughter told me she wanted to be fat like me and I didn't want her grow up thinking obesity was normal.

'Overweight people need to know the effect their lifestyle is having on their children. It was a real eye-opener for me.'

Growing up, Jessica says she was 
always curvy and bigger than her peers. But it wasn't until the birth of
 her third child, Cerys, now 17 months, that she started to pile on the 
pounds.

'Throughout my 
early 20s my weight fluctuated between a size 14-16,' said Jessica, a 
full time mum who lives with her husband Ryan, 24, a photographer, and 
their three children Pheobe, five, Ethan, four and Cerys, 17 months, in 
Powys, Wales.

'But leading up to my wedding in July 2011 I was really strict on myself and determined to fit into a size 12-14 dress.

'The
 problem was that after the wedding I resumed my bad eating habits and 
regained all the weight I'd lost. But it wasn't until Cerys arrived in 
August 2012 that I really piled on the pounds.'

Shockingly, around this time Jessica admits she was packing away 4,000 calories a day - double the recommended amount for women.

She
 says: 'Ryan's 6ft and eats like a horse. Stupidly, I thought I could 
graze all day like him and I'd be fine, but at 5ft 7ins I couldn't get 
away with it.

'On a daily 
basis I was gorging on McDonald's three times a week, greasy takeaway 
and sugary snacks and cakes. What's more, I was eating late at night, 
mainly out of boredom, in front of the TV. It wasn't healthy and I felt 
miserable most of the time. Not only was I harming myself - but giving 
my kids a bad role model because they thought the way I looked was 
normal.

'Simple things like 
picking the kids up required a major effort because my gigantic belly 
would get in the way. I was so unhealthy that I'd huff and puff over the
 smallest task.'

But the wake-up call Jessica desperately needed came in April 2013.

'One
 afternoon Phoebe came home in floods of tears,' continues Jessica, 'I 
sat her down and asked her what was wrong. She told me a mum at the 
school gates had commented on how skinny she was.

'Confused,
 I asked her why that had upset her and she replied, 'because I want a 
big tummy like you'. I burst into tears and hugged her. I was riddled 
with guilt and in that moment I realised I had to do something drastic 
about my weight once and for all.

'I
 was her idol and I'd let her down. By being overweight I'd unwittingly 
presented this distorted view of the world and made her think being fat 
was normal.'

That night Jessica told Ryan she was going on a strict diet and he said he'd support her totally.

She
 says: 'I started looking at diet plans and decided the Cambridge Diet 
Plan was the best one for me. I'd used it when I lost weight for my 
wedding and I knew I needed something really strict to kick-start my 
weight loss.

'On other 
diets, I'd cheat or make excuses - but you can't really cheat on this 
one because the 'meals' are set out and you have weekly weigh-ins with 
your consultant.'

The regime is strict - Jessica had to swap her fat, starchy meals for three liquid shakes a day at the expense of Â£40 a week.

At first she felt miserable and constantly tired, but she hated being 18 stone 12 more than any other feelings. 

'It
 was really tough,' she admits. 'I'm a foodie and I used to love sitting
 down with Ryan and the kids and tucking into a hearty meal. But taking 
daily photos of my weight loss spurred me on and stopped me from 
relapsing.

'I deliberately 
bought new leggings and a tight top so I could monitor the weight loss 
properly. I only wore the clothes when I was weighing myself in front of
 the mirror and taking a pic. I didn't want to stretch them as it might 
not give a true representation of what I'd lost.

'Soon,
 Phoebe wanted to know what drinks I was having as meal replacements. So
 I explained that mummy had eaten too many bad foods like sweets and 
chocolate and had become fat as a result.'

Incredibly,
 Jessica shed 10lbs in one week - taking her down to just under 18 
stone. On top of her diet plan, Jessica did 100 stomach sit-ups a day 
and pilates three times a week to strengthen her muscles.

'It was amazing,' she recalls, 
'the diet was hard core and sometimes I'd burst into tears when I put 
the kids' dinner on the table because I was so hungry and craving solid 
food. But then I would take my phone out of my pocket and have a quick 
flick through the pics to remind myself why I was doing this. It was 
just the incentive I needed to help me through the bad times.'

As
 the months rolled by, the weight continued to drop off. By October, six
 months into the diet plan, she weighed 12 stone and was a size 12.

She
 says: 'I couldn't believe it. I looked like a new woman! Friends who 
hadn't seen me for a while didn't recognise me when they saw me. They'd 
do a double-take and ask if it was me.

'And
 it wasn't just my diet I'd radically changed, it was my life-style too.
 Before, when I met up with friends I'd scoff cakes and guzzle hot 
chocolate laced with cream - now I'd order a herbal tea instead.

Last
 month, Jessica started introducing solids back into her diet. She now 
has a shake for breakfast, a chicken salad for lunch and a low carb 
dinner in the evening, such as steamed fish with vegetables.

'Although I'm happy with my weight loss I'm determined not to drift back into my bad old ways. I want to reach my target weight of 10 stone and be a size ten. I still take photos every day and I'm shocked when I look through the old ones and see how big I was. It's terrifying to think I was carrying so much weight around with me and putting my health at risk.

'I have so much more energy nowadays and l enjoy running around with the kids now. Ryan loves my new shape and is looking forward to treating me to a new wardrobe this Christmas.

Although I was devastated by my daughter's comment at the time, looking back it was the best thing that ever happened to me. It gave me the wake-up call I so desperately needed.'
