FIFA 
President Sepp Blatter has confessed on TV what the rest of the world 
already believed - that it was a mistake to award the World Cup to the 
boiling desert state of Qatar.

But the world’s governing body continue to insist the tournament will still take place in the gulf in 2022 – probably in winter.

Twitter blast: Gary Lineker (centre), who leads the BBC World Cup team', has criticised Sepp Blatter

Making his feelings known: Lineker posted several tweets on Blatter's comments on Friday morning

Blatter, who has previously backed the controversial decision to award the World Cup to Qatar despite summer temperatures of 120 degrees, performed his u-turn on Swiss TV channel RTS on Friday.

‘Of course, it was a mistake. You know, one makes a lot of mistakes in life,’ he said.

‘The technical report indicated clearly that it was too hot in summer, but despite that the executive committee decided, with quite a big majority, that the tournament would be in Qatar.’

He also admitted political factors had been a factor in choosing Qatar.

‘I have never said it was bought, but that it was due to political considerations,’ he added.

Owning up: FIFA president Sepp Blatter says it was a mistake to award Qatar the 2022 World Cup

England legend Gary Lineker was among 
those who hit out at Blatter for making the wrong call and sarcastically
 predicted the 78-year-old head of world football would now want to 
stand down.

Lineker said on Twitter: ‘You have one decision to make 
every 4 years! HELP!! Blatter "everyone makes mistakes." Pretty big one.
 He's the man in charge. I imagine his resignation letter is being 
composed as we tweet!!!

'Imagine the shock at FIFA HQ when, 2 years after the vote, someone spotted that Qatar's a tad warm in summer.

Shadow
 International Development secretary Jim Murphy added: 'Strange that 
Sepp Blatter saying #Qatar2022 is mistake when during bidding process he
 did a good impression of being their campaign manager'.

And the winner is: Blatter names Qatar as the winning hosts back in December 2010

Fifa acted quickly to squash speculation that Blatter’s interview could lead to them taking the tournament away from Qatar.

They
 put out a statement later in the day saying: ‘As explained in his 
answer to the journalist, the president reiterated that the decision to 
organize the World Cup in summer was an 'error' based on the technical 
assessment report of the bid, which had highlighted the extremely hot 
temperatures in summer in Qatar.

At no stage did he question Qatar as the host of the 2022 FIFA World Cup.’

Blatter
 himself said it was ‘probable, in fact it’s even more than probable’ 
the event will be played in winter when temperatures are cooler. Dates 
between November 15 and January 15 have been suggested.

Blatter’s admission is the latest controversy to hit Qatar since they were awarded the finals in 2010.   In a previous interview, Fifa’s head inspector Harold Mayne-Nicholls said it ‘was not the best option.’

And
 Blatter responded to Qatar’s tough laws on homosexuality by joking that
 gay people should “refrain from sexual actitities” during the 
competition.
