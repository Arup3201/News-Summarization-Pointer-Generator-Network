Forget the idea Neanderthals simply picked any old cave to sleep in for the night.

Researchers have discovered an elaborate 44,000-year-old Neanderthal house in Molodova, eastern Ukraine, made from mammoth bones, delicately decorated with carvings and pigments.

It had been thought Neanderthals, which died out around 30,000 years ago, were primitive nomads who lived in caves simply for shelter.

Caveman: Although we traditionally think the Neanderthal as less than homey, new research shows they did settle down in places, even building homes

The latest discovery is believed to be the earliest example of a domestic house built from bone and suggests our ancestors were more homey than previously thought.

Researchers from the Muséum National d'Histories Naturelle in Paris said it suggests the early human ancestors settled in areas where they built structures to live for extended periods of time.

Laëtitia Demay, an archaeologist who led the research, told The Telegraph: 'This mammoth bone structure could be described as the basement of a wooden cover or as a windscreen.

New research: Usually Neanderthals are associated with caves, like Kent's Caven (pictured) where a jaw bone was discovered

'The use of bones as building elements can be appreciated as anticipation of climatic variations. Under a cold climate in an open environment, the lack of wood led humans to use bones to build protections against the wind.'

The circular house was made up of 116 large bones including mammoth skulls, jaws, 14 tusks and leg bones.

Home is where the heart is: It seems like the Neanderthal Man, pictured here in the Neanderthal Museum in Mettmann by Duesseldorf, Northrhine-Westphalia, Germany, did like to settle down occasionally

And inside at least 25 hearths filled with ash were also found, suggesting it had been used for some time.

It is believed the Neanderthals hunted and killed the mammoths for meat before using their bones but also collected some of the bones from animals that had died of natural causes.

Simon Underdown, a senior lecturer in
 biological anthropology who researches Neanderthals at Oxford Brookes 
University, told The Telegraph 'It's another piece in the newly emerging
 Neanderthal jigsaw puzzle.

'Far from being the stupid cavemen of 
popular image it's becoming increasingly clear the Neanderthals were a 
highly sophisticated species of human.

All the research will be published in scientific journal Quaternary International.

It adds to the growing view that Neanderthals sophisticated humans who has their own culture and may have even used language to communicate.
