She may have moved across the Atlantic but Princess Eugenie hasn't forgotten her roots.

The daughter of Prince Andrew was pictured in New York today wearing a vibrant scarf in the style of the Union flag emblazoned with the slogan 'God Save The Queen'.

The monarch's granddaughter is being both patriotic and stylish with her choice of accessory as the silk scarf is an Alexander McQueen design which costs $425 (£263).

Her long, colourful scarf stood out against the rest of her all-black outfit while she opted for comfortable footwear by donning pumps as she strolled through the Big Apple with a friend. But she looked ever the professional thanks to a smart statement bag on her shoulder.

The 24-year-old moved to New York in September to work at online art auction house, Paddle8.

The company launched in 2011 describing themselves as an 'auction house for the 21st-century collector' and have been backed by Damien Hirst, Matthew Mellon and Jay Jopling.

While at work, the history of art graduate is simply known as Eugenie York and she's shunned the leafy, affluent Central Park area to live in the thriving Meatpacking District of Manhattan.

The princess was reported to be anxious about her move as she knew few people in the city. Her departure has also meant she has to have a long distance relationship with boyfriend, Jack Brooksbank, who works for the London nightclub Mahiki. 'We spend a lot of time on Skype,' he said recently, according to YOU magazine. 

The royal certainly didn't seem homesick as she was out today as she was pictured laughing and chatting with her female companion. 

But perhaps her scarf was a comforting reminder of her family back home.
