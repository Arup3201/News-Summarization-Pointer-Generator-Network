Arsenal midfielder Mesut Ozil seems to have retained soft spots for his former clubs Schalke and Real Madrid, and posed with his thumbs up while watching them play each other in the round of 16 Champions League tie on Wednesday night.

Ozil began his career at Schalke in 2006 and played for Madrid between 2010 and 2013, where he was a key member of then manager Jose Mourinho's side that won the Copa del Rey in 2011 and La Liga in 2012.   

He joined Arsenal in September 2013 for a club-record £42 million fee and has so far made 53 appearances for the north London outfit, scoring 11 times.

Since returning from a knee injury in January, Ozil has been in superb form, clocking up three goals and two assists in his last six appearances, with Arsenal winning five of those games.

Arsene Wenger's team currently sit fifth in the Premier League table with 45 points, just two behind third-placed Manchester United. 

The Gunners are targeting qualification for the Champions League for the 18th consecutive season.
