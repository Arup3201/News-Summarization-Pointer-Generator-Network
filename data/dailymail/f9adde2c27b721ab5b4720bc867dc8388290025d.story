Just for a moment, when he gained a thin edge to an attempted pull off Pakistan' s Sohail Khan in Auckland, it was possible to believe that Abraham Benjamin de Villiers was human after all.

All other evidence suggests the South African known as AB is some kind of super power, a man so talented in so many sports that cricket was blessed when he decided to make taking one-day batting to another, exalted level his destiny.

Nothing sums up England's out-dated methods at this otherwise expansive World Cup than to watch the extraordinary De Villiers going about his work.

Okay, perhaps it is unfair to criticise them for not living up to a genius who has defied belief with the most spectacular batting in cricket history but De Villiers has become the benchmark now for everyone else to attempt to emulate.

We are lucky he is a cricketer at all. De Villiers grew up in Pretoria playing hockey, football, rugby, tennis and badminton to international standard at age-group level while also being an accomplished sprinter and swimmer.

These days, in his spare time, he plays golf off scratch on top of being an all-round cricketer who keeps wicket, bowls and fields to a high level for his country as well as indisputably the best limited-overs batsman in the world. Give him the throne of Albania and he would surpass even the legendary CB Fry.

And those who have suggested the current England team may be a bit too nice to succeed in this tournament might like to note that it is hard to find anyone with a bad word to say about De Villiers. Perhaps the suggestion of a receding hair-line, at the age of 31, is his only nod towards mortality.

De Villiers has been around for 10 years now at the highest level but it is with two particular innings in the last two months that he has breathed life into the 50-over format and re-written the rules on what can be possible.

First, against the West Indies in Johannesburg in January, De Villiers reached three figures in just 31 balls, going from nought to a hundred in 40 minutes and smashing 16 sixes, the same number as India's Rohit Sharma during his record-breaking 264 against Sri Lanka.

Then, in this World Cup, he demolished the poor, hapless West Indians again with an extraordinary unbeaten 162, racing from a hundred to 150 in just 12 balls. De Villiers now holds the records for the fastest 50, 100 and 150 in one-day international history. South Africa, at one stage looking set for a total of around 270, instead made the small matter of 408 for five. Extraordinary.

De Villiers does not look particularly powerful, as Chris Gayle does, nor stocky and pugnacious like David Warner and Aaron Finch. There is plenty that is orthodox about his methods but also an incredible ability to hit full-length balls outside of off-stump to the leg-side for six.

When he is in full flow he is a joy to behold and for a while, against Pakistan on Saturday, he looked capable of winning the match on his own until that thin edge saw his side consigned to defeat. South Africa are a notoriously fragile tournament team but in their captain they have a man capable of taking them all the way to the final.

The lesson for England to absorb is that the pioneers of this new impossible is nothing brand of one-day cricket are basically playing Twenty20 over 50 overs. Even now, while all evidence points to a different approach, they still prefer to treat a one-day international as a shortened Test innings.

They do have the players capable of doing it the modern way, that's the frustration of England's World Cup so far. None more so than Jos Buttler, whose eyes positively lit up when asked if the World Cup had been exciting him.

'Definitely,' said Buttler. 'AB de Villiers is I someone I look at who has played some amazing knocks. Cricket's changed. The introduction of the IPL and Twenty20, people are coming up with things and the hitting at the end is nothing short of spectacular.

'As a fan of cricket you watch these guys perform at the top of their profession and you take a step back and enjoy it. De Villiers has been fantastic to watch. Brendon McCullum faced two guys who were bowling at 90 miles per hour (against Australia) and was swinging even harder. There's been some great moments as a fan to sit and watch and enjoy.'

Sadly not many of them have involved England but what comes next is clear, whether they scrape into the knockout stages or not. England simply have to rip it up and start again in one-day cricket and build a new side around the likes of Buttler, Joe Root, Moeen Ali and those coming through like Jason Roy and Sam Billings.

De Villiers has shown what is possible. Now England have to play catch up. And fast.
