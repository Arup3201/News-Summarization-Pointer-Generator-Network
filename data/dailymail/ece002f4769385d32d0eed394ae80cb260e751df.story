The average income across Australia's 9.3 million households is $145,000, a 2.4 per cent increase from the same time last year, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.

An IBISWorld analysis of the figures found that Australians spend more than a quarter of their total income just on taxes and rent.

Non-durable goods - such as food, alcohol, clothing and utilities – are the single biggest outlay at 16.9 percent of expenditure.

Following that is capital related expenditure at 12.3 percent, financial and institutional services at 8.1 percent, savings at 7 percent, and entertainment at 6.3 percent.

Expenditure on health made up just 4 percent of the total average.

The total income across all households is around $1.4 trillion, which is made up of wages, mixed incomes (of unincorporated businesses), investment incomes, welfare payments, transfer payments, other incomes and the imputed rent value of home ownership.

The analysis also found that in 2014, Australians are spending and average of $34,600 per household on outsourced household services – such as meals, holidays, cleaning, child minding, entertainment, financial advice and health services – which is more than  expenditure on non-durables.

But the average wealth of households has also continued to rise.

ABS figures show that the net worth of households was $750,000 on average in the middle of 2013.

Surprisingly, property (including homes, investment housing and other property) made up just under half of average net worth.

Superannuation and other financial products, such as shares and deposits, made up 45.6 percent of average net worth.
