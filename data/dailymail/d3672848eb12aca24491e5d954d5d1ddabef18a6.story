If anyone in your house is already bubbling with excitement about their high school prom, you might want to hide this article.

It could give them some rather expensive ideas.

Crowds gathered to see the Barbie dolls arrived at the prom before they step out in perfect condition

It’s every girls dream to make a 
spectacular entrance on their prom night, but these girls certainly win 
the crown by arriving encased in life-sized Barbie doll packaging, 
despite being pulled along by a rather unglamorous trailer.

Emily Pounde and Hannah Jagger, both 16, finished off their princess look of ballgowns, tiaras and flowing hair by arriving inside the home-made plywood and Perspex boxes, complete with Mattel branding, to mimic their childhood idol.

The
 boxes were made in just two days by Emily's mum Christine Pounde at a 
cost of £250 after the girls discussed ways to stand out from the crowd.

On the big night the boxes were 
loaded onto a flat-bed trailer and the dressed-up girls climbed inside 
for a carnival-style tour of Crewkerne in Somerset, to cheers from 
amazed onlookers.

Emily said: ‘Hannah and I thought of the idea together and it suddenly became reality when mum liked it too.

‘We wanted to do something different and I really loved Barbies when I was little.'

The
 pair, who attend Wadham School in Crewkerne, Somerset then stole the 
show when they arrived at Haselbury Mill, the country house venue of 
their prom where their Year 11 pals were waiting.

But the girls weren't the only eye-catching attendee at the school's 2012 prom.

Their fellow pupils competed to arrive in the most unusual and outrageous way possible.

Family, friends and local residents 
looked on in amazement as a cavalcade of bizarre vehicles made their way
 to the glamorous event, including a Union Jack Mini and a Massey Ferguson
 tractor.

Two girls even rolled up the driveway in a fully-functioning ice-cream van.

While the boys rose to the challenge, one group opting for a vintage Rolls Royce and a sporty Ariel Atom.

Their Barbie outfits may have won 
prizes for creativity, but Emily Pounde and Hannah Jagger failed to pass
 muster when it came to their chosen mode of transport.

The girls, who were also joined by Lauren's dad, Jason Huggett, enjoyed a 30 minute ride before being dropped off at the Whitminster Inn, Gloucestershire for their prom

Family friend Adam Dance towed them on a trailer hitched on to the back of his white Vauxhall Corsa.

But the girls were not focusing on the transport, but on their elobrate boxes.

Emily
 added: 'We took a big long drive to show off the boxes, people on the 
streets were wondering what was happening because they could only see 
the car at first, but when they saw us their jaws dropped.

'It was the same with people at school, they were only focusing on the boxes, not the trailer.'

Earlier this week best friends Chloe Webb and 
Lauren Huggett, told how they flew by helicopter to
 their end-of-year party.

The girls had hoped to get a limo to the
 event, but when they discovered they were all booked Lauren's dad Jason
 Huggett booked them a £500 chopper to drop them off at at the 
Whitminster Inn, Gloucestershire.

In a scene more akin to the US high 
school prom-craze, the two girls touched down outside the venue and 
stepped out in their ballgowns wowing their shocked school friends.

Parents spend an average of £229 on top-to-toe preparations for their daughter’s US-inspired prom.

The extent of the American high school
 prom influence means more than one in eight teens expect a prom on a 
par with hit TV shows such as My Super Sweet 16 and Glee.

One in nine parents have paid for 
their teenager to have a spray tan before the party, while one in 12 
have paid for a sunbed session.

And a worrying seven per cent of the parents polled have even forked out for their children to have pre-prom cosmetic surgery.

Other fancy treatments lavished on 
teens include professional hairstyles, fish, hair removal and facials, 
according to a poll of more than 1,000 parents with children aged 
between 11 and 18 by Sheilas’ Wheels home insurance.

While daughters rack up the largest bill for parents, sons still set their parents back £185

The average cost of a prom:

TOTAL = £209
