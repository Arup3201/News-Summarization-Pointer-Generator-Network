Two teenagers are facing criminal action after taking part in a 'dare' to engage in a sex act inside the school cafeteria at lunch - while another student filmed the incident on a smartphone.

The first-year-students at Etowah High School in Woodstock, Georgia have been charged with public indecency after the incident, which happened on October 10.

School spokeswoman Barbara Jacoby said a female student had allegedly 'made a sexual offer to a male classmate during lunch'.

Gawker.com reported the male student involved initially believed the offer to be a joke.

Ms Jacoby's statement said the male student later claimed that 'when the female student began to act upon it... he stopped her.'

Students at the school said the girl had been 'dared' into performing the act.

One pupil told WSB-TV that a video of the act started to circulate around the school shortly after it took place.

'The guy who recorded it, he sent it to people... a lot (of people),' the student said.

Another added: 'I don’t think it’s a responsible thing to do, but knowing our generation, you know, we don’t really think before we act and we just send it off.'

A third student told the TV channel that the students 'stacked up a bunch of books and book bags' around them, to hide their behaviour. She added: 'Students at the next table had no idea what was going on.'

The TV channel reported the teenagers, not named because they are under the age of 18, have not returned to class since the incident.

The school confirmed they have been charged with misdemeanor public indecency and Ms Jacoby added: 'appropriate school disciplinary action also will occur'.

The statement said: 'Two juvenile Etowah High School students were charged with misdemeanor public indecency for an incident that occurred on October 10.

'Appropriate school disciplinary action will also occur.'

When asked where adult teachers were at the time, the spokeswoman told 11Alive that only six to eight employees staff the cafeteria during lunch and are mostly there to ensure students do not leave.
