These photos capture the incredible moment two photographers enter a cave believed to have frozen for the very first time.

The unique pictures were taken during a rare deep freeze in Alabama at a cave called Neversink, where a waterfall usually cascades down the rocks.

In temperatures approaching -15C the water was frozen with stunning ice stalagmites, stalactites, flowstone, and other frozen formations.

The photos were taken by photographer and explorer Amy Hinkle and cave explorer Jon Mnich.

Amy said: ‘We had to be careful, as some ground water was still trickling and occasionally loosened some of these massive ice formations causing them to come crashing down, shattering ice everywhere.

‘It is highly unusual for caves here in the typically sunny south to freeze, we rarely see snow, and winter temperatures usually do not go below freezing.

‘We usually shop for Christmas presents still in T-shirts and shorts - but with this deep freeze, everything is frozen.’
