Explosive scenes: Dame Helen Mirren plays the Queen in the Broadway production of The Audience

It is one of the most extraordinary confrontations in recent British political history.

The Queen pleads with Tony Blair to call off the planned 2003 invasion of Iraq in a fraught private audience at Buckingham Palace, imploring him to seek a diplomatic solution from the United Nations. 

But with British forces poised to join the US in bombing and ground assaults the next day, he says: ‘The right thing to do is to go in now, and go in hard.’

This explosive scene is in a new Broadway production of controversial play The Audience, with Dame Helen Mirren as the Queen.

Publicity material for the play says it will ‘break the contract of silence’ around private audiences between the Queen and her Prime Ministers. It describes the meetings as both ‘intimate’ and ‘explosive’.

It’s the first time Blair has been in the play, written by Peter Morgan and directed by Stephen Daldry. It ran in London depicting meetings with seven Prime Ministers including Churchill and David Cameron.

Royal experts denounced a scene suggesting the Queen had a negative view of the invasion. She asks Blair: ‘You don’t want to give it more time?’ 

A defiant Prime Minister says it will lead to the overthrow of a tyrant and the creation of democracy, saying: ‘We confidently predict liberated Iraqis will cheer our soldiers through the streets after a short, sharp and easy campaign.’

Blair refers to bombing taking place ‘tomorrow’, placing the alleged meeting on March 19, 2003, the day before the Allies launched their ‘shock and awe’ campaign. But the court circular, which lists the Queen’s official engagements, makes no reference to the meeting.

The discrepancy will increase pressure on Morgan to justify claims in the play, which premiered in London in 2013 and is to return to the capital this year. 

The playwright, now working on a £100 million blockbuster about the Royal Family called The Crown, has never revealed his sources, saying much of it was based on ‘anecdotal information’. 

He said: ‘If transcripts exist, I’m confident she’d emerge with credit.’ 

But historian and constitutional expert Andrew Roberts last night said: ‘The idea the Queen would oppose the war because she is the Left-wing conscience of the nation is rubbish. It is easy for playwrights to impose Left-wing views on the Queen, secure they will not be denounced.’

The scene is controversial because Britain’s case for war, including Blair’s close relationship with President George W Bush, the ‘dodgy dossier’ of evidence of Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction and the legal advice of former Attorney General, Lord Goldsmith, are all under scrutiny in the long-delayed Chilcot Inquiry.

Roberts said last night: ‘There is no sense the Queen would be with people opposing the Iraq War on the streets. 

BLAIR: We confidently predict that liberate Iraqis will cheer our soldiers through the streets after a short, sharp and easy campaign

QUEEN: [pleading] You don’t want to give it more time? Just get back to the United Nations and see that a diplomatic solution can be reached

BLAIR: [insistent] No ma’am, the right thing to do is go in now, and go in hard

'She would have intelligence reports people demonstrating on the streets wouldn’t have. She is close to the Armed Services. Her family understands military dangers.’

Constitutional expert Professor Vernon Bogdanor, who advised on the original production, said the Queen prized the confidential meetings and would probably distance herself from anyone who betrayed a confidence. But he called the play’s depictions of the audiences as highly plausible, as was the idea the Queen could ask a question about Iraq.

He said: ‘I think her manner is to ask questions rather than to argue.

‘She might have asked, do you not think it a good idea to go to the UN? He might have said no. But I think Mr Blair would have been more deferential.’ Royal biographer Penny Junor said: ‘I suspect the Queen would voice concerns. That’s what she’s there for.’

It is not clear if the scene will be in the London revival this year, with Kristin Scott Thomas in the title role. Buckingham Palace declined to comment, as did a spokesman for Tony Blair. Morgan and Daldry were unavailable for comment.
