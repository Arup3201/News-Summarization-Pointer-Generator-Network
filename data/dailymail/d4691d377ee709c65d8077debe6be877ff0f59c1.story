Broncos star Peyton Manning's throwing days may be coming to an end with the star quarterback giving his strongest indication yet that he may not return for another season. 

Manning failed to fire against the Indianapolis Colts yesterday barely completing just half of his passes which resulted in one touchdown and only 211 passing yards, in his team's 24.13 defeat.

The Broncos bid for Super Bowl redemption, having being defeated by the Seattle Sehawks last year, is now over.

Andrew Luck of the Indianapolis Colts meets Manning following the Bronco's defeat yesterday 

The Colts will now take on the New England Patriots next Sunday for the American Football Conference crown and spot in the February 1 Super Bowl in Arizona.

Manning, 38, who in December seemed sure he wanted to take to the field next season, was less certain after yesterday's loss, Deadspin reports. 

Manning said he would take time to figure out what he wanted to do, and in a post game press conference he reportedly said: 'Yeah my mindset right now is just disappointment after today's game. 

'Dave Logan asked me about it after the game, and like I said, I didn't have a great answer for him. 

'So I'm disappointed. I kind of need to process this game and we'll meet tomorrow. I need to process this game.'

A clearly disappointed Manning leaves the field following the Bronco's 48-8 Super Bowl loss to the Seahawks last year; the Broncos had hoped to make up for the defeat this season 

The Denver franchise is built around Manning, but he is one of many key personnel who may leave the team.

There have been reports that head coach John Fox could leave or be fired, and both offensive coordinator Adam Gase and defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio are being courted for other coaching roles.

Wide receiver Demaryius Thomas and tight end Julius Thomas are about to come off contract, and defensive tackle Terrance Knighton and safety Rahim Moore could leave for more lucrative contracts.
