The BBC’s most senior woman executive took her solicitor to the Proms at public expense after paying him thousands of pounds of licence fee money to represent her during the Savile scandal.

Helen Boaden, head of radio, invited lawyer Louis Charalambous to join her in a private box at the music festival last month in what insiders have labelled a publicly funded ‘thank you’.

Mr Charalambous represented Ms Boaden during last year’s Pollard Review, the £3 million BBC inquiry into the Jimmy Savile affair, and is credited with helping to save her BBC career.

Splashing out: Helen Boaden took Louis Charalambous to the Proms on September 4 as a publicly funded 'thank you'. She accepted more 'freebies' than any other executive from the public purse during the festival

During the probe, Boaden was given £101,000 of legal advice which licence payers had to fund.

As a result of the scandal, Ms Boaden was forced out of her previous job, head of BBC news, after being criticised for her poor management skills.

She was appointed BBC radio chief instead and is now paid £340,000 per year.

Details of the Proms evening came in a Freedom of Information response showing BBC bosses spent £31,212 entertaining friends, partners, colleagues, politicians and showbusiness personalities at the concerts.

Plus ones: Labour's Luciana Berger and Sir Jonathan Evans, former head of MI5, were also on Ms Boaden's extensive list of guests in the box, as well as Vanessa Feltz. Her Proms bill came to £8,639 over 14 nights

Ms Boaden hosted and co-hosted guests on 14 nights — far outstripping any other senior BBC figure.

Her Proms bill came to £8,639. Mr Charalambous joined her on September 4.

Others in the box that night, which cost £714, included ex-BBC chief Lord Birt.

Over the summer her other guests included Labour MP Luciana Berger, ex-MI5 chief Sir Jonathan Evans and radio presenter Vanessa Feltz.

More than 60 of the highest-paid BBC employees accepted a free ticket, including Sir Bruce Forsyth, Jeremy Paxman, Fiona Bruce, Professor Brian Cox, James Naughtie and Alan Yentob.

Jeremy Paxman was one of a number of BBC employees to accept free tickets to concerts this year

Bruce Forsyth, alongside Fiona Bruce, Professor Brian Cox, James Naughtie and Alan Yentob, received tickets

Most were allowed a plus-one.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘The BBC Proms is the world’s largest classical music festival and a major cultural event managed and broadcast by the BBC.

‘Money raised from tickets and programmes goes towards the running costs of the festival.

'It is appropriate that the event is used for hospitality, given that it is managed and run by the BBC.’
