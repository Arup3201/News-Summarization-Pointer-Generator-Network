Selfies, shots of legs on sun loungers, cocktails in the sunset ... social media users can be overwhelmed by a sense of 'déjà vu' while scrolling through other people's holiday photographs.

And if your latest photo album contains 127 landscape shots, 45 selfies, five images of strangers and six stray cats, you've had the most run-of-the-mill summer break, according to new research.

An online travel agency quizzed British holidaymakers about their latest photo collection to determine the most popular subject for their camera lens.

'Wish you were here?' If you can combine a selfie with a group shot and a landscape, you're on to a winner

The 'hotdog legs' trend of snapping your extremities while lying on the beach is very much a part of the modern holiday and is favourite with celebrities

Of the 2,176 people questioned by www.sunshine.co.uk, 89 per cent said they took photographs on their last holiday, using either a smartphone (66 per cent), camera (42 per cent) or a tablet device (27 per cent).

The average photo collection contained 447 images, with just 216 of these images making it on to people's social media pages. 

The majority never get printed out: when asked whether their holiday photos ever made it into physical albums or photo frames, 76 per cent of people said ‘no, they stay in digital format forever’.

The holidaymakers were then asked to analyse their latest photo collection and describe how many of each type of picture they’d taken.

Landscape shots proved the most popular subject matter, accounting for a total of 127 images. 

In second place was images of the resort (62), followed by selfies (45) and portrait shots of fellow travellers (38).

The camera lens was also trained on the local wildlife (33), swimming pools (26) and local landmarks (21).

Facebook friends were 'treated' to 27 images of food and drink, 16 shots of the hotel room and 10 photos of legs on a sun lounger.

But 31 images were either blurred or blank.

And the average photo collection also bizarrely contained five pictures of strangers and six of stray cats.

Chris Clarkson, Managing Director of sunshine.co.uk said: 'I think it’s really important to take holiday photos, because having those memories to look back on and share with friends and family is great.

'Holiday selfies are clearly very popular, as are landscape shots of beaches and scenery. 

'People should just make sure that they don’t spend too much of their holiday stuck behind a camera lens, as it is better to actually be looking around and enjoying your surroundings!

'As for those photos of stray cats and strangers, perhaps those holidaymakers should point their cameras towards the sunset or their next cocktail instead!'
