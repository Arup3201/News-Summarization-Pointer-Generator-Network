Real Madrid have won the race to sign Brazilian midfielder Lucas Silva from Cruzeiro, according to reports in the Spanish press.

The European champions, who on Wednesday announced they had reached an agreement with Stromsgodset to acquire 16-year-old Norwegian forward Martin Odegaard, are also on the verge of completing a move for Silva.

The defensive midfielder had been linked with a move to Arsenal where manager Arsene Wenger is a known admirer.

The Cruzeiro defensive midfielder has reportedly agreed to join Los Blancos for a fee of £11.5m

Spanish sports newspaper Marca claimed on Thursday that Real have reached an agreement with Cruzeiro to sign the Brazilian starlet for a reported 15million euros.

Silva, 21, will pen a six-and-a-half year contract with the Merengue and will be unveiled next week.

The South American player had been linked to Real since August, with the Madrid outfit looking for a replacement for Xabi Alonso, who joined Bayern Munich last summer.

Silva has been linked with a host of Premier League sides - including Arsenal - during the last few months, but the player revealed he is keen on a move to the Spanish capital.
