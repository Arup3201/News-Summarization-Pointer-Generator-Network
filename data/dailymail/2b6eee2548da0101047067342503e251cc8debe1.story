They are no doubt far too young to know who Basil Fawlty is.

But after their assembly last week, the pupils of Horsmonden Primary School in Kent certainly know all about some of his more memorable characteristics.

They watched open-mouthed as their headmaster ‘snapped’ when the electronic organ he was trying to play refused to work. Enraged, Malcolm Hayes smashed and punched the keyboard before wrenching it off its stand and telling his pupils to follow him as he stormed outside.

Temper: Head Malcolm Hayes, 49, is on sick leave after losing his cool with an electric organ during assembly

Once in the carpark the 49-year-old, a
devout Christian, smashed the instrument again – before jumping in his 
car and repeatedly driving over it.

The mother of one of the frightened 
children compared Mr Hayes to John Cleese’s infamously short-tempered 
character in Fawlty Towers.

She said: ‘When my child came home 
that day and told me what had happened, I couldn’t believe it. I called 
around other parents to find out what had gone on.

‘But they were all saying the same 
thing. It sounds like he’s had a complete breakdown in front of the kids
– it’s like he’s just gone mad. One minute he was playing the organ, 
the next he’s smashing the keys and behaving really aggressively.

‘It’s a primary school, so some of the
children didn’t really understand if it was all part of some show, but 
by the time he was revving his car and crushing the organ, a few were 
quite scared. I imagined him looking like Basil Fawlty when he thrashed 
his car in Fawlty Towers with a tree branch.’

The wedding of Malcolm Hayes and Rhoxan. He is 22 years older than her and they started their affair in 2001

Rhoxan and headmaster Mr Hayes. He left his wife of 10 years Paula and was allowed to carry on teaching

It is not the first time Mr Hayes has
landed himself in trouble. He made headlines in 2001 when he left his 
wife Paula, 48, to set up home with their 16-year-old foster daughter, 
Rhoxan Kenward.

He was allowed to continue in his role
as headmaster at Horsmonden and has since married Rhoxan, now 28, with 
whom he has two children.

But neighbours said they believed Mr 
Hayes had recently moved out of the family home, prompting speculation 
that marital problems could have led to the outburst.

It is understood several parents 
complained to the school and an internal investigation has been launched
by the board of governors. Mr Hayes has since taken medical leave.

Dis-chord: An electric organ, similar to the one Mr Hayes destroyed

One mother of a child who saw the incident said it reminded her of Basil Fawlty attacking his car with a tree

Mrs Hayes, who runs her own floristry business, was 15 when she moved from a 
Barnardo’s residential home in Hastings to live with her new foster 
parents – Mr Hayes and his then wife – in their four-bedroom home in 
Eastbourne, East Sussex.

But Mr Hayes embarked on an affair 
with her. When it was discovered, he was arrested and suspended over 
allegations of under-age sex.

No charges were brought, however, as Mrs Hayes had already turned 16 and was no longer officially a foster child.

Kent County Council said it was ‘providing support’.

A statement said: ‘Malcolm Hayes is on
medical leave at the moment and it would be inappropriate to discuss 
the circumstances surrounding his leave.'
