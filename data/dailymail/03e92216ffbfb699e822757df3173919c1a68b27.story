Parents have expressed anger over a decision made by a handful of Victorian schools to change the time of commemoration on Remembrance Day.

Melbourne-based radio station 3AW were flooded with calls on Tuesday morning from frustrated callers who hit out at the primary and secondary schools that made the move.

Schools gave a few reasons for the change, which included that the minute's silence clashed with morning tea and Year 12 exams,The Age reported.

This comes as people across the nation pause on Remembrance Day to herald the courage, heroism and sacrifice of Australian war veterans, while the world commemorates the armistice that ended World War I. 

Thousands gathered at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra and in public ceremonies across the country on Tuesday to hold a minute's silence and recognise the service of Australia's fallen diggers.

Despite the minute's silence being traditionally observed at 11am, a mother told 3AW the south-eastern Melbourne school her child attended moved the commemoration time by 10 minutes to 10.50am 'so it doesn't interfere with morning tea time'.

While a Year 12 student said he would be protesting his school's delay by marking the significant time by himself during his Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE) chemistry test in the state capital's west.

The class of 2014 will be taking the exam from 9am to 11.45am, which is thought to be the first time it has ever coincided with the minute's silence.

A principal at one of the schools that made the move said he had applied to the state's Returned Services League for permission to shift the time.

But it seems the RSL Victoria Branch did not get the message.

Chief executive Michael Arnett said they had not received any correspondence requesting the change.

'There should be scope [to observe the minute's silence] regardless of the activity you're engaging in,' he told Fairfax Media.

But the minute's silence was more timely observed across Australia on Tuesday. 

In Canberra, former prime minister John Howard delivered a speech to honour those who have lost their lives defending the country, and paid tribute to the 'great professional valour' of Australia's current serving troops.

This year marks the 96th anniversary of the end of World War I. Allied forces signed a peace accord with the Germans in France on November 11, 1918, signalling the end of the first Great War.

'We honour two things, first and foremost, the extraordinary sacrifice (of those) who died in defence of this country,' Mr Howard said.

 'We also honour those who go to war to defend the vulnerable and the values for which this country has always stood.' 

Mr Howard told the crowd soldiers currently heading to Iraq stood on the shoulders of the Anzacs.

'As we contemplate that mission and we understand the extraordinary heroism that will be involved and the great professional valour that will be accompanying the men and women of the Australian Defence Force as they go on their task, let us remember that they stand on the shoulders of their Anzac forebears,' he said.

'They carry in their mission the same values of this country as did their forebears.' 

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten was among those dignitaries to pay their respects to the fallen diggers

Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who is in Beijing for an APEC summit, issued his Remembrance Day message saying it was about remembering the courage, achievements, pain and loss of all who have served in our name. 

'This Remembrance Day marks 96 years since the guns fell silent at the end of The Great War. The Great War was the crucible in which our nation's identity was forged,' he said in the recorded message. 

'From a population of under five million, 417,000 enlisted, 332,000 served overseas, 152,000 were wounded and 61,000 never came home,' he said.

'It was sacrifice on a stupendous scale. Every November 11, Australia renews its vow to never forget the sacrifice.

'We pause to remember the suffering and loss that has occurred in all wars, for we are a country of memory, as well as memorials.

'Today, we will remember the courage, achievements, pain and loss of all who have served in our name.

'And we draw strength from their memory.'

Mr Abbott along with New Zealand Prime Minister John Key attended a ceremony in China's capital.
