A fish and chip shop is offering customers a variety of battered Christmas treats to enjoy over the festive period – including deep fried mince pies.

Mister Eaters Eating Emporium, in Ribbleton, near Preston, Lancashire, is also selling deep fried Ferrero Rochers and Christmas puddings this December.

The shop was visited by Heston Blumenthal last year, and its culinary creations rival the celebrity chef for their originality.

John Clarkson's shop is offering the deep fried Christmas treats as well as its usual offering, fish and chips

John Clarkson, 54, who runs the shop with his wife Corinne, 39, concentrates on 
mince pies in December, but also offers battered Tunnock’s Teacakes and 
deep fried cheesecake through the year.

The mince pies sell for 80p each - or £1.30 with cream or ice cream - and, along with the Ferrero Rochers, are very popular over the Christmas period.

‘I do ask people if they want salt and vinegar on their mince pies and Christmas pud as a joke, and they just look at me,’ said Mr Clarkson.

‘They don’t know what to say – is it wrong or is it right?’

While Ferrero Rochers are a new invention for the shop, Mr Clarkson has perfected the frying of mince pies over a decade.

Blumenthal, who visited the shop while filming for Channel 4’s Fantastical Food, also specialises in deep fried mince pies, but Mr Clarkson believes his shop has been doing it for longer.

Asked how they taste, he said: ‘Fantastic – and I’m not just saying that.’

Mr Clarkson, who has run the shop over 25 years, said mince pies along with Ferrero Rochers are the shop’s most popular deep fried products because Christmas puddings ‘aren’t for everyone’.

Asked why the shop started selling deep fried mince pies, he said: 'You have to be different to be noticed - and they do sell as well.'

He also predicted the sweet battered treats could catch on in the rest of the country in the future.

On the new Ferrero Rocher invention, Mrs Clarkson said:  ‘Both myself and John have tried both and so have all the staff. We all firmly agree that they are a great taste sensation. So wrong - yet so right.

'The very idea of them puts a smile on your face, imagine what the taste will do.

‘It’s winter, it’s cold, it’s dark, we’re in a double dip recession, all things Christmas should be celebrated, food with a sense of humour? It’s a no brainer.’

The deep fried mince pies sell for 80p - or £1.30 when served with cream or ice cream
