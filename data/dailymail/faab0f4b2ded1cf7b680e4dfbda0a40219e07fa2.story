Seventy years ago today Britain’s first front-line jet fighter took to the skies at the height of the Second World War.

Almost 4,000 Meteors were built and they were exported to serve with countries around the world during a time when Britain truly ruled the skies.

And this month one of the last Meteors still in airworthy condition – the oldest flyable British jet in the world – will take to the air over Cornwall to mark the opening of a new museum at Newquay Airport, the former RAF St Mawgan.

Seventy years ago today Britain's first front-line jet fighter - the Gloster Meteor -  took to the skies at the height of the Second World War

The Gloster Meteor was the Allies’ first operational jet, with sorties starting in July 1944 with 616 Squadron.

Designed by George Carter, the prototype took off in secrecy from RAF Cranwell in Lincolnshire on March 5, 1943.

Meteors were first based at RAF Culmhead in Somerset but were soon moved to Manston in Kent, closer to the action above occupied Europe and ready to intercept the dreaded German Luftwaffe.

The aircraft was quickly sent up to combat the menace of V-1 flying bombs, pilotless pulse-jet projectiles that were the forerunners of today’s cruise missiles.

They were fired from the Continent to later crash to earth over southern England. With a top speed of more than 400mph, Meteors notched up their first ‘kills’ of V-1s in August 1944.

Initially created as a single-seater, pilots used to piston-engined, propeller-driven aircraft had to quickly get to grips with their new Meteors.

Many aircrew would be instantly taken by the lack of the spinning propeller they were used to seeing at the front of their Spitfires and Hurricane fighters. They were also amazed at the quieter engines – at least from the cockpit; the noise outside being deafening to bystanders.

By 1949 dual controlled Meteors were being produced which enabled flying instructors to ease the transition from propeller to jet aircraft.

By the end of the war 16 RAF squadrons were equipped with Meteor F3s and soon after the F4 version was flown, which was 170mph faster than its predecessor. By 1951 there were 20 RAF squadrons flying the Meteor and it became one of the best-loved aircraft in the air force inventory.

Legendary post-war test pilot Bill Waterton, in his memoirs The Quick and the Dead, described his first impression of the new jet fighters as a poor one, saying the low-powered early variants ‘often seemed touch and go whether they would take off or not’.

But he grew to appreciate the aircraft’s qualities as it developed into a fine flying machine.

'After the noise of orthodox 'planes, they seemed to slide through the air in an uncanny, effortless silence,' he said.

For a short while after the war Gloster's Meteors were the best-performing aircraft in the world and were an export success, being ordered by air forces across the globe.

Waterton described it as a ‘wonder plane’.

‘It had the fastest speed and climb, the best manoeuvrability, and the highest ceiling of any production aircraft in the world,’ he said.

Today only a handful of Meteors remain in airworthy condition.

One is flown as a trials aircraft by British firm Martin Baker, which makes ejection seats for airforces around the world. Another flies in Australia.And two are looked after by the Classic Air Force, at the Newquay museum.

Besides its T.7 training machine, the museum formerly known as Air Atlantique when based at Coventry Airport operates a rare NF.11 night fighter which was one of the first vintage jets to be flown in private hands.

Classic Air Force, which operates as a charity, is due to open its doors to the public on Good Friday, March 29. It will be the biggest visitor attraction to open in the south west since the Eden Project in 2003.

Boasting 25 aircraft, some of its aeroplanes are regular attractions at airshows across Britain. Some will be available for paying passenger flights.

Group Captain Davie Paton OBE RAF retd, the chief executive of the Classic Air Force said: ‘The Meteor is one of the most iconic of all British aircraft and paved the way for generations of jet fighters.

Here at the Classic Air Force we operate the last flyable example of the Meteor Night Fighter as well as a two-seat T.7 trainer variant.

The aeroplane was built in 1949, making it the oldest flyable British jet in the world.’

Tim Skeet, chairman of the Classic Aircraft Trust, explains the charity was set up in 2012 to ensure the continued operation of the Meteors and several other classic British aircraft in the skies over the UK.

He said: ‘Keeping Meteors and other survivors of this era flying is our key objective.

It is vital that these aircraft are not lost overseas and can be an inspiration to future generations of pilots and engineers. They really are the last link to an era when Britain ruled the skies.’
