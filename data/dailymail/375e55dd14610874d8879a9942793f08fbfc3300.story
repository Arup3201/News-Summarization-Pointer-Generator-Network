Accused: Madison High School custodian Jamaal Winchester has accused the school's former vice principal Liz Wilson, pictured, of taking steps to have him transferred because he ended their affair

A high school custodian has accused the former vice principal of having him transferred because he ended their affair.

Jamaal Winchester, 33, has filed a sexual harassment complaint against Liz Wilson, saying she stalked him and took steps to have him temporarily moved to another school with fewer working hours as punishment.

'The reason I was transferred was 
because I rejected Ms. Wilson's advances,' he wrote in his filing with 
the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries (BOLI). 'She knew I needed overtime hours and knew I 
needed my job.'

The Oregonian reported the pair worked together at Madison High School in Portland, Oregon.

They secretly started dating in January and Winchester moved in with Wilson.

He was in a long-term relationship with the mother of his children at the same time.

But a month later, the district found out about the affair and the couple were called into the principal's office.

That's when Winchester 'left Ms. Wilson’s house and returned to the mother of his children,' the complaint says.

But Winchester, 33, alleges his former lover wouldn't let it go, and kept calling, texting and visiting him to get back together.

'Ms. Wilson approached Mr. Winchester nearly every day during work in the cafeteria to tell him that he should reconsider his decision about their relationship,' Winchester claims. 'One evening, Ms. Wilson called Mr. Winchester around midnight and, when Mr. Winchester did not answer, left a voicemail saying, 'What a n*****'.'

This is Madison High School in Oregon where Jamaal Winchester claims the sexual harassment occurred

The couple briefly took up their relationship again.

Then, in late February, when Winchester went to visit his children, Wilson allegedly followed him in a car. After confronting her, he moved out of her house.

But Winchester said his fling continued to make contact, even though he insisted they just stay friends. He claimed Wilson continually approached him at school and claims his supervisor was aware of the 'harassment'.

In March, Winchester and the mother of his children encountered Wilson and a friend at a restaurant.

Wilson alleges Winchester and his companion yelled at her and called her a home-wrecker, according to The Oregonian.

Wilson then filed a restraining order against Winchester.

Although the claim was dismissed on April 1, Winchester says the damage was done.

He had been transferred to another school and given 20 less working hours a week. Winchester was allowed to return to Madison on August 26.

The custodian also alleges the district delayed his return to Madison in retaliation for the initial sexual harassment complaint.

Wilson has been transferred to Marysville School, a Southeast Portland K-8 building, where she is  the assistant principal.

Winchester said the district painted Wilson's transfer in a positive light, whereas he felt humiliated.

BOLI is investigating the case, which was filed in June.

In a statement, Portland Public Schools Chief Human Resources Officer Sean Murray said the district 'addressed the matter appropriate to the circumstances with both employees at the conclusion of its investigations.'

'As this is a personnel matter, the district has no further information to provide at this time,' he wrote.

Winchester’s attorney, Jon Weiner, said his client believed it was unfair he was being punished for ending the relationship.

'The district really aided and abetted that when the district had an opportunity to make everything right in a timely manner,' he said, according to The Oregonian.

Weiner said Winchester will  =pursue a lawsuit unless the district settles.
