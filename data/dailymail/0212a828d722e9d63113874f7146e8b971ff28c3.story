Amateur surfers have been branded ‘dangerous’ and blamed for putting families off visiting a beach popular with the likes of Prince Harry and David Cameron.

Novice surfers flocking to beauty spot Polzeath in Cornwall are being blasted for being ‘ignorant’ and not following ‘basic surf etiquette’.

It comes after father-of-two Steve Pratt suffered a nasty head injury after being hit by a surfboard when a holidaymaker apparently lost control of it while learning the sport.

Steve Pratt, 48, was left with a six-inch head wound after being struck by a runaway surfboard at the beach

Mr Pratt, 48, who owns a café at the popular tourist beach, was left with a six-inch wound from the incident and had to have his head glued back together at hospital.

He has now hit out at first-time surfers who flock to the region every summer to lap up the Cornish waves.

He said: ‘There’s a saying that if you don’t surf in January, don’t try to surf in July.

‘This guy just bailed before getting his wave. I don’t know why - he might have thought the wave was too big.

‘But by just jumping off his board the way he did, he sent it flying straight at me.

‘I had no chance to get out of the way - he was only feet away - and it cracked me right on the top of my head.

‘It was unbelievably painful and when I put my hand up to feel the damage, I could see straight away that I was covered in blood.

Mr Pratt, who owns a cafe at Polzeath, believes the board that hit him belonged to an inexperienced surfer

Thousands of tourists flock to Polzeath every year to make the most of the sandy beach and surfing conditions

‘There’s a basic rule, or code, that every surfer learns - you must try to keep control of your board. If he’d just held on to his board he’d have been OK and so would I.

‘Instead I ended up in A&E having to have my head glued back together.

‘Actually it could have been worse - it might have caught me in the eye, or I could have lost some teeth.

‘Fast-moving surfboards can pack quite a wallop. It’s almost scalped me.’

The beach is popular with the likes of Prime Minister David Cameron, who holidays regularly there with his family, and Prince Harry and William who were both spotted surfing at the seaside resort in 2012.

Residents now want visitors to undergo safety training before hitting the waves - to learn the equivalent of surfing’s Highway Code.

Mr Pratt said: ‘I’m 99 per cent sure that the guy was a holidaymaker who didn’t know what he was doing.

‘I know all of the locals. This guy didn’t even check to see if I was OK.

Mr Cameron has previously spoken of his love for the beach and local beer, and often visits with his family

‘I shouted at him and said “you’ve just whacked me” and put my hand up to show him the blood. I caught the next wave in and was expecting him to follow to at least see how I was but he didn’t.

‘It’s a bit like hitting someone with a car - you have a responsibility to stop and see if the other person is OK.

‘There are lots of ways to injure yourself while surfing but it’s particularly galling when you injure somebody else.

‘It’s more likely to happen when the sea is crowded and, at this time of year, the beach at Polzeath is pretty busy.

‘It’s really important that people get themselves some basic training instead of just picking up the first board they see and rushing into the sea.’

His opinion was echoed by Andy Cameron, who runs a surf school at the sandy beach.

He said: ‘It’s very important to learn the correct surfing etiquette. It’s like a Highway Code.

‘Surfing is fantastic fun and nobody wants to take away the fun element, but getting a serious injury is no fun at all.

The beach is also popular with the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry who were spotted surfing there in 2012

Prince Harry appeared to be enjoying the waves when he and friends took to their surfboards during a getaway

The beach is a popular tourist spot and many people, including the royals, travel far and wide to visit the resort

‘This accident wasn’t the first and it won’t be the last. It’s important that people have equipment which is appropriate to their level of skill and experience.

‘There are lots of ways to learn - it can be just with a friend who has got experience, it doesn’t have to be with a surf school like ours.

‘But it’s really not clever to grab hold of a board, rush straight into the ocean and treat it like a playground. That’s just asking for trouble.’

The RNLI, which has lifeguards patrolling the majority of Cornwall’s beaches, said visitors are encouraged to undertake proper training before attempting surfing for the first time.

Its website says: ‘To maximise your enjoyment and keep yourself and others safe when riding waves it’s important to understand surf etiquette.

‘If you are unsure, ask a lifeguard to explain.’
