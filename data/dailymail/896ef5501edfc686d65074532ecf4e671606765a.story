It has been released to mark one of the most important moments in British history.

But a commemorative coin depicting King John issuing Magna Carta 800 years ago has been criticised for a glaring historical inaccuracy.

Experts say that depicting the king holding the parchment charter in one hand and a quill in the other is a ‘schoolboy error’.

'Schoolboy error': The Royal Mint's £2 coin shows King John holding a quill and the Magna Carta on the 'tails' side, but a historian says it should show him using a royal seal 

Historian Dr Marc Morris used Playmobil figures show how the Magna Carta would have been signed with a royal seal - not a quill

Historian Dr Marc Morris said Magna Carta was not signed by King John, who instead would have used a wax seal to endorse and authenticate documents.

The official display mount for the £2 coin issued by the Royal Mint also shows the monarch signing the document with a quill.

But Dr Morris said: ‘To depict King John holding a quill is simply a schoolboy error.

‘Medieval kings did not authenticate documents by signing them, they did it by sealing them – or rather by getting one of their officials to do it for them. All the pen in John’s hand symbolises is ignorance of this basic fact.’

Expert opinion: Dr Morris said all the coin symbolises is 'ignorance' of facts

Dr Morris, 41, the author of books including King John: Treachery, Tyranny and the Road to Magna Carta, posted a picture on Twitter showing the scene recreated with toy Playmobil figures.

The presenter of Channel 4’s 2003 show Castle joked: ‘A far more accurate depiction of what went on at Runnymede than that produced by the Royal Mint.’

King John agreed Magna Carta at Runnymede, near Windsor, in June 1215 – a moment hailed as one of the most significant in English history.

Meaning ‘The Great Charter’, it brought an end to the unlimited power of the monarch and established the principle that everybody, including the king, was subject to the law, and had the right to fair trial.

Once sealed by the king, scribes made many copies in medieval Latin, although only four are known to have survived.

The Royal Mint defended the coin, saying it was intended to be ‘symbolic’ and not a ‘literal account of what actually occurred’. A spokesman added: ‘The design is in fact inspired by King John’s royal seal.’

Last night the coin remained on sale for £10 on the Royal Mint website, with a footnote saying: ‘The image used on this coin packaging is a well-known visual representation of historical events from the time, and not factual depiction. The Royal Mint understand that the Magna Carta was in fact witnessed and sealed by King John and not physically signed.’

The coin was designed by John Bergdahl, who also created the official coins to celebrate Prince George’s christening and a silver £20 coin to mark 100 years since the outbreak of the First World War.
