An armed robber who died when eight have-a-go heroes sat on top of him during a bungled jewellery shop raid said 'I can't breathe' shortly before his death, an inquest has heard.

Clint Townsend died when shoppers piled on top of him during a raid at Oxford's historic Covered Market in March last year.

The 33-year-old, who was wearing motorcycle gear and a helmet, had smashed the window of a jewellery shop repeatedly with a sledgehammer, before wrestling with the store's manager and owner.

Onlookers had gone to the aid of jewellery shop staff after seeing Townsend and another man attacking the store with a sledgehammer and smoke bombs.

They forced the 33-year-old would-be robber to the ground and kept him there until police arrived.

Clint Townsend was sat on by passers-by and two employees of the jewellery shop he tried to raid in the historic Covered Market, in Oxford, an inquest has heard

Mr Townsend was suspected of putting smoke bombs and smashing Gowing Goldsmith & Jewellers window with a sledgehammer when he was sat on until police arrived, a coroner was told

He was found to be unresponsive and was given emergency first aid, before being rushed to hospital, where he died the next day.

Flooring company owner Darren Maunder and his employer Oliver Lewis, who had been working in the historic covered market in Oxford, on March 30 last year, spoke of the raid at an inquest today.

Mr Lewis said that as he walked past he heard the man being held down say something like 'I can't breathe' a number of times but his voice was muffled by the helmet.

A woman bystander then said: 'I think it's just an act.'

Mr Lewis told the inquest: 'I would have thought he was using it as a get-out-of-jail-free card.'

Recalling the events, Mr Maunder said: 'We heard a mighty bang. It sounded at first like a bomb had gone off or something had gone wrong.

'We're always wary of a loud noise and I thought something had happened to one of my chaps.'

He said he and Mr Lewis went to investigate and saw a large man being pinned to the ground outside John Gowing Jewellers, a motorbike on its side and a hole in the window of the shop.

Townsend and an accomplice were dressed in motorcycle gear and had the visors of the helmets pulled down as they walked towards the jewellers pushing a stolen Kawasaki motorbike

Mr Maunders said: 'A lady said it was all under control and police were on their way.

'It didn't look like he was moving. It looked like (they were) just holding. I didn't see any punching or kicks or anything like that.'

Assistant Coroner Alison Thompson asked: 'Did anybody look as if they were using extreme force?'

Mr Maunders replied: 'No. They were just restraining him.'

The coroner asked the same question of his colleague and he too said he did not believe excessive or unreasonable force was being used.

'I thought it was kind of under control,' he said.

Both Mr Lewis and Mr Maunders said that as they watched, another man wearing paint-spattered tracksuit, looking like a painter-decorator, appeared and approached the group on the ground.

Mr Maunders said: 'He said: "Get off him, get off him".

'It was quite strange really. It was obvious he knew the guy. My impression was he was something to do with it (the robbery).

'You would never recognise the person on the ground. Why would you be telling them to get off unless you knew the person.'

The man then walked on and disappeared down an alleyway.

The Covered Market has been operating for more than 200 years in a building dating back to the 1770s 

Police were called to the scene after reports that two men had arrived at the jeweller's shop, one pushing a motorbike, and begun attacking it.

One man was hammering at the window where the highest value diamond goods were and they also threw smoke bombs into the store.

When the shop owner and manager confronted and tackled the man with the hammer, other members of the public then went to their aid, while the second raider fled.

Shortly after arriving and handcuffing the suspect and removing his motorcycle helmet police realised the man was extremely unwell and at 9.21am they called for an ambulance.

They also began attempting to resuscitate him. Townsend was taken to hospital at 9.44am but pronounced brain dead at 1.15pm the following day  and his life support system was turned off at 5pm.

The inquest into the death of Townsend, of Headington, Oxfordshire, continues.
