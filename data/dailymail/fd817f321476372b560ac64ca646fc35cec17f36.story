A television series about crime-busting Rastafarian mice on the BBC was the most complained about children's programme last year, it has been revealed.

Rastamouse attracted more than 200 complaints because of the way it 'stereotyped black people' and because of the 'patois' language
 used by the Jamaican mouse characters.

The CBeebies show, which has run for two series, attracted 13 complaints when the first episode was aired last January. There have since been 200 further complaints.

Stereotypes: The BBC show Rastamouse attracted more than 200 complaints last year

The BBC has defended the Bafta-nominated show, 
which features an all-mouse reggae band - Rastamouse and Da Easy Crew.

The puppet mouse spreads love and respect as leader of the Easycrew.

He uses patois language - and phrases such as 'me wan go' for 'I want to go' and 'wagwan' for 'what's going on?'.

The CBeebies series is aimed at children under six.

Parents have complained on Mumsnet that children using the same language as the mice could be accused of racism.

One Mumsnet user, TinyD4ncer, asked fellow users for advice on whether to stop their child watching the programme, posting: 'I dont want my DD to talk this way. Do you think I should stop her watching it?

'Wa'gwan' - What's going on

'Tings is ruff' - Things are bad

'Make a bad ting good' - Making the best of a bad situation

'Irie'  - Jamaican word meaning 'to be at total peace with your current state of being'

'Me tink me know who de t’ieving mouse may be' - I think I know who the thieveing mouse is.

'The thing I'm most worried about is her knowing/saying the words like 'rasta'.

'(I) Suppose what I'm saying is if my white child walked up to your Caribbean/Black etc child and said this, what would you feel - or nothing? - as I wouldn't want to walk away with a black eye?'

One user leaving a comment on MailOnline said: 'Frankly this programme is insulting because it uses a lazy stereotype.

'Most
 educated black people in this country who were born here speak the same
 as their white peers - some of us have cockney accents, others have RP 
accents. I am black and have an RP accent as I was the product of 
private schooling, university etc.

'Children need to lean to speak English properly and I do not understand why having this character would assist that process.

'If
 the programme makers want to introduce more diversity why not have a 
black character who speaks like a normal British born black person 
instead of a character that has a Jamaican accent.

'Surely this makes sense given that we are not living in Jamaica.'

A BBC spokeswoman said nine out of ten complaints had been about the language spoken by the characters.

She said: 'This was one of our most popular children's programmes last year.

Channel 5: Chat show The Wright Stuff received more complaints than any other TV show last year after host Matthew Wright made crass remarks about Amanda Knox and an insensitive joke about the death of a Scottish teenager

'We have had a huge amount of positive
 feedback about Rastamouse, which continues to be a hit with our young 
viewers and which was consistently in the top ten CBeebies shows viewed 
on iPlayer throughout 2011.'

None of the complaints was upheld.

The Channel 5 chat show The Wright Stuff received more complaints than any other TV show last year.

More than 2,200 viewers protested after the host of The Wright Stuff, Matthew Wright, made jokes on December 6 about the death of a Scottish teenager.

Media regulator Ofcom said this was a higher number of complaints than for any other British TV programme broadcast during 2011.

Liam Aitchison, 16, was found dead in a derelict building at Stornoway, on the Isle of Lewis, on November 29, a week after he went missing. Two men have been charged with murder.

Wright commented on the death during a newspaper review on the weekday morning show.

The presenter, whose programme was first aired in 2000, later apologised to the family of the dead boy.
