Paul Pogba is set for an extended spell on the sidelines after suffering a hamstring injury in the 27th minute against Borussia Dortmund.

Juventus confirmed the midfielder is expected to be out for 50 days after injuring his right hamstring. 

Pogba's injury could mean he misses the quarter-finals and, if the team qualify, the semi-finals too.
