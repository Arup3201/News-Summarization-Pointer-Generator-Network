UKIP could form a coalition with Labour in return for an in/out referendum on Europe, Nigel Farage said yesterday.

The leader of the anti-EU party suggested its surge in the polls could see it play a key role in deciding who governs Britain after the 2015 election.

And he ruled out coalition negotiations with David Cameron, who stoked his personal feud with Mr Farage at the weekend by describing UKIP supporters as ‘pretty odd’.

Electoral pact: The UK Independence Party could 
form a coalition with Labour in return for an in/out referendum on 
Europe if it held the balance of power after the next general election, 
its leader Nigel Farage said yesterday

‘There’s no way we could work with that man under any circumstances,’ Mr Farage said.

And, in a surprise move, he suggested a deal might be possible with Labour. That would need Ed Miliband to heed the advice of his policy chief Jon Cruddas, who is urging the Labour leader to pledge a referendum on EU membership.

Mr Miliband is nervous about such a move because he is an instinctive pro-European. But Mr Cruddas, who has signed a People’s Pledge calling for a referendum, believes a public vote on membership is now inevitable, and that Labour could steal a march on the Conservatives by offering to hold one.

Mr Farage yesterday suggested that a deal with Labour might be possible ‘if Jon Cruddas’s view prevails within the party’.

UKIP has enjoyed a dramatic rise in support over the past year, jumping from 4 per cent in the polls at the start of 2012 to 16 per cent in a poll at the weekend.

Mr Farage said party members were determined to ‘keep our feet on the ground’. He insisted he did not expect to become prime minister, joking: ‘I’d have a hell of a headache, wouldn’t I?’

But he added: ‘The first past the post system is brutal to parties like us and we have a lot of work to do in terms of building support in our stronger areas. But who’s to say?

‘In 2015, UKIP may well be needed in a coalition.’

Mr Cameron infuriated UKIP in 2006 by describing the party as a ‘bunch of fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists, mostly’.
