The Canadian man who sold military secrets to Russia apologized to his country and some of his family in a court sentencing hearing Friday.

But he didn’t apologize to his wife.

Sorry spy: Former Canadian navy sub-Lieutenant Jeffrey Paul Delisle sold Canadian government secrets to the Russians and apologized to his children and parents in a sentencing hearing Jan. 31.

Former Canadian navy Sub-Lieutenant Jeffrey Paul Delisle apologized to his children and parents in Halifax haring where prosecutors asked for at least a 25 year sentence.

'I’m sorry for the hurt and the pain that I caused them,” he said. 'It’s the same for my friends and colleagues.'

However, he’s not sorry to his wife. According to CTV, it was her infidelity that Delisle blamed for the emotional distress that led to his committing ‘professional suicide.’

Lawyer vs. lawyer: Delisle's defense lawyer Mike Tayler (left) urged the court to give a lighter sentence for crimes the defense says caused Canada little harm. Meanwhile, crown attorney Lyne Decarie pushed for at least twenty-five years in prison, saying Delisle caused 'exceptionally grave damage' to Canada

‘My wife, that I loved for so long, killed me,’ the 41-year-old said in an interrogation video that was played in the sentencing hearing.

‘And the pain of her betrayal and the pain she put my children through killed me.’

Spurned spy: In an interrogation video played in his sentencing hearing, Delisle said his wife's infidelity caused him to commit 'professional suicide' by selling Canadian government secrets to Russia

In 2007, Delisle entered a Russian Embassy in Ottowa and offered his services as a spy.

For the next five years, Delisle mined data available to him in his position in the Canadian navy.

At his disposal was sensitive information from Australia, U.K., New Sealand, and the U.S. as well as from Canada.

In fact, Canadian authorities neglected to uncover Delisle’s doings themselves. American officials had to first tip the country off.

Delisle received over $100,000 from Russian agents while working as a spy.

He copied data from government computers while working at the navy’s intelligence and communications center and then shared it with a Russian agent through a shared email account.

Prosecutors argued Delisle struck a damaging blow to Canada and its allies with his activities and a military official who testified agreed and said Delisle caused ‘exceptionally grave damage to Canada.

Meanwhile, Delisle’s defense refutes the claim and has asked for a lower sentence of around ten years in prison.

Russia’s ambassador to Canada, Georgiy Mamedov, seems to agree and said as much in an interview on CTV's Power Play.

Canuck cut-down: There's not 'too much to be spied out of Canada' Russian Ambassador to Canada said in a television interview

‘No disrespect, but I said it before – I don’t believe there’s too much to be spied out of Canada.'

Deslisle plead guilty to espionage back in October and will presumably learn the price he must pay when the hearing resumes February 8.
