Angry: Ex-gymnast Penny Brown, 51, had her ASR metal-on-metal implant removed in 2011. She said she has endured almost two years of constant pain

Almost 50,000 patients with ‘metal on metal’ hip replacements face increased checks amid fears they may cause serious health problems.

The UK’s safety watchdog has increased vigilance on implants suspected of causing serious damage to muscle and bone from metal debris.

Friction between two metal plates in the body produces chemical fragments called ions that leak into the blood, triggering inflammation and two to three times the predicted failure rate.

The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) yesterday issued a new alert to the NHS on a wide range of implants, saying there was a ‘small risk’ they could cause complications in patients.

Hip replacements involve a ball, socket and stem. The new alert relates to those whose replacements have a ball with a diameter of 36mm or more.

Around 65,000 people in the UK have received metal on metal hip implants since 2003, of whom 49,000 are affected by yesterday’s guidance because they have these ‘large-head’ implants. They have been told they should have annual tests on blood ion levels while those with symptoms will also need annual MRI scans.

Guidance published in 2010 said patients with large-head metal on metal implants should have annual checks for the first five years, but these have now been extended to the lifetime of the implant.

Doctors will be told to consider removing and replacing the implant if the MRI scans come back abnormal or they are concerned about rising ion levels in the blood.

Among those needing greater supervision are 10,000 people with DePuy ASR implants or resurfacing devices, which were recalled in 2010.

Some of those affected will need second hip replacements but excessive wear on the hip joint can make such surgery more difficult. The MHRA has received 370 ‘adverse incident’ reports involving metal on metal implants, including soft tissue damage, of which 242 relate to large-head implants.

Risk: Metal hip replacements by DePuy have already been recalled by hospitals for tests

Metal hips: Concerns are growing that small particles of metal in these devices could poison patients

According to the MHRA, metal on metal implants are made by the following manufacturers: Biomet, Smith & Nephew, Finsbury, Stryker, Zimmer, DePuy, Corin, Joint Replacement Instrumentation Ltd, Implacast GmbH and Wright Medical UK Ltd.

Solicitors are coordinating a group claim for ‘crippling pain’ and serious damage against DePuy Orthopaedics.

They claimed the MHRA action was ‘too late’ after figures showed metal on metal implants fail sooner than other devices such as those made of ceramic – with one in eight needing to be refitted within seven years and women being particularly badly affected.

Peter Walsh, chief executive of Action against Medical Accidents, said it was ‘scandalous that tens of thousands of patients have been put needlessly at risk by the failure by manufacturers and regulators to act quickly’.

Traditional
hip replacements – carried out since the 1950s – used a metal ball and a
plastic socket. In the 1990s, however, metal on metal types became 
popular.

In these 
products both the femoral ball, which sits on top of the leg, and the 
acetabular socket it fits into which is attached to the hip, are made of
metal. It was thought these could cope with more wear and tear.

Around 40,000 have them and they are still being fitted.

In
2010, regulators became worried about the number of patients needing 
their operations redone because their muscle tissue had been damaged by 
the metal on metal hips.

It
turned out tiny metal particles were getting into the blood, poisoning 
it and leaving patients in pain and with lasting damage to tissue. If 
the problem is not identified early enough, further operations can be 
more difficult.

The
Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ordered two types 
of hip implant manufactured by DePuy to be taken off the market.

Surgeons
say their failure rate could be 50 per cent after just six years for 
full hip replacements, far higher than previously thought. Other metal 
on metal implants – of which the most popular is the DePuy Pinnacle – 
may also have higher than average failure rates, but there is not enough
evidence yet to be sure.

If
you have a DePuy ASR or ASR XL implant or do not know whether you do, 
you are advised to see your doctor and ask for a blood test to check the
metal level, even if you are not experiencing any pain.

If
you have another brand of metal on metal implant you are advised not to
panic, but to have an annual check-up for five years. There is a 
website for ASR patients at asrrecall.depuy.com. DePuy has a helpline on 0800 2794865.

The
MHRA has issued a new alert for everyone with a metal on metal 
implant  because surgeons fear the devices are more dangerous than had 
been appreciated. It says most patients should have regular MRI scans to monitor the hip. It can be viewed at mhra.gov.uk

Dr Susanne Ludgate, the MHRA’s clinical director of devices, said problems surfaced in 2008 after reports from some surgeons that patients were suffering swelling around their hip.

She said the two-year delay before advice was issued on DePuy implants was because of ‘very varied reports from surgeons’ but they had performed worse than others.

A study by the British Medical Journal in 
partnership with the BBC, also revealed that some companies changed the 
design of the metal hips - making the head of the joint larger - without
performing safety trials first.

Tens of thousands of UK patients may 
have been exposed to dangerously high levels of toxic metals from 
failing hip implants, according to the investigation published in the BMJ.

This is despite the risks being known for decades.

Hip implants, like breast implants did not have to pass any clinical trials before they were put into patients.

However,
the report reveals that cobalt and chromium ions can seep into the 
tissues of patients with 'metal on metal' hip implants, causing local 
reactions that destroy muscle and bone, and leaving some patients with 
long term disability.

The BMJ said despite concerns being raised, UK and U.S regulators failed to warn doctors and patients of the potential dangers.

They
said evidence was mounting about high metal concentrations in patients 
with articular surface replacement (ASR) hips as early as 2006. But it 
was another four years until the UK regulator, the MHRA, issued an 
official safety alert and the ASR hip was recalled from the market.

Instead, it said the MHRA appointed a 
committee that included company representatives and several consultants 
to decide the fate of metal on metal hips.

As a result, the regulator concluded patients should be told about the risks, but no alert was issued to surgeons or patients.

During
this time, implant rates peaked. In England and Wales over 20,000 large
diameter metal on metal hips were implanted thereafter, while in the 
US, metal on metal hips are still being marketed to orthopaedic 
surgeons.

Nick Freemantle, Professor 
of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics at University College London 
says: 'We shouldn’t be in this position where we don’t know and there’s 
so much uncertainty. The stability of a compound should have been 
ascertained before it was used widely in people. As yet, we don’t know 
the consequences of this.'

Dr
Fiona Godlee, BMJ Editor in Chief says: 'Hip replacements are one of 
the great successes of modern medicine. But a combination of inadequate 
regulation and untrammelled commercialism has caused actual and 
potential harm for large numbers of patients around the world.

'They should have known about the risks, as the manufacturers and regulators did, but they were not told.

'No
pre-market system can ensure all devices are safe, but they can 
certainly make it more likely,' add Dr Carl Heneghan and colleagues in 
an accompanying article.

'Creating
an independent system for post-marketing analysis for implantable 
medical devices that is robust and increasing international coordination
around device alerts and withdrawals should go some way to sorting out 
the current mess.'
