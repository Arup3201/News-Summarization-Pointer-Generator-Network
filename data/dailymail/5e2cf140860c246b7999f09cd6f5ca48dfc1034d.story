A Michigan elected who was censored after using the word 'vagina' in an abortion debate performed controversial play Vagina Monologues on the steps of the state Capitol in Lansing last night.

Lisa Brown and ten other female 
legislators read the play where the word is featured over 100 times alongside the play's author, Eve Ensler in front of an estimated 2,500 people.

What started as a personal protest against Ms Brown's one-day gagging order turned into a rally for women's rights and freedom of speech.

Brown was silenced during a heated debate of a proposed bill restricting abortions. She said: 'Mr. Speaker, I’m flattered that you’re all so interested in my vagina, but "no" means "no."'

The crowd gathered was estimated to have reached 2,500 - 3,000 people before the performance started, many wore pink and carried signs with various slogans

She was banned from speaking on an unrelated bill on Thursday for 'violating the decorum of the House'.

The headcount for the reading was 2,500-attended 
the reading which turned into a mass rally with attendees sporting 
signs saying: ‘Get your mitts of my bitts [sic]’ and ‘Can’t say it? 
Don’t legislate it!’

The crowd chanted 'Vagina! Vagina! Vagina!' before Ms Brown came on stage with the other performers.

'Vagina is not a dirty word,' Brown, 45, told ABC News prior to the performance, before adding that it was about 'empowering' people to recognise that.

Lisa Brown and #sayvagina was trending on Twitter over the weekend and the issue is still hotly debated on social networks with the event already being referred to as 'Vaginagate'.

Author: The author of 'The Vagina Monologues' Eve Ensler in front of the crowd before she entered the stage. Ensler called the ban on Lisa Brown 'oppressive'

Last night's protest involved eleven 
lawmakers as well as Ms Ensler and local actors performing The Vagina 
Monologues, a controversial piece which features women talking about 
their own genitalia.

The playwright said in a press 
release: 'Censoring a woman for saying a word that is a body part that 
51 per cent of their constituents have is a repression that we have not 
and should not ever witness in this country.'

Ms Brown, a fierce opponent of 
Michigan's proposed anti-abortion bill, said: 'They banned me from 
speaking because I dared say vagina, the correct, medical name of a part
 of a woman's anatomy these lawmakers are trying to regulate.

Democratic Rep. Barb Byrum, was also barred from speaking last Thursday because she referred to vasectomies during the debate.

She told the crowd she was 'overwhelmed by the worldwide attention.

Before the play began, Ensler joined Brown and Byrum on the Capitol steps and called for an apology from the Republicans who barred them from speaking.

'These women stood for our rights,' Ensler said to applause.

'The vaginas are out. We are here to stay.'

During a heated debate on Wednesday 
Ms Brown, who is Jewish, spoke against a proposed bill which would 
further regulate abortions.

Banned: Lisa Brown, D-West Bloomfield, was told that she was not allowed participate in Thursday's debate on an unrelated bill because of her comments on during Wednesday's abortion debate

‘Wherever there’s a question of the 
life of the mother, or that of the unborn child, Jewish law rules in 
favour of preserving the life of the mother,' she said.

'The status of the fetus as human life does not equal that of the mother. I have not asked you to adapt and adhere to my religious beliefs. Why are you asking me to adapt to yours?’

But
 what caused the most controversy were the closing words to Brown’s 
speech. ‘And finally, Mr Speaker,’ she said. ‘I'm flattered that you're 
all so interested in my vagina, but no means no.’

Some representatives applauded her impassioned statement but others did not take too kindly to her bold words.

'What she said was offensive,' state Rep. Mike Callton, R-Nashville, told the Detroit News. 'It was so offensive, I don't even want to say it in front of women. I would not say that in mixed company,' he said.

State Rep. Lisa Lyons, R-Alto, agreed. 
'As a woman and mother, I was personally offended by Rep. Lisa Brown's 
disgraceful actions during Wednesday's floor debate, she said.

Majority Floor Leader Jim Stamas, 
R-Midland, said the decision to bar Brown from speaking was not her 
reference to the female anatomy, but her conduct.

'My concern was the decorum of the House, not of anything she said,' Stamas told the newspaper. 'I ask all members to maintain a decorum of the House, and I felt it went too far yesterday.'

But
 Ms Brown defended her decision to use the 'v-word'. 'If I can't say the
 word vagina, why are we legislating vaginas?' Brown said during a 
Capitol press conference. 'What language should I use? We're all adults 
here.'

During the same 
debate, Democratic representative Barb Byrum tried to introduce an 
amendment that would regulate vasectomies but was not allowed to speak. 
She protested and was declared 'out of order'.

'There
 were actions by Representative Byrum on the floor involving shouting in
 the chamber that also failed to maintain decorum,' House Speaker 
spokesman Ari Adler told CBS.

But
 Ms Byrum disagreed. 'It's my impression that I'm being banned from 
speaking as a result of my use of the term vasectomy - a medical 
procedure,' she told the Huffington Post.

'Neither
 of us has been contacted by Republican leadership as to why or how long
 we've been banned. Talk about disrespectful, that they don’t have the 
common decency to tell us themselves.'
