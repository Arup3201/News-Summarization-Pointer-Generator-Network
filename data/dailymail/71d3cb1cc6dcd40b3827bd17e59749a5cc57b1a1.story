A man has been arrested for breaking into an Illinois home and raping a four-year-old girl.

Police say they found Demetrio Campbell, 27, smoking a cigarette in a closet of the Calumet Park home after kicking down the front door and assaulting the girl.

Campbell allegedly tried to lure the girl and her seven-year-old sister as they played outside the home on Sunday, but they ran inside and locked the door.

According to the Chicago Tribune, the convicted felon began banging on the door demanding to be let in. He eventually kicked in the door and entered the home.

Police allege that Campbell ordered two older people in the house out of a bedroom and took the four-year-old girl inside, where he raped her.

One of the witnesses who was ordered out of the bedroom called the police.

When officers arrived, they found Campbell in the closet, smoking.

Judge Edward Bowden ordered Campbell, who is charged with predatory criminal sexual assault and home invasion, held without bond Wednesday at the Markham courthouse.

The judge also ordered Campbell to undergo psychiatric evaluation.

The Sun-Times reports that Campbell was taken away from his mother at the age of eight and has been in and out of foster homes.

The man suffers from 'mental problems,' Campbell's grandfather Charles Campbell said.

'His mind is not too good... He just talks crazy,' Charles Campbell told the Sun-Times.

Campbell was previously sentenced to six years prison for aggravated robbery in 2004 and four years prison in 2008 for burglary.

His next court date is April 28.
