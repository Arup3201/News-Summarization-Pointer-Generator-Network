These days it would probably be played on an Xbox, with Winnie the Pooh and Christopher Robin competing at the controls as they sit glued to a TV screen.

Back in the real world, it inspired one of the simplest and most enchanting games for generations of children growing up without the aid of technology.

Now the original drawing for A.A. Milne’s depiction of his most celebrated characters playing Poohsticks has emerged after 85 years.

This lost sketch that is the first ever depiction of the game Poohsticks by famed illustrator E.H Shepard has been found after 87 years

It shows Pooh Bear, Christopher Robin and Piglet gazing over a wooden bridge after dropping sticks into a river, waiting for them to float into sight on the other side.

The preliminary drawing which artist E.H. Shepard used to create the illustration in 1928 was thought to have been lost after he tore it from his sketchbook.

In fact it had been kept by Shepard’s 
wife Norah and given to a friend.

Next month the 9in by 5in sketch is 
expected to fetch more than £50,000 when Sotheby’s auctions it with 
another of Shepard’s A.A. Milne illustrations.

The game originates in chapter six of The House At Pooh Corner.

The real-life inspiration for the book’s setting – a forest that boasted a Heffalump trap and an area marked ‘Nice for Piknicks’ – is said to have been Posingford Bridge in Ashdown Forest, East Sussex, where Milne and his son Christopher played.

In tribute to the author, it has since been renamed Poohsticks Bridge.

Sotheby’s specialist Dr Philip 
Errington said the pencil drawing was the first version of ‘one of the 
most famous illustrations in children’s literature’.

The
drawing will be auctioned on December 10 along with another early 
illustration, showing Piglet staring in  wonder at Christopher Robin 
struggling with his braces.
