Celebrities taking part in the closing ceremony of the London Olympics got ‘sozzled’ after alcohol was smuggled backstage in contravention of a ‘booze ban’, it is claimed today.

Among the stars to have a drink after their performances were actor Timothy Spall and Queen guitarist Brian May.

In today’s Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, Guy Garvey, lead singer of the band Elbow, tells how the group brought crates of drinks and ‘loads’ of spirits into the Olympic stadium.

Garvey says: ‘It (the closing ceremony) was amazing. 

'We were told that it was a dry backstage until 10 o’clock. No booze. 

'I got really stroppy, which is not like me, so I ended up smuggling in a case of Guinness, a case of lager and a load of spirits.’

He claims the band hid the alcohol in suitcases used by the band Madness, who also took part in the three-hour show.

Garvey, 40, adds: ‘Word got round that Elbow had the booze and we had the great and the good from British (music) knocking on our door. Brian May knocked for a beer.’

But the frontman said the highlight was sharing a drink with Spall, who shot to fame in the Eighties TV drama Auf Wiedersehen, Pet. 

He said: ‘Me and Tim now are good buddies.’

Desert Island Discs is on at 11.15am, and on Friday at 9am.
