Historian Monika Siedentopf believes that Nazi spy chief Herbert Wichmann, pictured, wanted the German invasion to fail

Germany sent 12 Nazi spies to Britain in September 1940 to gather information ahead of Hitler's planned invasion.

But most of the agents who arrived as part of Operation Lena were arrested without having come close to completing their mission 'because of their own stupidity', according to official records.

One was arrested when he tried to order cider at 10am - not knowing that he could not be served before lunchtime during the war - while another two were spotted cycling on the wrong side of the road.

Their cover was blown when police officers discovered Nivea hand cream and German sausages in their bags.

The reason why Germany, known for meticulously-prepared spies, sent such incompetent agents on one of the most important missions of the second world war has remained a mystery.

Now historian Monika Siedentopf suggests that the botched mission, part of Operation Sealion - the code name given to Germany's plan to invade - was not a sign of German ineptness but an act of sabotage by anti-Hitler officials.

In her book Operation Sealion: Resistance inside the Secret Service, published this summer, Siedentopf traces the mission to a circle of people around Herbert Wichmann, the officer in charge of the Hamburg intelligence unit - one of Nazi Germany's top secret service posts.

Wichmann had close ties to spy chief Wilhelm Canaris and to the Stauffenberg group which planned to assassinate Hitler in July 1944.

MI5 described Wichmann and his group as 'good Germans, but bad Nazis'.

Siedentopf told the Guardian that she believes the spy chief had
 deliberately sent the agents - many of whom were not fluent in English -
 because he feared that Operation Sealion was badly planned and that it 
could cost German lives and resources.

He also feared that an attack on England would lead to a full world war.

To avoid the devastation Wichmann sent citizens with low levels of intelligence and a resounding enthusiasm for National Socialism.

Many of them were petty criminals and members of far-right organisations in the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark.
