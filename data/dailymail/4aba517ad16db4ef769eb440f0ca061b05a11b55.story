When it comes to buying a winter coat, British customers may have had the wool pulled over their eyes.

New research has found that UK consumers could pay up to 60 per cent more for their coats this year compared with other European shoppers.

International brands Zara and Mango, which were both founded in Spain, are among those accused of charging more in Britain than in countries such as Germany, Ireland and Spain.

Retailers claim that higher taxes and rents make it more expensive to do business in the UK, pushing up prices, while Britain’s stronger economy means we have more money to spend. But experts claimed that brands have been cashing in on customers’ willingness to pay ‘a premium’ for popular labels.

Zara’s profile has been boosted in recent years in the UK after its clothes were worn by well-known figures including the Duchess of Cambridge and Samantha Cameron.

Foreign currency firm Caxton FX found a Zara draped wool coat costs 60 per cent more here than in Spain.

Zara is among the stores which are charging Brits more for clothes than they do in the EU

A khaki duffle coat with a fur hood was 37 per cent cheaper in Spain and cost 22 per cent less in Ireland. A red leather handbag from Zara was 22 per cent cheaper in Europe, while flat leather zip-up boots were 33 per cent cheaper. Mango’s winter coats were also more expensive in the UK, with a faux fur coat costing 46 per cent more.

Asda has launched a range of clothing for women who are dress sizes 18 to 32.

The George Plus range was created after customers complained they struggled to find affordable, fashion-able clothes in larger sizes.

The supermarket said its prices, which start from £8 for a pair of leggings or a top, are up to 65 per cent cheaper than its nearest rivals.

A spokesman said: ‘All women have the right to feel beautiful in the clothes they wear without the fear of being judged.’

However, health campaigners criticised the store, saying that it had a ‘responsibility’ to help tackle rising obesity rates. 

Neil Saunders, managing director of retail research agency Conlumino, said: ‘Retailers obviously want to charge as much as they can. In stronger economies, retailers can charge higher prices. That said, with the rise of online this has become more difficult because international prices are more visible.’

Mr Saunders went on to say that ‘the willingness of the UK consumer to spend on fashion’ and the strength of the pound against the euro were partly to blame for steeper price tags.

But he added: ‘One of the issues with flexing pricing across different countries is that consumers are now more likely to pick up on this and differences that are too great can be damaging to the brand as shoppers feel like they are being ripped off.’

A Zara spokesman said: ‘Zara’s prices are set by individual markets to keep the same commercial positioning in terms of fashionable quality products at affordable prices.

‘These price-points take into account competitive local pricing, but also regional operating costs, such as rent and salaries.’

A spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said: ‘With a free- market economy, retailers rightly decide the market worth of their products and then price them accordingly.’

However James Hickman, managing director of Caxton FX – a specialist payment provider for foreign currency – said: ‘With the public increasingly aware of the great offers available online, they are now taking advantage of overseas bargains from the comfort of their own home.’
