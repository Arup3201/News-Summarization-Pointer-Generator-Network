David Cameron showed how being Prime Minister is like child’s play today, as he strolled along Whitehall carrying a doll.

The Premier was spotted with the toy as he tried to catch up with his daughter Florence while she scooted through central London.

Mr Cameron took the three-year-old to nursery in Westminster before rushing back to Number 10 to chair Cabinet.

Toy story: David Cameron was out early this morning carrying a doll in Whitehall as he took daughter Florence to nursery

Downing Street insiders had promised the New Year would see a major push by the Tories to seize the political initiative.

Mr Cameron used an interview on Sunday to insist he was ‘trying to help hardworking people’ as he promised to protect increases in the state pension and curb benefits being sent across the EU.

Yesterday Chancellor George Osborne used a major speech to warn of ‘tough choices’ in the year ahead.

But the flurry of activity appeared to grind to a halt today, with the major announcement from Mr Cameron’s ministers being Environment Secretary Owen Paterson telling people to eat more British fruit and vegetables.

One of the biggest political stories of the day has been the news that the Premier’s hairdresser received a gong in the New Year’s Honour’s list.

Lino Carbosiero, a hairdresser to the stars, has been given an MBE.

Mr Cameron has insisted on taking his children to school or nursery as often as possible.

But office workers rushing through central London will have been surprised to see then man in charge of the country clutching a doll as he crossed the road.

He was seen helping Florence with her scooter before she sped ahead.

The Camerons have fiercely protected their child’s privacy since entering Number 10, but Florence was seen smiling on the couple’s official Christmas card last month.

After dropping Florence at her nursery, Mr Cameron returned to Downing Street to chair Cabinet.

He updated ministers on his pre-Christmas trip to Afghanistan, telling them ‘there is significant progress being made in the strength and resilience of the Afghan national security forces” and that “the UK’s drawdown of combat troops is absolutely on track’.

There was also discussion of the demand from Mr Osborne to find an extra £12billion in welfare spending over two years to 2017-18.
