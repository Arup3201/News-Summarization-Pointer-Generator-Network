Tiny swimming trunks are known as 'budgie smugglers,' but the term might have new meaning after customs officials at Sydney's airport said they found 16 wild-bird eggs in the crotch of a passenger's pants.

The 39-year-old Czech man arrived Tuesday on a flight from Dubai when customs officials selected him for a baggage examination, Australian Customs and Border Protection Service said in a statement.

'Officers conducted a frisk search of the man and allegedly found 16 small eggs concealed in his groin area,' the statement said.

Small bird eggs were found hidden in a strip of fabric in the pants of a traveller arriving at Sydney Airport on Tuesday

There was no word on whether it was budgies - small parrots also known as budgerigars - that were allegedly smuggled. The species has yet to be identified.

The man, whose name has not been released, was to appear in a Sydney court on Wednesday charged under environmental protection laws with attempting to import regulated live specimens without a permit.

The charge carries maximum penalties of 10 years in prison and a fine of $170,000 Austra($157,000USD).

The Czech man was stopped by officials for a bag inspection at Sydney International Airport

The eggs were weighed by Border Protection, and there is no word yet on what species they are from
