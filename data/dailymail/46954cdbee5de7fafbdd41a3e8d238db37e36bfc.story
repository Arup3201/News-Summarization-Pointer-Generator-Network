Just three British authors appear on the shortlist for this year's Man Booker Prize after a change to the literary award opened the door for international writers for the first time.

Past Booker winner Howard Jacobson and Ali Smith, who has twice made the shortlist, join Calcutta-born and London-based author Neel Mukherjee in representing British talent.

For the first time, the six-strong shortlist includes authors from the U.S. after a rule change opened the award up to writers from any nationality writing in English who had their book published in the UK.

Previous winner: British author Howard Jacobson, left, took home the prize in 2010 for his comic novel The Finkler Question. This year he will hope to win with his futuristic love story J, pictured right

Previously the competition, which recognises the year's best fiction, was open to entrants from the Commonwealth, Republic of Ireland and Zimbabwe.

The announcement last year that the Booker was dropping its geographical
 borders came in the wake of the launch of the Folio Prize - seen by 
many as a rival award - which attracted an international field.

Two American writers - Joshua Ferris and Karen Joy Fowler - and Australian author Richard Flanagan make up the rest of the shortlist, which the judges took three hours and 40 minutes to whittle down the shortlist from the longlist of 13.

The winner of the prize, which will be announced on 14 October, will take home £50,000.

Judges said the strong British presence 
on the shortlist was not the result of tokenism and that fears that the 
prize would be 'flooded by quality American novels to the detriment of 
everything else' following the change in rules had been unfounded.

Howard Jacobson, who won the prize in 2010, is nominated for his futuristic love story J. It features two main characters who inhabit a world where the past is not spoken about and is shrouded in suspicion, referred to as 'What Happened, If It Happened'.

Shortlist veteran: Scottish-born novelist Ali Smith is nominated for How To Be Both. She was nominated in 2001 for her novel Accidental in 2005 and Hotel World, published in 2001

Judges described Jacobson's novel, set in a Britain which has been 'changed 
utterly' following 'some kind of national tragedy' as 'very funny, very 
troubling and very surprising'.

They added that the novel says things that remain unspoken 'except in perhaps the darkest recesses of the internet'.

This is the 46th year that the Booker Prize has been awarded - and is the first time that the judges have considered entries from international authors.

Previously, the competition was open to entrants from the Commonwealth, Republic of Ireland and Zimbabwe.

PH Newby was the first winner of the prize in 1969 with Something to Answer For, while Yann Martel was the first winner of the Man Booker Prize with Life of Pi in 2002 - after Man Group plc came on board as sponsor.

The Booker Prize initially awarded £5,000 to its winners. The prize 
money doubled in 1978 to £10,000, and today the winner receives £50,000.
 Each of the shortlisted authors receives £2,500.

Since 1969, 30 men and 16 women have won the prize.

Hilary Mantel is the first woman and the first British author to win the
 prize twice. JM Coetzee was the first person to win twice, in 1983 and 
again in 1999, when he described the Booker as ‘the ultimate prize to 
win in the English speaking world’. 

Mantel is also the first and only author to win for two books in a triology - Wolf Hall and Bringing Up The Bodies.Last year's winner, The Luminaries by Eleanor Catton, was the longest in the prize's history at 832 pages.

Scottish-born Smith was one of only three women on the 13-strong longlist for her inventive new novel, How To Be Both.

The
 book tells two interlinking stories, one about a renaissance artist in 
15th Century Italy, the other about a child of the 1960s - and the 
reader can decide which half to read first.

Judges hailed the novel as a 'genre-bending' tale about art and its versatility.

The two British authors have been named joint-favourite to win by bookmaker William Hill.

Calcutta-born author Mukherjee, who is now based in London, draws on his background in his novel The Lives of Others, which begins in the city in 1967.

Judges described Mukherjee's
 book as a 'sweeping epic' about a wealthy family in decline in Calcutta
 set against a 'tumultuous' backdrop.

Joshua Ferris's 
third novel, To Rise Again at a Decent Hour, looks at atheism through 
the eyes of a dentist, who spends the day looking at death and decay but
 cannot find solace in religion.

Fellow author Stephen King called it 'funny, thought-provoking and touching'.

Australia's Richard
 Flanagan is nominated for The Narrow Road to the Deep
 North, a haunting account of the Australian servicemen who, as Japanese
 prisoners of war, were forced to build the so-called Burma railway.

The
 author, from Tasmania, wrote the book in tribute to his late father who
 survived the experience - but thousands more did not.

Karen Joy Fowler is best known for her light-hearted novel The Jane Austen Book 
Club.

She is nominated for We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves. In this latest work, love is again the theme, this time entwined with the family and the notion of such 'stranger' intrusion.

Omissions from the shortlist include popular writers David Nicholls and 
David Mitchell, both of whom had been included on the longlist which was
 unveiled in July.

British author: Calcutta-born author Mukherjee, draws on his background in his novel The Lives of Others, which tells the story of the lives of two Bengali families. The author is now based in London

Writer and 
philosopher AC Grayling, chair of this year's judges, said: ‘We are 
delighted to announce our international shortlist.

'As the Man Booker 
Prize expands its borders, these six exceptional books take the reader 
on journeys around the world, between the UK, New York, Thailand, Italy,
 Calcutta and times past, present and future.

'We
 had a lengthy and intensive debate to whittle the list down to these 
six.  It is a strong, thought-provoking shortlist which we believe 
demonstrates the wonderful depth and range of contemporary fiction in 
English.’

Hollywood credentials: Australia's Richard Flanagan, who co-wrote the script for Baz Luhrmann's Australia, is nominated for The Narrow Road to the Deep North

He
 said that it was a 'very, very rich year' for literature which 'makes 
the task of judging very, very difficult'. He added 'That's just how the
 cards fell.'

He said that the fiction genre was 'flourishing' despite competition from other media.

Judge
 Sarah Churchwell said that, while historical fiction had dominated 
previous shortlists, 'fiction about the contemporary moment and the 
recent past is making a resurgence'.

American dream: Karen Joy Fowler, who is best known for her light-hearted novel The Jane Austen Book Club, is nominated for We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves

She said: 'We had plenty of historical novels but these are all very contemporary novels. The contemporary is coming into its own and finding its teeth again.'

She said that some of the novels on the shortlist asked new questions about what it is like to live in a digital world.

Grayling and the judging panel of Jonathan Bate, Sarah Churchwell, 
Daniel Glaser, Alastair Niven and Erica Wagner will now re-read the 
titles to select a winner who will be announced at a ceremony to be 
staged at the Guildhall in London on October 14.

New rules: Joshua Ferris's third novel, To Rise Again at a Decent Hour, looks at atheism through the eyes of a dentist. He is one of two American authors on the six-strong shortlist

Ali Smith (UK), How To Be Both

How to be Both is a novel all about art's versatility.  Borrowing from painting's fresco technique to make an original literary double-take, it's a fast-moving genre-bending conversation between forms, times, truths and fictions. 

There's a renaissance artist of the 1460s.  There's the child of a child of the 1960s.  Two tales of love and injustice twist into a singular yarn where time gets timeless, structural gets playful, knowing gets mysterious, fictional gets real - and all life's givens get given a second chance.

This is the third time that Scottish-born Smith has made the shortlist. She was previously acknowledged for her second novel Hotel World, published in 2001, and 2005 entry The Accidental.

Howard Jacobson (UK), J

Set in the future, a world where the past is a dangerous country, not to be talked about or visited, J is a love story of incomparable strangeness, both tender and terrifying.

Hanging over the lives of all the characters in this novel is a momentous catastrophe – a past event shrouded in suspicion, denial and apology, now referred to as What Happened, If It Happened.

Jacobson won in 2010 for his comic novel The Finkler Question, beating contenders including double winner Peter Carey.

Neel Mukherjee (UK), The Lives of Others

Calcutta-born author Mukherjee,
 now based in London, draws on his background in his novel The Lives of Others, which begins 
in the city in 1967.

Judges described Mukherjee's
 book as a 'sweeping epic' about a wealthy family in decline in Calcutta
 set against a 'tumultuous' backdrop.

Joshua Ferris (US), To Rise Again at a Decent Hour

Joshua Ferris's third novel, To Rise Again at a 
Decent Hour, looks at atheism through the eyes of a dentist, who spends 
the day looking at death and decay but cannot find solace in religion.

Author Stephen King called it 'Funny, thought-provoking and touching'.

Richard Flanagan (Australia), The Narrow Road to the Deep North

Richard Flanagan, considered by many to be one of the finest Australian novelists of his generation, offers a haunting account of the Australian 
servicemen who, as Japanese prisoners of war, were forced to build the 
so-called Burma railway.

He wrote the book as a tribute to his father who survived the harrowing experience - when thousands of others did not.

Karen Joy Fowler (US), We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves

Karen Joy Fowler, best known for her 
light-hearted novel The Jane Austen Book Club, is nominated for We Are 
All Completely Beside Ourselves, about an ordinary Mid-western family: 
two parents and three children - one of whom turns out to be 
surprisingly special.
