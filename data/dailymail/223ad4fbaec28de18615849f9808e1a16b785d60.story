UEFA has punished Galatasaray and Borussia Dortmund for crowd disorder and sanctioned BATE Borisov for racism by its fans at Champions League matches.

UEFA says its disciplinary panel fined Galatasaray €70,000 (£56,000) for disturbances which stopped play twice during a 4-1 loss at Dortmund this month. 

The Turkish club's fans ran onto the pitch and threw lit fireworks.

UEFA ordered Galatasaray to pay Dortmund for damage repairs. It issued the same sanction after Galatasaray's group match at Arsenal.

The German club was fined €32,000 (£25,600) for its fans' part in the disorder.

UEFA also ordered BATE Borisov to close a section of its stadium when it hosts Porto next week.

BATE fans were found guilty of racist behaviour during a 7-0 loss against visiting Shakhtar Donetsk last month.
