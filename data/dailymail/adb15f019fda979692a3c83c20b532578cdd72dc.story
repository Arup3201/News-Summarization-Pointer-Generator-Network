Cristiano Ronaldo will demand a ground-breaking £500,000-a-week to join either Chelsea or Manchester United next summer.

Real Madrid star Ronaldo last week confirmed a story Football Grapevine broke 18 months ago that he was on the verge of re-joining United in the summer of 2013.

That deal was scuppered by the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson and the fact that United were not prepared to pay Ronaldo what he wanted and eventually got on a new deal with Real Madrid which is in the region of £350,000-a-week.

Cristiano Ronaldo will demand £500,000-a-week to join either Chelsea or Manchester United next summer

Since then, United have given Wayne Rooney a £300,000-a-week contract and last week signed Ramadal Falcao on a deal which will earn the Colombian £280,000-a-week.

Falcao’s deal was sealed by super-agent Jorge Mendes, who is also Ronaldo’s agent.

That United's American owners the Glazers have been prepared to loosen the purse strings to such an extent has encouraged Ronaldo to consider a return back to the Barclays Premier League.

Indeed, Ronaldo last week hinted that he could leave Real Madrid next summer. And he would be ready to move back to Old Trafford which was on the brink of happening in summer 2013 but the deal collapsed over the players wage demands.

The new policy at United has now changed the financial dynamic.

But, given the links Mendes has with Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho and owner Roman Abramovich, Ronaldo could also be tempted to a move to the west London club.

I am hearing

Slaven Bilic, still boss of Turkish club Besiktas, has re-emerged as a potential successor to Sam Allardyce at West Ham even though he turned down David Sullivan before former manager Avram Grant (remember him) was given the job after Gianfranco Zola was sacked.

I am also hearing

West Ham are set to offer 18-year-old starlet Reece Burke, who is nowhere near the first team, a £4,000-a-week contract to fend off interest from Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal.

Back Heel

Its been a tough start for Louis van Gaal at Manchester United but nothing can really compare to Brian Clough’s brief turbulent reign at Leeds.

Its 40 years ago this week that Clough was sacked by Leeds after just six games, seven weeks, or more famously 44 days.

A combination of his maverick managerial style and a set of Leeds players who resented the fact that father-figure Don Revie, who had been appointed England manager, had been replaced by Clough and by not veteran start Johnny Giles.

To compound the situation Clough, who died ten years ago this week, did not disguise his loathing for the Leeds approach to the game or indeed Revie himself.

Amazingly on the evening of his dismissal a Yorkshire TV chat shot managed to get both Clough and Revie in the studio.

In a an era before PR spin doctors and candyfloss presenters Clough and Revie locked antlers and the outcome to was an amazing spat between the two men.

It was TV in the raw of the like you will never see on Sky today.

Libero

Gareth Bale said the 3G artificial pitch he played on for Wales in Andorra was the worst surface he’s ever played on in a proper game.

Pitches of the top level teams are now a subtle blend between turf and synthetics which makes for reliable bowling green surfaces that are evergreen, relatively forgiving and don’t cut up.

How times change.

Gareth Bale said the   pitch he played on in Andorra was the worst surface he’s ever played professionally

Mon: Roy Hodgson should lose his cool and swear a bit more often. It seemed Hodgson has transferred some of his angst on to his players as England played with passion and purpose to win 2-0 against a strong Switzerland side in Basel.

Tue: Chris Coleman hailed Gareth Bale as Wales’ Messi, note not Ronaldo, and Bale lived up to the billing in Andorra.

Wed: Brendan Rodgers quite rightly slams the England medical team for not applying basic sense (as opposed to sport science) which sees Daniel Sturridge get injured during international training when clearly he needed a rest not more work.

Thurs: After their worst ever Premier League season Manchester United reveal they had a record revenue year - it would seem shirt sales in South America, Asia and so on add up to more than silverware.

Fri: Oscar Pistorius, cleared of murder, but guilty of manslaughter for the de facto killing his female partner gets bail. But Paul Gascoigne is in high dudgeon for another drunken rumpus, arrested and by many demonised. But for all his faults - and lets not forget how much joy Gazza gave the country - he never killed anyone. Yet he could serve more time than Pistorius.

Life’s a Pitch, and back in the day players had to play on all sorts of surfaces, in the winter months mainly mud or sometimes even snow.

One of the worst was Derby’s Baseball Ground.

Yes they still played some great football under Brian Clough then Dave Mackay in the Seventies.

It wasn’t all long ball back then by any stretch of the imagination as some would like to suggest now, but it’s fair to say that often because the conditions defenders would look for an early ball into channels because passing the ball across the back ran the risk of the ball getting stuck in the mud, intercepted and a goal being given away.

Yet at the same some there was a generation of midfielders in that era such as Graeme Souness, Liam Brady and Glenn Hoddle who imperiously glided through the mud with effortless ease during the Seventies and Eighties.

As Liverpool boss Bob Paisley used to say: 'Great players can play on broken glass.'

To be fair to Bale he is a great player and despite his moans he rose to the occasions in Andorra and saved Wales from humiliating defeat as they came from behind to win 2-1 with him scoring both goals.

BTW

Frank Lampard admitted the moment he knew he had to quit England was when Luke Shaw told him he didn’t know who Tony Adams was. Why is it not part of a scholarship at clubs that young players are told the history of the game?

Why has Sepp Blatter suddenly done a U-turn and argued for video replays? Maybe a man who was so against technology has recently reviewed the situation because of the commercial advantages.
