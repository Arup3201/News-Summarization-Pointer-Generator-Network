He may well be one of greatest physicists to have ever lived.

And now Professor Stephen Hawking is to make many people's dreams come true as he plays his part in the demise of the Go Compare advert singer.

The renowned scientist is the latest celebrity to star in the website's adverts, the most recent of which sees him sucking the opera singer into a black hole.

Hawking insurance: Steven Hawking appears in the latest Go Compare advert which sees him sucking the opera singer into a black hole

The former Lucasian professor of 
mathematics at Cambridge University joins the likes of television 
presenter Sue Barker and survival expert Ray Mears in plotting to 
destroy fictitious opera singer Gio Compario and silence his irritating 
sales slogan.

The 
advert, which will be shown for the first time today, sees 70-year-old 
Professor Hawking announce to a packed lecture theatre that he has discovered how 
to generate a super massive black hole, before being asked what he will 
do with the knowledge.

The 
scene then cuts to the opera singer - played by Wynne Evans - haranguing
a couple in the street, before a black hole forms behind him and sucks 
him in.

Fan: Professor Hawking said he was 'delighted to be given the opportunity to help save the nation and silence Gio'

The wheelchair-bound
scientist, well known for speaking using a computerised voice because 
of his motor neurone disease, is then shown laughing.

Professor
Hawking, now director of research at Cambridge's Centre for Theoretical
Cosmology, said: ‘I confess I am a fan of the Gocompare.com adverts, 
but I am also an opera fan, so I was delighted to be given the 
opportunity to help save the nation and silence Gio.

‘I hope the public find it as funny as I did.’

He joins a list of celebrities who have 
starred in the adverts this year which show people attempting to do away
with the moustachioed tenor.

Former footballer Stuart Pearce and camp dancer Louie Spence have also starred in versions of the advert.
