A mother, whose five-year-old daughter was mauled by a dog over the weekend, has been left furious after local authorities failed to respond to the emergency.

Alexis Douglas and her older sister were playing with a neighbour's pitbull cross in the front yard of a friend's house in Carrum Downs, Victoria, when the dog suddenly ' launched' at the five-year-old.

Monique Douglas told 3AW radio that her daughter was left with 'horrific' injuries to her face as a result of the attack on Friday night, which will see her needing years of plastic surgery. 

'The plastic surgeons took her to theatre and they've done a great job by the looks of it under the bandages, but her whole face is bandaged on the left side and she will need further treatment,' Mrs Douglas said.

She was left with horrific injuries that will require regular visits to plastic surgeons, according to her mother

'We have to go back to the hospital to see plastic surgeons on Thursday and then it's regular visits after that.

'I asked myself every day, 'why was it her? Why did this dog do it to her?'.

Her older daughter, who witnessed the entire attack, is also understood to have been traumatised by the incident, according to the Herald Sun. 

But aside from the countless hours and money she'll have to spend on medical procedures, Mrs Douglas revealed she was furious at her local council and services at their failure to respond to the attack over the long weekend.

She said she had contacted Frankston City Council, the Dangerous Dogs hotline and her local police immediately after the incident, but failed to receive a response until taking her plight to the media on Tuesday.

Ed Powell, the owner of the pit-bull, is understood to have handed his dog in to be put down since the traumatic event

Ed Powell, the owner of the pitbull, is understood to have handed his dog in to be put down since the traumatic event. 

He told Nine News that he was 'shattered' by the unexpected incident, saying that the animal had never been aggressive towards his children. .

'They were playing together for an hour, hour and a half, and then I don't know what happened, the dog, couldn't have expected it, just attacked her,' he said.
