A mother has shared her grief seven months after her pregnant daughter was mysteriously murdered in Hawaii and the baby's father vanished without a trace.

Brittany Jane Royal, 25, was newly pregnant when she was strangled with rope, dragged across rocks and thrown into the ocean off Kalpana, Hawaii.

Police initially suspected her missing boyfriend, Boza David Johnson, 22, but family members have insisted he had no money to escape or motive to kill her.

Months later, a local news site received a cryptic note suggesting Johnson, known to his friends and family as 'Bo', had also been killed amid racial tensions.

What happened? Brittany Royal, 25, was murdered in Hawaii in May and her boyfriend, Bo Johnson, 22, vanished and was suspected of killing her. But her family is not convinced he was responsible

Now the Royal and Johnson families have been left with little to go on and no further to finding out exactly what happened to their loved ones.

'Whoever killed her does not deserve to be walking around,' Royal's mother Julie told People magazine in a new interview.

'But I feel like I can't really grieve right now because of the not knowing. It's always there. It's always going to be there.'

Julie was initially worried about how
trusting her 'free spirited' daughter could be but knew it was right 
for Brittany when she decided to go traveling to the Big Island of 
Hawaii in January.

There, 
she met Johnson and just months later they returned to the family home 
in Tustin, California to break the news: they were expecting a baby.

They also announced their plans for the 
future; Brittany said she would work as a yoga instructor while Bo 
wanted give lava tours.

Tragedy: Brittany was newly pregnant and looking forward to starting a yoga business when she was killed

'She seemed finally ready to settle down,' Royal said.

But less than three weeks later, Bo failed to turn up to a meeting with a real estate agent and Brittany didn't call her mother to wish her a happy birthday.

Days later, on May 28, a fisherman found her body in waters off the island.

Unanswered questions: Brittany's family became concerned when she failed to call her mother on her birthday, and her partner missed an appointment with a real estate agent

Police
believe that Bo killed his girlfriend, Hawaii Police Department Lt. 
Gregory M. Esteban told People magazine, but added that his whereabouts 
since have not been known.

But Bo's sister Sarah told the magazine: 'He's not capable of this. He has a good heart. We were taught right from wrong.'

Then
to further complicate the case, a news site received the anonymous 
letter claiming that Bo had also been killed following racial tensions. 
The note listed specifics about the alleged murder.

Bizzare: Signs have started appearing around the town saying that Bo was murdered on the lava fields

The writer explains that Bo had intended to buy land at Kalapana and conduct lava tours without paying locals a cut of $1,000 a week.

'Haole had to be killed befor (sic) he buy land... said this message 2 haole, stay out of Puna - Puna is for the pono,' the note said.

In Hawaii, 'haole' is a term used for caucasians and 'pono' is a Hawaiian word for righteousness.

Posters also began to emerge around the town, reading: 'You killed the baby! They killed Bo on the lava flow! Confess!'

Ahead of his disappearance, Bo was supposed to meet with a realtor and was going to sign a deal to purchase 10 acres of land - but he never showed up.

Scene: Her body was found off the coast of Kalpana, Hawaii near to where the couple had been camping

Now his family doesn't know what to think.

'If he isn't the murderer, that means he's dead,' his sister said. 'So what do we have to look forward to. I keep praying that the police get their job done and they find this killer.'

Both of the families have said that the police have failed to keep them updated with the case, and for now, all they can do is wonder what happened to their loved ones and who is responsible.
