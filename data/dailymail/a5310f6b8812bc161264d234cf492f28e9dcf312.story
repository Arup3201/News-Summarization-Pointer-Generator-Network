Andrew Cole has jumped to the defence of Manchester United and rubbished suggestions that his former club are in terminal decline.

United have made a calamitous start to life under new manager Louis van Gaal, failing to win two Premier League games against Swansea and Sunderland before crashing to a 4-0 at MK Dons in the Capital One Cup.

Paul Scholes has admitted he is ‘scared’ for the club he served so well. Cole, however, is a little more optimistic and does not believe that United will stagnate in the same as Liverpool did following the Anfield club’s sustained dominance in English football in the 1980's.

Poor start: Louis van Gaal is under pressure after failing to win in his opening three Manchester United games 

Red alert: United were thrashed 4-0 by MK Dons in the second round of the Capital One Cup on Tuesday night

‘I understand where Paul Scholes is coming from with his comments but I don’t think we will do a Liverpool’ Cole said,’We won’t be like that.

‘You don’t want barren spells because the Premier League gets stronger. European football moves on again if you are not in it for a year. That is the way football is it doesn’t stand still for anybody. So problems have to be addressed quickly.’

Cole does, however, accept that urgent improvement is required: ‘If you don’t win something at a club of this magnitude then people start questioning the players the manager and everybody. That is to be expected. The history of this club is about winning.

Recovery: Andrew Cole, part of the famous treble-winning side, is hopeful United will make a recovery 

‘We have been so dominant so when you don’t win something then people say you are not the team you used to be.

‘I have seen comments recently, and it is heart wrenching, saying this is the worst United team in 20 years or whatever. Hello! Get a grip and stop talking about Manchester United in this way because United will be there or thereabouts.’

‘When you lose a successful manager after 25 years that is a big big thing. You bring a new manager in and it doesn’t work out so you change again. It is going to take time. Louis van Gaal has done it in Europe and has a great record we are hoping he can bring that to this club now.’

Andrew Cole was speaking at the launch of Manchester United and Apollo Tyre’s ‘Go The Distance’ pitch at Old Trafford.
