What do you give a boy born with a silver spoon in his mouth?

The answer, it seems, includes a possum fur cloak, a speedboat that doubles as a car, and a rather more traditional rocking horse.

Whether Prince George will have time to enjoy any of these things is another matter, however – because they were just three of nearly 800 official gifts he was showered with last year.

The impressive haul meant the 18-month-old received more presents than any other member of the Royal Family.

George also received a mini leather flying helmet from Lord Of The Rings film director Sir Peter Jackson, a baby BMX bike, a customised surfboard, a skateboard and a cuddly toy from President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle.

According to Kensington Palace, the future king received more than 250 games and toys on his inaugural royal tour to Australia and New Zealand last April, and more than 120 items of clothing.

There were also several dozen pieces of sporting equipment, well over 150 books and enough CDs and DVDs to keep him amused for a lifetime.

Details of the presents were published yesterday in the official list of gifts given to the Royals in 2014. The exact value of each item is not listed, so as not to offend the giver, and many are also so unique the price is virtually impossible to calculate.

The list of almost 2,000 items is not exhaustive, however, because Prince Charles’s private office and that of William, Kate and Harry at Kensington Palace only reveal gifts given on official foreign tours.

Unusual: The 30-year-old was given a decommissioned automatic rifle during November's trip to Oman

Charles and Camilla were the recipients of some of the more expensive presents, including two ceremonial swords from King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia. 

On the couple’s official tour to Colombia in the autumn, the Duchess of Cornwall was gifted a magnificent pair of gold and emerald earrings by the First Lady of Colombia, and a designer snakeskin handbag in Canada.

The Queen received an eclectic range of goods, from a boot scraper to a seven-inch miniature throne from the popular TV series Game of Thrones, given to her on a visit to Northern Ireland.

While his miniature boat and industrial quantities of toys might be the most eye-catching part of George's haul, they aren't the only ones. Here are the best of the rest:

Global giving: The Royal Family has received items from all over the world, some unusual

Prince William was given an Akubra Cattleman’s hat on the tour Down Under and several pairs of cufflinks. Kate received jewellery including a silver and opal brooch, as well as bags and outfits.

Princess Anne and Prince Andrew received some of the more original offerings. She received Princess Molly Minx Face Powder from an anonymous admirer in Thailand, while the Duke of York was given an Arctic Monkeys CD by schoolchildren.

A Kensington palace spokesman said: ‘The vast majority of the gifts are logged and archived. Some will be taken into royal residences, some displayed or stored and some, such as flowers or perishable items, are often donated to organisations that could make good use of them.’ 

Giving and receiving gifts is considered an important part of the Royal Family’s work in developing good relations with other countries

Modest items – including books, clothes and gadgets such as mobile phones and iPads – can be used by the Royals, displayed in a residence, loaned out to an organisation or stored. Food or flowers worth less than £150 can be used, or given to a local charity, hospital or hospice.

A high-value item, such as jewellery, is not considered to be personal property. Royals are, however, permitted to use it during their lifetime.
