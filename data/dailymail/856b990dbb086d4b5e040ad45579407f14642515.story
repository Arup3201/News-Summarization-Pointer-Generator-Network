Sir Chris Hoy has posted touching pictures of his baby son who was born 11 weeks premature on what would have been his due date.

The six-time Olympic champion became a dad for the first time when his wife Sarra, 33, gave birth to Callum David Robert Hoy at 29 weeks on October 15.

Earlier this month, the couple received an early Christmas present when they were allowed to take the tiny tot home.

The 38-year-old sportsman tweeted then and now shots on Twitter, adding: 'Today was Callum's due date, but he arrived 11 weeks early. Amazing how far he's come since then, we're so thankful.'

Last month, Sir Chris proudly tweeted his first picture of baby Callum in his hospital cot.

He wrote: 'Thanks for all your messages for Callum. He's doing well so far and says hi!' 

Mrs Hoy retweeted the photograph and told her followers: 'The messages of support we've received about Callum mean so much. 

'From the bottom of our hearts, thank you. They have really, truly helped.' 

Sir Chris had previously shared a picture just showing Callum's tiny hand clutching his finger and alongside it he wrote: 'Although v. early days for wee Callum, he's doing well as is Sarra. Huge thanks to incredible medical staff.'

And Sir Chris had also taken to Twitter to confirm the birth of his 'beautiful baby son' on October 15 and admitted he was 'a little shocked' with the early arrival who was born 11 weeks early.

He said: 'Amazed, delighted & a little shocked to announce the birth of our beautiful baby son, Callum David Robert Hoy! Born at 29weeks, today at 2pm.'

The sporting star previously spoke of his excitement about becoming a father for the first time.

He said: 'I think maybe I'm just blindly optimistic that it's going to be great fun and dead easy. 

'I'm sure it won't be, I'm sure there'll be lots of tough things but I'm just very excited. It all seems to have happened at the right time.'

Sir Chris married lawyer Sarra in 2010 and announced on Twitter that they were expecting their first child on June 25. 

Since retiring from cycling last year, the star has taken up motorsport with plans to compete at the 24-hour Le Mans race in 2016.
