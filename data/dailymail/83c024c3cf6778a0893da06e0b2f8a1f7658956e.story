She was a young woman who had her dreams of being a model ruined when she became the victim of an acid attack instigated by her ex-boyfriend in 2008. 

And on Friday, Katie Piper proved she's stronger than ever by launching the UK's first-ever fashion catwalk that  included models with visible differences.

One lady, like Katie, was a sufferer of visible scars from burns and the pair met through Katie's charity foundation.

Katie Piper launched the UK's first-ever fashion catwalk on Friday and called on one of her friends, who had visible scars from burns, to walk in the show

Launched at the Ideal Home Show, the show - called 'Confidence - The Secret' - aimed to challenge the conventional catwalk.

Speaking to FEMAIL about the initiative ahead of the show, she said: 'I am working with The Ideal Home Show as a fashion and beauty ambassador to launch a bespoke show with alternative catwalk models chosen from my foundation, the Katie Piper Foundation, and Models of Diversity. It's all incredibly exciting.'

The shows, which will also take place on  March  21 and  April 3, have a twist.

The models on the catwalk  bravely admitted what their true insecurities are, which aren’t always the obvious anxiety that people assume.

Whether it be their height, their weight or colour of their hair, the representatives wanted to emphasise that what others assume to be their insecurity isn’t always the case.

The women took to the catwalk in T-shirts emblazoned with the question: 'What do you see?' and when they walked back, their inner most insecurity was displayed on the back of the top

Katie, who was left with severe scarring after being attacked in 2008 when her ex-boyfriend employed an accomplice to throw a cup of industrial-strength sulphuric acid in her face, was keen to reveal hers.

'You might look at me and think that's what I would be insecure about it, but it isn't,' she revealed. 'In fact, it's my height; I would love to be a bit taller.'  

The shows, which starred models with visible differences, will also take place on March 21 and April 3

Katie, who penned several positive affirmation books during her recovery, says an optimistic outlook is one of her secrets to success and she no doubt passed that advice on in today's show

Explaining the inspiration behind the show's name, Katie said: 'It's called Confidence - The Secret because confidence is something you can use to express yourself and convey yourself and it's something I've used through several periods of my life.

'It's not about trying to look and be perfect, it's about a positive mindset and being the best version of yourself that you can possibly be.'

Katie, who  penned several positive affirmation books during her recovery, says an optimistic outlook is one of her secrets to success.

'I can't express how important positive thinking is,' she said. 'When I was recovering from my attack, I would write lots of little powerful notes and stick them around the room. Before I walk onto the red carpet, I have a mantra and always repeat to myself "inhale confidence, exhale doubt"; it really is so powerful.

'It's all about looking at what you do have and not what you don't.' 

This model, an amputee, revealed that she hates her wide hips as she walked the runway 

Katie heeded her own advice recently when she took to the runway for Naomi Campbell's Fashion For Relief catwalk show, which she describes as 'a once in a lifetime opportunity'.

Her catwalk coup kicked off what looks set to be a successful year for Katie. She's penning a new book, due out later this month, is working on a third series of Bodyshockers and has been busy growing her charity.

If that wasn't enough, Katie is planning her wedding, mothering her one-year-old daughter and training for a triathlon, too.

She added: 'No matter what you look like, you can live a full life and that's what I want to show with Confidence - The Secret.' 

Last month, Katie rocked the runway for Naomi Campbell's Fashion For Relief catwalk show, which she describes as 'a once in a lifetime opportunity'
