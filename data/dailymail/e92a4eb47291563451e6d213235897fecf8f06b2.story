According to the history books, five mass extinctions have devastated the planet since it formed 4.6 billion years ago.

But history may have to be rewritten after the discovery of fossils that point to a sixth mass extinction taking place 260 million years ago.

The find suggests that in the Permian period, the world’s creature were almost wiped out twice: once during the ‘Great Dying’ and in an earlier event named the 'Middle Permian' mass extinction.

History may have to be rewritten after the discovery of fossils which point to a sixth mass extinction that took place 260 million years ago.  The fossils were found in the Permian rocks of the Kapp Starostin Formation (pictured) at Spitsbergen which reveal the record of the high latitude Middle Permian extinction

The Great Dying was the worst extinction event of all time killing off 96 per cent of species. Today, all life on Earth is descended from the remaining four per cent of species that survived.

Now researchers from the universities of Hull and Leeds say there is evidence of a major marine extinction in the Arctic just eight million years before the Great Dying.

An extinction event around this time has been the subject of previous studies, but this is the first to document the event in high latitudes. 

'One of the pre-requisites for a “mass extinction” is that it has to be a global event,' Professor David Bond from the University of Hull told MailOnline.

Professor Bond and his colleague Paul Wignall from the University of Leeds found evidence of the extinction in fossils in Isfjorden, Spitsbergen (left). They studied them in layers of rock (right), identifying the species present and building up what they described as 'a range chart'

The find suggests that in the Permian period, the world’s creature were almost wiped out twice. Pictured is a fossil skull of Dinogorgon Rubidgei, sitting on a gravel pile. The fossil is one of many Therapsida which did not survive the Permian extinction, one of the most disastrous extinctions known

'Our study confirms it is a global event, and so we can now say for sure that the event is a true mass extinction.'  

Professor Bond and his colleague Paul Wignall from the University of Leeds found evidence of the extinction in fossils in Isfjorden, Spitsbergen.

They studied them in layers of rock, identifying the species present and building up what they described as 'a range chart'. 

'At a particular layer, many of the different species disappear,' explained Professor Bond. 'This can be spread over several layers - and indeed hundreds of thousands of years - or can be in a single layer.'

Together, the fossils suggest 50 per cent of all marine species died during the event. 

‘We can now say this is a real global mass extinction,’ Professor Bond said after reporting his findings over the weekend at the Geological Society of America meeting in Vancouver, Canada.

Meteor impacts contributed to wiping out species during mass extinction events on Earth

Ordovician-Silurian mass extinction - 443.4 million years ago

This was the third largest extinction in Earth's history, and had two peaks of dying separated by hundreds of thousands of years. Around 26 per cent of all marine families were wiped out and 60 per cent of all genera - an estimated 82-88 per cent of all species.

Late Devonian mass extinction - 375-359 million years ago

Three quarters of all species on Earth died out in the Late Devonian mass extinction, though it may have been a series of extinctions over several million years. Around 22 per cent of all marine families, and 57 per cent of all genera were wiped out - an estimated 79-87 per cent of all species.

Permian mass extinction - 252 million years ago

The Permian mass extinction has been nicknamed The Great Dying, since an incredible 96 per cent of species died out. All life on Earth today is descended from the 4 per cent of species that survived.

Triassic-Jurassic mass extinction - 201 million years ago

There were two or three phases of extinction that made up the Triassic-Jurassic mass extinction event. 22 per cent of all marine families and 53 per cent of all genera - an estimated 76-84 per cent of all species.

Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction - 66 million years ago

The Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction was the event that wiped out the dinosaurs. However, many other organisms perished including 16 per cent of all marine families and 47 per cent of all genera - an estimated 71-81 per cent of all species.

The Middle Permian extinction may have weakened species, causing the Great Dying to have a much more fatal impact than it might otherwise have had, he added.

A number of theories have been proposed for extinction events during the Permian including asteroid impact, volcanic eruptions, methane release or some combination of these.

'We see the loss of carbonates in the aftermath of the extinction across the whole Arctic region – this is consistent with ocean acidification as a kill mechanism in the high latitudes,' said Professor Bond.

'This could have been caused by excessive CO2 release from the Chinese volcanism which gets absorbed by sea water and drives pH down.

'The volcanism would also have caused cooling and warming (both but over different timescales), acid rain, ozone depletion, many other factors – currently we don’t know which of these were responsible.'

The Permian mass extinction has been nicknamed The Great Dying, since an incredible 96 per cent of species died out. All life on Earth today is descended from the 4 per cent of species that survived. Pictured are sail-backed Dimetrodons, which were alive during Earth's Permian period of time

Professor Bond is now hoping for the earlier Permian event to be added to the 'big five' mass extinctions that have so far hit Earth.

Some scientists claim Earth is already in the midst of another mass extinction event, caused by humans who have already killed off over 320 species.

The planet's current biodiversity, the product of 3.5 billion years of evolutionary trial and error, is the highest in the history of life.

In a study published in July, researchers at Stanford University said Earth has reached a tipping point and is in the early stages of a mass extinction event

Since 1500, more than 320 terrestrial vertebrates have become extinct. Populations of the remaining species show a 25 per cent average decline in abundance.

The discovery was made in Spitsbergen, the largest and only permanently populated island of the Svalbard archipelago in northern Norway
