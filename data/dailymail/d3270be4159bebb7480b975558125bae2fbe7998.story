The Cabinet Office has been told to avoid sending lengthy emails when a quick phonecall would be more efficient

Civil servants have been instructed to ditch their emails for some old-fashioned face-to-face communication, after officials found their inboxes were 'bombarded' with unnecessary messages.

Lengthy emails could easily be replaced by quick phonecalls and make their communication a lot more efficient, a new management strategy has found.

Cabinet Office officials have been told to stretch their legs and directly speak to colleagues while any online messages between internal workers have been outlawed on 'no email Thursday'.

The plan to speed up communication is a strategy introduced by Stephen Kelly, the Government's chief operating officer and former Nasdaq executive.

In a video message he told staff his reasons for making them down their keyboards, the Daily Telegraph reported.

'I got in pretty early this morning and I was absolutely overwhelmed and bombarded with the inbox in front of me.

'Obviously, for external stakeholders we have to respond, and respond promptly.

'But internally, let's just get out of our seats and walk around the office and sort stuff out together informally by chatting and having meetings rather than sending long, long, long arduous emails.'

Perhaps it is a good thing that officials are now resorting to direct communication, following one minister's damning criticism of the Government's IT system.

Francis Maude grew so fed up with Whitehall’s ‘clunky and rubbish’ system he had his own personal wi-fi network installed.

He became frustrated at the time it took to log on to government systems and wanted to use his iPad instead for non-sensitive material.

But the Cabinet Office minister was astonished to find that a multi-million contract signed by the Labour government did not include providing an easy wireless web access usually found in coffee shops.

He now wants civil servants to use ‘off the shelf’ computers and mobile phones to cut costs and speed up the way they work.

The coalition has grown increasingly irritated with the way Whitehall buys and uses technology.

A study found civil servants waste the equivalent of three days a year waiting for their computers to turn on.

Mr Maude was forced to take matters into his own hands when he could not get his phone or iPad to work in his Whitehall office.

He preferred not to use a high security computer issued by contractors under the Labour deal because it involved entering numerous passwords and could not use it to surf the internet properly.

Instead he had a wi-fi system installed in his office overlooking Horse Guards Parade so he can bypass government systems and use his iPad to go online.

In June Mr Kelly also revealed his frustrations with Whitehall’s IT: 'I came into the office and I pressed my PC and it took me seven minutes to boot up.

'That's government in the old world, that's three days of the year I waste of my time booting up,' the Standard reported.

'I think the average cost of a desktop [computer] a year is about £6,000. You could go and buy 10 iPads a year.'
