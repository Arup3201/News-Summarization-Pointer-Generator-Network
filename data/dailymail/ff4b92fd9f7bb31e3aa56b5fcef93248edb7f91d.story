A protester sparked fury yesterday by deliberately swimming into the paths of the crews in the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race.

Environmental campaigner Trenton Oldfield was hauled from the water and arrested on public order offences after his actions halted the prestigious event for half an hour.

Last night, the president of the Oxford University Boat Club angrily told Oldfield via Twitter: ‘My team went through seven months of hell. This was the culmination of our careers and you took it from us.’

The university crews were almost neck-and-neck when they were forced to stop after the blades of the Oxford team’s oars narrowly missed Oldfield. A police officer said later: ‘They nearly took his head off.’

Incredibly, it was not the only drama to affect the 158th boat race.

After the event restarted – the first time a restart has been required for 11 years – an Oxford oar snapped when blades from the two teams tangled, allowing Cambridge to cruise to victory.

Then, at the finish line, a member of the Oxford crew collapsed in the boat and had to be taken to hospital.

The crews had set off normally enough at Putney Bridge, South-West London, a little after the scheduled start time of 2.15pm.

More than nine minutes into the race – 
halfway along the four-and-a-quarter-mile course, near Hammersmith 
Bridge – former Olympic rower and race official Sir Matthew Pinsent 
spotted Oldfield in the water. Wearing a wetsuit, the bearded Australian
had plunged into the Thames at the SurreyBend stage of the race, apparently in a protest to highlight his unorthodox political views.

Close shave: Oldfield ducks under the surface to avoid the oars before re-emerging on the other side

Witness Jonathan Finlan, an art dealer of Hyde Park, London, said: ‘I think he must have got there early and stayed lurking in the water, because we never saw him swim out from the riverbank.’

As the boats approached, Oldfield ducked under the water to avoid the oars.

Oxford crew member William Zeng used Twitter to send the protester a series of emotional messages after the race.

Mr Zeng, a doctorate student at Oriel College, tweeted: ‘When I missed your head with my blade I knew only that you were a swimmer, and if you say you are a protester then no matter what you say your cause may be, your action speaks too loudly for me to hear you.

‘I know exactly what you were protesting. You were protesting the right of 17 young men and onewoman to compete fairly and honorably, to demonstrate their hard work and desire in a proud tradition.

‘You were protesting their right to devote years of their lives, their friendships, and their souls to the fair pursuits of the joys and the hardships of sport. You, who would make a mockery of their dedication and their courage, are a mockery of a man.’

Another blow: Medics and the Oxford rowing team aid their bowman Alex Woods after he collapsed at the end of the race. He did not lose consciousness and is said to be in a stable condition

Frustratingly for Oxford, they were enjoying a marginal advantage when race umpire John Garrettbrought the event to a standstill.

As Oldfield resurfaced, smiling broadly, he was picked up by a police boat. Once on dry land, he was led away off Chiswick pier, wrapped in a red blanket.

Onlookers booed and shouted ‘Take him to the Tower!’ and ‘Is that David Walliams?’ – a reference to the comedian who swam the Thames last year for charity.

Police later said Oldfield was being 
detained at a West London police station on suspicion of a Section 5 
public order offence, namely behaviour likely to cause harassment, alarm
or distress.

Describing the drama, Cambridge rower
Steve Dudek said: ‘I saw a head. I looked over and thought they had 
lost a guy [out of Oxford’s boat]. Our cox immediately said, “Stop!” ’

Oxford cox Zoe de Toledo was also forced to take drastic action – quickly alerting her crew to thedanger ahead.

Explaining the decision to interrupt the race, Sir Matthew said the swimmer had risked serious injury.

‘It’s not ideal but what could we do? We could not have carried on,’ he said.

In the other incidents, the blade of Oxford’s German rower Dr Hanno Wienhausen broke after thecrews’ oars clashed. The Oxford crew member who collapsed was Dr Alexander Woods. The 27-year-old Pembroke College medical student was lifted from his seat by medics.

Apparently suffering from exhaustion, he was conscious, but was taken to hospital. He was said to bein a stable condition.

At the end of the race, a clearly upset Ms Toledo appealed for the race to be rerun because there was too much wash on the course after the postponement. Her appeal was turned down by the umpire.

The 2012 race is the first to be disrupted by a swimmer. The last time it had to be restarted was in2001 when there was a clash of blades and an oar was lost.

In further reaction, television presenter Richard Madeley tweeted: ‘God, the monumental ego and selfishness of the swimmer who screwed the Boat Race. Imagine sharing living space with someone like that.’

The quick-witted Oxford cox at the centre of yesterday’s drama appeared in the Oscar-winning film The Social Network.

Zoe de Toledo alerted her crew to the presence of protester Trenton Oldfield when he was just yards from their oars. Footage appeared to show Zoe calling out to the rowers, who were unable to see the man in the Thames.

She played the role of a cox in the 2010 film, which portrayed the early life of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his Harvard University peers, including the Winklevoss twins, Tyler and Cameron.

The twins, who won a multi-million-pound court settlement after claiming Zuckerberg stole their idea for his social networking site, were part of the defeated Oxford crew in 2010.

Zoe, who is studying for an MSc in criminal justice at Oxford, was the only woman in yesterday’s chaotic race.

Film role: The Oxford team member played a cox in 2010's The Social Network

Talking last week about her role, the 
24-year-old, who lives with her fiance in Henley-on-Thames, said: ‘I was
rowing with [Henley’s] Leander Club at the time and we got word that 
they needed extras for a rowing sequence.

'We filmed on the final day of the 
Henley Royal Regatta and then spent six or seven days at Dorney Lake in 
Buckinghamshire doing close-ups.

‘The director David Fincher was trying different things. He was attaching boats together with metal girders and putting cameras here, there and everywhere. It was really interesting and we got paid a little bit as well, which was nice.’

Between takes, Zoe sat chatting with Armie Hammer and Josh Pence, who played the Winklevoss twins.

‘They did a really good job and were good fun. They would tell us stories about their experiences and we would tell them about our lives.’

The filming, which took place in July 2009, evoked fond memories for Zoe. Her grandfather is Oscar-winning sound mixer Simon Kaye, and she spent much of her childhood visiting film sets. ‘I was used to all the waiting around and sudden panic when something is about to happen. I haven’t ruled out going into the film industry.’

Zoe was educated at fee-paying St Paul’s Girls’ School in London, where she first took up rowing. Last year she coxed Britain’s women’s eight team, who finished fourth in the European Rowing Championships. She also won a gold medal at the 2009 World under-23 Championships and a bronze in the 2005 World Junior Championships.
