Police in Dallas are hunting two people linked to the death of a woman who apparently had a botched cosmetic procedure carried out on her buttocks and another who had holes caused by butt injections patched up with superglue.

The suspects, named as Denise Rochelle ‘Wee Wee’ Ross and a transgender person called Jimmy Joe Clarke, also known as Alicia, are wanted for practicing medicine without a licence.

Wykesha Reid, 34, was found dead on a massage table inside a business that performs eyelash extensions on February 19, with her pants partially pulled down and a blood-stained gauze on her butt.

Suspects: Dallas police are hunting Denise Rochelle 'Wee Wee' Ross (left) and Jimmy Joe Clarke - also known as 'Alicia' - (right) who are linked to botched butt injections carried out on two women, one of whom died

The body was found by Clarke and police believe the victim suffered a medical emergency while having injections in her buttocks.

Mrs Reid’s daughter, Keira, told police that her mother had booked a session to have ‘butt injections’ and that a woman who goes by the name of ‘Wee Wee’ and a transgender person were going to carry out the procedure.

Police were also told by another witness whose boyfriend rents the business, in the 3800 block of East Side Avenue, that a person called Wee Wee and Clarke used it to perform butt injections, according to Wfaa.com.

This witness works at the premises performing eyelash extensions and claims that Ross and Clarke arrived on the evening of February 19 and told her and the client she was with to leave.

She also told police that Ross later urged her ‘not to break’ and lie about the fact she uses the premises.

Clarke told police that she had no idea how Reid had died.

The Dallas County Medical Examiner’s Office reported that it found injection marks and a silicone-type substance on the buttocks of Wykesha Reid, 34

She claims that she arrived at the business on February 18 complaining that she ‘was not well and wanted to lay down’, so she locked her in the building overnight and discovered her body when she returned in the morning.

The Dallas County Medical Examiner’s Office reported that it found injection marks and a silicone-type substance on the buttocks of Mrs Reid.

The death follows a complaint to police by a 27-year-old woman who said that she visited 3800 block of East Side on February 9 and paid $520 to have buttock injections, but ended up screaming in agony when ‘unknown’ substances were used on her.

The holes were then closed with superglue, she said.

She later identified Ross and Clarke as the people who carried out the operation. 

The suspects' whereabouts are currently unknown. Neither are registered with the Texas Medical Board.
