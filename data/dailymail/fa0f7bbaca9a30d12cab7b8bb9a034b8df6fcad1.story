Former Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland has found himself at the center of an alleged mistaken identity scandal

Police who thought they had arrested former Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland have been left with egg on their faces - after it was revealed they had in fact been duped by a bold lookalike.

A man who was arrested for burglary and drug possession on July 26 managed to convince cops he was the famous rocker for a month - and the truth only came out after the real deal posted a video of himself in the recording studio on his Facebook page.

The Los Angeles Sheriff's Department even went so far as to give gossip website TMZ a release stating that they had the 46-year-old singer in custody, and it was the resulting story that led Weiland to prove the only place he was locked up was in the studio.

The written statement, titled 'Celebrity 
Arrest', read: 'The suspect, former Stone Temple Pilots band member 
Scott Weiland (46 years of age), was taken into custody for burglary and
 possession of a controlled substance.'

The department confirmed last night through analysing fingerprints that the man was in fact a 44-year-old man named Jason Michael Hurley, who is believed to bear an uncanny residence to Weiland.

'It's a lie,' said Weiland in the video, as he sat 
flanked by backup singers The Wildabouts. 'I've actually been 
touring, writing and recording my new album.'

Weiland's imposter was arrested for stealing razors from a Rite-Aid in Beverley Hills, and was also charged with felony possession of a controlled substance when police found methamphetamine on him.

'It's a lie': Former Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland posted a video proving that he is not currently in jail for drug possession and burglary

Hurley was stopped by a security guard when he was caught allegedly stealing the razors and other toiletry items, but escaped before being caught by officers, who then also found the drugs.

The charge was upped to burglary from 
simple theft because Hurley allegedly carried an insulated bag that 
wouldn't set off sensors, indicating the act was premeditated.

He gave police the name and birth date of his famous lookalike, which resulted in TMZ reporting that Weiland had been in jail for the last four weeks, with the bail set to $95,000.

After being found out, police said Hurley could now also face charges of giving false information to officers.

Back in day: Weiland was fired from the Stone Temple Pilots last year by his band mates for breach of contract and using the group's name to promote his solo career

Weiland 
has faced legal troubles in the past, mostly drug- and alcohol-related, 
and has been in-and-out of rehab over the years.

But he told Canadian reporter Rudy Blair early last month that he has overcome his 'demons.'

'Past
 demons are past demons; that's stuff that I dealt with 14 years ago,' 
he said. 'I mean, I guess Keith Richards gets asked about [his past drug
 use], so why shouldn't I? But it's not something that I think about, 
ever. Those days of my dope abuse, and use, are long since by me.'

In
 2013, he was fired from Stone Temple Pilots and was sued by his former 
band mates for using the group's name to promote his solo career.

He filed a $7 million countersuit, alleging his co-founders were not legally authorised to remove him from the band.
