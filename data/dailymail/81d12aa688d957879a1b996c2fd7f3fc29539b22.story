Ann Duffy pictured arriving at court. She cancelled her brother's wedding without his knowledge because she didn't like his bride-to-be

A woman secretly cancelled her brother’s wedding because she didn’t like his bride-to-be, a court has heard.

Ann Duffy pretended to be her now sister-in-law during a phone call to Plymouth Register Office in Devon and told them she wanted to cancel the wedding.

She then phoned her brother and told him: 'I've saved you on the divorce.'

Plymouth magistrates were told she made the call on November 5 last year, just 20 days before David and Sandra Greatrex were due to wed.

The court heard that the day 50-year-old Duffy cancelled the wedding, she called her brother and said: 'You better put this on speakerphone.

'I have saved you on the divorce. I have cancelled your wedding.

'Would you like me to send you the confirmation email?'

Mr Walden, prosecuting, said her brother’s fiancee then called the police.

He said that the two women's relationship had been experiencing friction over the care of Duffy’s mother.

Mr Page said because she called the pair and told them what she had done, they were able to re-book the wedding the next day.

'One offence doesn’t really constitute a harassment charge,' Mr Walden said.

'There were other incidents that had been reported to police which is why the charge was brought.'

But despite her best efforts, David and Sandra Greatrex managed to reschedule the wedding and have since tied the knot

The couple were able to call the register office and explain the situation

The court heard how during an interview, Duffy had explained about the strained relationship with her sister-in-law over her mother, who had moved in with the couple.

In the interview, Duffy said she was trying to protect her brother from a marriage to someone she dislikes and who she believed was taking her mother away.

Duffy said that she only wanted to cause her sister-in-law distress, and not her brother.

Plymouth magistrates were told she made the call on November 5 last year, just 20 days before the couple were due to wed. She then called her brother and said: 'I have saved you on the divorce. I have cancelled your wedding'

Roger Page, defending, said: 'What we have here is somebody that has pleaded guilty to harassment without violence.

'The defendant still takes the view that her brother is not suited to his wife.

'In desperation to avoid her brother from making what she regarded as a disastrous move she cancelled the wedding.'

Duffy, of Plymouth, Devon, will be sentenced on February 11 following a full pre-sentence report.
