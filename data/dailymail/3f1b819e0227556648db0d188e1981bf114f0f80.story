Fire crews and HAZMAT teams have set up a 200 metre exclusion zone near Sydney's Taronga Zoo after a triple zero call reported a 'noxious smell'. 

HAZMAT crews, specialists who deal with hazardous material and chemical risk, are working to determine if the odour is toxic, as residents on Sirius Cove Road, in Mosman, north-Sydney, have been told to stay in doors until further notice.

A fire and rescue spokesperson said early this morning a garbage truck unknowingly picked up a rubbish bag outside a house which contained chemicals.

The bag broke while being thrown into the back of the truck and has seeped through the rubbish pick-up van, causing a potent odour.

The driver, in his 60s, was treated at the scene by fire rescue authorities and has been taken to Royal North Shore hospital in a stable condition. 

Two council officers who attended the property were also affected and received decontamination treatment.  

Five fire and rescue crews, including a specialist Hazmat unit, remain on the scene.
