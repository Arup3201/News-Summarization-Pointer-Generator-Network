Pop diva Cher caused controversy yesterday when she told her almost two million Twitter followers that she does not celebrate Thanksgiving.

Cher, 67, told a fan that she believes Thanksgiving is a holiday that glorifies 'a great crime.'

She went on to say the day celebrates stealing land from Native Americans who had no concept of property or land ownership and purposely  giving them smallpox.

Thanks for nothing: Cher does not celebrate Thanksgiving because she believes it glorifies crimes against Native American people

Family time: Cher says she and her family get together for a meal and watch movies on Thanksgiving

The revelation began with an expression of gratitude when Cher tweeted, '2 My Crew… I Hope Tomm.is a Glorious day 4 ALL OF U Remember.. A Kind Word, Gesture, Or Compliment can make ANY1′s DAY! THANX4BeingThere4Me.'

A Twitter follower then tweeted, '@Cher you don’t celebrate the holiday I thought? Or was that something I was just told?'

She responded, emphatically, that she doesn't.

'I DON’T !' tweeted Cher, explaining that it's a day when she can share a meal with her family and watch a movie.

'Not 2 celebrate the beginning of a GREAT Crime,' she tweeted. 

Daring: Cher has never been a shrinking violet and has long been known for being outspoken about her political views

Another Twitter follower asked her to elaborate on what 'crime' she was referring to, and Cher explained her comment.'Stealing Land, from a ppl, Who believed, Owning Land Was LIke Owning SKY!'

Cher, who has Cherokee ancestry, is known for her left-wing views and once said George W. Bush's eight years in office 'almost killed' her. In September 2013, the pop chameleon declined an invitation to perform at the 2014 Winter Olympics opening ceremony in Russia due to the country's controversial anti-gay legislation.
