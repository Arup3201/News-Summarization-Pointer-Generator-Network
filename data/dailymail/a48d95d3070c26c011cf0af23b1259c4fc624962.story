A government investigation criticized a bizarre Secret Service assignment that pulled armed agents away from guarding the President and his family flying in Marine One and sent them to guard the home of a senior agent arguing with her neighbor instead.

Indeed, according to Ronald Kessler's book, The First Family detail were diverted from watching Marine One at a time when intelligence reports had been received that a missile attack on the helicopter was being planned. 

The conduct amounted to a 'serious lapse in judgment,' the inspector general of the Homeland Security Department, John Roth, said in a statement,

'These agents, who were there to protect the president and the White House, were improperly diverted for an impermissible purpose.'

Agency officials have strenuously denied Barack Obama's safety was ever compromised.

Family guard: Secret Service agents occupy cars outside the White House and are meant to guard for any outside attacks on Marine One as it lifts off from the lawn. In 2011 their posts were allegedly not manned

However, the report says that the president was at the White House on at least two days that the agents were 'a 50-minute drive (without traffic) from the White House and found no legal justification for using Secret Service agents for such a purpose.

Compared to that failure and other incidents, including a prostitution scandal in Colombia, 'Operation Moonlight' stands as a strange side note. 

It happened three years ago but came to light this past May in a report in The Washington Post.

A Secret Service employee who worked as the assistant to then-director Mark Sullivan was involved in a dispute with her neighbor, who was harassing her and assaulted her father. 

This 'resulted in the loss of several of her father's teeth,' the report says.

Local police arrested the neighbor, and the employee, Lisa Chopey, sought out a protective order. 

But it didn't stop there. 

She told investigators that Keith Prewitt, then the deputy director of the Secret Service, was a family friend. 

And when he heard her story, Prewitt told A.T. Smith, then the assistant director for investigations, that the Secret Service should do something to help her out.

Smith directed one of his managers to have agents drive out to Chopey's home in La Plata, Maryland to check on her. 

The report says that Sullivan, the agency director who's since retired, was made aware of that decision, but Sullivan disputed that in a statement Wednesday, saying that he'd only learned of the checks being made on Chopey after they'd already stopped.

The agents assigned to the task were from the agency's so-called 'Prowler' unit, a rotating team of two special agents who are supposed to respond to suspicious people and situations in and around the White House and national capital area. 

Prowler teams are not part of the presidential protective division, and agency personnel interviewed for the report insisted their protective function was not compromised. 

The mission was over before long — five days of visits are documented, with the longest lasting eight hours.

But the report notes that during those times, 'the Prowler team would have been unable to respond to exigencies at the White House.' And on at least two of those occasions, Obama was in the residence.  

A government investigation uncovered an operation that had Secret Service agents tasked with guarding the White House travelling an hour outside the city to help a coworker with a dispute with a neighbor, something agency deputy director A.T. Smith (above) was aware of

The agents sent out were part of the Prowler unit, tasked with responding to suspicious people and situations in and around the White House and national capital area.

The report by the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security is another embarrassment for the Secret Service, which is responsible for guarding the president and his family. Julia Pierson resigned as director of the agency this month after a series of scandals.

The report said top Secret Service officials diverted agents on its plainclothes "Prowler" team, which patrols around the White House, on five days in July 2011 to monitor a fellow employee's personal dispute with a neighbor. President Barack Obama was in the White House on two of those days.

"These agents, who were there to protect the president and the White House, were improperly diverted for an impermissible purpose. This constituted a serious lapse in judgment," Inspector General John Roth said in a statement.

The incident began when an unnamed employee in the director's office told her supervisor that an altercation with a neighbor had led to her father being assaulted, "which resulted in the loss of several of her father's teeth," the seven-page report said.

Keith Prewitt, the now-retired Secret Service deputy director, thought the agency should help the employee. A.T. Smith, then the assistant director for investigations and now deputy director, ordered security checks on the worker's home in rural Maryland, a 50-minute drive from the White House without traffic.

This is all happening just a few weeks after Julia Pierson stepped down as head of the agency over numerous lapses in security

Roth's report found no legal or procedural justification for the checks and said the Secret Service should have stayed out of a dispute best handled by local police. The incident was reported by the Washington Post in May.

Secret Service spokesman Brian Leary said the agency had received Roth's report to Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and was reviewing it for findings.

The inspector general's report comes a month after a U.S. veteran armed with a knife got inside the White House.

That breach was followed by the revelation that an armed security contractor with a criminal record rode on an elevator with Obama last month, along with new details about a 2011 incident in which shots were fired at the White House.

The agency's reputation also was tarnished in 2012 when it was reported that members had hired prostitutes in Colombia ahead of an Obama visit.

Utah's Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who is leading investigations of the Secret Service as chairman of an oversight subcommittee, said that Smith should be fired
