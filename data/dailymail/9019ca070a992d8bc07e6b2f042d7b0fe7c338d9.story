A Brazilian glamour model has been slammed for posing against the trail of destruction left by superstorm Sandy.

Nana Gouvea, 30, who has reportedly graced the pages of Playboy, posted a series of images to her Facebook page showing her leaning against fallen trees and standing on top of wrecked cars in the streets of New York.

The photographs instantly sparked outcry, and Gawker mocked: ‘The turmoil following a devastating natural disaster is a great opportunity to get out there and try poses, angles, and wardrobe choices you normally wouldn’t.

‘This is a time for introspection and re-examining your personal style. Also a great time to stomp all over cars and things.’

A Facebook page and tumblr account, both titled Nana Gouvêa in Disasters, also poke fun at the brunette model.

They show pictures of her superimposed onto a number of tragic scenes, including the sinking of the Titanic, the Hindenburg disaster and the death of Mufasa in The Lion King.

Ms Gouvea’s husband, Carlos Keyes, was responsible for capturing the original images of her, which she proudly displayed on her Facebook account.

She told Spanish magazine, EGO, that 
the storm has bought them closer together and ‘we actually spent most of
 the time in bed’, adding that ‘today I will open a bottle of wine’.

According
 to the publication this is the second hurricane the duo have 
experienced, as they first met when Hurricane Irene hit the East Coast 
last August.

‘It was my first trip to New York,’ Ms Gouvea exclaimed, ‘we were in his apartment, watching movies, cooking.’

More than 50 people are known to have died in the storm, thousands of homes are underwater and millions remain without power.
