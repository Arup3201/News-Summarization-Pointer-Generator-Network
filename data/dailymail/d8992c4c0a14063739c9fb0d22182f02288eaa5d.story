At 50st, Pauline Potter became the world's heaviest woman

After entering herself into the Guinness Book of Records, her ex wanted her back

She has lost a stone a month thanks to their marathon sex sessions

After divorcing her husband three years ago, Pauline Potter - already a whopping 46stone - piled on so much extra weight that she became the heaviest woman in the world.

But at a staggering 50stone, her ex-husband Alex (a svelte 11stone), couldn't resist her and set out to win her back and reignite their sex life.

The couple now have marathon sex sessions of up to seven times in one day and Pauline maintains that the 'sexercise' is what's keeping her slim.

The 'sexathons' with Alex, who has visited her twice a month for four days at a time, have had a dramatic effect on her size, helping her shed a stone each month by sweating off the calories.

'I can't move much in bed, but I burn 500 calories a session-it's great exercise just jiggling around,' she told Closer Magazine.

Even though one of Pauline's legs weighs more than Alex does, the couple are able to enjoy sex using different positions.

And although Pauline isn't yet confident enough to buy sexy lingerie, she drapes a nice sheet over her to achieve the same effect in the bedroom.

The 47-year-old, who as a 19-year-old son Dillion from a previous marriage, met Alex in 2002 online and they married three years later.

After their marriage hit the rocks, the daycare centre worker moved to California in 2008 with Dillion and that is when she hit rock bottom and her weight spiraled out of control.

At a staggering 50st, Pauline weighed in at the world's heaviest woman after gorging on a diet of 10,000 calories each day

Pauline was so low that she turned to food, often binging on four bowls of cereal for breakfast, half a box of cookies and a bag of crisps with cheese as a mid-morning snack.

McDonald's was her lunchtime venue, where she opted for a Big mac, chips and nuggets followed by three portions of spaghetti bolognaise for dinner and a pint of ice cream for dessert.

Gorging on 10,000 calories each day, Pauline was so fat that her son had to accompany her to the toilet.

After reaching her highest weight ever, with a BMI on 93 (the healthy range for a women her age being 18/5-25), Pauline's health suffered greatly.

She couldn't leave the house without a motorised scooter and she suffered lymphedema, which got so bad that she eventually became immobile.

The drive behind her weight loss desires came last September when, at a whopping 52st, she was crowned World's Fattest Woman.

In July she made a dramatic move and entered herself into the Guinness Book of Records to shame herself into dieting.

It was when Alex saw she had clinched the Guinness World Record for her enormous size, that he rushed to move back in with his former partner in Sacramento, California.

She is now motivated to reach her target weight of 38st in order to become mobile enough to move in with Alex, who currently lives in Arizona.

She told Closer: 'I still eat Big Macs, but I'll choose between fries or nuggets.

'I tell Alex he needs to visit more so he can help me shed the pounds quicker!'
