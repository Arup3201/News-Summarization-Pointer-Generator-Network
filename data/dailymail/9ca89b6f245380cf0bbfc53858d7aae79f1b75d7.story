Sir Michael Stoute will launch a two-horse assault on Saturday’s £650,000 Ladbrokes St Leger after it was confirmed that Kings Fete will join Snow Sky at Doncaster on Saturday.

Both horses are owned by Khaled Abdullah, whose No 1 jockey James Doyle is poised to ride Stoute’s seeming first string, Gordon Stakes winner and Great Voltigeur Stakes runner-up Snow Sky, the 5-1 second favourite.

Abdullah’s racing manager Lord Grimthorpe said he hoped Ryan Moore would ride whichever mount Doyle rejected. The three-time champion rode Kings Fete in his work at the weekend

Kings Fete, a 16-1 shot, had looked an unlikely Leger runner, his refusal to settle in his races leading to a failure to deliver on his potential for Stoute, who the Leger with Conduit in 2008.

But Grimthorpe said: ‘Kings Fete worked himself onto the team on Saturday morning. Sir Michael is keen for him to take his chance.

‘He has to mature and settle a bit better but Sir Michael has always had a very high opinion of him. He feels he is a work in progress.’

Fifteen have been left in the final Classic, headed by Roger Varian’s Derby runner-up Kingston Hill, the 5-2 favourite.

Varian’s fears that the ground will get too firm for his colt have been eased by the 14mm rain which fell at the track over the weekend.

Doncaster officials are now predicting the going on race day should be no quicker than Good.

Newmarket trainer John Gosden, who has won the race four times, runs Derby third Romsdal, Forever Now and Marzocco as he chases a win that will go a long way to securing a second trainers’ championship.

Also likely to be three-handed is Mark Johnston, who has declared Alex My Boy, Royal Ascot winner Hartnell and Somewhat.

Aidan O’Brien looks like relying on Great Voltigeur fifth Granddukeoftuscany. His other entry, Kingfisher, is scheduled to join dual Derby winning stablemate Australia in the Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown later in the day.
