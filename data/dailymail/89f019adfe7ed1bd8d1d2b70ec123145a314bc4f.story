A woman jumped into her neighbour's paddling pool after her barbecue exploded leaving her with severe burns to the face and arms.

Lizl Donnelly, 42, was injured after a leak in a gas pipe caused the blast at her home in Milnrow, Rochdale, Greater Manchester.

Within seconds, the mother-of-two leaped over a small fence and into the paddling pool, which had been left full in their communal garden because of the hot weather.

Lizl Donnelly's gas barbecue exploded because of a leak in the pipe, but the quick-thinking mother jumped into her neighbour's paddling pool to ease the pain of her burned arm and face

Mrs Donnelly, 42, stayed in the water while paramedics treated her injuries with burns dressings

She stayed in the water as paramedics treated her wounds and put burns dressings on the affected parts of her body.

Mrs Donnelly said: 'It had only been on a minute. I 
turned it on, walked into the kitchen, came back out and smelt gas. I 
went to inspect the pipe and, when I touched it, it just went up in a 
flash.

'I felt like I was on fire but I donâ€™t
think I was. The only thing I could think of was to get in the cold 
water. My face and arm were burning like anything, they were really 
sore.'

Her daughter Taylor, 17, was in the garden when the gas barbecue exploded while her son Andrew, 13, was playing video games inside.

She said: 'I was really worried about the kids because I thought the barbecue could just go up at any time.'

Her husband John, 45, was on a business trip to London at the time.

She said: 'I texted him a picture of me in hospital and he said I looked like a right plonker.'

Mrs Donnelly, a cafe owner, was taken to the Royal Oldham Hospital but was discharged within hours.

She said she was lucky that her injuries were not serious and the pain had subsided quickly.

But she added that, as a South African, 
she would struggle to live the incident down because cooking outdoors is
popular in her country.

Despite her injuries, Lizl Donnelly says she has not been put off having another barbecue in the future

Despite her injuries, Mrs Donnelly has not been put off having another barbecue in the future.

Firefighter Kristian Meredith, who attended the scene, said: 'For anyone planning barbecues in the warm weather and getting their gas barbecues out of storage, check the gas pipes for any ruptures before lighting them to avoid this kind of fire.

'She was very lucky the paddling pool was there.'
