A new species of Frog has been discovered thriving in New York - after scientists were drawn to the creatures' 'very odd' chorus call.

The newly-named Atlantic Coast leopard frog was first noticed hopping around wetlands in the shadow of Yankee Stadium in the Bronx.

Jeremy Feinberg, a scientist at Rutgers University in New Jersey, was intrigued by the animals' unusual chorus call.

Hip to the hoppa: A new species of frog has been discovered living in New York after scientists noticed the animal's unusual chorus call

The frog looks identical to other leopard frogs but Mr Feinberg felt certain it's distinctive 'chuck' call was like nothing he had heard before.

So he teamed up with genetics experts, and tests proved him right - the frog was an entirely new species.

The new frog has been given the Latin name Rana Kauffeldi in honour of New York wildlife expert Carl Kauffeld, who first suggested there may be an unidentified species of frog in the area in 1937.

Sadly, Mr Kauffeld died in 1974 aged 63 before being able to prove his theory, as genetic testing technology was not available at the time.

Colonies of the frog have been discovered across New York's five boroughs. It has since been found to inhabit a coastal strech from Connecticut in the north to Virginia and North Carolina in the south

Mr Feinberg told BBC News: 'Frogs have very stereotyped calls within a species, so I knew this was different.

'But it took me two years to find someone to partner with me on the genetics side.

'This is only the third new species of frog to be discovered north of Mexico since 1986

"What also makes this crazy is that it's in a urban area - [that's] what makes it a double whammy.

"You wouldn't find it hopping around Times Square" -

'[These frogs] probably require wetland areas of something on the average minimum of 10 acres or more.

The frog has since been found to inhabit a coastal stretch from Connecticut in the north to Virginia and North Carolina in the south.

A large colony was discovered thriving on Staten Island.
