It's hard to imagine what it would be like to suddenly find out that you have won £6million on the Lotto.

So to give us a taste the National Lottery has released audio of the moment five lucky winners found out that they were Britain's latest millionaires.

Mostly they are calling with disbelief at their new found riches followed by the joy at the realisation that they will soon have a seven-figure bank account.

Scroll down for audio...

Ecstatic: Carly Wiggett (R) and Becky Witt (L), from Dartford, Kent, won £336,277.60 on Friday 22nd March's EuroMillions. They only played the game because their horoscopes told them to 

One player, Tracy Tyler, from Epping Forrest, Essex, won the jackpot last month and pocketed £5,819,806.

Her voice slightly trembling, she asked the Camelot representative: 'I've just got six numbers on the lottery and I'm having a brain spasm, can you help me?'

She tells the operator she's got her ticket in front of her and she's 'shaking like a leaf'.

When the full amount is read out, Ms 
Tyler responds: 'You're telling me I'm the only winner of the lottery 
and I've won £5 million pounds?' as someone is heard yelling in the 
background.

The operator 
sounds almost as shocked as Ms Tyler and says: 'From what you are teling
 me with those numbers, yes, that's right, there was only one jackpot 
winner tonight. Yes, that's right. Wow. I know it will take a while. 
It's a lot to take in. Wow.'

Lee Orchard, from St Austell, Cornwall, won £1million on a Gold National Lottery Scratchcard in March. 'Honestly, thanks mate. Brilliant,' he told the Camelot operator

Jackpot: Tracy Tyler and Adam Young couldn't believe their luck when Tracy's ticket scooped the Lotto jackpot of £5.8million last month

Reflecting on that unforgettable moment, she said; 'Even now I get goose bumps hearing the call - it’s still so exciting. I can remember innocently saying, "can you just tell me how much it would be?" and when the lady on the other end said, "five million, eight hundred and nineteen thousand, eight hundred and six pounds" I thought I must be hearing things.'

In another recording, Carly Wiggett calls to check if the EuroMillions ticket she bought with her friend Becky Witt, both from Dartford, Kent, is a winner.

When it is confirmed the ecstatic girl tells the operator that they only bought the ticket together because of their horoscopes.

She
 said her star sign told her to 'team up' with someone, and her friend's
 said to play the lottery, so they bought a ticket together and chose 
the numbers at random.

Andy Garth, from Middlesborough, scooped £1 million in the EuroMillions Millionaire Raffle on Christmas Day last year.

Overcome: Andrew Garth, from Middlesborough, couldn't hold back the urge to profess his love for the operator, telling her: 'Oh my God, I love you!'

Thrilled: EuroMillions Millionaire Raffle winners Keith and Trish Williams from Merthyr Tydfil, Wales, who were one of the 100 raffle winners from  a draw last month

When his winning ticket was confirmed he yelled 'Yes' hysterically and announced his love for the operator.

As he laughs out loud, he says: 'Oh my god I love you.'

Mr Garth told the Camelot rep it was also his birthday on Boxing Day, so the win couldn't' have come at a better time.

The National Lottery has made around 30 millionaires a month across the last year, as well as numerous other major prize winners.

was only one jackpot winner tonight. Yes, that's right. Wow. I know it

'Are you in a private room on your own?''No I'm just with a friend, it's no problem. Why?''Are you sure it's alright for me talk in front of somebody else?''Yeah, it's fine.''Are you sitting down?''Yes I am sitting down.''It looks as though you have won one of the raffle numbers winning £1million pounds.''A million pounds?'

Oh my word. Thank you so much.'
