Forget sausage and mash and Sunday roasts, the latest food fads are moving away from the traditional and embracing the unusual, according to a list of top trends in a leading magazine.

Thanks to outlandish recipes championed by leading chefs like Heston Blumenthal, vegetables masquerading as dessert and an obsession with mould have made Olive magazine's list of top trends for 2013.

Chefs presenting their food on building materials such as bricks and tiles will also be a big favourite this year according to the list.

Following in Heston's footsteps? The latest food trends are moving more away from the traditional and embracing the unusual according to Olive magazine

Trend setter: Tuddenham Mill in Suffolk serves a savoury chestnut, salted caramel and artichoke dessert

Among those already embracing that trend is chef Ben Spalding whose 'lick a brick' stunt during a recent stint at Islington's John Salt saw customers licking chicken mousse and caramel from a London brick.

Meanwhile, diners at Gail's Kitchen in Holborn can enjoy a truffled taleggio toastie served on a miniature tile.

For foodies looking for something a little more out there than apple crumble for dessert, a savoury chestnut, salted caramel and artichoke dessert at Tuddenham Mill in Suffolk and candied celeriac at Nottingham's Sat Bains also gained acclaim in the list.

Customers can also sample 'rotten' food cultured in Kilner preserving jars in the latter's cellar.

But some new twists on popular classics were also recognised.

Savoury doughnuts and a 'posh' makeover for condensed milk that sees it fried with bananas and used to sweeten porridge were praised by the magazine.

Olive editor Christine Hayes said: 'Something odd is happening in the food scene. Weirdness is in, in a big way, with the most outlandish ideas catching on in a way that simply hasn't happened before.

'Normal rules are being thrown out of the window.

'It might not be to everyone's taste but it really helps to highlight the extent to which the UK is leading the world in innovation.'
