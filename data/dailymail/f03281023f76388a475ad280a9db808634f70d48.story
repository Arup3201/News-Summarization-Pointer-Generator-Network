Manchester City's investment in their squad reached an incredible £175million in the space of four days when striker Sergio Aguero signed a new five-year contract with the Premier League champions on Thursday night.

Aguero’s £150,000-a-week deal was confirmed in the wake of David Silva and Vincent Kompany also committing their futures to the club until 2019. City kicked off the week by paying FC Porto £32million to make Eliaquim Mangala the most expensive defender in the history of British football.

Despite signing Mangala on a five-year deal worth £100,000-a-week, City are still within the transfer limit of £49m net placed on them this summer by UEFA for breaching Financial Fair Play regulations.

Blue moon rising: Sergio Aguero has become the latest player to commit his future to Manchester City

But the hat-trick of new deals for Aguero, Silva and Kompany represents a stunning statement of intent. Kompany is understood to be earning a basic £120,000 and Silva £140,000.

Including bonuses, City’s financial commitment to the four players could top £200m over the course of the next five years and they still plan to offer new deals to Joe Hart, Edin Dzeko and James Milner.

Aguero, 26, insisted last night that he will stay at the Etihad until the end of his new contract, and the Argentina striker hopes that it will end talk of him joining Real Madrid or Barcelona.

‘The reality seems to be that ever since I came here, during every close season, there has always been rumours suggesting that I might be returning to Spain,’ said Aguero.

‘There has always been this speculation and I certainly never pay much attention to it. But people hear this stuff flying around and they take it seriously.

‘I can tell the fans and everyone at City to relax, I’m going to be here until I see out my contract.

‘I’ve been here for three years now and fortunately things have gone fairly well so far. We’ve just got carry on in the same way, winning titles.

‘I think the club is investing well in order to be up there with the best in the world.

Aguero finished last season as City’s top scorer with 28 goals despite missing much of the second half of the campaign with a succession of groin, hamstring and calf injuries.

He is expected to be out of first-team action for another three weeks after representing Argentina in the World Cup Finals and revealed that he now comes into training 90 minutes earlier to make sure there are no more injury setbacks.

‘That’s been happening since I got back here,’ he added. ‘I have to get in an hour-and-a-half early and start off with strength exercises. Then I work on stability in my hips and sides, and then the rest is more straightforward just to strengthen the pelvic area in order to prevent any further injuries of the sort that I’d been having.

‘So I’ll do about an hour before training, then it will be out there as normal with the rest of the group. I’ll follow that programme throughout the whole season.’

Captain fantastic: Vincent Kompany has also signed a new deal as City chase successive league titles

Aguero famously scored a last-gasp winner on the final day of the season in 2012 to snatch the title from Manchester United, and he believes that City’s neighbours will be the main threat to their crown again.

‘I think who is most worthy of having the best chance to threaten is Manchester United,’ he said. ‘They are not involved in any other competitions other than the English knockout cups and the Premier League.

‘That means they’ll get more rest between games than ourselves and some of the other teams and that will work in their favour, like it did last season with Liverpool.’
