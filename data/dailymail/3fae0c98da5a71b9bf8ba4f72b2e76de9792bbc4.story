A former surgeon at the hospital where Jimmy Savile had an office has been accused of sexually abusing a patient from the age of four.

Bruce Bailey, who worked at the world-renowned Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire, allegedly attacked the girl while reading her bedtime stories.

She says the plastic surgeon, who died in 2001, then raped her when she was 11 as she waited to have an operation.

Bailey is believed to have known paedophile DJ and TV presenter Savile, the Sunday Mirror reported today.

Bailey's alleged victim, now in her 50s, said the abuse took place at a time when she underwent more than 100 ­operations.

'The first time I was abused by Mr Bailey was when I was just four,' she said. 'I remember being completely ­terrified and confused.

'Soon after he abused me again while he read me a bedtime story on the ­children's ward. I was recovering from my operation,' she told the Sunday Mirror.

'I was a tiny child – I froze and did 
not say anything, I was too scared. Each time I was re-admitted I would 
plead not to be left.'

The 
alleged victim - who says she was also indecently assaulted by Savile - 
claims a junior doctor saw Bailey indecently touching her but nothing 
was done.

Bailey is the second doctor at the hospital in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, to be accused of abusing patients.

Dr Michael Salmon, who worked Stoke Mandeville, is accused of rape and four counts of indecent assault.

The 78-year-old is alleged to have carried out the attacks in hospitals across Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, over a 13-year period between 1972 and 1983.

A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said the charges stemmed from the Metropolitan Police's Operation Yewtree - the investigation into the Jimmy Saville abuse scandal.

Salmon, from Woodgreen, Hampshire, was arrested by detectives and then later charged.

He has been bailed to appear at Aylesbury Magistrates' Court on December 17.

Last week it emerged new sex abuse claims against Jimmy 
Savile are being made weekly, as the number of 
hospitals under investigation over the scandal more than doubled to 32.

Health
 Secretary Jeremy Hunt said an extra 19 hospitals had been caught up in 
the scandal, in addition to 13 already subject to an urgent inquiry.

It suggests the disgraced former BBC 
presenter’s abuse of children on NHS premises may have been more regular
and more serious than those offences committed at the Corporation.
