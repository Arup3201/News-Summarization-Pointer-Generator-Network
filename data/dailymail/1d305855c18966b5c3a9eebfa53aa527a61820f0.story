Motorists experienced an early taste of Olympic chaos to come today as preparation work on new VIP ‘Games Lanes’ caused severe delays and tail-backs of up to two hours on several key routes into the capital.

The gridlock came as Transport for London imposed restrictions while work was carried out on the reserved lanes, which are designed to speed up the journeys of Olympic VIPs and athletes from Wednesday.

But drivers in and around the capital suffered today as work preparing the lanes got underway ahead of their official introduction.

Worse to come: Traffic jams formed on the A40 and other major routes into London today with days to go until the Games

This preparatory work includes closing off some side-roads, banning some existing turns, and phasing traffic lights to red to give priority to official Games vehicles.

Queues built up at major routes as transport chiefs phased lights to red to deter drivers from entering the capital.

Traffic information company INRIX, 
which supplies data to Sat-Nav firms, said a lane restriction on the A13
Newham Way in east London led to two-hour delays for traffic heading 
into London.

It also reported delays of up to 90 
minutes for drivers coming into London on the M40 due to a lane 
restriction on the A40 at Hanger Lane in west London.

It noted: ‘Congestion double on the 
A12, A13 and A40 from 36 minutes of congestion on an average Monday to 
80 minutes this morning.

‘Motorists struggled with 2-hour 
journeys from the M40 at Denham in to the Westway, with a similar time 
to travel between Dagenham and Aldgate on the A13. Journeys on the A12 
between Redbridge and Blackwall were taking an hour as well.’

Other worst affected routes were the A234 at Crystal Palace and the M20 into the city centre.

There was further chaos as a man dived head-first off Tower Bridge into the Thames during a protest by taxi drivers over their ban from using the Olympics Games Lanes network.

Police pulled him from the water under the landmark bridge, from which Olympic rings are suspended to celebrate the 2012 London Games, and arrested him on a public order offence.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman told the BBC: 'Around 4pm a man who was taking part in a planned demonstration jumped into the River Thames from Tower Bridge.

'Officers from the marine policing unit rescued the man. He has been arrested for a public order offence.'

The man, who has not been named, had been taking part in the protest by London taxi drivers over a decision to keep them off part of a road network reserved for Olympic athletes.

The drivers are worried that they will be stuck in congestion and will lose money during the Games.

Yellow route:
Roads on this route have a dedicated 'Olympic-only' lane for athletes, 
officials, VIPs, sponsors and media. The lanes will be in force from 6am
until midnight.Red route:
Roads on this route, the busiest 'core section' of the VIP network, 
will be affected by major restrictions to speed up traffic but will be 
fully open to the public. Measures could include bans on parking and 
right-turns, suspension of pedestrian crossings, phasing of traffic 
lights and no public entry from side roads.Blue route: Roads
on this route will only be affected on competition days. They will run 
from the athletes' accommodation to venues such as Wembley Arena, Earls 
Court and Wimbledon.

Drivers in central London were also hit, with tailbacks in Holborn, Whitehall and Parliament Square.

A two-car crash on the M4 motorway 
brought traffic to a near standstill on the eastbound Heathrow link - a 
key route for thousands of Olympic officials and athletes arriving at 
Heathrow which has its own ‘Games lane’ which opened last Monday.

It highlights how unplanned incidents can quickly escalate gridlock.

The jams are a taste of things to 
come  as motorists brace themselves for further misery when the 30 miles
of Olympic-only ‘Zil’ lanes are activated for Wednesday’s rush hour.

There were severe delays today on one of the key Tube lines that will ferry people to the Olympics.

The problem was at North Greenwich close to the Olympic site at Stratford.

It meant long hold ups on the Jubilee line in the early part of the morning rush hour.

The delays also affected passengers on the London Overground - another key Olympic route.

The full 107-mile Olympic Road 
Network, including the controversial reserved 30 miles of ‘Games Lanes’,
go live from 6am on Wednesday ahead of the opening ceremony on Friday, 
with drivers straying into them facing £130 fixed penalty fines.

Meanwhile, more than 1,300 sets of traffic lights are being altered to give priority to Olympic vehicles.

AA president Edmund King said: 
‘Re-phasing of lights is probably having more effect than Games lanes, 
most of which are not in force until Wednesday. School holidays normally
sees a drop in traffic but that certainly wasn’t felt this morning. The
west side of M25 was incredibly slow from 7am.’

There was widespread confusion among 
motorists and cyclists in central London struggling with hundreds of 
banned turns, including on the Victoria Embankment - a key route between
the Olympic Park and VIP hotels in Park Lane -  following a right turn 
into Northumberland Avenue being blocked off over the weekend.

By contrast, roads where traffic was 
not artificially constrained by re-phased traffic lights were 
exceptionally quiet at the start of the school holidays, against a 
background of repeated warnings from transport bosses to avoid central 
London.

Tomorrow will be the busiest day for 
Olympic ‘family’ arrivals, with 1,262 athletes and coaches and 3,,008 
officials arriving at Heathrow in West London.

Thursday – the day before the Olympic
opening ceremony – will be the busiest day for overall arrivals at 
Heathrow Airport, with more than 127,000 people arriving.

London mayor Boris Johnson said of 
the rush-hour traffic as he headed into a meeting of the Government’s 
emergency planning team, Cobra: ‘It’s moving.’

A Transport for London spokesman 
urged drivers to avoid central London, noting: ’Up to one million extra 
visitors are expected in London every day during the Games, making an 
additional three million journeys over and above the usual 12 million 
daily journeys on public transport.’

Leon Daniels, Transport for London’s 
managing director for surface transport said: ‘We will continue to 
monitor the impact of signal and road changes on the road network to 
ensure that we keep London moving and deliver the journey times that are
required on the Olympic Road Network for the Games.’
