He split from ex wife Camille two years ago, but their marriage is still apparently a very sore subject for Kelsey Grammer.

The Boss star, who is now happily married to British flight attendant Kayte Walsh, sat down with Oprah Winfrey on Sunday for an emotional interview on Oprah’s Next Chapter.

With his new wife by his side, Kelsey opened up about everything from his new hit television series, to his contentious divorce from Camille Grammer.

Kelsey, who refused to utter Camille’s name, revealed that  - for him - the 13 year marriage was over before it even started, telling Oprah he remained out of duty to the former Playboy model.

'I stayed because I’m a stubborn cuss. I was not in it, or happy in it for a long time. It was pretty much over as soon as it began,' Kelsey said.

While he refused to say her name, the actor didn't hold back when it came to his ill feelings toward Camille.

'She always wanted to be famous,' Kelsey said before admitting he helped her secure a role on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.

'I did believe that I owed something to that person,' he added about his appearances on the Bravo reality show adding, 'that I owed fame.'

The actor and producer then sarcastically remarked: 'Because she’d given up so much to endure this life with me.'

It should be noted that Kelsey's divorce from Camille was not finalized until February 10, 2011.
