There should be no problem with Frank Lampard's move to New York City being delayed until July, according to MLS commissioner Don Garber.

The England international was supposed to move to America to begin training with his new side early in 2015 but his form with parent club Manchester City saw the Premier League champions extend his stay under Manuel Pellegrini.

Many New York fans were outraged that they had been 'lied to' over Lampard's situation in a ploy to sell season tickets, but Garber insists that most Designated Players coming from Europe don't join up with their new team until the summer.

'They [Man City] were faced with a difficult decision,' Garber told Grant Wahl of Sports Interactive. 

'I'm going to be supportive of all our ownership groups, making them aware of my point of view. But we need to work hard now to move forward and recognize that Frank will be joining this team in July along with other Designated Players, who throughout the history of the Designated Player program have almost always joined in July. 

'If there was an error in judgment on this, it was not just announcing that he would come in July and figuring out how to manage the start of the season, no different than what happened with Robbie Keane or Thierry Henry or David Beckham.

Garber also spoke about the possibility of Steven Gerrard arriving stateside, admitting their had been discussions with the Liverpool captain's representatives but that nothing had been signed.

When questioned about supporters in the Big Apple voicing their discontent over Lampard, he referenced an 'unusual set of circumstances' which will have swayed Man City's decision.

He added: 'Frank has become one of the most important players in Man City's season, and he's scored critical goals to have them tied for first place in the Premier League.'
