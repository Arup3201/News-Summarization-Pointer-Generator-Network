Think you can’t have lunch for under a fiver? We’re here to tell you that you can. But it will mean changing some lunchtime habits. 

You will need to steer clear of popular options such as Pret, Whole Foods, Eat and Crussh and start going to supermarkets for your sarnie, salad and snack. 

And while an Asda sandwich or a Tesco salad might not be the most glamorous of lunches, you could end up saving between £2 to £5 a day, depending on your food choices. 

While they may have some enticing options salad bars and hot lunch counters can often ending costing a lot 

While we all love hearty office lunch, the cost of a daily takeaway can be crippling  

While we all love hearty office lunch, the cost of a daily takeaway can be crippling.  

The combined cost of a sandwich, drink and a snack from popular lunchtime outlets can often come up to more than £6 a day. 

For instance a Pret a Manger lunch of a chicken and avocado sandwich (£3.25) with a bottle of pomegranate and hibiscus still water (£1.65) and a slice of banana cake (£1.60) comes up to £6.50, which when multiplied by five (assuming you work Monday to Friday) will cost you a whopping £32.50 a working week. 

Compare that to the cost of an M&S lunch  of a chicken, chilli and mango salsa sandwich with coconut pieces and orange juice, which comes up to £5, or £25 per working week and the price disparity is obvious. 

And while you're losing the pounds from your purse, you may well be piling them elsewhere as a lot of these options are high calorie foods. 

Pret's 482-calorie sandwich also loses out when pitted against M&S's, which contains a mere 295 calories.  

Marks & Spencer's £5 a day lunch includes a sandwich, coconut pieces and freshly squeezed orange juice

Bargain: Asda's chicken and wholewheat pasta, savoury popcorn and cranberry drink costs just £3.69

Hot food counters like the ones at Whole Foods Market are also guilty of making us overspend. 

The pay-by-the pound pricing structure can be misleading and there are times when you can end up paying as much as £20 or a salad or hot lunch just because you weren't paying attention to what you were putting in your takeaway bowl. 

Supermarkets may not have the most exotic of choices but their prices are far more appealing.

The M&S Piri Piri Chicken and Coleslaw Sandwich costs just £2.50. Bored of sandwiches? Splash out an extra 50p and go for the Tikka Chicken & Rice Salad.

Snacks include the 50p Sour Cream & Chilli Lentil Curls, Reduced Fat Hummus and Carrot, and Cracking Coconut, both £1 or the £1.20 fruit selection of melon, pineapple and grapes.

Add a bottle of Orange Juice (£1.50) or Revitalise Sparkling Apple & Blueberry (£1) and your meal will cost you exactly £5.

Looking to make bigger lunchtime saving? Try Asda’s super salads. Lunch on either Baby Potato and Free Range Egg Salad, (153cal); Spiced Chicken and Wholewheat Pasta (305cal) or Spiced Chicken and Mango Salad (164cal), all from their Good and Balanced range and you won’t be spending any more than £2.

And as you’ve only spent £2 on salad, you can afford a snack of either walnuts and dates, crinkle cut crisps, popcorn or lentil chips, all which cost £1. Add a drink (69p) and you’ll still be hard pushed to spend more than £4 here. 

Tesco's £3 meal deal options include tuna and cucumber sandwiches on malted bread (left) and the 2 for £2 sushi combinations such as their veggie taster (right)

Tesco is another great option. There are a number of healthy combinations within the supermarke'ts £3 sandwich meal deal which means you get a choice of any sandwich or salad, snack and drink for £3.

It also does a two-for-£2 sushi offer: choose any two products, any combination, for £2.

Healthy options include the Tesco Healthy Living Chicken and Stuffing Sandwich, Healthy Living Smoked Ham and Chutney Salad and the No Mayo Chicken Salad with Bacon. 

For snacks there is a range of fruits and vegetables such as apples, grapes and celery to choose from. The £3 price also includes fruit juices, smoothies and still or sparkling water. 

The any 2 for £2 sushi combo includes items from the supermarket's sushi selection such as sweet chilli smoked salmon, tuna teriyaki taster and hoisin duck taster. 

Even Waitrose, with its reputation for pricey products, offers inexpensive and healthy lunch options.

Both the paprika chicken and vegetable rice salad with beetroot dip with cauliflower combination and the feta and lemon quinoa salad and minted pea dip with carrot and cucumber option cost less than £5.
