A thrillseeker has travelled the globe capturing the world's most exciting rollercoasters with his camera.

With no big rides in Austria, Wolfgang Payer, 57, took time out of his office job in Vienna to travel the world on an amusement park tour.

And the Austrian photographer found the perfect screaming subjects when he captured adrenaline-junkies riding the enormous 'Goliath,' at the Six Flags Over Georgia theme park in the US.

Favourite shot: Wolfgang snapped this unusual viewpoint of the Goliath ride at Six Flags, Georgia 

Standing 200ft tall, this monumental ride reaches speeds of 70mph and cost $11.8m (£20m) to build in 2005.

Wolfgang says the shot of this ride is his favourite because of the innovative angle he captured.

He said: 'It is not a normal view, it wasn't easy to take this photo and actually only a few people get the idea to take a photo like this.

Six Flags Over Texas has its own adrenaline-fuelled ride - the Titan hypercoaster which has a 255ft drop

'When taking a photo, I look for a view which has never existed before.'

While in America, Wolfgang visited Hershey Park in Pennsylvania. Taken on a glorious summers day, Wolfgang captured a stunning shot of the park's tallest and fastest ride, 'Skyrush.'

He also made trips to amusement parks in Texas and New England. In a bid to seek more thrills, Wolfgang travelled to the UK and sampled some of the biggest rides Thorpe Park has to offer.

He managed to catch thrill-seekers while they were on speed-coaster, 'Stealth', and the park's latest edition, 'The Swarm.'

Italian lady: The iSpeed, at Mirabilandia, Italy stands at a colossal 180ft tall and has two inversions

Spending time in Italy, Wolfgang captured the iSpeed at Mirabilandia amusement park - which hits speeds of 62mph in just 2.2 seconds.

The Austrian usually spends three to four hours in the theme parks taking around 30 pictures of each ride with his Nikon D800.

Before taking pictures tries out the huge roller coasters, adding: 'Normally, at first I ride on the coaster one or two times and then I take the photos.

'After the ride, I have more of an idea of how to get the right photos.

'With a ride on a roller coaster I really know the machine and I can see the whole track.'

He added: 'You must find your inspiration to take photos, whether they are of models, landscapes or roller coasters.'

Riders hurtle along the swirling tracks of Six Flags New England's scariest ride

BUzzing success: The Swarm at Thorpe Park has been a favourite of thrillseekers since it opened in 2012 

His love of roller coasters dates back to 1998. He said: 'It was my first time visiting a really great amusement park because I went with my family to Florida to show my kids Disneyland.

'It was the first time I got to see a big roller coaster - in Austria there are no big coasters. I was fascinated by these big rides, my two kids also enjoyed the roller coasters at the time.'

Now Wolfgang makes visiting amusement parks with his family a regular thing, he said: 'We always go on vacation in other countries, we travel to Spain for two weeks and spend about three days at the amusement parks.'
