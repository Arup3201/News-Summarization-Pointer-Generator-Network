Border guards in Texas are on high alert after two child immigrants were confirmed to have swine flu following their interception trying to cross the border from Mexico.

The minors were diagnosed with the highly-contagious H1N1 virus on Friday at two separate military detention facilities in Brownsville, Texas.

Both centres, at Brownsville and nearby Fort Brown, were today on lockdown as border officials scrambled to contain a potential outbreak, placing some 120 people who came in contact with the juveniles in isolation.

It comes days after Texas officials renewed 
demands that the federal government take further steps to secure the 
border as waves of illegal immigrants are turning military bases into 
makeshift settlements.

Medical teams are stationed inside the detention centers to screen for lice, scabies and chicken pox but not everyone gets medical clearance.

National Border Patrol Council Vice President Chris Cabrera said: 'If someone is released and they are symptomatic, it could spread rapidly.'

President Barack Obama is under mounting pressure to stem the rising tide of South and Central American migrants flocking across the border in search of better lives.

Last week, House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul (R-TX) claimed American military bases are turning into 'refugee camps', adding: 'I never thought I'd see this in the United States of America.'

Texas Governor Rick Perry, also a Republican, demanded ‘Secure this border, Mr. President’ in a separate speech.

McCaul
 also claimed the President’s series of executive actions have made it 
easier for minors to stay in the country and put them at even greater 
risk for harm.

Swine flu is a relatively new strain of influenza that was responsible for a flu pandemic from 2009 to 2010.

The
 virus was first detected in Mexico in April 2009, but spread quickly 
from country to country due to it being a new strain. As a result very 
few people had a natural resistance to the virus.

It is also known as the H1N1 influenza, denoting the strain of the virus.

People suffering swine flu typically complain of a fever or high temperature - over 38C.Other
 symptoms include aching muscles, sore throat or a dry cough - symptoms 
that are very similar to other types of seasonal flu.

For those in high-risk groups experts advise getting vaccinated against swine flu.

Those
 considered 'at risk' are pregnant women, people suffering chronic, 
long-term lung, heart, kidney or liver disease, people suffering 
conditions including cystic fibrosis and Parkinson's and diabetes.

Many top government officials, including House Minority leader

‘These 
children are often subjected to beatings, starvation, sexual assault and
 are at risk of being trafficked,’ said McCaul, according to Fox News.

‘Allowing them to remain here will only encourage the next group of individuals to undertake this very dangerous,’ Perry added.

Both
 men’s remarks came as many border towns have seen an influx of people 
illegally crossing the U.S. – Mexico border only to end up in temporary 
prisons and makeshift settlements before they are processed and either 
deported or sent elsewhere.

A
 significant number of these immigrants are now unaccompanied minors who
 end up in lockups like the widely-publicized one at a former bus 
station in McAllen, or are found dead in the desert – like a young girl 
was this week.

Those
 that do survive the perilous journey are then taken to a Houston 
airport and flown around the country to various shelters, according to Buzzfeed.

The
 hub, in a staging area away from the public at the Bush 
Intercontinental Airport… is intended to reduce the amount of time it 
takes to transfer custody of the minors to the Office of Refugee 
Resettlement, which runs the shelters, the site reported.

Those
 children, mainly from destitute Central American countries, started 
being taken to military bases across the country last month, according 
to Buzzfeed.

Some of those bases include Fort Sill, in Oklahoma, and Lackland Air Force Base, in texas, according to Fox News.

Nancy Pelosi (D- CA), have visited the porous border carved by the Rio Grande River.

President 
Obama earlier this week sought $2billion in emergency aid to help open 
more detention centers across the country to provide ‘basic humanitarian
 needs,’ according to White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest.

‘That's
 why the president has asked for additional resources from Congress to 
open up detention facilities across the country, where these individuals
 can be housed in humane conditions’

Governor Perry still blasted the feds after announcing a $1.3 million-per-week program to ferry state agents to the border.

Those agents are expected to bolster border patrol efforts, said Perry, according to Fox.

The
 Governor also called for Washington to pay back the $500million Texas 
has spent on border security the past 10 years, Fox reported.

‘We have been fulfilling a federal responsibility,’ said Perry, whose own bid to run for president during the 2012 election fizzled out before the Republican convention.

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) also called for Obama to take a tougher stance on minors crossing the border without their parents ‘who are already in the United States illegally,’ he told Fox.

He claimed the parents ‘had a role in smuggling the minors into the United States.’

More than 52,000 unaccompanied minors have been snagged by the border patrol since October, and the number is steadily rising.
