Censored material, including drunkenness and sexual innuendo, removed from published stories by F Scott Fitzgerald has been restored in a new edition of the author's work.

Passages in the writer's fourth collection of short stores, Taps at Reveille, were altered by editors before they were published during the late 1920s and early 1930s.

The work, originally published in the Saturday Evening Post, had references to anti-semitic slurs, made by unpleasant characters, drug use and profanities removed in an effort not to offend readers.

Now, Cambridge University Press has restored the text to its original version following a study of drafts which feature revisions by Fitzgerald.

According to The Guardian, the original published version of the story Two Wrongs edited out the use of a racial slur by one of the characters, while a scene which describes another character undressing was also altered so they were fully clothed.

The latest uncensored versions of the stories were published by Cambridge University Press this week.

The publisher's website states: 'Fitzgerald assembled the collection in a time of debt and personal difficulty, working with texts that had, in many cases, been censored by the Saturday Evening Post and other magazines.

'Using evidence from the drafts that bear Fitzgerald's final revisions, this edition presents for the first time restored texts of the stories, with censored material reinstated and sexual innuendo as Fitzgerald originally intended.'

Fitzgerald is widely acclaimed as one of the greatest American writers of the 20th century.

A film version of one of his best-known works, The Great Gatsby, starring Leonardo DiCaprio was released last year, taking in more than $50m in its opening weekend.

Although it is now regarded as one of the greatest American novels ever written, the book only sold 20,000 copies on its 1925 release, netting Fitzgerald a meagre $2,000. It only became a hit following Fitzgerald's death in 1940.

The Great Gatsby tells the story of mysterious American millionaire Jay Gatsby, played by DiCaprio in the Â£105 million film, in the prosperous Roaring Twenties era.

The story is told by Nick Carroway (Tobey Maguire in the movie), a neighbour of Gatsby, and revolves around Gatsby's love for Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan).

It is noted for its accurate portrayal of the decadence and social upheaval of 1920s America.
