Police are searching for a 25-year-old doctor who mysteriously vanished on her way to work on Monday morning.

Dr Fehintola Omidele, who goes by the nickname FT, was last seen at dinner with her family in Houston, Texas, on Sunday night.

When she did not come in to work at the Children's Memorial Hermann Hospital the next day, her family found her cell phone in her room and her car was missing.

Missing: Dr Fehintola Omidele, or 'FT', has not been seen since family dinner in Houston, Texas, on Sunday

Dr Omidele enjoyed a glittering academic career, graduating from high school at 16 with a grade point average of 4.3, before graduating from college at the age of 20.

After four days, family and friends have found no trace of KT or her 2011 grey Toyota Camry with the license plate BZ2L971.

'She's extremely responsible, so her not showing up for work and it's been four or five days, is not like her at all,' family friend Dr Omonele Nwokolo told KHOU.

Another friend, A'Lys Lawrence, told MailOnline: 'We are broken hearted and doing all that we can to bring her back home safely.'

Police say there is no evidence of foul play as they continue to investigate the disappearance.

Dr Omidele, who is fluent in Yoruba and English, is described in missing posters as 5'5", weighing 120 pounds.

Appeal: Friends issued this poster  to trace her car which is also missing. Her cell phone was found at home

Star doctor: FT graduated from high school at 16 with a 4.3 grade point average and graduated college at 20

Hailing from Nigeria, her family moved to New Orleans when she was eight, then to Katy, Texas, when she was 12.

According to the Houston Chronicle, she graduated high school with a 4.3 grade point average - out of a possible 5.0 - at the age of 16.

She was 20 when she enrolled in graduate medical school after majoring in biology and child development at the University of Texas.

'Extremely responsible': Friends claim FT's disappearance earlier this week is completely out of character

In a profile done on Dr Omidele in April, she told the Chronicle: 'I've always loved children. I'm drawn to them. Personally, I consider myself a kid at heart. In college, I worked at the child development center.'

She graduated in May, when she started her three-year pediatrics placement at the Children's Memorial Hermann Hospital in Houston.

One day, she said, she hopes to work for the French non-governmental organization Doctors Without Borders.
