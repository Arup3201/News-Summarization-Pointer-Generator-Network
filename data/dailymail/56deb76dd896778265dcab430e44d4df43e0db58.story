Celtic have completed a double transfer swoop as Manchester City’s Belgian centre-half Jason Denayer joined Aleksandar Tonev in signing in time to play in next week’s Champions League qualifier with Maribor.

As anticipated, Aston Villa’s 24-year-old Bulgarian winger Tonev completed his loan move to Parkhead after completing the formalities on Monday afternoon. 

Celtic boss Ronny Deila then succeeded in persuading the highly-rated 19-year-old Denayer to continue his development in Glasgow in a deal thought to be similar to Tonev’s.

Tonev admitted he was thrilled to finally join the club under  Deila’s management, having been sold on the switch by former Celt Stiliyan Petrov.

‘Joining Celtic is unbelievable and I feel really good about it,’ Tonev told the Celtic website. ‘I’m delighted to have joined the club and I can’t wait to meet up with my new team-mates and start playing for Celtic.

‘I already knew all about Celtic. Everybody in Bulgaria knows Celtic. I spoke to Stiliyan Petrov yesterday and he was very happy for me. He wished me good luck and I hope I can do as well for Celtic as Stiliyan did.

Double swoop: Celtic hope Aleksandar Tonev and Denayer can help them qualify for the Champions League 

Tonev and Denayer will go into the squad to face Maribor in the Champions League qualifiers and become Deila’s third and fourth signings after Craig Gordon and Jo Inge Berget.

‘Aleksandar’s a very quick player and he has two good feet which he can shoot with,’ added Deila.

‘He scored a lot of goals during his time at Lech Poznan and I think he can help bring the club forward with his qualities. We can also make him better.’

New arrival: Tonev arrives in Glasgow on Monday to finalise his loan move to the  Scottish champions
