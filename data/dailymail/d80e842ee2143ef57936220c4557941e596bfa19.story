Brown Panther turned Sunday's Irish St Leger into a procession courtesy of an astute ride from Richard Kingscote, handing owner Michael Owen and trainer Tom Dascombe their first ever Group One winner in the process.

Kingscote was at his sharpest tactically aboard the six-year-old, narrowly beaten in the prestigious staying event two years ago, as he allowed his charge to track runaway pacesetter Eye Of The Storm, a move which saw the two front-runners establish a 10-length lead turning for home.

Once Eye Of The Storm cracked in the straight, Kingscote sauntered past aboard the admirable stayer and merely needed to keep his mount up to his work to score by six-and-a-half lengths from favourite Leading Light, who snatched second from Encke in a bunch finish for the places. A delighted Kingscote was thrilled to have repaid the faith shown to him by connections.

He said: 'I've been riding for Tom (Dascombe) for a good few years and he's been very supportive of me for a good while so I am delighted to ride a high-profile winner for him.

'The plan was to get our lad in behind a couple of rivals and get him to drop his head, but he jumped very well and they went a nice gallop so I was pleased where I was.

'We know our lad doesn't stop when he gets to the front so I wasn't worried about being there so far out. I am very pleased for the horse and for the connections and the yard as he deserves a big one.'
