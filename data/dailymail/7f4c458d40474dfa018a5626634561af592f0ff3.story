Three-dimensional models of a 'priority area' in the Indian Ocean have been revealed as the search for MH370 ramps up.

In the images huge mountains, deep trenches and dormant volcanoes are seen strewn across the search area - but there's no sign of the plane yet. 

The search for the plane is set to resume later this month, and mapping the ocean floor is essential to ensure the survival of underwater equipment that will be used. 

Three-dimensional models of the area MH370 is thought to have gone missing in the Indian Ocean have been revealed. They will be used to direct deep-sea equipment when the search for the plane resumes later this month. The maps reveal various features include large ridges and deep trenches (shown)

Malaysia Airlines flight 370 disappeared over the Indian Ocean on 8 March with 239 people on board, and no sign of the plane has been found since then.

It has been widely reported that better maps of Mars exist than this portion of the sea floor where the plane is thought to be located, so the new maps will be key in the hunt for the plane.

The models show the designated MH370 search area, which includes the seabed around an area known as Broken Ridge.

8 March 12:21am

Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 departs from Kuala Lumpur, south west Malaysia, due to land in Beijing at 6.30am the same day. On board are 227 passengers and 12 crew.

1.20am

Eight villagers report seeing lights in the sky and hearing noise in the Marang area of north east Malaysia.

1.30am

Air traffic control makes its last recorded sighting of air traffic control. The plane is last seen on civilian radar above the waters where the South China Sea meets the Gulf of Thailand.

1.45am

Several sightings of the planet are reported, including a businessman in Kora Bharu and a bus driver in Penaruk.

2.15am

Military radar detects what could be the jetliner 200 miles north west of Penang Island in the Northern Malacca Strait. 

The primary search area - dubbed the ‘priority area' - is  an arc 23,000 square miles (60,000 square kilometres) in size, roughly the size of Croatia, 1,120 miles (1,800km) off the Australian coast.

This area formed when two geological plates separated 20 to 100 million ago creating mountains, volcanoes and trenches.

Seamounts - remnants of submarine volcanoes - are also present in the area. 

These large geological structures are typical of two such spreading plates.

Structures include rugged ridges that reach heights of 985ft (300 metres) and trenches that are up to 4,590ft (1,400 metres) deep.

At the end of this month the search will resume to try to find any sign of MH370 in this area.

This will include using a deep-sea search vehicle attached to a boat by an armoured cable 6.2-miles (10km) long.

Knowing where ridges and volcanoes lie is vital to ensure the equipment does not crash into an unseen object while underwater.

The vehicle will use sonar to scan the ocean floor for anything that might resemble MH370, and it will also be able to detect the presence of aviation fuel.

Knowing the location of the features is essential to steer deep-sea vehicles around them. Later this month equipment will be lowered on a cable to search the seabed using sonar and other techniques to try and find MH370. The maps  reveal raised areas (shown) that will need to be dodged by underwater vehicles

The primary search area - dubbed the ‘priority’ area - is an arc 23,000 square miles (60,000 square kilometres) in size, 1,120 miles (1,800km) off the Australian coast.

‘The recently acquired high-resolution bathymetry data [the study of ocean floors] has revealed many of these seabed features for the first time,’ the Australian Transport Safety Bureau said in a statement.

‘It is also revealing finer-scale seabed features that were not visible in the previous low-resolution, satellite-derived bathymetry data.’

The new 3D models were maid using high resolution survey data, including satellite gravity measurements and some ocean passage soundings.

Identification of the features will assist in navigation during the underwater search phase.

The estimated location of MH370 in this area was derived from a series of brief pings - electronic ‘hellos’ - from the plane to a satellite before it disappeared.

And it's hoped some sign of the plane will finally be found when the search starts again.

Malaysia Airlines flight 370 disappeared without a trace in the early hours of 8 March while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. The Boeing 777 with the registration number 9M-MRO is seen here on a previous flight over Poland on 5 February 2014 before its final flight
