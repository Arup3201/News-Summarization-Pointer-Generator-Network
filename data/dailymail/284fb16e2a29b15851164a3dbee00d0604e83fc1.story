Linda Locking, 36, stole £5,000 from Nutcombe Plumbing in the few months she worked there

A bookkeeper who stole thousands of pounds from a plumbing firm was caught after labelling a payment of £2,000 into her account 'Happy Christmas'. 

Linda Locking, 36, had only been working for  family-run plumbing business Nutcombe Plumbing in Harston, Cambridge, for a few months when she started helping herself to cash.

The company had even loaned the mother-of-three £750 for car repairs after she claimed she had money trouble.

Despite that Locking, from Cambridge, dishonestly transferred 22 small amounts of money into her personal account. 

She was caught in December 2013 when she transferred £2,000 with the festive message.

It was then discovered that she had stolen more than £5,000 from the firm in the short time she had been employed.

The company spotted that and called police and Locking was charged with theft.

She admitted theft when she appeared at Cambridge Magistrates' Court and was given an 18-week suspended sentence.

Magistrates also ordered her to carry out 240 hours unpaid work and repay £5,000 to the company.

Her solicitor told the court she was 'remorseful' and the crime had had a huge impact on her life.
