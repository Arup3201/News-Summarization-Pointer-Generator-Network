Habit: Mother-of-five Smith smoked 40 cannabis joints a day to relieve pain from an accident, she claimed

A crash victim awarded £130,000 in compensation has blown the lot - on cannabis, a court heard.

Sally Smith, 39, won the six-figure pay-out after she was left wheelchair-bound when she was mown down by a car on a pedestrian crossing in 2003.

But the mum-of-five was so overcome with pain she developed a 40-joint-a-day marijuana dependence.

In July Smith was caught supplying £1,000 of the Class B drug to a friend and hauled before the courts.

During sentencing, Maidstone Crown Court heard Smith’s money had literally gone up in smoke because she used it to fund her drug habit.

On Monday Judge Charles Byers told her: ‘Both of you must understand that whatever people say cannabis is a dangerous drug.

‘It can cause the most enormous problems for the people who take it.’

Ben Irwin, mitigating, told the court his client has suffered ‘post traumatic stress disorder’ as a result of her accident.

He said: ‘She turned to smoking cannabis as a way of dealing with those demons and making her day to day life all the more tolerable.

‘She couldn’t cope with having that much money and it all went far too soon.

‘It wasn’t a desire to make money or a profit. It was about making sure the pain wasn’t so acute.’

Smith, from Tonbridge Wells, Kent, admitted possessing cannabis with intent to supply, producing cannabis and supplying cannabis.

Verdict: Smith was sentenced to eight months jail suspended for two years by Maidstone Crown Court

The friend to whom she supplied the drug, Paul Fletcher, 34, from, Hildenborough, Kent, also admitted possession with intent to supply.

Both were sentenced to eight months jail suspended for two years and ordered to each pay £250 court costs.

Smith was also given a three-month curfew from 7pm to 3am while father-of-one Fletcher was ordered to carry out 150 hours unpaid work, supervision for 18 months and attend a Thinking Skills programme.
