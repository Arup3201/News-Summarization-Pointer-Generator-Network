Chelsea club secretary David Barnard said manager Jose Mourinho had declared himself 'happy' with their Champions League draw.

Mourinho's side were handed the simplest task of the English sides, as they were put in a group with German side Schalke, Portuguese club Sporting Lisbon and Maribor of Slovenia.

And the Chelsea boss was quick to tell his colleague that he was satisfied with the prospect. 

Happy: Jose Mourinho said that Chelsea's draw was better than any of the other English sides got

Back again: Chelsea beat Schalke twice last season at the same stage in the Champions League

Barnard said: 'He texted me to say he was happy. Would you rather be in the groups with the other English clubs? You have got to be happy with that.'

Horst Heldt, Schalke sporting director insisted however they would be out for revenge.

He said: 'Our aim is the same as in recent years: We want to get through the group stage. We still have a score to settle with Chelsea, as we lost both matches to them last season.'

Liverpool were given a rather tougher draw pitted against holders Real Madrid.

Madrid may be a daunting prospect for Brendan Rodgers' side, but Liverpool beat the Spanish giants 5-0 on aggregate in 2009 including a 4-0 hammering at Anfield.

Liverpool chief executive Ian Ayre said the the club were thrilled at the draw - and can cope without Luis Suarez following his move to Barcelona.

Ayre, speaking after the draw in Monaco, said: 'You would never not want Luis - Luis is a fantastic player and made a fantastic contribution to Liverpool but so did a lot of other people.

Leading the line: Liverpool chief executive Ian Ayre says Daniel Sturridge can replace Luis Suarez's goals

Difficult draw: Last time Liverpool played Real was in 2009, but both teams have changed a lot since then

'A lot of the goals that Daniel Sturridge scored were amazingly important for us last season and he will still be there banging them in and we are seeing goals from all over the park last season.

'So I think we are in great shape and will keep developing and improving.'

He added: 'If you look at Liverpool as a football club this is our competition, we've won it five times and to play someone who has won it 10 times makes it extra special.'

Arsenal's draw sees them face a difficult trip to Turkey to face Galatasaray, as well as playing 2013 finalists Borussia Dortmund.

Still there: Club captain Steven Gerrard scored twice as Liverpool beat Madrid 4-0 four years ago

Arsenal's club secretary David Miles said: 'We know Borussia Dortmund well of course, and we are looking forward to it and hopefully can progress through this group - with the pre-requisite being to aim to finish top of the group.

'There were some tough teams in pot four we should have got and fortunately we steered clear of those.'

Re-match: Robert Lewandowski, now departed from Dortmund, scored twice at the Emirates last season

Achievable: Arsenal hit back in Germany and managed to get out of their group in second place last year

Manchester City were given the toughest task of the English teams, facing German giants Bayern Munich and Serie A runners up Roma. 

Barcelona and Paris St Germain should dominate Group F, where they were drawn with Ajax and APOEL from Cyprus, while last season's beaten finalists Atletico Madrid are in Group A with Juventus, Olympiacos and Malmo.

Benfica, Zenit St Petersburg, Bayer Leverkusen and Monaco make up Group C while in Group H Porto, Shakhtar Donetsk, Athletic Bilbao and Belarus side BATE Borisov will battle it out.
