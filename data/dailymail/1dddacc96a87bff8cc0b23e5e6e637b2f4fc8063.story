Max Chilton has every confidence he will be retained by Marussia for a third consecutive season.

Chilton started the campaign relatively strongly, claiming the best results of his Formula One career by finishing 13th in the season-opening race in Australia and again in Bahrain.

In Monaco, however, team-mate Jules Bianchi stole Chilton's thunder as the Frenchman scored Marussia's first points from their four and a half years in F1 with ninth place in Monaco.

Since then Chilton has struggled for form and results, but the 23-year-old from Reigate in Surrey sees no reason why Marussia would not retain him for 2015.

'I naturally want to stay with the team,' said Chilton. 'Like a lot of these things they filter down from the top, and there are a lot of rumours with regard to the top of the grid, with people moving around and you don't really know where you stand until then.

'I won't focus on that until later on in the year, but I'm confident I'll be here next year. I've had good races this year.

'I started off fairly strong, and okay the last few have not been particularly great, but I feel we've got to the bottom of that. Overall I've been consistent and had good results.'

Chilton may yet be thanking Bianchi for that result in Monaco as the young Briton would like to believe it could play a key role in his own future.

Those two points mean Marussia lie ninth in the constructors' title race ahead of both Sauber and Caterham.

If Marussia can hold on to that position the financial rewards would be considerable, which in turn may mean Chilton not having to find the cash to fund his seat.

'Marussia have a good future, especially if we hold off Sauber for ninth. That would really build up momentum,' added Chilton.

'That would be a big help to the team financially if we could do that as it would help us develop the car for next year.

'If the team gets this ninth then we might not need to worry about that (his financial situation). That's just me really thinking of the bigger picture. 'I've not properly looked into it, but I'd like to think I could continue to help the team develop over the next couple of years.'
