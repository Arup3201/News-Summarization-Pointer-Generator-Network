Max the overweight Jack Russell has managed to lose a fifth of his body weight - after joining a pet fitness club.

The six-year-old, who once weighed a staggering two stone and had a reputation for sticking his nose in sweets jars, also managed to lose 10cm off his waist.  

His owner Emma Harrison said her mother Sylvia, 80, had enjoyed taking Max for walks since he was a puppy, but after she developed painful arthritis, she increasingly struggled to control her dog's weight.

The six-year-old Jack Russell once weighed a staggering two stone after Ms Harrison's 80-year-old mother struggled to take him for regular walks

Now, thanks to a slimming club for pets run by animal charity PDSA, Max has shed the extra weight.

Ms Harrison, 30, from Hull, said: 'He's been known to put his head in a sweets jar and eat them - wrappers included - so we've had to be really careful to keep food away from him!' 

When they realised Max was piling on the pounds, her family stepped in to help give him the number of walks he needed to stay fit.

And Max was also put on a strictly controlled six-month diet and banned from having extra treats and biscuits to help him slim down.

Ms Harrison added: 'We 're absolutely thrilled at how well Max has done.

'He's a Jack Russell so needs a lot more exercise than most breeds but my mum's age meant she just couldn't give him enough on her own.

'Now we work together as a family to make sure he gets at least six long walks a week.

'My mum has a lot of grandchildren, so we are all pitching in to do our bit. You can notice a big difference in Max since he lost the weight.

'He's got loads more energy and has a spring in his step, he just seems a lot happier in himself.

'The pet fit club has given us the inspiration to help him lose even more weight.'

Max's achievement meant he was named runner-up in the PDSA Pet Slimmer of the Year competition. 

PDSA nurse Helen Darnell, who helped oversee Max's diet, said: 'Max looks absolutely amazing since shedding the pounds in pet fit club.

'Emma and Sylvia stuck to the plan completely and it's wonderful to see him so full of life again.

'He has just a little way to go to reach his ideal weight now.' 

PDSA vet Elaine Pendlebury, who helped to judge the contest said it was important owners kept their pets fit and healthy.

She said: 'Max's achievement is an amazing success story - proving that it's never too late to make a positive difference to a pet's health and lifestyle.

'All of our pet fit club slimmers will have an improved quality of life as a result of their weight loss, and will probably have an increased life expectancy too.'
