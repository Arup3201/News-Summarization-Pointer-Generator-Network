In a bid to lure new customers, Foxtel are set to slash its prices in November, while existing customers will be rewarded with extra benefits, free of charge.

In a big incentive, the pay TV operator will slash the price of its entry level and cable subscriptions to half, set to cost new customers just $25 per month.

Plans have also been unveiled to give existing customers better bang for their buck, with a range of extra channels and free content.

FOXTEL have announced big changes to its pricing structure in a bid to lure new customers with a $25 a month plan. Existing customers will also reap the benefits of extra channels and more content, all free of charge

Foxtel CEO Richard Freudenstein says the new pricing structure will maximise the availability of its services for new subscribers.

'We know that many Australians are aware of the amazing content and technology that Foxtel offers but feel that the price is not right for their budget', he said.

'A $25 entry point that gives access to over 40 popular channels in our Entertainment Pack will cause millions of people to have another look at Foxtel'.

The Entertainment Pack will include many of the most popular channel brands such as FOX8, Lifestyle, TVHiTS, ARENA, MTV, National Geographic, Universal, TCM and more as well as access to Foxtel’s iQ set top boxes.

The key bonuses for existing customers will include some pay per view movies at no extra cost for those who take the premium movies and drama access and for those who don't have it access to the premium drama channel, Showcase - the home of HBO.

'From securing the best programming possible to providing innovative services like Foxtel Go and Look Back, we’re serious about going the extra mile', said Mr Freudenstein.

In addition, Foxtel has announced plans to strengthen its High-Definition offering across all of its premium content packs by adding nine new HD channels including sports, movies and drama bringing Foxtel’s total HD channel count to 36.

As part of its new pricing structure, they'll be a revamp of premium tiers which include offering the Sports Pack for just $25 per month.

There'll also be new technology, the new set top box, the iQ3, is currently in its final field trials.

'iQ3 will be the most advanced set-top box available and will provide a revolutionary new way to enjoy the best that Foxtel has to offer', Mr Freudenstein said.

'The changes we are announcing today constitute a defining moment in Australian media'.

'With amazing bonuses for current customers, new pricing designed to make Foxtel more accessible and with iQ3 and Triple-Play just around the corner, the time has never been better to take advantage of this golden age of television through Foxtel'.

The changes come as Foxtel face a host of other new competitors.

The free to air TV industry launched its Freeview Plus service this week, which allow viewers to watch catch-up services from free-to-air channels using TV and an internet connection.

While Nine Entertainment Co and Fairfax Media also recently confirmed a $100 million joint venture partnership on the new subscription video on-demand service, StreamCo. 

Foxtel has reported that it directly employs around 2,500 people and is subscribed to 2.6 million homes.
