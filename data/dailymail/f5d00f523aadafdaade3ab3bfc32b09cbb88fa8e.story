Ryman Premier League side Maidstone claimed a replay after a 0-0 draw at League Two outfit Stevenage.

The visitors came mightily close to causing a shock at the Recreation Ground, with the home side having veteran keeper Chris Day to thank after Frannie Collin was denied by the feet of the 39-year-old.

The hosts could have won it late on themselves after  Chris Beardsley's header came off the outside of the post.

Elsewhere, 2008 winners Portsmouth were held 2-2 by Hampshire rivals Aldershot at Fratton Park.

Danny Hollands' goal nine minutes from time saved Pompey's blushes against the Conference side, after the visitors fought back admirably from going 1-0 down to lead 2-1 through Jordan Roberts and Mark Molesley.

Norton United, of the Evo-Stik South, saw their cup run come to an end as they were beaten 4-0 at home by Conference high-flyers Gateshead, with Rob Ramshaw grabbing a hat-trick.

Evo-Stik Premier side Blyth Spartans are in the second round, however, after a 4-1 home win over Altrincham.
