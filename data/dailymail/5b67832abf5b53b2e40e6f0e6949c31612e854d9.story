Claims that Silvio Berlusconi slept with an underage girl at a ‘bunga bunga’ party have been backed up by one of his guests.

Brazilian model Michelle Conceicao said the allegation that the former Italian prime minister slept with belly dancer Karima El Mahroug – known as ‘Ruby’ – when she was 17 was ‘true’.

Asked if she saw Berlusconi ‘pay and go to bed with underage girls’, she replied: ‘Certainly that’s true – I was there.’

Trial: Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is accused to sleeping with underage prostitute Karima El Mahroug at one of his infamous 'bunga bunga' parties 

Miss Conceicao told Italian magazine 
Espresso that television presenter Barbara Guerra had slipped away with 
Berlusconi into his bedroom at the end of a party in April 2010.

She added: ‘Ruby and I were in the bedroom next door and we were laughing.

‘We said that Barbara was faking it, 
then after a while we couldn’t hear anything. Then Barbara came out and 
said that he had fallen asleep. At that point Ruby slipped inside and 
closed the door.

‘She managed to wake up the sleeping prime minister. She did it all herself – he is of a certain age.’

Miss Conceicao’s claims came as Berlusconi’s trial for allegedly having sex with Mahroug resumed in Milan.

In Italy, the age of consent is 14, 
but paying for sex with a woman below the age of 18 is seen as underage 
prostitution and punishable by up to three years in prison. Prosecutors 
claim that Berlusconi, 75, gave a string of women cash, jewellery and 
cars to attend his parties.

Miss Conceicao added: ‘All the girls 
who were paid went with him. Those that stayed the night got 5,000 euros
or maybe more, the others who didn’t stay got at the most 1,000 or 
2,000 euros.'

She also claimed that two ‘very 
famous’ names were among Berlusconi’s favourite women and she was 
willing to testify about them when she gives evidence at the trial later
this month.

Miss Conceicao said she had been due 
to testify last month but was unable to do so because she was in Brazil,
adding that Berlusconi had called her and made a veiled threat about 
her evidence.

She said: ‘Berlusconi called me and he
spoke with me. He said, “When there is a storm at sea you never throw 
anybody overboard.” I think it was his way of telling me not to tell the
truth. I’m scared something will happen to me.’

Her claims were dismissed by Berlusconi’s lawyers as ‘completely unfounded’.

Star witnesses:  Footballer Christiano Ronaldo and actor George Clooney are among dozens of witnesses due to give evidence at the trial

A witness at the trial yesterday said women invited to bunga bunga parties called the former premier ‘Betty’.

Another guest Barbara Faggioli said 
they used the codename in case their telephones were being wiretapped. 
The word ‘shoes’ was used for money.

Wearing a diamond necklace that 
Berlusconi had given her for her birthday, Miss Faggioli said: 
‘Berlusconi always gave me help as if he were my father’, adding that he
paid the rent on her Milan apartment and gave her money if she needed 
it.

‘It’s just the way he is, he is very gentlemanly,’ she said, denying the gifts and money were in exchange for sex.

Outside court, Miss Faggioli said Miss Conceicao’s claims were ‘all b******s’.

Berlusconi has 
insisted that nothing untoward happened at his parties and that they 
were merely convivial evenings of 'fine food and music' and Miss El 
Mahroug, who is also known as Ruby the Heartstealer, also says nothing 
happened between them.

Prosecutors say that at the time of the parties Miss El Mahroug was only 17 years old and although in Italy the age of consent is 14 but paying for sex with a woman below the age of 18 is seen as under age prostitution and it is punishable by up to three years in prison.

The trial has been going on for a year and has already heard from several witnesses who described how women would dress as nuns and police officers before stripping off while performing seductive pole dances for Berlusconi and two of his cronies at the parties which took place between 2009 and 2010.

Berlusconi is also accused of abuse of office, with prosecutors claiming he had Karima freed from police custody when she was arrested for theft by wrongly telling officers she was related to the then Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak.

The trial continues and is not expected to finish until the autumn with dozens of witnesses due to testify including George Clooney and Cristiano Ronaldo.
