Anyone who clapped eyes on two-year-old Chris Pickbourne in his blue overalls and hard hat in 1988 probably had a pretty shrewd guess at his future job plans.

And, sure enough, the toddler who was the face of a Nissan recruitment campaign 25 years ago is now one of the Sunderland car maker’s maintenance men.

Mr Pickbourne owes his mother for pointing the way after she put him forward for the 1988 photo-shoot.

Chris Pickbourne, 28, was billed as 'Britain's most successful two-year-old' when he was used to promote Nissan's graduate scheme

Wendy Pickbourne said: ‘When I took 
Chris to the shoot there were a few volunteers, but he was the only one 
who would sit still for the photographer.’

Mr
Pickbourne, who lives in nearby Washington, said: ‘The factory was 
under construction when I was born and it is amazing to think how the 
company has grown during my lifetime.’

He recently joined Nissan as a member of the maintenance team at the company's Sunderland plant - and bosses are using him to promote the latest wave of jobs at the factory.

The plant in the North-East is the UK's largest car factory with more than 500,000 models rolling off the production line last year.

It's a far cry from when Mr Pickbourne first represented Nissan in 1988, when just 28,797 cars - all Bluebird saloon - left the factory. 

Staff numbers have now rocketed from 1,100 to more than 6,000 as the firm manufactures four different models.

Dressed in blue overalls and with a hard hat perched on his head, the young Mr Pickbourne appeared in the adverts while waving the Union flag

Mr Pickbourne, from Washington, said: 'The factory was under construction when I was born and it is amazing to think how the company has grown during my lifetime.

'I've always had an interest in Nissan's success and knowing what an exciting period it was for the company, the job security and the benefits offered, it was a great time to join the Maintenance department.

'It's a very challenging and rewarding environment and we're all very much looking forward to seeing the new models in production.'

Incredibly, the contact name on the 1987 flyers, Greg Penn, is now the HR director at the plant, which is looking to hire a variety of engineers and technicians.

His mother said: 'I'm a very proud mother and have had many happy years at Nissan, so I was delighted when he returned home to join me at the plant.'

More than one in three cars built in the UK is a Nissan, which has been Britain's biggest car producer since 1998. 

The Japanese car maker builds its Qashqai, Nissan Note, Juke, Juke NISMO and electric LEAF models in Sunderland.

HR boss Greg Penn added: 'Chris is one of more than 600 extra staff we have hired over the past two years to support record production levels and new model preparations.

'We are actively recruiting for experienced professional people across our Engineering and Maintenance departments, so I'd encourage anyone interested in Nissan to visit our recruitment website, and find out why more than one in three British cars is now built in Sunderland.'
