AARON CRUDEN: 

Still considered Dan Carter’s understudy but with 36 All Black caps to his name, this world-class fly half would walk into most international sides.

Aaron Cruden has won 36 caps for the All Blacks and has starred for his country in recent seasons 

Cruden has been named to start at fly-half against England on Twickenham on Saturday 

JULIAN SAVEA: 

With 29 tries in 30 Tests the man they call ‘The Bus’ has more touchdowns than the England team put together.

Savea, in action against South Africa in October, is one of the world's most lethal finishers 

BRODIE RETALLICK  

At 23, 6ft 8in and with 33 caps to his name, looks set for a career to rival the very best All Black locks. Superb athlete.

SAM WHITELOCK  

 Senior second row partner is not as big as Retallick but equally athletic. An outstanding footballer with a hard edge.

CONRAD SMITH 

Without the sort of physique to strike fear into opponents, Smith makes up for it with superb awareness, vision, passing ability and world-class defence.
