What colour is snow?

At first, it seems like an easy answer. Anyone who has seen snow will know it is white, the reason being because it reflects almost all visible light incident upon it.

But if you’ve ever dug a deep hole in snow and looked down, you will have noticed that sometimes it can actually appear blue - and sometimes even red, in other circumstances - but why?

Dreaming of a white Christmas? Don't dig too deep into snow, or you might start to notice a bluish tint. This is due to more and more of the ice crystals in the snow reflecting blue light, and absorbing other types, although of course in this image the effect is amplified by the shadows as well

As mentioned, snow appears white because it reflects most visible light that strikes it. Anything that does this means you see the whole spectrum of visible light, which looks white.

Snowflakes are understood to be unique - at a molecular level at least.

But scientists have revealed that each and every one of them can in fact be sorted into 35 general shapes, which in turn tell experts how they formed.

The shapes, which include column crystals, irregular snow particles and plane crystals - which make ‘traditional’ hexagonal snowflakes - vary according to temperature and humidity.

Bournemouth-based chemistry teacher Andy Brunning, created an infographic based on recent research to show the different shapes, which he published on his blog, Compound Interest.

It shows 39 types of ‘solid precipitation’ or snow, including the 35 types of snowflakes and their names, which can be further divided into 121 subtypes.

Simpler snowflake shapes such as germ of ice crystals, are more common at low humidities, while more complex flakes, such as plane crystals are formed in areas of high humidity. 

Other objects appear different colours because they absorb certain wavelengths of visible light but reflect others - a green apple, for instance, reflects only mostly the green wavelength.

But, as reported by JSTOR, when snow is deep enough it can actually appear blue.

The reason for this is due to ice crystals in the snow, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC)

‘As light waves travel into the snow or ice, the ice grains scatter a large amount of light,’ the NSIDC explains.

While most of the light is reflected, there is a very small tendency towards more red light being absorbed than blue.

When you see just the surface of a pack of snow, the scattering of the blue light is almost completely impossible to notice.

But if you look into a significant amount of snow, about 3.3ft (one metre) or so, more photons emerge towards the blue end of the spectrum than the red end.

‘For instance, if you were to poke a hole in the snow and look down into the hole, you may see a bluish colour,’ said the NSIDC. 

While most of the light that is incident upon snow and ice is reflected, there is a very small tendency towards more red light being absorbed than blue, giving a slight bluish tint in deep snow and ice, such as this image from South Georgia Island in Antarctica

‘As light waves travel into the snow or ice, the ice grains scatter a large amount of light,’ the National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC) explains. Shown is a slight bluish tint in a melting glacier in East Greeland

When snow appears red, though, it is for an entirely different reason.

This effect is due to cold-loving, fresh-water algae known as Chlamydomonas nivalis that contain a bright red pigment.

Also known as ‘watermelon snow’, it is ‘most common during the summertime in high alpine areas as well as along coastal polar regions’.

Interestingly, C. nivalis cells actually appear green under a microscope. The reason they appear pink in snow to our eyes is due to a biochemical called beta-carotene.

It protects the algae’s chlorophyll from the sun’s rays, but in the process gives them a red or pinkish hue, rather than green.

Be careful not to eat watermelon snow, though - it can act as a laxative.

Red snow can also be caused by iron-rich seawater, such as Blood Falls in Antarctica’s Taylor Glacier, shown, where the water leaks from an ancient reservoir under the glacier. The iron oxidises when it comes into contact with the atmosphere, turning red 

Last year, meanwhile, a Washington photographer  spent two month living in a remote base in Antarctica to reveal how the area can be surprisingly colourful.

Gaston Lacombe captured incredible images showing the bright pinks, greens and reds of the area - caused by everything from penguin poo to massive blooms of algae. 

Mr Lacombe told MailOnline he was invited to the remote base by the Government of Argentina as its artist in residence.

The Canadian photographer now based in Washington, D.C. spent two months at Esperanza Base, a permanent research station on Antarctica’s Trinity Peninsula.

The red colour doesnt always come from algae, however. Adelie penguins transiting to and from the sea shore colour the surface of the snow with whatever substance they drag with their feet. The pink colour here is from penguin poo, since they eat mostly krill, a small type of shrimp

Snow might normally appear white - but it can also appear red and blue

In the Alps in Europe, snow can appear red due to a type of algae

Chlamydomonas nivalis has a pigment that makes it appear red

But a blue colour can also be caused by light scattering in ice crystals

@highlight

In deep snow, more and more light is scattered

This can give snow a bluish tint, rather the regular white that is seen
