Business owners and motorists today hit out at developers of a new skyscraper which they blame for starting fires and causing damage by reflecting the sun's rays.

The half-finished 37-storey tower in central London has been dubbed the ‘Walkie Scorchie’ due to its distinctive shape and apparent ability to bounce heat from the sun onto buildings in the next street.

Angry business owners in Eastcheap say the £200 million project has blistered paintwork, caused tiles to smash and singe fabric. A motorist has also said the intense heat melted part of his Jaguar.

One shopkeeper said the glare caused his doormat to start smoking and damaged a lemon, another said it blistered paint - and one journalist even managed to fry an egg with the startlingly bright rays.

Unbelievable: An egg is fried in intense sunlight reflected from the Walkie-Talkie building, in Eastcheap in the City of London, where sun light reflected from the building melted part of a Jaguar car

Further damage: The seat of a bicycle parked near the building was also allegedly singed by the blinding light

How does it happen? This graphic shows how the concave shape of the skyscraper means a large amount of sunlight is reflected into a small area

Scorched: Men stand in the doorway of a barbers shop, which has a burn mark on the carpet in London. It was reported that the carpet was set alight from sunlight reflected by the Walkie Talkie tower

Even the fruit suffered: A damaged lemon is seen in the window of a barbers shop in the City of London

Developers called the problem with 
the building at 20 Fenchurch Street ‘a phenomenon’ and said they 
are ‘looking into the matter as a priority’. Cyclists have also reported scorched bicycle seats.

Ali
 Akay, of Re Style barber's, said the position of the sun at a certain 
time of the day caused a searing bolt of sunlight to start a small fire 
and burn a hole in his company doormat.

He
 said: ‘We were working and just saw the smoke coming out of the carpet.
 We tried to cut the fire down, there were customers in at the time and 
they were obviously not happy.

‘Customers are not going to come in if there is a fire in the front of the door.’

Blinding: The phenomenon takes place in the afternoon on bright days in the City of London

Up close: A camera man films broken slates outside a cafe in London. It was reported the tiles had shattered from sunlight reflected by the Walkie Talkie tower

Problems: Tiles melted and a doormat caught fire after being hit by the rays reflected from the Walkie Talkie

Big issue: The singed carpet in the barber's shop in the City of London can be seen here, circled

Due to it's concave design, sunlight is reflected into a very localised point in the early afternoon

Mr Akay, 22, said they had spoken to the managers of 20 Fenchurch Street to find a solution.

He
 said: ‘It is getting really serious. This is a health and safety issue.
 They should have looked into this before they built it.’

Colleague Ayca Juma, 29, said: ‘It's the Walkie Scorchie. That's what caused this.’

Next door at the Viet Cafe, Diana Pham, 25, said they had suffered similar problems.

‘Yesterday
 it was very hot so there was a concentration of light here,' she said. 'We thought 
something was burning in the restaurant but it wasn't, we searched 
everywhere.

'Every bit of plastic on the left hand side and everything on the dashboard has melted, including a bottle of Lucozade that looks like it has been baked'

Eddie Cannon, van driver

‘Then a customer came in and showed us. A
 tile suddenly broke, the paint has bobbled too. This is a problem...it 
can be dangerous for people. But I don't know what they (the developers)
 can do about it.’

Motorists
 have reported problems, too. Local businessman Martin Lindsay told City
 A.M. his high-spec Jaguar XJ, parked on Eastcheap on Thursday 
afternoon, had warped panels along one side.

Mystery: The building developers are investigating the bizarre phenomenon

'Burning plastic smell': The car was said to have been in the ray for just an hour but the panels were buckled

The wing mirror and badge had also melted from the heat of the reflection, he claimed.

'The phenomenon is caused by the current elevation of the sun in the sky'

Van
 driver Eddie Cannon, a heating and air conditioning engineer, told the 
newspaper: ‘The van looks a total mess.

'Every bit of plastic on the 
left hand side and everything on the dashboard has melted, including a 
bottle of Lucozade that looks like it has been baked.’

A
 joint statement from developers Land Securities and Canary Wharf said: 
‘The phenomenon is caused by the current elevation of the sun in the 
sky.

‘It currently lasts 
for approximately two hours per day, with initial modelling suggesting 
that it will be present for approximately two-to-three weeks.

‘As
 responsible developers we are making every effort to keep local 
businesses informed and we have communicated with them regularly since 
the issue first appeared.

‘While
 we investigate the situation further we have liaised with the City of 
London to suspend three parking bays in the area which may be affected.

‘In
 addition, we are consulting with local businesses and the City to 
address the issue in the short-term, while also evaluating longer-term 
solutions to ensure the issue cannot recur in future.’
