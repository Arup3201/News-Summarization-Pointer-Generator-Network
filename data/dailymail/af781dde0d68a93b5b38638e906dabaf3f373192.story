A suspected iPhone thief in Colorado accidentally outed herself when she posted selfies on the Facebook account of her alleged victim. 

Rawley Bingham claims the suspect, who has been pictured but not identified, took her iPhone while she was at a bar in Denver last week. 

The 23-year-old didn't expect to see the phone again - until she logged on to her Facebook account three days after the theft.

After alleged victim Rawley Bingham logged on to her account, she recognized the woman from the bar

When Bingham checked her account, she found 13 selfies of the alleged thief.

Bingham thinks the suspect goes by Lil Momma 

The settings on Bingham's cellphone send her photographs to a private Facebook folder, 9NEWS reported.

She recognized the woman from the bar and it is believed she goes by 'Lil Momma', Fox 31 reported. 

Bingham said: 'It actually becomes a lot more plausible for me to get it back when she starts posting selfies. 

'There were just a lot of selfies of her around downtown Denver.

''She had a great Sunday.'

Denver police have gotten involved and Bingham is hopeful that Lil Momma will just return the phone.

The suspect has been using the phone to respond to texts from Bingham's friends.

Metro Denver Crime Stoppers is offering a $2,000 reward for any information leading to Lil Momma. 

Anyone with information is asked to call (720) 913-7867.
