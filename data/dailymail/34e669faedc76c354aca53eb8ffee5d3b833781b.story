Honoured: James Chaney will receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom posthumously

Three civil rights workers who were killed by Ku Klux Klansmen in 1964 are going to be posthumously awarded the highest civilian honour of the US - the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

The murders of Michael Schwerner, James Chaney and Andrew Goodman  in Neshoba County, Mississippi, saw the FBI launch a massive investigation dubbed 'Mississippi Burning'.

The activists are among 19 people, including Stevie Wonder and Meryl Streep, who will be awarded the nation's highest civilian honor by President Barack Obama at the White House today.

Despite this high honour, some relatives of the trio are uneasy about the award, saying it takes focus off all the victims of racism and those who were killed during the African-American civil rights movement in the 60s and today.

 'There were not just three men who were part of a struggle. There were not just three men who were killed,' Rita Schwerner Bender, widow of Michael Schwerner said.

'You know, the struggle in this country probably started with the first revolt on a slave ship, and it continues now.'

Chaney's sister, the Rev. Julia Chaney Moss, of Willingboro, New Jersey, said the award should be for all of those killed during the civil rights movement.

'It's really about all of those families,' she said. 'It's really about the history of the pain of the African-American experience in Mississippi.' 

Michael Schwerner, James Chaney and Andrew Goodman met working on black voter registration and had travelled to Neshoba County on June 21, 1964, to investigate the burning of a black church.  

Civil rights workers Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman were killed alongside colleague James Chaney in June 1964, which then became known as the 'Mississippi Burning' murders

Legacy: The national outrage that followed the murders saw president Lyndon B Johnson pass the Civil Rights Act 1964 and the Voting Rights Act 1965

Critique: Rev. Julia Chaney-Moss of Willingboro, N.J., sister of slain civil rights worker James Chaney, said the residential Medal of Freedom should be for all of those killed during the civil rights movement

As they left the church, a deputy stopped their station wagon, cited Chaney for speeding and took the three to the Neshoba County jail. 

The deputy released them late that night, and the men were ambushed by awaiting Klansmen who chased them to an isolated country road and shot them to death.

In 1967, an all-white jury in Meridian convicted seven men on federal civil rights charges tied to the conspiracy to kill Schwerner, Chaney and Goodman. 

The state reopened an investigation decades later, and on June 21, 2005 - exactly 41 years after the slayings - a jury made up of whites and blacks in Neshoba County convicted Edgar Ray Killen of manslaughter. He remains in state prison. 

Their deaths sparked a national outrage and the attention the investigation brought to the civil rights movement saw president Lyndon B Johnson pass the Civil Rights Act 1964 and the Voting Rights Act 1965 

On screen: The murders inspired the 1988 film Mississippi Burning with Willem Defoe

Honored: Stevie Wonder and Meryl Streep are also set to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom

The story of the murders and the ensuing FBI investigation was made into a film, called Mississippi Burning, in 1988 starring Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe.

Today, the 'Mississippi burning trio'  are among a distinguished group receiving a Presidential Medal of Freedom, reserved for individuals who have made 'meritorious contributions' to U.S. security, world peace or cultural endeavors.

The list of recipients this year includes includes actress Meryl Streep, Ethel Kennedy, widow of the late Sen. Robert Kennedy, singer-songwriter Stevie Wonder and Rep. John Dingell, a Michigan Democrat and the longest-serving member of Congress. Dingell is retiring at the end of the year.

Others being recognized at a White House ceremony Monday are composer Stephen Sondheim, NBC journalist Tom Brokaw and author Isabel Allende.
