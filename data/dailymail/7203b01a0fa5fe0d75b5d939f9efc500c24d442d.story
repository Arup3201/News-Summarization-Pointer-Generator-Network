This weekend saw Britain enjoy temperatures higher than Greece and it seems the high street is all set for the warmer the weather.

Primark has today unveiled its SS14 collection and it's full of enough vibrant colours and tropical prints to take you through to summer in style.

The cut-price store says its latest range aims to celebrate global cultures and exotic carnivals so expect bright florals, colour clashes and tassel-embellished kaftans.

It's Summer! Primark has unveiled its SS14 high Summer collection on the back of the glorious weather

The womenswear range fuses vivid African and Caribbean prints, which can be seen on cut-out bralets and culottes.

There's plenty of casual tees emblazoned with animal prints, galloping horses and tiger's faces and boucle jackets with clashing colours - tipped to be big this season.

Prints charming: Bold prints, clashing colours and animal prints are key to the collection this season (left: top £5, trouser £12) and (right: top £5, culotte, £10)

All things bright and beautiful:  The womenswear range fuses vivid African and Caribbean prints (skirt, £12, shorts, £4, sandals £4)

Help at hand: Primark's swimwear comes in a 50s silhouette with push up bras and high-waisted briefs (bikini top, £8, bikini bottom, £4)

Urban chic: The sports luxe trend shows no sign of abating if Primark's collection is anything to go by (top, £6, skirt, £6, visor, £1.50)

The collection is given a festival feel with beading, tassels, feathers and raffia, jazzing up flatforms, box bags and knotted headbands.

Swimwear is key to the collection and comes in a 50s silhouette with push up bras and high-waisted briefs, which the brand says aim to enhance an hourglass figure.

The menswear, meanwhile, takes inspiration from athleticism and 80's artwork this summer.

Boho vibes: With cool tropical prints and raffia totes, the range is perfect for summer holidays and festivals alike (dress, £13, bag, £9, earrings, £1)

Cover up: There's plenty of flattering swimsuits and boucle jackets with clashing colours - tipped to be big this season (jacket, £15, swimsuit, £13, earrings, £1, rings from £1.50)

Tattoo-style Hula girls, hand drawn hummingbirds and lollipop prints feature on T-shirts, swimming trunks and caps.

The collection has a young, fun feel with tie-dye vests and block colour swimshorts, fun floral snapbacks, neon flip flops and even leopard print trainers.

Let's hope the sun stays out.

Loud and proud: The menswear collection takes inspiration from athleticism and 80's artwork this summer (left: top, £8, shorts, £4.50, cap, £4, sandals, £2) and (right:  top £7, shorts £4.50, cap, £4)
