Members of a Kansas community shattered by the double tragedy of two beloved high school classmates who committed suicide just two days apart gathered by the hundreds on Tuesday for a vigil meant both to celebrate the girls' lives and to urge others not to make that same choice.

Soccer star at Olathe Northwest High Ciara Webb, 16, was found dead in her home Friday afternoon. Her teammate Cady Housh jumped in front of a freight train two days later.

At Tuesday night's vigil, the girls' dear friends shared bittersweet tales of their teen hijinks in the glow of candlelight inside Grace United Methodist Church.

Of course, the tragedy hit closest to home for the girls' family. Nevertheless, one of their grieving fathers took the opportunity to send a message to the friends Ciara and Cady left behind.

Mourning: Hundreds gathered in an Olathe, Kansas church Tuesday night to mourn the deaths of two high school girls, both on the local high school's soccer team, who killed themselves two days apart over the weekend

A father's plea: Friends of Cady Housh and Ciara Webb shared fond memories of the girls as they held candles at the mournful vigil. A father of one of the victims pleaded with the kids to discuss their feelings with one another to try and prevent yet another tragedy

Share your feelings with one another and help prevent this from ever happening again, he said, because even he even he couldn't see the signs of suicide in his daughter.

Echoing the broken father's sentiment was Dr. Nanette Roberts of Grace United who counseled that anger can be a part of healing.

'They didn’t let us love them into better health, they didn’t let us love them into staying alive, they didn’t let us love them into staying alive.

'They didn’t let us love them into know how important they were and that leaves you feeling empty and yeah a little bit angry,' she told WDAF. 

Students at Olathe Northwest High who didn't already know of Ciara's tragedy over the weekend were horrified to hear the news Monday morning.

During the following school period, officials dropped another bomb: Cady, a junior like Ciara, had thrown herself in front of a train two days after learning of her friend suicide.

On Sunday, presumably just before her decision to step in front of a barreling locomotive in Lenexa, Kansas around 8pm, Cady posted what would be her final message to the world.

Sad: Cady Housh tweeted this ominous message on Sunday, the very day she decided she, too, would end her own life

Tragedy struck at Olathe Northwest High after, within just two periods at the beginning of their day, students and teachers learned they'd lost two girls, both juniors, to suicide

'Worst weekend of my f***ing life,' the teen wrote.

She would then retweet a message of hope that a friend had posted, one that urged the mourning 'to hold on.' However, the emotional young woman would not be able to do so herself. 

Over the weekend, Webb's close friends and teammates on the Ravens girl's soccer team had posted notes of grief, confusion and terrible sadness on social media.

Many also included photos of Ciara. The 16-year-old blonde--called CiCi by friends--looked like a perfectly well-adjusted teen.

Friends began including a hashtag, #ripCW, with their prayers, remembrances and photos.

Unfortunately, they'd soon need yet another somber hashtag.

'You dreaded going into the hallways,' ONW high student Katie MacDonald told the Kansas City Star. 'Class was fine, because I'm a freshman. But when you went into the hallways, that's when people that knew (the first victim) were there.'

Reports from inside say that some teachers were even seen to burst into tears once the news broke. 

On Sunday, by which time most if not all of those who were close with Ciara had learned of her death, Cady Housh was seen by a freight train engineer in Lenexa.

She was standing on the tracks in the locomotive's path. The engineer summoned authorities but could not stop the train.

What could have caused it? Friends of the girls expressed their grief on social media, on the same sites that still show the beautiful, smiling faces of Cady and Ciara (left and right)

Mourning: Friends were left stunned by the one-two-punch of the girls' suicides. The hashtag #ripCW cropped up on Twitter and Instagram soon after Ciara's suicide, only to be followed all too soon after Housh's death by the tag #ripCH

Lenexa police and first responders were called to the scene in the Kansas City suburb shortly after 8 p.m. Sunday. The girl was taken to a hospital and later died.

Soon, the Olathe Northwest students and other friends of the girls in the area were adding #ripCH to their wrenching tweets and Instagram photos.

Also blonde and with an undeniably charming smile, photos of Cady carry no hint of the deeply gruesome act she'd soon find herself driven to. 

'This amazing family will forever be missing two very important pieces, we love you guys, rest easy babies #ripCW #ripCH,' tweeted a friend of the girls' Haley Kuehn, who would later write, 'This is a living hell.

Dustin Edde, who identifies himself as Ciara's brother on Facebook, posted a heartbreaking message to the late teen on Facebook Saturday.

'Love you so much Cici, wish I could find a time machine if anyone has one let me use it please. RIP little sister,' he wrote.

Dear ONW Families:

I wanted to follow up with all of our families related to the tragic information we have had to share with you regarding the suicides of two students here at ONW. First I want to share with you how the events unfolded here at ONW this morning, the action that we took immediately to support our students and staff, and most importantly , I want to leave you with a strong request that you have a very heartfelt conversation with your son or daughter this evening .

As you are aware, we opened ONW yesterday to any students in need of support or just needing a place to go and be with friends after learning on Friday evening of the death of Ciara Webb. This morning we met with our staff at 7:30 to brief them on the incident from Friday. They were provided with resources for talking with and supporting students. Qualified counselors, social workers, school psychologists, school resource officers from ONW, other schools/community resources were available for students upon their request or if any adult noticed that a student was struggling. Each student was told in their first hour about the death of Ciara Webb.

Devastated parents: Ciara Webb's father Jason Webb (left) posted a touching photo of himself to Facebook after his daughter's suicide, making it his profile picture

After the ONW administration was notified of the death of Cady Housh, we asked that staff share the new information with their second hour class. After that announcement many additional students sought out the support and counsel from our crisis team of qualified personnel. Students were told that they could call their parents. Many parents called to check their students out of school. Care was taken to ensure any student that was leaving campus had a parent with them or they were in direct contact with their parents. Many students have remained here at school, with classes continuing as planned and with staff and resources available to them throughout the day. We are in constant communication with those on the band trip in New York. Please know care and support is being provided to them as well!

Here is my request for all parents for this afternoon or evening - please have a heartfelt conversation with your student about these tragedies and specifically about suicide. Have this conversation with your son or daughter tonight – you know them best. Ask them how they are feeling, be non-judgmental, and avoid any gossip related to details of the deaths or causes. Keep communication open and maintain high supervision and knowledge of their whereabouts. It will be vital that you are closely monitoring your student's social media accounts for messages being sent and received.

Include in your conversations tonight these messages:

- Suicide is a horrible decision and is not an option.

- There is nothing they could have done or said to change the outcome of these tragic deaths.

- Emphasize that suicide is not the way to handle problems, no matter how big or how painful.

- Help is available. Talk to a parent, a teacher, any trusted adult.

- If they know of a friend that is struggling, let an adult know as soon as possible.

ONW is here to support our students and our families in any way needed. Please do not hesitate to reach out to any of the administrators or staff. School will be in session tomorrow. ONW is a safe place for them to be – surrounded and supported by their teachers and friends that care deeply for each of them. Counseling and support will continue to be available for any students in need throughout the week.

Again, please do not hesitate to call or email with any questions or concerns. We are one Raven Family!

Gwen Poss, Principal
