A woman today denied trying to kill a newborn baby girl by hurling her down a 50ft rubbish chute.

Iraqi-born Jaymin Abdulrahman, 24, pleaded not guilty to the attempted murder of the six-day-old baby, who was found by police inside a bin by a block of flats.

The baby plunged 50ft from the fifth floor of a tower block in Wolverhampton, West Midlands, down a rubbish chute which led to a refuse collection area where she was found shortly after being reported missing.

Officers arrested Abdulrahman shortly after the stricken baby was discovered and rushed her to Birmingham Children's Hospital at 6.30pm on September 8 last year.

Abdulrahman also faced a charged of doing an act intended to pervert the course of justice at Wolverhampton Crown Court.

During the 40-minute hearing, the court heard the second charge had been brought after Abdulrahman told police the child had been abducted.

Wearing a black dress, black headscarf and grey cardigan, she spoke through a Kurdish interpreter to plead not guilty to both counts.

Judge John Warner remanded Abdulrahman into custody and fixed her trial date for June this year.

He said: 'Your trial will take place at Birmingham on June 5.

'You will be brought to this court for further and hopefully final directions on February 22. You will remain in custody.'

A 32-year-old man also arrested in connection with the incident remains on police bail.

The baby is still recovering from her injuries.
