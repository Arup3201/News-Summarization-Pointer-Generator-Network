A 12-stone lion cub has sparked panic on a Russian train after its owner let it loose.

The nine-month-old female was only allowed on the sleeper because it had been registered for travel by it owner as a 'domestic cat'.

But when Lyudmila Kosovskaya, 24, let the beast out of its cage she lost control of it. The cub then ran amok in the carriages scaring passengers and staff.

One woman was clawed when she tried to calm it down but only made it more angry. Kosovskaya then managed to shut it in her sleeper car and call for help.

When the train supervisor arrived he could hear the animal's growl from behind the door.

'It did not sound like a cat's meow', said one account.

Staff alerted the next station at Yekaterinburg, 870 miles east of Moscow,   
and police were awaiting the train's arrival with veterinarians and 
local circus staff.

The long distance train was travelling from Moscow to Novy Urengoy in northern Siberia. It's believed Kosovshaya was en route to the city of Surgut.

The nine-month-old cat, worth around Â£40,000, was being taken from the Russian capital to the city of Surgut by Kosovskaya.

It is believed she was being transported as a 'model', to use in a promotion at a local mall.

Police in Yekaterinburg said the owner 'could not cope with the situation and it was necessary to urgently isolate the animal which was running wild'.

A spokesman told the Siberian Times: 'The lion cub had first been kept in a cage but then the woman accompanying it for some reason let the animal out.

'When the animal, which was being transported without a muzzle, started behaving wildly, the woman couldn't control it. She shut it in her sleeper car and asked the train staff for help.'

An eyewitnesses said: 'When the coupe was opened, we saw the lioness. She was not aggressive, but rather frightened with what happened. There was a cage, but the lioness was sitting on the bottom bunk.'

Yekaterinburg Circus spokeswoman Natalia Kazantseva said: 'Our trainer was on the scene. He helped to take the animal away from the train.

'How could such a big animal be transported in such conditions? Nobody put her to sleep, she was given just a sedative medicine.

'She adamantly refused to leave the coupe. It was obvious that the lioness had been tamed, as she made contact with pleasure and ate meat from the hands.'

The owner fled the train and is now being sought by police. It is believed the lion was later put down.
