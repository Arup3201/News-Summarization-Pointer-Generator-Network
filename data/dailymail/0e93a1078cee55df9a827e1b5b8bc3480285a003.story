Police confiscated plastic guns from a gang of 'toy soldiers' after they stormed into a Nando's restaurant.

Shocked staff and diners watched as the group of men, painted green and wearing makeshift army uniforms, burst into Nando's in Chester and started doing military-style drills.

Officers were called to the chicken restaurant on Bridge Street after hearing that the stag party were 'storming in and out' of shops and restaurants causing alarm to the public.

The men, who had all dressed up as the plastic miniature figurine soldiers, were spoken to by the officers and had their plastic weapons confiscated.

The incident comes less than a month after counter terrorism officers met organisations, including Chester Zoo and Chester Cathedral, to urge them to step up security after the national terror threat level was raised to severe.

Richard Ingham, manager at Nando's, said he was surprised to see the men come into the restaurant and start rolling around on the floor. 

'We didn't know if they were street performers,' he said describing the moment the men, smothered in green paint, walked in on Saturday, December 20.

Police received reports that the group, wearing makeshift army uniforms, were playing toy soldiers in shops and restaurants around Cheshire (pictured)

'They all lay down on the floor and started scrambling and doing all kinds of things.'

One witness said: 'I saw them 'storm' Costa... they ran in shouting 'clear the area'.

'It was obvious to me that they were a stag party but I could see some people looked utterly confused.'

The stunt divided opinion on social media. One member of the public commented: 'In bad taste considering the Sydney siege this week', while another said 'some people clearly have no sense of humour' adding 'it brightened up our day anyway'.

A mother-of-four said the men had waved and even posed for a photo with her kids while she was stuck in traffic, saying 'all my children loved them' while others said they should have been arrested and one said it was 'lucky they hadn't been shot'.

Cheshire Constabulary posted a statement on its official Facebook page, saying: 'Cheshire officers have been called to a report of males dressed as soldiers with guns 'storming' in and out of shops in Chester city centre.

Cheshire Police, who posted that the group were causing 'concern to the public on Twitter, have spoken to the men and confiscated the fake guns

'Whilst it was fairly apparent this was a case of ill-considered revelry the actions of those involved who were on a stag party night out have caused quite some concern to members of the public.

'Given the current terror climate, those involved really should have known better. The males have had the toy weapons confiscated and been appropriately advised.

'We want people to enjoy nights out, especially at this time of year, but we also want people to feel safe and to act responsibly.' 

Chester police sergeant Tony McGreary added: 'Officers were deployed in a proportionate manner to reassure the public and to speak to the men to prevent further concern.

'The males have had the toy weapons confiscated and been appropriately advised.

'We want people to enjoy nights out, but also act responsibly and take into consideration how your actions could have an effect on others.'
