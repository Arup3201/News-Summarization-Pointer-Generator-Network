Caroline Kennedy's daughter is spending this summer interning at the New York Times.

Kennedy's daughter Tatiana Schlossberg - the granddaughter of President Kennedy - most recently covered the University of Connecticut's $1.3million settlement with five women who claimed their sexual assault cases were mishandled by the school, the Washington Post notes.

A spokesman told the Post that Schlossberg 'was hired like any other intern.'

Intern: Tatiana Schlossberg, daughter of Caroline Kennedy and granddaughter of President Kennedy, is spending this summer as a New York Times intern

As the newspaper points out, Schlosberg has worked at both the Yale Herald and the Bergen Record.

Her work at the Yale Herald mainly focused on first-person arts and entertainment stories.

Some of those pieces included the titles 'The Internet and me: a self-love story for this century' and 'iHate iPhone apps, but iReally love David Hockney.'

Many of Schlossberg's stories at the Bergen Record, meanwhile, focused on local crime and police work.

The prestigious New York Times internships last ten weeks and pay 'about $1,000 a week,' the newspaper says.

The New York Times did not immediately return a request for comment.
