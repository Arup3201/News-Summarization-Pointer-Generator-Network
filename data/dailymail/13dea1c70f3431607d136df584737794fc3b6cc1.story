Cometh the New Year, cometh the rankings which lay the foundation for the first tranche of big fights in 2013.

The principal corner-stone is the pound-for-pound rating of the best boxers in the world. Rarely has a year turned around so many diverse opinions as to who are the ten finest of them all.

The most intense argument centres upon Manny Pacquiao and his rightful place in that listing.

Still got it: Manny Pacquiao returned to winning ways with a comprehensive win over Brandon Rios

The Americans were quickest to write off the PacMan, who would also be president of the Philippines, when his robbery by Tim Bradley was followed by his carelessness in getting knocked cold by Juan Manuel Marquez.

Yet even in the US they admit, however reluctantly, that Pacquiao remains the only authentic challenger to Floyd Mayweather as the master of his generation.

Pacquiao reminded them of that by overwhelming tough young gun Brandon Rios in his comeback.

Yet still The Ring magazine, the bible of boxing in America, and Boxing News, the gospel of the game in this country, relegate the PacMan to the bottom half of their top ten.

Not this column.

There is confusion, also, as to how best to acknowledge the talents of two other outstanding boxers.

Wladimir Klitschko’s long reign as the multiple heavyweight champion has taken the edge off boxing’s marquee division. 

Guillermo Rigondeaux, arguably the most gifted amateur of all time, has turned pro late after leaving his native Cuba. Thus he has continued in the classical style which he does best and has quickly become the dominant figure at super-bantamweight. Even so he is criticised for failing to excite the crowds – and more importantly the TV moguls – by descending into brawls against technically inferior opponents.

Just as it is no fault of Klitschko’s that they can find no-one to beat him, so Rigondeaux deserves admiration for his mastery of the noble art of self-defence.

Yet he is begrudged recognition for skills similar to those of Floyd Mayweather, who is everyone’s No 1.

Andre Ward is also more esoteric than exciting but he, like Mr Money, is up there in all the rankings.

But then he too is American.

Skills: Guillermo Rigondeaux is technically an excellent boxer - like heavyweight king Wladimir Klitschko (R)

Untouchable: Floyd Mayweather cemented his position as the best in the world against Saul Alvarez

The lower ratings are complicated by the inactivity of the brilliant Sergio Martinez because of injury and the ease with which Marquez was outpointed by Bradley.

And what do you do with Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez after his whipping by Mayweather? In my view he is edged out by Adonis Stevenson, the Haitian-Canadian Superman who has knocked out Chad Dawson, Tavoris Cloud, our own Tony Bellew and Darnell Boone – all  four in the space of the calendar year just ending.

Boxing News deserve plaudits for doffing the cap of tenth place to the prize-ring’s mini maestro.

Nicaraguan
 Roman Gonzalez, the world light-flyweight champion, has beaten all his 
37 professional opponents, stopping 31 of them with a dynamite left, yet
 is still only 26.

Brit basher: Adonis Stevenson knocked out Tony Bellew to retain his light-heavyweight world title

1)    Floyd Mayweather2)    Manny Pacquiao3)    Andre Ward4)    Timothy Bradley5)    Wladimir Klitschko6)    Guillermo Rigondeaux7)    Adonis Stevenson8)    Sergio Martinez9)    Juan Manuel Marquez10)   Carl Froch

However, in common with The Ring, I reserve that tenth position for Britain’s only entrant in the pound-for-pound hierarchy. 

Carl Froch -  still love him or not after the controversy of his ninth round stoppage of George Groves -  remains the standard bearer for boxing in this country and a world champion who has taken on all the top super-middleweights on the planet.

But what price Amir Khan if he were to pull off the mother and father of all upsets against the imperial Floyd?

For comparison, here are The Ring and Boxing News rankings:

Ring: 1) Mayweather; 2 Ward; 3) Bradley; 4) W Klitschko; 5) Martinez; 6) Marquez; 7) Pacquiao; 8} Rigondeauz; 9) Alvarez; 10) Froch.

Boxing News: 1) Mayweather; 2) Ward; 3) Bradley; 4) Marquez; 5) Martinez; 6) Pacquiao; 7) Rigondeaux; 8) Nonito Donaire, 9) W Klitschko; 10) Gonzalez.**Next week – the British top ten. (Both lists will then be updated at least monthly).

Premature? Carl Froch stopped George Groves in their world title fight despite the challenger's protests

There is much sympathy for Britain’s Martin Murray who, after all, will not be making his third bid for a version of the world middleweight title in Monte Carlo on February 1.

Yet in truth the time has come for the brake to be applied to the WBA’s nonsense of elevating their champions to ‘Super’ status, thereby allowing other contenders  to dispute so-called ‘regular’ world titles.

This has been a cynical device for the WBA  to collect more sanctioning fees. It devalues the status of world champion, which is already diluted by the existence of so many alphabet bodies.

Chance gone: Martin Murray (right) will not now challenge for the WBA world middleweight title in Monte Carelo

After widespread criticism, not least from this quarter, the WBA have backed away from awarding such spurious celebrity promotion to Gennady Golovkin, whose fight on that bill in the south of France against Osumanu Adama will now be a defence of his straightforward world title.

Murray will still feature on the undercard, defending his ‘interim’ belt against Australia’s lightly-rated Jarrod Fletcher.

Murray does deserve another title shot, after pushing both Felix Sturm and Sergio Martinez desperately close in his two previous challenges.

Hopefully that will come.

But for the moment he finds himself back down a lengthening middleweight queue with, at its head,  Golovkin the Kazakh knock-out merchant who stopped Murray’s fellow British contender, Matthew Macklin, in the old year.

Not so Super: Gennady Golovkin will now defend his regular WBA middleweight title in February

The boxing community will be deeply sensitive to the head injuries sustained by seven-time world champion racing driver Michael Schumacher.

The hard old game drastically modernised its medical procedures after Michael Watson suffered severe brain trauma at the climax of his world title fight with Chris Eubank in 1991.

A failure to supply oxygen in the ring, as soon as he collapsed, became the focal point of Watson’s subsequent claim for compensation.

However, the speed with which Watson was transferred to hospital enabled renowned neuro-surgeon Peter Hamlyn to operate only 28 minutes after the event.

Catalyst for change: Michael Watson suffered severe brain trauma after his fight with Chris Eubank in 1991

Warning: Boxing has since overhauled its medical procedures after Watson was not given oxygen immediatley

That alerted boxing to what Hamlyn labelled ‘the golden hour.’  He stressed that surgery within those precious 60 minutes saved Watson’s life and made possible his long, painful but eventually miraculous recovery from total  blindness, paralysis and deafness, to the point where he was able to slowly complete a London marathon.

Worryingly,  it took significantly longer than that before Schumacher underwent the procedure to remove blood clots and reduce the potentially fatal swelling and pressure of the brain within the confines of the skull.

Although a helicopter reached Schumacher on an Alpine ski slope only eight minutes after he fell and crashed his head against a rock, it flew him initially to a small clinic nearby,

He was conscious at first but reports that he was in an ‘agitated state’ suggest it may have been a mistake not to take him directly to the main hospital in Grenoble.

On the slopes: Michael Schumacher - pictured in 2005 - is fighting for his life after hitting his head

That did not happen until more than an hour-and-a-half after the accident, subsequent to him losing consciousness.  Further time must have elapsed as the surgeons there prepared to operate, even if they did not wait for the arrival of his personal specialist from Paris.

Ironically, as Schumacher lies in an induced coma, only time will tell if those time lapses were critical.

The wide world of sport, boxing very much included, will be praying they were not.
