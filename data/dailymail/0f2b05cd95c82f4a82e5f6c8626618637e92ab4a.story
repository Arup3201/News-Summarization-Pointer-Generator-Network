A Highland castle once said to be haunted by a man hanged for stealing sheep, was placed on the market today for £2.25m.

Standing augustly in the centre of Dornoch, the grand building is a stone's throw away from the Scottish town's prestigious golf course and opposite the 12th-century cathedral where Madonna christened her son Rocco.

The castle, which dates back to the 15th
 century, commands extensive views along the coast towards the beach in 
nearby Sutherland and across the Dornoch Firth to the purple hills of 
Ross and Cromarty.

Haunted castle for sale: Potential buyers who aren't scared by the price might be more worried by stories that the ghost of a sheep thief was seen after being hung. However, a previous owner has had the building exorcised

But despite its great vantage point it was never intended for military purposes and was converted into a hotel in 1947.

Dornoch Castle played its part as a school, a jail and a courthouse, but it is perhaps best known for being haunted by a thief called Andrew McCornish who was imprisoned in its dungeons and then killed for snatching ewes and rams.

Marion Mackenzie, the daughter of the Sheriff Substitute of Sutherland, was the first person to claim to see McCornish's ghost at the end of the 19th century.

She said she saw a grey-haired man with a 'weird face', thick grey stockings and knee breeches sitting in her father's study when she came in from the garden to get some honeycomb for tea one day.

When she returned to the room with her family the apparition had gone.

Converted castle: The B-grade building in Dornoch, near Sutherland, was given permission to become a hotel in 1947. It boasts a bar with an open fire (pictured) and some of the original brickwork

But the legend says that McCornish's ghost reappeared later that night next to the bed of Marion's uncle, the Minister of Avoch, while he was sleeping.

Ms MacKenzie's uncle is reported to have woken up and told the ghost he would call his brother, who was the Sheriff, if he did not go away.

The ghost has never been seen since.

After listening to his brother and daughter's description of the ghost, Sheriff Mackenzie recognised it as McCornish.

Despite Andrew's disappearance, the castle's new owner in 1922 took no chances and had the building exorcised before moving in.

The property was renamed Dornoch Castle Hotel in 1947 and was featured in a programme about haunted hotels on the American Travel Channel in 2003.

It was originally built as the home for the Bishops of Caithness and then subsequently gifted to 11th Earl of Sutherland in 1557.

Although it was set on fire during a dispute between the McKays and Murrays in 1570 and then rebuilt, some of the original building does remain.

Despite being a category B-listed castle, which means it is of regional importance, permission was granted to turn it into a 25-room hotel.

Boasting a restaurant for 90 people and a bar with an open fire, it still features some of the 15th century brickwork and is a popular wedding venue.

Just a five-minute walk away lies the Dornoch Firth, which is a Site of Special Scientific Interest, making it a prime spot for twitchers, walkers and cyclists to visit.

Visitors with small planes and helicopters can also make use of the nearby Dornoch Airstrip.

Kevin Maley of Strutt & Parker who are selling the property said: 'Dornoch Castle Hotel is a quite stunning building, full of atmosphere and history, yet it also has all the luxuries one could expect from modern life.

'From general tourism to sports specific visitors and also weddings, this is a great opportunity for someone who wants to enter the hospitality industry or expand their portfolio.'

Prices for castles vary sharply from £375,000 which was asked for Kilmartin Castle in Scotland to the medieval Tulira Castle in County Galway, Ireland which was put up for sale for £5.5 million.
