It promises to give you the smooth, wrinkle-free skin of Twilight vampire Bella Cullen ... but without a single painful injection into the face.

Instead it uses a laser to make thousands of tiny holes in the face using the world's most powerful carbon dioxide laser, through which plasma from the patient's own blood is pushed using an ultrasound probe.

And Amie Mee, a 42-year-old beauty therapist from Edinburgh has become the world's first person to undergo the procedure - termed the needle-free 'vampire facelift' - in Glasgow.

Before and after: Amie Mee, 42, before the 'vampire facelift', left, and afterwards, right

The non-surgical operation was invented and carried out by Scottish plastic surgeon Dr Taimur Shoaib at his Belle Forme clinic.

The treatment is so-called because it uses the patient's own blood - taken from the arm - to make improvements to the skin. The plasma from the blood is then extracted and used in the non-invasive procedure, with the aim of rejuvenating the skin.

The technique is an updated version of the traditional 'vampire facelift', which involves a series of painful injections into the face.

Amie, who lives in Edinburgh, said: 
'I'm very happy with it - it's a brilliant result and I would definitely
recommend it. The procedure makes such a great improvement to your skin
in terms of pigmentation, texture and in other ways.'

She added: 'The laser part was a little uncomfortable but it was very quick, it only took a few minutes. Some people won't like the discomfort but it's worth it. After you've had a bit of downtime your skin just looks amazing.

'I decided to have the procedure done because I knew that it would be rejuvenating and I knew I would see results. It's actually a really good procedure to have because its all working in tune with the skin. I wanted my skin to be more youthful.'

Amie, who is originally from Leicester, said: 'Quite a few people have noticed a real difference. They think I look fresh or that I've been on holiday. It's a great treatment.'

Mr Shoaib, who lectures and trains 
other plastic surgeons all over the world on facial plastic surgery, 
said: 'The needle-free vampire facelift removes deep surface lines and 
wrinkles. It then keeps on working in various ways under the surface to enable the skin to produce collagen, its own youth serum.

'These non-invasive treatments are the future and as technology improves, so do the results.
I wanted to get away from using artificial chemicals and by using a 
patient's own fat or blood plasma there won't be any adverse reactions 
and the results look and feel very natural.

'The results have been great so far and 
I'm delighted to have created a new procedure which will push the 
boundaries of non-invasive cosmetic treatments.'

Mr Shoaib's treatment, which costs around Â£750, offers a less painful alternative to the traditional needle-based procedure.
