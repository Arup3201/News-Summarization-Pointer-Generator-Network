Growing up as a teenager is difficult but imagine doing it without a mother.

This was the reality that faced Aiesha Saunders when she lost her mother to liver cancer in 2010.

The Bankstown girl was 12 years old and was sent to live with her aunt.

After losing her mother when she was 12, Aiesha Saunders (left) signed up for the SISTER2sister program and was paired with 'big sister' Kristen Young (right)

'I love my dad but he's not around a lot. My mum was my entire family besides my aunty and I didn't really have anyone else,' the now 17-year-old told Daily Mail Australia.

'She was a mother, best friend, sister and everything rolled into one. 

'When I lost her I kind of lost everything.'

Luckily for Aiesha this was when she was introduced to Life Changing Experience Foundation's SISTER2sister program that aims to help the 48,000-plus Australian children who are abused or neglected, with young girls two or three times more likely to be abused than boys.

From Monday to Friday Step Up for Sisterhood Week is taking place, and people will get the chance to help these children by donating to the program.

It assists girls aged between 12 and 18 who are 'at risk' due to extreme suffering as a direct result of trauma, bereavement, poverty, sexual abuse, mental abuse, physical abuse, neglect, homelessness, sickness or disability, and destitution.

Aiesha is one of these children who benefit from the program and was set her up with 'big sister' Kristen Young.

'When my mother passed away... I was quite young and still figuring out who I was and it was important that I had another strong role model in my life,' she said.

'Kristen has been a big part of my life. Even if it's something small or I've had a bad day at school, it's nice to meet up with someone and have a coffee. It's nice to know someone who's there for. 

'I don't know where I would be without not just Kristen, but Marnie who organises everything and Jess who is the founder of program. 

They also have fun together, including going white water rafting together (pictured above, back left and right)

Aiesha, now 17, is an aspiring journalist with an interest in music and had her first article published recently

'Family is important but it's nice to have someone else to have that extra support.'

Not only has Ms Young helped Aiesha cope with her mother's death but doled out career advice.

'She's a rock for me to chase my career goals and she's in PR [public relations] and I've always been wanted to be a journalist. 

'She's sat me down and said we can talk to this person or that person. 

'My aunt is busy and it's nice for us to have that common interest. 

'Kristen spent ages knitting me this blanket. It's just a blanket but it's nice to see someone put that much effort in.' 

Aiesha said the program also brought her in to contact with other fantastic young women who understood her struggles. 

'When you're down in the dumps, I found out there were others who going through it as well,' she said.

'It makes you feel less alone when you have a group of people around you.'

The SISTER2sister program, which brought Ms Young and Aiesha together, is looking for donations this week during Step Up for Sisterhood Week.

And since her introduction to the program she has already reached a significant milestone with the help of her 'big sister'. 

'Recently I just had the first article published. Music was for me and [Kristen] pushed me in that direction and I was doing things I didn't know I was going to be doing from a young age,' Aiesha said.

'These sisters have their own lives and give their time up for young girls and bringing out some amazing women.

'I went to a reunion and saw [other 'little sisters] and to see where they were five to 10 years ago and where they are now is amazing.'

The program is not only rewarding to those who receive help but for those who voluntarily give up their time to mentor young girls.

Aiesha's 'big sister' Kristen Young joined three years ago and has never looked back, saying she wanted to give back to the community.

'I'm one of those people who thinks if I can't change the world by myself, at least I can change one person’s life,' she said.

'[The program is] such a fantastic way to change a girl's life and give experiences what I had in my childhood.'

Despite an unconventional upbringing where she moved around a lot, attending seven schools in three countries by the time she graduated high school, Ms Young said she knew what it was like trying to fit in as a teenager.

'I was the master of being the new kid. I used to go to a school every four years,' she said. 

'I looked back on the time and say it was fantastic but then I felt like a fish out of water when I was a teenager, struggling with confidence.'

But Ms Young said it was not only her 'little sister' who was learning new things.

'She was hell lot more mature than I was at that age, and I've learned a lot from her,' she said.
