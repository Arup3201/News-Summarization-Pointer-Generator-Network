Shocking new images have emerged showing the risks taken and the injuries sustained by the young  men who jump on to and off speeding trains in Mexico in a desperate attempt to reach the United States.

The majority of those attempting to hitch a ride on the trains are from Central American countries like Honduras and El Salvador who are willing to risk their lives for the opportunity to work illegally in menial jobs should they ever actually reach the U.S..

Referring to America as 'the promised land' the train hoppers that manage to make it on to a speeding locomotive are seen clinging on for dear life as they tear through the countryside of northern Mexico to the border they stand little to no chance of actually making it across.

Shocking: The images show the risks taken and the injuries sustained by the young men who jump on to and off speeding trains in Mexico in a desperate attempt to reach the United States

Making a jump: A man is seen either jumping or falling off of a speeding train as it passes through the Mexican countryside near Tabasc

Treatment: A seriously injured young man is taken to hospital by medical workers after a failed train jump near the city of Tabasco

Recovery: Raul Ordonez Martinez, 42, is seen recovering after having both legs amputated at the Municipal Hospital Emiliano Zapata. Raul had both legs amputated after he tried to jump on a moving train in Tenosique

Before the U.S.-bound trains appear on the horizon, the young men are seen relaxing and sleeping on the railway tracks of northern Mexico. Many of them have already travelled thousands of miles from countries deeper in South America - but their journey is far from finished.

While many of the young men wait near train stations so they can jump on to trains that have yet to build up speed, others consider that approach fair to likely to raise the suspicions of the driver or platform guards.

Instead they wait out in the Mexican countryside, where they are unlikely to have been spotted and make the death-defying leap on to trains speeding along the rails.

While many somehow manage to make it on to the trains, others are unsurprisingly dragged beneath the 36-inch steel wheels and crushed to death. 

One of the biggest threats to the young men's lives is exhaustion. 

Having already travelled thousands of miles and spent several nights clinging to trains or sleeping in the open, when the time comes for them to make the all-important jump, their bodies fail them and they either fatally miscalculate the leap, or else suffer life-changing disabilities.

Wedged between cargo cars, perched on tanker tops, stuck in stuffy boxcars, with money sewn into shirt cuffs and pants hems, they hop on, often in daylight, high noon even, because arresting impoverished migrants has not, historically, been a top priority in Mexico

Dozens of desperate young men die every year jumping on to U.S.-bound trains in Mexico. The majority have come from poverty-stricken countries such as Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador and are aged in their late teens or early 20s.

Another thing unites the men too - their all or nothing desire to start new lives in the United States where, as illegal immigrants, they are unlikely to find work other than as exploited, below-minimum-wage workers in restaurants, cleaning and maintenance businesses and on building sites.

'The trains are for the poorest of the poor,' says Carlos Miranda, a migration expert in the southern state of Chiapas. 'If they thought they had any other choice, they would take it.'

Nobody knows precisely how many migrants take the trains, but on certain days, in the most popular train towns - Arriaga, along the southern Pacific Coast, and Tenosique, a modest farming town south of the Yucatan - you will find hundreds, even thousands, of people waiting by the tracks.

If they are lucky, they will hang on long enough to make it to Mexico City, where they switch lines in the massive train yards, and then in dwindling numbers head out again, pushing north to the U.S. border, or as close as they can get.

The risks are enormous: They must navigate a spidery network of aging rails — the trains themselves sometimes jump the tracks — through jungles and deserts and mountains, searing heat and icy rain. 

They face attacks by the bandits and gun-toting gangs that patrol the trains, and must hop off and on at immigration checkpoints, risking limb and life each time. The trip can take weeks, or months, if you allow for all the pitfalls and stopovers to earn a few pesos for food. 

Death-defying: Mexico tries to catch the train hoppers before they enter the country. But the southern border is porous, and, says Mexico's immigration commissioner, Hipolito Trevino, 'we cannot stop them all'

New life: A train jumper with a missing leg is seen using crutches to travel through the Mexican town of Tabasco earlier this month

Forty million people live in Central America, and nearly half are poor.

In Honduras, 46 per cent live in extreme poverty. In Guatemala, 130,000 lost their homes in Hurricane Stan. El Salvador is crippled by drought, and in Nicaragua, one of the poorest countries in the hemisphere, the majority of the people have little or no work. This is why they come.

Mexico tries to catch the train jumpers before they enter the country. But this southern border is porous, and, says Mexico's immigration commissioner, Hipolito Trevino, 'we cannot stop them all.'

How many lose arms or legs along the way? Impossible to know - not everyone is counted. 

Wedged between cargo cars, perched on tanker tops, stuck in stuffy boxcars, with money sewn into shirt cuffs and pants hems, they hop on, often in daylight, high noon even, because arresting impoverished migrants has not, historically, been a top priority in Mexico.

Women and children are most vulnerable, to both the elements and to the men, and are usually the most difficult to spot. 

If they can, they wait for the trains to stop in the dusty yards then make a dash for it. You can find them hiding in the dark hollows of the hopper cars, the children wide-eyed, their mothers fingering the family Bible.
