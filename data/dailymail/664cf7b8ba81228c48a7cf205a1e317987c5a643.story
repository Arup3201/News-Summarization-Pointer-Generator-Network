Rarely-seen pictures of a 21-year-old Elvis Presley in the beginning of his career show all stars start somewhere, even the King of rock 'n' roll,

Taken by photographer Alfred Wertheimer during Elvis' time on the road in 1956, the snaps show that despite his tender years, he already had his legendary movements and Brylcreem hairdo figured out.

Mr Wertheimer, now 83, caught the would-be King's more intimate moments as he records his music, performs on tour and sneaks a kiss with a young fan backstage.

A star is born: A 21-year-old Elvis 'kisses' young fan Barbara Gray just before going on stage at the the Mosque Theatre Richmond, Virginia, in June 1956

Taken shortly after the legend had been signed by record company RCA Victor, some of the black and white snaps for 
the new book include a 21-year-old Elvis and a young fan sharing a tender moment just before he goes on stage.

The famous photograph - known as 'The Kiss' - was taken without Elvis' or the young woman's knowledge and had become one of the most iconic of the King in his early years.

The fresh-faced singer actually touches the blonde girl's tongue with his in the spontaneous moment.

'I never bothered to ask her name,' German-born Wertheimer said in a Vanity Fair interview about 'The Kiss' in 2011. 'And she never bothered to tell me.'

In fact the buxom blonde is Barbara Gray, or Bobbi Owens as she was known back then, a young woman to whom Elvis had spoken over the phone and had arranged to meet in Richmond.

Making history: Elvis already had his signature moves down to a T when he performed at the age of 21 on stage at the Mosque Theatre Richmond, Virginia, in June 1956

When they met in person, they spent 
the day together, and Mr Wertheimer captured it all, photographing them
flirting and being playful in the back seat of a taxi.

Later that day, Mr Wertheimer grew concerned when he found he had lost Elvis just before the show was about to start.

As he walked around the theatre 
looking for him, he saw two figures at the end of a dark, narrow hallway
- the future rock star, and his date for the day.

He thought about letting the two have
their private moment, but then thought better of it, saying 'the worst 
that can happen is that he’ll ask me to leave'.

Speaking in 2011, Mr Wertheimer said 
he was never asked about all the pictures he took that day until 19 
years later, when Elvis was found dead in his Graceland mansion.

He told the Today Show: 'The day he died, Time magazine called me and asked me to bring all my photos over immediately.'

Among those photos was 'The Kiss'.

Despite the closeness evident in the 
photos, Mrs Gray, 75, said she didn't have as much attraction to the 
singer as he did for her, and she never saw him again.

'Maybe he had sparks, but I never even knew who he was.'

Another image taken a few minutes 
later shows Elvis on stage, kneeling down on his left knee while singing
into the microphone as he wows the audience who had never seen or heard
anything like it before.

Another photo taken on March 17, 1956 -
about two months after he was signed - is of Elvis performing for 
American TV's Stage Show.

In it, he is depicted holding an acoustic guitar while singing into the microphone and displaying his famous lip-curl.

Over 400 photos, many of which have 
never been seen before, are being published in the new book entitled 
'Elvis and the Birth of Rock and Roll' which has been produced by 
London-based Taschen.

A spokesman for the publishers said: 
‘Alfred worked with Elvis on his very first tour before his fame took 
off and tighter controls were put on images of him.

‘Alfred had unprecedented and unlimited access to Elvis and was able to get so many candid shots.

‘Some of the photos are well known but others haven't been seen before.

‘We have wanted to work with Alfred 
for some time now. We have used his original negatives and made them as 
high resolution as possible for the book.’

Elvis Presley died on August 16, 1977, from a heart attack after battling prescription drug abuse.

His abrupt death at the age of 42 shocked legions of fans still mesmerised today by his singing, sex appeal and on-stage charisma.
