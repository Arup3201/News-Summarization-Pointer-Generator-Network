Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond suffered world wide internet ridicule today after a football photo-op went badly wrong.

The SNP leader was snapped in a Ministry of Silly Walks-style pose after taking a penalty on a visit to a new football training centre in Rutherglen, Lanarkshire.

Hearts fan Mr Salmond was soon mocked up in a series of internet spoof images which went viral on social media sites Facebook and Twitter.

Alex Salmond was snapped shortly after taking a penalty at a new football training centre in Lanarkshire yesterday. The image of the SNP leader was soon mocked up alongside a host of goosestepping celebrities on the internet

Among the spoofs of the SNP leader are one in which he appears alongside Michael Flatley in Riverdance, another with ‘twerking’ singer Miley Cyrus and one with John Cleese playing crazed hotelier Basil Fawlty.

Mr Salmond was placed beside the comic in a still from The Germans, a 1975 episode of Fawlty Towers in which he goose-steps Nazi-style around the hotel lobby.

Mr Salmond is not the first politician
 to come to regret a photo-opportunity and comes just days after Labour 
leader Ed Miliband suffered similar humiliation after he was pictured 
struggling to eat a bacon sandwich.

Former
 Labour leader Neil Kinnock was notoriously snapped slipping and falling
 into the waves at in 1983 and being helped to his feet by wife Glenys.

The images of Mr Salmond went viral on the internet as Facebook and Twitter users competed with each other to produce the funniest pictures

Mr Salmond's bid to lead Scotland out of the United Kingdom is unlikely to be helped by the online mockery

Former Scottish First Minister Jack McConnell says he is 'haunted' by an image of him wearing a pinstriped kilt at a New York charity fashion show in 2004.

Mr Salmond himself has been caught before - when in 2012 he was pictured wearing a plastic hair net and greedily eyeing a Tunnock’s Teacake during a visit to the bakery in Uddingston, Lanarkshire.

The Scottish leader was trying to show his football skills shown as he announced funding of £600,000 for a football training for vulnerable youngsters, as part of a legacy project for the Glasgow 2014 games.
