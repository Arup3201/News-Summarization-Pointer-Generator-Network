People from the North East splash out more than any other region on their summer getaway - spending an average of £1,150 per person on holiday.

Sunseekers from Wales and the South East closely follow to make up the top three biggest spenders.

Meanwhile those in the West Midlands and Yorkshire typically fork out the least, down to just £310 a head.

Getting away from home: People from the North East splash out more than any other region in the country, spending an average of £1,150 per person

The survey polled 2,542 UK adults, from a balanced age range and an equal spread of regions who had been away on a summer holiday in the past year.

It also compared their bills to their wages, revealing that residents of the North East spent seven per cent of their annual income on the trip, whilst Londoners only spent 2.6 per cent.

George Charles, spokesperson for VoucherCodesPro.co.uk, said the results were surprising.

'Many would assume that high fliers of London would spend more money on their holidays, as they earn more money. 

'However, our research has shown that the lower earners of the North East spend the most, showing that perhaps they like to spend their hard earned money on more expensive, luxury holidays.

'I am a little surprised that the North East spends the most on their holidays, considering it is a higher percentage of their annual wage than other areas of the country. 

'Getting the most out of your money is important in life and that includes with holidays. 

'There are fantastic deals around so that you can get the luxury holiday you desire for less.'
