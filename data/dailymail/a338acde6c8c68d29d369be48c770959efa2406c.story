Three Albuquerque teenagers accused of fatally beating two homeless men beyond recognition have been ordered held on $5 million bonds.

Police say they are also investigating claims by one of the teens that the trio had been terrorizing transients around Albuquerque, New Mexico, for months.

Prosecutors requested $1 million bond for each of the three during initial appearances on Monday, but Metropolitan Court Judge Linda Rogers set bond at $5 million. She cited the gravity of the alleged crimes and the suspects' potential to flee.

Alex Rios, 18, Nathaniel Carrillo, 16 and Gilbert Tafoya, 15, have been charged with open counts of murder and are being held in Bernalillo County detention facilities.

Rios has been charged with two counts each of murder, conspiracy to commit first-degree felony and contributing to the delinquency of a minor. He also faces three counts of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon and one count each of tampering with evidence and robbery.

Carrillo and Tafoya will likely be charged with murder as adults, Drobik said.

‘I personally, after reading that complaint, was sick to my stomach because of the nature of the violence and the age of the offenders,’ Drobik said.

Officers responded Saturday around 8 a.m. to a 911 call reporting two bodies in a field. They found one victim lying on a mattress and another lying on the ground. Jerome Eskeets, a third victim who said he was able to flee, was hospitalized for his injuries.

Eskeets told police that he recognized one of the ‘kids’ hitting and kicking him as someone who lived in a house nearby. Police went to the home and found the three suspects, according to the complaint. The homeowner identified Tafoya and Carrillo as his sons and Rios as a friend who had spent the night.

Investigators say in the complaint that blood on the waist band of Tafoya’s shorts triggered further investigating and interviews with all three.

Rios told investigators he acted as a 
lookout while the other boys attacked both men with bricks, sticks and a
 metal fence pole. He said the victims were struck all over, including 
in the face and chest.

The
 younger suspects, however, told police that Rios also took part in the 
attacks. Both boys said they wanted to look for someone to beat up and 
possibly rob.

Both describe how all three covered their faces with black T-shirts before walking over to the victims, who were lying down. Then the trio allegedly used various objects to attack the men, including cinder blocks.

According to Tafoya, they all took turns picking up cinder blocks over their heads and smashing them into the men's faces more than 10 times.

The suspects said after the attack, they took one victim's driver's license and debit card. The license was found in the teens' home, police said.

According to Tafoya, all three have previously attacked homeless people around Albuquerque. The teens claim to have assaulted as many as 50 vagrants, reports NBC News.

Police are now going to look into open cases involving attacks on transients to see if they are related, Drobik said.

Meanwhile, investigators have not yet officially confirmed the identities of the two victims. Their transient background and the severity of their injuries have made identifying them somewhat difficult, Drobik said.

The department is asking anyone in the homeless community with information to get in touch with them. Drobik said any transients uncomfortable approaching police can also contact them through any social service agency.

‘Just please come forward,’ Drobik said.

Family and attorneys for the three declined comment after the court proceeding.
