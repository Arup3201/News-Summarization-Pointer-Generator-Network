West Ham United vs Hull (Upton Park)

Team news

West Ham

West Ham boss Sam Allardyce is hoping for a double defensive fitness boost ahead of Sunday's visit of Hull.

Winston Reid (ankle) missed the FA Cup third-round replay win over Everton on Tuesday but is now back in training, as is full-back Guy Demel who has been sidelined since the turn of the year with a muscle problem.

That means only top-scorer Diafra Sakho (back) and Cheikhou Kouyate (international duty) are definite absentees.

Provisional squad: Adrian, Jaaskelainen, Cresswell, O'Brien, Reid, Demel, Collins, Jenkinson, Noble, Song, Nolan, Amalfitano, Downing, Poyet, Jarvis, Vaz Te, Cole, Carroll, Valencia.

Hull 

Sone Aluko and Gaston Ramirez will return to training ahead of Hull's trip to West Ham to offer manager Steve Bruce some hope of solving his striker crisis.

Bruce saw strike pair Nikica Jelavic and Abel Hernandez injured in the 1-0 defeat at West Brom last weekend with both out for several weeks.

Andy Robertson (ankle), Liam Rosenior (hamstring), and Mohamed Diame (knee) remain out.

Provisional squad: McGregor, Jakupovic, Harper, Chester, Davies, Maguire, McShane, Figueroa, Bruce, Elmohamady, Livermore, Meyler, Ince, Brady, Quinn, Huddlestone, Aluko, Ramirez, Sagbo.
