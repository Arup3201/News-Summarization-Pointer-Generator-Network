Britain risks returning to the anti-immigrant rhetoric of Enoch Powell’s infamous ‘rivers of blood’ speech, Archbishop Desmond Tutu has warned.

The Nobel peace laureate said the intense debate over opening borders to new migrants from Romania and Bulgaria risked overshadowing the ‘opportunity’ presented by new arrivals to Britain.

The intervention comes as a poll showed almost half of Britons think the right to work and live in the UK should be blocked for Romanians and Bulgarians.

Concerns have been raised in Westminster over the numbers of Romanians and Bulgarians who might come to the UK when movement controls imposed when they joined the European Union expire in January.

The government is considering extending the amount of time migrants have to be in the UK before they can claim benefits from three months to up to six months.

Ministers are also examining how to curb access to housing, benefits and NHS treatment for new arrivals to tackle the ‘pull factors’ which attract people to Britain.

Enoch Powell was a senior Conservative politician in the 1950s and 1960s, serving as a Treasury minister and health minister under Harold Macmillan.

But in 1968 he was sacked as shadow defence secretary by Tory leader Ted Heath for a controversial speech on Commonwealth immigration.

He claimed that not all immigrants wanted to integrate in Britain, instead seeking to foster racial and religious differences 'with a view to the exercise of actual domination, first over fellow-immigrants and then over the rest of the population'.

He added: 'As I look ahead, I am filled with foreboding. Like the Roman, I seem to see "the River Tiber foaming with much blood".'

It became known as the Rivers of Blood speech. Heath said it was 'inflammatory and liable to damage race relations'.

More than 40 years later, Tory Treasury minister Sajid Javid said that damage has still not been repaired.

But Archbishop Tutu said the issue risked creating racial tensions last seen in the 1968s, when senior Conservative Mr Powell criticised immigration from the Commonwealth, saying: ‘As I look ahead, I am filled with foreboding; like the Roman, I seem to see “the River Tiber foaming with much blood”.’

Archbishop Tutu warned: ‘We are beginning to hear the same kind of tune that we had when Enoch Powell was doing his stuff..

‘I thought that was one of the worst moments of your modern history.’

He said it was people from Britain who helped to ‘recover’ South Africa's humanity.

Speaking on a visit where he was granted the Freedom of the City of London, he added: ‘I hope you do not miss the opportunity [of immigration].

‘Opposing it would be just for short-term returns. People are worried, rightly of course, about economics but in the end those who do not share end up not actually enriched. They are certainly going to be impoverished in their humanity.’

The former Archbishop of Cape Town spoke about the ‘how welcoming and affirming people’ were for him and his wife when they first came to Britain in 1962.

His comments were echoed by The Bishop of London, the Right Rev Richard Chartres, who said: ‘Our immigrants are an economic advantage. The diversity of this place is part of its attraction.’

Meanwhile, an opinion poll for Channel
5 News found 47 per cent of people thought migrants from the two 
countries should have no right to live, work or claim benefits in the UK
and 56 per cent believed immigration had resulted in a negative impact 
on Britain.

One in four 
people surveyed in the Chancel 5 News poll thought Romanians and 
Bulgarians should be treated the same as other EU citizens and 18 per 
cent thought they should have more limited rights to live, work and 
access welfare in the UK.

A 
third of people surveyed over-estimated the percentage of people born 
outside the UK living in the country, thinking the figure was over 40 
per cent, rather than the 13 per cent indicated in the 2011 census.

More
than a quarter (27 per cent) of those surveyed said Ukip had the best 
immigration policies, followed by Labour on 18 per cent, the Tories on 
12 per cent and Lib Dems on 7 per cent.

The UK government is under pressure to curb entry to the UK when EU restrictions on Romanians and Bulgarians coming here to work are lifted in January

Romania's Foreign Minister, Titus 
Corlatean told Channel 5 News he did not expect a ‘flood’ of migrants 
from his country to come to Britain after January 1 and attacked the way
the immigration debate had been conducted in the UK.

He
said Mr Cameron should reject ‘in clear terms if it's possible the 
xenophobic and populistic and once again sometimes racist attitudes 
which are promoted by some other British politicians’.

The
Bulgarian ambassador to the UK, Konstantin Dimitrov, also accused some 
politicians of making ‘highly unacceptable ... prejudicial’ comments 
about his countrymen.
