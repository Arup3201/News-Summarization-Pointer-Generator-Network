A California man shot his two adult daughters, before apparently committing suicide while his three young grandchildren were in the home.

An 8-year old girl called 911 to report gunfire at 4:30 AM, and deputies arrived to find 63-year old Anthony Alvarez dead from what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the Tulare County Sheriff's Department said in a statement.

Jennifer Kimble, 37, the mother of the young girl and two teenage boys present at the time of shootings was found dead from multiple gunshot wounds.

Alvarez's other daughter Valerie Alvarez, 33, who is disabled, was critically wounded. She was air lifted to a local hospital and is reported to be in critical condition.

Police are now looking to the 8-year old girl and her 11 and 13 year-old brothers for answers.

The 8-year old girl woke up to find her mother and grandfather dead, and her aunt seriously wounded.

The children, who were unharmed by their grandfather, were reunited with their father by police. He had been at work at the time of the shootings.

'It's going to be complicated for our detectives because we can't ask Jennifer what happened and we can't ask Anthony what happened,' Sergeant Chris Douglass toldÂ ABC Action News 30.

The police will also question Valerie, who is reported to be stable after undergoing surgery.

Though they don't have definite answers yet, Douglass had not doubt that Anthony Alvarez had shot his daughters and turned the gun on himself.

Authorities believe that Alvarez got in to a fight with Kimble, which quickly turned violent.

'It's a very cut-and-dried case,' Douglass said.

Neighbors speculated that Alvarez's motive had to do with his late wife's death last year.

"It's a big surprise. I just 
can't believe it. Poor kids," neighbor Felicia Marroquin told the local news station.

According to neighbors the family, who all live together in one home, were planning to take the children to Disneyland later this week.
