The most powerful men and women in the world last night sat down for dinner in the luxurious surroundings of the Peterhof Palace in St Petersburg.

The luxurious setting and the seemingly civil ambience belies the simmering tensions and rivalry that have dogged the G20 summit in Russia as nations clash, Cold War-style, over the civil war tearing through Syria.

Earlier world leaders were seen strolling through the impressive gardens of Peterhof Palace, laid out on the orders of Peter the Great and known as the 'Russian Versailles'. Actors dressed in period clothing befitting the opulent surroundings also entertained the heads of state

European contingent: (L-R) British Prime Minister David Cameron, French President Francois Hollande, Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel and European Council President Herman Van Rompuy

However, the opulence of the surroundings was not lost on
one Twitter user, who posted: 'Let them eat yellowcake (a type of Uranium ore):
Versailles revisited.'

Earlier, U.S. President Barack Obama said he was convinced that the chemical attack in Damascus last month was the work of the Syrian government and claims the world must intervene to prevent further attacks and uphold the Chemical Weapons Convention.

However, Russia's president Vladimir Putin, an ally of the regime of Bashar Assad, dismissed the idea that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would risk retaliation by using chemical weapons.

He called the evidence the U.S. has gathered as 'groundless'.

The extravagant show and air of festivity sat at odds with the gravity of discussions

The threat of missiles over the Mediterranean is weighing on world leaders meeting on the shores of the Baltic this week, and eclipsing economic battles that usually dominate when the G-20 world economies meet

There was also tension between Russia and Britain, after President Putin's official spokesman Dimitry Peskov reportedly wrote the UK off as 'just a small island no-one pays any attention to'.

In an astonishing attack, Vladimir Putin mocked the UK's size and influence and boasted that Soviet oligarchs had 'bought Chelsea'.

It was unclear whether this was a reference to the exclusive London borough or the football club.

The alleged remarks came as David Cameron continued to make the case for intervention in Syria despite his shock defeat in Parliament last week.

Russian officials flatly denied the remarks had ever been made.

If they were, it would represent an extraordinary breach of diplomatic protocol, particularly as Russia is hosting the G20 meeting.
