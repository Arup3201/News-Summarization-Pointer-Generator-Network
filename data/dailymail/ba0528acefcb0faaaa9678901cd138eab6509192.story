Knifepoint robberies rose by 10 per cent last year, official crime figures have revealed.

Police statistics show one victim is held up by a knife-carrying criminal every 35 minutes.

Senior officers have warned the attacks are carried out by muggers determined to steal smartphones and cash.

On the rise: The number of robberies committed at knife-point rose by 10 per cent in the year to September 2011, new figures show (picture posed by models)

Separate figures show a double digit rise in the number of pickpocket thefts – the biggest increase for nearly a decade.

Across England and Wales, robbery rose by 4 per cent in the year to September 2011 compared with the previous 12 months.

There were 15,313 knifepoint robberies in the same period – up 10 per cent from the 13,971 offences a year earlier, police crime statistics showed.

Around half of all robberies took place in London and the most common items stolen were smartphones, bags and cash. 

The Metropolitan Police recorded a 13 per cent rise in robberies in the capital and West Midlands Police recorded a 10 per cent increase.

Former Met commissioner Lord Stevens, who is chairing a commission into the future of policing set up by Labour, said the rise in crimes against the person was ‘a bit alarming’.

He said: ‘I’m not surprised. It’s really worrying. We’ve got to get on top of them really quickly or you could run out of control.’

The British Crime Survey, based on a poll of more than 40,000 victims, suggested a 5 per cent rise in burglary, and a 7 per cent increase in car theft.

Pickpocket thefts rose by 12 per cent to nearly 600,000, while garden shed break-ins fuelled a 15 per cent rise in other thefts of personal property.

Policing minister Nick Herbert said there are areas of concern and crime remains too high

However ministers will be heartened that overall recorded crime fell fractionally. The number recorded was down by 4 per cent to 4.1million. Chief Constable Jon Murphy, from the Association of Chief Police Officers, said: ‘While incidents in violence against the person fell, a continued cause for concern was the increase in pickpocketing, robbery and robbery with knives.’

‘This has been driven by a rise in robberies of personal property and police will want to focus on tackling these offences and offering crime-prevention advice.’

Meanwhile the number of murders and other killings rose by 5 per cent in the year to March 2011, said the Home Office.

That is a rise of 28 – taking the total number of violent deaths to 636, up from 608 in 2009/10. The latter includes the 12 victims of the Cumbrian shootings in June 2010 by Derrick Bird. Ministers are set to introduce a ‘tough’ law meaning automatic jail for anyone caught carrying a knife with the intention of using it to commit a crime.  

Currently just one in five of those caught carrying a knife is given a jail term. The rest are handed community sentences, fines or other punishments.

Policing minister Nick Herbert said: ‘Today’s crime figures cannot be used to show there is a long-term change in either direction. There are areas of concern and, as we have consistently said, crime remains too high.

‘We know good policing makes a difference.’

Justice Secretary Ken Clarke has introduced a number of measures to reduce the prison population

Ken Clarke (right) has come under constant attack over his money-saving plans to reduce the prison population by 3,000 by putting fewer offenders behind bars.

He stunned the Tory conference in 2010 by announcing he wanted to scrap prison term of less than six months in favour of community sentences.

That policy was heavily criticised last month after it emerged a quarter of criminals break their non-custodial punishments.

Last year, the Justice Secretary caused outrage by suggesting that some rapes were more serious than others as he attempted to defend proposed shorter jail terms for some rapists.

Then last May it was revealed that less than a third of convicted muggers and car thieves end up in jail.

Furthermore, just over half of drug dealers go to prison – and only 43 per cent of those who have sex with a child under 13 are put behind bars.

The row within the Tory Party itself about the Justice Secretary's approach re-emerged in October when Home Secretary Theresa May and Boris Johnson urged him to extend minimum jail terms to under-18s.

However, he dismissed their call.

A month later, it emerged that youth courts are jailing just one in four teenage muggers.

Most young criminals are facing nothing harsher than rehabilitation, fines or community service.

Even during the 'crackdown' over August's riots, the average sentence was well below two years.
