Waris Dirie with her Sacla Women of the Year Campaign Award, after the ceremony at the InterContinental Hotel, central London.

She has fronted campaigns for Chanel and Revlon and even starred in a James Bond movie.

But Waris Dirie really caught the world’s attention in 1997 when she opened up about her horrific female genital mutilation (FGM) ordeal.

She has since campaigned tirelessly against the practice and now her efforts have been recognised in the form of a Woman of the Year Campaigning award.

Waris, now 48 and living in Poland 
with her four children, was just five years old when she was subjected 
to FGM in her home country of Somalia.

She
 was then forced into marrying a 60-year-old man when she was just 
thirteen, a threat which left her no choice but to flee to Mogadish, 
where she had family.

She
 later moved to London to live with relatives and worked in a local 
McDonald's before getting her big break when she was scouted by a 
fashion photographer in the 1990s.

Her career as a supermodel went from 
strength to strength and she starred in Chanel campaigns and even made a
 cameo appearance in James Bond movie, The Living Daylights.

But her life was fickle. ‘I thought, 
“This is b*****t, fake. I couldn’t sleep one more night knowing the 
truth about what was happening to girls,’ she told The Guardian. And that’s when she decided to speak up.

In a candid interview with Marie Claire 
at the height of her fame in 1997, Waris revealed her dark past whereby 
she was subjected to FGM and left to recover in a makeshift shelter 
under a tree for several days. She has since set about saving other 
young girls from enduring what she suffered.

She has since been appointed a UN 
special ambassador and set up her own charity, Desert Flower Foundation,
 to help protect girls against the practice, which involves partial or 
total removal of the external female genitalia for non-medical reasons.

Waris Dirie really caught the world's attention in 1997 when she opened up about her horrific female genital mutilation (FGM) ordeal.

The practice – which many believe 
leaves a girl ‘clean’ in preparation for her marriage - usually happens 
before girls reach the age of fifteen but can be performed on babies at 
birth too. It causes intense pain, risk of infection and can even lead 
to fatal childbirth later in life.

Despite
 being illegal in the UK, FGM is on the rise with an estimated 66,000 
women dealing with the after-effects and more than 20,000 young girls 
thought to be at risk.

Worldwide,
 more than three million women have been subjected to FGM, many of whom 
come from East African countries such as Uganda, Kenya and Somalia.

Rudimentary tools are often used to perform the operations, like these 
found in Kenya (pictured left). The procedure is often performed on 
young girls like nine-year-old Fay Mohammed (pictured right).

Those countries, many of which are part of the Commonwealth, are at the heart of Britain's FGM problem, and as a result, the majority of British women to suffer FGM are part of the UK's 600,000-strong ethnic African community.

When people fled from Al Shabab in Somalia or Idi Amin in Uganda, many came to the UK - bringing with them local traditions, including FGM.

But East Africa isn't the only place where the practice is widespread. Women in Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Yemen and others are also highly likely to be forced to undergo FGM.

‘If a white man or woman saw a white child that is mutilated, there would be screaming. I guarantee it would end. This is abuse against a child, so to say it’s to do with your religion or race, it’s all wrong. This is about child protection,' said Waris.

Waris wants the issue to be debated on TV, in the media and by politicians and maintains that, by having it out in the open, we can fight it.

Her campaign work is endless. Last month she opened the first medical centre in Berlin that will offer FGM sufferers reconstructive surgery and she hopes to roll this initiative out to Kenya, Ethiopia, the Netherlands and Switzerland.

Waris, a five times bestselling author who writes on the topic of FGM, said she was 'honoured' to receive her Women of the Year Campaigning Award this week.

Baroness Helena Kennedy QC, president of Women of the Year, said: 'Waris is a very worthy recipient of this Women of the Year award. Her astonishing bravery and commitment to this cause has  brought this horrific crime against girls and women to the world’s attention.

'She provides hope and inspiration to victims that one day this abhorrent practice will be eradicated.'

'I can't turn back, not now I'm almost there. You just have to keep going until one day it will come to an end,' added Waris.
