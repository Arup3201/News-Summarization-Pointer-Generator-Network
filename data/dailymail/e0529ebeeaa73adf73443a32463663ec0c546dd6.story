A Columbia high school student is facing possible felony charges in criminal court after she was arrested for changing a classmate's name in the school yearbook to a sexually suggestive term.

Kaitlyn Booth, 17, a student at Hickman High School in Columbia, Missouri was arrested May 14 on suspicion of changing a student's last name from Mastain to 'masturbate' in the yearbook.

She could be charged with first-degree property damage, a felony, and harassment.

Booth also faces punishment at school, but Hickman Principal Tracey Conrad declined to discuss specifics.

The butt of Booth’s prank, Raigan Mastain, told the Columbia Daily Tribute that she ‘wasn't devastated’ over the incident and was surprised the student was arrested.

‘When you're in high school, you do stuff that is not necessarily the smartest, and this was an example of that,’ she said.

The issue was brought to the principal's attention the day the yearbook was distributed. 

Rather than pulping 700 yearbooks, students at Hickman High School spent 12 hours placing stickers on the altered page with Raigan Mastain's correct name on it

The school decided against reprinting more than 700 yearbooks, which would have cost $41,000, and instead yearbook staff spent 12 hours placing stickers on the altered page with the student's correct name.

'The yearbook staff worked diligently to retrieve the ones that had been handed out and to put the stickers over the pages of the yearbooks that were yet to be handed out,' said Principal Conrad.

Mastain said she and Booth worked together on the yearbook staff, and although they weren't friends, she didn't think Booth had any sort of issue with her.

She said she hopes Booth is doing OK. 'What she did wasn't right, but I don't think it should affect her for the rest of her life,' she said.

The biggest frustration, said Mastain, was that everyone was focused on the name change instead of the yearbook, which she said she and other staff members had put countless hours into.
