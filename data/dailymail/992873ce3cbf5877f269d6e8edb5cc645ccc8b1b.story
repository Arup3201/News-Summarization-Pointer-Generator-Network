Luis Enrique praised his team's performance against Celta Vigo, despite Barcelona slipping to their second consecutive defeat.

Although they dominated the match, Barca were unable to find the net, and Joaquin Larrivey's goal was enough to earn the visitors all three points.

But Enrique said his side were simply unlucky to come up against a goalkeeper in fine form, and would bounce back after the international break.

'I think we deserved to win this match,' the Barca manager said after the game. 'Unfortunately, football is a capricious sport that only rewards the team who scores goals, I mean the team that is effective and today we haven't done that.

'Celta's goalkeeper has done amazing and today it wasn't our day and we had this scoreline.

'Moreover it happens in an  'friendly' week, in an interesting week and in a week where the time of criticism starts.

'But it is our responsibility to stand up, all of us, the stuff, the managers, the players, the club. We have to move forward.'

The defeat came against Enrique's former club, so he can have no excuses for being surprised by their quality. 

'I already knew the opponent's predisposition so I was expecting a game like this,' he added. 'I'd rather like to control it better in more aspects.

'However, I think Celta tried to create lots [of] chances, but not that many, two of them were pretty clear and the last one was due to our last minute pressing.

'They are a very difficult team to play against, but despite this we have created 19 shots, nine on goal, four hit the posts. So, even if we have had some mistakes and things to rectify I want to point out some values, mainly the players' faith and their attitude.'
