aquarium would spiral all the way from a swimming pool, bar and cinema 
in the basement to the master bedroom

It is hard to imagine something as soothing as a fish tank leading to anything except relaxation.

But football star Thierry Henry’s dream of owning a 40ft-high, four-storey home for his fish has left him in hot water with his famous neighbour, Tom Conti.

The problem is that the ex-Arsenal striker’s plan involves demolishing his £6million North London house and   building a taller property to incorporate the massive aquarium.

Celebrity battle: Footballer Thierry Henry, left has been urged by neighbour Tom Conti, right,
to move out of his £6 million London home rather than demolish it for a 
larger house to accommodate a monster 40ft fish tank

Flash home: Conti, whose garden backs on to Henry's home, and seven others have urged planning officials halt the proposal saying 'If someone wants a larger house why do they not just buy one somewhere else?'

Plans: Henry intends to rebuild his Hampstead home, although the original architect Sir Richard MacCormac is opposed to the demolition

Conti is so annoyed by the prospect of months of construction work that he questioned why Henry did not just move somewhere else instead.

The 70-year-old actor, best known for his portrayal of Greek taverna owner Costas in the film Shirley Valentine, told the Daily Mail yesterday: ‘They’ll be drilling into the basement and it’ll go on for months and months.

‘There are a lot of retired people round here or people like me who work from home – I write – and it’s a terrible disturbance.

‘Why do they have to knock it down? I’ve never met Thierry Henry and I’ve got nothing against the man at all. I’m sure he’s a very nice man and he’s welcome to build whatever he likes. But please not here, not next to me, with all the noise.’

Conti added: ‘This used to be a wonderful place to live, but in the last ten years there’s been endless, endless building.’

Thierry Henry's new house plan has angered his neighbour

The row in leafy, normally liberal Hampstead has been brewing since February, when French footballer Henry, 34, applied for planning permission.

Made up of four separate containers, one for each storey of the house, his  proposed £250,000 tank would take 5,500 gallons of water to fill, house 300 fish and cost £12,000 a year to run, making the super-size aquariums owned by the likes of Madonna, the Beckhams and Premier League footballer Stephen  Ireland look like tiddlers.

Henry bought his house in 2001 when he was married to model Claire Merry. The couple divorced in 2007 and the footballer now plays for the New York Red Bulls in the US.

 The French footballer – who fronted 
the ‘va-va-voom’ TV adverts for car firm Renault – is the latest in a 
long line of celebrities to take an interest in flashy fish tanks.

Madonna, the Beckhams, Cher and 
Premier League footballers Stephen Ireland, Joe Hart and Micah Richards, have all splashed out on opulent fish tanks.

Ireland has reportedly spent more 
than £100,000 on his 13ft aquarium, and is now believed to be planning a
shark tank under his kitchen floor.

It has been suggested that the celebrity obsession with aquariums may not be just about a fondness for fish.

One tank designer, who asked not to be
named, said: ‘Our client list tends to be male-dominated and they are 
looking for status symbols and showpieces.’

But he is understood to be keen to maintain his London base to be close to their young daughter, Tea. His new home would also include a swimming pool and gym.

Conti, who appears in summer Batman blockbuster The Dark Knight Rises, lives with his actress wife Kara, 67, in a six-bedroom Edwardian property whose garden backs on to Henry’s home.

When they bought the house in 1985 it was divided into flats and they turned it into a family home. Built in 1902, it includes a small ballroom and minstrels’ gallery.

Councillors were meeting last night to discuss Henry’s application, which planning officials have recommended they grant.

Henry argues that his house, built in 1999, has aged badly and is not fit for purpose as a family home.

‘Its interior spaces are cramped, deteriorated and commercial in feel, with low ceilings, narrow rooms and poor daylight,’ according to papers submitted to the council by Montagu Evans, the agents acting on his behalf.

The house’s original architect, Sir Richard MacCormac, a former chairman of the Royal Institute of British Architects, opposes Henry’s application.

He says the house has ‘good daylighting and is in good condition but appears not to have been well maintained’.

Conti told the council in a letter: ‘The existing dwelling overlooks our house and garden, particularly in winter, but was thoughtfully designed with few windows.

‘A taller building with windows facing our property would be a great intrusion of privacy.’

In total, eight neighbours have urged planners to kick Henry’s proposal into touch.

One expressed concern that ‘a property that was built 13 years ago, in decent condition, is being demolished to create another eyesore in the conservation area’.

Influential civic group the Heath and Hampstead Society also called for the application to be thrown out, saying the design of the new house ‘has no style or elegance’.
