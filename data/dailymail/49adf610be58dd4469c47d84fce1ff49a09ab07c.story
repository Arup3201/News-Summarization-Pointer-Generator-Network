Los Angeles has a plan to save its fading movie and television industries.

That’s right, the entertainment industry in Los Angeles is fading. With most big-budget films and television shows now being filmed on location outside of Tinsletown as they gobble up tax credits elsewhere, newly elected mayor Eric Garcetti wants to expand the state’s incentive program and create the position of film czar in an effort to keep entertainment industry employment from falling any further into a state of 'emergency.'

Of this summer’s highest-budget films, Iron Man 3 was shot in North Carolina, The Lone Ranger in New Mexico and Utah, and the Great Gatsby was shot in Australia, according to Variety. The state’s share of hour-long network dramas fell from 89 per cent in 2005 to only 39 per cent last year.

Tinseltown landmark: Though the Hollywood sign is still there, many of the entertainment industry jobs it looked over have disappeared from Los Angeles

Big and small-screen productions fleeing to locations with higher tax incentives have caused production and other industry-related positions in Los Angeles to drop from a high of over 136,000 in 1997 to just under 116,000 in 2011, according to Variety. That number is up from a low of just over 94,000 though, which was during a recession.

This loss in jobs doesn’t just affect the people in the industry it also has an impact on support business such as equipment suppliers and caterers, Garcetti told Variety. This, in turn causes a trickle-down effect that hurts the economy as a whole, leading to what Garcetti calls an 'emergency.'

Man with a plan: Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti wants to expand tax credits to the industry to save jobs

Over 40 states, Australia, Canada and the UK now offer credits that are chipping away at Hollywood’s bread and butter.

The state’s current incentive program is limited, but popular, according to Variety. In order to qualify for incentives, a movie must have a budget between $1million and $75million, small beans compared to the $200million blockbusters filming elsewhere.

Despite this, it has been so popular a lottery system has been set up to fairly dole out the credits. This too has been met with criticism, with producers complaining the uncertainty makes it harder to budget features, according to Variety.

Old school: movies are increasingly filmed on-location and less on sound stages in lots owned by large studios

The first step to solving this problem, Garcetti told assembled media short

ly after he was elected, is appoint a movie czar similar to what New York has between city hall and the industry. This would help producers cut through all the red tape and get to work sooner, Garcetti argued.

The mayor also believes the tax credit program should be expanded, but not given a blank check.

‘It is not in some people’s interest to see California win,’ Garcetti told the magazine, adding ‘they may benefit from this competition being in as many places as possible, because it has been a race to the bottom. And I certainly won’t lead a race to the bottom.’

Garcetti believes that the state’s $100million tax incentive program isn’t enough, but it shouldn’t be unlimited, he told Variety. New York has a program just over $400million, Variety noted.

Symbolic: Garcetti fears that the city's title of 'movie capital of the world' will largely become symbolic if something is not done

Incentives: Garcetti believes a film czar, like the one employed in New York, and tax credits will lure movies and television dramas back to Tinsletown

The sometimes actor – Garcetti played the mayor of Los Angeles in a few episodes of ‘The Closer’ before he was actually elected to the job – argues that for every $70million spent on tax incentives, $5billion in economic activity is created. Those numbers come from the worst-performing study, Garcetti noted to Variety.

‘Some studies have shown, at worst, some small debit to the state treasury, which is then multiplied many times over in economic activity,’ said Garcetti.

Another idea would be to provide credits to commercial shoots. Though not the big-time productions movies and television shows require, they would at least preserve the infrastructure and the jobs, according to Garcetti.

A $15million bill for those incentives stalled in the California State House earlier this year.

‘We are going to fight a lot of fights,’ Garcetti told the magazine. ‘I know we are not going to win every single one of them. But if we don’t put a lot of strength toward winning a couple of battles in this war, we are just going to continue to be left behind on the battlefield.’
