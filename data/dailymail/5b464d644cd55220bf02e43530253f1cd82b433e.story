Two former giants of the boxing world came face-to-face on Wednesday as Lennox Lewis took to Instagram to share a picture posing with Jake LaMotta.

LaMotta, a former world middleweight champion in the 1940s and 50s, posed with Lewis, who later shared the picture on the social media site.

Lewis, himself a former world champion in the heavyweight division, was holding what appeared to be one of 93-year-old LaMotta's belts from his boxing days.

'Me and Jake "The Raging Bull" LaMotta #Legend,' Lewis wrote on Instagram.

The Raging Bull was LaMotta's boxing nickname and Robert de Niro later played the Italian New Yorker in a 1980 movie of the same name.

On the same day Lewis, once famous for his dreadlocks, revealed to his followers that he had visited a barbers in New York for a trim.
