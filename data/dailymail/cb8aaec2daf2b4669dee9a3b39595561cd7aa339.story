Chelsea Clinton and her newborn daughter Charlotte have been met with an outpouring of congratulations on social media.

But not everyone was pleased at the prospect of a new Clinton entering the world.

Chelsea, 34, gave birth to her daughter - Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky - just after 7pm on Friday evening in Manhattan, and yesterday shared the first family photo showing her, the baby and proud father Marc Mezvinsky, 36.

The news was met with joy as the new mother, who announced the birth via Twitter, was inundated with messages, including from some political big beasts.

New York mayor Bill de Blasio was quick off the mark with his congratulation - giving the new mother his 'welcome to parenthood' and noting the fact that the newest member of the Clinton political tribe was born in his city.

The Democrats' official Twitter account also chimed in with its own congratulation, prompting other supporters to show their love by re-posting the message.

New grandparents Bill and Hillary Clinton also joined the celebration, posting their own pictures of themselves cooing over the baby, and declaring themselves 'over the moon.'

But the tone of some messages was very different - with one Conservative blogger posting a mocking picture implying the newborn would be buck-toothed and ugly.

An account dubbed Paul Revere - a figure from the American Revolution - mockingly posted a 'first pic of Chelsea's baby'. 

And the New York Post newspaper joined in, using the birth as a way to attack Bill Clinton, and describing Charlotte as 'another liberal crybaby'.

Although President Obama's social media accounts were silent on the birth, he had previously joked that if Chelsea went into labor during a speech for the Clinton Foundation last week he could borrow his motorcade to make it to the hospital more quickly.

One of his senior aides, Valerie Jarrett, did speak up, however, saying 'There's no greater gift than being a mom'.

Bill and Hillary Clinton today made a second visit to Chelsea at the Lenox Hill hotel in the Upper East Side of Manhattan, smiling and waving to cameras as they made their way in.
