Naomi Broady will go into her second round clash with Caroline Wozniacki on Wednesday without the support of the Lawn Tennis Association — the issue having caused a deep rift in her family.

Her father Simon has not spoken for nearly two years to her brother Liam, a former Wimbledon junior finalist now trying to make his way as a fully-fledged professional.

Naomi’s exclusion from LTA support and funding has been well-documented following her first round win over Timea Babos.

Father Simon was so enraged with the governing body’s over-reaction seven years ago to some harmless pictures on social media of a night out, that he cut off all contact with them.

Simon, who did not respond to attempts to contact him on Tuesday, has long believed that the best way to achieve success in tennis is to not be part of any official system.

He also kept Liam, at the time one of the Britain’s brightest juniors, away from any dealings with the LTA and sold his house to help fund his children’s careers.

Having coached his son to some junior success, he fell out with Liam when his son decided to accept funding and coaching support from the governing body. They have been estranged ever since.

Recently, Liam, 20, said: ‘I am quite a stubborn person and so is my dad.’ Liam is now based in London, where he trains out of the National Tennis Centre at Roehampton.

After making the boys’ Wimbledon singles final in 2011 and winning the doubles title in 2010, he has made it to No 392 in the main world rankings.

Competing in small Futures level events in America to develop his game, Liam is currently playing a tournament in Rochester, New York.

He did not wish to comment on Tuesday but emphasised that he is on good terms with his sister and delighted for her.
