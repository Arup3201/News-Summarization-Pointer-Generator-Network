Former Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson is expected to go head to head with his possible replacement Chris Evans as the two bid on items in the UK's largest private car collection.

After recently discovering he may have a little more time on his hands, Clarkson is said to be among motoring enthusiasts that will bid on items in the collection of 150 cars, 60 motorbikes, a gyrocopter and even a Soviet rocket launcher.

Radio 2 DJ Chris Evans could also be bidding on the massive collection.

A Jowett, registriation: CPC 34 - this 30s classic was first registered in the UK on the 1st January 1935. The oldest car put up for auction dates back to the 1920s with the newest a Citroen 2CV from 1986

While the disc jockey has emphatically ruled out taking the helm of Top Gear, there may be little love lost between the two presenters.

Puncturing rumours he had been offered the top job on the BBC cash-cow, Evans did say he saw no reason the popular motoring show should not carry on without Clarkson.

Evans said Clarkson's co-presenters James May  and Richard Hammond had more than enough charisma to carry the show on their own. May is believed to have been in talks with the BBC's creative director Alan Yentob but also appeared recently online in videos he posted of himself playing the recorder, alongside mundane tweets using the hashtag #stillunemployed.

Clarkson, Evans and 2,000 other motoring enthusiasts will be bidding on the auction of, among other lots, the collection's most sought after item, an Aston Martin Lagonda.

Amid the Army tanks, fire engines, old buses and more than 60 vintage motorbikes also being put up for sale there is also a lot of interest in an East German Trabant, reputedly the worst car ever made.

The collection, which fills eight halls at a museum, belonged to the late green house entrepreneur John Saunders.

Auctioneer James Dennison said: 'For anyone who likes Top Gear - this is their ultimate playground.'

'It is the most amazing collection - there's something here for everyone who likes cars.

'But there's also Rolls Royce jet turbine engine, an original gypsy Romany caravan and a replica of Stevenson's rocket.

There will be no reserve on any of the lots, Dennison explained, adding that it really is a case of 'everything must go'.

John Saunder's son Chris, 61, said Clarkson was likely to attend 'There is a lot here to get Top Gear fans excited - I wouldn't be surprised if Jeremy Clarkson is at the auction.'

He added: 'My dad loved every one of the pieces in his museum.

'It started with just one car but became what we believe is the largest private collection of automobiles in the country.

The collection contains a Soviet era Scud missile launcher. The late owner decided he needed to pick one up when the cold war ended

'My dad was fascinated by all sorts of weird and wonderful things.

'I remember telling him that a lot of Soviet military hardware was being sold off in the nineties and I came home to see a 40ft rocket launcher had been added to his collection.

The museum is to close after Mr Saunders died two years ago and because the lease is due up on the museum site.

'We have spent many happy years amassing the collection but the care and maintenance of the vehicles was getting a bit much.

'The number of visitors has fallen but ironically as soon as we announced we are closing we have been busier than ever.'

The value of the entire Sanders collection is expected to run into several million pounds although the family say they have not sat down and put an overall value on it.

The oldest car put up for auction dates back to the 1920s with the newest is a Citroen 2CV from 1986.

The collection will be sold over three separate auction days in April, May and June
