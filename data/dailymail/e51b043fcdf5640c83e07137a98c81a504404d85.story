A war veteran who had part of his leg blown off in Afghanistan was evicted from his house for running a crack house.

Lee Harvey, who was injured in a bomb blast and lost the back of his thigh, was evicted after neighbours complained that he had made their lives 'impossible', playing loud music, holding parties frequently and inviting drug users into his home in the quiet residential street in Doffcocker, Bolton.

Police raided his home on September 7 and found cocaine along with a credit card and a rolled up £20 note. Harvey was arrested and accepted a caution.

For the first time in Bolton, a closure order for a privately owned house was imposed on his house at Bolton Magistrates’ Court yesterday after police and Bolton Council took him to court under crackhouse closure laws.

Police officers then boarded up the property with shutters to stop anyone entering the house for the next three months.

The court heard that Harvey had died on the operating table for five minutes but medics managed to save him.

Found at home: Police found cocaine along with a credit card and a rolled up £20 note at Harvey's house. He was arrested and accepted a caution

'Made life impossible': After the raid, a neighbour told Bolton Magistrates' Court that Harvey played loud music and burning cigarettes were allegedly thrown, damaging his conservatory roof, making life 'impossible'

He was medically discharged from the army where he was part of the parachute regiment but did however suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder which caused him to drink heavily and use drugs occasionally, the court heard.

He also told the court that he lost some of his hearing as a result of the bomb blast.

Next-door neighbour John Falch told the court of several incidents which occurred over the last year.

Mr Falch said he spent thousands of pounds on his home trying to block out the loud bass music Mr Harvey allegedly played. He said he asked Harvey to turn the music down which he did at first, before allegedly ignoring later pleas for quiet.

Mr Falch kept a diary of incidents and said that his conservatory roof had been damaged by burning cigarettes allegedly being thrown onto it. He also claimed that human excrement had also been thrown on the roof one day.

First time: Police prepare to shut up Harvey's house after a closure order was put on Harvey's house for three months, the first privately owned house in the area to have such restrictions

Mr Falch, who has lived on the street for 15 years, said: ‘This has made life impossible. 

‘I no longer feel like it’s my house, I feel like it belongs to him because the invasion into my property is constant. 

‘There are no words I can use to describe what it has done to us.’

Harvey
moved into the house in April 2011 with some savings but within days of
moving in, he caused problems, neighbours claimed.

Lingering injury: Harvey lost the back of his thigh in the bomb blast in Afghanistan, where the conflict continues with recent riots (pictured), and suffered from post-traumatic stress causing him to drink heavily and use drugs occasionally

He said: ‘When I moved in I was a bit of a fool, drinking and playing music but Mr Falch has tried to make me look worse. 

‘I rarely take cocaine. I have learned my lesson now.’

Chairman of the bench, Norman Morlidge, said the closure was necessary to prevent disorder and serious nuisance to the public. 

He said: ‘We have to consider the effect on the lives of people living in Delph Hill Close, many of whom have supplied statements explaining the impact on their lives.’
