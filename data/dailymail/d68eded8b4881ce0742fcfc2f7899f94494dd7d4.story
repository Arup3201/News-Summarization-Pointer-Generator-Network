Footage has emerged of the horrifying moment a mother and son were killed when they were hit by a speeding patrol car as family members of the pair were given $570,000 in compensation.

City insurers paid the sum to relatives of Myra Meyer, 82, and her son Brian Wichmann, 60, who were killed in July 2011 when a police car chasing a speeding motorist with its siren switched off crashed into their vehicle.

New Ulm Police officer Matthew Rasmussen was reportedly travelling at least 70mph in a 30mph zone when he hit Ms Meyer's car.

The shocking video shows the officer's car overtake a slower car in front before his pathway becomes seemingly clear as another car ahead pulls off to take a left turn.

Officer Rasmussen seems to have a clear path and builds speed to catch up with the speeding motorist.

But Ms Meyer's silver Mercury Sable suddenly comes into view on the other side of the road. The car banks left as it begins to turn off into a side road, but seeing the speeding patrol car, tries to swerve out of the way, to no avail.

The impact seems to send Rasmussen's car spinning almost 180 degrees before it comes to a halt in a haze of smoke.

Although the case went to a grand jury in January last year, no criminal charges were brought against officer Rasmussen.

But Ms Meyer's three surviving children sued the city claiming that the officer was negligent.

Lawyers acting on behalf of the city had tried to mount a defense that blamed Ms Meyer, who was turning left into her nearby home when the crash happened.

But Peter Riley, acting for her children said that they don't believe she was at fault.

The officer had said that he kept his emergency lights on throughout the pursuit and that they were turned off when the power was interrupted in the collision.

But several witnesses claim that the emergency lights were not switched on.

While Mr Wichmann died at the scene, Ms Meyer didn't die until July 18 after 10 days of treatment at the Hennepin County Medical Center

One of Ms Meyer's children, Dana Wichmann, 59, has since set up a website in the hope that the authorities will be investigated over their handling of the crash.

He told the NU Journal: 'I don't believe justice has been served. I think it's some cowboy cop and they're trying to cover it up.

'It's nice to have money but I'd rather have truth and justice.'

The settlement included no admission of wrongdoing, reported the Mankato Free Press.
