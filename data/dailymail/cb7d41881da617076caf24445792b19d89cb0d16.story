The UK's smallest chapel is believed to have been found - purely by chance.

The seven-foot-wide and 10-foot-long building is believed to date back to the eighth or ninth century.

But Bill Devereux did not know he was the owner until he was painstakingly restoring Wilderness Millhouse in Gresford, near Wrexham, north Wales, which he bought 20 years ago.

Tiny discovery: Bill Devereux found the tiny chapel when he was tidying up land near Wrexham in north Wales

The 66-year-old was clearing rubble away from a bank when he was astonished to discover the ancient, tiny place of worship buried low down near the house in Gresford, near Wrexham, north Wales.

And he believes it could even be the 'lost' St Leonard of Glyn Chapel, whose precise location has been a mystery to archaeologists for years.

Mr Devereux said: 'It took a while to get people round here to see it, but [historic monuments body] Cadw have been to inspect it and said it is one of the best preserved chapels they have ever seen. They have made it a designated ancient monument.

'We think it dates back to the eighth or ninth century.

'The house was built in 1420 and would have been built at ground level at that time.

'The chapel has been built at a level a lot lower than that.

'The property had been burned down before I bought it 20 years ago and I've been restoring it. The chapel had been buttressed in on either side, so the first I saw of it was the roof at floor level and thought it was a really strange structure.

'I knew it was important, special, religious, with a deeper meaning. I see myself as a custodian, to make sure it isn't damaged, and want it saved for another 600 years.'

Mr Devereux said he is ready to invite the public to view the chapel.

He said: 'I want it to be sympathetically used, so if a practising Christian group want to hold services here, or anyone wants to visit, they can get in contact - I am happy to share, as long as they let me know they are coming beforehand.'

Details about the St Leonard of Glyn chapel are vague.

According to the Caer Alyn Archaeological and Heritage project website, as far back as 1254, one of the clergy who assessed the parishes of the Deanery of Maelor for taxation was one 'John de St Leonardi'.

It is only through documentary evidence that anything is known at all about the medieval chapel of St Leonard's; the precise site of the building is still a mystery and the extant documents give very few clues, but it is believed to have been located on the west bank of the Alyn.

The last mention of the chapel in the public records was in 1507 where it is apparently referred to as in 'Llai', and near the River Alyn.

Phil Cox, of the Caer Alyn Archaeological and Heritage Project, said: 'We have done 13 years of research on that land and all the documents tend to put St Leonard's where Bill's chapel is, so it could be associated with it, have some connection, but possibly not be the actual chapel itself.

'It is certainly medieval so the dates are in line.'

Two other churches that have previously claimed the distinction of being the UK's smallest chapel are St Trillo's in Rhos on Sea and Bremilham Church in Wiltshire.
