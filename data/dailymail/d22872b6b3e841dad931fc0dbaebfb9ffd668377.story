Yohan Cabaye has left Newcastle’s base in Norfolk to complete his £23million move to Paris St Germain.

The France international has said his final farewells to his Newcastle team-mates, including close friend Mathieu Debuchy, after the French club offered a deal, with add-ons, which is closer to owner Mike Ashley’s valuation.

Cabaye is expected in the French capital at lunchtime for a medical and to agree and finalise personal terms.

Worry: Alan Pardew admits he is not confident of keeping Yohan Cabaye at Newcastle

On form: Cabaye has been outstanding for Newcastle in recent weeks

The former Lille player, who joined 
Newcastle for just £4.5million, pushed through the move which comes five
 months after he went on strike when Arsenal’s bid was turned down. He 
told manager Alan Pardew after training yesterday that he was keen to 
move back to France.

His 
departure is a blow to Pardew, whose side face Norwich City and former 
manager Chris Hughton tonight, before they take on Sunderland in the 
Tyne-Wear derby on Saturday lunchtime.

Pardew
 and chief scout Graham Carr now have until Friday to find a replacement
 for Cabaye, who has been their outstanding player this season after 
returning to the side following the closure of the August transfer 
window. They are also hoping to complete a deal to bring in Holland 
striker Luuk de Jong.

Joe Kinnear

Yohan Cabaye's imminent move to Paris Saint Germain for a fee of £23million is at odds with a statement made by Newcastle's director of football Joe Kinnear on January 20th.

Kinnear insisted that the France international would not be leaving St James's Park after earlier interest from Arsenal and the big spending Ligue 1 club.

'I will not let any player leave Newcastle United in this transfer window,' said Kinnear only eight days ago.

Montpellier’s
 midfielder Remy Cabella remains the favourite to join Newcastle and, 
despite the opposition of their owner Louis Nicollin, could now be 
convinced to move to the North East.

The
 loss of Cabaye will also be felt by Newcastle supporters who had 
recognised the influence of the France international in a new role in 
the side.

His decision to 
go on strike on the eve of the new season was misguided to say the 
least, but he recovered his relationship with supporters who regularly 
sang his name with the best form of his Newcastle career.

Rumours
 of PSG’s interest may have surfaced before their game at West Ham a 
fortnight ago, but Cabaye scored two at Upton Park in arguably one of 
his best performances of the season.

Ashley’s
 decision to sell one of his favourite players comes down to business 
and nearly £20million profit for a 28-year-old is too good to turn down.
 But it is derby week. The timing could be better.

Unlike the sale of Andy Carroll, which led to the signing of Shefki Kuqi, Newcastle have time to find a replacement.

Supporters will just be hoping that Ashley has the will and desire after a quiet summer. Because he certainly has the money.
