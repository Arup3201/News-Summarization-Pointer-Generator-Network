Darren McGregor says Rangers’ players can’t use the latest bout of turmoil at Ibrox as an excuse for failure.

Facing a trip to Cowdenbeath in their quest to peg back Hearts in the Championship, preparations were interrupted by news of caretaker manager Kenny McDowall’s resignation in midweek.

Just weeks after Ally McCoist was placed on gardening leave, McDowall’s decision added to the steady drip of negativity enveloping a dressing room where players can’t even be certain they will be paid on schedule next week.

‘We could sit here and go: “The gaffer’s gone and now Kenny might be going, the off-field antics”, you could write a big massive list,’ said defender McGregor, ‘but at the end of the day what’s the point?

‘We’re getting paid to play football and to win matches so that’s what we need to concentrate on.

‘I’d be lying if I said that sometimes it doesn’t swirl around in the back of your head. Of course it does because it’s human nature, but you try and block it out as much as you can and get on with your job.

‘Obviously, it was a bit of a body blow, but you just deal with it. Kenny came in on Tuesday and we had a wee discussion about it and cleared the air and that’s it, you move on. We trained as normal.

‘In any walk of life you get ups and downs and football is no different. In football it’s maybe intensified a bit. Over the past year or so here it’s maybe intensified, too, because of what’s happened on and off the park. I just concentrate on the objective which is to win on a Saturday and everything else you just put the blinkers on.’

A former Cowdenbeath player, McGregor knows what to expect in Fife this afternoon. What no one can predict with any real accuracy is the impact McDowall’s departure will have on a Rangers team already playing catch-up with Hearts.

Dismissing suggestions players will ease off the pedal after learning their manager has no plans to hang around, McGregor insisted: ‘Definitely not. It’s not in my character. I’m pretty sure with the group of boys we have in that dressing room, that’s not going to be the case. If anything, we’ll be pressing harder on the pedal just to try and prove a point knowing other people have been thinking we’ll falter.

‘It might make it a wee bit more difficult, but coming to a club like Rangers, it’s difficult at the best of times, so you just get on with it.’

Beyond Cowdenbeath, the latest indignities to strike the club could hardly be described as the perfect preparation for a League Cup semi-final against Celtic next weekend.

‘I can agree with that,’ said McGregor, ‘but we can only control what’s in our spectrum, turning up and applying ourselves in training and in games. Everything else we need to block it out like the professionals we are. You need to block out the negativity. You can probably use it for motivation or just totally ignore it and I tend to do that.

‘If you look for faults and pessimism, you’ll find it. For me, I just get on with it. We had Tuesday and Wednesday with Kenny and our day off yesterday, so nothing was discussed. It’s just one of these things. I totally respect how the gaffer is feeling, but we still have a job to do and I’m sure he’ll be no different. When he crosses the line in training he’ll still be the Kenny we know.’
