A mother has warned the medication she takes for her depression has ruined her ability to orgasm – and is now speaking publicly about her experiences of getting it back.

U.S. blogger Crista Anne switched antidepressants last year and discovered she was unable to reach climax through masturbation.

Experts warn that a delay in the ability to orgasm is a common side-effect of many antidepressants, faced by up to half the people who take them.

Crista, a mother-of-three, is now sharing intimate details of her sex life online in order to raise awareness to the side effects of antidepressants.

U.S. blogger Crista Anne (pictured) has warned the medication she takes to treat her depression has ruined her ability to orgasm. Around half of all antidepressant users experience this effect, an expert has said

Crista has been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, generalised anxiety and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Over the years she has tried various treatments including supplements, diets, lifestyle behaviours and the most widely prescribed antidepressants known Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs).

Last year she switched antidepressants and began taking amitriptyline, an older antidepressant which is no longer used as a first-line treatment.

It is thought to block the effects of two chemical messengers called serotonin and norepinephrine, regulating mood and controlling depression.

But writing on her blog, Crista says while the medication allows her to 'feel alive for the first time', she began to experience side effects such as sleepiness, a dry mouth and the inability to orgasm.

She found ways to cope with the dry mouth and sleepiness, but found the lack of orgasm – or anorgasmia, as it is known medically – a bigger problem.

She said on her blog: 'After an IUD [contraceptive coil] installation and starting medications for fibromyalgia and an antidepressant, my orgasm disappeared briefly.

'At the time of recording, with partnered sex I was missing my explosive orgasm. Only experiencing gentle waves.

Anorgasmia - the inability to orgasm - is a known side effect of some antidepressants. Crista has blogged about her experiences of anorgasmia, and wants to raise awareness to this side effect

'While those waves were nice, they were nothing close to the restorative experience I so depend on for a mental, emotional and physical recharge.'

‘A few weeks later I can blissfully report that universe creating powerhouse orgasms have returned via partnered sex.

‘The bad news is that orgasm via masturbation is still gone. Nada. Nil. Nothing.’

She has started a project called #OrgasmQuest, in which she aims to achieve one self-induced orgasm a day, with the hope of regaining her ability to climax through masturbation long term.

She tweets updates of whether she has been able to achieve orgasm, to break down stigma. For example:

In her first #OrgasmQuest blog post she describes how being able to orgasm on her own has always helped her battle her depression.

She said: 'Masturbating is my zen. It’s my meditation. It’s almost my religion. Masturbation is part of my identity, a part that I am not about to give up on.

‘My high sex drive and orgasmic superpower have been the most dependable parts of my identity.

'Sex has been my go-to pick me up for combating depression, allowing myself to feel something other than the darkness. Until now.'

Anorgasmia, or the inability to orgasm, is a common side effect of antidepressants.

It is not completely clear why some people experience anorgasmia while taking the drugs. 

David Taylor, professor of psychopharmacology at King's College London, said that in certain antidepressants, the same mechanism that regulates mood delays the time it takes for a person to orgasm.

He told MailOnline: 'A number of antidepressants affect the way serotonin is made in the body

'Serotonin is a neurotransmitter - it takes a message from one nerve cell to another.

'So boosting its effects are able to treat depression. But it also delays time to orgasm.'

He explained that the neurotransmitters cling to nerve cells, one of which receptors is involved in orgasm.

'If you stimulate that serotonin receptor, it helps treat depression but it also delays the time to achieve climax,' he said.

'There's a drug of the same pharmacology that is marketed as a drug for premature ejaculation.'

However, he added that one of the characteristics of depression is sexual dysfunction, therefore when people lose their ability to orgasm it is difficult to tell if it is due to depression or the antidepressant.

Anorgasmia as a side effect of antidepressants is extremely common, David Taylor, professor of psychopharmacology at King's College London, told MailOnline.

He said almost half of people who take antidepressants experience this side effect. 

Globally, more than 350 million people of all ages suffer from depression, according to WHO figures.

In 2011, a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  identified about 11 per cent of people took antidepressants - a 400 per cent increase since the 1980s when previous surveys were taken.

In the UK, recent government figures revealed more than 50 million prescriptions for antidepressants were issued in England last year.

A 2013 study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found 4 million people in the UK take SSRIs.

Crista says she has already tried a wide range of treatments for depression, and does not want to stop taking amitriptyline.

Writing on her blog, she said: 'The anorgasmia is not enough to make me want to get off this medication or try another, as I believe that I can work through and return to some sort of orgasmic state. My libido has not been affected.'

She wants to raise awareness to this problem as there is a stigma associated with discussing sexuality in public.

This means means many people taking antidepressants might suffer in silence, she says.

'When people bring up that their medication is hurting their sex life, most people seem to experience a complete dismissal that sexuality changes are important,' she told the Daily Dot.

'While my doctor spoke to me in depth about it, the stories I get from hundreds of other people are horrific.'

One woman says multiple partners have left her because of her ability to orgasm.

Professor Taylor explains that in certain antidepressants, the same mechanism that regulates mood delays the time it takes for a person to orgasm.

He told MailOnline: 'A number of antidepressants affect the way serotonin is made in the body

'Serotonin is a neurotransmitter - it takes a message from one nerve cell to another.

'When people bring up that their medication is hurting their sex life, most people seem to experience a complete dismissal that sexuality changes are important,' Crista said. She believes there is a stigma about talking about orgasm in public, which prevents people taking antidepressants getting help

'So boosting its effects are able to treat depression.

'But it also delays time to orgasm.'

He added that the neurotransmitters cling to nerve cells, one of which receptors is involved in orgasm.

'If you stimulate that serotonin receptor, it helps treat depression but it also delays the time to achieve climax,' he said.

'There's a drug of the same pharmacology that is marketed as a drug for premature ejaculation.'

However, he added that one of the characteristics of depression is sexual dysfunction, therefore when people lose their ability to orgasm it is difficult to tell if it is due to depression or the antidepressant.

Antidepressants are a type of medication used to treat depression or prevent it recurring.

They can also be used to prevent obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

It is thought antidepressants work by increasing levels of a group of chemicals in the brain called neurotransmitters. 

Certain neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and noradrenaline, can improve mood and emotion, although this process is not fully understood.

Increasing levels of neurotransmitters can also disrupt pain signals sent by nerves, which may explain why some antidepressants can help relieve long-term pain.

Some of the side effects of antidepressants include feeling sick, having a dry mouth, slight blurring of vision, constipation, dizziness, drowsiness, problems sleeping (insomnia) and sexual dysfunction, such as erectile dysfunction in men or difficulty achieving orgasm

Different antidepressants can have a range of different side effects. 

Some include feeling sick, having a dry mouth, slight blurring of vision, constipation, dizziness, drowsiness, problems sleeping (insomnia) and sexual dysfunction, such as erectile dysfunction in men or difficulty achieving orgasm.

And while antidepressants can help treat the symptoms of depression, they do not always address its causes. 

This is why they are usually used in combination with therapy to treat more severe depression or other mental health conditions caused by emotional distress.
