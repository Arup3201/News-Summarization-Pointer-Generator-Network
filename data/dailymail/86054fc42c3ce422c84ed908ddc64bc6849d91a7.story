This is the makeshift den under a railway bridge where a rapist hid from police while on the run.

Peter Lee Watton, 37, dragged a 44-year-old woman into woodland as she jogged with her dog in broad daylight just 48 hours after he was released early from prison.

Clutching a knife, the convicted kidnapper told her he had been watching her for weeks, before assaulting her for nine hours.

Hideout: Peter Lee Watton fashioned a camp out of a sleeping bag and camp fire in Wrexham, north Wales

After a nationwide manhunt, officers detected his fire and arrested him for kidnapping and raping a woman for nine hours in Handbridge, Chester, in broad daylight

But eventually, she managed to break free and seek refuge in a nearby cottage in Handbridge, Chester.

Watton fled as police launched a nationwide manhunt.

Six days later, he was found and arrested metres away from this camp under a railway bridge in North Wales.

Today he was was found guilty of 12 offences including false imprisonment, eight counts of rape, two counts of assault by penetration, and possession of a bladed article. He remains in custody awaiting sentence.

Detective Inspector Simon Lonsdale said: 'The bravery of the victim is extraordinary. I am humbled by her courage and determination which has enabled us to return a very dangerous man back to prison for a long time.

'Watton put the victim through a terrifying ordeal lasting several hours and had the audacity to claim the contact was consensual.

'Consequently the victim had to attend court and give evidence at the trial. Thankfully the jury saw through his lies and deceit and he will stay behind bars where he belongs.

'This case will obviously be very concerning to people, particularly in the Chester area, but I just want to stress that horrendous as it is, thankfully incidents like this are extremely rare for Cheshire as a whole'

The victim and her pet dog set off for their habitual afternoon jog along the tarmac path through the woods at about 3pm on Friday June 14, police said.

Watton was walking in the opposite direction and pushing a bicycle.

He spoke to the victim telling her to enjoy her run.

Moments later she was grabbed from behind and carried into the wooded area.

Watton initially had his face covered and threatened to harm the victim if she called out, telling her he had a knife and had been watching her for weeks.

He held the victim captive for several hours moving to different areas within the woods and subjecting her to repeated sexual assaults.

The victim knew that Watton was armed with a knife and was convinced that she would be killed.

He appeared to be moving her closer to the River Dee and she feared she would be thrown in, police said.

This is the road where the woman had been running at around 3pm on June 14 when Watton grabbed her

Eventually, at midnight, she saw lights and as Watton was distracted she ran to nearby houses.

She knocked on the door of a house and told the couple she had been attacked and raped.

They allowed her into their home where she called the police and told them the man had 'Pete' tattooed to his knuckles.

An immediate and intensive manhunt was launched.

On Thursday June 20, an off-duty Special Constable was travelling on a train from Chester to Birmingham when he spotted Watton walking on the railway tracks.

Hours later, a team of officers discovered his campfire, and Watton was arrested.
