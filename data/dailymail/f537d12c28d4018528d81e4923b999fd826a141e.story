Teachers have lost their ‘morality’ and are cheating in exams and coursework to boost pupils’ grades, an expert has claimed.

Professor Robert Coe said teachers were falling into ‘bad behaviour’ because they believed other schools were bending the rules.

It coincided with revelations that whistleblowers reported teachers for telling students what to write and completing coursework for them.

There are even claims of staff employing external consultants to finish projects.

Teachers have been attacked for cheating exams and coursework to boost their pupils' grades, amid growing pressure to boost grades

In a separate move, exams watchdog 
Ofqual this week opened an unprecedented anonymous online survey that 
urges teachers to report experiences of improper tactics or cheating.

The questions detail some 30 strategies thought to be used to boost 
results.

Professor Coe, an 
expert in exams at Durham University and an Ofqual adviser, said: ‘I 
think there is a big issue about morality here, professional morality 
and how we have lost sight of the bigger picture.

The Education Secretary Michael Gove came into office vowing to get a grip on falling examination standards

‘It
 is kind of [seen as] OK to do things you know are wrong because 
everyone else is doing them: “Because I need to for the sake of my 
school surviving Ofsted.”

'Bad behaviour drives out the good – if other 
people are doing it, it is much harder to resist,’ he told the 
Westminster Education Forum in London.

The
 former teacher also  suggested coursework marks could be capped 
according to pupils’ exam scores, the Times Educational Supplement said.

He called for more support for whistleblowers, saying: ‘When there is 
cheating, people know there is cheating. So why don’t they tell us about
 it?

'Partly because there are some strong incentives for them not to, 
but  also because there isn’t really a mechanism.’

Freedom
 of Information  disclosures show Ofqual has received 73 complaints from
 whistleblowers since April 2012, many about controlled assessments – 
coursework done under exam conditions in class.

The complaints range 
from inflated grades to altered marks in spoken exams.

One
 said pupils were ‘told what to write’ and another complained of 
‘inappropriate granting of extra time by the school’ during an A-level.

Children will be taught by computers for large parts of the day at a controversial new school.

Academy operator Ark is setting up a ‘blending learning’ school in London – where lessons are both online and with teachers.

The idea, which will help cut costs, will see pupils spending significant periods learning from computer software packages.

The school – to be known as the Ark Pioneer Academy – is expected to open in 2016 and is loosely based on a US scheme, which led to cuts in teacher numbers.

Christine Blower, of the National Union of Teachers, raised fears over possible job cuts and the loss of ‘quality education’.

Ark yesterday denied the initiative would lead to fewer teachers or bigger classes and said plans are at a very early stage.

A complaint headed ‘ICT’ alleged that an ‘external  consultant was employed to complete students’ work’.

Education
 Secretary Michael Gove’s GCSE and A-level reforms substantially reduce 
controlled assessments. But some subjects will still need coursework to 
test skills not assessed in written exams.

Ofqual
 will use its survey – which runs until July 18 – to cut out loopholes 
as it finalises the new-look exams.

It asks about practices such as 
pupils learning mark schemes, the ‘hot housing’ of borderline students, 
and giving ‘hints’.

Glenys 
Stacey, the head of Ofqual, said it had ‘heard increasingly . . . that 
certain approaches are used which create unfair advantages’.

Insisting
 the survey was ‘not condemnatory’, she said: ‘We want teachers to be 
open and honest with us . . . How much assistance are you going to give a
 child?

Is he going to memorise the mark scheme? Is that right, is it 
wrong?

'We don’t take a view but we’d like to have a discussion.’
