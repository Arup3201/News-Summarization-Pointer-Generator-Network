Toronto Mayor Rob Ford today claimed that rehab saved his life as he returned to work following nearly two months in rehab.

The beleaguered politician, 45, looked decidedly slimmer at the press conference as he apologized for his previous outbursts and drug use, and said he took full responsibility for his actions.

'Like a lot of people dealing with substance abuse, I was in complete denial,' he said at the press conference at City Hall. 'But soon it became obvious that my alcohol and drug use was having a serious impact on my family and on my health and on my job as mayor.

'After experiencing some of the darkest moments in my life, I decided that enough was enough. I had become my own worst enemy.'

Apologies: Toronto Mayor Rob Ford apologized for his actions on his first day back on the job following rehab

Do you think Rob Ford will relapse?

Ford said he underwent 'intensive therapy' and physical training at Greenstone rehab center in Bala, Ontario, where staff forced him to confront his 'personal demons'.

'I now know that the staff at Greenstone saved my life,' he said. 'Thanks to my treatment I can proudly say today that I have begun the process of taking control of my life.'

He continued: 'But folks, this is a long long road to recovery. No matter what I do, I will never be able to change the mistakes that I have made in the past.

'When I look back on some of the things I have said and some of the things I did when I was using, I am ashamed, embarrassed and humiliated. I was wrong and I have no one but no one to blame but myself. I want to sincerely apologize.'

Echoing earlier sentiments about wanting to run for re-election in November, Ford vowed to serve Toronto for 'many, many years'. 

Back to work: Toronto Mayor Rob Ford arrives at City Hall on Monday after nearly 2 months in rehab

Although he thanked his family, he did not mention his long-suffering wife Renata by name in the speech.

Ford, who said he will continue to undergo treatment, spoke shakily throughout the appearance and would not take any questions before he left the room.

He had 
entered the Greenestone facility in Ontario on May 1 to be treated for 
alcohol addition after announcing in April that he was seeking 
treatment.

He made the decision after another video surfaced that apparently showed him smoking crack; Ford
 admitted last year after reports of a similar video that he had smoked 
crack in a 'drunken stupor,' following months of denials.

He held Monday's press conference in his protocol office - a space that holds just 25 people - so only certain publications were invited, Ford’s communications director Amin Massoudi told the Star.

The venue meant that reporters from the
 national wire service The Canadian Press, Now Magazine and Toronto 
Community News are not welcome - and even the president of the city hall
 press gallery.

The decision allowed for yet another chapter in Ford's rocky relationship with the media.

City spokesperson Wynna Brown said the member's lounge, which is available, would have been more appropriate because it allows for more people.

'From a city point of view, this is not reflective of the approach or the collaborative relationships we have and value with members of the media, particularly our colleagues in the city hall press gallery,' she said.

Jonathan Goldsbie, a Now Magazine reporter who was left off the invite list, told the Sun he felt 'shock, anger, frustration and momentarily, disbelief' to have been left of the list.

'The 
decision to hold it in the protocol lounge is an entirely arbitrary one 
that offers no tangible benefit to the mayor or his staff,' he said.

David
 Nickle, president of the city hall press gallery and a reporter for the
 Toronto Community News, said the mayor has often limited the media's 
access, but never to news conferences.

'I feel the mayor should be facing all the Toronto media that are interested in hearing him,' he said.

Ford previously announced plans to launch his re-election campaign on July 1 - Canada Day.

Speaking to the Toronto Sun, he said: 'I will be back, I guarantee you. I am coming back and you will see a different Rob Ford.'

He said he felt 'great' and was benefiting from the self-imposed exile.

Treatment: Ford had entered the Greenestone facility in Ontario, pictured, in May and likened the experience to going to football camp as a youngster

'It
 reminds me of football camp. Kind of like the Washington Redskins camp I
 went to as a kid,' he said, adding 'I am working out every day and I am
 learning about myself, my past and things like that.'

But he said he was missing his family; the only time he had seen his wife and children was for a trip to Crabby Joe's on his birthday, and he added that he was anxious to get back to them.

On the subject of his addiction, he acknowledged that it was his own fault.

He said: 'No one has enabled me. We were talking about the enabling thing the other day in a meeting. You do booze or drugs because you want to do it. I take full responsibility. I have learned my lesson.'
