Sam Allardyce considers it the most inexperienced side he has ever put out in a competitive match - namely the West Ham United side full of teenagers who were demolished 5-0 by Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup third round last season.

Five of his starting XI were from the development squads and the seven on the bench, three of whom came on, were from there too.

West Ham were only one behind against the Championship side at the break - through Djamel Abdoun's penalty - but Jamie Paterson hit a 14-minute hat-trick from the 65th minute and Andy Reid finished off the humiliating defeat in stoppage time.

Hammers boss Allardyce admitted on Monday it was a 'dark, dark period' - especially as a 6-0 drubbing by Manchester City followed - before he finally sorted the side out and kept them up. It almost cost him his job.

But what happened to the 12 youngsters who had their confidence crushed that Sunday afternoon? Sportsmail investigates...

THOSE WHO STARTED...

Danny Whitehead, 21, midfielder

The hammering by Forest has not stopped Whitehead gaining more first-team experience. In July last year he appeared in senior pre-season friendlies against Stevenage, Wellington Pheonix and Sydney FC. Whitehead is playing in the development squad at the moment but is yet to feature for West Ham in a senior competitive tie since the Forest match.

Sebastian Lletget, 22, midfielder

The American attacking midfielder, who was the first product of West Ham's international academy to sign a professional deal, scored three times in 19 appearances for the development squad last season, which earned him a place in the first team for pre-season friendlies against Ipswich Town and Schalke in July. Also yet to play for the senior team again in a competitive match.

George Moncur, 21, midfielder

Moncur, son of former Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham midfielder John Moncur, was shipped out on loan to Partick three weeks after the defeat by Forest. Then he went on loan to Colchester United at the start of this season before making the move permanent in November, signing a contract until 2017. He has scored four times in 28 games.

Dan Potts, 20, defender

This game didn't do Potts, whose father Steve Potts came through the academy at West Ham and made more than 400 appearances for the club, any harm and he signed a new two-year deal last summer. He has played for the senior side this campaign when he started in West Ham's Capital One Cup defeat by Sheffield United, which they lost on penalties.

Callum Driver, 22, defender

That match against Forest would be the only appearance Driver would ever make for the club. He was released last summer and briefly joined Conference South side Whitehawk, before being released in October and joining Conference team Dartford in November. He has made eight league appearances for them.

Callum Driver's FA Cup match was his only game for West Ham before his release last summer

THE SUBS WHO CAME ON...

Blair Turgott, 20, midfielder

(Came on for Stewart Downing in the 64th minute)

Went out on loan to Rotherham United 12 days after the defeat, where he spent two months, but only managed one substitute appearance, then finished the season at League Two Dagenham & Redbridge, where he played five times. In 2011 the winger played alongside Raheem Sterling for England Under 17s when they reached the World Cup quarter-finals. He is playing for West Ham's Under 21 side this season.

Reece Burke, 18, defender

(Came on for Moncur in the 55th minute)

Like Potts, the centre back has gone from strength to strength since that game. Last summer, he toured with the first team at the Schalke Cup where he played against Malaga and scored the winner in the Marathon Bet Cup 3-2 victory against UC Sampdoria. Burke also started in that defeat by Sheffield United at the start of the season.

Matthias Fanimo, 20, midfielder

(Came on for Alou Diarra in the 55th minute)

The winger continued to perform for the Under 21 side last season where he scored three times in 17 appearances. But that defeat was the last match he has featured in for the senior team to date. Fanimo, who joined West Ham aged six, moved to Tranmere Rovers on loan in September, but has made just one substitute appearance back in September in a 1-0 defeat by Carlisle United.

Matthias Fanimo came on against Forest and was loaned out to Tranmere Rovers earlier this season

THE SUBS WHO DIDN'T EVEN MAKE IT ON...

Raphael Spiegel, 22, goalkeeper

The towering goalkeeper, from Switzerland, is yet to play for West Ham. He spent six weeks on loan at Crawley Town last summer but did not make an appearance, then he spent a month at Barnet from November but only made one appearance after suffering an injury. He is back with West Ham.

Elliott Lee, 20, forward

The stocky striker, son of former England, West Ham, Charlton Athletic and Newcastle United midfielder Rob Lee, finished with a return of eight goals in 14 Under 21 games last season. He is currently on loan at League Two Southend United, where he has been since the end of October, but injury has prevented him from featuring. There have been high hopes for the forward since he made a substitute appearance in the Premier League in a 1-0 defeat to Stoke City when he was just 18.

Sean Maguire, 20, forward

Maguire is finding success on loan at Accrington Stanley, where he has netted four goals in 15 appearances since he moved in September. Maguire also played more than 20 first-team games on loan at League of Ireland Premier Division side Sligo Rovers last summer, including two Europa League matches against Rosenborg.

Jaanai Gordon, 19, forward

The forward had just signed for West Ham from Peterborough United on New Year's Day 2014, just 72 hours before that dreaded game. He was loaned to Conference South side Chelmsford City in December, where he has been on fire. Gordon scored on his debut against Ebbsfleet United, has netted five goals in four appearances and set up two more.
