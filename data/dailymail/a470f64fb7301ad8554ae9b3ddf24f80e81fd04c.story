One Spokane,Washington chihuahua learned an important lesson the hard way earlier this month when he attempted to drive his owner's car and got into a fender-bender with an unsuspecting driver.

Tabitha Oraecha was driving home from work when she stopped at a red light at Crestine and Empire and got a furry surprise when a seemingly driver-less car bumped into her tire.

She later noticed that a mischievous little chihuahua by the name of Toby was behind the wheel and he never graduated from driver's ed.

Put your paw to the pedal: Toby takes his owners car for a little afternoon ride

Tabitha thought she might be 'crazy' when she saw a little dog behind the wheel of a car

'When I looked up, there was no one in the car, just a little dog up on the steering wheel peeking over looking at me,' said Ormaechea to KREM-TV.

The dog's owner, Jason Martiniez, just went into a store for a few minutes and apparently that was enough time for Toby to take a joy-ride.

'I didn't know what to think. Someone just ran into the store and asked if anyone has a gold car and I said, yeah, me why,' said dog owner Jason Martinez.

Martinez thinks the dog kicked the car out of gear by accident.

'He must have knocked it out of gear and the car rolled out,' said Martinez.

Thankfully no one was injured in the accident but Martinez said he wont be letting his dog drive anytime soon.Â 

Jason Martinez only went to the store for a few minutes but that was enough time for Toby to gear up for a drive
