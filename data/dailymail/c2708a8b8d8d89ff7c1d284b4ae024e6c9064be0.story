Squatters fighting against the expansion of Heathrow have vowed to continue their sit-in on a plot of land after bailiffs failed to show up.

The protesters calling themselves Grow Heathrow have created a market garden at Sipson, Middlesex, which would be bulldozed if the airport succeeds in its campaign to build a third runway.

The group was served an eviction notice last month and expected bailiffs to enforce it this morning.

Protesters at Sipson near Heathrow make plain their views over how long they intend to prevent the expansion of the airport, They have been in situ for four years and were expecting to face bailiffs determined to evict them this morning but instead they were faced with the land owner Imran Malik

However, the owner of the land went alone and was met by the squatters and 'up to 200' supporters.

Grow Heathrow was set up on the land four years ago and the group threatened to dig tunnels and use locks to frustrate the expected eviction attempt.

Campaigners, some of whom live on the land, have been training in ways to prevent efforts to remove them.

The land is owned by businessman Imran Malik, and the decision to evict them was upheld in the Court of Appeal.

Today John McDonnell, the Labour MP for Hayes and Harlington, handed Mr Malik a letter urging him to discuss the issue with the residents, who want to buy the land.

Protesters claim he has so far not returned requests to talk about the land.

Cameron Richardson, a resident at Grow Heathrow, said: 'This morning was a mixture of excitement and apprehension because this could have potentially been a foretaste for what might happen if a third runway at Heathrow is granted.

'We were ready to peacefully resist using lock-on and peaceful manpower stopping them coming through the gate.

'We're hopeful that in the next few days and weeks that he'll come and talk to us and start an adult conversation.

'I think we're still waiting to see if the bailiffs are going to come and we're ready for it but I'm hoping we're going to start a negotiation to buy this land and have a community-owned project for everybody.'

Tracey Howard, who lives in Sipson, said: 'I've been fighting for no third runway for the last 14 years and this is another cog to our wheel of the battle we've been fighting.

'We want to keep our village so anything that is offering support is a benefit to anybody.

'I would be lying if I said we couldn't get evicted off this land because we could, but I'm hopeful the land owner will talk to us about selling it.'

Grow Heathrow claimed that up to 200 locals joined the protest chanting and playing music, and dancing and singing.
