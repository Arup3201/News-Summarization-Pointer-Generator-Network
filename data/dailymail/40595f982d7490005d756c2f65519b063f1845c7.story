Fourteen people have died and eight are injured after a double-decker bus plunged at least 30ft from a bridge in China last night.

The sleeper coach, travelling from the provincial capital Wuhan to Enshi, was carrying 22 passengers, most of whom were migrants, when it fell from the road crossing the Yangtze River.

An investigation has been launched, but initial reports suggest the coach may have swerved to avoid a motorcyclist.

Rescue workers continue to search through the wreckage of the coach for survivors

Two of the injured are in a critical condition and are battling for life.

Of the other six injured, four cases are serious but stable, the health bureau in Jingzhou City said this morning.

The double-decker coach, owned by a transport company in Enshi, went through the guardrail of the Jingzhou Yangtze River Bridge and hit the river beach at around 7 pm.

Authorities said they are yet to identify the victims.

Death tolls from bus crashes can often be high in China as they are a popular form of transport for migrant workers.
