A devastated mother has revealed her daughters' school threatened her with court after the girls missed class to spend time with their terminally ill father.

Teenagers Lydia and Leah Vaughan were last week at the bedside of their dying father, Martin, 40, after he was rushed to hospital after his cancer spread.

But their mother Nicolette was then sent a letter by their school threatening legal action for unauthorised absences.

Shocking: A school threatened Nicolette Vaughan with legal action after children Leah and Lydia missed classes to be with their terminally ill father

Bereft:  Lydia and Leah with their father Martin who has been battling cancer, which's now spread to his liver

She had kept Bispham High School in Blackpool, Lancashire, informed of her husband's illness since his first diagnosis in 2010 and had told them it had spread to his liver and was terminal.

But the school still sent out the threatening letter and have since apologised for their heavy-handed approach.

Mother-of-three Nicolette, 37, said: 'Martin has been battling cancer and it has been diagnosed as terminal - the school is fully aware of all this.

'On March 24 he was rushed by ambulance into hospital in absolute agony, a disturbing and upsetting sight the girls both bravely witnessed.  

'I rang the school and left a message explaining everything that had happened and I didn't know when the girls would be back as everything was up in the air.  

'Despite this I was sent a text asking where they were. I was furious.  

'The school states that unless the circumstances are exceptional poor attendance is not tolerated - what is more exceptional than your father dying of cancer?  

'I can't emphasise enough how thoroughly disgusted I am with the schools complete lack of support or even empathy for my girls.'  

Apology: The headteacher at Bispham has said sorry to the family but said it is trying to drive up attendance

She said she has been contacted on a number of other occasions to query  absences.  

Last month Ashbrook Junior School in Derbyshire,has been accused of imposing a Victorian punishment regime after it secretly forced its pupils to wear a humiliating ‘I am going to the toilet' sign.

Staff at  made ten and 11-year-olds march to the lavatory with a label round their necks to improve discipline.

Riley Pearson, six, from near Slough, was suspended from his school after he took a bag of Mini Cheddars in his packed lunch before later being expelled for more food related problems. 

Colnbrook C of E Primary School insisted he was not excluded 'for just having Mini Cheddars in their lunchbox' but because there had been a 'persistent and deliberate breach of school policy, such as bringing in crisps, biscuits, sausage rolls, mini sausages, scotch eggs and similar'.  

Jordan Cobby, from Nuneaton, was diagnosed with a tumour behind his eye in 2008 and died aged 14. 

Tribute wristbands in his memory were sold at his school, the Nuneaton Academy, following his death, with all proceeds donated charity.

But the school banned pupils from wearing them saying they are not part of the uniform.

The school - which was placed in special measures last year - has now apologised and said the letter was sent out in error.  

They accepted that Lydia should never have been on their attendance initiative list.  

Martin, a panel beater, was diagnosed with cancer four years ago when doctors discovered a tumour the size of a golf ball behind his eye.  

In 2012 he was told the tragic news the cancer had spread to his liver and was terminal.  

The couple's son Caleb, 17, also attended the school.  

Acting school head Deborah Hanlon-Catlow said: 'I am very sorry Mrs Vaughan received this letter, which was sent out in error.  

'The school is committed to helping families whose children have poor attendance, and has targeted support for a number of children.  

'As part of our drive to improve attendance, letters were sent out to specific parents - unfortunately, Mrs Vaughan has received this letter as well when it did not apply to her or her family.  

'As soon as we realised the mistake, the letter was rescinded and the school has apologised directly to the family for any distress caused.  

'I am well aware of the difficult situation the family is facing and the school is supporting the pupils through what must be a very upsetting time.'  

The school has had a troubled year after being placed in special measures by Ofsted inspectors.
