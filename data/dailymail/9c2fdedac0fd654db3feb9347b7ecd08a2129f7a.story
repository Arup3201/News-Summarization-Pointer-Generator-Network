A survey found that a third of people work through their sixties because they can't afford to retire

One in three older people work through their sixties because they can’t afford to retire, a survey has found.

The majority keep working past the state pension age – but half do so mainly because they need the money, it concluded.

And a million ‘unretired’ older people have gone back to work, mostly because they can’t afford the lifestyle they want.

The findings, from insurance company LV, suggest many of the millions who work past retirement age do so out of necessity.

The end of compulsory retirement at 65 means large numbers who would once have been forced to retire can keep working. But the loss of ‘gold-plated’ final salary pensions in the private sector, and the inadequate savings of many who rely on a fund to pay for their retirement, mean increasing numbers may have no choice.

The survey of 1,116 people by Opinium Research found four out of ten retired at the state pension age. Six out of ten worked on, for an average of three days a week.

Around half of those wanted ‘to boost their retirement income’, it found.

Richard Rowney, of LV, said: ‘For many people, working for longer is a positive choice. However we cannot ignore that for others, their financial situation means they have to continue working – or even go back to work after retiring – because they simply cannot afford to stop.’

One in six pension-age workers, or around a million people, have ‘unretired’.

‘There is a trend to unretire, with many retirees returning back to work,’ the report said. Half said they needed money, while four out of ten were bored at home.

Despite more pensioners working than ever, only one in 20 defer collecting the state pension – although doing so boosts its value by more than 10 per cent a year.

The survey found more than a quarter of those who keep working run their own businesses. One in five had launched a business after the age of 60.

Among older workers who said they did not need money, the most common reasons for having a job were enjoyment and feeling too young to stop. Three-quarters said they feel much younger than they are, with most saying they feel they are only 50.
