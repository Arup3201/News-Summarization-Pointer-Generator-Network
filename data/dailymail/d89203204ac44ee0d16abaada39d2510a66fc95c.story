A shocking image of a woman apparently pointing a handgun at a child's head has prompted concerns for the toddler's welfare.

The photograph has been shared on social media hundreds of times since it first appeared online last month as worried web users desperately try to identify the pair in order to alert the authorities.

However, the search has been hindered by the lack of information about the picture's origins.

Shocking: This photograph shared on Facebook appears to show a woman pointing a gun at a child

The photograph shows a young woman smiling as she points what looks like a pistol directly between the eyes of a child aged around two years old.

There are few details about when or where it was taken, but it seems to have appeared originally on an Argentinian Facebook page around a month ago, suggesting the people in it are Latin American.

The image sparked panic when it was posted on blogs which campaign against domestic abuse.

No Longer Victims shared the photo, saying: 'If there is anybody that can help us to find this child, please please do so.'

The blog later added: 'A baby can be traumatised like anybody that is a victim of abuse - and this is a form of abuse.'

Facebook users have reacted with outrage to the image, with some calling it 'downright evil'.

It is not known whether the gun shown in the picture is in fact real, or whether it is a capgun or a prop weapon.

However, many people have suggested that even if it is some sort of replica, it is nonetheless irresponsible to expose such a young child to gun violence.
