David Cameron and George Osborne will save a fortune after HMRC miscalculated how much tax they should pay on their homes.

Savings of at least £1,228 a year will be made by the Prime Minister while the chancellor is saving £1,560 per annum, it has been reported.

Tax is due on their flats in Downing Street because they are a taxable benefit.

Downing Street is regarded as a taxable benefit - but an error by HMRC means PM David Cameron is saving £1,228 a year

The error dates back to more than ten 
years according to the Daily Mirror, and may also entitle former Downing Street residents Tony Blair, 
Gordon Brown and Alastair Darling to rebates.

The pair have been criticised for accepting cuts to their tax bills while imposing policies like the Bedroom Tax on others.

Blundering officials at HMRC have let Cameron and Osborne off paying the right amount of tax on their properties.

Tax is due on their flats in Downing Street because it is a taxable benefit.

Because they have been applying tax rules incorrectly, the PM will save at least £1,228 a year while the Chancellor will save £1,560.

Richard Murphy, of Tax Research UK, said he was shocked that the Prime Minister and the Chancellor had accepted the tax cuts – at a time when everyone is supposed ‘to be in it together’.

He said: ‘It is surprising that in this time of austerity when everyone is meant to be in it together that they are willing to take tax cuts that are not available to anyone else.’

Treasury insiders said the cut came about when it was discovered the taxman had been applying tax rules in the wrong way.

Mr Murphy said: ‘It’s a mistake by HMRC, but instead of pointing out their mistake they have just accepted it.’

Alex Hilton, director of Generation Rent which campaigns for private renters, said the government should be focusing on lowering the cost of renting for ordinary people.

He said: ‘Britain’s renters are paying 40 per cent of their income on housing. If we are all in this together then the PM and the chancellor should help others to lower their housing costs.’

A spokesperson from the Treasury said Cameron and Osborne were being treated no differently to their predecessors.

They said: ‘The Prime Minister and Chancellor pay tax on the benefit in kind of using the flat in Downing Street, and this is independently calculated by HMRC. This is exactly the same arrangement as previous Chancellors and Prime Ministers.’
