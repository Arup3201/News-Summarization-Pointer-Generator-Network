A green-fingered grandfather spent 25 years creating a beautiful garden on a 'borrowed' patch of barren wasteland.

Des Churchill, 88, has plowed more than £10,000 into the L-shaped piece of land which belongs to a housing association, because his first floor flat in Llantrisant, Wales, does not have a garden.

Fortunately RCT Homes, the housing association which owns the property and garden in partnership with Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council, approves of the pensioner’s efforts.

Hard at work: Des Churchill, 88, spent 25 years turning the piece of wasteland by his flat into a spectacular garden because the first floor property did not come with a garden

Mr Churchill has spent more than £10,000 on colourful flowers for garden by his flat in Llantrisant, Wales

Grandfather Des Churchill beside just some of the flowers he has planted on a patch of wasteland next to his first floor flat, which is owned by a housing association. Fortunately they have praised the pensioner's efforts

Mr Churchill said: ‘They like what I have done - everyone has been behind me all the way.’

‘My neighbours love the garden and say it really brightens up the flats.’

When retired coal miner Mr Churchill moved into the flat in 1988 the land was an uncared for patch of grass.

He said: ‘When I moved into the flat there were no plants and flowers, just a scruffy bit of grass.’

Mr Churchill set to work immediately and planted a golden privet hedge and ornamental maple tree.

Mr Churchill, a former coal miner, started off by planting a hedge (left) and then turned his attentions to flowers

He said: ‘Everything you see growing I bought and planted.

‘Green fingers run in the family - my brother was a farmer and we’ve always had a garden to look after.’

And his efforts have paid off because his gardening skills have bagged him prizes in local gardening competitions such as the annual Rhondda Cynon Taff garden contest.

After transforming the wasteland into a beautiful garden, Des Churchill has won local horticultural contests

Having spent 35 years working in the mines, Mr Churchill likes to spend as much time as possible outdoors

Mr Churchill, who lives with wife Olive, 86, also grows fruit and vegetables on the plot which he shares with his neighbours who have been happy to lend a hand too.

He said: ‘Everyone seems to enjoy it. When my petrol mower conked out the neighbours clubbed together to by me a new one.’

Mr Churchill, who spent 30 years underground as a miner in the Welsh valleys, now prefers the great outdoors.

He said: ‘I have to be outside. I am out here for at least two or three hours every day - if it’s raining I go in the shed and tidy up.

Even when it's raining Mr Churchill goes outside to his garden shed to potter around and tend to the plants

‘I can’t bend on my knees so I have tools that mean I can garden while standing up.

‘The biggest challenges I have are the weather and selecting the right plants to grow.’Olive, his wife of 66 years, said: ‘I’m very proud of what Des has created.

‘He’s out there all the time, but I don’t mind - sometimes if he’s under my feet I send him back out.’

Neighbour Shirley Corlea, who has contributed plants and a bench for the garden, added: ‘It’s a pleasure to see all his hard work come out in bloom at this time of year.’

Neighbourhood Officer Allyson Whiston from RCT Homes said she looked forward to seeing the garden grow over the coming years.

She said: 'I don’t think I’ve ever seen such beautiful and well-cared for communal gardens.

'The neighbours take so much pleasure out of this wonderful garden that Des has created.

'Everyone comments on how beautiful it is and how it is having such a positive impact on their lives.'

Des Churchill was disappointed he didn't have a garden when he moved in

But he realised that the 'scruffy bit of grass' next to his flat had potential

@highlight

So he spent the next 25 years and £10K transforming it into an oasis

@highlight

The land he has put so much love into is owned by a housing association

But fortunately they approve of Mr Churchill's work to his home in Wales
