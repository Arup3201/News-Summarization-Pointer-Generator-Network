As the wife of the Prime Minister, she has undoubtedly stood alongside some of the country’s most powerful and influential women.

But last night, Samantha Cameron found herself next to one of the most inspirational.

Mrs Cameron honoured mother-of-one Naomi Thomas as she was named the overall winner of the Daily Mail’s seventh annual Inspirational Women of the Year Awards.

The 31-year-old, who is terminally ill with secondary breast cancer, was invited to 10 Downing Street before a gala dinner at the Marriott Hotel in London’s Grosvenor Square.

Mrs Thomas received the award in recognition of her work setting up a charity to plan weddings for the terminally ill.

Mrs Thomas, from Somerset, was first diagnosed with the disease in 2009, two days after becoming engaged to her partner, Graham. Just six days after their son was born in 2010, she was told the cancer was incurable.

The couple were forced to give up work to cope with the demands of the illness, meaning the wedding they booked had to be cancelled. However, a local wedding planner then offered to help arrange a ceremony as cheaply as possible, inspiring Mrs Thomas to set up The Wedding Wishing Well Foundation.

Mrs Thomas was joined at Downing Street by Strictly Come Dancing host Sir Bruce Forsyth and the four other finalists in the awards, held in association with British Gas and homeless charity Shelter.

After the reception, the women went on to the awards ceremony, where the winner was announced by Sir Bruce. He paid tribute to the finalists as he arrived on stage, saying: ‘This has been one of the most emotional nights I have been to.’

After being named as the winner, Mrs Thomas said: ‘I have worked unpaid for so many hours each week. If I can save one person, I have done my job. I have got my husband and my son, I couldn’t ask for any more.’

Susan Belgrave, 88, from Dorchester, was nominated for her work with the Beanstalk charity, which has helped 80,000 children improve their literacy skills. Set up 40 years ago with just seven volunteers, the charity now has 2,400 helpers across 1,000 UK primary schools.

Janis Feely MBE was recognised for creating a free counselling centre to help people with addictions. The 66-year-old former alcoholic from Stevenage set up The Living Room in 2000 and has since helped more than 2,650 people overcome addiction, achieving an average recovery rate of 70 percent.

As a result of her work, 43 children have been taken out of care and returned to their parents, and many more removed from the Child Protection Register.

Pat Rogers, 61, from Blackburn, has been tackling youth violence and founded the Every Action Has Consequences campaign, which educates youngsters in schools, colleges, prisons and youth clubs. She set up the campaign in 2009 after losing her 24-year-old son Adam in a street fight.

Dinner lady and mother of three Jeanette Orrey MBE was nominated for her efforts in helping to improve school dinners across Britain. The 57-year-old from Newark co-founded the Food for Life organisation in 2007. It now works with 4,600 schools and provides 120million school meals a year.

The five finalists, selected from hundreds of extraordinary women nominated by the Daily Mail’s readers, have all won an all-expenses paid trip to London, while Mrs Thomas has been handed a £5,000 luxury holiday.

The awards ceremony was attended by a number of celebrities, including Esther Rantzen, Michael Buerk, Anton du Beke and Sian Williams.

Miss Williams last night revealed that visiting Downing Street had been on Mrs Thomas’s ‘bucket list’. She added that Mrs Thomas and Mrs Cameron had chatted about their love of internet shopping during the meeting yesterday.
