An ex-staffer for Republican Rep. Blake Farenthold is suing the married congressman's office for wrongful termination,  court documents discovered today reveal.

The plaintiff in the case, Farenthold's former communications director, Lauren Greene, alleges that the congressman and his chief of staff engaged in 'hostile conduct' toward her and that Farenthold sexually harassed her on multiple occasions.

She also claims in the lawsuit that the Texas lawmaker 'regularly drank to excess' and had 'a tendency to flirt' at Capitol Hill functions with women who were not his wife. 

On one occasion the congressman allegedly told his aides that a 'female lobbyist had propositioned him for a "threesome." ' On another, Greene says he told her that he and his 'estranged' wife Debbie had not had sex in years.

Greene also claims that after the chief of staff complained that her shirt was 'transparent' and he could see her nipples, Farenthold told his personal assistant that as far as he was concerned, Greene 'could show her nipples whenever she wanted to.'

The court filing, first uncovered by the National Law Journal, was submitted to the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia on Friday and charges that Farenthold's office violated the Congressional Accountability Act when it fired Greene in July.

According to the court documents, Greene began working in Farenthold's office in February 2013 as the new media director. The following January she was promoted to communications director after the congressman's previous spokesperson gave notice. A review of her pay stubs on congressional database Legistorm confirms that much.

On what was to be her first day in the new position, however, Greene claims she was informed by the chief of staff in the office, Bob Haueter, that she would have to interview for the job and that he was also speaking with other candidates. 

He ended up formally offering her the position the next day, but Greene says he made her 'professional life unbearable' and five months later she was fired after making her concerns about Haueter's behavior known to the congressman. 

While the court filing names the 'hostile work environment' that both Farenthold and Haueter allegedly created as the reason for the lawsuit, it specifies that 'gender discrimination' was the reason for Greene's mistreatment.

According to the former aide, several weeks before her promotion, she told Farenthold's executive assistant Emily Wilkes that the congressman 'was awkward toward her at work and regularly seemed to try to avoid interacting with her.'

Wilkes in turn shared that the congressman and father of two 'had admitted to being attracted' to Greene and having 'sexual fantasies' and 'wet dreams' about her.

'Farenthold knew that Wilkes and Plaintiff were friends and confidantes and that Wilkes would likely convey his comments to Plaintiff, which is exactly what happened on this and other occasions,' the lawsuit contends.

After finding out the sexual fantasies, Greene said she was 'anxious' to avoid one-on-one meetings with the congressman, and he seemed to avoid her, too, making it difficult to her do her job. 

Yet the court documents also claim that the congressman 'regularly' made comments toward Green that were meant to determine her interest in a 'sexual relationship.'

One time 'Farenthold told Greene that she had something on her skirt and that he hoped his comment wouldn’t be taken for sexual harassment,' the document says.

'A reasonable person would infer that Farenthold was joking that she had semen on her skirt,' it goes on to say.

Another time Greene says the congressman told her that her skirt was partly unzipped. Upon inspecting her skit in the bathroom 'she realized that the opening was so small that Farenthold would have had to be staring at her closely to notice.'

After word got out on Tuesday about Greene's lawsuit against her former employer, she deleted her twitter account - but not before MailOnline took a screenshot of it

The lawsuit indicates that it was the chief of staff's terse relationship with Greene that ultimately led to her firing, not the congressman's unwanted advances.

The filing lists numerous ways in which the chief of staff undercut her, including publicly humiliating her at staff meetings and 'blaming her for errors and failings committed by others.'

She eventually set up a meeting with Farenthold at which point she alerted him that the chief of staff was 'bullying her and treating her in a very hostile fashion.'

'Farenthold replied that Haueter was known to be condescending toward women on the staff, and then paid empty, lip service encouragement for Plaintiff to stand up for herself,' the lawsuit states.

After that point both the congressman and Haueter 'marginalized and undermined' her, Greene claims, and several weeks later she was fired, without any warning.

On Tuesday Farenthold's office rejected Greene's version of events and denied that it discriminated against her.

'It goes without saying that both the Congressman and the members of his staff who are included in this complaint have a very different view of the allegations than Ms. Greene,' Farenthold's current spokesman, Kurt Bardella, said in a statement to The National Law Journal.

'For the record, the Office did not and does not discriminate based on sex or any other unlawful factor. The Congressman is eager to respond to Ms. Greene's allegations through the appropriate legal process and is confident that once all of the facts are revealed, he will be cleared of any wrongdoing,' the statement continued.  

Worst week ever: Farenthold made headlines yesterday after a Twitter user discovered that the former entrepreneur still owned the domain name blowe-me.org

Farenthold was first elected to Congress in the Republican wave of 2010. 

In a true October surprise, a photo of the Texas politician in ducky pajamas standing next to a scantily-clad model at a night club was released two weeks before the election.

The photo was revealed to have been taken a lingerie and pajama-themed birthday party fundraiser for a friend of Farenthold's.

A news article from the time says that the money raised at the party was to benefit four charities: the American Heart Association, Big Brothers and Big Sisters of South Texas, the Gulf Coast Humane Society and the Women’s Shelter of South Texas.

'They say it’s some big-night-on-the-town party. It was a fundraiser for a local charity,' Farenthold said of the gathering.

The conservative politician said he hadn't filed for office when he attended the event nearly a year earlier.

'But regardless of whether I was running for office or not, I’ll put on funny clothes if it’s going to raise money for charity,' Farenthold said. 

Despite taking flak for the photo, Farenthold went on to narrowly beat his Democratic opponent, incumbent Rep. Solomon Ortiz, in that November's midterm election. He's since won reelection easily as a result of changes to Texas' congressional map that made his district more Republican.

Prior to being elected to Congress Farenthold worked as a lawyer and founded a web design company. His days as an entrepreneur caused another salacious problem for him this week when a Twitter user pointed out that he still owns the lewdly titled website blow-me.org.

Roll Call followed up on the tip and determined that Farenthold purchased the domain name in 1999 and it expires on July 23, 2015.

A second spokesman for Farenthold's office, Michael Rekola, confirmed to the news publication on Monday that site was in fact registered to the three-term representative.

'Prior to serving in Congress, Mr. Farenthold operated a computer consulting company that routinely bought domain names including the one in question. The domain name has never been used and Mr. Farenthold has no intention to renew it,' Rekola said.
