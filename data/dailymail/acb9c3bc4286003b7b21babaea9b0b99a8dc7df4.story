A street robber shot dead a young woman who would not let go of her purse in Philadelphia last night.

Recently graduated architect Amber Long, 26, died after she was shot in the chest by the gunman who stopped her and her mother as they walked in an upmarket area of the city.

Miss Long was walking near her boyfriend's house with her mother, Stephanie Long, about 10.30pm Sunday in Northern Liberties, one of Philadelphia's trendiest neighborhoods.

The two were walking back from nearby Center City back to get Amber's car, when they were approached by a man, who demanded money, according to CBS Local.

Stephanie Long spoke about the incident on Monday, saying through tears that her daughter would not let go of a purse they had bought earlier in the day for just $14.

The bandit opened fire on the keen dancer during a scuffle, shooting her in the middle of chest.

Speaking to CBS Local about the death of her daughter, a grief-stricken Stephanie Long said the crime was 'senseless'

A purse thief shot and killed a woman in front of her mother on Sunday night as they walked along a street in one of Philadelphia's trendiest neighborhoods, Northern Liberties. Here police are investigating the scene

'She was extremely talented,' Mrs Long told CBS of her daughter.

'It was so senseless. We had bought that purse earlier that day for $14.'

She wouldn't let go of it and he shot her.

'There was no reason. There was no point.'

Mrs Long was not injured, but the thief made off with her bag.

Long was rushed to Hahnemann University Hospital, where she was pronounced dead about 11.15pm.

Investigators will review surveillance video from nearby buildings in the hope of identifying the shooter.

Preliminary investigations suggest the man was white and wearing dark clothing.

Police are still searching for the shooter involved in killing a woman during a robbery on Sunday night. They issued a $20,000 reward for information on the case

He is said to have gotten into a dark-colored Chevy Impala being driven by another man following the robbery.

'When
 we have senseless crimes like this take place there's no reasoning 
behind it,' said Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey.

The city offered a $20,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction in this case. Anyone with information should contact Philadelphia Police.

Amber had written on her Linkedin page that her dream was to become a certified architect.

'The challenges in life feed into my ambition, and the research and hard work needed to turn those challenges into opportunities create the most gratifying experience of all,' she wrote on her profile.

'Fame can be overrated, however loving what you do is priceless.'

It was the second shooting police responded to on Sunday night.

Around the same time of the Northern Liberties shooting a teen was shot in the head and neck along the 3200 block of Kensington Avenue.

The child was rushed to St. Christopher's Hospital for Children.
