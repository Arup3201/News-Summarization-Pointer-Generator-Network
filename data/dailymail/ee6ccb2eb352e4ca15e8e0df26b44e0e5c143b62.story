The riddle surrounding the woman who was discovered in Mexico nine years after going missing took a bizarre twist today after police cast doubt on claims she'd ever been kidnapped.

Family and friends of Connie McCallister – now 25 - have repeatedly told how their loved one was abducted by her abusive Mexican boyfriend, drugged and smuggled across the border, aged just 15.

They say they have had absolutely no contact with her until she finally got in touch in mid-September, revealed she had split up with the older man she had gone to Mexico with and was now married with three children and was working on a farm in an undisclosed location.  

Riddle: Wausau police today said Connie McCallister never told them when she was found in September that she had been drugged and smuggled across the Mexican border by an abusive boyfriend

Contradiction: Karen Zubke of the Trinity Lutheran Church wipes a tear from her eye as she and Judy Weise talk about raising funds to bring Connie back. They are hurt by claims doubting Connie's story of her ordeal

Aided by the local church, her aunt Florence Volska has launched a $5,000 fundraising campaign to help bring Connie, her husband and the three young girls back to her home in Athens, Wisconsin. They hope to have her back in weeks after filling out all the necessary paperwork.

She has been in regular Skype contact with Connie for the last seven weeks - when her long-lost niece first made contact. 

Yesterday she described the moment she saw her niece on a computer screen for the first time in nine years. She said: 'I cried for an hour. I literally cried. And it was her. I thank God everyday.'

But Wausau police force seemed to contradict the family's version of events, saying Connie left with her older boyfriend Freddie Ruiz voluntarily - or at least that is what she told them at first.

They added Connie had spoken to her mother Cindy days after she was 'kidnapped' and told her she was 'fine'. 

She also apparently told her mother she was not going to reveal where she was going. Cindy then apparently indicated to police the pair were probably going to 'flee to Mexico', according to the statement.

Her mother is believed to now be living in Florida and has had no contact with her daughter since her re-emergence. 

Detective Captain Greg Hagenbucher said: 'For the past several years Wausau Police have heard rumors that Connie McCallister was in Mexico, was married and had three children with her husband, who was not the boyfriend she left with.'

Hagenbucher added: 'This week the Waussau Police Department was made aware of a fundraiser that will take place at Trinity Church in Athens. 

'We were told that the fliers being passed out articulated that Connie McCallister had been kidnapped, drugged and abused in Mexico with her first husband. 

'This was not the information Connie related to law enforcement when we talked to her in September of this year. 

The statement went on to explain police also made contact with Connie on Skype yesterday to ask her about the allegations. 

Memories: Connie, center, with her brother Morris, left, sister Jeannie, and mother Cindy, back. Connie has yet to speak to her mother since being discovered by a missionary in September

Call for help: Police say they issued the statement questioning the version of events after they saw fliers for a soup drive spelling out Connie's shocking ordeal

It said: 'We asked her about the information being reported... that Connie told officers that in 2004 she left Wausau voluntarily with Freddie and ended up at a party somewhere in the Milwaukee / Chicago area. 

'She said while at the party she thinks someone may have drugged her as the next day she woke up in Mexico.

'Connie offered no explanation why she did not tell us this several months ago when we Skyped with her.

'The Wausau Police Department will work with the FBI and family in an attempt to return Connie and her family safely to the U.S. Once she returns to the U.S. we will discuss with Connie the circumstances of her leaving Wausau with Freddie Ruiz.'

Today's statement came just hours after the two McCallister family friends championing Connie's safe return told MailOnline how they believed Ruiz had spiked a bottle of Mountain Dew, drugged Connie and smuggled her across the border. 

The family say Connie texted her elder sister Jeannie on the night of the party, saying, 'He won't let me come home'.

There is still a warrant out for Ruiz's arrest relating to an alleged sexual assault on a minor, which happened just weeks before the pair disappeared. 

The police and the family and their friends are at odds over another claim. Karen Zubke and Judy Weise, of the Lutheran church, also told how Connie had reached out to police in Wausau five years ago, but officers dismissed it as a hoax. 

Family: Connie, left, with her siblings Jeannie and Morris. They had recently moved to Wausau when she disappeared after their father's tragic death from cancer

Vanished: Connie and her family lived above this bakery in Athens when she struck up a relationship with Ruiz, described by her friends as a 'sexual predator', who claim he should have been arrested when social services became aware of the relationship in 2004

Karen said: 'Freddie was a sexual predator and Connie was kidnapped. People ask why she didn't escape sooner considering she was in three different relationships and escaped Freddie, then another abusive man, but no one knows the real situation.

'She was only a child when she was kidnapped and after years of mental and physical abuse, maybe she didn't have the strength to try to get away.

'Also, she did contact the police five years ago, but they thought it was a hoax. I don't know what the circumstances were. Maybe the man she was with found out and pressured her into not going through with it. 

'But the fact she tried to reach out and failed will have knocked her confidence as well. The family are obviously very frustrated that the police didn't believe Connie.'

When asked about the people in the community who doubt Connie's story, both Karen and fellow fundraiser Judy are obviously extremely upset. 

Karen said: 'Connie's childhood wasn't perfect and Cindy didn't have all the assets that maybe she needed, but it is very frustrating that we have to deal with all these sharks who are trying to doubt what happened. 

'All we want is to get Connie back where she belongs, back in Athens with her family. We appreciate anyone who wants to help, but we are not begging.'

She added: 'We all warned her about Freddie, but he was older and was probably telling her everything a 15-year-old girl wanted to hear. But the authorities should have stopped it. When social services got involved they told the family to move half an hour away to Wausau. 

'That does not seem like good advice to me. What they should have done is arrested Freddie. 

'Connie was always a little girl, but she was a fighter and when she realized something was wrong that night in Milwaukee she would have put up a struggle, that is when we believe Freddie drugged her.'

But it is not just the police who are skeptical about Connie's abduction story. Mary Marohl, who owns the bakery below the McCallister's family apartment in Athens said she knew the family very well. 

And she is in no doubt that Connie left of her own accord. She also said Cindy struggled to look after Connie, Jeannie and their younger brother Morris, after her husband died of cancer when Connie was five.

Mary said: 'Her husband had died and Cindy wasn't really a great mother. The town pretty much took care of them. People in the town think she just took off with Freddie. 

'Most people don't think she was kidnapped. I personally didn't think she had been. I talked to her all the time because she helped out here after school and she wasn't happy with the situation with her mother.

'Her mother had a boyfriend at the time, a younger guy who came to live with them. For a while he wasn't working at all and she didn't like that. Also, her mother didn't like Freddie. I thought he seemed nice and it seemed to me he gave her more stability than she got at home. She loved him.'

Connie McCallister made contact with her family after a church missionary told the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children that she had been spotted.

The honor-roll student at Athens High School weighed just 98lb at the time and had been working as a field laborer in Mexico under a new name, after escaping two abusive relationships.

Miss McCallister apparently escaped from Freddie but ended up with another violent man who fathered her first child. 

At one point he beat her so badly that she was taken to hospital, where someone helped her get a new identity, Ms Weise, who works for Trinity Lutheran Church in Athens, said. 

Her aunt Florence said that with no proof of her identity, and unable to speak Spanish, Miss McCallister struggled to contact her family.

She worked in fields and later married and had two more children.

Since making contact with her family she has barely left her home in Mexico, because she is apparently scared of reprisals from Freddie. That is also the reason why her relatives will not reveal her exact location.
