Sergio Aguero was lucky to stay on the pitch against West Ham on Saturday during a game in which Sam Allardyce's side marshalled the Manchester City striker with relative ease.

West Ham duo Winston Reid and James Collins were able to deal with everything that was thrown at them - with Aguero forced into feeding off scraps during the Premier League encounter.

And the Argentina international should have been sent for an early bath for a studs-up challenge on Mark Noble.

Aguero looked lively during the opening minutes as the 26-year-old tried to test Hammers stopper Adrian.

His effort flashed just wide of the goal but his attempt sent a warning to West Ham's defence -  they had to keep a close eye on the Premier League's joint-leading scorer.

West Ham's rearguard were forced into stopping Aguero's typically mazy runs on two occasions by simply hacking the striker down on the edge of the box. 

Yaya Toure was handed the responsibility of taking the subsequent free-kicks but his attempts did not trouble Adrian.

His link-up play with David Silva was particularly impressive but he was not allowed the time and space to test West Ham's Spanish keeper.

Aguero, who cut a frustrated figure during the first half, should not have even appeared back on the Upton Park turf after the interval as the former Atletico Madrid man swiped at the legs of Noble on the stroke of half-time.

Manuel Pellegrini brought on Stevan Jovetic for Edin Dzeko to try to get the best out of his star forward and the substitution seemed to have an immediate effect on City's forward play. 

Aguero had the perfect opportunity to put City on level terms in the 65th minute when he was played in by Jesus Navas but his shot from close range smashed against the bar.

Silva stepped up to the plate after West Ham had doubled their advantage by twisting and turning inside the area before curling the ball past Adrian but the champions were unable to find the equaliser.
