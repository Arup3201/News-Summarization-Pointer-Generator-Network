Lady Cecil has spoken of the huge significance of Noble Mission’s Qipco Champions Stakes win to the long-term future of her Newmarket stable.

But she has not been told whether she will still be training Frankel’s younger brother next year or if any relative of the legendary unbeaten horse will be stabled at Warren Place in 2015.

Frankel, as well as his four siblings, have all raced for Lady Cecil or her late husband Sir Henry.

Half-sister Joyeuse, a dual winner at Listed race level, will return to owner Prince Khaled Abdullah’s stud this week after her racing career ended with a sixth place in the Challenge Stakes at Newmarket on Friday.

Abdullah, the owner of around half the 50 horses in Lady Cecil’s care, has a yearling full-brother by Galileo to both Frankel and Noble Mission to go into training in 2015.

His racing manager, Lord Grimthorpe, said the link between his boss and Warren Place remained strong but that no decision had been made about whether Noble Mission would be retired or if the latest in the family line would follow in their hoofprints to Warren Place.

Grimthorpe, who said Abdullah had around 20 foals from Frankel’s first crop to put into training, added: ‘No decision has been made about where any of our yearlings will be trained has been made and won’t be for some time. The Prince is still thinking what to do with Noble Mission.’

The organisers of Champions Day might have thought they had used up all their luck having the best horse in a generation in Frankel to run at their meeting in its first two years, not only winning the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes in 2011 and the Champion Stakes in 2012 but adding priceless impetus to its launch.

But they were clearly wrong as his brother produced the perfect climax to Saturday’s season-ending finale.

For Lady Cecil, it was not only hugely emotional to be standing in the same place as her husband two years earlier after winning Britain’s most valuable race, but also a galloping prime time advertisement for the stable which now carries her name.

Lady Cecil said: ‘It is hugely important for people to see we can do it. It is wonderful to have owners like Prince Khaled and the Niarchos family but it is always good to attract new people.

‘It would be lovely some looked at Noble on Saturday and think they are doing a good job why don’t we give them a try.

‘We thought Noble Mission was in great shape but you just don’t dare to dream it. Being Frankel’s brother, to win the race he went out on, you couldn’t make it up.’

It was a third Group One win of the season for Noble Mission, who had previously won the Tattersalls Gold Cup and Grand Prix de Saint Cloud.

He has been a standard bearer for Cecil in her first full season at the helm, his form and reputation transformed by the front-running tactics so efficiently carried out by jockey James Doyle, who is unlikely to appeal against the seven-day ban and £10,000 fine for using his whip above the permitted level.

It will cost him mounts at the Breeders’ Cup and in the Melbourne Cup.

The jockey said: ‘The rules are there and you have to take the consequences. Hopefully the suspension and the fine won't overshadow what happened. I don't what such a great race marred by people saying he got a ban and a fine. That would be upsetting.’

Doyle’s wish will probably come true.
