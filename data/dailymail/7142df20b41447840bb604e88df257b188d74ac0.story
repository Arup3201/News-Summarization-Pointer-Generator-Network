An epileptic who ‘played Russian roulette’ with other people’s lives had a fit at the wheel and caused a crash that killed a grandmother.

Philip Chapman, 56, suffered  regular blackouts but told the DVLA they had stopped to avoid losing his driving licence.

The self-employed electrician was in his van in Southend, Essex, when he had a fit, shunting the car in front of him into the path of another vehicle.

The driver of that car, Linda  Brooks, 68, from Hockley, Essex, suffered massive injuries and died a fortnight later in hospital.

Her two-year-old grandson, Alfie, had a serious head injury and still suffers from psychological problems.

Chapman, of Rayleigh, Essex, was jailed for six years for causing death by dangerous driving and grievous bodily harm. He was banned from driving for life.

After the hearing, Mrs Brooks’s husband, Michael, 71, a retired company manager, said: ‘It is murder when you go out driving when you shouldn’t. He will be out on licence in three years and can carry on with his life.’

Chapman was sentenced at Basildon Crown Court on Thursday after admitting the charges at a previous hearing. The court heard he had suffered fits since childhood but was not diagnosed with epilepsy until a car crash in 1999. His licence was revoked but he successfully applied for it to be returned in 2003.

In 2006 he declared he had not had any fits, when in fact he had had three, including one while driving.

The fatal crash happened in September last year.Inspector Damon Bainbridge, of Essex Police, said Chapman felt he ‘needed’ to drive because he was self-employed. ‘He was in fact playing Russian  roulette as he could have become ill at any time,’ he said.

Judge Christopher Mitchell said: 'You knew something was wrong with you and you deliberately chose to ignore the warning. You did not go back to your GP you did not consider stopping driving completely. This was criminally irresponsible.'
