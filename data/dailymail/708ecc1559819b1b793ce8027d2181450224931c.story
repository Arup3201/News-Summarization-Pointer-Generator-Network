Lawyers for a Mexican drug cartel enforcer currently facing trial in the U.S. for the murder of two American citizens are attempting to get their man freed on the grounds that police south of the border used torture to get a confession from him.

Arturo Gallegos Castrellon, 32, is accused of killing two Americans, an employee at the consulate in Juarez and her husband, during a March 2010 drive-by shooting.

Attorneys for Castellon, who is also suspected of killing thousands of people in Juarez, claim he only admitted his guilt after he was tortured for three days by Mexican police who shocked his testicles and raped his wife.

A federal judge ruled last month that Castrellon’s confession can’t be suppressed, but his attorneys are now planning to challenge that ruling before a jury.

‘Americans are aware that suspects are tortured in Mexico, but I don't think they really know to what extent,’ defense attorney Randolph Ortega told Fox News.

Consulate employee Lesley Enriquez, 35, and her husband, El Paso County Sheriff's Detention officer Arthur Haycock Redelfs, were gunned down after they left a children’s party. Their one-year-old baby was found unharmed in the back seat of their car.

Authorities believe the victims were mistaken for rival gang members. They claim that Castrellon heads the Barrio Azteca gang, who act as enforcers for drug cartels.

Castrellon, 32, was arrested and interrogated by Mexican police on November 26, 2010.

He alleges his testicles were shocked with an electric device, he was hanged by his arms and beaten and his wife was tortured and raped by Mexican agents before he was handed over to FBI agents in Mexico City.

There is no indication the FBI took part in the alleged torture, but Ortega claims the confession his client made to FBI Special Agent Lorenzo Perez was ‘the product of torture at the hands of Mexican officials and improper psychological pressure by the FBI agents.’

U.S. District Court Judge Kathleen Cardone denied the suppression of Gallegos Castrellon’s confession last month, but Ortega hopes an American jury will refuse to convict a suspect if it believes a confession was coerced via torture.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Cooley said even if a jury discounts the confession, there’s plenty of evidence to convict Castrellon.

‘We are not simply relying on a confession in this case,' Cooley told Fox.

The arrest of Castrellon and others allegedly involved in the shootings has coincided with a dramatic decline in Juarez’s murder rate.

Since the arrest of Castrellon, also known as 'El Farmero' and 'El Benny,' the murder rate in the violent city plummeted from 3,622 in 2010 to 2,086 in 2011, then 751 in 2012.

Castrellon's trial is scheduled to begin on February 3 in El Paso Federal Court.
