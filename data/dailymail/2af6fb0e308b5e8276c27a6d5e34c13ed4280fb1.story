A second controlled explosion was carried out at a parish council chairman's house yesterday after officers called to a domestic dispute found an arsenal of weapons.

Jim Arnold, 49, was arrested last Sunday on suspicion of actual bodily harm after a report that he had attacked his wife in the quiet village of Wyverstone, Suffolk.

But when officers searched the home they allegedly found a secret hoard of deadly automatic guns, including an Uzi sub machine gun and an AK-47 assault rifle.

Probe: Police in Wyverstone, near Stowmarket, Suffolk, following the arrest of the parish council chairman

Since then armed police and a bomb 
squad have been scouring the house, which he shared with his wife Lyn, 
45, for explosives and ammunition.

Yesterday,
 a second controlled explosion was carried out on a ‘potentially 
dangerous item’ in a field next to the house, after a first explosion on 
Monday. A cordon is still in place at the home and officers remain on 
scene.

Arnold, who has been 
chairman of Wyverstone parish council for around seven years, has been 
charged with four counts of possessing prohibited weapons.

Fellow
 councillor Eddie Gale, 74, claimed Arnold was in the final stages of 
terminal cancer. He said: ‘Last year he told people he had five months 
to live - so the cancer is pretty advanced by now.’

Andy
 Mellen, the vice chairman of Wyverstone parish council, said: 'Jim 
Arnold is a diligent council chairman. He is well known in the community
 and has served the village well in various ways for many years.'

'It is no secret that Jim is very ill and only has weeks or months to live'

Another
 local, who asked not to be named, said: 'It is no secret that Jim is very
 ill and only has weeks or months to live. He was a legitimate firearms 
holder and had an interest in guns for many years.'

Arnold
 appeared before magistrates in Ipswich on Monday charged with two 
counts of assault and four counts of possession of a prohibited weapon.

He
 entered no plea to the weapons charges and was deemed too ill to enter 
pleas to two charges of assault. The charges relate to the Israeli-made 
Uzi, an AK-47, a self-loading rifle and a bolt action shotgun.

Response team: Controlled explosions were carried out in the area of Suffolk following a police raid

Interest: One local resident in Wyverstone said 'everyone in the village is wondering what's going on'

A
 45-year-old woman from the Stowmarket area, who was arrested on 
suspicion of possession of a prohibited firearm, has been bailed until 
May 21.

'Everyone in the village is wondering what's going on'

Anne Hornsblow, who 
lives near Arnold's home with her husband Rob and their children, said: 
'Everyone in the village is wondering what's going on.

'There's
 a lot more talking going on and everyone seems to be taking their dogs 
for a walk outside our house to see what's been happening.'

A
 Suffolk Police spokesman said: ‘Police would like to reassure residents
 that there is no risk to the general public and that controlled 
explosions such as these are standard procedure when dealing with 
potentially dangerous items.’
