One of Tony Abbott's top ministers has begged him to save ABC television production in his home state of South Australia following government funding cuts to the national broadcaster.

Education Minister Christopher Pyne, whose electorate of Sturt covers Adelaide, penned a letter to the Prime Minister urging him to overhaul the way the government funds the ABC so shows made in the state won't get cancelled, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. 

ABC managing director, Mark Scott, revealed last month the Adelaide studios would close after the government slashed $254 million from the broadcaster's budget over the next five years.

In his letter, Mr Pyne lists the shows produced in Adelaide including the top-rating and awards winning Dream Build, which he says is listed in the top 12 Australian shows. 

Mr Pyne said that almost one million people tuned in to watch Adelaide-made Do Yourself A Favour just one day before the closure of the studio was announced. 

The Education Minister told Mr Abbott he had written to the ABC boss several times asking him to reconsider his plans to stop production.

'But it appears the board is using the savings announced by (Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull) as an excuse to make the ABC more Sydney and Melbourne focussed,' he wrote. 

He said popular ABC shows like Dream Build, Po's Kitchen and The Cook And The Chef have been produced from the  Adelaide studios and jobs would be lost.

'By moving ABC TV elsewhere it will incur unnecessary costs and remove the efficient and innovative production unit from South Australia. ABC South Australia has a record for low-cost, high-quality, high-efficiency production,' he wrote.

Mr Pyne has called on the Prime Minister to return to tiered government funding for regional production.
