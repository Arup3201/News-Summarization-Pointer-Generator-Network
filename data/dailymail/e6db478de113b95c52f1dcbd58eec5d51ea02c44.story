Watching Kell Brook win his world title against Shawn Porter on Saturday night ranks right up there with my best nights in this sport. It was just incredible.

I have seen up close what he has gone through to get to this point. He has had world-title fights postponed and people have doubted his desire. They have asked whether he has the stomach for it and whether he has the hunger to be a champion. He has proved everyone wrong and shown just how special he is.

He came of age in that ring and great things lie in wait for him, including Amir Khan. I am looking at next spring or summer in a fight, maybe at Wembley, that will be just as big as Froch-Groves. I’ve started talks on it, but more of that later.

Before the fight against Porter, Kell was very quiet. I’d never really seen him like that - I felt he was very nervous but I was wrong. He was just totally calm, ready to go out and get what he has always dreamed of. It was pure focus. 

We had an hour chat in his room on the morning of the fight. I explained what victory would mean and how it would change his life. I told him he must not let this opportunity pass him by. 

That’s the beautiful thing about boxing - after all the training and all the years of dreaming, you’ve got 36 minutes to make it happen.

I am a great believer in things happening for a reason and perhaps that is what happened with Kell when his world title shot against Devon Alexander was called off. 

Maybe it took missing that fight to realise just how much he wanted a title. He came back hungrier, desperate to get what he deserved.

He trained so hard for this fight. He comfortably made the weight, which is all you need to know really for such a huge welterweight. And on the night he was brilliant.

He put so much pressure on himself. In his head he was thinking his whole life led to that moment. I was saying the same to him in the dressing room. But he handled the pressure we all put on him so well.

I was sitting with Oscar De La Hoya and he felt Kell won with ease. It was controlled, professional, brilliant. He executed every part of his gameplan. For me, he proved he is special – one of the absolute best talents in world boxing.

Khan is suddenly very interested in a fight. We are too. People from Showtime, who show Khan’s fights in the US, came into the dressing room after Kell won and said ‘Let’s talk’. Other US broadcasters have also been on - it’s exciting times.

I think this fight can be made, but people have to put arrogance and ego to one side. Before, when we offered Khan £3m to fight, he didn’t fancy it. Kell had a reasonable name and no title. He has a huge name and a world title now.

That changes the negotiating position a lot, but this is such a big fight everyone can do well out of it, so long as Khan doesn’t demand an unrealistic split we should make it happen.

I want to make this fight and I think it will be huge. Maybe Floyd Mayweather will feature down the line. Kell is certainly in that reckoning now.

Kell is next out on December 6 in Sheffield and we will now start looking at opponents. Andre Berto, Juan Manuel Marquez, Brandon Rios, Josesito Lopez are all names being thrown in the pot but it is very early days.

We will talk over the options and go from there. Kell has a great future and I am so happy for him.

The next big thing: Brook vs Khan could be just like Froch-Groves (left) - and Floyd Mayweather could lie in wait

Joshua sparring with the best 

Anthony Joshua had a call to go sparring with Wladimir Klitschko and he is out in Austria now. I discussed it with him and said he simply had to go. Wladimir is one of the greatest heavyweights in history and the best of his generation. 

This is a wonderful opportunity for AJ to see how the best do it – how they live, eat, train. He will gain a huge amount from this experience. I am looking forward to a progress report as I’m sure Anthony can hold his own. Expect him to look sensational on September 13 at the Phones 4 U Arena.

Smith vs Groves would be a highlight of next year 

On Kell’s fight card in the US, there were great wins for Callum Smith and Luke Campbell, two of the best prospects in world boxing. They keep destroying whoever I put them in with. For Callum, he will next fight on October 4 in Leeds but I can reveal here that a fight I have one eye on is against George Groves next Spring or summer.

Groves is making his comeback in September and I think a fight with Smith could be a highlight of 2015. Believe me when I say he will be ready.

Campbell will fight on October 25 in Hull, on a card featuring Tommy Coyle. Both of them have big, tough fights that I will announce next week.

Don't rule out a return to the ring for Kellie 

It’s never dull in boxing, as demonstrated by Kellie Maloney and Audley Harrison going into the Big Brother house. Who knows what will happen next? Since wanting an apparent quiet life, Kellie was seen at a show in Germany last weekend and is now taking part in one of the biggest reality TV shows in the World. Could a comeback be on the cards? Stranger things have happened!

RIP Glyn 

I would like to pay my respects here to Glyn Leach, the editor of Boxing Monthly who died this week. He was a lovely man and did so much to help me in the early part of my career. He loved the sport, knew it as well as anyone and was always great for a chat. He will be sorely missed.
