Three men dressed in Ku Klux Klan garb, a black niqab and a motorbike helmet were refused entry after attempting to walk into Australia's Parliament House on Monday.

Identifying themselves as 'Faceless', Sergio Redegalli, Nick Folkes and Victor Waterson told reporters at the scene that they were protesting in favour of a national burqa ban.

They clarified that they wanted all facial coverings to be banned in public spaces for cultural and security reasons. 

Their bizarre demonstration comes one week after the government announced its decision  to overturn the ban on niqab's and burqas being worn inside  Parliament House.

Three men from 'Faceless' attempted to enter Parliament House as part of a protest on Monday 

They were dressed in Ku Klux Klan garb, a niqab and a motorbike helmet 

The men also stated that they 'couldn't care less' how Muslim women would feel about their stunt, according to the Herald Sun.

Upon entering Parliament House, the men were asked to remove their garb by security who refused to grant them entrance.

'It's fantastic that we were not allowed in,' Mr Redegalli said, according to the ABC.

However he later added: 'It seems that you're allowed to wear a full-faced covering into Parliament if you're a Muslim woman, but no other group is allowed to have that same privilege.

'We, as males, are not allowed to wear any face coverings in Parliament House.'

Mr Redegalli, who was dressed in the KKK outfit, revealed that he was also wearing a niqab beneath his white hood. 

It's not the Newtown business-owner's first time protesting against burqas being worn in public spaces. In 2011 Mr Redegalli was criticized for an offensive mural he painted outside his shop that read 'say no to burqas'.

The three men have been slammed on social media for their tasteless protest, with one Twitter user writing: 'BREAKING: Absolute dropkicks at Parliament House'.

A spokesperson for security at Parliament House told Daily Mail Australia: 'In this instance, the Parliamentary Security Service followed procedures for screening visitors entering Parliament. The visitors were requested to remove the items obscuring their faces as the items were deemed to be protest paraphernalia.

‘Protest paraphernalia’ may be used in the Authorised Assembly Area, but not in other areas of the precinct.'

Their demonstration comes one week after the Department of Parliamentary Services (DPS) announced that the ban on face coverings being worn in public areas of Parliament House had been dumped.

Introduced in early October, the ban forced anyone with a face covering to sit behind soundproof glass instead of in the public galleries.

Instead,  face coverings will now have to be removed temporarily at the front door so that staff can 'identify any person who may have been banned from entering Parliament House or who may be known, or discovered, to be a security risk.'

The opposition welcomed the overturning of the ban.

'In 2014 for two weeks, the official policy of the Australian Parliament was to practice segregation and we need to ensure this does not happen again,' senior opposition lawmaker Tony Burke said in a statement.
