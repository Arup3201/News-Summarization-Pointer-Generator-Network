Surgeons in Spain have removed a giant tumour from a woman’s stomach that was 17 inches long and weighed 3st 9lb.

The doctors at Torrevieja Hospital, in eastern Spain, say the tumour was attached to the 47-year-old patient’s womb.

Dr Eduardo Cazorla, head of the hospital’s Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, said that in his 20-year career had never dealt with a similar case.

A 3st 9lb tumour (pictured) was removed from a 47-year-old woman's abdomen during a two hour operation in Spain. The tumour was 41cm long and reached from her pubic bone to her sternum

The surgical team say giant gynaecological tumours – defined as those weighing more than 1st 8lb – are very rare and that only five similar cases have ever been reported in scientific literature.

The patient was referred to the hospital by her GP after suffering weight gain and pain in her stomach.

The 55lb tumour was so large it was also causing her bowel problems, difficulty sleeping, breathing problems and discomfort while walking.

Doctors carried out a series of tests and found a huge cystic tumour which was 41cm long.

It stretched from her pubic bone to her sternum.

During an operation, surgeons successfully removed the tumour as well as the patient’s womb, ovaries and fallopian tubes.

Since the surgery the patient has made a full recovery and there are no signs of the tumour returning. Image shows her stomach before the tumour was removed

The operation took just two hours and the tumour was found to be benign.

The woman spent five days in hospital and another 20 days recovering at home.

She has now made a full recovery.

She is still visiting the hospital for regular examinations but there are currently no signs of the tumour returning.
