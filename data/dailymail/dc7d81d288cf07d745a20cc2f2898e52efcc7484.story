President Barack Obama says he takes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 'at his word' for saying there'd never be an independent Palestinian state as long as he's in office, but still believes a two-state solution is the key to peace in the area.

Netanyahu has softened his position since making the comment just before he won re-election last week.

He said in a statement on Monday that a Palestinian state would not be established on his watch.

But the change in tone doesn't seem to be swaying Obama, who said he spoke to Netanyahu on the phone on Thursday.

Rift: President Barack Obama says the U.S. will evaluate other options for establishing peace between the Israelis and Palestinians as a result of Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's rejection of longstanding U.S. policy

'I did indicate to him that we continue to believe that a two-state solution is the only way for the long-term security of Israel, if it wants to stay both a Jewish state and democratic,' Obama told The Huffington Post on Saturday. 

'And I indicated to him that given his statements prior to the election, it is going to be hard to find a path where people are seriously believing that negotiations are possible.'

Obama says the U.S. will evaluate other options for establishing peace between the Israelis and Palestinians as a result of Netanyahu's rejection of longstanding U.S. policy.

Obama says he indicated to Netanyahu when they spoke this week that the U.S. continues to believe a two-state solution is the only way to keep Israel secure.

The comments were Obama's first on the Israeli election outcome. 

He spoke in an interview with The Huffington Post.

'We take him at his word when he said that it wouldn't happen during his prime ministership, and so that's why we've got to evaluate what other options are available to make sure that we don't see a chaotic situation in the region,' the president said.

The Huff Post reported  Obama said he was most disappointment at Netanyahu's Election Day warning about Arab Israeli voters going to the polls 'in droves.'

'We indicated that that kind of rhetoric was contrary to what is the best of Israel's traditions,' Obama said in the interview.

'That although Israel was founded based on the historic Jewish homeland and the need to have a Jewish homeland, Israeli democracy has been premised on everybody in the country being treated equally and fairly.

'And I think that that is what's best about Israeli democracy.

'If that is lost, then I think that not only does it give ammunition to folks who don't believe in a Jewish state, but it also I think starts to erode the meaning of democracy in the country.'
