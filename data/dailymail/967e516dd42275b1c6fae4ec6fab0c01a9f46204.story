Police in China have decided not to take action against a mother who savagely beat her six-year-old son with a wire coat hanger after they agreed he had been 'naughty' for not doing his homework.

Xiao Bing's injuries were discovered by a teacher at the nursery school he attends in Jiangmen city in China's southern Guangdong province while he was getting changed for a sports lesson.

But despite the teacher reporting the wounds to the authorities, Xiao Bing's mother will not face arrest after local police said the injuries were not as bad as they look, adding that they have told the woman not to beat her child so severely in future.

Horrific: Xiao Bing's injuries were discovered by a teacher while he was getting changed for a sports lesson. The six-year-old said his mother beat him with a wire coat hanger for not doing his homework

Shocked by the nature of Xiao Bing's injuries, the teacher took photographs of them on her mobile phone and handed them over to the police.

The child said his mother had beaten him with a wire coat hanger because he had not done his homework that day.

But a police spokesman said that the 
injuries simply looked worse than they were and that it had been enough 
to have a word with the mother and to tell her not to be so severe in 
the future.

'The boy's mother and father are unhappy 
about his performance at school, saying that he is a naughty boy who 
often fails to do his homework and needed to be taught a lesson,' police spokesman Hu Lung said.

Awareness: The teacher posted the images online to highlight the abuse of children by Chinese parents who put their offspring under enormous pressure to perform at school

'His mother had hit him after discovering that once again he had not done his homework on time.'

Furious that the police had done nothing, the teacher posted the images online to highlight abuse of children by Chinese parents who put their offspring under enormous pressure to perform at school.

Police said that the boy had been taken to hospital for treatment, but that the bruises and red marks quickly reduced in size and he was allowed home the same day.

Punishment: Wen Yuan, 47, chained up his son, Chuang, 24 (pictured) because he believed his thieving habits had brought shame on the family and was concerned he would soon end up in prison

Last week a family in nearby Jiangxi province admitted chaining their son to his bed as a punishment for his constant stealing.Â 

Father Wen Yuan, 47, chained up his son, Chuang, 24, because he believed his thieving habits had brought shame on the family.

As a result he tied his son to his bedroom in their house in Xibianban village in south China's Jiangxi province, for fear that if he didn't stop his son from stealing, he would soon end up in jail.
