Describing Vicky Pryce as a ‘quivering jelly’ bullied into taking speeding points for her Cabinet minister husband Chris Huhne was ‘to stop living in the real world’, it was claimed yesterday.

She was in fact a ‘powerful, intelligent woman’ and her claims that she was coerced by Huhne into perverting the course of justice were ‘bare-faced lies’, Southwark Crown Court heard.

As her trial drew to its close, 
prosecutor Andrew Edis QC accused the economist of being a ‘manipulative
and deceitful’ woman who conjured up a ‘stage-managed performance’ for 
the court.

'Utterly humiliated': Vicky Pryce, the former wife of ex-MP Chris Huhne arrived at Southwark Crown Court on Tuesday, where the court heard details of Huhne's affair

By contrast, Pryce’s defence counsel 
Julian Knowles QC presented her as a loyal wife who had been humiliated 
by her husband’s affair with his assistant, Carina Trimingham, and then 
effectively given no choice but to accept his speeding points.

He said Huhne used the lesbian public 
profile of his assistant – who had previously been in a civil 
partnership with a woman – to ‘allay the suspicions’ of his wife that 
she was his mistress, it was claimed yesterday. Jurors were told Pryce 
was left ‘utterly humiliated’ when the Lib Dem MP left her for his PR 
adviser and manager of his campaign to lead his party,

Julian Knowles, QC, defending Pryce, 
said the affair attracted ‘salacious’ attention and urged jurors to 
consider how they would feel if their marriage was ‘put under the 
microscope’ and ‘laughed at’.

Pryce, 60, admits accepting Huhne’s 
speeding points in 2003 but pleads not guilty to perverting the course 
of justice on the grounds of marital coercion – meaning that her husband
left her with ‘no real choice’ but to commit the crime.

Summing up the case against her, 
however, Mr Edis said: ‘You are not talking about a woman who is under 
the thumb of anybody. You are talking about someone who has had a 
brilliant career because throughout she has made good decisions.

‘To describe such a person as being deprived of real choice is to stop living in the real world.’

Disgraced Lib Dem Chris Huhne, with his new partner Carina Trimingham, faced the media outside Southwark Crown Court this month

She claims Huhne bullied her into 
action because it was crucial to him winning his party’s nomination for 
the relatively safe Lib Dem seat of Eastleigh.

Mr Edis told the jury of eight women 
and four men: ‘In a sense she is trying to pervert the course of justice
again, but this time by fooling you.’

He added: ‘These are bare-faced lies 
designed to give a false impression about her. She is not a vulnerable, 
weak person, she is very clever.’

Mr Edis said she was driven by revenge
after Huhne left her for Miss Trimingham. He said she had supported him
in his bid to become an MP and through two attempts to claim leadership
of his party.

He added: ‘If what has happened to him
had not happened he would probably be deputy prime minister now.’ The 
court was told Pryce wanted to strike at Huhne ‘from a very safe 
distance’ by planting the stories of his deception in the newspapers 
without identifying herself.

But when that failed she turned to 
‘Plan B’, which was to claim she was coerced into helping him and 
therefore not guilty of a crime.

The court heard that swapping the speeding points was a ‘useful family arrangement’ and benefited both Huhne and Pryce.

Huhne was working as an MEP and was 
often away from home and Pryce wanted him to win a seat in Parliament. 
She was struggling to juggle her family and work roles and if he lost 
his licence she would have to ‘chauffeur’ him around.

Mr Edis accused Pryce of making up her
claim that Huhne forced her to sign the speeding summons by confronting
her with a pen in his hand.

He said: ‘Do you think there is any 
prospect of this woman having been reduced to such a quivering jelly 
when she sent the form – that she had no real choice?’

Mr Knowles said that if the jury considered the evidence properly they would find her ‘obviously not guilty’.

He said she was put in an ‘impossible 
situation’ by her husband and had ‘no realistic choice’ but to sign the 
form and take the points.

The trial continues.
