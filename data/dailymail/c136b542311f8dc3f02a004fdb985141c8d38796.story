It seems Farrah Abraham has learned the hard way that getting on the wrong side of Charlie Sheen is not a good idea.

The angry Anger Management actor has slammed the Teen Mom star in a rather humiliating open letter.

Farrah shared text messages between the pair which showed them planning a date, and Charlie is furious at her for leaking the conversation.

A bit embarrassing: Charlie Sheen has slammed Farrah Abraham in an open letter published on TMZ.com

The 47-year-old branded the 22-year-old a ‘desperate guzzler of stagnant douche agua’ in a note published on TMZ.com.

Charlie told the former reality star: 'I truly do not recall giving you permission to globally reveal any communication between us. congrats on surviving your lobotomy and an even bigger congratz on the recent attempt at porn.'

He went on to tell her ‘your daughter must be so proud’ and expressed very sternly that he never wants to hear from her again.

‘Please send my number to middle earth and if allowed, eagerly follow it into said abyss and slam the door behind you,’ he wrote.

Furious: Charlie is annoyed at Farrah, pictured on Wednesday, for sharing text messages exchanged between them

'The world will collectively sigh as the pungent memory of you vanishes into the pedestrian troposphere of lame-suck and zero-life. Oh and I'm sure they'll wave the cover charge when they see your tranny-boobs and five o'clock shadow.'

It came after Farrah reached out to the actor in May saying she would like to meet him and score a role on his show Anger Management.

Farrah sent the star a longwinded and frankly embarrassing series of text messages, one of which said; ‘Just wanted to say I was excited to meet you if anger management ever ends up booking me, but idk if that will happen …

‘So I just felt like saying your super funny and would love to meet you at some point & I’m in town alot & hopefully soon will move to the area and maybe we can meet up for a play date with our children or if your cool just for coffee and relaxing let me know. [sic]’

Not happy: Charlie told the Teen Mom star to 'send his number to middle earth' and added that she should 'follow it'

Farrah added: ‘This week I’m doing appearances & other work and could only meet later so – All the best & hope your having a great week.’

Charlie seemed keen on the idea at the time, and wrote back: ‘You sound fabulous! Coffee is for amateurs and grandma… would love to get together!!’

The redheaded sex tape star followed up a few days later, asking Charlie if he wanted to come with her to a party with some ‘porn star ppl’ if he felt ‘comfortable’.

While Charlie may have been open to the idea of meeting Farrah a month ago, the former Two And A Half Men star has done a complete 180.

And his colourfully worded letter has in turn irritated Farrah, who responded to Charlie via a letter on Radar Online.

Forward: Farrah asked Charlie, seen with ex-wife Denise last month, for a playdate with their children, or if he wanted to meet for coffee

'That's right Charlie you never did tell
 me I could share my own texts with anyone – it looks like you have 
control issues because I can do whatever I want and I have nothing to 
hide maybe you do,' she wrote. 'I think all the drugs, fame, money, 
alcohol, and whores messed with your head because your bashing response 
to me is really uncalled for and makes zero sense.

'You sound like you have mental 
issues, (hints maybe you need some anger management counseling) given 
your disgusting lash out towards my body and my relationship with my 
daughter which each are both the epitome of perfection.'

The star continued: 'So for a old 
train wreck like yourself you sit in your own pedestrian troposphere of 
lame-suck and zero-life, enjoy your dwindle and I wish you all the best 
at being a good male figure for your children who really need a good 
male role model in their lives.

'As well I hope those call girls, 
pornstars, and goddesses you have around and pay are worthy because its 
sad you can not have a stable relationship to show your children a good 
example.

Never going to happen: The 22-year-old said she wanted to guest star on Charlie's show Anger Management

Farrah added: 'I was only being 
friendly with Charlie because Anger Management contacted my rep and so I
 thought it would be good to reach out and spend some civil quality time
 apparently that’s not possible and I will be strictly professional and 
not speak to other talent in the future because I do not need to be 
bothered by their crazy personal lives and horrible personalities. I 
have a bright future ahead of myself I do not have time for this 
nonsense of drama.'

Charlie’s explosive letter is not the only thing helping Farrah stay in the spotlight following the release of her sex tape, Farrah Superstar: Back Door Teen Mom.

The mother-of-one has also just had a second breast augmentation surgery, and kindly brought the cameras into the operating theatre with her.

Farrah replaced her C-cup saline implants with larger D-cups filled with silicone in a surgery which took place on May 31, just three days after she turned 22 (the FDA's minimum age for a woman to get silicone implants), according to In Touch.

Now, she says, 'I look more natural. I want to look my best. And I’m looking amazing.'

Treating herself: Farrah went under the knife for a second breast augmentation surgery three days after her 22nd birthday
