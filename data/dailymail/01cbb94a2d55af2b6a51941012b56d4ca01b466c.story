President Obama has praised Australia's gun laws, saying that the U.S.'s high rate of mass shooting 'makes no sense'.

Speaking at a Q&A at the White House, just hours after a shooting at an Oregon high school that claimed the life of one student, the president said that his 'biggest frustration' about his time in office is that he has not been able to make more progress with tightening gun laws.

He commended the changes to gun laws introduced in Australia in 1996 after the Port Arthur massacre, which claimed the lives of 35 people.

'A couple of decades ago, Australia had a mass shooting, similar to Columbine or Newtown, and Australia just said “Well that's it, we're not seeing that again.” And basically imposed very severe, tough gun laws and they haven't had a mass shooting since,' said President Obama.

'Now we have a different tradition, we have a second amendment, we have historically respected gun rights, I respect gun rights, but the fact that we couldn't even get a background check in… it makes no sense.

'Our levels of gun violence are off the charts, there's no advanced, developed country on earth that would put up with this,' he said.

President Obama was responding to a question sent in by Nick Dineen, who attends the University of California, Santa Barbara and knew one of the six victims killed in the shooting there last month.

The president said he had been greatly frustrated by the influence of the NRA over Congress and things would not change until there was a 'fundamental shift in public opinion'.

'The country has to do some soul-searching about this,' he said.

The most recent U.S. school shooting occurred at Reynolds High School in Troutdale, Oregon at 8am on Tuesday local time. One student was killed and a teacher was injured, and it is believed the shooter died from a self-inflicted wound.

Australia introduced a gun buy-back scheme in October 1996, in response to public outrage at the Port Arthur massacre, when Martin Bryant, a disturbed 28-year-old man, killed 35 people and wounded 23 more with guns he said he purchased from a dealer without the required gun license.

The scheme concluded in September 1997, during that year the buyback scheme resulted in the purchase and destruction of more than 630,000 guns.

Gun-related homicides dropped by 27 percent from 1996 when the buy-back scheme was implemented to 2010. Suicides involving firearms also dropped significantly.

The U.S. has the highest rate of gun-related death of any developed country in the world, with 10 deaths per 100,000 people, whereas Australia has one death per 100,000 people, according to research from Gunpolicy.org.
