Professional fire-fighters who have fought blazes in the Channel Tunnel for the past 18 years are to be replaced by untrained security guards, it emerged today.

It follows a breakdown in contract talks between Eurotunnel, which manages the undersea link, and the Pas-de-Calais fire service (SDIS).

The company was trying to renegotiate a 2m pounds plus annual deal with SDIS but the French fire-fighters pulled out.

A Eurotunnel spokesman said they 'regretted' the SDIS decision, adding: 'We have never skimped on security and are looking for the best solutions to take over the SDIS work.'

The last major fire in the Channel Tunnel was on September 11, 2008, when a blaze broke out on Eurotunnel shuttle train carrying a number of lorries and drivers.

It lasted for 16 hours and reached temperatures of 1000 C, yet swift action by the Calais fire-fighters meant only 14 people out of 32 on the train suffered minor injuries, including smoke inhalation.

Repairs to the tunnel cost more than £50 million, with new emergency warning measures introduced afterwards.

There were two earlier blazes - the first in 1996, two years after the tunnel opened, and one in 2006.

The Calais fire brigade has a base just 10 minutes from the French entrance to the Channel Tunnel, at Coquelles, with staff able to mobilise almost immediately.

This was one of the main reasons that Eurotunnel has hired some 40 permanent fire-fighters at Coquelles for the past 18 years.

'These few minutes are crucial to dealing with any fire,' said a brigade source. 'We acted in seconds following the blaze in 2008.'

Negotiations between Eurotunnel and the Calais brigade have taken place every two years, with Eurotunnel regularly praising their 'remarkable dedication and professionalism'

Now Onet, a Marseille-based security company, is said to be ready to take over fire-fighting duties from the Calais brigade from January 1st.

They have already begun advertising for staff, calling for men and women who are 'serious, calm and - ideally - have done some work as volunteer fire-fighters or five years in industrial fire prevention.'

However, there is no expectation that any of the new guards will be professional fire-fighters.
