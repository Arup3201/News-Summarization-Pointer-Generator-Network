It was the place Lee Harvey Oswald called home in the weeks before he assassinated President John F Kennedy nearly 50 years ago.

And now the boarding house in Dallas, where Oswald lived in a tiny room while working in the city's main book depository, is being put up for sale.

The property's current owner Patricia Hall, 61, said she decided to put it on the market as the 50th anniversary of the assassination in Dallas on November 22 1963, approaches.

Killing: Oswald is seen here being led through Dallas Police Station after being arrested on suspicion of assassinating President John F Kennedy. He was later shot and killed himself by Jack Ruby

The
house has been in Ms Hall's family since about 1942, but she has 
decided that it is finally time to let it go - as long as a buyer wants 
to preserve it and offers the right price.

'I
understand the significance of the history of this house,' said Ms Hall.

'It doesn't matter if you believe in a conspiracy or the lone 
gunman. The fact is that Lee Harvey Oswald lived here.'

Time: The front porch of 1026 North Beckley Avenue. Oswald rented a room at the guesthouse from Ms Hall's grandmother, Gladys Johnson

Oswald rented the 5-by-14 foot room from Ms Hall's grandmother, Gladys Johnson. He stayed at 
the red brick house with white trim during the week while working in his 
new job at the Texas School Book Depository, and on the weekends he 
returned to the suburb of Irving where his wife lived.

Oswald briefly returned to the house 
on November 22, 1963, about 30 minutes after President Kennedy was fatally shot in 
downtown Dallas. Ms Johnson's housekeeper told the Warren Commission that 
Oswald hurriedly entered, grabbed a jacket and headed back out into the neighborhood.

Soon after, Oswald fatally shot Officer J.D. Tippit, then was arrested at the Texas Theatre.

Hall said her grandmother, an admirer of President Kennedy, was saddenned by her connection to Oswald.

'My grandmother was very embarrassed 
and humiliated that her home would be associated with someone that would
do something like that. She began getting death threats. She received a
lot of hate mail,' Ms Hall said.

But
Ms Johnson also refused to vilify Oswald, known to her as O.H. Lee, who 
kept his $8-a-week room tidy and was even granted access to the fridge.

'She would only be true to what her observations were,' said Ms Hall.

Fay
Puckett, Ms Hall's mother, ran the boarding house after Ms Johnson's death. 
Neither woman ever wanted to indulge sightseers, but Puckett did 
allow Oliver Stone to film scenes for his 1991 movie JFK there.

Not
long after her mother's death in 2008, Ms Hall started letting people in 
to see the room, displaying a donation box to help with restorations.

'People are curious. They want to see where he lived. They want to see how he lived,' she said.

Ms Hall
said she' has been considering selling the house for years, but decided 
the time was right as this year marks the 50th anniversary of JFK's
assassination in downtown Dallas. She said she hopes the timing helps get the 
best price possible.

Decision: Ms Hall said she has been considering selling the house for years, but decided the time was right as this year marks the 50th anniversary of Kennedy's assassination

The 
50th anniversary has been gaining attention in recent months as everyone
from museum curators to musicians have embarked on projects to remember
the event.

The city of Dallas will hold a commemoration November 22 in 
Dealey Plaza, where Kennedy's motorcade was passing as shots rang out.

'I decided if there was going to be a right time, this was the right time,' she said.

David Preziosi, executive director of Preservation Dallas, said the home is 'part of the whole story of what happened that day. We think it's pretty significant in terms of telling the story of the assassination,' Preziosi said.

The house in the Oak Cliff neighborhood just southwest of downtown Dallas has four bedrooms and one bathroom on its main floor and five bedrooms and one bathroom in a basement. There's also a two-story garage apartment with eight bedrooms and two bathrooms.

The list price of the house, built in 1935, will be disclosed when it goes on the market Saturday. Ms Hall, a seventh-grader when President Kennedy was assassinated, can remember Oswald breaking up a fight between her brothers in the front yard of the house.

'He separated them and sat them down on the porch and sat between them and said, `I want to tell you something and I want you to listen to me.

'You are brothers and you have to look out for each other, you have to love and never do anything that would harm another human being,' Ms Hall said.
