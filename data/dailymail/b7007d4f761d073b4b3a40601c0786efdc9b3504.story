A total of 651 people have arrived in Australia from Ebola stricken West Africa in the past two months.

Border staff at Australia's international airports have assessed people from the four affected West African countries - Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, plus the Democratic Republic of the Congo, over fears they could have come into contact with the deadly disease.

However, the government does not know how many Australians are currently in Ebola affected West Africa, a source has revealed.

They explained that unless travellers register with the government’s Smart Traveller website before they fly then the government doesn't know where they are.

The Ebola epidemic has killed more than 3,400 people in West Africa, including Liberia (pictured), according to the World Health Organisation

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade  confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that 60 Australians are registered on the website as being in Guinea, Sierra Leona and Liberia at the moment.

Ebola screening measures are being ramped up at international airports around Australia after it was revealed eleven Australians have been tested and cleared for Ebola in recent weeks.

A spokesperson for the Australian Government Department of Health said the screening process commenced on 9 August.

'As of 1 October there had been 651 people interviewed, six of whom were referred for further consideration by human quarantine officers, none of whom required any specific action to be taken,' the spokesperson said.

'Of these six, three had been to funerals in Nigeria, but none of those people had died of Ebola and two were doctors returning from West Africa.

'All 651 who were interviewed were given a pamphlet outlining the symptoms they should look out for and the actions they should take if they develop symptoms.'

Cairns nurse Sue-Ellen Kovack, 57, was cleared of Ebola on Friday by initial tests after she returned from Sierra Leone with the Red Cross

Health authorities confirmed on Friday morning that Cairns nurse Sue-Ellen Kovack, 57, has been cleared of Ebola by initial tests.

The Red Cross nurse was tested for the deadly virus after she reported feeling a fever on her return from Sierra Leone where she was volunteering in the fight against Ebola.

But federal Health Minister Peter Dutton says she's not the only one who has undergone testing in recent weeks.

‘Already we've had 11 cases that have presented across the country that have all been negative,’ he told AAP in Brisbane.

‘We have put in place plans in major tertiary hospitals around the country that if we do have a positive case, we will be able to deal with that case.’

Like Ms Kovack, many Australians have travelled to West Africa to provide medical and humanitarian aid.

The Australian branch of Médecins Sans Frontières told Daily Mail Australia they currently have 24 volunteers and staff members from Australia and New Zealand in West Africa.

The chief medical officer, chief of the defence force and immigration department secretary have all advised the federal government on how to respond to the growing Ebola crisis around the world.

Initial screening is now able to be done at airports and passengers on planes coming from affected African countries are being given information about the disease.

‘That provides a world-class response and is probably ahead of the game where other developed countries are at the moment,’ Mr Dutton said.  

Banners have now been fixed in international airports to raise awareness of the symptoms of the deadly virus, and pamphlets distributed on some flights.

‘The Australian government has put in place additional measures to address the low risk of Ebola to Australia,’ a spokeswoman for the Australian Department of Health said on Friday.

All border agencies have been educated by the Department of Health to identify and quarantine any passengers presenting Ebola symptoms in flights or at airports.

The Department said very few people travel to Australia from West Africa, with no direct commercial flights from any of the affected countries.  

Mr Dutton pointed out Ebola is not spread like flu.

‘There needs to be an exchange of bodily fluids - of blood, of vomit or diarrhoea for example,’ Mr said.

Mr Dutton said the high fatality rate of around 48 per cent in the countries affected is in part due to health workers lacking the level of training of developed countries like Australia.

Funeral rituals for those killed by the virus are also contributing to the spread, he said.

‘For example, bodies are washed with water, the water is then consumed by loved ones of that person who has died from Ebola,’ he said.

‘And of course there is a rapid spread as a result.’

In the US, passengers arriving from Ebola-affected countries will be getting their temperatures taken at five airports as screening measures are bolstered in the coming days.
