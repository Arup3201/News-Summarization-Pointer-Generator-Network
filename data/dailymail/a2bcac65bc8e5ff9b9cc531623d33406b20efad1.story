A British car collector spent four times the expected price of a 1967 Ferrari because it was once owned by the King of Cool Steve McQueen.

The actor bought the Ferrari 275 GTB/4 while filming police drama Bullitt. In the film, his character Frank Bullitt is followed in his 1967 Ford Mustang Fastback by a black Dodge Charger in one of the best car chase scenes in Hollywood history.

McQueen insisted during filming that he would perform most of his own stunts, including the high-speed car chase.

Steve McQueen's old 1967 Ferrari 275 GTB/4 was sold at auction earlier this week by a British car enthusiast for £6 million - four times more than it was worth 

The stunning 165 mph Ferrari was bought by McQueen as he filmed Bullitt, which featured one of the most legendary car chase scenes in Hollywood history

Unlike the V8 in his film car, the Ferrari was powered by a magnificent 3.3 litre V12 engine producing 300bhp.

From a standing start, the car would hit 60mph in 6.5 seconds before reaching a top speed of 165mph. 

McQueen kept the car until 1971 when he sold it to fellow actor Guy Williams, who appeared in Zorro and Lost in Space. 

Vern Schuppan, an Australian former Le Mans winner, recently bought the car and asked Ferrari to return the car to how it looked when McQueen owned it.

The 165mph Ferrari, regarded as one of the finest classic sports cars, went under the hammer at RM Auctions' sale in Monterey, California.

Bidding opened up at $4 million, before a phone bidder offered $6 million. It then went to $7m before increasing in increments of $250,000.

At $8.5 million, the offer suddenly leapt to $9 million before the hammer went down at $9.25 million.

The final price, with a premium, was $10.1 million (£6 million) - which is around four times what someone would have paid for the car had it not been owned by The Great Escape star.

The 275 GTB/4 was one of the best looking Ferrari's ever made and was designed as a Grand Tourer, capable of being driven thousands of miles in speed and luxury

The car has leather bucket seats, wooden steering wheel and the famous Ferrari H gate gear shifter. The car has been restored immaculately by Ferrari specialists

The car is not fitted with a stereo as this would interfere with the sound from the v12 engine while there is even room in the back for two very short people

Max Girardo, managing director of RM Auctions in Europe, said: 'The Steve McQueen factor is simply immeasurable.

'There is nothing better to spend your money on than a Steve McQueen Ferrari.'

McQueen's Ferrari was controversially - and expensively - transformed from a coupe into a convertible after he sold it.

But Mr Schuppan, decided to spend a six-figure sum giving the car its McQueen factor back.

He gave it to Ferrari's Classiche department which restored the car to how it looked when the screen icon had owned it.

The staggering fee paid for the Ferrari is the latest example of the 'McQueen Factor', where people pay over the odds for cars owned by the late actor.

In 2011, his old Porsche 911 sold for £830,000 - more than 12 times its typical value.

The car has 14,243 miles on the clock, but having been owned by Steve McQueen, many of those miles would have been north of 100mph 

The car underwent a six-figure restoration. Max Girardo of RM Auctions said: 'There is nothing better to spend your money on than a Steve McQueen Ferrari' 

According to Mr Girardo, having Steve McQueen's name on a car's logbook increases the value of the vehicle several times over as he is still 'The King of Cool'

Mr Girardo had previously said the car 'ticks all the boxes when it comes to collectability'.

Under the bonnet of the Ferrari 275 GTB/4 is a 3.3-litre V12 engine which develops 300bhp. 

Ferrari said the McQueen 275 was 'one of the more interesting cars ever to leave the factory'.

While unconfirmed, it is thought the Ferrari has been sold to a very wealthy British car collector, who was bidding over the telephone.

However, the Brit was not Chris Evans, who has been in Monterey for the week.

But the Radio 2 presenter, who is known for his car collection, was involved in the record-breaking Ferrari 250 GTO auction on Thursday night.

Bonhams said he bid $30 million for the Ferrari, but still missed out. The 250 GTO is also thought to have gone to a British buyer.

The front engined rear-wheel drive sports car was capable of 165 mph in 1967 and produced 300bhp from its three-litre V12 engine able to hit 60mph in just 6.5 seconds
