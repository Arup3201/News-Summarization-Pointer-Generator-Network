Bradford will be hoping to cut down the opposition in the Kingstone Championship in 2015 with the aid of a player known as 'The Lumberjack'.

Australian front rower Karl Davies, 22, who has has spent this season with Queensland Super Cup team Mackay Cutters, has agreed a two-year deal with the relegated Bulls and becomes their eighth new face for next season.

'I believe I can bring a lot to Bradford and am very excited about coming over to ply my trade with the Bulls,' said the 6ft 3in, 17st forward. 'I am an explosive and aggressive type of player, with a strong work ethic.

'Next season will act as a fresh start for the club and I am looking forward to getting my teeth into the Championship before, hopefully, playing in Super League the year after.

'The squad being put together looks very strong, there are some fantastic names on board and we are going to take some stopping.'

Davies is due to arrive in the UK early next month, well in time for the start of pre-season training, and Bradford coach James Lowes is expecting his latest signing to become a fans' favourite.

'He is an explosive prop and he is someone I know will excite our supporters,' Lowes said.

'You need good, solid front-rowers in any leading side and Australia seems to deliver them. They know the job and do it well.

'He is a young and very talented individual and I like what I have seen of him.

'He is eager to get across and get started and I believe he has the potential to be a good player for us.'
