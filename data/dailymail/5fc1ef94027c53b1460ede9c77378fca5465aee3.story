Terrifying video footage shows the moment four badminton players narrowly escaped being crushed to death when the roof of a stadium collapsed mid-match.

Two singles matches were taking place in Ho Chi Minh City for the Vietnam Open when the roof caved in, raining down huge chunks of concrete on the court.

One spectator managed to film the dramatic moment a huge section of the ceiling caved in and spectators screamed and ran for cover.

Just seconds before the collapse, the referee had halted two simultaneous first-round singles matches taking place at the Phan Dinh Phung Sports Cente, when the roof started to move.

He managed to usher the four players off the courts just before the roof gave way.

Players and spectators at the £30,000 tournament in Ho Chi Minh City were left unharmed but shaken.

It has been confirmed the building was  earmarked for renovation.

The dramatic footage shows spectators dashing for cover as the ceiling fell, leaving a pile of debris and sending a plume of dust into the air.

'This stadium was too old, nearly 30 years old,' said Mai Ba Hung, deputy head of the city's Department of Culture, Sports and Tourism.

'It is awaiting major reconstruction, so safety checks may have been a bit loose,' Mr Hung said.

He said the tournament had been shifted to the city's Tan Binh Sports Center and an investigation into the ceiling collapse would take place. 

Organisers of badminton's Vietnam Open rushed to set up a new venue on Wednesday and resume play for the shuttlers who had a narrow escape from a ceiling collapse at an indoor stadium.
