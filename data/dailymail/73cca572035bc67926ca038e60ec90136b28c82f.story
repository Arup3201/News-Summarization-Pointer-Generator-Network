Ban: Justice Secretary Chris Grayling will stop officers from giving 'slap on the wrist' cautions to repeat offenders

Nearly 5,000 thugs, shoplifters and vandals have received multiple police cautions for similar offences within just two years, figures have revealed.

Ministry of Justice figures show that 4,763 adults received two or more cautions for identical or similar offences in the two years to March 31.

They included around 1,500 people who committed common assaults, 750 drugs offenders, 500 shoplifters and 700 people guilty of criminal damage.

But Justice Secretary Chris Grayling yesterday announced plans to ban officers from giving out the so-called ‘slaps on the wrist’ to repeat offenders.

Victims campaigners have long 
complained that police cautions are overused and allow too many 
criminals to escape formal justice.

A simple caution means that the 
offender receives no punishment, and a record of their offending is kept
only for a limited period of time. The only requirement is that they 
accept their guilt.

Ministers have already announced plans to abolish simple cautions for serious offences including rape and robbery.

Last night Mr Grayling said: ‘The 
current range of out of court disposals are confusing and the system is 
overly bureaucratic, that is why we are reviewing all out of court 
disposals.

'They should be consistent, straightforward and something in 
which victims and the wider public can have confidence.’

Ministry of Justice figures show a 
total of 4,763 adult criminals received two or more cautions for the 
same or similar offences in the two years to March 31 this year.

Changes to the law brought in next 
year will mean officers cannot give out a second caution for a similar 
offence within two years.

Only in exceptional circumstances will it be allowed - and must be signed off by an officer of Inspector rank.

Magistrates and victims groups will 
also be given new powers to inspect how forces give out cautions to make
sure they are not used excessively.

Soft touch no more: Police officers will be stopped from routinely giving offenders a second caution for similar offences within two years

The decision follow a major review of
cautioning conducted by the Ministry of Justice. Also under review are 
spot fines and cannabis warnings.

Earlier this year Mr Grayling warned 
spot fines had allowed gangs of yobs to commit crime and anti-social 
behaviour ‘regardless of the consequences’.

He said thugs even put aside cash to 
pay the penalty notices, then carry on offending, and claimed high 
streets have become ‘fair game’ for low level offenders who make life a 
misery for the public.

Lynne Owens, of the Association of 
Chief Police Officers, said: ‘It is in everyone’s interests that the 
justice system is as simple and clear to understand as possible.

'The current range of out of court disposals is too complicated and bureaucratic - we recommended and support its review.

‘It is important that there is room 
for officer discretion in any system to ensure the punishment is 
proportionate to the offence.

Criminal justice minister Damian 
Green said: ‘The current police guidance for dealing with crimes 
on-the-spot has evolved over time and is totally disjointed, no wonder 
we see a dramatic variation in their use.

‘That is why we are clamping down on 
the use of cautions and reviewing the whole spectrum of out of court 
disposals so we have clarity and consistency and most importantly we 
have a system that victims and the public have confidence in.’

The review of all out of court disposals is set to conclude in spring 2014.
