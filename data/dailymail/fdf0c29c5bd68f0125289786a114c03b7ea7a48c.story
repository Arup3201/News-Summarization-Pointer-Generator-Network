V8 Supercar driver Marcos Ambrose has said that his surprise return to Australian racing was motivated by wanting to raise his daughters in the place where he grew up.

Sacrificing his formidable $4 million a year NASCAR contract, Ambrose, 38, shocked racing enthusiasts when he appeared at Sydney Olympic Park to compete in the Sydney 500 on Friday.

The Tasmanian-born racer returned with his wife Sonja, and their daughters Tabitha, 8, and Adelaide, 6, after a nine-year slog in the US which saw him become a household name.

'I want them to grow up as Australians', Ambrose told Fox Sports.

'The timing was right for me personally to return to Australia for personal reasons — my family, my kids are six and eight,' Ambrose said.

'I want them to enjoy and experience Australian life, as well, so when they grow up they can make their own choices in life where they want to be.' 

The V8 driver left NASCAR unexpectedly, at the height of his success, having earned over $33 million as a winning member of the internationally recognised brand team.

Ambrose joined the just-formed Dick Johnson Race / Team Penske group, and has moved back to his hometown of Launceston in Tasmania from Charlotte in the US state of North Carolina.

Ambrose said in a statement that he was looking forward to racing in Australia again and having his family by his side, reported The Roar.

'The US and NASCAR have been very good to my family and me, but my goal has always been to give my daughters a chance to grow up with family and experience the home I love while they are still young. We are ready to take on this new venture.' 

He said that while he will have to make weekly trips to Brisbane to train with his team, the family will be based out of Tasmania, which he has always viewed as his home.

His daughters will have the chance to spend time with their cousins and other family who live in Tasmania, something Ambrose is keen for them to have the opportunity to do.

Holden driver Garth Tander said that Ambrose knew how difficult it would be to return and race against seasoned Australian drivers.

'It is a big ask to come and drive a race car here,' Tander told The Courier Mail.

'It is completely different to having a test at Queensland Raceway like he did. There is nothing like this place and the series is very competitive. It has changed a lot in the last nine years and this will be a big challenge for him,' he said.

'He is coming here this weekend to try and compete and it was always going to be tough and it will be tough. He won’t be winning races this weekend but he will get a lot out of the weekend.'
