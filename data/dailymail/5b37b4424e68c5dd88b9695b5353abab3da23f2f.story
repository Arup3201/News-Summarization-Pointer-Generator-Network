A new caviar is thought to be the most expensive food in the world with a kilo of the 'white gold' fetching an incredible £200,000 - that's a staggering £27,000 a teaspoon. 

The costly caviar is made from rare albino fish eggs and laced with 22-carat gold. 

The brand-new product will be served to royalty and the super rich at some of the best restaurants in the world from Monaco to Dubai. 

A kilo of the white gold  Strottarga Bianco caviar will fetch a whopping £200,000

The powdery caviar, called Strottarga Bianco, was invented by fish farmer Walter Gruell, 51, and his son Patrick, 25.

They say that the price is not just because of its exclusivity or its great taste, but also for its health advantages.  

The Austrian father and son duo said they decided to also include gold leaf as it was good for the immune system.

Patrick, from the central Austrian city of Salzburg, who along with his father is the first caviar producer in Austria, said: 'Our Strottarga Bianco comes from the white roe of the extremely rare albino sturgeon.'

The Persians were the first group of people to regularly consume the eggs of the sturgeon fish and they believed the Caspian delicacy enhanced the physical strength and endurance of those who ate it. 

Later, the Romans also attributed healing and medicinal properties to caviar. 

At present, and with the sturgeon in danger of extinction, white caviar has become a rare delicacy, exclusive and scarce, and now what is essentially the essence of white caviar is set to take it's place as the world's most exclusive food.

The albino beluga sturgeon that produces it originally lived in the Caspian Sea but is now almost extinct in its native environment, where the last surviving wild albino beluga sturgeon live in the unpolluted areas near Iran.

Although sturgeon fish usually live more than 100 years, very few of the albino variety reach that age, as the lack of melanin that makes them white is also a genetic disorder that limits their life.

It also explains why their eggs have become the most sophisticated and expensive food in the world.

He believes the extremely high standard of water in Austria flowing down from mountain snowfields helps to make sure the caviar produced in Austria is the best in the world as it has none of the pollution issues other countries have developed.

He added: 'It is part of the reason why it probably taste so good, that and the fact that it is specially seasoned before being dehydrated, when it loses 80 per cent of its weight.

'It is then grated extremely finely and mixed with 22-carat gold, which in very small amounts has a very positive effect on the human immune system.

'The golden yellow white spreadable powder that we create can quickly be made into a paste, risotto or put on toasted bread with butter. It only needs very small quantities for the flavour to be spread to a meal.

'The taste is very strong and taste distinctly of fresh fish.'

Regular white caviar sold by the father and son duo has been known to fetch a price of up to £40,000. 

Because the new Strottarga Bianco caviar uses five kilos of white caviar, which is then dehydrated to make one kilo of the gold mixture, it would cost at least £200,000 for the same amount. 

In order to give people a taste of what they have on offer, however, the producers are currently offering it at the discount price of £73,000 to selected customers. 

Patrick said: 'It is certainly not a product for everyone, but there is definitely a market for extremely exclusive products especially when they are something new.'

The Austrian father and son only use older sturgeon, because the eggs are more elegant, smooth, aromatic and better tasting with a spongier texture.
