The wife of a sports journalist who died in a car crash while covering the World Cup in Brazil only learned of her loss when a football boss sent her his condolences on Twitter.

After hearing of the death of Jorge 'El Topo' Lopez, Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone tweeted that he was 'not only a great journalist' but 'also a friend'.

But the Atletico boss was apparently unaware that Mr Lopez's wife, Veronica Brunati, had not heard of the tragedy. 'No. Diego, don't tell me that,' she responded. 'Please, someone call me.'

Simeone, who won the La Liga title with Atletico last season, tweeted: 'He was not only a great journalist, he was also a friend. Much pain. My condolences to @verobrunati and family. RIP Jorge 'Topo' Lopez.'

Ms Brunati, replying directly, first simply wrote 'no', before going on to say: 'Diego, don't tell me that. Please, someone call me. I'm in a hotel in San Pablo in the Quality.'

The day after Lopez's death, Ms Brunati changed her profile picture on Twitter to her and her husband.

Among those leading the tributes to Lopez was Lionel Messi who dedicated dedicated Argentina's win against the Netherlands last night to the reporter.

'Big hug to all the Argentina fans and a very special memory for Jorge 'Topo' Lopez,' wrote Messi, who was selected for random drug testing after they won 4-2 on penalties.

'This victory is especially for you, my friend. A big hug to the family, lots of strength.'
