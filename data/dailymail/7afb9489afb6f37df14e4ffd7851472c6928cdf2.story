Concerns that the Duke of Edinburgh might still be out of sorts after his bladder infection were quickly dispelled when he offered a characteristically dry retort to a reporter's question as he left hospital yesterday.

When asked if he was feeling better as he left the Edward VII Hospital in London, the Duke – who is 91 today – replied with the hint of a smile: 'Well I wouldn't be coming out if I wasn't!'

Prince Philip missed some of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee events because of his five-night hospital stay, and yesterday his granddaughter Princess Eugenie said his absence for the final two days of the Jubilee celebrations was keenly felt by the Queen.

Good news: Prince Philip smiled and waved as he headed home to be with his family at Windsor for a private celebration tomorrow

Walking tall: The Duke of Edinburgh looked in good spirits as he left hospital this morning

'Together, they are invincible. They are the most incredibly supportive couple to each other,' the 22-year-old said.

'For Granny to come and do that alone was probably quite testing and I think he is her rock, really, and she is his.'

Prince Philip is expected to attend a 
Diamond Jubilee garden party at Sandringham on Tuesday and accompany the
Queen on a two-day trip to the East Midlands on Wednesday.

The Prince's birthday will be 
celebrated by the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery when it fires a 
41-gun salute in his honour in Hyde Park, London, tomorrow but Philip is
not expected to attend.

A Buckingham Palace spokesman 
confirmed that Prince Philip was heading back to Windsor to spend his 
birthday celebrating privately with his family.

The spokesman said: 'He's out of hospital, his condition is improving and he will continue his convalescence at home.'

Heading home: The Duke of Edinburgh had not thought he would not be back at Windsor in time for his birthday after spending five nights at the hospital with a bladder infection

Yesterday, he was visited by grandsons Princes Harry and William, who was on leave from his RAF Search and Rescue duties.

Harry, meanwhile, has been spending the 
week since the Diamond Jubilee celebrations on pre-deployment training 
at Wattisham in Suffolk.

The Princes, dressed in jeans and 
V-neck jumpers, left the hospital after 20 minutes looking relaxed, and 
were whisked away in a silver Range Rover after their visit.

Philip had already been visited by 
the Queen, the Duke of York, the Earl and Countess of Wessex and their 
children, Louise and James.

Prince Andrew had said on Wednesday 
his father was 'mending very well', but the Palace had said he was not 
expected to be back at home in time to celebrate his birthday with the 
family.

Prince Edward had added that the Duke had
watched the thanksgiving service at St Paul’s on television. ‘He’s feeling a lot better, he just needs some rest,’ he said.

Philip is not due to attend his next 
scheduled engagement until Tuesday, when the Queen hosts a garden party 
at the Sandringham Estate to mark her Diamond Jubilee.

It is hoped her husband will be by her side at her Norfolk retreat if he is feeling strong enough.

It is also hoped he will be able to 
accompany her to the East Midlands on Wednesday for a two-day visit as 
part of the Queen's Jubilee tour of the UK.

Princess Eugenie has told how her grandmother the Queen would have found the final two days of the Diamond Jubilee 'quite testing' without Prince Philip by her side.

But the princess described her grandparents as a 'power couple who kind of astound people' as she gave the first interview by a royal following the Diamond Jubilee celebrations.

Eugenie, 22, told Sky News: 'To see Granny and Grandpa standing for four hours, I mean, together, they are invincible.

Optimistic: The pictures of Princes William and Harry smiling will give confidence to the nation that the Duke of Edinburgh is well on the way to recovery

'They are the most incredibly supportive couple to each other. Grandpa was unfortunately taken ill and for Granny to come and do that alone was probably quite testing and I think he is her rock really and she is his.'

Philip's admission to hospital meant he was forced to miss some of the Jubilee celebrations this week.

He spent Sunday braving the elements 
for the Thames River Pageant, which doctors suggested might have 
exacerbated his condition if he did not make enough visits to the 
toilet.

The Palace said earlier this week that he was being treated with antibiotics and was in good spirits.

The 
King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery is expected to fire a salute in 
London's Hyde Park to mark Philip's birthday, the Ministry of Defence 
said.

The
salute is fired every year to herald the occasion and the event is open
to the public but not customarily attended by members of the royal 
family.

Emotional time: The Queen found Philip in good form on Wednesday, leaving her in better spirits than she had seemed to be in at St Paul's Cathedral on Tuesday

The
illness forced the Duke to miss several key events of the Queen's 
Diamond Jubilee celebrations, including the service of thanksgiving at St 
Paul's Cathedral and the concert outside Buckingham Palace.

Edward said the Queen was ‘bearing up’ 
but added: ‘She’s missing him, obviously.’ Edward’s wife, Sophie, said 
the Duke was ‘naturally upset’ to miss the celebrations but added: ‘He’s
on good form. He is in good spirits.’

As the 
Queen left on Wednesday, she beamed with delight, seemingly hugely relieved at what she had seen.

Speaking yesterday, Prime Minister David Cameron said that everyone was concerned about the health of the Duke after he was 
taken to hospital with the infection.

Time well spent: The Queen spent approximately 50 minutes with her husband

Treatment: Prince Philip's bladder infection could have been exacerbated by not taking enough toilet breaks during the Diamond Jubilee River Pageant

Mr
Cameron said he was sure the Queen and the Duke would have gone ahead 
with Sunday’s river pageant in torrential rain regardless of the risks 
to their health after the day’s exertions - spending four hours on the 
water - were blamed for his turn of ill-health.

Speaking
to Sky News, Mr Cameron said: 'It was a most extraordinary spectacle 
and obviously everyone is very concerned and worried and wants to know 
that (the Duke) is going to be OK.

'The thing about our Royal Family is 
that they are incredibly dedicated to what they do and they are 
incredibly dedicated to doing it, no matter what the circumstances.

'I don’t know all the conversations 
that took place but I would be pretty certain that Her Majesty and the 
Duke of Edinburgh would have wanted to do what they did and would have 
carried on doing it.'

On Monday night the Queen was visibly 
moved as Prince Charles joked that the Duke of Edinburgh might hear the 
Jubilee concert from his bed if the crowd shouted loud enough.

All smiles: Sophie, The Countess of Wessex, is pictured leaving the hospital with her son James

In a warm, emotional and often witty 
speech in praise of his mother at the close of the Diamond Jubilee Concert, 
that appeared to make her lip quiver more than once, the
Prince of Wales said it was sad that the Duke of Edinburgh could not be
at the event after being taken unwell

While the Duke’s condition is not 
believed to be serious, doctors will not be taking any chances, given 
his advancing years, because bladder infections in the elderly can get 
worse very quickly if not treated promptly.

Questions are likely to be asked 
whether it was wise to allow the Duke, who had a stent inserted in his 
heart less than six months ago, to take part in Sunday’s Diamond Jubilee
Pageant, standing in the rain for four hours.

It is understood that staff at 
ambulance control in Berkshire received a call from Windsor Castle 
shortly after 2pm on Monday reporting that Prince Philip was feeling unwell.
