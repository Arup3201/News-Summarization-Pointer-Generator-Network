Eccentric online security expert John McAfee is claiming that 'civil libertarian hackers' are behind the cyber attack on Sony - not North Korea. 

The founder of cyber security firm McAfee says he knows who is part of the worldwide network of hackers who pulled off the attack - which crippled Sony's internal network, released troves of embarrassing and damaging information and threatened a September 11-style terrorist attack on theaters that aired the film 'The Interview.'

In an interview with The International Business Times, McAfee declined to name the people he says are behind the attack - saying he didn't want to 'nark' on them.

The FBI has blamed North Korea on the cyber attack on Sony Pictures. Government experts say that the hermit nation was furious about the Seth Rogen comedy for its depiction of the assassination of leader Kim Jong-un.

The 69-year-old McAfee told the IBT that the break-in was actually the work of hackers who 'hate the confinement, the restrictions the music industry and the movie industry has placed on art and so they are behind it.'

The hackers, McAfee said, saw Sony Pictures as a symbol of those restrictions for 'controlling the content of art.'

McAfee, who made his name and his fortune by building a cyber security firm to stop hackers, says he now finds himself sympathetic to their aims and an ally to their cause. 

McAfee, who resigned from his namesake company in 1994 and sold his shares, was named in 2012 by Belize authorities as a 'person of interest' in the murder of his neighbor in the Caribbean nation.

He escaped the country and is now living in America. According to reports his fortune, which was totaled more than $100million, has dwindled down to a few million dollars - possibly less. 

 McAfee says he doesn't mind that the US is blaming the North Koreans for the attack and targeting them as a result. 

'Maybe they have been wrongly accused in this case, but they have not been accused in cases where they should have been accused,' he said. 

McAfee isn't the first to cast doubt on the FBI's claims. Cyber intelligence firm Norse has released a report pointing at a disgruntled insider working with a group of outside hackers who released the information.
