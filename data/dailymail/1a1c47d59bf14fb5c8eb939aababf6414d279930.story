A teenage girl who died from an asthma attack after it was revealed that an ambulance was sent to the wrong address, 'could not have been saved' despite the ambulance service's failures, according to a coroner's report.

The East of England Ambulance Service (EEAS) has been told that it 'must learn from its mistakes', after the ambulance requested from RAF Brampton, in Cambridgeshire, following Elouise Keeling collapsing with breathing problems, was sent to RAF Wyton, 10 miles away.

The ambulance was called at 7.44pm, but because of the mistake, did not arrive until 8.03pm, and Elouise, 14, who had suffered from asthma since she was 18 months old, died at the scene as her mother Karen looked on.

An ambulance was immediately called at 7.44pm but was sent to RAF Wyton, 10 miles away, by mistake. The error meant it did not arrive until 8.03pm

Elouise, who had suffered from asthma since she was 18 months old, died at the scene. Her mother told an inquest she rushed to her daughter's side after she had called her saying she felt unwell

At the inquest at Huntingdon Law Courts, coroner David Morris said her death may not have been prevented even if the ambulance had arrived sooner.

However, he said: 'There is a lot that needs to be addressed by the ambulance service.

'There is good cause for those around her to feel aggrieved.

'The tragedy could not have been avoided by any more timely arrival but that doesn’t in anyway minimise the distress and concern on behalf of the family.

'I’m satisfied the ambulance service has been found wanting and has already taken many steps to address the issues raised.'

Elouise Keeling collapsed with breathing problems at RAF Brampton near Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire. An ambulance was immediately called at 7.44pm but was sent to RAF Wyton, 10 miles away, by mistake

Delays: Emergency services were called when Elouise had an asthma attack but paramedics did not reach her in time and she died 

Emergency care expert Dr John Heyworth, who complied a report on behalf of the EEAS, said that Elouise's prognosis had been 'grim' and it was unlikely she would have survived even if paramedics had gotten there earlier.

'There is no doubt earlier intervention would have increased the chances of a better outcome,' Dr Heyworth added.

'But by that point her chances of survival were low and if the ambulance had arrived a few minutes earlier, it would not have made a significant difference.'

Before her fatal asthma episode, Elouise had only managed to jog to a playing field and had not taken part in any activity when she suffered the attack.

Elouise Keeling, 14, collapsed with breathing problems during an Air Cadets sports day at RAF Brampton near Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, on June 25

She had seen a paediatrician about her worsening asthma earlier that day but was not considered an immediate risk, the inquest heard.

Pathologist Martin Goddard found she died of acute, severe asthma.

Dr Goddard said: 'This case is quite unusual.

'Her condition was very difficult to treat and potentially irreversible.

'Cases that are rapidly progressive in this way, tend to have a bad outcome.'

RAF Brampton was only four minutes by ambulance from Hinchingbrooke Hospital but, because she suffered a cardiac arrest, paramedics decided it was better to treat her at the scene.

The inquest earlier heard that ambulances had struggled to find RAF Brampton during incidents in 2006 and 2012 due to confusion over the postcode.

These problems were reported to the ambulance service and flagged on its system but this data was lost when the trust updated its systems, the inquest heard.

Solicitor Peter Collins, representing the Keeling family, read a statement on their behalf, saying that they hoped to set up a charity in Elouise's memory.

He said: 'The past two days have been an emotional and testing time for the family.

'Whilst some questions will inevitably remain unawanswerd, they have finally been provided with an account of events that led to the tragic loss of their daughter.

'They hope lessons will be learnt and perhaps other families will be spared the same heartache and devastation that they will always feel as a result of Elouise’s death.'

An EEAS spokesman said: 'We have met with Elouise’s family to explain what happened and apologise for the delay in getting an ambulance to her.

'Unfortunately we used a post code rather than a road name. Both RAF Wyton and RAF Brampton had the same postcode despite being some miles apart.

'This meant that we didn’t get an ambulance to Elouise until 15 minutes after the 999 call and despite the efforts of staff including an air ambulance doctor Elouise died.

Lost: Three-month-old Bella Hellings died when paramedics took 26 minutes to reach her after she had a fit and got lost again on the way to hospital

'A full internal investigation has led to a number of changes being made to the way we work to prevent such tragic incidents from happening again.

'This includes new processes for verifying addresses and flagging up concerns more quickly.'

The case of Elouise Lessing adds to the mounting criticism against the EEAS regarding delays.

Recently, crews were described as 'chaotic' after another coroner heard that three-month-old Bella Hastings had died when paramedics took three times longer than national targets dictate to reach her home in Thetford, Norfolk.

Darren Maguire, general manager at EEAS, told the inquest steps had to be taken to improve procedures following the coroner's judgement on Elouise's death.

He said: 'We are moving to improve the level of service that we provide.'
