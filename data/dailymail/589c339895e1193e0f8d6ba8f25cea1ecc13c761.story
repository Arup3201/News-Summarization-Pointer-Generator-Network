Once the preserve of elderly relatives, it seems that sherry has shaken off its staid reputation

Once the preserve of elderly relatives, it seems that sherry has shaken off its staid reputation and has become trendy among the young.

But rather than the brown, sticky syrup imbibed by granny at Christmas (for medicinal purposes, of course) demand is being driven by a thirst for pale, dry varieties.

Marks & Spencers has announced that sherry sales are already up by a third on last year, ahead of the festive season.  

According to the Times, among the biggest sellers is PX - a premium aged style, which has seen sales up 180 per cent on last year.  

Sherry is a fortified wine made from white grapes that are grown near the town of Jerez de la Frontera in Spain, and it has been imported by Britain since the 15th century.

Since 2010, specialist sherry bars have been opening around the country, with 35 alone in London in the past three years.

And the number of importers selling sherry in the UK has doubled since 2006, according to Graham Hines - director of the Sherry Institute.

He told the Times: '[Sherry] is an old friend which is being seen in a new light.

'It used to be served in a measly, little Elgin glass, always warm, always up at the back of the bar, under the lights... Now it is being served properly, in decent glasses, at the right temperature.'

In its home country, sherry is named vino de Jerez. The English term 'sherry' comes simply from an anglicisation of the word Jerez.

After fermentation of the wine is complete, sherry is fortified with brandy.

Because the fortification takes place after fermentation, most sherries are initially dry, with any sweetness being added later (in contrast to port wine, for example, which is fortified halfway through its fermentation, which stops the process so that not all of the sugar is turned into alcohol).

Marks & Spencer has announced that sherry sales are already up by a third on last year

Sherry is produced in a variety of styles, ranging from dry, light versions such as finos to darker and heavier versions known as olorosos, all made from the Palomino grape.

Sherry is a protected designation of origin product in Europe - like Champagne - meaning all wine labelled as 'sherry' must legally come from the Sherry Triangle, which is an area in the province of Cádiz between Jerez de la Frontera, Sanlúcar de Barrameda, and El Puerto de Santa María.In 1933 the Jerez Denominación de Origen was the first Spanish denominación to be officially recognised in this way.
