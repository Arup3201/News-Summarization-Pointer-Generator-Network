England's Oliver Wilson will take a three-shot lead into the final round of the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship, but world number one Rory McIlroy is one of the Englishman's nearest challengers.

Wilson, who has finished runner-up nine times on the European Tour but lost his card in 2012, carded a third round of 65 at St Andrews to finish 15 under par.

But on a day of low scoring following a one-hour delay due to heavy overnight rain, McIlroy shot a 64 and Tommy Fleetwood a 62 on the Old Course to finish 12 under alongside French duo Alexander Levy (68) and Raphael Jacquelin (69).

He has a three-shot lead of the chasing pack going into the final day on Sunday

Wilson is ranked 792nd in the world and a lowly 102nd on the Challenge Tour rankings, but a win on Sunday would be worth almost £500,000 and a two-year exemption on the European Tour.

'I'll be nervous,' admitted Wilson, who played on the 2008 Ryder Cup team. 'It's a big day for me. Last year I got off to a great start here and kind of fizzled out.

'But the way I played the last two days, I left so many putts out there and I'm still at the top. So that gives me a lot of belief, but tomorrow will be a very different day. But that's what we play golf for, to get in those situations and test yourself. I am looking forward to it.

'I've had the belief for a while, I've just needed a little bit of adrenaline to be honest. I've been flat all year for various reasons and to get the opportunity to come here and play is very nice and I guess I come to a tournament like this with a bit more dynamism.'

McIlroy found himself nine shots off the lead after struggling to an opening 73 at Carnoustie, one of the three courses used for the pro-am event.

But the four-time major winner bounced back with a 67 at Kingsbarns on Friday and carried on where he left off at St Andrews, a course he "hated" on his debut in 2005 but which is now a favourite and the place where he will defend the Open Championship next July.

He birdied five holes in a row from the third and also picked up a shot on the ninth to be out in 30 and move into the lead.

That lead did not last long as Wilson chipped in for an eagle on the fifth and also birdied the sixth, but McIlroy responded with birdies on the 11th, 12th and 14th before dropping his only shot of the day on the 16th, where he needed two attempts to play out sideways from a fairway bunker.

The Ryder Cup hero is three behind after shooting eight under on Saturday

'I got off to a really fast start and was trying to keep it going, and I sort of did through the turn, but the last four holes weren't really what I wanted,' said McIlroy, who has finished second twice, third and eighth in five appearances in this event.

'But any time you shoot a score like that around St Andrews, you have to be happy. I got myself into contention going into tomorrow and my dad (his amateur partner) and I are going to get to play St Andrews on his 55th birthday tomorrow which will be a huge treat for both of us.

'Shooting a 59 never really crossed my mind. What did cross my mind was wanting to beat my previous best score round here of 63 (in the first round of the 2010 Open).'
