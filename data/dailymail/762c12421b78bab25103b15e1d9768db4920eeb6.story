Rickie Fowler made a flying start to Ryder Cup week as the United States team made their way to Scotland.

Fowler, who will play in the showdown against Europe for the second time after starring at Celtic Manor four years ago, posted pictures on Twitter ahead of the clash at Gleneagles.

The 25-year-old posed behind the controls of the plane and also showed off his new haircut, with 'USA' shaved into the side of his head.

The Americans arrived at Edinburgh Airport on Monday morning with Tom Watson giving waiting photographers a thumbs-up as he stepped off the plane.

Watson later gave his thoughts on Fowler's haircut as he sat alongside European counterpart Paul McGinley at the captains' press conference at Gleneagles.

Asked what he thought of Fowler's haircut, Watson said: 'I thought it was great, terrific. It brings a light spirit to the team and I would not be surprised if Ted Bishop (PGA of America president) puts USA in his hair if it means we are going to win.'

McGinley agreed, adding: 'As Tom said I think that's great. I think it's brilliant the guy is so passionate about his country he will go and do that for the Ryder Cup.'

Europe are favourites to keep hold of the trophy but world No 1 Rory McIlroy is taking nothing for granted.

McIlroy, who arrived at Gleneagles on Sunday, claimed Fowler could be America's talisman.

'Rickie Fowler - he could be a real talisman for the American team,' McIlroy told Goals on Sunday. 'Bubba Watson, Keegan Bradley, Phil (Mickleson) as well.

'Everyone's been talking about Europe being favourites but the Americans have still got a very strong team. We can't be complacent at all.'
