Judge Lindsey Kushner QC said Costel lent his nation a bad name at Manchester Crown Court

A judge has slammed a Romanian thief who stole 27 smartphones worth £9,000 from Limp Bizkit fans at a gig in Manchester gig telling him: 'We do not want criminals such as yourself in this country.'

Police raided Stefu Costel's flat in Chorlton, Manchester, and found 27 handsets stuffed inside a plastic carrier bag. 

All of them had been stolen from fans in the crowd during the gig by the American nu metal band at The Academy venue on Oxford Road in Manchester in February, Manchester Crown Court was told.

Costel, 
30, orginally from Romania, claimed he was given the bag to look after 
by his brother's friend but was jailed for 14 months after he pleaded 
guilty to handling stolen goods.

Judge Lindsey Kushner QC said Costel was part of what amounted to an 'absolute plague' in the UK.

She said: 'It lends his nation a bad name. Everybody gets tarred with the same brush.

'He is one of those people in one of those gangs who go to public events and sweep through everyone.  

'These are offences that are a plague on all of us.

'It is not just a bit of pick-pocketing. It is a rash. It is a gang stealing, and you are part of that arrangement.

'We do not want criminals such as yourself in this country.'

The career criminal had a previous conviction for conspiring to steal from bank customers in a debit and credit card scam. 

Costel, who was living in Railway Terrace in Chorlton at the time, was also jailed last year for stealing mobile phones from music fans at ReadingFestival.

Tim Greenald, prosecuting, told the court that Limp Bizkit fans in Manchester were unaware they had been targeted during the gig. 

He said the majority of fans hit were men who had smartphones swiped from their pockets. 

Handsets were a mixture of iPhones, Samsung Galaxy phones, HTC phones and Sony Xperia phones.

All will now be returned.

Mr Greenald said: 'They were not aware of the thefts when they took place but realised that they had become victims during the night. 

'It was an organised and planned theft most likely committed by more than one person with a degree of skill used.

'He denied knowledge there were mobile phones in the bag and said he did not benefit financially.'

The police raid at his home came just two days after the thefts at the gig.

Nicola Gatto, defending, said Costel had an 'acute psychotic disorder' and wanted to return to Romania.
