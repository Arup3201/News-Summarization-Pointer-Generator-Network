A mother has lost parts of both of her legs after she saved the lives of her two children by laying on top of them as a deadly tornado swept through their home.

Stephanie Decker, 36, lost one leg above the knee and the other above the ankle, yet her son and daughter escaped without a single scratch after the tornado flattened their Henryville, Indiana home.

Henryville was nearly entirely flattened by a series of tornadoes that ravaged the South and Midwest on Friday, killing 39 and leaving thousands homeless.

But while the Decker family lost their 'dream home' to the severe weather, they are celebrating their safety. Mrs Decker is now in a stable condition at University Hospital in Louisville, her husband said.

'What I told her was: "You’re alive and you get to see your kids grow up,"' Joe Decker told the Louisville Courier Journal, adding: 'There's no way anybody should've lived.'

Decker told the paper that he had texted his wife from his workplace to tell her a tornado was heading for their three-story home.

She rushed their eight-year-old son Dominic and five-year-old daughter Reese into the basement, where she lay across them to protect them from the storm.

Speaking to the Courier Journal 
outside his destroyed home, Mr Decker said his wife, who is using a 
ventilator tube, typed out what had happened by using an iPad in the 
hospital.

She said she saw part of the house collapse on her and pulled her daughter out of the way.

'She doesn’t remember anything after that,' Mr Decker said.

Dominic then alerted the neighbours who came to find Mrs Decker, even though many of their homes had been crushed to the ground.

One neighbour, Brian Lovins, a Clark 
County Sheriff’s officer, used a tourniquet to stop severe bleeding and 
drove her until he could flag down an ambulance, which took her to 
hospital.

The home, which was partly built by Mr 
Decker and his wife's father, is now completely destroyed, with a 
bathtub 200 feet away in a nearby field, the Courier Journal reported.

The house 'took about nine months to build and about four seconds' to fall, Mr Decker added.

Destruction: The Decker family home was just one of the hundreds 
destroyed by tornadoes in Indiana. Damage can be seen in nearby Marysville which was 
entirely wiped off the map by the severe weather

Writing on Facebook on Sunday night, Mr Decker said the ventilator has been removed and his wife is now breathing on her own and will undergo further surgery this week.

Physicians Ancillary Services, where Stephanie has worked for three years, released a statement, the Frankfort Journal reported.

CEO Carl J. Tyler praised the Deckers 
who 'lost everything' and said that the company has set up a trust fund,
The Stephanie Decker Recovery Fund, to help pay their medical bills and
the losses they suffered.

He added: 'I can tell you they are 
some of the hardest working, giving people you could ever want to meet. 
They would never ask for help, but would be there to give it to others 
in a second.'

Snow fell across parts of Indiana on Sunday night, adding insult to injury and stunting rescue efforts.

Hundreds of homes, businesses, schools and vehicles across the country have been destroyed by the spate of tornadoes last week.

Total deaths 39

Alabama 1

Georgia 1

Indiana 13

Kentucky 21

Ohio 3

The storms on Friday claimed lives in Alabama, Georgia. Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio, with Indiana and Kentucky particularly hit, with 13 and 21 lives lost respectively.

Additional fatalities may result as cleanup crews clear rubble from more than 85 twisters across 10 states.

Hundreds of others were injured in the biggest one-day burst of 
tornadoes in March in U.S. Weather Service history.

They included a 14-month-old girl from New Pekin, Indiana, who was found alive 10 miles from her 
home in a farm field - yet tragically, the tot, Angel Babcock, succumbed to her injuries.

Her parents and two siblings - a two-year-old brother and younger sister - also died in the storms and were buried in a snow-covered cemetery in Salem, Indiana.

Mourning: Friends and family gather for the funeral of the Brough family at Crown Hill Cemetery in Salem, Indiana, today. Angel Babcock, who was found in a field but died after being taken off life support, was buried with her family

But the Decker's story is not the 
only one of amazing survival. One seven-year-old boy survived being 
snatched from his bed by a tornado and thrown 350ft on an embankment of a
highway.

Jamal Stevens miraculously only suffered minor injuries on Friday from the twister that demolished his family's two-story home in Charlotte, North Carolina.

His grandmother Patricia said: 'I've never seen or heard anything like that.' She said it 'sucked out the walls' of the house in the darkness.

Henryville and nearby Marysville suffered extreme and widespread damage, with roofs ripped from schools, trees uprooted from 
the ground, and vehicles overturned and dented by baseball-sized hail.

Utility
crews are now working to eliminate the danger posed by downed 
electrical lines and leaking natural gas lines, making it safer for 
non-trained volunteers to work in those communities.

Thousands
of homes and businesses in Kentucky, Indiana, Tennessee and Ohio were 
without power and water service in the aftermath.

The
tornadoes were the second round of twisters to strike the nation, after
13 people were killed last Tuesday in a series of tornadoes that struck
Kansas, Missouri and Illinois.

Government
officials said property damage would run into the millions. Affected 
regions were declared federal disaster areas, making them eligible for 
recovery grants, CNHI reported.
