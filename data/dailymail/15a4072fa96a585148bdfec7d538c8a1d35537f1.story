Drinking three pints of beer – or three medium-sized glasses of wine – once a week permanently dulls the brain, according to a study.

Researchers discovered that regular drinkers have to use almost 20 per cent more brain-power than normal to carry out simple tasks and find it progressively more difficult to concentrate.

The three-year study at the University of Santiago de Compostela in Spain compared 26 ‘binge-drinking’ students – those who regularly drank a minimum of six units of alcohol, or around three pints, in one sitting at least once a week – with 31 others who did not regularly drink as much.

Later, when sober, the students were asked to react to different flashing symbols.

There was no measurable difference in speed or accuracy of response between the two groups, and no deterioration over time.

However, brain-power measurements showed that ‘binge-drinkers’ had to  work harder to achieve the same result.

Risks: Drinking beer regularly permanently dulls brain function

With the more sober group, peak brain 
activity stayed  at about 18 microvolts while the drinkers started at 20
 microvolts in their first year and went up to 22 microvolts in their 
third year.

It suggests that young drinkers ‘experience anomalies in neural activity’ involved with attention and working memory, the researchers wrote in the journal Alcohol and Alcoholism.

Emily Robinson, director of the campaign group Alcohol Concern, said: ‘This shows why we need to change the culture where it’s seen as the norm to drink excessively  at university.

Risk: Too many alcoholic drinks can affect concentration as well as organ function

‘Binge-drinking carries lots of risks in terms of the immediate safety of students, but also in terms of their future health and the likelihood of developing an alcohol problem later in life.’

But Paul McCormack, of Oxford Brookes University Students’ Union, said: ‘Learning at university is not limited to the classroom.

'While having a few drinks on a regular basis may dull your senses slightly, the gains far outweigh the disadvantages.’
