The Beatles were Christmas Number One and David Cameron had not even been born when midwife Carol Chadwick started working for the NHS.

Fifty years on, the 67-year-old grandmother is about to retire from Tameside Hospital.

Mrs Chadwick, from Dukinfield, Tameside, said: ‘It's lovely bringing babies into the world, seeing new life and seeing new mums through difficult times, but I've decided it's time to retire.

‘I've seen so many changes. At one time we didn't have the dads at deliveries. I think things now are more informal - the uniforms certainly are!’

Ms Chadwick, who has a four-year-old granddaughter, began her career with the NHS at 17 as a pre-nursing student at Macclesfield Hospital.

She returned to her home patch in 1966 to spend two years at Ashton General Hospital before heading to Liverpool Women's Hospital to train as a midwife.

In her first few years on the job, Ms Chadwick’s patch included the city's tough Scotland Road area which was home to families whose fortunes depended on the nearby docks.

She then spent the 1970s as a nurse and midwife in Merseyside and Cheshire before returning to Tameside in 1981.

Mrs Chadwick (pictured with her husband, Jeff, and their children in 1987) says that when she first became a midwife men did not enter the delivery room

Ms Chadwick, who is now a midwifery sister in the maternity unit's operating theatres, said: ‘I couldn't tell you how many babies I've delivered, but it must be thousands. 

‘My daughter is 29, so I'm now at the stage where I'm delivering her friends' babies and that's really lovely.’

Ms Chadwick says she had always wanted to be a nurse and after finishing school aged 15 she went to technical college to get the qualifications she'd need to train as a nurse.

She said: ‘So many things have changed while I’ve been working - most of them good.

‘People now are fitter than they were in the 1960s, and we have better diets.

‘Now we get many older mums, women in their 40s just starting their families but many of them are fitter and healthier than women in their 20s were 40 years ago.

‘Another thing is that years ago people used to die from things that now they don't.

Mrs Chadwick (left graduating in 1968 and, right, as a young nurse in 1971) says that the uniforms nurses and midwives wear have become much less formal during her long career in the NHS

‘And our attitude to patients has changed too - when I first started nursing if someone had cancer they almost certainly would die, but we wouldn't tell them.

‘The attitude was that you couldn't do a lot for a lot of people and you didn't tell them they were dying.

‘Then, at some point along the line, it was decided that it really wasn't our place to keep it from them.

‘I haven't watched Call The Midwife, but I think my time in Liverpool was a bit like that.

‘We would get lots of ladies who weren't very well nourished having lots of babies and that could lead to problems.

‘But even now at Tameside hospital there are ladies coming in having their eighth, ninth, even tenth baby.’

Mrs Chadwick says that while she has been in the NHS people's health and diets have improved. Image shows her class graduating at Ashton Hospital in 1968

She added: ‘Now, people want to go home sooner too. If there's not been any complications the ladies go home the same day or the day after they've given birth.

‘One time they were encouraged to be in bed for days - now that's the last thing we want people to do.

‘I've only been working two days a week for a bit and now I've decided it's time to go and I've handed my notice in.’

Mrs Chadwick says she hopes to spend her retirement enjoying time with her granddaughter and cycling in the countryside with her husband.

Karen James, Tameside Hospital’s Interim Chief Executive, paid tribute to Mrs Chadwick’s service.

She said: ‘Carol’s service to the NHS and Tameside Hospital has been outstanding and is to be applauded.

‘Her care, commitment and passion serve as a benchmark for all our staff and, while she will be sadly missed, we wish Carol the very best in retirement and thank her for her wonderful years of dedication.’
