Google is to launch an online store for Android tablets to help the machines take on Apple's iPad.

The store will sell tablets such as Samsung's Galaxy Tab 10.1 - but will also feature Google-branded machines made in partnership with companies such as Asus.

Google is also to manufacture its own tablets, due to its pending purchase of Motorola, which is awaiting approval in China.

Google may also partner with Samsung to make tablets.

Google already offers similar Google-branded smartphones, made in collaboration with Samsung.

The report in the Wall Street Journal quoted unnamed sources familiar with the matter.

There is no set release date for the new tablet store.

Google has already tried selling direct to consumers with an earlier version of its own-branded 'Nexus' handsets, made by HTC, but the effort was not a success.

Google recently rebranded its Android
Marketplace as Google Play, streamlining services such as its video 
store, ebook store and app marketplace, so the timing would make sense.

Leaks
from hi-tech suppliers in the Far East had already hinted that a small,
cheap Android 'entertainment tablet' might be released in the first 
half of this year.

The tablet could sell for as little as Â£130, and will have a seven-inch screen, according to a leak reported in Digitimes.

Asus's hit EEEPad - the tablet maker is said to be developing a seven-inch tablet in collaboration with Google which would carry both Asus and Google branding

The
device would be a competitor to Amazon's Kindle Fire - and like Fire, 
would be built to sell content such as video and music via Google's own 
online store.

In
an interview with Italian newspaper Corriere della Serra, Google 
executive chairman Eric Schmidt reportedly said last year, 'In the next six 
months, we plan to market a tablet of the highest quality.'
