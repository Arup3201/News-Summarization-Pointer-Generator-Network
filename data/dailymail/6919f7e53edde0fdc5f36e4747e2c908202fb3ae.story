They may be old classics, but these books have been left completely timeless.

American Artist Alexis Arnold has grown crystals on classic books including 'Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea', 'Phantom Tollbooth', and 'The Singing Tree'.

The 30-year-old, from San Francisco, uses laundry detergent to create the crystals which appear after the books are soaked in hot water and left to dry.

Sparkling: The artist, from San Francisco, uses laundry detergent to create the crystals which appear after the books are soaked in hot water and left to dry. This shows the book Encyclopedia of Superstitions

Her work has become so popular university libraries exhibit the books and they sell for around £320.

Ms Arnold said: 'When selecting objects to crystallise, I was mostly concerned with objects that had lost their function or place, and printed books were fitting into this category more and more.

'I decided to start crystallising books and the following day came across eight boxes of wonderful, old books on the side of the road.

'I primarily use the laundry detergent, Twenty Mule Team Borax, to grow crystals on the various objects, but there are many household products that can be used to grow different types of crystals.

Crystallised: The work has become extremely popular, with university libraries exhibiting the books and they sell for about £320. This book is the Alchemists Handbook

Stunning: Ms Arnold said the reaction to her work varies but often the growth of the crystals symbolises growth through childhood as many of the works are children's fiction. This book is called This Is Water

'I start by creating a super-saturated solution of Borax in boiling water. When water boils, its molecules expand.

'I submerge the book in the hot, saturated solution and carefully manipulate the book to my liking. As the saturated water cools again, the molecules shrink and any excess Borax crystallises.

'Once the solution has completely cooled and the crystals have grown on the submerged objects, I drain the solution and dry the object without disturbing its shape.

'The objects will hold their new, transformed shape when completely dry.'

Gleaming: Ms Arnold said that when she is selecting things to crystallise, she is mostly concerned with objects that had lost their function or place.

Talented: This cactus was also crystallised by the artist

Ms Arnold says the crystals  change from translucent to opaque over time depending on atmospheric conditions.

She said the reaction to her work varies but often the growth of the crystals symbolises growth through childhood as many of the works are children's fiction.

She said: 'I love hearing people's response to my work and the interpretations vary, along with which books people prefer.

Unique: Ms Arnold says the crystals remove the text and transform the books into aesthetic, non-functional objects which leave the stories to remain as memories. This is the book Chemistry - An Experimental Science

Original: Ms Arnold says much of her artwork represents visual displays of time, memory, and history. This shows The Singing Tree

'It may be due to the books I have chosen or an association of crystal growth and youth, but many people tell me the work evokes memories from their childhood.

'The crystals remove the text and transform the books into aesthetic, non-functional objects, leaving the stories to remain as memories.

'The books, now frozen with heavy crystal growth, have become artefacts or geologic specimens imbued with the history of time, use, and nostalgia.

'Much of my artwork seeks to represent the visual displays of time, memory, and history.'
