Roger Federer moved on to 999 tour-level victories as he beat Grigor Dimitrov 6-2 6-2 in the semi-finals of the Brisbane International on Saturday.

The world number two will face Milos Raonic in Sunday's final, with the opportunity to join Jimmy Connors and Ivan Lendl as the only players to reach four figures in the Open Era.

Federer, the top seed, needed only 53 minutes to see off number four Dimitrov, winning 75 percent of his service points and breaking the Bulgarian four times.

Having finished runner-up to Lleyton Hewitt in this tournament last year, Federer is hoping to go one better in order to seal his 83rd tour-level title.

To do so, he will need to beat third-seeded Raonic, who overcame number two Kei Nishikori in a two-and-a-half battle that finished 6-7 (4), 7-6 (4), 7-6 (4).

Federer will play his 125th professional final against Raonic with a seven to one head to head in his favour ahead of the first Grand Slam of the season in Melbourne which starts on January 19.

World No 11 Grigor Dimitrov had no answer to Federer in Brisbane on Saturday during the straight sets loss

The 17-time Grand Slam champion came into the 2015 season with 996 wins and has had three more on the way to Sunday's final, where he'll meet third-seeded Milos Raonic. He has a 7-1 win-loss record against the 24-year-old Canadian, who served 34 aces to grind out a 6-7 (4), 7-6 (4), 7-6 (4) win over second-seeded Kei Nishikori in the other semi-final.

'It's a goal for the season, so I still have time to get to a thousand,' Federer said, smiling. 'I mean, it's a really big number, no doubt about it. Love to get it tomorrow, especially in the finals in an ATP event where most of my wins have come.

'If not tomorrow, I hope it happens at the Australian Open. It would definitely be an incredible milestone to reach.'

Only Jimmy Connors and Ivan Lendl have won more than 1,000 matches.
