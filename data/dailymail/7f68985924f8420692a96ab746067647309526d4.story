In a emotional 15th birthday message to her daughter Abigail, Zenya Hernandez begged for the schoolgirl to come home

The mother of a 15-year-old New Hampshire girl who vanished last month on her way home from school has written a letter pleading for the teen’s return.

'I miss you and love you more than you can imagine,' Zenya Hernandez said in her note written on a yellow legal pad and dated November 22.  'I feel your absence every day. You belong home with me.'

Abigail Hernandez was last seen October 9, after leaving Kennett High School. Police say she walked her normal route toward home and sent several texts between 2.30 and 3pm. She never made it home.

In her letter, the missing girl’s mother said she believed Abby was alive, and she expressed hoped that her daughter would find a way to reach out to her.

‘Abby, you are a strong young woman and I am staying strong for you,’ Zenya Hernandez wrote. ‘You are courageous, you are smart, and you are beautiful.’

New Hampshire Assistant Attorney General Jane Young said investigators are still working the case and that it is important to keep Abby's picture in the media -- especially outside of the local area.

‘Abby, I keep having a dream where you come home and I give you the biggest hug ever,’ she wrote in her letter. ‘I know in my heart this dream means something and that it matters. I pray to God it will come true.’

The letter was signed, ' Love, Mom,' with a little heart drawn on the page. 

During a press conference held this afternoon in front of the Conway Police Department, Miss Hernandez addressed her daughter, saying she believed Abby was out there somewhere watching her right now.

State and Conway police and the FBI have been inundated with hundreds of tips. The FBI is offering a $20,000 reward for information leading to a conviction in the case, Boston.com reported.

The last call made on a missing New Hampshire girl’s cellphone was October 9 about four hours after she was last seen, investigators said.

Abigail, a Kennett High School student, has been missing since Wednesday last week after walking home from class.

All-American girl: Abby ran track at school and was described as quiet and bright

The last sighting of the girl, who ran on
the track team for her school and was described as quiet and bright, 
was around 2.30pm.

Investigators believe Abigail made it back to her home, but when her mother came back from her nursing job, her daughter was gone.

The schoolgirl's 15th birthday was on October 12.

Police said they have not located the 
girl’s phone, but have determined that the last call was made at 6.30pm -
about four hours after her last sighting.

It was used about two miles from her home at a spot near Cranmore Mountain - a popular local ski resort.

Since then local police and the FBI 
have searched on foot, in boats, and by helicopter but have failed to 
turn up any new evidence about the disappearance.

FBI fixed-wing planes have been 
drafted into the search, and on Saturday lines of officials meticulously
searched four square miles of woodland.

Despite
searching over 3,000 acres Major Kevin Jordan of the Maine Fish and 
Game Department, said: 'We are nowhere near done. We are here to find 
Abi and to bring her home.'

Five specially trained teams of sniffer dogs were also used, but so far to no avail.

The search has been so thorough that officers have found the body of a hiker who went missing last month, and bone fragments from another case, possibly that of a hiker who went missing in 2006.

Both sets of evidence are unrelated to the Hernandez case.

New Hampshire's White Mountains are full of tourists at this time of year as they come to take pictures of the leaves changing in autumn.

Police, FBI, New Hampshire Fish and Game personnel and volunteers have all helped to search for the teenager but have not found any leads

The travelers were handed flyers of the pretty brunette girl and told to watch for anything suspicious.

Hernandez's picture was also plastered over store windows in North Conway Village and in the popular shopping mall.

Police officials said they are still treating Hernandez's disappearance as a missing persons case, but added that foul play has not been ruled out.

Abigail is 5ft 4in tall and weighs 118lb with
brown hair and eyes. She was last seen wearing black stretch pants, 
tall brown boots and a grey sweater.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Conway police on 603-356-5715.
