An ex-husband has appeared in court charged with stealing his former wife’s beloved cat Marmalade just weeks after they split up.

Jonathan Brewster, 45, who left the marital home in Maidstone, Kent, when the couple separated, is accused of ‘catnapping’ the 13-year-old pet in July.

His wife Tracy, 52, has devoted her life to finding the animal in recent months and has even lost her job as a housekeeper after investing so much time orchestrating a major community search.

Marmalade the cat has been missing from Maidstone, Kent, since July and has not been seen for three months 

She has also been having sleepless nights without her pet, which has not been seen since it disappeared three months ago.

Mr Brewster, who now lives in Braintree, Essex, has been charged with theft and is accused of stealing the cat between July 13 and July 20.

The mechanical engineer, who has received death threats over the alleged catnapping, has denied taking and subsequently ‘dumping’ the ginger cat.

During an appearance at Maidstone Magistrate’s Court this week, Brewster was released on bail ahead of a trial in January.

Shortly after Marmalade’s disappearance, Mrs Brewster set up Facebook and Twitter pages which drew online support from thousands of people.

Along with friends, she raised a reward of £1,300 and mobilised huge groups of volunteers to take to the streets of Maidstone to raise awareness of the cat’s disappearance.

Armed with thousands of posters, she commandeered legions of helpers known as the ‘Marmie Army’ to scour her hometown wearing T-shirts emblazoned with the cat’s face.

But the hunt for the prized feline has so far been unsuccessful.

Last night, before going away, she wrote to the 2,317 people that have joined her Facebook page: ‘Look out for Marmie while gone. Got to get my baby home.’

She also urged those who have supported her search efforts not to mention her husband’s name. 

Mrs Brewster said she 'totally and utterly adores' Marmalade and has raised a £1,300 reward for his return

Following the court appearance on Monday, she posted a statement which said: ‘Please please do not comment on the person in question - we just need to carry on trying to find Marmie and I need you all with me.’

The cat, which is micro-chipped, is described as a ‘beautiful, long-haired, light ginger neutered male cat’ on the Facebook page.

Mrs Brewster also described the cat, which she claims has never left her garden, as having a ‘freckled right eye and bald lower belly’.

She added: ‘He is totally and utterly adored by his mum who is desperate and devastated without him.’
