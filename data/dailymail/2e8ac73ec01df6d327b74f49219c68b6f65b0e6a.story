Jason Alexander has been jailed for spending thousands on electronic goods on his company's credit card

A 'Robin Hood' fraudster has been jailed after using his company credit card to buy £90,000 of electronic gadgets to sell to colleagues at bargain prices. 

Jason Alexander used his manufacturing company's accounts to buy iPads, phones and computer equipment before selling them on to workmates. 

The 39-year-old from Pontypool, South Wales, has been jailed for two years after details of his 'philanthropic' scam emerged.

The city's Crown Court heard how Alexander, the purchasing manager Northern Automotive Systems in Gilwern near Abergavenny, spent as much as £5,000 on some items which he then gave colleagues for  £180.

Buying gadgets on Amazon, eBay and Argos, he racked up a £90,956 bill on the company credit card - spending £10,000 more a month than in previous years.  

Among other charges made to the company, for which he had worked for 14 years, was petrol for his Land Rover and Mini and tickets to a Nicki Minaj concert. 

His deceit was revealed when the company asked employees if any of them had bought cut priced electrical goods.  

Sentencing Judge Stephen Hopkins QC described the scheme as 'philanthropic'. 

'It seems you were doing it as some kind of philanthropic act.

'In some cases spending £5,000 on items and then selling the items to employees for as little as £180 on the philanthropic basis they will not have been able to buy the items themselves.' 

'The impact upon your colleagues has been awful. You have stolen from the company and there was a dip in morale for a period. 

'You had an enormous impact on a large number of perfectly innocent people. Those to whom you sold goods now feel stupid and stressed. 

'This was a gross and serious breach of trust over a substantial period of years.'

An April hearing will determine if Alexander will be forced to repay any of the money used in fraudulent transactions.

Alexander was sentenced to two years in jail at Cardiff Crown Court (above) where a judge described the scheme as a 'sort of philanthropic act'
