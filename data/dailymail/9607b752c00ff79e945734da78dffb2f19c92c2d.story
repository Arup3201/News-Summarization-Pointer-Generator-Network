It was not as if England lost to Bangladesh in the sub-continent. These were English-type conditions and it was seamers who took the wickets, not spinners. That makes it even more of a diabolical result.

Players always have to take responsibility and have a good look at themselves but mistakes have certainly been made by Peter Moores and this management.

They had six months to prepare for this tournament rather than in two of the last three World Cups when they have come in to it off the back of the Ashes.

They changed the captain just ahead of this tour which to me was not the wrong call but one made too late. They should have replaced Alastair Cook a year ago and then Alex Hales could have been opening the batting for a year by now.

Then at the last minute here they came up with this cunning plan of picking Gary Ballance which smacked of England losing their bottle and reverting to old-fashioned type and going with the Test No3.

And why did it take until this game for Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad to pitch the ball up? Eoin Morgan said it wasn’t a team plan so why were they bowling too short and why didn’t someone tell them to stop it before now?

Yet, in all honesty, I watched that match and I wasn’t too fussed about the result because my feeling is that even if England had won and gone on to the quarter-final they would have been hammered by India, South Africa or whoever they faced on a drop-in pitch at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

England are playing a different brand of cricket from the top five or six teams and the underlying problems need to be looked at as much as the position of the coach, who comes under scrutiny after every tournament disappointment.

There are exciting players out there. You could tell that Hales had something about him two years ago. Then there are others like Sam Billings and Jason Roy. We need someone with a keen eye picking these guys out and then sending them round the world to play in the Indian Premier league, the Big Bash and other tournaments where they may learn.

One-day cricket cannot be an afterthought any more for England. There is no magic fix but we must change our culture. Let the players have a carefree attitude – not reckless – but carefree. Then start moving forward and catching up.
