THE FISH LADDER

by Katharine Norbury

(Bloomsbury £16.99)

When Katharine Norbury was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of breast cancer in her mid-40s, she told the radiographer: ‘I have a ten‑year-old daughter. I have to live.’

Katharine Norbury tells of her emotional journey to reconnect with her family (picture posed by model)

The doctor asked if there was a history of breast cancer in her family, but Norbury didn’t know. She was adopted.

Attempts to trace her biological mother had failed and her father was merely a dash on a birth certificate. Though she was raised by wonderful adoptive parents, she had always felt ‘dizzyingly adrift’.

This uncertainty about her own origins drives her to seek out more tangible sources: those of rivers around the British Isles. In this crisp, poetic little book, Norbury describes her walks beside rivers, including the Thames, Mersey and Severn.

She first began these walks to ward off the depression she felt looming after a late miscarriage, not many months before the cancer diagnosis.

She had suffered from mental illness before. While working as a successful TV script editor, she had awoken from an unexplained blackout to find herself coughing blood down a sink, while her husband (novelist Rupert Thomson) sobbed in the shower beside her, with his head in his hands.

She had a feeling she had been screaming, but no memory of what or why. Another time she made herself a cup of tea and walked to her bedroom window. As she pulled the curtains, she found five other cups lined up along the sill, each in various stages of cooling.

Norbury knew she could not go back into that dark place. She had to stay sane and strong for daughter Evie, who had longed for a brother. So she began to walk.

Evie keeps her mother company on some of these adventures, but Norbury’s most extraordinary journeys are taken alone.

A scary man is spotted hurling rocks into the sea. She is too afraid of him to pass, and so makes the bizarre decision to curl up and sleep in the sand dunes until he has gone. When she awakes, he is there and she retreats to her car, only to find somebody has let her tyres down.

Although her birth mother has made no effort to contact her, Norbury finds her living near the source of the River Severn.

She walks past this woman’s house and fantasises about a reunion of flowers and chocolates. She imagines receiving a letter confessing: ‘I love you. There has not been one day when I have not thought of you.’

Instead she receives a cold rebuff: a nasty note explaining she was the result of a ‘quickie’ at a party in Australia and had been delivered under general anaesthetic so that her mother never even saw her and wants to hear no more about the ‘horrible’ matter.

The rejection makes it easier for Norbury to ignore her wishes and she traces her half (or possibly full) brothers, Robert and Ioan, in Wales. Online she finds a rugby team photograph and in it a ‘smiling man, who had my daughter’s eyes’.

They go along to a match and Norbury realises how much an uncle might mean to little Evie.

A few days after the match, Evie is holding a bundle: ‘Soft and fluffy, and smelling of milk and fabric softener.’ Her baby cousin.

As mother and daughter drive home, they pass the village where Norbury’s birth mother lives. They don’t stop. Coming out of the slick, wet darkness of a storm, they count seven rainbows in the sky ahead.
