Set back: Cameron now has no hope of passing the legislation for a vote on EU membership before the next Queen's Speech after 245 peers voted to halt it

A bill to enshrine a European referendum in law was described as a ‘dead parrot’ last night after Labour and the Lib Dems united to block it.

Nearly 250 peers voted to halt the Bill – backed by David Cameron – which would guarantee a nationwide in-out vote on EU membership in 2017.

Peers passed two amendments to the legislation, effectively guaranteeing that it will run out of time in this Parliamentary session.

Arch Eurosceptic MP Bill Cash echoed a Monty Python sketch in pronouncing its demise.

He said: ‘As I understand it from the House of Lords, the European Union Referendum Bill is now, in effect, a dead parrot.’

Mr Cameron has vowed to renegotiate Britain’s relationship with Brussels before holding a referendum in 2017.

But he could not introduce government legislation because of Lib Dem opposition.

Instead, No10 backed a Private Member’s Bill introduced by Tory MP James Wharton, which was passed in the Commons after Labour and the Lib Dems abstained.

Labour leader Ed Miliband has refused to make his position on the Bill clear but Labour and Lib Dem peers tabled 73 amendments to the Bill, many of them frivolous, to kill it off.

Peers voted by 245 votes to 158 to amend the wording of the question that would be put to voters in the referendum.

The change was backed by 67 Liberal Democrats, 138 Labour, 30 crossbench and just three Conservatives.

EU red tape is costing British jobs and has imposed ‘unjustified’ blockages on cheap energy from shale gas, David Cameron said yesterday.

Addressing the World Economic Forum in Davos, the Prime Minister complained that ‘overwritten’ employment directives were driving employers away from the UK.

He also said that failure to back shale gas exploration in Europe would cause businesses and investors to ‘head elsewhere’. The opportunities it presented could be undermined if the EU imposed unnecessary regulations.

They also passed a second amendment that would require an impact assessment on the potential consequences of an EU exit.

The change means the European Union (Referendum) Bill will have to go back to the Commons for further consideration.

Since Private Member’s Bills can only be debated on Fridays, there is now no prospect of the legislation going through before the next Queen’s Speech.

Lord Hill, Conservative Leader of the Lords, accused Labour and the Lib Dems of ‘yet another U-turn’ on their position on an EU referendum.

‘Having accepted this Bill in the House of Commons, they are now trying to kill it in the Lords,’ he said.

A No10 source said the Tories would try to get another MP to reintroduce the legislation in the Commons in the next session of Parliament.
