A Philadelphia man was executed Monday in a crowded bodega in broad daylight.

Kontue Johnson, 21, was shot 14 times just before 5pm Monday by masked gunman in front of at least 10 people. The gunman escaped shortly after shocking scene unfolded, leaving the new father for dead.

Mr Johnson was well-known to police, according to NBC Philadelphia, but a Philadelphia Police Department spokesperson declined to comment on his past when reached by MailOnline.

Security footage reviewed by investigators showed the masked assassin shooting at and chasing Mr Johnson through the store before the victim collapsed in an aisle, WPVI reported.

The killer then stood over the his cowering victim, a young father, firing more than a dozen bullets – hitting him in the face and torso, CBS Philadelphia reported.

‘The shooter stood over him and fired several more shots, standing right over the victim,’ a police spokesperson told WPVI. ‘It's clearly an execution type homicide,’ the spokesperson continued, ‘this victim was clearly targeted.’

The shots rang out from a semi-automatic handgun, according to Philly.com.

Friends took to Twitter to express their grief over Mr Johnson's death.

'I Didn't Think That Would Be Our Last Time Speaking Or Seeing Each Other,' one person tweeted.

'It just feels weird strolling down my [timeline] seeing his face & RIP next to it,' another friend tweeted.

Paramedics arrived soon after the murderer fled the scene and took Mr Johnson to a local hospital, he was pronounced dead a short time later, according to reports.

‘It hurts a lot, it really does,’ Lucy Siberio told WPVI. ‘Just to see this happen, in this store where they’re really good people.’

The store’s owner told CBS Philadelphia he has never had any problems in the past. He has owned the store for six years – ‘no, never.’
