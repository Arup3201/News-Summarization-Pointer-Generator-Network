His stomach tattoo, coincidentally etched with the word 'Stretch,' actually refers to an old nickname because of The Game's six-foot-four frame.

Martin, just 17 years old, was fatally shoot on Feb 26, 2012 in Sanford, Florida.

George Zimmerman, the neighborhood-watch volunteer who fatally shot him, was acquitted by a jury of second degree murder and manslaughter charges in July.

The reaction to the verdict led to protests and marches of people contesting the 'stand-your-ground' law, which is a type of self-defense law that gives someone the right to use deadly force to defend themselves.
