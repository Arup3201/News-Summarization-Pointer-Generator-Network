Two weeks ago, Mitt Romney was anxiously waiting at his campaign's headquarters in Boston to hear the results of the election.

After his crippling loss, pictures surfaced of the former Massachusetts governor drowning his sorrows in a gallon of chocolate milk. He was recently pictured with his distinctive salt-and-pepper hair unceremoniously unkempt, and has been spotted going to the gym with his wife, Ann.

And now, two weeks to the day since he lost the election to President Obama, Romney went to Disneyland, a place typically saved for when public figures experience victory.

All smiles: Romney appeared to be having a good time two weeks to the day that he lost the election to President Obama

The 65-year-old former Republican 
presidential nominee was wearing a blue checked shirt with his 
shirtsleeves rolled, looking decidedly more put-together than he had 
pumping his own gas earlier this week.

He appeared to be visiting the park his grandchildren, with Ann by his side bundled up in a red Patagonia jacket.

Another
Twitter user posted a picture of Romney and Ann aboard the Luigi's 
Flying Tires ride inside the Disney California Adventure Park.

The
gentle ride, which is inspired by the Disney-Pixar film 'Cars,' lets 
riders sit within an over-sized tire that levitates along the surface.

Park-goers took to Twitter to post photos of Romney, voicing their surprise to see the muti-millionaire among them.

One user wrote: 'Yo, Mitt Romney is at DisneyLand. I just saw him,' followed by the hashtags #Crazy and #TooDressedUpToHaveFun.

Another user said: ‘Thought going to Disneyland was what one does after winning something.’

Earlier this week, Romney was 
pictured at a gas station near San Diego, filling his tank. ‘Mitt Romney
at my local gas station... he looks tired and washed up,’ wrote mkb95, 
who posted the photo on Reddit.

The photographer goes on to explain that he ‘talked to him (Romney) for a good three minutes while he was filling his tank,’ and even learned that he's planning to move ‘to one of his houses’ in La Jolla.

The Romney’s have a $12million oceanfront mansion in the neighborhood La Jolla, near San Diego.

Mitt and his wife Ann are adjusting to civilian life without the perks that go with running for office. During the presidential campaign, they received 24 hour protection from the U.S. Secret Service but all that stopped the morning after the election.

Last Saturday, the couple was spotted enjoying date night in nearby Del Mar. Grainy photographs show the pair, minus security, heading to the Cinepolis movie theatre to watch the new Twilight film.

Fans: They then headed across the street for pizza, where they dutifully posed with other diners for pictures

They then headed for dinner at Sammy's, a pizza restaurant across the street. Romney was reportedly extremely friendly with fellow diners and even posed for pictures.

As Republican Party start to come to terms with the scale of its election day defeat, the former governor has become persona non grata to the party at large - a remarkable fall from grace which he is said to be taken aback by.

Romney was widely praise for his gracious concession speech, but divisive comments since then have put him at odds with party leaders.
