Jay Penske and former Victoria's Secret model Elaine Irwin have announced that they are expecting their first child.

The Nineties supermodel, 43, is due this summer. She already has two teenage sons from her previous marriage to John Mellencamp.

Mr Penske, 34, who is the youngest son of auto magnate Roger 
Penske, confirmed the happy news at yesterday's IndyCar race in Birmingham, Alabama.

He told Indystar.com that he and Ms Irwin married last October in India, though their engagement was only confirmed in January of this year.

According to the New York Post, Mr Penske was seen with Ms Irwin at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, 'introducing her as his fiancée.'

A rep for Mr Penske’s company, PMC, then told the newspaper at the time: 'I can confirm Jay and Elaine were 
engaged around late October last year, while they were on a trip to 
India.'

Ms Irwin, who 
is nine years Mr Penske’s senior, was married to rock singer-songwriter 
John Mellencamp for 20 years. The pair divorced in August 2011, and Mr Mellencamp requested that Elaine be returned to her maiden name 
'Irwin'.
