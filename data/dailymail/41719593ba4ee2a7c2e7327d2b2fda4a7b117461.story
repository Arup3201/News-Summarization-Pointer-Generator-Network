Chelsea host Manchester City in this weekend's huge top-of-the-table clash at Stamford Bridge on Saturday - and these two sides have been impressive in the Premier League this season.

The Blues are without the injured Cesc Fabregas and the suspended Diego Costa, while Manuel Pellegrini's men are missing Yaya Toure who is still at the Africa Cup of Nations.

Here, Sportsmail's Jamie Redknapp picks the strongest possible XIs available for both sides and gives his verdict on which team is better...

The clash between Jose Mourinho and Manuel Pellegrini's sides could potentially decide the league title

THIBAUT COURTOIS 9

The best keeper in the league. His ability and calmness are outstanding for his age.

His concentration is so good and he makes saves when needed.

BRANISLAV IVANOVIC 8.5

One of the best right backs the Premier League has seen.

Powerful, influential and a monster at set-pieces. He has become an absolute warrior.

Branislav Ivanovic is one of the best right backs the Premier League has ever seen

KURT ZOUMA 8

A young man with a big future.

Prone to a mistake but has incredible pace, a good leap and can be a powerhouse with more confidence and experience.

Kurt Zouma is prone to a mistake but has incredible pace, a good leap and is a powerhouse

JOHN TERRY 9

Having one of his best seasons for Chelsea.

New signings have breathed life into him and his understanding of the game is still exceptional.

CESAR AZPILICUETA 8

Does a good job defensively but playing a right-footer at left back means you lose a bit going forward.

His battle with Jesus Navas should be a great contest.

Cesar Azpilicueta (right) does a good job defensively for Chelsea but struggles going forward from left back

RAMIRES 8

Something of a bit-part player this season but plays at great pace and loves getting after people.

Big role in stopping David Silva.

Ramires (left) has been a bit-part player this season but has great pace that can be utilised

NEMANJA MATIC 9

Has become vital in that ‘Claude Makelele’ role, but there is more to his game.

He has a cultured left foot and with no Cesc Fabregas he can help keep up the tempo.

Nemanja Matic has become vital in defensive midfield for Chelsea but can also dictate the game's tempo

OSCAR 8.5

A bit disappointing against Liverpool but he works hard and is the first to go and press to win the ball.

He’s a real goal threat, too.

Oscar works hard, is the first to press the ball for Chelsea and is a real threat in front of goal for the Blues

EDEN HAZARD 9

Hazard can decide this game but because we know what he can do I would like to see more from him, certainly in terms of variety.

Eden Hazard (left) can be the player to decide this game due to his pace, trickery and finishing prowess

WILLIAN 8

Has great skill and a fine work ethic Jose Mourinho has helped instil, but with the way he can go past players I would like to see more end product.

Willian has a fine work ethic that Jose Mourinho has instilled in him and will run tirelessly for his side

DIDIER DROGBA 8

Was a 10/10 player but time has ticked on.

He can provide a focal point at set-pieces but can he still score in the big games? Just ask Manchester United.

TOTAL: 93/110 

Didier Drogba can provide a focal point at set pieces for Chelsea and could turn back the clock on Saturday

Manager: JOSE MOURINHO 9

His record speaks for itself, though he has not won a trophy for two years. That will change this season.

He gets the best out of people and his team are in a great position to win the title. Now they just have to do it.

Jose Mourinho's record speaks for itself - he gets the best out of players and wins big matches

MANCHESTER CITY (4-4-1-1) 

JOE HART 8.5

Recovered well after a tough spell last year and up there with the best, though not quite at Courtois’ level.

Will be keen to atone for a mistake here last season.

Joe Hart (left) endured a tough spell last year but is still up there with the best keepers in the league

PABLO ZABALETA 9

I love him. He’s the sort of player every youngster in the country should watch as he gives 100 per cent in every game.

His will be a great battle with Hazard.

Pablo Zabaleta (centre) is an almost ever-present starter in the Manchester City first XI

VINCENT KOMPANY 9

If we were doing this last year he is a 9.5, but at the moment he is struggling for form and fitness.

He’ll be pleased to see Diego Costa is not playing.

Vincent Kompany (left) is struggling for form and fitness at the moment but is a class act

MARTIN DEMICHELIS 8

When he arrived here everyone, including myself, questioned him.

But he has adapted and has been City’s most consistent defender this season.

Martin Demichelis endured a tough start to his City career but is their most consistent defender this season

GAEL CLICHY 7.5

Faced one of his most difficult periods a few months ago when he was short of confidence.

But has come through it and provides a good contest out wide.

Gael Clichy (left) faced a difficult period a few months ago when he was short of confidence

JESUS NAVAS 8

Seems to be a Pellegrini favourite but doesn’t do enough for me.

Can catch pigeons with his pace but will need it to help out Zabaleta against Hazard.

Jesus Navas (centre) seems to be a Pellegrini favourite but he doesn't offer enough around the park

FERNANDO 8

Plays a similar role to Fernandinho, but neither are in Matic’s league.

In some games he will run through brick walls for you but in others he has less impact.

Fernando is inconsistent - sometimes in runs through brick walls but other games he has less impact

FERNANDINHO 8

Brilliant last year and one reason why City won the title.

Fernando’s arrival unsettled him and they have not clicked. But without Yaya, options are limited.

Fernandinho (right) was brilliant last year as City won the title but has been unsettled this campaign

JAMES MILNER 8

Enjoying one of his best seasons.

When everyone is fit, he might not make City’s best side but has a top work ethic and is now a go-to player for Pellegrini.

James Milner (left) has a top work ethic and he is now a go-to player for Pellegrini

DAVID SILVA 9.5

My favourite player on the pitch. Might not grab the headlines but I would pay to watch him every day.

Chelsea will fret over him more than anyone else.

David Silva (left) may not grab the headlines but he is the player who makes City tick

SERGIO AGUERO 9.5

When fit, Aguero is a 10/10 player.

He struggles coming back from injuries but has two games under his belt and can decide this game in an instant.

TOTAL: 93/110  

Sergio Aguero is a 10/10 player when he is fit but he is struggling to return to top form after injury

Manager MANUEL PELLEGRINI 8.5

Won the title last season but that was more down to his squad - and I still feel there are more questions around him than answers. His players love him but there will be no love lost with Mourinho on Saturday.

Manuel Pellegrini's side will fall eight points behind Chelsea if they lose at Stamford Bridge on Saturday
