Self-proclaimed 'party princess' Karlie Tomica had a blood-alcohol content that was three times the legal limit when she allegedly killed South Beach chef Stefano Riccioletti in a hit-and-run.

Tomica, a 20-year-old bartender, was driving a 2007 Dodge Charger along Collins Avenue in Miami Beach January 28 when she struck 49-year-old Riccioletti yards away from the Shelbourne Hotel, where Riccioletti works, and kept driving, according to police. Riccioletti, a father of three, died at the scene.

A witness who placed an initial 911 call around 6 a.m. followed Tomica home and described her as being ‘really drunk.’

Charges: Karlie Tomica, pictured left on her Twitter profile and right, in her booking photo, is accused of leaving the scene of a fatal hit-and-run resulting in the death of a well-known Miami chef

Party girl: Tomica said on her Twitter page that she is a 'party princess' who's 'livin' the dream;' her profile has since been deleted

Loss: Stefano Riccioletti was the executive chef at The Shore Club's Terrazza; he was killed early Monday morning in the hit-and-run

‘I’m actually just following a car that 
just hit a man on Collins Avenue,’ the man said on 911 tapes, which were
released today. ‘As far as I know, at this time, she must have killed 
him.’

Tomica will now be charged with DUI 
manslaughter. Before the results of the toxicology report were known, 
Tomica was only charged with leaving the scene of a fatal accident.

Tomica styled herself as a 'Miami Beach Part Princess Livin' the Dream' on her Twitter page.

She was apparently driving home after her shift at Nikki Beach, a bar and nightclub, on the night of the crash.

One of Riccioletti's sons has filed a
lawsuit against Tomica as well as Nikki Beach and its owners alleging 
that the club allowed her to drink underage while at work. Riccioletti's
widow has also filed a lawsuit against Tomica and Nikki Beach.

Mr Riccioletti was the executive chef
at the exclusive Shore Club within the hotel and was on his way to work
at the time that he was struck.

According to police reports, Riccioletti was thrown several feet into the hotel’s driveway when Tomica allegedly hit him with her car.

Witness: This Good Samaritan, who declined to be identified, was integral in tracking down the young woman and reporting the alleged crime

The witness who followed Tomica back to her home said that upon reaching her apartment, the young woman got out of her vehicle, handed the keys to a valet, and went into her apartment. 

When officers arrived at her apartment, they said in their report that Tomica had slurred speech and smelled of alcohol. She was pictured by NBC Miami being led from her apartment into custody, mascara streaks marring her face.

Tomica is pictured in tears in her booking photo, clutching her hands into fists below her face.

According to records, Tomica is from Port St. Lucie and has been a student at Florida International University.

The University told MailOnline she is currently not enrolled at the institution.

Both Tomica’s Twitter and Facebook pages have been deleted. 

Lucy Martin, the general manager of the Shore Club, issued a statement saying that Mr Riccioletti was ‘a valued member of our team and will be greatly missed.’
