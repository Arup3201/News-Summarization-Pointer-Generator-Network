Gary Hake, 35, discovered he could dribble tea out of a hole in his chin after cutting it during a game of football

As a keen footballer, it is no surprise that Gary Hake is good at dribbling - but not in quite the way you might imagine.

When the burly teacher cut his chin during a football game, it reopened an old wound and, as he sat in hospital waiting to be patched up, he discovered he could dribble tea out of the hole.

Rather than chasing the doctors to take a look at him, the 35-year-old from Chatham, Kent, decided to video his unusual new trick, before posting the horrifying footage online.

Mr Hake, a father of two, was hit in the face as he jumped for a header during a game with his team, Sheppey and Sheerness United FC, on Saturday.

He said: 'I remember jumping up for a header and then I’m not entirely sure what happened.

'I don’t know if it was an elbow or what but the next thing I remember is coming down in a bit of a daze with blood everywhere.'

The accident reopened an old wound, but Mr Hake plugged the bleeding hole below his lip with Vaseline and played on for 10 minutes before he was taken to Sheppey Community Hospital.

Waiting to be seen, he discovered he could spurt tea from the hole, and asked his niece to film it on her mobile phone.

She then posted the gruesome footage on Facebook.

Mr Hake said: 'The accident opened up a wound from about nine years ago, although this time itw as a lot worse.

'When I did it nine years ago, I thought about doing the thing with the tea then, so this time I thought I’m not going to miss the opportunity to do it this time.

'I didn’t hurt. I think it helped clean it out a bit.'

Mr Hake, who had two stitches to the wound, retired from football last year after 30 years of games but was persuaded to sign up again at the start of the season.
