Former mining magnate and racing figure Nathan Tinkler will sell his assets in a bid to pay back debts

Former mining magnate and racing figure Nathan Tinkler has became a father for the fifth time with his former executive assistant, 'pretty blonde' Jodie Van Gilst, Sydney Morning Herald reports.

Ms Van Gilst recently gave birth and is reportedly living at Tinkler's Singapore luxury suite in the Marina Collection development.

Tinkler's former spokesman, who says the 38-year-old currently doesn't have a manager, told Daily Mail Australia the new baby was born about two weeks ago.

The spokesman, who no longer represents Tinkler, was unable to provide further details.

Tinkler's estranged wife, Rebecca, resides in Hawaii with the couple's four children since last year, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

They are living in their $16 million mansion in the 'exclusively gated community' of Keauhou on the island of Maui.

The Hawaii home was purchased in November 2011, just before the troubled billionaire was forced to announce fire sale of his various assets and undergo the repossession of his private jet and a Falcon 900.

Australian entrepreneur and horseracing businessman Gerry Harvey said Tinkler owes him nearly $40 million.

Mr Harvey now controls all of Tinkler's Patinack horse breeding and racing assets, which will be auctioned at the Magic Millions in September.

According to Private Sydney, the Tinkler marriage was already on the rocks but it was 'the final straw' when Van Gilst's pregnancy became apparent to Rebecca.

Ms Van Gilst, from Queensland, had enjoyed reoccurring trips to the exclusive Birdcage marquees at the Melbourne Cup.

In 2012, Ms Van Gilst was spotted at the Melbourne Grand Prix with her now baby's father but Tinkler's spokesman shut down the reports, stating they were there 'purely on business.'

Tinkler declared just $9800 in personal taxable income in 2010-11.

He is currently under investigation with ICAC due to allegations in a corrupt scheme to pay illegal donations to Liberal Party candidates.

These claims have been denied by Tinkler.
