They are moments of simple joy, showing a young family at play and providing a touching insight into the warmth that infused the childhood of Prince Charles and Princess Anne.

In one image from previously unseen royal home movies the two young royals are seen dancing in their bathing towels across a beach in Norfolk.

In another amusing scene the Queen is seen waving on her two eldest children as they cycle in convoy with Prince Philip – who’s mounted on a bike that’s way too small for him.

In other images Charles sits at the wheel of his toy car and stands in his riding gear by his pony.

There’s no footage of Her Majesty bathing the children with her crown on, but Prince Charles assures us that she did just that.

The footage was last night shown on the BBC programme A Jubilee Tribute To The Queen By The Prince Of Wales, giving a rare glimpse into some of Her Majesty’s most deeply personal moments.

The inclusion of the home movies in the documentary was seen as a gesture by the Royal Family to allow greater public insight into the private life of the monarch. The Prince pays a son’s loving tribute to what he calls his mother’s ‘natural grace’.

Making a cameo appearance at one point is Winston Churchill, 80 at the time, and seen sitting on the edge of a lake at Balmoral.

Charles says: ‘It must have been quite reassuring for Mama to have someone like that when she first started – all that experience going back a long way. The shoe’s on the other foot now.’

The film collection comprises probably the most intimate look at the Queen throughout her reign, a cinematic family album.

In another shot, Charles leaps from the top of a sand dune, tumbling as he hits the ground and laughing and giggling as he appears to show off in front of the camera.

It is the kind of happy holiday snapshot that graces family photograph albums and personal video collections in homes across the country.

Watching it from Birkhall, his Scottish home not far from Balmoral, the Prince of Wales watched the footage with fondness, not speaking about what he was watching but was clearly enjoyed it as he laughed along gently.

Frolicking around: A young Prince Charles plays without a care in the world and is seen in one of the clips jumping around in the sand dunes at Holkham Bay

Prince Charles appears to be full of beans as he lands in the sands of the dunes, falling into a heap at the bottom. Watching the footage again, the Prince laughed fondly

In another scene, pictured on 
glorious Holkham Beach in Norfolk in the summer of 1957, Prince Charles 
and his sister, Princess Anne, smile for the camera after being buried 
up to their necks by their father, the Duke of Edinburgh.

The charming picture is a still taken from home video footage shot by the Queen herself.

Charles would have been about eight at the time and Anne – who looks identical to her daughter, Zara, as a child – around six.

It has been personally chosen by the 
prince for a television tribute to his mother to mark her Diamond 
Jubilee which will be broadcast on BBC1 tomorrow night.

Sources
 close to Charles said the carefree home movie has huge personal 
resonance for both the prince and his mother and is part of hundreds of 
hours of footage shot by the Queen of her young family.

Drawing
 on these never-seen-before shots as well as archive news reels, the 
Prince reflects back on her 60-year reign – both as the nation’s Queen 
and as his own mother.

‘The Diamond Jubilee gives us the chance
 to celebrate with pride all that The Queen means to us – whether as a 
nation or as one of her children,’ he says.

Throughout
 the film, the Prince shares memories and recalls events from both her 
public and private life, adding his own commentary and insights.

Among the great public moments of the reign for which he provides additional insight is the Coronation in 1953.

In one sequence, he recalls how The Queen practised wearing the Coronation crown around Buckingham Palace – even at bathtime.

‘I
 remember my Mama coming, you know, up, when we were being bathed as 
children, wearing the crown.  It was quite funny – practising,’ he says.

In more private cine camera footage, 
taken on Coronation Day, June 2 1953, behind the scenes at Buckingham 
Palace, we see Her Majesty juggling the dual role of mother and Queen as
 she walks along the corridor of Buckingham Palace and poses for 
official photographs. 

'Amazing poise': The Queen, pictured on her Coronation tour in October 1953, is held in 'respect and affection' by leaders across the globe, Charles says

Watching
 the footage some sixty years later, the Prince comments on his mother’s
 ‘amazing poise’ and, later, her ‘natural grace’.

Although
 the prince and his mother have found themselves at odds over the years,
 with Charles accusing her of being a somewhat aloof figure, he adds: 
‘My Mama takes great pride in her family, from being a young mother at 
the start of her reign, to now being a great grandmother twice over.’

He
 demonstrates this by showing pictures to illustrate the more personal 
aspect of very public moments, such as his mother and father visiting 
him on sports day Hill House School, West London, in the summer of 1957.

In his tribute, the prince also draws extensively from news archive to remind us of key public moments such the spectacle of the Coronation, and The Queen’s many overseas tours and visits.

‘I think just the sheer number of Heads of State who are coming to the Jubilee celebrations shows the respect and affection with which my mama is held all around the world,’ he says.

‘I so admire the way she’s managed to hold that unique association – the Commonwealth – together.’

The Prince also points out that The Queen has opened Parliament in Britain 59 times, adding: ‘I’ve always thought my Mama looks absolutely wonderful in that tiara’ before noting that two of her twelve Prime Ministers were not even born when she came to the throne.

‘The fact that my Mama has been a constant feature on the scene has provided that sense, I think, of continuity in a time of immense change over 60 years,’ he says.

‘The Queen has provided an amazing record of devotion, dedication and commitment.’
