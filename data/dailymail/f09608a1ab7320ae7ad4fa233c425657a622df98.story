It could have been cat-astrophic, but these runway kittens still have all nine lives in tact after train authorities came to their rescue today.

When two tiny felines were spotted frolicking on the train tracks near the Church Avenue station in Brooklyn about 11am, Metropolitan Transportation Authority workers turned off the power.

Passengers on the B and Q lines were stranded for about two hours while police officers chased the cats down the tracks.

According to the Wall Street Journal,
a spokeswoman said police officers went onto the tracks to roust the 
cats so they wouldn't be at risk. She also said the MTA did not wish to 
accidentally 'fry' the kittens.

Crews suspended regular service from 
DeKalb Avenue to Brighton Beach and Stillwell just after 11am and provided shuttle buses, according to NY Daily News.

Service was restored once the kitties scurried off the tracks. However it's not clear what happened to the tiny cats.

The Journal also speculated the MTA's reaction was so extravagant after it was forced to explain why a dead shark was found on an N train at Queens Plaza earlier this month.
