A criminal convicted of harassment and theft was allowed to freely roam a court building for more than an hour after being jailed - because there were no prison cells in which to hold him.

Ryan Goss, 19, boasted that he could have easily ‘done a runner’ when magistrates politely asked him to wait at the back of Worcester Magistrates’ Court after they handed him a 16-week jail term.

Goss was locked up last Thursday for breaching the community order part of his suspended prison sentence - but was told could not be taken to jail straight away because the cells were shut that day.

Convicted criminal: Ryan Goss, 19, boasted that he could have easily 'done a runner' when magistrates politely asked him to wait at the back of a court after they handed him a 16-week jail term

The building was short of security staff, so Goss - who had previously skipped bail - was instead told to wait at the back of the courtroom. But he loitered outside with other members of the public.

He also ate chocolate from a vending machine, smoked in the toilets, phoned his work to say he was going to be ‘off for a while’, chatted to friends and arranged for clothes to be brought to him in jail.

Eventually a security van arrived from 36 miles away in Wolverhampton - one hour and five minutes later - to drive Goss a further 70 miles to HMP Glen Parva in Wigston, Leicestershire.

Speaking after his sentencing, Goss laughed how he could have walked free from court and would have done if he had been given a longer sentence. He even joked about being a ‘free man’.

Goss said: ‘Last year, when I did a runner they couldn’t catch me for four months - and now they’re putting all this trust in me. I was really surprised. I have been able to call five or six people.

‘I have just sorted out someone to bring me my clothes. I haven’t got any cuffs on me. I’m still a free man. Normally, I would be in a cell now, waiting, but I have time to sort things out.

‘I even rang up work and said I wouldn’t be in. It’s inhumane treatment - tempting me to do a runner and with all the things I have got going for me in my life at the moment.

‘If I had been given a longer sentence I’d be gone by now. At the moment, I will be out before Christmas, and if I ran away I would just be sent down for longer - but it’s only two months.

‘I might as well just do it. If it was a longer stretch there would be no chance I’d be waiting here.’

The court heard Goss had breached an original order, which was put in place for harassment, theft and failing to surrender to bail, which included completing 100 hours of unpaid work.

He had only completed 25 hours. But he was told by magistrates that because the cells were closed on Tuesdays and Thursdays and the court were short-staffed, he would have to wait to be taken away.

Chairman of the magistrates Ray Needham said: ‘You have a persistent disregard for court orders and we feel it would not be unjust to activate the custodial sentence. Wait at the back of court until the security staff arrive.

'You are in lawful custody and must remain in the court. We are short of security staff. That is why you have not been taken down immediately.’

After the hearing even Goss’s solicitor, Mark Turnbull, admitted the decision did ‘not make any sense’, saying: ‘There is a risk of people walking out the door.

‘It is a hell of a temptation when you’ve just been given a prison sentence. I can’t see the sense of it. 

'There is a concern that some people will do a runner. It seems this has just been imposed on the court without anyone thinking it through.’

'It is just a matter of time before someone does a runner. It is an absolute joke'

Rob Macrory, local solicitor

Local solicitor Rob Macrory also branded the ruling ‘a farce’ and said new regulations mean Worcester criminals are now held in custody at neighbouring courts in Redditch and Kidderminster.

However, Goss was not transferred to these courts or Worcester Crown Court over the road, where the majority of security staff were based that day.

Mr Macrory said: ‘It’s a farce. This has only just come into play around two weeks ago.

‘What has happened is the cells are closed at Worcester Magistrates’ Court on Tuesday and Thursday, the dock officers are moved to the crown court across the road.

Surprise: Speaking after his sentencing, Goss laughed how he could have walked free from court

‘All prisoners at Worcester go to Redditch Magistrates on Tuesday and Kidderminster on Thursday. On Monday, Wednesday and Friday, Kidderminster and Redditch prisoners then move to Worcester.

‘This has caused massive delays in the courts and no one has thought to plan this through at all - it was an accident waiting to happen.

‘The court has probation breach cases and trials on Tuesday and Thursday, but if someone is convicted, they can’t go to prison straight away.

‘This applies to everyone, even someone who has committed a serious assault - it is just a matter of time before someone does a runner. It is an absolute joke.

‘With the case of Ryan Goss, although they had officers and vans across the road at the crown court, they didn’t think to call them to walk across the road and deal with the problem,

‘It is lucky he didn’t escape. Mr Goss is the only incident so far, but I believe this closing of the cells will be happening on a national scale soon.’

A spokesman from Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service insisted Goss was not considered a risk to the public. He said: ‘Worcester Magistrates Court does not list custody cases on Thursdays.

‘This was an unexpected custody case and the defendant was required to wait on court premises for an hour to be collected by the prisoner escort service.

‘The defendant was not considered a risk to the public by the court and remained inside the building during this time.’
