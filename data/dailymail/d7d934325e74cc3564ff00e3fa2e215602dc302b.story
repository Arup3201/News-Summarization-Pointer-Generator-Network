An Argentinian family has found itself on the receiving end of a barrage of online abuse after one of their goats gave birth to a calf with a ‘human’ head.

The Villalba family from Centro, in the north-western Argentinian province of Salta, say they have been accused of bestiality after a friend posted  images of the still-born kid on social media.

The friend posted the image of the baby goat, believed to have been deformed as a result of pesticides, to show the effects of insect repellent use in the area.

Shortly afterwards the farming family were subjected to abuse and horrifying accusations by superstitious locals when the images went viral.

The Villalba family have been bombarded with accusations that somebody among their number had been having sex with their goat.

The farmer's wife Olga Villalba has now been forced into furious denials saying that neither her family nor any of their friends had interfered with the goat in any way when the mutant kid was born.

She said: ‘It was dead when it was born, we just want to get rid of it as quickly as possible so we buried it in a hole in the ground.

‘It was clearly a genetic mutation caused by the excessive use of pesticides.

‘Another neighbour who was here and was curious took a picture which they unfortunately posted online sparking these ridiculous allegations.’

The family added that some of the social media messages were extremely aggressive people convinced that it was only through a cross between human and goat that the bizarre offspring shown on the viral images could have been created.
