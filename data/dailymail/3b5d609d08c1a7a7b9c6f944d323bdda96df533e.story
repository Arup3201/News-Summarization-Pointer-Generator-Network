Homicide detectives have joined the investigation into the disappearance of toddler William Tyrell, the three-year-old  who disappeared from his grandmother's front yard more than three months ago.

In a major turn for the investigation, murder squad officers are now leading inquiries - meaning the case is no longer a missing persons investigation. 

Police and distraught family members hold grave fears for little William, who was dressed in his favourite Spiderman costume when he was last seen in Kendall on the mid-north cost of NSW on September 12.

More than 12 weeks on, Homicide Squad boss Detective Superintendent Michael Willing told the Sunday Telegraph that there have been no firm leads to suggest little William has been murdered but confirmed the investigation had taken a new direction.

'We want to do a thorough investigation to determine what's happened to William and obviously we need to consider the worst case scenario,' Supt Willing said. 

A NSW police spokeswoman confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that homicide detectives are now involved in the investigation.

'The homicide squad are involved to ensure thorough investigation but we have no evidence to suggest any particular scenario at this stage,' a police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia.

Detectives have spoken to every person they could locate who was in Kendall that day when the little boy disappeared at Benaroon Drive about 10.30am, five minutes after he was last seen by his grandmother and mother. He had been playing with his four-year-old sister.

The investigation into William's disappearance has passed the three months mark, as followers of a Facebook page set up to help find the little boy who loved fire engines topped 23,000.

As Christmas is fast approaching, members of the Kendall community have set up a Christmas tree at Kendall Services and Citizens Club, decked with his most-loved superhero, devoted to William.

The idea was set up by a local woman, who also runs the Facebook page called Bring Little Spiderman William Tyrell Home.

Detectives, who found no trace of William during an intense nine-day search and were concentrating their investigation on the theory that William was abducted, have previously described the case as 'astonishing'.

A huge search of surrounding properties and bushland failed to find a trace of the boy. 

One lead police have investigated is a report of a 'well-dressed, well-spoken' man who reportedly asked a local shopkeeper for directions to Batar Creek Road, which leads to Benaroon Drive, on the morning William disappeared.

State Emergency Service volunteers were among hundreds of searchers who spent nine days looking in bushland surroundings near the home

Earlier in October, Strike Force Rosann commander Acting Superintendent Tony Joice said police wanted to interview every person who was in Kendall on September 12 to determine what they were doing and why they were there.

'If you were in the Kendall area, we need to know what you were doing, who you were visiting, what car you were driving, what you were doing there,' Acting Superintendent Joice told the Daily Telegraph. 'It's about putting the pieces together.'

The search for William included police from the dog squad, officers on horseback and on trail bikes, divers, Forensic Services Group members and a helicopter.

Volunteers from the State Emergency Service, Rural Fire Service, Surf Life Saving, and local citizens scoured the main search area for nine days without finding any trace of the boy.

After five days police conceded the boy could not have survived in bushland alone. Some ground was searched more than 10 times.

Police interviewed William's sister but she was unable to provide any information about his disappearance. 

William's family have remained out of public view but a friend, Nicole, has made several appeals for help. She said while William enjoyed being outdoors he had no tendency to wander off.

'He is a happy, cheeky, adventurous little boy who doesn't wander off,' Nicole said. 'William is pretty much always happy. He was happy to play in the garden and be with his family.'

Little William has been missing 'without a trace' for more than three months since he was last seen in Kendell

Mid-North Coast local area commander Superintendent Paul Fehon has said 'someone, somewhere' must know something about William's disappearance. 

William's family thanked searchers for their hard work. 'Thank you does not seem like the right sort of word to express our gratitude and heartfelt warmth we feel towards each and every one of you,' a statement from the family said.

'We have been completely overwhelmed with the way the public, SES, Surf Life Saving, RFS and the Police have rallied together to find our little Spiderman William.'

Anyone with any information about William's disappearance is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
