She lost both her legs and encountered a near-death experience when she caught the underground train during the London terrorist bombings.

Gill Hicks was saved from the carnage, which killed 52 commuters on three trains and a bus after 19-year-old terrorist Germaine Lindsay detonated a suicide bomb next to her on July 7, 2005.

Nine years on, the Adelaide-born former designer has been named South Australia's 2015 Australian of the Year and will be in the running for the national awards to be announced on Sunday.

Clinging to life in a London hospital bed following the terror attack, Ms Hicks drew strength from the words that identified her on the tag across her wrist: 'One unknown, estimated female'.

'I realised people had risked their own lives to come and save this person who was "one unknown",' she said.

'It absolutely didn't matter to them what colour my skin was, what faith I had, how much money I had. Nothing mattered other than that I was a precious life.

'When I read that, it basically told me everything I needed to know about humanity, and equally about how I should build my world.'

She was the last person rescued alive from her carriage on the Piccadilly Line at Russell Square station and spent four days in a coma.

But Ms Hicks has since devoted endless hours to campaigning for sustainable peace and an end to the divisions that foster violent extremism.

Walking away from her successful designing career, she founded the charity MAD (Making A Difference) for Peace and inspired audiences as a motivational speaker and author.

At the core of her work, including her latest initiative #BeTheBridge, is the belief that everyone has a role to play in helping to promote unity.

'The more division that we have in our society, the more chasms and gaps there are in which people can slip into being susceptible to destructive ideology,' she says.

For Ms Hicks, this means educating people about cultural differences from an early age to prevent groups within society from becoming marginalised and feared.

She says there's also value in symbolic gestures, such as the #illridewithyou Twitter hashtag, aimed at supporting Muslim people feeling threatened by anti-Islamic sentiment after the Sydney siege.

Having recently given birth to her first daughter, Amelie, Ms Hicks says she's conscious of the permanency of her injuries but determined to channel her anger constructively.

'It's an absolute challenge but it keeps me focused.'

The Australian of the Year awards will be announced on Sunday January 25.
