Jailed: Conman Peter Thirlaway was sentenced for three years and four months after posing as a social worker

A conman who posed as a social worker to steal cash a pensioner had been saving to buy a headstone for his late wife's grave has been jailed.

Peter Thirlaway turned up at the 75-year-old widower's home claiming he was there to ensure the pensioner was getting all of the help and benefits he was entitled to after his wife died.

But Newcastle Crown Court heard the serial burglar produced a fake social services identity card to trick his way inside the house in Wallsend, North Tyneside.

While carrying out an 'inspection' of the rooms, the heartless fraudster helped himself to £260 from a drawer.

Judge John Milford QC jailed Thirlaway, who has convictions for 25 previous house burglaries, for three years and four months.

The said: 'You masqueraded as a member of social services who had come to help him make a claim for benefit.

'You managed to get into his bedroom and steal £260.

'That was money he had saved to pay for a headstone for his late wife.

'It must have been an immensely distressing experience for him to be duped in this way and to lose money which had such a special purpose and which he could, doubtless, ill afford.'

Prosecutor Paul Wardlaw told the court Thirlaway, 43, of no fixed address, had targeted the pensioner in September last year.

Mr Wardlaw said: 'The defendant told him he was there to assist him to make a claim for more benefits. He remained inside the address for an hour.

'He discussed medication the complainant was on.'

The court heard the widower, whose first language is Russian, wanted his daughter with him during the meeting but Thirlaway told him their discussions must be confidential.

Mr Wardlaw added: 'The defendant inspected the flat, he went all around, making notes.

'At one point it appears he has gone into a bedroom drawer where the complainant was keeping money he was saving to pay for a headstone for his deceased wife and stole £260.'

It was only when Thirlaway left that the pensioner realised the money had gone and he had been the victim of the scam.

Thirlaway was traced through fingerprints at the scene.

Robert Adams, defending, said Thirlaway planned the raid so he could flee the area after gangsters threatened him with a bullet. However, he said the conman has shown remorse for what he did.

Thirlaway admitted one count of burglary at a previous hearing.
