Double life: Frank Bough on Breakfast TV with co-star Selina Scott while he was still a presenter

The quiet village where Frank Bough has chosen to spend his latter years in self-imposed  exile could have been purposely designed to avoid unwanted attention.

The 81-year-old former BBC presenter’s home in Berkshire is on a corner plot with a secluded walled garden, and a  15-year-old Ford Focus sits on the narrow driveway.

Indeed, the un-starry house would not immediately strike you as the sort of place a man who was once among TV’s highest-earners would choose for his retirement.

Certainly, the property is big step down from his previous Thames-side mansion a few miles away, where Bough and his wife Nesta once threw glamorous garden parties for his showbusiness friends.

Those days, when Nesta used to be regularly seen by locals whizzing around the country lanes in her blue Toyota MR2 sports car are sadly, long gone.

Neighbours say Bough rarely ventures out. Instead, the former Breakfast Time TV, Grandstand and Nationwide host is content to potter around his garden or listen to classical music on the radio.

For the best part of 20 years, he has chosen to live in reclusive obscurity with his wife after the shame of two very public sex and drug scandals that brought his career to a premature end.

Now, however, the broadcaster is to make a return to our screens. He will appear in a forthcoming BBC2 documentary looking back at the 1983 launch of breakfast television which saw him anchor the BBC’s Breakfast Time.

His decision to emerge from the shadows is all the more surprising since he has steadfastly turned down invitations to mark previous anniversaries of the show.

Ex-colleagues say that his past refusals have stemmed from a fear of having to re-live his public infamy.

Certainly, for the 25th anniversary in 2008, he was absent when fellow former presenters Selina Scott, Sue Cook and others reunited on screen to reminisce about old times.

Likewise, friends confirm that he’s rebuffed several approaches from television producers down the  years keen to sound him out about a return to the small screen for other roles.

True to form, this week at his home Bough politely but firmly tells me: ‘I’m sorry, I’m not speaking to the Press.’

He has kept a dignified silence since he confessed to a newspaper about his one-time predilection  for prostitutes and cocaine,  shocking viewers who loved his homely, breakfast TV sofa image, complete with avuncular smile and comfy jumpers.

However, friends says Bough has now decided to restore his name as one of the finest broadcasters of his generation.

Talented: Frank Bough delivers a segment on the Breakfast programme

‘To put it bluntly, Frank doesn’t want be remembered any more for snorting coke with hookers in a seedy vice den,’ one BBC contemporary told me this week.

‘He’d rather people were talking about how he helped the Beeb trounce our rivals at TV-am when we both launched breakfast programmes 30 years ago.’

Bough’s decision comes at a time when the spotlight has been turned on the sexual habits of BBC staff during the Seventies and Eighties.

Former colleagues are rather surprised that against this backdrop, Bough has agreed to step back into the public eye.

Sally Jones, who became the network’s first woman sports presenter when she joined Bough on Breakfast Time in 1986, tells me that there is a big difference between her former colleague’s behaviour with consenting adults and the revelations about Jimmy Savile.

She said: ‘Many of us had numerous passes from other senior people within the BBC. I had a nasty run-in with Jimmy Savile in a lift when he tried to touch me up - and I gave him a real mouthful.

'But, I have to say, there was nothing at all like that from Frank towards me.’ However, Bough’s behaviour did elicit a hair-raising story from fellow presenter Fern Britton.

In her autobiography, she claimed that he once leaned over to whisper in her ear during the early days of her career: ‘Well, young lady, I wonder how long it will be before I am having an affair with you?’

She also alleged Bough was crude about his fellow Breakfast Time host, Selina Scott, of whom he is said to have observed ungallantly: ‘I bet she even rides a bike with her legs together.’

But it was not what happened in the office that would be his downfall. Instead, it happened in 1988, a year after he left Breakfast Time to become the presenter of the BBC’s Holiday programme.

One of the country’s highest-paid broadcasters - on a reputed £200,000 salary - he was sacked by the Corporation after a red-top Sunday newspaper revealed he had taken cocaine with prostitutes at a Mayfair brothel.

Amid a torrent of more damaging revelations, he attempted to stem the tide by giving an ill-advised interview to the now defunct News of the World in a bid to protect his marriage and spare his three sons humiliation.

In a grovelling mea culpa, he confessed to snorting cocaine with escort girls and drug-pushers and to watching couples have sex at wild parties, though he insisted the drug made him unable to have sex himself.

He said he’d been lured into the world of high-class prostitutes after being introduced to a French-born vice queen.

He insisted: ‘I’m not a wicked man, nor do I mean any harm or evil to people. I’ve made mistakes, but everyone’s entitled to do that. No one suffered but my wife, my family and myself.

'It was a brief but  appalling period in my life. Don’t condemn my entire career for a brief episode I regret.’

He then claimed a therapist had cured him of his cocaine habit and his ‘other life’ - ‘for good’.

Ex-colleague Sally Jones says she’s convinced Bough’s drug-taking was, in part, his way of beating the exhaustion caused by his workaholism and gruelling early-starts on breakfast TV.

‘One element of the problems he had may have been triggered by his absolutely punishing schedule,’ she says.

Mea culpa: Frank Bough, and his wife Nesta, in a revealing television interview following revelations about his sexual activities

She recalls how they had to get up at 3am or 4am to be ready for Breakfast Time and then often go on to front corporate videos or do media training.

‘I couldn’t believe how hard he pushed himself. Once, I remember we took a cab to South London after several hours of presenting Breakfast Time, both of us so tired we could hardly keep our eyes open.

‘I hadn’t the slightest inkling that he was doing cocaine, but in retrospect I think he may well have used it to help him stay awake and alert.

Still together: Nesta stood by Frank despite the revelations

‘Such early-starts, four or five mornings on the trot, meant that you were exhausted by the end of the week. It was attritional, and most of us agreed with  Selina Scott when she said that working on Breakfast aged you ten years.’

Despite his public shame, Bough’s wife, a physiotherapist, stood by him. When the scandal died down, he resumed his career and was recruited by LWT to present its show Six O’Clock Live and then ITV’s Rugby World Cup coverage.

However, more deeply embarrassing tabloid revelations were to follow after Bough was photographed leaving a sado-masochistic vice den. He was said to have  spent 50 minutes in a ‘torture chamber’ featuring a slave cage and school canes.

The following day he went on TV with his wife and said shamefacedly: ‘I am feeling exceedingly stupid. I bitterly regret many of the things in my life, and if only I could undo them I would.’

Now, surely, there was no return. Yet he took on some radio work, presenting a show on a London talk station before all-but disappearing from public life in 1996.

It was the end of a distinguished career.

Away from the spotlight, Bough joined a local choir in Windsor, the Royal Free Singers, and in 2001  had a liver transplant after being told he had only weeks to live  when doctors discovered a malignant tumour.

Now, though, it seems he wants to rehabilitate his reputation before it’s too late.

As his ex-colleague Sally Jones says: ‘Frank was a brilliant all-round presenter - one of the top two or three of his generation. It’s understandable that is how he’d like to be remembered.’

Whether that’s possible, at a time when the sexual morals of BBC  veterans are under such intense scrutiny, is quite another matter.
