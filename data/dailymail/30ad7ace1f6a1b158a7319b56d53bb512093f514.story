Her husband might be fending off corruption allegations but even that couldn't prevent Carla Bruni from raising a smile as she joined Jared Leto and Poppy Delevigne for a cocktail party in Paris.

The former French first lady was on glamorous form in a chic dark green dress and diamond necklace as she arrived for the event, thrown by jewellers Bulgari at upmarket restaurant, Apicius.

There, she happily posed with Bulgari CEO Jean-Christophe Babin before settling down for a martini with Babette Djian, editor-in-chief of French fashion magazine Numéro, and actress turned princess, Clotilde Coureau.

Bruni, a former model turned chanteuse, is the current face of Bulgari and has appeared in several campaigns for the jewellery brand.

Despite her modelling commitments, most of Bruni's energy is currently being directed at her singing career and a world tour that has already stopped off in Vienna, Berlin, Aix-en-Provence, New York, Quebec and Los Angeles.

The 46-year-old has also been spending more time with her daughter Giulia, three, who was born while her husband Nicholas Sarkozy was still president of France.

Although her career is going from strength to strength, her personal life is embroiled in turmoil thanks to corruption charges filed against her husband.

Mr Sarkozy, 59, was arrested and questioned for 12 hours last Thursday before being charged and released on police bail.

While Mr Sarkozy's family spoke of their anger at the charges, the former supermodel remained conspicuously silent, leaving her mother Marisa Bruni Tedeschi to speak up for her diminutive husband.

Ms Bruni Tedeschi said judges had ‘cut the legs’ off Mr Sarkozy, adding: ‘The real scandal is the theatrical flourish – the means and the moment chosen to bring the accusations against Nicolas.’

She added: ‘Strange that the enquiry is happening now – it’s the moment chosen which suggests a vendetta…Those who are close to him are scandalised.’

Worse still, Ms Bruni has also had to contend with front page stories claiming she and her husband are on the verge of separating, with the glossy ‘Ici Paris’ (Here, Paris) magazine running the story as a front page splash.

‘Carla and Nicolas: the end of a great story’ read the headline, which was accompanied by gloomy looking pictures of the couple.

An angry Mr Sarkozy has also accused judges of ‘humiliating me’ after being charged with 'active corruption', 'influence peddling', and 'violating the professional secrecy of an active judicial enquiry'.

Now facing up to 10 years in prison and a £400,000 fine, he said France should not have to put up with left-wing judges who wanted to scupper his possible return to power.

That, however, appears to have passed his wife by, with Ms Bruni seemingly putting her personal troubles behind her as she laughed and joked with A-listers, among them Jared Leto and Poppy Delevigne, at last night's party.

The party, one of the most glamorous events of Paris Couture Fashion Week, is a bi-annual tradition famous for the hordes of A-listers who attend.
