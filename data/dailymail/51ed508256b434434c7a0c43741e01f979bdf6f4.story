It may sound like a plot from 24, but a cyber security unit is asking for help to hack into a terrorist's hard drive.

The challenge is part of a series of online competitions based on fictional threats, designed to find the best technical minds in the country.

As part of the latest challenge, called Assignment Flag Drive, entrants must use computer skills and logic to break into the suspicious hardware and discover who the drive belongs to.

Assignment Flag Drive is the second in a series of challenges set up by Cyber Security Challenge UK. 

The fictional terrorist group is called The Flag Day Associates.

The group first appeared in a challenge in March, via a threat video, featuring three masked terrorists warning of a future cyber attack on the UK.

In June, more than 1,000 amateur cyber defenders signed up to help decipher the first clue - a suspicious email identified by the National Crime Agency. 

This email was intercepted and traced to an abandoned warehouse.

When the authorities searched the warehouse, they found an encrypted hard drive.

Challengers must use technical skills to break into the drive and discover as much about its owner as possible.

Challengers can register between 1 and 14 August at the Cyber Security Challenge UK website.

Once registration closes they will be sent a letter containing further details, and a URL to access the game.

The challenge officially starts at  9am BST on 15 August, and ends at midnight on 16 August.

It is only open to amateur security enthusiasts based in the UK.  

Assignment Flag Drive is the second in the series of challenges set up by Cyber Security Challenge UK and sponsored by Oxford-based security firm Sophos.

The fictional terrorist group is called The Flag Day Associates.

The group first appeared in a challenge in March, in a threat video featuring three masked terrorists warning of a future cyber attack on the UK.

The video was uploaded to YouTube and further 'secret' details were embedded in the video that revealed a possible date for the cyber attack.

In June, more than 1,000 amateur cyber defenders signed up to help decipher the first clue in a fictional investigation of the Flags - a suspicious email identified by the National Crime Agency believed to have been sent by a splinter group.

This email was intercepted and traced to an abandoned warehouse in the English countryside.

When the authorities arrived at the warehouse, the previous occupants had left, taking all their equipment with them apart from an encrypted hard drive.

Details about the drive will be placed online and challengers must try to hack into it. 

Would-be defenders can register between 1 and 14 August at the Cyber Security Challenge UK website.

‘This competition is going to be a lot of fun and include many of the key skills security professionals need in the workplace,’ explains James Lyne, global head of security research at Sophos.

‘It will have forensic and offensive aspects to it and be accessible to all levels.

‘Best of all is part of the game involves a collection of interesting Internet of Things devices. I’m looking forward to seeing the creative approaches the players take to overcoming the Associates’ 

The highest ranking entrants from the competition will automatically qualify for the first of a series of reconnaissance meet-ups as part of Operation Flag Day.

At these events, the most impressive candidates from the virtual assignments will be asked to report for duty in person at secret locations around the UK to carry out investigations face-to-face.

As well as uncovering vital clues on the objectives and identities of the Flag Day Associates, these will determine the final line up of online defenders to take on the Flag Day Associates at the Masterclass final next year.
