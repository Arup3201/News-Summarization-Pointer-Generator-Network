Convicted terrorists will soon be banned from speaking and writing letters in Arabic during visits and phone calls at one of Australia's highest-security prisons.

Under tough new restrictions, 13 prisoners, who are classified as 'Extreme High Risk Restricted' at SuperMax, the compound located within Goulburn jail in NSW, will only be allowed to speak English.

State Attorney General Brad Hazzard has called on the laws to take place in a bid to stop radicalisation of Muslim inmates from converting other prisoners, The Sunday Telegraph reports.

The law pledges to have prison officers strictly monitor conversations between inmates and visitors as well as refuse or terminate visits if Arabic or any other languages are used.

It comes after the Australian Federal Police revealed the terror alert for police had been raised to 'high' in the wake of terror plotting attacks and anti-terrorism raids across the country.

Last September, it was revealed that inmates were able to plot acts of terror from behind bars because they were allowed to write letters, make phone calls and have visits.

'One of the issues that came out of that process was that some of these people, these high-risk ­inmates, were conducting their ­discussions in Arabic, or at least not English,' Mr Hazzard said.

But in rare cases, Mr Hazzard said inmates will be allowed to speak another language when their 90-year-old grandmother visits for instance but an immediate translator must be supplied.

'We don't want to create a situation where they feel there's no sense of humanity, because there will be,' Mr Hazzard said.

'But they have to understand the people they're visiting have put our community at risk. There has to be some clear boundaries and rules.'

Among the 13 prisoners facing the ban will include Omarjan Azari, 22 who allegedly planned a plot to kill a random member of the public in the streets of Sydney.

Mohammad Kiad, 25, and Omar al-Kutobi, 24, are also behind bars at SuperMaz after they were both charged with terrorism offences.

The initiative was prompted when prison officers started noticing a rise of inmates converting to Islam, after switching their diet preferences from Western meals to halal, Sunday Telegraph reports.

Meanwhile, four 'young, white males' have lodged an application to have their diets changed at the Long Bay Correctional Complex at Malabar in Sydney on Monday.

It's reported that Bassam Hamzy, who was sentenced to life in jail for a 2002 murder and ran the 'Brothers 4 Life' gang, is the first to be banned from speaking Arabic.

The strict laws follows as prison authorities have banned Islamic prayer meetings in some of Sydney's jails after intelligence found some key jihadist figures were operating from behind bars.

But Mr Hazzard added that he has called on the department to recruit imams to lead prayer sessions with 'moderation and decency' as it reveals prayer sessions will now be held in English.
