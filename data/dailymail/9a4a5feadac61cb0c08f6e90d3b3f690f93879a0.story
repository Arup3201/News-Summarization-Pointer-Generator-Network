A couple who made history as the first to undergo in vitro fertilization (IVF) on live television 20 weeks ago, have announced that they are expecting a girl.

Jessica Menkhausen and Derek Manion from St Peters, Missouri, were once again filmed by the Today show as they waited for an ultrasound to confirm the sex of their baby.

Before the scan Ms Menkhausen, 33, said she had been 'hoping for a boy from the 
beginning' but afterwards she appeared overjoyed at the prospect of having a daughter.

'The most important thing is [that the baby 
is] healthy, so God gave us what he wanted us to have and daddy's little
 girl,' she exclaimed.

The expectant mother had picked out the name Pierce Nathaniel for a boy, but is now planning to christen her newborn Chloe Lee.

'We're just so ecstatic, so overwhelmed with joy,' she added.

If all goes as planned, Chloe will arrive in June.

The couple were last filmed in November as they waited for their first ultrasound to confirm news of a healthy pregnancy.

'Well that's the heart right there,' a doctor explained during a clip of the event, 'and as I scan through I'm seeing . . . one sac with a really good heartbeat.'

Ms Menkhausen had originally expressed a desire for twins but said when she saw the scan: 'I'm happy that there's just one.'

Writing about the event afterwards she continued: 'We got to see our baby’s glorious heart beating!

'Being able to actually see our little bundle of joy was an indescribably wonderful feeling.'

She said friends and family have jokingly tried to console her 
by reminding her one baby means 'half the diaper expense, half the clothes
 expense, and half the formula expense.'

Dr.
 Sherman Silber, director of the Infertility Center of St. Louis, has 
been with the couple every step of the way through their IVF experience.

Ms Menkhausen said in her first trimester she has been feeling 'extremely tired, more exhausted than I’ve ever felt.'

'For almost eight years now I have been used to a hectic 60-hour work week schedule, whether it was working full-time and going to school at night, or working full-time during the day and teaching part-time at night.

'I used to hate taking naps because I felt like I was wasting time, but now I look forward to my three to four naps every Saturday and Sunday.'

She says that her appetite has also increased and if she doesn't eat every few hours she gets headaches.

The Today show started following her on September 24 2013 when eggs were harvested from her ovaries.

Road to motherhood: Dr Sherman Silber shows exactly where he placed the embryos

NBC's
 Dr. Nancy Snyderman said from inside the operating room: 'Right now Dr 
Sherman Silber is inserting a micro needle with a little suction into 
the ovary and each of these black sacks you see really houses an egg. 
They're being sucked out and being examined behind us.'

Viewers were then told how Ms Menkhausen's eggs would be 
transported to the laboratory where her fiance's sperm would be 
injected into them to start the fertilization process.

Three days later, three 'good embryos' were transferred back into Ms Menkhausen's uterus.

Pre-surgery, Ms Menkhausen said that 
she wanted to share her journey through fertility treatment to 
'enlighten other women who are having the same challenges.'

'It’s also a form of self-enlightenment - sharing my story is helping me deal with some of my own fears, by courageously facing them head on.'

She
 had battled fertility issues since a teenager. Every month she would 
experience 'excruciating' menstrual cramps and went on to suffer
 two ectopic pregnancies in her twenties.

'It took years to get over,' she said. 'I was really glad when we met Dr Silber, he gave us so much hope.'

To
 pay for the procedure, which can cost up to $17,000 per cycle, she and 
Mr Manion were forced to postpone their wedding plans.
