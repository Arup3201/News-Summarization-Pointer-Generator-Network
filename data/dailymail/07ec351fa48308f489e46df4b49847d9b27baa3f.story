Two special dogs who were abandoned as pups formed a close friendship when they were both rescued by a dog shelter, and now the two have been adopted out together to a new 'forever home'.

Eve, a Catahoula Leopard Dog mix, was found by a Bear Valley mail carrier as a nine-week-old puppy nearly frozen in a snow drift on Christmas Eve.

Dillon is a two-year-old Border Collie cross who was dropped off at a dog boarding kennel - and never picked up again.

Complementary: Eve can't see and Dillon can't hear, but together they're unbeatable

Pound puppies: Eve and Dillon became inseparable when they met at Marley's Mutts

Eve is deaf and missing one eye; Dillon is completely blind.

Staff at the Marley's Mutts, where the two both ended up, were worried their disabilities would mean they wouldn't be able to socialize together, but were amazed when the opposite happened.

'I thought their disabilities would separate them, but from the beginning they just clicked,' Josh Skow told ABC 23.

The pair became inseparable, and their abilities served to help each other, rather than their disabilities hampering them.

According to HuffPost, Eve's disabilities made it difficult for her to interact with other dogs, and she was constantly chasing shadows due to her inhibited senses.

Overjoyed: Marley's Mutts staff were delighted the two dogs were going to be adopted together

'Dillon and Eve are the perfect compliment [sic] for one another, and 
essentially watch/lookout for each other.. Each has never been more at 
ease than when they are together. We walk off leash and she leads him. 
His acute hearing helps her feel more comfortable about her inability to
hear. Yin and Yang they are!' says the Marley's Mutts Facebook page.

The staff at Marley's Mutts were hoping against hope that the pair would be adopted together, but they were not optimistic that they would find anyone willing to take on not one but two large, disabled dogs.

Settling in: Eve and Dillon are getting used to their new home together

Eve had returned to Marley's Mutts shelter after an unsuccessful adoption due to the extra problems that arise from her disabilities, while Dillon arrived at the shelter last month.

Marley's Mutts is active on Facebook and other social media and posted about the two dogs' plights, getting their network of 'Mutt Militia' to help.

Shelley Scudder happened to see the posts and found herself unable to stop thinking about Eve.

'A co-worker of mine showed me a picture of Eve and by the fourth day I said "OK, I've got to meet this dog."'

Smiles: These two disabled dogs are happier than they've ever been since they met each other

Home wanted: Some of Eve and Dillon's friends still needing a home

When she arrived to meet Eve, she quickly discovered she came in a pair, but with four dogs, a fiance, an 11-year-old and a new home, Scudder was unsure if she could handle two more dogs.

After witnessing the special relationship between the two dogs, though, she couldn't say no.

'The home they are in is quite honestly perfect, and the two even have an 11-year-old human that they have added to their gang!' Skow told HuffPost.

The pair, who look remarkably similar, faced a grim future had they not been adopted.
