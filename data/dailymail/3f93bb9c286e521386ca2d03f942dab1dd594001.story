A family's pet pony was found mutilated with its eyes gouged out in a horrific attack which mirrors another horse killing which took place just days later.

Barney the pony was found butchered in a field when his owner went to feed him last Thursday night.

Both of his eyes had been gouged out, his stomach slit open, an ear cut off and his genitals removed.

In a bizarre twist, police believe Barney's killer came back the following night and carried out further mutilations on the pony.

Barney's owner, 64-year-old Linda Vickerage, was unable to move his body straight away and left his corpse in the field where he was found.

However, the killer is thought to have returned on Friday night to butcher him again. It is unclear which injuries were inflicted during the initial attack and which were carried out in the second.

Security was hired to guard the pony's corpse on the third night before he was taken away for disposal.

The sickening attack bears similar 
hallmarks to another horse mutilation in Cornwall on Sunday, in which a 
two-and-a-half-year-old stallion was found with its genitalia removed, 
an eye cut out and teeth pulled out.

Police believe the other horse - called Eric owned by Dawn Jewell - had been sedated before he was mutilated.

Ms Vickerage's 38-year-old daughter Nicola is now offering a £3,000 reward for information about the attack on Barney, which happened on her mother's smallholding in Whitland, West Wales.

Linda Vickerage found the seven-year-old pony 'horribly mutilated' when she went to feed him.

She said: 'When I came home in the 
evening I thought there was something wrong. I went to the field with 
the torch, and to my horror I could clearly see he was dead.

'I shined the torch on his face, his eyes had been pulled out and there was blood pouring from his abdomen.

'You can see a knife has been deliberately used to open his guts, it’s done with almost surgical precision.'

Linda took photographs of the mutilated carcass but they are too graphic to be published.

She
added: 'He was a lovely little pony - very gentle and friendly. I had 
him from a foal and he would run across the field to me for his feed 
every day.

'How anyone could
attack a poor, defenceless animal like Barney, I’ll never know.'

Dyfed 
Powys Police said an investigation had been launched and inquiries were 
ongoing.
