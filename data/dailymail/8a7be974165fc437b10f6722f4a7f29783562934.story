Game Of Thrones heart-throb Kit Harington – who plays raven-haired Jon Snow – has given up bread in his quest to stay in shape.

It’s the latest chapter in his diet saga after he piled on two stone for new film Pompeii, then found he had put on too much weight.

He had been eating 4,000 calories a day after being told to bulk up.

Too bulky, knows nothing: Kit Harrington, who plays Jon Snow on Game of Thrones and Milo in Pompeii, ate 4,000 calories a day to gain muscle for the film, but was told he had gotten 'too big'

But when he arrived for filming looking  ‘big and muscly’, he was advised he actually needed to be leaner.

It meant Kit, 27, had to starve himself while working out intensely for the required look.

He’s now trying to get back to his old shape – and has cut out bread completely.

‘You’ve got to do these things to stay slim to be an actor,’ he says.

‘But it’s also better for my body – my digestion, my energy levels and my fitness.’

Hypnotherapy is being used to tackle the chest pain felt in  so-called cardiac syndrome X.

Sufferers
 – mostly women – experience an intense crushing pain in their chest, 
similar to angina or heart attack.

But tests find no obvious cause and 
drugs fail to stop the debilitating symptoms, leaving patients with 
frequent hospital visits, increased psychological illness and poor 
quality of life.

‘I see 16 
to 20 patients a week with cardiac syndrome X in my heart clinic and 
across the country many go unmanaged,’ says Professor Peter Collins, 
consultant cardiologist at Royal Brompton Hospital, where a clinical 
trial of hypnotherapy is under way.

It follows a pilot study showing that the treatment helped patients  who had suffered chest pain for  up to 14 years.

The
 cause of cardiac syndrome X is not fully understood, though scanning 
research has suggested tiny vessels carrying blood to the heart fail to 
open properly, while other theories include changing oestrogen levels 
and acid reflux.

Almost three-quarters of sufferers have an anxiety 
problem.

Hypnotherapy has previously been found to help anxiety and irritable bowel syndrome.

Playing Scrabble with a romantic partner can significantly lower nicotine cravings while trying to quit smoking.

A study of 20 couples, in which at least one partner was trying to give up smoking and suffering nicotine withdrawal, used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to scan participants’  brains while they played a series of different games.

During the games that were most 
mentally challenging, the participants were found to  have decreased 
cravings for nicotine, according to the study at Idaho State University.

The researchers, whose
 findings were published in the journal PLOS One, believe that more 
exciting games activate the major reward zone in the brain, lowering the
 craving.

Blueberries could help treat Parkinson’s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders, says a study.

Fruit
 flies engineered to have the gene associated with Parkinson’s lived  
eight days longer– equal  to eight human years – when given a blueberry 
extract by researchers at Memorial University in Newfoundland, Canada.

One
 in 500 Britons has Parkinson’s, the main symptoms of which are tremor, 
rigidity and slow movement, and there is currently no cure.

Although
 nobody knows the exact cause of the disease, research  indicates that 
the  alpha-synuclein gene is  involved as it regulates dopamine, a 
brain  chemical involved in motor control that is lacking in Parkinson’s
 sufferers.

Blueberries are already known as a superfood  for their nutritional benefits.
