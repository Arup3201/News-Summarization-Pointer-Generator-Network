British airman dropped copies of the plan for a post-war welfare state on Nazi German to demoralise the population in an audacious propaganda exercise.

Copies of the 1942 Beveridge Report were translated into German and flown by RAF bombers to Berlin and jettisoned over the city.

A new book by authors John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldrige uncovers the secret war-time story of how the RAF dropped leaflets instead of bombs.

Copies of the Beveridge Report were translated into 22 languages - including German - and dropped on Occupied Europe by the RAF

Propaganda was an important tool during the war with 6,000,000 leaflets dropped on Germany during the first week of the conflict blaming Hitler on the outbreak of hostilities

During the first week of the conflict, RAF crews dropped an estimated six million leaflets over Germany blaming Adolf Hitler for the hostilities.

Now, according to The Fourth Revolution: The Global Race to Reinvent the State, copies of Beveridge's 1942 report were found in Hitler's Berlin bunker after the fall of Nazi Germany.

William Beveridge presented his radical reform to Westminster in November 1942 to outline his vision for a post-war Britain. 

He identified the five key 'giant evils' that plagued society as 'disease, want, ignorance, squalor and idleness'.

The main aim of the report was the 'abolition of want' and called for the introduction of a social insurance scheme. 

He said the end of the war could allow a radical restructure of society. 

Beveridge's report was used by the 1945 Labour Government as the template for the NHS which introduced comprehensive healthcare 'from the cradle to the grave'. 

Universal benefits were also introduced as a result of the Beveridge Report

According to the book's authors, the Beveridge Report had been translated into 22 different languages.

They claim that the document sold 100,000 copies within a month of its publication - with 50,000 copies purchased in the United States.

In total, the report has sold an estimated 600,000 copies.

According to the book's authors the first major revolution came in the 16th and 17th centuries with the development of  powerful nation states in Europe. 

The second revolution was during the 18th and 19th century with the Victorians reducing corruption and cronyism.

Micklethwait and Wooldridge argue that the creation of the welfare state after the Second World War announced the creation of a third revolution.

It is believed that the Beveridge Report was studied by German economists who accepted that its proposals were very comprehensive.

According to the book, Nazi officials decided that they would not give any publicity to the Beveridge Report, even though one suggested 'our enemies are taking over national socialist ideas'. 

The Nazis accepted the Beveridge Report was 'superior to the current German social insurance in almost all points'.

Now, the authors claim the world is facing a fourth revolution, which is being led countries like China and Singapore who are 'making the greatest strides in genuine innovation'.

Leaflets and reports were not the only things propaganda devices dropped by allied aircrew during the conflict.

In the Far East, forged banknotes were dropped in Malaysia to undermine Japanese rule.
