A jury has been sworn in for the trial of artist and entertainer Rolf Harris, who is accused of a string of indecent assaults.

The 84-year-old appeared at London’s Southwark Crown Court today, accompanied by his wife Alwen, who looked on from the public gallery with other family members as he sat in the glass-walled dock.

Wearing a grey suit and a pink shirt with blue stripes, and a red and black tie, Harris, from Bray in Berkshire, listened to proceedings through a hearing loop.

A panel of 12, made up of six men and six women, along with three extras, two men and one woman, were chosen from a pool of more than 20 potential members.

Harris stood at the front of the dock as the process took place, and the indictment was read out.Mr Justice Sweeney told the jurors: 'I am the judge of the law, likewise you are the judges of the facts.

'As judge of the law, I have various duties to manage the conduct of the trial, to see fair play and to rule, typically in your absence, on any legal argument and in due course to sum the case up to you, directing you on the law that you will have to apply.

Count 1 - indecent assault of a girl aged seven or eight on an occasion between January 1968 and January 1970

Count 2 - the same offence on a girl aged 14 between January 1975 and January 1976

Counts 3 and 4 - the same offence on a girl aged 12 to 15 between December 1978 and April 1981

Count 5 - indecent assault of a girl aged 14 to 15 between the same dates

Counts 6 to 8 - indecent assault of a girl aged 12 to 15 between the same dates

Count 9 - the same offence on a girl aged 19 between January 1984 and January 1985

Counts 10 to 12 - the same offence on a girl aged 14 on May 31 1986

The former television presenter denies all the counts.

'As judges of the facts, your duty, pooling your common sense and experience of life, is to assess the witnesses and the other evidence that is put before you in the trial, and in due course to decide the relevant facts and thereby, having applied my directions of law, to reach a verdict according to the evidence.

'A number of duties follow from your role as judges of the facts. It's your duty to try the case on the evidence. The evidence is the evidence that you hear in this courtroom and nothing else.'

He said jurors have duties, including not allowing themselves to be influenced 'by any external matter', including media coverage.

They should not discuss the case with anyone else, should not post entries on social networking sites about the trial, and should not try to research the case themselves.

Harris is accused of 12 counts of indecent assault on four alleged victims, the youngest of whom was seven or eight and the oldest 19, between 1968 and 1986, which he denies.

The clerk of the court read the indictment to the jury, going through the 12 counts as Harris stood in the dock.

Mr Justice Sweeney told the three extra jurors that they will sit in court for the beginning of the trial in case any issues arise with the 12 who were sworn in.

He said: 'Sometimes in a case of some size, like this one, during the course of the prosecution opening of the case when the detail is gone through more with the jury, a juror can sometimes realise that they know someone who is mentioned or that something else has arisen that really means they should not be sitting on the jury.

'Because it is so strongly preferable that the trial should have 12 jurors rather than any lesser number, that almost inevitably means that the whole jury has to be discharged before the whole thing starts again.

If you do not have spare jurors... that would mean that you would need to go through the whole process that you've gone through over the past few days again; obviously that would be an unfortunate waste of time and money. The spare jurors are here in case that happens.'

The jurors were sent away until tomorrow, when it is expected that the prosecution case will open.
