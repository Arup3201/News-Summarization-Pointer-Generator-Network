Hundreds of protesters angered at the killing of unarmed black men by white police officers again marched through downtown Berkeley streets on Tuesday night as protests continued to rage in Northern California.

Disturbing footage has emerged showing one man, believed to be a Berkeley doctor, knocked out cold after another man hit him in the head with a hammer. 

The man, who was trying to stop demonstrators from smashing up a Radio Shack, can be seen fighting with the other man in the footage before he is hit.

He was rushed to Highland Hospital.

However the attack caused the violence to escalate in the town, according to Berkeleyside.

Protest: Demonstrators in Berkeley blocked traffic on I-80 for over an hour on Monday night

Demonstrators stopped at City Hall, where a city councilman addressed the crowd and said he will ask for an investigation into police response to the protests over the weekend, when the latest wave of protests started.

Bay Area Rapid Transit officials said the station in downtown Berkeley was closed as a precaution. A City Council meeting scheduled for Tuesday night was canceled after threats to disrupt it, said Berkeley Mayor Tom Bates.

One man, a doctor from Berkeley, was hit in the head with a hammer while trying to stop looters from smashing into a Radio Shack.

A California Highway Patrol official said 80 percent off its available staff would be deployed to monitor the protest in Berkeley after a crowd of about 1,500 blocked all lanes of Interstate 80 and blocked an Amtrak train Monday night.

The agency arrested 223 people Monday on suspicion of resisting arrest, obstructing police and other charges, said Ernie Sanchez, assistant chief of the CHP's Golden Gate Division. Berkeley police arrested another nine people.

Sanchez told the San Francisco Chronicle the agency will also ask the Alameda County district attorney's office to increase bails and charges.

Those arrested face bails of up to $50,000, and many remain in custody, he added.

Bold statement: Hundreds of people marched through downtown Berkeley Monday in reaction to the grand jury decisions not to indict white police officers in the deaths of two unarmed black men

A large group of demonstrators destroyed highway perimeter fencing, flooded lanes, and threw rocks and other objects at officers. 

It took about an hour and a half to clear the interstate, and no major injuries were reported, the CHP reported.

A woman stuck in traffic went into labor during the protest, but fire crews were able to get her to a hospital, KPIX-TV reported.

'The CHP respects the public's right to gather and demonstrate, but it needs to be done in a safe manner,' Sanchez said.

'At this point, they've made their statement and we respect that. 

'Now, we're asking them to stop.'

Although many activists in other parts of the country have gone home, protests in Berkeley and Oakland are still active, reflecting the area's long history of protest dating to the 1960s.

The protests started after a grand jury on Nov. 24 declined to indict Officer Darren Wilson in the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. 

A New York grand jury on Dec. 3 declined to prosecute a police officer captured on video applying a fatal chokehold on Eric Garner. 

That decision set off more demonstrations nationwide.

The California Highway Patrol also deployed tear gas against protesters on Sunday after explosives were thrown at them.

Tear gas was also used against the protesters on Saturday, which Berkeley Mayor Tom Bates admits may have been an overreaction.

Police kept a noticeably wider distance on Sunday, but that only led to more businesses getting vandalized.

On Monday, many business owners closed early and boarded up in preparation for the march, and nearby UC Berkeley sent out an email to staff suggesting they leave campus by 4:30pm.

'It was really disturbing,' Bates said of the weekend protests, as reported by ABC 7. 'It turned violent and it turned violent in a way that we haven't seen here for a long, long time. Over the weekend, over 16 various stores were trashed, not just major businesses, but small businesses.'

Berkeley has a history of civil disobedience, as one of the focal point for protests against the Vietnam War in the 1960s and 1970s.

Because of this history, local police are not allowed to have search dogs, stun guns or helicopters.

'The people in the Bay Area are sensitive to worldwide issues,' Bates said, according to NBC Bay Area. 'Unfortunately, there is a small element that uses violence at times to make their point.'
