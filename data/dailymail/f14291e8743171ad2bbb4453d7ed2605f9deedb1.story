Beatles guide Paul Beesley said: 'This is an important house because it's where Paul spent his formative schoolboy years.

'He was exposed to music from an early age and his dad had a jazz band. Paul's first instrument was the trumpet.'

The house went under the hammer in the city's Cavern Club last night and sold for more than double the average price for a property on the same road.

The buyer of the property, who did not want to be named, said he was 'delighted' to have won against competition from overseas bidders.

Stephen Giddins, regional sales director of estate agent Entwistle Green, said: 'We are delighted for our client as we were consciously aware that there was a lot of interest in the property.

'We wanted to ensure that this translated into achieving the best price possible for them.'.
