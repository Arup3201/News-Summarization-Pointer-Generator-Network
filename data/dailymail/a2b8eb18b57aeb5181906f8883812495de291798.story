This picture shows a nine-year-old boy happily posing for a holiday snap next to Jimmy Savile’s Rolls-Royce - just hours before the child alleges the disgraced TV star abused him.

Members of the boy’s family took the photograph of him by the iconic luxury motor while on holiday in Southsea, Hampshire, unaware that the occasion would go on to haunt the youngster for years.

It’s believed Savile was in the area for a charity event in aid of disabled sports people when he allegedly preyed on the child in 1972.

Lawyers representing the alleged 
victim, who is now middle-aged, have released the picture in a bid to 
jog people’s memories as they seek more information.

The
alleged victim has reported the incident to a police force in the north
east and is putting together a statement for the Metropolitan Police.

He was aged about nine at the time and his face has been blurred as he cannot be identified for legal reasons.

Solicitor Alan Collins specialises in child abuse cases for Pannone Solicitors, the legal firm representing the man.

Mr Collins said: 'We want to know more about what this event in Southsea was. The victim remembers it being a charity event for disabled sports people.

The estate of Jimmy Savile has been frozen in response to the mounting sexual abuse claims against the late television and radio star.

NatWest Bank, which is acting as the Jim'll Fix It presenter's will executor and trustee, said the distribution of his assets had been put on hold because of the allegations.

Savile's estate is reportedly worth £4.3 million.

NatWest said in a statement: 'Given the claims raised, distribution of the estate has been put on hold.'

Savile's will was written in 2006 and bequeaths his savings and other assets to 26 separate beneficiaries, according to the Financial Times.

The newspaper said it had obtained a copy of the document which instructs that £20,000 in cash was to be shared between 20 of the celebrity's friends, family and neighbours.

It says a further £600,000 was to be put into a trust fund, with the interest shared between eight people.

The remainder - just under £3.7 million before expenses - was to be held by NatWest on behalf of The Jimmy Savile Charitable Trust.

'We want to know specifically if Savile was the guest of honour and who was involved in arranging his visit.

'An organiser wouldn’t get into trouble because they may not be the person or organisation who employed Mr Savile.'

He is being assessed by a psychiatrist before Pannone decides how much compensation to seek from Savile’s estate.

Mr Collins said: 'It appears Mr Savile was able to have direct access with young people and do terrible things to them.

'This is a typical child abuse case and the victim has for many years been able to suppress what happened to him.

'Now with all the attention surrounding Mr Savile the memories have come back.'

Pannone is following up other lines 
of inquiry from victims across the country, after reports that more than
200 people say Savile abused them.

It comes as Savile's niece today told how she 'cried for a week' after hearing accusations that her uncle had abused hundreds of girls.

Pam
Ward, from Edinburgh, said that their family will 'never get over' the 
allegations of sex abuse carried out by the former Top of the Pops 
presenter.

Mrs Ward, 66, said she was in a state
of 'disbelief' when she first heard what the 'kind and charismatic' 
uncle she knew was accused of doing.

The married mum of four said she is 
ashamed of her uncle's alleged actions, and she has no idea what she 
would say to the victims.

Speaking to an Edinburgh evening paper she said: 'It was disbelief at first. It’s like I’ve lived a sheltered life and never known any of these things were going on.

'The first week, well I practically spent the first week crying. I’ve been sent lots of flowers, had phone calls and cards, with people offering support.

'It’s nothing to do with me, but in a sense I feel ashamed. I’m sure it’s the same with the rest of the family, although I wouldn’t like to speak for them.

'Everyone has been talking about all the awful stuff. The good work he committed himself to all his life has been quickly forgotten.

'What can I say, what would you say to the victims if it was your relative?'

Mrs Ward was 43 when she discovered that Savile was her long-lost uncle.

Adopted at 18 months, she waited until her adoptive parents had died before starting to search for her birth parents. It was then she discovered her father was Jimmy’s older brother, John Henry Savile.

Mrs Ward had cut ties with her father in the years before his death in 1998, but said she was completely unaware of the allegations until they were reported in a Sunday newspaper on October 14.

The walls of her home remain decorated with several of her uncle Jimmy’s pictures, which Mrs Ward has felt unable to take down.

She added: 'Hopefully in years to come they will look back at some of the good work he did, but I understand it’s pretty unlikely.'
