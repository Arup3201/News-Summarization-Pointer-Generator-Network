Another sergeant at one of the busiest military training bases in the U.S. is on trial with a witness testifying yesterday that he forced recruits in their first hour of training to fill their canteens with toilet water and drink it.

These are the latest in a long line of accusations against Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas, which has already been rocked after the discovery of widespread rape and abuse dating back to 2008. 

An evidentiary hearing continues 
today for Staff Sgt Ryan Deraas who has already been accused of having inappropriate relationships with the female recruits.

Accused: An evidentiary hearing continues 
today for Staff Sgt Ryan Deraas who has already been accused of having inappropriate relationships with the recruits.

Crimes: Six male instructors at the Lackland Air Force base, pictured, have been charged in the last year with crimes ranging from rape to adultery while more are under investigation

He could face court-martial on two 
charges and eight specifications of wrongdoing at the base.

The San Antonio Express-News reports 
Airman 1st Class Cody Zecchin testified on Monday that Deraas in 2010 
told him and other recruits to fill their canteens with water.

Zecchin says Deraas told him and four others to fill theirs from the toilet which he said he did after seeing Deraas push another trainee toward the bathroom stall.

Change of leadership: Col. Deborah Liddick, pictured, has been chosen to lead the basic training unit at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas

Yesterday, four female airmen 
testified that Deraas found them on Facebook and pursued sexual 
relationships with them, 'sexting' and sending photos of himself on his 
cell phone.

Like the 
dozen or so other instructors taken to court so far, Deraas is charged 
with pursuing unprofessional relationships with female trainees.

He is the first to be charged with 
maltreatment of his trainees. He could get up to 12 years in prison if 
convicted of all charges.

A woman identified only as airman three broke down in tears yesterday as she recalled what Deraas would say to her.

'He would say he was working in (charge of quarters), he would text me and say he was bored and say, "I'm horny".'

Another
woman said Deraas called her attractive and that they agreed to meet at
a dance hall while she was in technical training at Lackland, according
to My San Antonio.

They
went to his home that night and began a relationship that lasted until 
she left for her first duty station, spending weekends in his apartment 
having sex and watching television.

Deraas
is the ninth boot camp instructor at Lackland to be charged in a sex 
scandal. So far 25 trainers have come under investigation for incidents 
going back to 2008.

The Air Force has identified 49 women as victims.

Due to the revelations, the U.S. Air Force chose a woman to lead its basic training unit at the base.

U.S. Air Force Base: Lackland is where every new American airman reports for basic training, graduating about 35,000 each year

Dismissed: Air Force Staff Sgt Luis Walker, right, arrives at his trial in July, accused of sexually assaulting ten basic trainees, with charges ranging from rape and aggravated sexual assault to obstructing justice and violating rules of professional conduct

Col. Deborah Liddick’s command of the 737th Training Group brought a distinctly new face of authority to where a number of male instructors were charged with crimes ranging from rape to adultery.

Lackland is where every new American airman reports for basic training, graduating about 35,000 each year.

Replaced: U.S. Air Force Col. Glenn Palmer, pictured, was ousted last month from the position Liddick takes as attention to the scandal intensified

She takes over for Col Glenn Palmer, who was ousted earlier this year as attention to the scandal intensified.

Another commander at Lackland was also relieved over the summer for what military prosecutors described as a lack of confidence.

The most serious allegations at Lackland involved  Air Force Staff Sgt Luis Walker, sentenced to 20 years in prison in July after being convicted of raping one female recruit and sexually assaulting several others.

Walker, a married father with two 
boys, was found guilty on all 28 charges faced with prosecutors claiming
that he had sexual intercourse with four of ten female recruits.

He faced life in prison.

Earlier this week, Staff Sgt Kwinton Estacio was sentenced to a year in prison and received a dishonorable discharge after pleading guilty to having sex with a trainee. He faced up to 14 years in prison.

In early August, Tech Sgt Christopher
Smith, 33, was convicted on two of four counts of misconduct with basic
trainees and sentenced to 30 days in jail.

Among
his charges Smith was found by jurors having sought an intimate 
relationship with a teenager trainee but not guilty of making sexual 
advances to her.

He was also found guilty of a social relationship with a second trainee while innocent of a charge of obstruction of justice.

His rank has been reduced to Airman First Class, escaping the highest possible charge of a year in prison and full removal from the Air Force with a bad conduct discharge.

Protect Our Defenders, an advocacy group that has pressed Congress to hold hearing on the Lackland scandal, continued calling for legislative changes to military policies with news of Liddick's appointment.

'Hopefully, Col. Deborah Liddick will do a great job,' said Nancy Parrish, the group's president. She added that what's occurring at Lackland is part of 'a much broader problem endemic throughout all the services.'

U.S. Rep. Howard 'Buck' McKeon, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, visited Lackland last week and said he believed the Air Force was being diligent in its investigation. In August, the White House pick for Air Force chief of staff was held up while Congress pressed the service for answers about the scandal.
