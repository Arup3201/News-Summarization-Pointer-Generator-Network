Four U.S. soldiers have been charged in a home invasion that saw four people in an apartment shot and wounded.

Three from Fort Sill base broke into a home in Lawton, Oklahoma, last Tuesday - and the fourth was the getaway driver, prosecutors say.

The three who allegedly entered the home were Private Richard Daley, 24; Privates First Class Claude Byrd II, 27; and Kevon McLaren, 22.

They were each charged with conspiracy to commit first-degree robbery, three counts of first-degree robbery and five counts of kidnapping.

McLaren, who witnesses claim fired the shots, was also charged with shooting with intent to kill and first-degree burglary.

The alleged getaway driver was Private First Class Jared Berman, 20, and he is charged with being an accessory to a crime.

McLaren shot the four adult victims and - along with Daley and Byrd - stole several items from the apartment near their base, affidavits said.

The apartment is about 80 miles southwest of Oklahoma City and is where the post is located. All four soldiers were in jail on Wednesday.

'This was an isolated incident, well outside the norm in terms of the way our soldiers behave off-duty and especially in Lawton, where our 
various unit relationships and community support initiatives have 
showcased our soldiers as good neighbours'

Fort Sill commander Major General David Halverson said post officials are co-operating with the investigation.

‘This was an isolated incident, well outside the norm in terms of the way our soldiers behave off-duty,’ he said.

‘And especially in Lawton, where our various unit relationships and community support initiatives have showcased our soldiers as good neighbours.’

The four soldiers are assigned to the 75th Fires Brigade, which a Fort Sill spokesman described as a field and air defence artillery unit.
