British families could be facing a shortage of Brussels sprouts this Christmas after a period of wet weather in October left vegetables at the bottom of stalks wrecked.

A hot summer had actually produced larger than average sprouts - but mid-Autumn downpours meant much of the early crop stalks had to be cut due to water damage.

The news will cause concern among those hoping to cook the perfect Christmas dinner next week. 

Concern: British families could be facing a shortage of Christmas favourite Brussels sprouts

A memo by Morrisons trading director Andrew Garton read: 'Much of the early crop stalks had to be cut higher up the stem due to water damage,' The Sun reports.

'Farmers require a period of cold, dry weather to finish the sprouts and maintain a healthy appearance.'

Approximately 30 per cent of the Brussels sprout harvest appears on shop shelves in the ten days before Christmas. 

Morrisons has promised not to raise its prices as a result of the shortage - which is believed to have effected the whole industry.

And farmers are hoping for good weather in the lead up to Christmas so that families will not be disappointed on December 25.

Despite the shortage of sprouts, experts claim that good conditions in 2014 have seen other vegetables enjoy the best produce for years - meaning Christmas favourites such as parsnips, carrots and potatoes will be in plenty of supply.
