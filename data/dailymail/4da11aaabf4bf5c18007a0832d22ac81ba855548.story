Huey was found dumped in Moreno Valley in Los Angeles and was not expected to live.

Extremely emaciated and covered in bite wounds and other injuries, it's believed the pit bull had been used as bait to rev up other dogs in a dog fighting ring.

Pieces of his lip had been ripped off and there were gashes all over his mouth, which animal rescue workers believe had been taped shut so he couldn't fight back against attackers.

'He was a skeleton - I've never seen anything so appalling and disgusting,' Wendy James, one of the women who found Huey, told KTLA 5.

Shocking: Huey, aged about three, is believed to have suffered years of torment as bait for a dog fighting ring

Emaciated: The pit bull was painfully thin and terribly malnourished when he was found dumped

Close to death: The pit bull weighed just 33 pounds when he was found dumped in Moreno Valley

Treatment: Huey was taken in by Second Chance Rescue and then adopted by new owner Tracy Lystra

Huey was taken to Second Chance Rescue in Corona.

He weighed just 33 pounds. 

He was extremely malnourished and weak, with infected ears.

He tested positive for parasites and his jaw had been mangled beyond repair, likely from multiple former breaks that had not been properly treated.

That was three weeks ago, and Huey has now been adopted by Tracy Lystra, who is not only seeing him back to good health but starting a campaign to stop dog fighting.

'For the first 12 hours I had Huey, he vomited so much and experienced such diarrhea that I thought he would surely pass away during the night,' Lystra wrote on her Give Forward fundraising page.

'I slept beside him and encouraged him to keep fighting.'

On-the-mend: Though he wasn't meant to survive and is still recovering, Huey continues to get better

But Huey soldiered through and is now recovering well, even though he has a long way to go. 

'His wounds are healing inside and outside,' Lystra told KTLA. 

'He has dreams, he shakes, he cries, he whimpers.

'To me he is a miracle.'

Lystra has set up a Saving Huey Facebook page, where people can follow his progress.

She is also using the page to post information about the horrors of dog fighting to better educate people .

'We want to get out there and help all the little Hueys,' she said.

'I think he can touch a lot of lives.'

The Give Forward account has so far raised $1,325 for Huey's vet expenses.
