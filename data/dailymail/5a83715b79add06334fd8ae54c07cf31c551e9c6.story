An adorable toddler is stealing hearts on the internet after a video showing her performing a traditional Tahitian dance went viral. 

Filmed in a dance studio the 22-month-old girl named Vaihere can be seen swinging her hips while dancing along to a drum beat.

Striking poses in between her movements, the young girl stays focused as she parades around the room moving left to right.

A video featuring the adorable dancing toddler, named Vaihere, has gone viral on the internet

Dancing entirely on her own she shows  signs of nervousness as she approaches those sitting watching her.

But the young girl then dances like no one is watching as she pirouettes with a hand in the air and shuffles back off in the other direction.

Performing at a studio, Vaihere is said to love dancing and always looks forward to practising her moves.

Tahitian is a traditional style of dance that features rapid hip shaking movements accompanied by percussion music.

The footage was captured by the toddler’s aunt at a Polynesian dance school in Tamuning, Guam, late last month.

Her aunt wrote online: 'She loves to dance and always looks forward to practice at the studio.'
