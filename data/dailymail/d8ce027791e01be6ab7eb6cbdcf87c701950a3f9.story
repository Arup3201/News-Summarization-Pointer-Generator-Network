Emergency powers are to be introduced to stamp out an invasion of killer Asian hornet.

Ministers fear the impact on public health if swift action is not taken to deal with swarms of the deadly insects arriving on British shores.

New species control orders will give the authorities power to wipeout animals, plants and pests which pose a threat to the health and security of the nation.

New Species Control Orders will be used to stamp out foreign invaders, including the Asian Hornet which has killed six people in France

Fears have been growing about the imminent arrival of the killer hornets, which can eat up to 50 honey bees each a day.

The come from China but have spread around the world and in France six people have died from anaphylactic shock after being stung.

Beekeepers have been enlisted to keep watch for the arrival of the insects, but the government fears existing powers are too limited to deal with an invasion when it happens.

The Infrastructure Bill, unveiled in today’s Queen’s Speech, includes details of a new battleplan to deal with invasive non-native species.

It will introduce new controls for when landowners, homeowners or business are unable or unwilling to act to deal with the arrival of species which threaten the country.

Special Control Orders will control ‘the invasive, non-native species that pose serious threats to biodiversity, the water environment and infrastructure’.

Details of the new control orders were included in the Infrastructure Bill, announced by the Queen in the House of Lords

The Chinese term for hornets is 'hu feng'.

Those behind the deadly attacks this summer appear to be the Asian giant hornet, or Vespa mandarinia.

The Asian giant hornet grows up to 5cm long with a 6mm sting  which injects a large amount of potent venom.

The hornet sting can be extremely painful to humans and has been compared to a hot nail being hammered into the body,

The head of the hornet is orange and quite wide in comparison to other hornet species.

The
 Asian giant hornet is intensely predatory; it hunts medium- to 
large-sized insects, such as bees, other hornet species, and mantises.

Hornets are most aggressive in behavior when they mate and migrate in September and October.

Attacks are difficult to prevent because hornet nests are usually in hidden sites.

The
 orders will be available to deal with any new, dangerous species but 
government sources suggested the Asian Hornet poses the greatest 
imminent threat.

It
 will not apply to existing problem species, like Japanese Knotweed, but
 act as a rapid response to deal with future threats before they take 
hold.

People who find the hornets are urged not to approach their nests but to contact the authorities.

Exterminators
 will be deployed to destroy their nests, normally found high in tees or
 in buildings, with chemicals or by burning them. 

The
 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said 'most, if not 
all' cases are dealt with voluntarily, but when speed is of the essence 
the new powers would enable swift action to be taken.

It
 is thought the new control orders would be used once a year, in an 
attempt to stop invasive species gaining a foothold in England.

It follows a call from a committee of MPs for urgent action to better protect England from foreign invaders. 

The Environmental Audit Committee said: ‘There is a clear need for species control agreements and species control orders to ensure effectiveness of rapid response plans to eradicate invasive species before they can become established. 

‘They could help avoid wasted effort and expenditure on large-scale control or eradication programmes, which might otherwise fail if access to all affected land could not be secured.’ 

It followed a warning from the Law Commission that the government should tighten the invasive species legislation for England and Wales as a top priority. 

The government said that the Infrastructure Bill would also clear the way for new roads, exploration of fracking and freeing up public land for homes. 

The changes will see the Highways Agency (HA) transformed into a Government-owned company. 

The Government reckons the move, covering England's motorways and major A-roads, will save taxpayers at least £2.6 billion over the next 10 years.

 However the Government is risking the ire of environmental campaigners and its own supporters with changes to laws to make it easier to frack under people's homes.
