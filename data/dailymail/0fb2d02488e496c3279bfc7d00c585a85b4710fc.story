David Cameron today pledges to protect a raft of pensioner benefits to ensure 'dignity and security in retirement'.

In a major pitch to grey voters, the Prime Minister will vow to continue paying for the winter fuel allowance, free bus passes, TV licences, prescriptions and eye tests for as long as he is in Downing Street.

He will repeat the pledge, which he first made at the last election, as he rejects the argument that such benefits are an 'unnecessary luxury' in times of financial difficulties.

Instead, he said it is 'our fundamental duty' to care for those who have 'done the right thing'.

They deserve 'comfort, independence, companionship, health' he said in a speech, adding: 'No one has put in as much as our elderly. These people have fought wars, seen us through recessions – made this the great country it is today.

'They brought us into the world and cared for us, and now it's our turn – our fundamental duty – to care for them.'

Last year Mr Cameron refused to say whether pensioner benefits would be continued for another five years, amid reports of opposition from within Cabinet.

It emerged at the time that senior ministers, including Iain Duncan Smith and George Osborne had both argued for the guarantee to be dropped.

Both Labour and the Lib Dems have called for restrictions on elements of some pensioner benefits for the better off.

In 2010, during the television debates, Mr Cameron rounded on Gordon Brown, accusing him of scaremongering by telling older people their benefits would be cut under the Tories.

Today he said: 'In 2010, I looked down the barrel of the camera and made a clear commitment to the British people that I would keep these things.

'And that wasn't a commitment for five years – it was a commitment for as long as I was Prime Minister.

'I know some people don't like this. There are those who say it's an unnecessary luxury during a time of national financial difficulties. They're wrong. Say that to the older woman who can keep warm tonight, on this cold February evening, because she's been given the money to heat her home.

'Or the widower heading into town on the bus, doing his shopping, seeing people for the only time that week. Or the bedbound lady whose whole day is brightened by the TV; or the sick man whose pain is kept at bay.

'Comfort, independence, companionship, health – these aren't luxuries; they're what people who have worked and saved all their lives deserve.

'And think what we would give up if we did take them away – the principle that if you've done the right thing you will get the benefits of living in Britain.'

Rejecting the argument that pensioner benefits need to be reduced to pay for cuts to the overall welfare bill, he will point out that the 'biggest saving' made by the Government has been as a result of raising the retirement age.

He will also hint that Labour, which has said it will cut winter fuel payments for richer pensioners, could go further and restrict the benefits 'far more aggressively' or even abolish them altogether. That suggestion will be furiously rejected by Labour.

The Winter Fuel Allowance costs around £2billion a year, the free TV licence for over-75s £600million, free bus passes £1billion and free prescriptions and eye tests £4billion.

Tory analysis suggests that Labour's policy of means-testing winter fuel payments will save just £75million after administration costs – or just 4 per cent of the budget for the benefit.

That compares to Labour's estimate of £105million a year.

In this Parliament the Lib Dems have refused to countenance any further welfare reform unless Mr Cameron agrees to cuts to benefits for the better off.

It is Lib Dem policy to remove winter fuel payments and TV licences from higher rate tax paying pensioners but continue the pensioner bus pass, free prescriptions or eye tests for all.

Lib Dem pensions minister Steve Webb said: 'The working age poor will pay the price for the Conservative ring fence for the very wealthiest pensioners.

'The Conservatives are proposing £12 billion pounds of welfare cuts which is the equivalent of a £1500 cut for eight million people. 

'By ruling out any changes to benefits of wealthy pensioners they are showing their determination to balance the books solely on the backs of disabled people and the working age poor.'

Mr Cameron pledged last year to keep the 'triple lock', which guarantees the value of the £113-a-week basic state pension, until at least 2020 if he wins the election.

Mr Cameron said: 'The truth is this: the big savings will only come by restricting these benefits far more aggressively – or by abolishing these benefits altogether.

'That's why I have to warn people – beware of politicians promising just to cut one or two of these benefits, and only by a bit. Once they have started chipping away at these benefits, believe me, before long, they'll start getting rid of them altogether.'

The announcement was welcomed by campaign groups representing older people.

Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said: 'Age UK supports the continuation of older people's universal benefits because they are the best way we have of getting extra help to those who need it, and because older people tell us they value them highly.'

Paul Green of Saga said: 'There appears to be much in today's announcement that will appeal to the Saga generations.' 

Rachel Reeves, Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary, said: 'David Cameron's government has let millions of pensioners down, failing to act on rising fuel costs and rip off pension fees and charges.

'Pensioners will find it hard to take pre-election promises seriously from a Prime Minister who has introduced the granny tax, increased VAT, and caused the Tory NHS crisis which has damaged social care services.

'Labour has a better plan for pensioners. We will support the triple lock, freeze energy bills and ensure savers are protected against pension rip-off pension charges and mis-selling. As part of our plan to get the deficit down in a fairer way, we will stop paying the winter fuel allowance to the richest five per cent of pensioners and reverse David Cameron's tax cut for millionaires. Accusations that we will end pensioner benefits are simply untrue.'
