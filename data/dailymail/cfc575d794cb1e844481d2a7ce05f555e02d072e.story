It may be a country that's home to high-end designers such as Giorgio Armani, Fendi and Dolce & Gabbana but the women of Italy are seeking wedding dresses from somewhere a little more unexpected.

Thrifty brides are heading to Argentinian nun Sister Maria Laura's atelier at the St Rita monastery, a medieval complex hidden among the central Umbrian hills, to find their dream gown.

Sister Maria Laura and her team run a second-hand wedding-dress service where disadvantaged brides once came to collect a wedding dress.

However, as Italian brides seek cheaper weddings, the atelier, which was revamped in October to meet demand, has never been busier.

The monastery was occupied by St Rita, an abused bride and widow, 600 years ago. She was married off by her parents when she was just 12 to a violent and abusive husband.

Charitable: Women began donating their dresses out of solidarity and as an offering to St Rita back in the 1950s and the collection has now amounted to hundreds (pic credit: Nadia Shira Cohen/The New York Times/Eyevine/Redux)

Eighteen years into her marriage, her husband was murdered in a family feud, and St Rita was admitted to the Augustinian convent of St Mary Magdalene.

Women travelled far and wide to come and pray to her for their marriages to be saved.

Women began donating their dresses out of solidarity and as an offering to St Rita back in the 1950s and the collection has now amounted to hundreds.

Seamstress and designer Sister Maria Laura, who entered monastic life when she was 28, now runs the establishment and claims she can find the perfect gown for any bride who comes her way. 

Variety: Using her design expertise, she alters the dresses to create open backs with ribbons, suggests where to cut the neckline, and reassembles inner padding to suit the particular bride

Sister Maria Laura is visited by around three women a week, and between eight and ten per month leave with their dream dress.

Using her design expertise, she alters the dresses to create open backs with ribbons, suggests where to cut the neckline, and reassembles inner padding to suit the particular bride.

In return for her services, many women return their dresses after their wedding so that another woman can have the same experience as them and some leave up to £700 as a token of their appreciation, according to The New York Times. 

'It gives me great joy to see a young woman who can fulfil her dream of love with a dress appropriate for the happiest day of her life,' said Sister Maria Laura.
