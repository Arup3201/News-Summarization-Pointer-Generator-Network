When you smile at your boss and he beams back, you might assume it means he is happy with your work.

But don’t be fooled – he may just be taking pity on you.

A study has found that those who feel powerful tend not to smile back at important people, saving their smiles instead for those below them in the pecking order.

Sleazy grin: A study has found that those who feel powerful save their smiles for those below them in the pecking order

Researcher Evan Carr said: ‘Our 
interpretation of this is that when you are feeling powerful and see a 
low-status person, you are almost throwing them a bone, thinking “Oh, I 
should smile at this person because I’m better than them”.’

It is well known that we tend to 
mimic other people’s body language, but Mr Carr wanted to see how we 
copy facial expressions and whether power and status are important.

He asked 55 young men and women to 
write about a time when they felt powerful – such as leaving home to go 
to university – or powerless.

They were then hooked up to equipment
that measures the activity of key facial muscles, and were asked to 
watch short video clips of people with jobs with different levels of 
prestige, who were smiling or frowning at them.

As they watched, the equipment 
measured the activity of the zygomaticus major – the ‘smiling muscle’ 
that raises the corner of the mouth.

It also gave readouts for the corrugator supercilii, the ‘frowning muscle’ that furrows the brow and is frozen by Botox.

The results showed that the 
volunteers were more likely to scowl in response to a frown from a 
doctor or someone in a position of power.

These frowns were also more intense, the Society for Neuroscience’s annual conference in New Orleans heard.

But it was the volunteers’ responses to smiling faces that were really telling.

The ugly truth: Evan Carr's research suggests the less appealing reasons why your boss might be smiling at you

The men and women who felt powerful tended not to smile back at high-fliers.

But they did return the smiles of those who were lower down the pecking order – and their smiles were bigger.

Meanwhile, those who felt powerless smiled at everyone, regardless of their rank.

The researchers think that people who 
feel powerful try to exert their dominance by not appearing too friendly
to those who might be a threat. They have no such qualms about 
appearing approachable to those who lack authority.

Changes in the volunteers’ 
expressions were too small to be seen by the eye but Mr Carr, from the 
University of California, says clearly visible smiles may follow the 
same pattern.

He said it is likely that the decision to suppress or return a smile occurs subconsciously.
