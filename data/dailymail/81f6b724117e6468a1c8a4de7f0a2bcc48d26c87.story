Female sex dolls have been around for decades. 

But until now, the rubber women have taken on an extremely fake quality, with even the untrained eye able to spot one from a mile off. 

But in this new photo shoot by New York fashion photographer Stacy Leigh, many of the toys appear very human-like.

Photographer Stacy Leigh from New York has 12 dolls of her own. She positioned the toys in fashionable clothing and life-like poses. Stacy wanted to prove that the mannequins can be very attractive.

The collection of love dolls worth up to £4,000 each, have been carefully dressed and posed as if they are taking part in a glamour shoot.

Stacy, 43, decided to create her project, which she calls 'Average Americans' to prove how anyone could find themselves fancying mannequin-like dolls, taking the stigma away from those who use them.

She said: 'Men and women both use the dolls as replacements for human companionship, whether by choice or necessity.'

'I believe it's perfectly fine if it makes one's journey through life more bearable.'

She continued: 'My photos are about life and relationships and sexuality.

'Some people are repulsed by the dolls, while others are empathetic towards them.

'As the world becomes more digital and less personal, dolls and robots will become more commonplace as surrogates for relationships.

'I can only hope that my photos spark an emotion or connection in the viewer.'

A world away from blow-up sex dolls of the past, love dolls or real dolls as they are also known, have become increasingly popular as they have become more realistic looking.

Many collectors refer to their love dolls as their 'girlfriends' and have full sexual relationships with them.

When buying a love doll, customers can choose to customise everything from hair, eye and skin colour to boob size and even the shape and style of the vagina.

Stacy, who owns 12 real dolls, explained how she became involved in collecting and photographing her plastic subjects.

She said: 'I watched a TV show called REAL SEX on HBO that featured Real dolls.'

'I had always wanted a life size doll, as I have been collecting small fashion dolls since I was a child.

'I perused the internet with the intention of using a love doll as my sitting model for photography.

'When my first doll arrived, I began to photograph her and the rest is history.

'Over the last decade, my job has become far easier as manufacturers add more realism to their products.'

She continued: 'These days, for my personal projects- I add make up to completely confuse the viewer.

'I've added wrinkles and depth to the face, much in the same way I would a painting.

'I received accolades for my ability to pose, and 'breathe life' into them.

'Immediately, it became my goal to get better with each photo.'
