UEFA chief Michel Platini committed himself to staying in charge of European football for the next five years and not challenging Sepp Blatter for the FIFA presidency.

Platini summoned all 54 European federations to Monaco to tell them he would stand for another term as UEFA supremo next year despite being the confederation's best bet to fight Blatter for the FIFA crown.

But Platini made it clear that he wanted to work for UEFA - ensuring beyond any doubt that Blatter will be elected for another four-year term in 2015 as he already has the support of five confederations around the world..

Not standing: Michel Platini has ruled himself out of the running for the FIFA President's job

Veteran: 78-year-old Sepp Blatter has been the president of FIFA since 1998

Platini said: 'This was my choice based on my passion. May be one day I will be moving on but not yet. I want to go to the end of my contract with UEFA and there is stlll a few years until the end.

'I chose from my heart, from football and from passion. I am more committed then ever to developing football in Europe.'

However the UEFA President was a lot less aggressive towards FIFA and Blatter than many of the delegates expected him to be.

Platini said: 'European football has never been stronger. My goal is not to attack FIFA as some of you were expecting me do. But what interests me is UEFA and only UEFA. I hope somebody opposes Mr Blatter, but it will not be me. 

Backtrack: Platini had previously called for a 'breath of fresh air' at the top of FIFA

'I have helped Mr Blatter in the past, but I will not be supporting him in the next selection. It's not a debate between UEFA and FIFA. I still respect Mr Blatter, but I will not back him in 2015.'

Platini, having confirmed his desire to stay at the helm of UEFA, now wants Europe to be united around the FIFA ExCo table.

Platini said: 'The UEFA members on FIFA should bring ideas to the table. They should not always be sheep saying yes and allowing Mr Blatter to be omnipresent.'
