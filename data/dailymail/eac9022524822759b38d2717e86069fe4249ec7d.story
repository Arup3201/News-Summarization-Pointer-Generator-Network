According to the fashion world, the Seventies are back — and there’s no one happier about it than me, as someone who lived and breathed every second of it.

Designers such as Prada, Tom Ford and Gucci showered catwalks last year in flares, jumpsuits, wide-brimmed hats and wild prints. But the retro revival doesn’t stop at the ankles; summer stilettos have been ditched in favour of towering platforms on almost every High Street in the country. 

As a top model during the Seventies, I lived in platforms. Bigger was always better, especially because — at 5 ft 8 in — I was a little on the short side for the fashion world.

As a top model during the Seventies, Jilly Johnson (pictured in early Seventies) spent a lot of time wearing platform shoes

I had to bluff my way through shoots with billowing bell-bottoms and chunky shoes that looked fun, flirty and fabulous. But now, aged 61 and with 11 grandchildren, I’m not sure I can carry them off with such aplomb.

Surely thin, slimming lines and elegant shapes are what I’m after rather than weighty clodhoppers?

To find out if they can ever be flattering, I put eight pairs through their paces.

Completely inappropriate — but I think these are divine. I had a pair of red snakeprint platforms by Terry de Havilland like these more than 40 years ago. Sadly, those days are gone. No one over 30 should attempt these now. At 6 in, they are impossible to walk in, though the colour is fabulous. I’d call these ankle breakers.

Wearability: 3/10

Clarks, £150

Help! These look like dumb-bells stuck to my feet. They are out of proportion with my legs. I look absurd. Not even wearing these shoes with a delicate dress saves them. No thank you.

Wearability: 0/10

Next, £35

These work because the straps are thin and dainty and the heel is not a thick wedge. They would jazz up a tailored suit or little black dress perfectly. I’d buy them in a heartbeat.

Height: 5 in

Wearability: 9/10

Russell & Bromley, £125

These are reminiscent of my Seventies ‘peace, love and brown rice’ days. The clog style is not sophisticated enough for a lady in her 60s. I clumped about as though walking on stilts.

Height: 5 in

Wearability: 2/10

Dune, £79

My absolute favourites: the front platform (about an inch thick) is just enough to boost your height without looking clunky. Orange is a bright and breezy colour for spring and summer.

Height: 4.5 in

Wearability: 10/10

Zara, £49.99

I know I shouldn’t, but I love these skyscrapers. Forty years ago, I would have practically slept in them. Padded soles and thick ankle straps mean they are surprisingly comfortable.

Height: 5 in

Wearability: 6/10

Topshop, £55

From the knees down I look great, but I’m not sure a 61-year-old can get away with these. They are as subtle as a sledgehammer and too cumbersome in heavy looking black.

Height: 5½ in

Wearability: 6/10

Office, £65

One of the sturdiest pair of heels I’ve ever worn. The soft leather and mule style is spot-on Seventies. The open toe is perfect for summer and these are age appropriate, too. Hallelujah!

Height: 4 in

Wearability: 10/10
