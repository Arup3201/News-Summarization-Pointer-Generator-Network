Anyone expecting England to undergo a radical last-minute change of World Cup heart and come out all guns blazing under Eoin Morgan can think again. Alastair Cook may have gone but the one-day game-plan remains the same.

Morgan’s first public appearance as the new one-day captain, a low-key affair here ahead of the warm-up game against a Capital Territories XI, would have dashed the hopes of those expecting a dramatic transformation.

In confirming that Ian Bell has the first chance to step into Cook’s World Cup shoes Morgan emphasised that Alex Hales has it all to do if he is to become the flag bearer at the top of the order for a new, more dynamic 50-over England.

Bell was due to open with Moeen Ali at the Manuka Oval and will be given every chance to complete an unlikely journey from the periphery of the one-day side to taking on Mitchell Johnson and Co. in the World Cup opener on February 14.

It means that even though Cook has been jettisoned at the last minute England remain committed to having an experienced, more ‘orthodox’ player as opener to try to play the anchor role rather than two big ‘Twenty20’ hitters.

Bell gets the nod even though he was dropped after two matches of England’s one-day series defeat against Sri Lanka and would have almost certainly missed out on being in the squad at all had Cook survived the cut.

Now, though, a last, big one-day opportunity comes knocking at 32 for one of England’s classiest Test players but a man who has often under-performed in one-day cricket, scoring just three hundreds in 150 50-over appearances.

‘Belly is a class act, someone we’ve looked to for a long time to score a heavy weight of runs,’ said Morgan while insisting that there is still time for Hales and others to stake a claim. ‘He’s pretty key at the top of the order.’

The new one-day captain sounded very much like the old one when asked whether England need to be more aggressive if they are to make any impact in the triangular series that begins on Friday and next month’s World Cup.

Morgan confirmed in Canberra it is the veteran Bell who will be given the first opportunity to claim Cook's place

‘I think we have been aggressive,’ insisted Morgan. ‘We’ve made the change slowly and we saw glimpses of it in Sri Lanka. It will be a continuation of that in this World Cup but what I’d like to see is us combining that aggression from the younger players with one or two experienced ones to bat around them.’

So the tactics will remain the same but Morgan is sure to be his own man as England captain. ‘My method has always been to strip the game back to its absolute basics and make sure the atmosphere in the camp is pretty relaxed,’ said the Irishman. ‘The only differences to Alastair will be in character and a little bit of a change in beliefs. I have a simple way of viewing things as a captain.’

An example of his laid-back manner came in the way he slept through all England’s attempts to contact him in Sydney before Christmas to tell him he was succeeding Cook. ‘I woke up to a lot of voicemails,’ smiled Morgan.

‘The first person I spoke to was Jimmy Whitaker who offered me the captaincy — and I obviously said yes — and then Gus Fraser phoned me and said “You must have slept well” because I had 25 missed calls. To be fair, it was 4am!’

Once the news sunk in Morgan remembered that captains usually get a big say in selection. ‘Jimmy gave me an inkling of what the squad was going to be. He asked me if I would have any changes and I said “No, that’s our best squad”.’

That means there was no attempt by Morgan to try to find a way back for his exiled friend Kevin Pietersen, who he has publicly supported during England’s civil war while also managing to remain close to Cook.

‘The decision was clearly made a year ago that Kevin wasn’t going to be part of England cricket moving forward,’ said Morgan. ‘It was repeated on the day I became captain. I didn’t think about asking for that to be changed.’

Morgan described as ‘ambitious’ the offer made by Pietersen, presumably at least with part of his tongue in his cheek, to play for the Australian Prime Minister’s XI in England’s second warm-up match here on Wednesday. As it is any hopes Pietersen may have had of playing against England were dashed when Chris Rogers was called up to replace the injured Mike Hussey.

‘It’s a prestigious game so to think they might give a place to someone who is not Australian is ambitious,’ said Morgan. ‘But I don’t think it would have spiced the game up if Kev had played against us. It really doesn’t bother me.’

What has bothered him are the feelings of Cook, who looked certain to be England’s World Cup captain right up until a late change of heart by England.

‘Alastair was the first person to message me to wish me well,’ revealed Morgan. ‘We get on very well. When a decision like that is made it’s not very nice but it sums the guy up that he wished me all the very best.

‘I felt for him massively. It will be difficult for him but that’s the decision that was made and once we start here it will be a case of moving on.’

Another captain with much to contemplate is Michael Clarke who admitted he has his work cut out to play in the World Cup even though he was named in a formidable looking Australian squad.

Clarke has been given to Australia’s second cup game against Bangladesh on February 21 to prove his fitness otherwise he will be replaced, so it looks increasingly like he will at least miss the date with England at the MCG on Valentine’s Day that launches the tournament.
