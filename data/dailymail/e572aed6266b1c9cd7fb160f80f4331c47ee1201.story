The only journalist to have spent time with Oscar Pistorius during his murder trial is convinced the St Valentine's Day shooting was a 'tragic accident'.

Investigative reporter Mark Williams-Thomas said he believes the athlete's account that he shot Reeva Steenkamp after mistaking her for a burglar.

His comments come as Pistorius prepares to return to court tomorrow for the verdict in his murder trial that captivated and divided a global audience for the last six months.

'Tragic accident': Reporter Mark Williams-Thomas (left) believes Oscar Pistorius (picture, left, at his murder trial) is innocent of charges that he deliberately killed his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp last year

Speaking to ITV's This Morning from Pretoria in South Africa, Mr Williams-Thomas said: '[Pistorius] is obviously devastated.

'I think it’s very important to set out that Oscar admits to having shot - and obviously as a result of that - Reeva died.

'But he’s also very clear in that it was a very tragic accident, that he didn’t intend to, and he believed someone was in the house.

'And having spent time with him and spoken to him in real detail, and not just him but his family, and the evidence and the more I talk to him, I do believe that also it is a tragic accident.'

Prosecutors argue that Pistorius deliberately killed the law graduate by firing four rounds from a 9mm pistol through a closed toilet door in a fit of rage.

Defence lawyers, however, said there are 'two Oscars' - a world-class athlete and a highly vulnerable individual with a serious disability who acted out of fear, not anger, when he fired the fatal shots thinking she was a dangerous intruder.

'Broken man': Pistorius vomits in the dock during his murder trial after seeing horrific pictures of Reeva Steenkamp's injuries

When asked by This Morning host 
Phillip Schofield whether he felt comfortable being in the company of a 
man that could be convicted as a murderer, Mr Williams-Thomas replied: 
'Absolutely.'

He added: 'I 
feel comfortable talking to anybody. I’ve talked to Oscar, I’ve been 
seeing him obviously away from everybody else and I think the big 
difference is that everybody else is judging on seeing him in a court 
fashion and not away from that and in his normal family environment.

'I’ve
 been the only person in the world that's been able to do that... so 
I’ve seen him in a very different environment. And he is a broken man.'

If
 the judge decides Pistorius deliberately murdered Miss Steenkamp, he 
could face a life sentence, which in South Africa means 25 years in 
jail.

Rallying to his defence: Mr Williams-Thomas said he believes the athlete's account that he shot Reeva Steenkamp (pictured) after mistaking her for a burglar late at night

But even if that is her verdict, it is not the end of the case. There will be arguments before sentence is handed down and, most likely, an appeal to a higher court.

If Pistorius is acquitted of murder he can still be convicted on an alternative charge of culpable homicide, which could also carry a prison sentence.

But Mr Williams-Thomas said: '[Pistorius] made it very clear to me that actually whatever the punishment it comes down to tomorrow, that nothing will bring Reeva back, he still loves her dearly... and he wishes obviously that circumstances were different.

'He said that no punishment will be anywhere near the punishment that he has for himself because he's lost someone he was in love with.

'He was only going out with her for three months but they were still very much in a courting relationship.'

Pistorius denies all the charges, including three other firearm-related counts.
