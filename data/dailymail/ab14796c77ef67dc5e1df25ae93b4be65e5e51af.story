Tens of thousands of opponents and supporters of Egypt’s president have staged rival rallies in Cairo four days ahead of a nationwide referendum on a contentious draft constitution.

The demonstrations came hours after masked assailants set upon opposition protesters who were taking parting in a sit-in at Tahrir Square.

Security officials said birdshot was fired and knives and sticks were swung into the crowd injuring 11 protesters, according to the MENA state news agency.

Officials later said that five ‘hardened criminals’ were arrested in connection with the attack.

The violence has served as a stark reminder of the stakes in the political battle over the disputed draft constitution.

A
nationwide referendum will be held on Saturday and is expected to go 
ahead despite the head of Egypt’s key association of judges saying 90 
per cent of its members have voted not to oversee the poll.

The
announcement is unlikely to stop the referendum from taking place but 
casts further doubt on the legitimacy of the constitutional drafting 
process.

President 
Mohammed Morsi's deputy has said that if there are not enough judges to 
oversee the referendum, the vote can be staggered over several days. A 
faction of judges loyal to Mr Morsi has said it would not boycott the 
vote.

Egypt's political 
crisis began on November 22 when Morsi issued a decree granting himself -
and the Islamist-dominated panel writing the constitution - immunity 
from judicial oversight or challenge.

Those decrees sparked mass 
demonstrations, with opponents saying they were issued initially to 
protect the draft charter from the judiciary.

The
constitution has polarized the nation and triggered some of the worst 
street violence since Mr Morsi took office in June as Egypt’s first 
freely elected president.

Egypt's army chief will host national unity talks on Wednesday, seeking to end a growing political and economic crisis.

'We will not speak about politics nor about the referendum. We will sit together as Egyptians,' armed forces chief and Defence Minister Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said at a gathering of army and police officials on Tuesday.

The main opposition coalition has yet to decide whether it will participate.

Supporters of the constitution include Mr Morsi, his Muslim Brotherhood and ultra-orthodox Salafis.

Opponents include a collection of 
liberals, leftists and Christians who claim the draft charter restricts 
freedoms and gives Islamists vast influence over the running of the 
country.

In Cairo's Nasr 
City district, a Muslim Brotherhood stronghold, tens of thousands of the
president's backers, some of them waving Egyptian flags, rallied in 
front of a neighbourhood mosque.

‘I
want the chant of “Morsi” to shake the earth,’ a man on a stage set up 
in front of the mosque shouted into a microphone. ‘Alleyway to alleyway,
house to house, the constitution means stability.’

The
crowd grew rapidly as dozens of buses, most of them bearing license 
plate numbers from provinces outside of Cairo, offloaded thousands of 
Morsi supporters at the venue.

The crowd denounced the liberal opposition and its leaders, calling them undemocratic and accusing them of being loyalists of Hosni Mubarak, the authoritarian leader who was ousted in a popular uprising last year.

‘Those protesting at the presidential palace are feloul (remnants of the Mubarak regime) and counter-revolutionaries,’ said Mohammed Abdel-Aziz, a young Islamist protester. ‘They don't want Islam.’

Several hundred Islamists also have 
set up camp across town outside a media complex that is home to several 
independent TV networks critical of Morsi and the Brotherhood. The 
Islamists have threatened to storm the facility.

In
the nearby Heliopolis neighbourhood, tens of thousands of opposition 
supporters rallied outside the presidential palace, pushing their 
demands that Mr Morsi scrap the referendum on the charter.

With
four days left before the referendum, the opposition has yet to decide 
whether to campaign for a "no" vote or call for a boycott - something 
many see as a reflection of divisions within the opposition.

The
disparate opposition groups are led by reformist and Nobel Peace prize 
laureate Mohamed ElBaradei, Egypt's former foreign minister and Arab 
League chief Amr Moussa, and leftist politician Hamdeen Sabahi.

Cracks in the opposition's unity first appeared last weekend when one of its leading figures, veteran opposition politician Ayman Nour, accepted an invitation by Mr Morsi to attend a "national dialogue" meeting.

On Monday, another key opposition figure, El-Sayed Badawi of the Wafd party, met Mr Morsi at the presidential palace.

Mr Badawi later issued a statement saying he remained loyal to the opposition's goals: scrapping the draft charter and postponing the vote.

The opposition has rejected any dialogue with Mr Morsi until he shelves the draft constitution and postpones the referendum.

They have also demanded that Mr Morsi rescind decrees giving him near absolute powers. He withdrew those powers on Saturday, but insisted that the referendum will go ahead as scheduled.

Anticipating unrest on the day of the referendum, Mr Morsi has ordered the military to join the police in maintaining security and protecting state institutions until after the results of the vote are announced. The decree went into effect on Monday.
