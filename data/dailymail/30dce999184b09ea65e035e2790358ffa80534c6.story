Turns out Dr Mehmet Oz's appearance at a New York City accident scene wasn't the first time this week he's swooped in to help an ailing stranger.

Ken Roosa said the celebrity doctor dashed to his aid last Saturday after Roosa collapsed just after a 5K race in Salt Lake City.

Race TV footage shows Dr Oz, who hosted the event and was dressed in a red superhero cape, kneeling on the pavement to assist the 53-year-old Ohio man.

Roosa told KTVX-TV that he wasn't used to distance running and suffered dehydration and stress.

He was hospitalized for 30 hours. An initial diagnosis showed heat stroke with perhaps a heart arrhythmia.

A picture posted on Oz's Facebook on Saturday shows him at Mr Roosa's hospital bedside.

Dr Oz posted a picture on his Facebook following the incident, writing: 'While participating in the USANA Health Sciences Inc. 5k in Utah, one of my fellow runners fell next to me after completing the race.

'Ken Roosa could not breathe and frothy fluid was coming from his lungs, indicating pulmonary edema (drowning in your own secretions).

'After listening to his heart, we got
oxygen on him and transferred 3 bags intravenously; he quickly 
stabilized at the hospital. Tentative diagnosis is heat stroke combined 
with a possible heart arrhythmia.

'I
just saw him and he looks much better. Ken was lucky. I want you to all
remember to stay cool in the heat. Just to be sure, I may jog with Ken 
for the foreseeable future!'

On
Tuesday, it was Dr Oz to the rescue once again when he rushed to help a
female, British tourist struck by a cab in New York City.

Sian Green, 23, was struck in a Rockefeller Center plaza by the out-of-control cab as she sat with a friend eating a hot dog.

Union plumber David Justino fashioned a tourniquet with his work belt for one of Miss Green’s legs. He used a dog leash for the other injured leg.

Dr Oz, who was walking in the area, rushed over when he heard the accident. He credits Justino for saving the woman’s life.

Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said on Wednesday that the woman’s family is en route from Leicester in England. She remains sedated.

Police say the cab driver was issued a summons for being an unauthorized driver. The accident is under investigation and he could face other charges.
