He was loved for his delicate prints and colourful textiles but there was more to artist William Morris than a charming way with wallpaper.

Indeed, as a groundbreaking new exhibition on the Pre-Raphaelite painter reveals, Morris was not only a socialist firebrand who almost single handedly sparked the arts and crafts movement, he also had decidedly risqué tastes in gardening implements.

Included in Anarchy & Beauty: William Morris and his Legacy is a set of gardening tools created by sculptor Eric Gill which are guaranteed to raise an eyebrow or two.

Based on the story of Adam and Eve, the roller created for Morris by Gill shows the biblical couple in a rather compromising position.

Gill, now disgraced after being revealed to be both incestuous and overly fond of the family dog, was a friend of Morris' and shared his left-wing politics.

But eye-opening though Gill's designs are, it is Morris who proved to be the most radical as the diaries and copy of Marx's Das Kapital included in the collection make plain.

None of this comes as a surprise to curator and cultural historian Fiona MacCarthy, who says Morris believed that 'beauty was a basic human birthright' and as such, art should be available to everyone - including him.

So, and in spite of his membership of the Socialist League, Morris wasn't immune to the odd vanity project, including encasing his copy of Das Kapital in gold.

'Only William Morris would encase Karl Marx in a gold-tooled binding,' adds MacCarthy. 'It was part of his religion of nothing but the best – not for the elitist connoisseur but nothing but the best for the whole populace.'

Despite his lofty ideals, much of Morris' work ended up on the walls of the Victorian elite, although his 'art for everyone' philosophy made him enormously popular.

And that wasn't the only way in which he showed off his left-wing credentials. Like many other intellectuals of the time, Morris was fond of the mandal, an example of which is included in the exhibition.

Dating from 1880, the sandals became popular in the UK following a visit to India by Morris' friend, philosopher Edward Carpenter.

'Carpenter was the man who introduced the sandal to left-wing circles,’ reveals MacCarthy. ‘They became a kind of cult among left-leaning middle-class intellectuals.'

But the National Portrait Gallery exhibition, which opens this week, isn't only about Morris, his mandals and his risqué taste in gardening tools.

Among the 140 artefacts to star in the exhibition is a beautiful portrait of Morris' wife Jane as well as a striking peacock brooch made as part of the arts and crafts craze sparked by Morris and his friends.

Other highlights include striking pieces by Bernard Leach and Terence Conran, as well as furniture and jewellery that belonged to Morris himself.

‘In the 21st century, our art and design culture is widespread,' adds MacCarthy. 'But its global sophistication brings new anxieties. 

'We find ourselves returning to many of Morris’s preoccupations with craft skills and the environment, with local sourcing, with vernacular traditions, with art as a vital force within society, binding together people of varying backgrounds and nationalities. 

'This exhibition, as I see it, will not only explore what William Morris’s vision was but will suggest ways in which his radical thinking still affects the way we live our lives’.
