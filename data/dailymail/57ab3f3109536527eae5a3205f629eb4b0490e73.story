The Atlanta Braves are leaving Turner Field and moving into a new 42,000-seat, $672 million stadium complex in Cobb County in 2017.

Braves executives John Schuerholz, Mike Plant and Derek Schiller said Monday that the team decided not to seek another 20-year lease at Turner Field and began talks with the Cobb Marietta Coliseum and Exhibit Hall Authority in July.

The infrastructure at Turner Field was originally built for the 1996 Summer Olympics before being converted to a baseball park that opened in 1997.

Announcement: Braves executive Mike Plant, pictured, along with colleagues, John Schuerholz and Derek Schiller, announced the new plans on Monday

The stadium will be part of a 60-acre development near Cobb Galleria mall.

Plant says talks broke down with the Atlanta Fulton County Recreational Authority earlier this year.

He adds that the team has not signed a contract with Cobb County, but he's '100 per cent certain it will happen'.

Schiller says financing will come from the Braves and the Cobb County government. The team will be responsible for any cost overruns.

New location: The new stadium will be located at the northwest corner of the I-75 and I-285 intersection in Cobb County, 14 miles northwest of downtown Atlanta

According to the team’s website, the reason for leaving is because they do not think the venue 'can remain viable for another 20 to 30 years’.

‘Turner Field has served the Braves well since 1997, but it is in need of major infrastructure work, which will cost around $150 million.’

It says the upgrades are ‘functional ones’, such as replacing worn-out seats or upgrading the stadium's lighting, which would ‘do little to significantly enhance the fan experience’.

The website says the cost for additional projects to ‘improve the fan experience’, could exceed $200 million.

‘Those upgrades still wouldn't address the logistical challenges outside the stadium – lack of consistent mass transit options, inadequate number of parking spaces and limited access to major highways,’ says the Braves website.

It says the new stadium in Cobb County will be at the heart of a new entertainment complex, which will be open every day of the year.
