Distressing photos show a toddler boy strapped to his nap cot at a Texas daycare that is currently under investigation for child abuse.

The saddening photos were taken at Heart2Heart Montessori Cchool by teacher Hannah Tidwell, who witnessed facility owner Pamela Decker carrying out the abusive act on a 2-year-old boy.

Tidwell then sent the pictures to the boy's parents, Kristi and Brad Galbraith, saying their son was one of two boys and a little girl restrained during nap time.

The Star-Telegram reports that when Tidwell confronted Decker about the act, she said:  'Do not say anything about this. I know this [is] illegal but felt it was necessary.'

Confined: A day care in Texas is under investigation for child abuse charges after pictures were taken, showing two boys strapped to their nap mats with duct tape

Abuse: Heart2Heart Montessori co-owner Pamela Decker is the woman accused of carrying out the distressing act

Now the Galbraiths are suing the school and Decker, seeking damages between $200,000 and $1million.

'I feel like this should never happen to any child,' Mrs Galbraith told NBC Dallas/Fort Worth. 'I was angry, I was shocked, I felt an extreme amount of guilt about how I could have chosen a place that would do this to my child.'

Shocked: Kristi Galbraith pulled her son, one of the toddlers pictured, out of the school immediately after seeing the evidence 

After informing Child Protective Services about the duct-tape incident, Tidwell elaborated on other abusive actions she witnessed at the child care center.

She said one other child had been left alone in a room, and that kids were denied water throughout the day to reduce diaper changes.

The Galbraiths immediately pulled their son out of the school after seeing the pictures, and started informing other parents of the alleged abuse.

When they confronted Decker about the incident, she initially 'appeared to shrug off the accusation as implausible,' according to the lawsuit. 

'It was only after the Galbraiths advised her that they had copies of photographs of their son duct taped to the nap mat that Ms Decker became visibly shaken; not distraught with what she had done but rather distressed that she had been caught,' the suit states.

Torri Almquist's son was one of the other children strapped to a bed, and she was contacted by Decker before hearing from other parents.

According to the lawsuit, Decker called Almquist and told her that Tidwell was spreading false accusations about her because she was 'pregnant and hormonal'.

She admitted to using duct tape on the boys but said the Galbraiths were blowing the whole incident out of proportion.

Open: The day care remains open, pending the investigation, but with far fewer students. The day care previously issued a statement saying they are cooperating with investigators 

She told Almquist 'that she did something "incredibly stupid and one of the dumbest things she had ever done" and decided to duct tape her son and the other little boy to their nap mats.

'Decker apologized to Ms Almquist and advised her that other parents "were freaking out" and that the Dad of the other little boy had sent out a "big email," ' the lawsuit reads.

Decker then held a school meeting on June 19 where she described the incident, saying she had tried several times to get the boy down for a nap and then made a 'very foolish decision' to place a strip of duct tape across his blanket.

'He was quiet. He never cried. He never complained. He was not in any anguish. … He was not harmed in any way, emotionally, physically, at all,' Decker allegedly told the parents, according to the lawsuit.

Victims: Lorri Almquist's son was also strapped to a nap mat. She says she is also looking into her legal options 

She called it 'stupid' and 'inappropriate' and claimed the duct tape was only touching the blanket and not actually holding the child down.

In the images, that's clearly not the case.

She also said she self-reported herself to the center's director and Child Protective Services but attorneys say that reporting only happened after she found out about the photos.

The day care center is currently under investigation by local police and the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services.

Evidence will be presented to a grand jury later this week, according to a Willow Park Police spokesman.

Child Protective Services plans to wrap up their investigation this week as we;.

The day care remains open, pending the investigation, but with far fewer students.

They previously issued a statement, saying they are cooperating 'fully' with the investigation.
