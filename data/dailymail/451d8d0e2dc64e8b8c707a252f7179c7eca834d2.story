The sound of popping champagne corks and hushed conversations fills the small garden terrace. Fairylights twinkle in the palm trees, illuminating the frescoed ceilings of the Chateau Marmont.

Beyond the tall, white walls of LA's most historic hotel - built in the Twenties - is the murmur of Hollywood, where on Sunday Eddie Redmayne's Oscar dreams came true.

In the hotel restaurant, my fish comes with a sprinkling of Hollywood glamour - Eva Longoria and Richard Gere are dining.

Glamour at every turn: Tourists can gain a close glimpse of the Hollywood sign with via a ranch ride

No one bats an eyelid, except me.

Running into the odd A-lister - or desperate housewife - is business as usual in Hollywood, particularly in awards season.

But you don't stand much chance if your Tinseltown experience is limited to the Walk of Fame and cemented handprints outside the TCL Chinese Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard.

Happily, there are plenty of better hotspots where you can catch up with your favourite celebs.

I spy Susan Sarandon at the bar of the Sunset Tower Hotel, where Eddie Redmayne, was spotted the night before the Oscars.

The following evening, I dodge the paparazzi waiting for Jessica Alba outside Craig's Restaurant in West Hollywood.

I am tucking into my southern fried honey chicken when she slips out via the kitchen.

The next morning, while crowds gather at a glossy shopping complex for a mediocre view of the Hollywood Sign, I venture deep into the surrounding hills to get the ultimate glimpse.

Marilyn is saddled up and waiting at Sunset Ranch ahead of a morning's horse riding in the Hollywood Hills.

Leading the way in cowboy hat is guide Lila, who once took the Beckhams out for a ride.

'Yes, even Victoria!' says Lila.

'She was a natural.'

We make our way along some of the 56 miles of sandy trails that lace Griffith Park, one of the largest in the States and named after the 19th-century colonel who donated this land to the city.

It's an unusual way to experience Hollywood, agrees Lila, as we peer down into cacti-studded canyons sheltering coyotes and rattlesnakes.

Looming large on the slopes of Mount Lee is the Hollywood Sign.

A part of LA's history since 1923, when it originally read 'Hollywoodland' to advertise a nearby property development, the sign hasn't always been such a happy spot.

Actress Peg Entwistle committed suicide here, jumping to her death from the letter 'H' in 1932.

Sunday morning in Tinseltown and there's only one place to be: the Farmer's Market on Ivar Avenue.

The man in focus: Eddie Redmayne (pictured with wife Hannah) was the big winner at this year's Oscars

Between 8am and 1pm, the streets between Hollywood and Sunset Boulevards are closed to traffic as hundreds of food and handicraft stalls are set up.

This is where local foodies - including Cameron Diaz and Claire Danes - come to pick up their groceries.

Just up the road is the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, a glorious Spanish-inspired property that's earned its place in history.

Not just as the birthplace of the Oscars - the first ceremony took place in the Blossom Ballroom in 1929 - but for the showbiz royalty that have stayed and played here.

Shirley Temple learnt to tap dance on the tiled staircase in the lobby and regular guest Marilyn Monroe (she preferred room 246) loved the place so much that she still visits.

Her ghost is said to haunt the hotel.

And you can't get much more Hollywood than that.
