A 20-year-old man has been charged after he allegedly threatened to shoot a random pedestrian if his Twitter post was retweeted a hundred times.

Dakkari Dijon McAnuff was booked on suspicion of making criminal threats, police said last week.

The investigation began last Wednesday morning when police officers were notified about a photo on Twitter.

A 20-year-old man in LA is accused of vowing to trade retweets on Twitter for a murder. He posted this terrifying image of a rifle with a scope sticking out a window

It showed a rifle pointed at a Los Angeles street with the caption: '100 (retweets) and I'll shoot someone walking.'

Investigators say they were able to link McAnuff to the Twitter account and track it to a home in the downtown area, where he was arrested on Wednesday.

Police later determined the weapon was an air rifle, which was recovered from the home.

McAnuff's Twitter account @stillDMC has since been taken down.

However archived tweets revealed that he had also posted: 'Man Down. Mission Completed.'

There is no indication that any shots were fired or anyone was injured.

McAnuff is being held on $50,000 bail.
