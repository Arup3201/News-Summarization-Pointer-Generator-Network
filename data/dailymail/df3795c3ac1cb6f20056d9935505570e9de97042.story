Margaret Thatcher would have secretly ‘cheered on’ Ukip leader Nigel Farage for speaking out on immigration and Europe, ex-Tory Cabinet minister Jonathan Aitken has claimed.

As the Conservatives brace themselves to be beaten by Ukip in May’s European elections, Mr Aitken said Baroness Thatcher would have had ‘not just a sneaking sympathy but a lot of leanings towards Nigel Farage’.

The remarks risk reigniting the row over the former Prime Minister’s views almost a year after her death.

Mr Aitken, a former MP who went out with Baroness Thatcher’s daughter Carol for three years, said many of her political views were closer to Mr Farage than the Tory leadership.

Speaking at the Oxford Literary Festival, he said: ‘I think secretly she would have cheered him on. I think he voices a lot of her prejudices.

‘She would never have said I vote for Ukip, I vote for Farage. But a lot of the views Nigel Farage expresses ... on immigration, on the idea [that] Britain can manage as a worldleading nation without relying on the European Union, and above all she was really fed up [with] centralism and liberalism and Brussels domination,’ the Telegraph reported.

‘I think she would have had not just a sneaking sympathy but a lot of leanings towards Nigel Farage, without ever quite coming out for Ukip.’

Mr Aitken was a Tory MP from 1974-97, serving in John Major’s Cabinet for a year as Chief Secretary to the Treasury. He was jailed for perjury in 1999.

He made the remarks while promoting his book, Margaret Thatcher: Power and Personality, which he says covers the period when ‘she goes off the rails’ after her resignation.

Earlier this month he claimed Baroness Thatcher promoted male MPs based on whether they were good-looking or not.

She was a ‘surprisingly insecure’ woman who was ‘very influenced by male good looks’, he told a book festival in Bath.

The claim that Baroness Thatcher would have sympathy with Ukip was controversially made by Mr Farage himself last year, days after she died at the age of 87.

Speaking at a Parliamentary Press Gallery lunch, Mr Farage sought to claim Baroness Thatcher as a UKIP supporter, arguing that if a young Margaret Roberts were setting out on the journey into British politics today she would reject Mr Cameron.

He said: ‘What is absolutely clear is that Margaret Thatcher from the mid-1990s thought this country should leave the European Union.

‘And I cannot believe that a young Margaret Thatcher leaving Oxford today would join the Conservative party led by John Major.

‘I think she’d come and get involved in UKIP and no doubt topple me within 12 months or so.’

When journalists pointed out to him that Sir John is not the Tory leader, and has not been since 1997, Mr Farage added: ‘Sorry Cameron I meant, but then what is the difference? I can’t spot them.’

However, the claims were dismissed at the time, with Tory MP Therese Coffey saying 'Farage talking garbage’.

And Conservative MP Conor Burns, a friend of the former premier, added: 'Sadly for him Margaret Thatcher was a tribal Conservative throughout her life and died a Conservative.
