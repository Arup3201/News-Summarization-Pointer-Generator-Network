A farm field overlooking the York River in Tidewater, Virginia, is believed to be where Pocahontas interceded with her powerful father Powhatan to rescue Captain John Smith from death.

The story goes that just as the great chief lifted his war club to carry out the execution, his young daughter laid her head on the English explorer's to protect him.

But that's a fanciful footnote for many Virginia Indians, historians and archaeologists, who say the real story is that this land was the centre of a complex, sprawling empire ruled by Powhatan long before the first permanent English settlement on American soil was founded in 1607.

It was called Werowocomoco, which roughly translates to a 'place of chiefs.'

'This is like our Washington,' said Kevin Brown, chief of the Pamunkey tribe. 'History didn't begin in 1607 and there are a lot of people who overlook that.'

On loan to archaeologists for more than a decade, these 57 privately owned acres will be preserved forever under an agreement years in the making and to be officially announced on Friday.

The deal is important for Native 
Americans because they believe their story has been overshadowed for 
centuries by the narrative of Captain Smith and his fellow Europeans.

In a departure from past digs 
involving native sites, archaeologists sought the counsel of Indian 
leaders before and during the exploration, honouring their wishes that 
burial grounds not be disturbed and helping interpret what was 
discovered.

For Ashley Atkins, a College of William & Mary doctoral candidate who has worked at the site since 2005, 'recovering things out of the ground' was secondary to working with her fellow Pamunkey.

'Unfortunately, native people in the past have had no involvement at all in the way that their history has been investigated, uncovered and presented to the public,' said Ms Atkins, who is 28.

'Most people would think, "They wouldn't be involved in uncovering your own history?" But the reality is that has not been the common practice.'

Jeff Brown, a Pamunkey and Kevin 
Brown's brother, worked at the site for years. He recalled Indians 
visiting the sweeping expanse overlooking the York River and being 
overcome.

'It gets emotional,' he said. 'And when you're digging you can really feel it.'

Martin Gallivan, a William & Mary anthropologist, said the involvement of native people 'enhanced the project immensely.'

Only
a fraction of Werewocomoco has been explored, perhaps just 2 per cent. 
After decades of research, archaeologists used the writings of Captain 
Smith and others, ancient maps and their own detective work to conclude 
with near-certainty that this was Powhatan's seat of power.

It was just 15 miles from Jamestown, the first permanent English settlement established in the New World.

Powhatan's
powerfulÂ  chiefdom covered 30 political divisions and a population of 15,000 to 
20,000 people, while nearby Jamestown settlers struggled to survive in their new environment.

Excavations have yielded the outline 
of the largest longhouse ever found in Virginia and a system of ditches 
that may have separated sacred and secular areas.

Randolph Turner, a retired state archaeologist whose hunt for Werewocomoco dates to the Seventies, said Powhatan's empire was 'one of the most complex political entities in all of eastern North America.'

The leader 'had the power of life and death' and expanded his empire through warfare or the threat of warfare.

'He's one of the most interesting political and military figures that I've ever read about,' Mr Turner said. 'And we're just getting hints in the historical records of all he accomplished in his lifetime.'

The discovery of Werewocomoco can be credited to a pure-bred dog belonging to the land's owners, Lynn and Robert Ripley.

Lynn
Ripley used to walk around their land with her Chesapeake Bay 
Retriever, an American Kennel Club competitor named Mobjack Rhett Master
Hunter. She would remove debris that could cut her dog's paws, and 
found arrowheads, spear tips, pipe stems and pottery shards.

'I
just seemed to have an eye for it,' she said. 'That's how it all began,
so our dog wouldn't cut his feet. It's like we were meant to be there 
and I was meant to find these things.'

The clincher was the discovery of copper, which was valued by the Indians as gold is today.

'I am absolutely convinced this is Werewocomoco,' Mr Turner said. 'It makes no sense for it to be anywhere else.'

That conclusion is supported by the U.S. Park Service, William & Mary, the Virginia Department of Historic Resources and the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities.

Virginia Indians hope work at the site will continue to build on what is known about Powhatan and the centuries before him, dispelling myths about what the first European settlers found when they arrived.

'I want people to understand there was a real civilisation, a complex cultural community that existed prior to European colonisation,' Ms Atkins said.

'Europeans didn't bring civilisation. They brought a lot of other things, some good, some bad.'

Kathleen Kilpatrick, executive director of the state's historic resources agency, said the site 'certainly tells an aspect of a story that often goes untold. In tangible ways, it is their Jamestown.'

may have separated sacred and secular areas

The preservation will be commemorated on Friday at a ceremony with Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell and Indian leaders.

An easement will ensure the site remains undeveloped and open to future exploration. It is part of more than 250 acres owned by the Ripleys, who have lived there for nearly 17 years.

When Ms Kilpatrick approached them with the idea of preserving the site, 'We decided it really is the best thing,' Robert Ripley said.

'If we do nothing else for Virginia Indians, we've done the very best because we have preserved it for all time with an entity that has the power to enforce its easement: the state of Virginia,' he said.

Mrs Ripley said, 'It's their heritage, their history. We felt a huge responsibility to protect it.' She hopes her collection of artifacts can be displayed someday in a museum on the site.

Centuries after Powhatan ruled, she added, this place still resonates with what it once was.

'It's definitely a sacred place,' she said. 'It's serene, it's spiritual, it's beautiful. I feel very good about what we've done.'
