They are horrific pictures which highlight the worrying deterioration in Egypt's security.

Two men - accused of stealing a motorised rickshaw - were badly beaten by vigilantes, stripped half-naked and hung by their feet in a crowded bus station in the Nile Delta.

A baying crowd of 3,000 people watched, with some shouting 'kill them'. Both men died.

Horrific: These two men - accused of stealing a motorised rickshaw - were badly beaten by vigilantes, stripped half-naked and hung by their feet in a crowded bus station in Egypt

The lynchings came a week after the attorney general's office encouraged civilians to arrest lawbreakers and hand them over to police.

It was one of the most extreme cases of vigilantism in two years of sharp deterioration in security following Egypt's 2011 uprising. The worsening security coupled with a police strike prompted the attorney general's call for citizen arrests last week.

The scene was emblematic of the chaos that is sweeping the country, mired in protests over a range of social, economic and political problems and with security breaking down to frightening proportions.

The state-run newspaper Ahram reported on its website that the two men were dragged in the street after being caught 'red-handed' trying to steal a rickshaw. It said they were beaten but alive before they were hung.

Witnesses claimed the men had kidnapped a girl inside the rickshaw, but that she escaped unharmed.

A photographer who witnessed the scene told The Associated Press that some in the crowd of around 3,000 threatened to kill him if he took pictures of the lynching.

He said that women and children in the crowd watched the men being hung by their feet, and that some even chanted in support of the lynching.

Residents also threatened to lynch another two men accused of being involved in the rickshaw theft. 

Photographs
from the scene show the two men hanging upside down from a rafter in 
their underwear at an open-air bus station in the town of Samanod, about
55 miles (90 kilometers) north of Cairo.

They appear badly beaten. Some initial reports said they were hung from a tree but photos from the scene showed it was a rafter.

Other
photographs show the men then lying on the ground dead in their 
underwear, with ropes around their feet. Their bodies are covered in 
dirt, bruises, blood and lacerations as a group of angry looking men 
gathered around them. One man in the crowd grasped a knife in one fist 
and another held up a bloodied wooden stick. 

The witness said the crowd then took the bodies to a nearby police station and dumped them at the front door.

Ahram
reported that police could not reach the site of the hangings because 
residents had cut off the roads to protest a shortage of diesel fuel, 
one of Egypt's many crises. Earlier in the day, residents of the nearby 
city of Mahalla had cut off a main train track to protest the fuel 
shortages. 

'The lack of 
security has created a sense of terror here,' the witness said, speaking
on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. 'The entire area is 
shut down because of protests against the fuel shortages.'

Security
officials said those who tried to help free the two men were pushed 
back by others in a crowd in the small town, which is in the Nile Delta 
province of Gharabiya.

They
said they are preparing for possible blood feuds between residents of 
Samanod and the nearby village of Mahallahit Ziyad, where the two men 
were from.

The bodies 
were taken to the morgue for identification, according to security 
officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not 
authorised to speak to the media.

Similar attacks have happened elsewhere in Egypt, though vigilante killings are not frequent.

In 2012 in northern Sharqiya province, 
police said relatives of a man who was killed when muggers tried to 
steal his car lynched one of the thieves.

They then burned his body while it 
hung on a light pole. Another vigilante incident that year was in the 
Nile Delta province of Mansoura, where relatives of a victim took 
justice into their own hands and lynched two suspected killers.

Citizens
have grown bolder in taking matters into their own hands following the 
2011 uprising that ousted longtime authoritarian ruler Hosni Mubarak. 
The country's once powerful and feared police force was left weakened 
after the revolt.

Egypt is embroiled in another wave of political unrest that has also engulfed the nation's police force.

Thousands
of officers and low-ranking policemen have broken ranks, staging 
protests and waging strikes against what they say is the politicization 
of the force by President Mohammed Morsi and his interior minister.

Some
of the striking police officers allege that the Brotherhood group is 
attempting to control them. The Brotherhood denies that.

Opponents
of the attorney general's call for citizen arrests fear that it is a 
prelude to the substitution of police by militias belonging to Morsi's 
powerful Muslim Brotherhood group and other allied Islamist groups.

On Sunday, Interior Minister Mohammed
Ibrahim, who oversees the country's police, met with officers and 
low-ranking policemen to hear their demands.

A
statement from the ministry said Ibrahim thanked the police for their 
efforts. Two days earlier, Morsi attended traditional Islamic prayers at
a Cairo-based camp for riot police where he praised the force despite 
public criticism over their violent response to anti-government 
demonstrations.

Also on 
Sunday, dozens of journalists protested outside their syndicate in Cairo
against what they claim were assaults on their colleagues by members of
the Brotherhood.

Diaa
Rashwan, the newly elected head of the syndicate who replaced a figure 
considered by most journalists as pro-Brotherhood, condemned the alleged
assault Saturday evening outside the Brotherhood's headquarters where 
journalists were covering a meeting.

The
journalists say that after activists sprayed anti-Brotherhood graffiti 
on the ground outside the headquarters, the Brotherhood guards attacked 
with sticks and chains.

The Brotherhood said in a statement that
guards outside the building were provoked and insulted by the activists
and journalists. Many of the group's offices were attacked across the 
country in December during violent protests over the drafting of the 
constitution.

Police fired tear gas and a police vehicle was torched during Saturday night's clashes. Al-Dustor opposition party, led by Nobel laureate Mohamed ElBaradei, blamed the Brotherhood's leadership for allegedly encouraging 'militias' loyal to the group to join the fight.

In other developments, the Supreme Administrative Court said a body of judges is reviewing an appeal against suspending parliamentary elections. The voting was slated to begin in April and be held in several stages through June. 

Morsi's Islamist supporters and some in the public exhausted by the turmoil hope the elections will be a step toward bringing some stability, accusing the opposition of stirring up unrest to derail the voting.

But the mainly liberal and secular opposition has called for a boycott of the vote, saying Morsi must first find some political consensus first to ease the wave of popular anger.
