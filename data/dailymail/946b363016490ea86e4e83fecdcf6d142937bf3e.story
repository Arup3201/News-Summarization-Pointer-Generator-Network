Ajaz Raja, 32, pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine with intent to supply and was jailed for two years and four months

A drug dealer has been jailed after police found his fingerprints on a Nando's napkin he had used to wrap cocaine.

Ajaz Raja, 32, pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine with intent to supply and was jailed for two years and four months.

Detectives found almost £7,000 of cocaine in a house in the Cheetham Hill area of Manchester - and Raja's fingerprints were discovered on a Nando's napkin he'd used to partially wrap some of the Class A drug.

Manchester Crown Court heard that on 19 November last year, officers from North Manchester's Organised Crime Unit conducted a drugs warrant at a house on Lytton Avenue, Cheetham Hill. 

They found cocaine with a street value of £6,960, dozens of unused snap bags, and a set of digital scales.

Raja's fingerprints were later found on a Nando's napkin he'd used to partially wrap a bag of cocaine in. 

PC Darren Wayman, of Greater Manchester Police said: 'No matter how well drug dealers think they cover their tracks they will always slip up, as in this case.

'Once we presented the prints evidence to him he has little option but to admit to the offence.

'He's now been jailed for more than two years so he won't be enjoying a meal out at Nando's, or anywhere else for that matter, for some time.'
