It cost Nasa $2.5 billion (£1.5 billion) to land their Curiosity rover on Mars.

But, with tongue firmly in cheek, perhaps they could have fooled us all by sending a rover to the abandoned Wheal Maid mine in Cornwall instead.

Photographer Mike Thomas’ incredible photos show how, in a secluded part of the UK, there is a landscape that looks as alien as anything any rover has seen on the red planet.

Mr Thomas had been unaware of the mine until a local told him to go and check it out. What he found absolutely blew him away.

‘I was a bit shocked,’ Thomas tells MailOnline. ‘I didn’t expect the colours to be so vivid, and it was pretty alien looking. It’s more like a Doctor Who set.’

The mine itself was first opened in 1782.

Although it was mostly used to mine copper, there were a number of by-products that are still present today.

These include black tin, arsenic, pyrite and zinc ore, all of which combine to produce the fantastic colours you can see in the images.

The mineral waste including copper, black tin, arsenic, pyrite and zinc ore has collected in a lagoon on the site producing vivid colours

The site is part of the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape World Heritage Site

‘What you’re seeing in the pictures are the remnants of mining silt that built up in the mines that is held in the lagoon on the site,’ continued Mr Thomas.

‘When the water level drops slightly, all the minerals stick to the side of the lagoons which is why you get all these odd colours.’

In addition to the lagoon, many plants are also coated in different minerals, with brambles appearing a metallic purple and willow trees a bizarre greenish-yellow.

The out-of-this-world effects occur all year round when heavy sunshine follows periods of rainfall.

With summer on its way, Thomas says it’ll look even more impressive on the balmiest of days.

Safety first: The council is confident that no significant damage is being done to the surrounding environment

The site is now used for mountain bike competitions, but strictly no motorbikes are allowed

Most of the site itself is a public right of way, with some of it used as a mountain bike circuit.

The local Gwennap Parish Council purchased the mine in 2002 for £1 from previous owners Carnon Enterprises.

An Environment Agency investigation into the site was carried out to check for possible contamination of the surrounding wildlife.

Initial reports said some areas were a risk due to high levels of arsenic but now, according to Parish Chairman Kevin Furnish, the site is largely safe to explore.

Wheal Maid was once part of a site called the Great Consolidated Mine.

First opened in 1782, the area was at times highly profitable.

The main produce was copper, along with smaller amounts of black tin, arsenic, pyrite and zinc ore.

By 1870, however, much of the useful minerals had been mined.

By the early 1990s the entire site was closed and later opened to the public by the council, who purchased it for £1.

‘A full investigation by the Environment Agency said that there are some places where you wouldn’t want to eat the soil or drink the water, but that’s pretty common to Corwnwall,’ he tells MailOnline.

‘There’s a slight impact on the local stream but, when taken into context of the whole watershed, it’s trivial as to what comes out of the tin mines further downstream.

‘There’s no impact at all on the area wider than a couple of hundred yards.

‘There are signs up which are there to educate people not just about the history and the environment, but also that they shouldn’t drink too much of the water.’

‘The risk analysis by the Environment Agency was that there is very little danger to anyone in the valley.’

With that in mind, Thomas points out that the area is a public right of way and anyone can go along to enjoy the beautiful scenery.

‘It’s beautiful in its own right,’ he concludes.

‘I wouldn’t swim in the lagoon though, no.’
