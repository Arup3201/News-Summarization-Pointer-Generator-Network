One of Australia's biggest car mechanic groups has had its website hacked to make a statement about the current conflict in the Middle East.

The website www.ultratune.com.au was hacked late Tuesday night by a group that referred to itself as 'Security Crews' and claimed to be 'the voice of Palestine'.

'Greetings to all citizens in this world!! I am the voice for Palestine! Please open your eyes wider for what happened around us... humanity is gone in our life now... it's full of cruelty and suppression,' the hackers wrote.

The hackers added that 'Khilafa will rise soon', which is in reference to a global leadership system for Muslims

'Killing others is an unacceptable act and this should be stopped. There is no religions and laws permits this action. For that, please open your mind and grab the ideas of which is rights and which is not.'

The hackers added that 'Khilafa will rise soon', which is in reference to a global leadership system for Muslims.

It is not clear why the hackers targeted the Australian company for their pro-Palelstine message across.

Ultratune is an Australian-owned company with 260 service centres across the country. The company has been servicing private and fleet cars for more than 30 years..

Reddit users have dubbed the hackers 'amateur idiots' for targeting the car company. 

'Basically what happens is that amateur idiots like this attack whatever website they can find that has the weakest security and also the one that matches the technique they're using to gain access,' one user wrote. 

'So, they're not making a statement about their target and the business they run, inadvertently they're only making a statement about about themselves and how they don't have the skills to take down any website that has anything to do with the topic at hand or is a more popular website.' 

Ultratune has been contacted for comment.
