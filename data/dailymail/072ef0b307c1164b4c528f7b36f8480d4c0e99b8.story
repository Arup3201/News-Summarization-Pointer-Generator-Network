Condemned: A federal judge has refused to stop the upcoming execution of Ohio killer Dennis McGuire, who raped and murdered a pregnant woman in 1989. He faces a never-tried lethal injection process that lawyers say could cause him agony and terror

A condemned Ohio killer who is due to be executed tomorrow, could face an agonizing death where he struggles to breathe in the last few minutes of his life.

Inmate Dennis McGuire's lawyers had argued that the combination of the sedative midozolam and painkiller hydropmorphone could lead to a painful and terrifying phenomenon called 'air hunger' before he actually dies.

It's the first time such a cocktail of drugs have been used in the state in this way, and the effects are unknown so much so that some have described the method as akin to an 'experiment'.

Lawyers for McGuire have attempted to stop his execution
 on the grounds he could experience a terrifying sensation of 
suffocation and that his sentencing him to death is unconstitutionally 
cruel.

U.S. District Judge Gregory Frost said the condemned man did not present enough evidence that there is 'a substantial risk' he will experience the "severe pain" that would constitute a violation of the ban on cruel and unusual punishment.

Last year, 450-pound inmate Ronald Post argued he was so overweight he could not be put to death humanely. Double-killer Richard Cooey made a similar argument in 2008.

In 2010, serial rapist Darryl Durr argued he might be violently allergic to Ohio's execution drug.

Each time, U.S. District Court Judge Gregory Frost, a veteran of the state's capital punishment legal challenges, ultimately allowed the execution to proceed. In his latest ruling, he said Monday that McGuire had failed to present evidence he would suffer breathing problems alleged by his attorneys - a phenomenon known as 'air hunger' - and said the risk to McGuire is within constitutional limits..

Also, because
 McGuire has several characteristics of sleep apnea, or the struggle to 
breathe while asleep, the chances are even greater he will be subjected 
to feelings of suffocation, an expert has warned.

'Mr. McGuire is at a substantial risk
 of experiencing the terror of air hunger during the first five minutes 
of the execution,' Professor David Waisel, of Harvard Medical School, 
said.

'Air hunger is a horrible feeling,' Waisel added. 'It's the inability to get your breath.'

Experimental: Some were concerned McGuire would experience terror as he strained to catch his breath due to Ohio's untested execution method

Punishment: The death chamber at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in Lucasville. Ohio used intravenous doses of two drugs, midazolam, a sedative, and hydromorphone, a painkiller, to put McGuire to death

Ohio
 plans to use intravenous doses of two drugs, midazolam, a sedative, and
 hydromorphone, a painkiller, to put McGuire to death.

The
 method has been part of Ohio's execution process since 2009, though 
never used. It was chosen because of a shortage of other lethal 
injection drugs.

That
 said, Frost acknowledged the novelty of Ohio's never tried two-drug 
combination, calling it 'an experiment in lethal injection processes.'

Victim: McGuire, 53, was sentenced to die for the 1989 rape and fatal stabbing of Joy Stewart in Preble County in western Ohio. The 22-year-old Stewart was newly married and pregnant

But
 until a method violates the Constitution, 'The law teaches that Ohio is
 free to innovate and to evolve its procedures for administering capital
 punishment,' Frost said.

The state opposed any delay, presenting evidence that disputed the air hunger scenario.

McGuire,
 53, is scheduled to die Thursday for the 1989 rape and fatal stabbing 
of Joy Stewart in Preble County in western Ohio. Attorneys say they're 
disappointed by the decision but pleased Frost recognized the untried 
nature of the process. They haven't decided whether to appeal.

McGuire
 has a separate request before the U.S. Supreme Court to delay his 
execution on the grounds that a jury never heard the full extent of his 
chaotic and abusive childhood. The state asked the court Monday to 
reject that appeal, saying McGuire's "challenges to his sentence have 
spanned decades and failed."

Post,
 the overweight inmate, was spared by Gov. John Kasich because of poor 
legal representation at trial, not his weight. He died of natural causes
 in prison last year. Cooey was executed in 2008 for the rape and murder
 of two female University of Akron students.

Durr was executed in 2010 with no apparent complications as he died.

As
 long ago as the 1990s, prisoners in California argued that the state's 
gas chamber could also produce "air hunger" in death row inmates. In 
1994, a judge found that prisoners in the gas chamber were likely to 
suffer excruciating pain for between 15 seconds and several minutes. The
 state has since adopted lethal injection but lawsuits have kept it from
 being used.

Frost's
 ruling moved McGuire one step closer to execution by the two-drug 
method developed after supplies of Ohio's former execution drug dried 
up. Kasich has rejected McGuire's plea for clemency.

Last
 year, Frost rejected a challenge to the two-drug method by death row 
inmate Ronald Phillips, who was set to become the first to die by the 
new method until Kasich delayed his execution to study the feasibility 
of Phillips' donating organs to family members.

Supplies of Ohio's former execution drug, pentobarbital, dried up as its manufacturer put it off limits for executions.

Ohio's
 Department of Rehabilitation and Correction plans to use a dose of 
midazolam, a sedative, combined with hydromorphone, a painkiller, to put
 McGuire to death.

The
 combination of drugs Ohio intends to use has never been used in a U.S. 
execution. They are included in Kentucky's backup execution method, and 
Florida uses midazolam as part of its three-drug injection process.
