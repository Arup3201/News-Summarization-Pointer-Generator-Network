A judge praised burglars for their ‘courage’ and claimed prison ‘very rarely does anybody any good’ as he allowed a serial intruder to walk free from court.

Judge Peter Bowers said burglar Richard Rochford deserved to be jailed for two-and-a-half years but he decided to take an ‘extraordinary chance’ by not locking him up.

Recognising the controversy he was  causing, the judge added: ‘I might get pilloried for it.’

Controversial: Judge Peter Bowers admitted he could be 'pilloried' for his 
decision to let Richard Rochford go free after he admitted to a string 
of burglaries

His astonishing comments were condemned 
by victims of the burglar and follow a series of controversial remarks 
by the same judge in previous cases.

Rochford, 26, burgled three homes in East Cleveland and tried to burgle 
another in the space of five days. He committed the crimes to feed a 
drug addiction that started when he was in prison for another offence, 
Teesside Crown Court was told.

Passing sentence, Judge Bowers told him: ‘It takes a huge amount of 
courage as far as I can see for someone to burgle somebody’s house. I 
wouldn’t have the nerve.

‘Yet somehow, bolstered by drugs and desperation, you were prepared to 
do that.’ The judge added: ‘I think prison very rarely does anybody any 
good. It mostly leaves people the chance to change their own mind if 
they want to. I don’t think anybody would benefit from sending you to 
prison today. We’d all just feel a bit easier that a burglar had been 
taken off the streets.’

Rochford could have been jailed for two-and-a-half years but instead he 
was given a suspended 12-month jail sentence, a two-year supervision 
order with drug rehabilitation, 200 hours’ unpaid work and a one-year 
driving ban. The offence was Rochford’s first burglary conviction, 
although he was cautioned for burgling a home at the age of ten. He has 
previously been jailed for three years for arson.

Rochford went on a burglary spree in February. He took a laptop, satnav 
and money from the first home he raided and drove away the family’s Ford
 Focus car, which he damaged and abandoned.

Judge Peter Bowers

The following night he took jewellery, a handbag and electrical items 
from another home. His girlfriend Amy Kyme, 22, who acted as lookout and
 helped dispose of the stolen goods, was given a suspended prison 
sentence. Rochford walked into both unlocked homes while the owners 
slept.

He admitted two burglaries and asked for another burglary and an 
attempted burglary to be taken into consideration. He also admitted 
aggravated vehicle taking.

Graham Brown, defending, told the court the drug habit Rochford 
developed ‘scarred his life’ and ‘the system failed him’. He claimed the
 petty crook had changed his ways.

Mr Brown said Rochford had had a ‘major wake-up call,’ and had ‘seen the
 light’. He confessed, co-operated with police and stopped using drugs, 
the court heard.

Rochford ransacked the home of Mark Clayton, 47, an Army veteran who 
served in Afghanistan and Bosnia. Mr Clayton said the judge made a 
‘grave misjudgment’.

He added: ‘Picking dead bodies up after they’ve been blown up, to go 
into that takes courage. Walking into someone’s house on an 
opportunistic whim and basically devastating someone’s life by taking 
things that man has worked so hard for all his life, and taking it away 
without a thought, isn’t courage.’

Mr Clayton said his son Mark, 16, was at first wrongly arrested on 
suspicion of the burglary, causing further upset for his family. 
Rochford stole a wallet containing £500 of life savings when he raided 
the home of retired shipyard worker John Hopper, 73, and wife Vera, 71.

Daughter Sharon Hopper, 40, said: ‘I can’t believe what the judge said. 
What really took courage was my parents having to continue living in 
their house after he had invaded their privacy.

‘Until the judge has had his own home burgled while he is lying asleep inside it, he cannot possibly know the fear and distress suffered by 
decent people like my parents.’

Judge Bowers, 67, is a married father of three who has been a judge for more than 20 years.

He has made contradictory comments about burglary sentencing in recent 
months. In May, he criticised sentencing guidelines that let first-time 
burglars escape with a ‘slap across the wrist’.

But weeks later, he allowed a man with almost 80 crimes on his record to
 walk free for a burglary committed four days after his release from 
prison, telling the court: ‘I must be getting soft in my old age.’

Judge Bowers then told David Wray, 39: ‘I am quite sure you are capable 
of a lot better. If you are bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, you’ll be all 
right.’
