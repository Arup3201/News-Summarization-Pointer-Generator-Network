He has one of the most glamorous day jobs imaginable and rarely has it looked more appealing than this week.

Twelve months ago, Rory McIlroy said that he had seen enough lawyers to last him a lifetime. So you can imagine what it has been like sitting in legal offices during the past six weeks poring over documents relating to his bitter dispute with his former management company, Horizon Sports.

‘Annoying and frustrating,’ is how the 25-year-old summed up being forced to sit out the first two events of the European Tour’s Final Series in China. It will be costly too, if he finishes on the losing side in the Dublin courtroom showdown, scheduled for February.

Those in Ireland who have been following the various machinations closely estimate he could be as much as £25million worse off if the worst-case scenario unfolds.

‘Of course I’m annoyed that it is still going on but there’s nothing I can do about it,’ McIlroy said. ‘We tried our best a few weeks ago to come to some sort of resolution and it didn’t work out. So yeah, it’s not the best thing to be going through but it will be over and done with a good bit before I have to go down Magnolia Lane (for the Masters) in April. As long as I’ve got a clear head going there, I’m happy with that.’

While he was away McIlroy was formally declared the winner of the Race to Dubai.

And, free of legalese here for a few days at least, he will hope to add the season-finale DP World Tour Championship title to his Race win, as he did in 2012, and be handed both prizes at Sunday’s presentation.

‘I’m still very motivated to go out this week and perform well,’ he said. ‘There would be no point me showing up if I thought I had already won something and was just here for a good time. It has been such a fantastic year I want to round things off and get two trophies rather than one.’

The blisters on McIlroy’s right hand are evidence of how hard he has been working since arriving in Dubai a week ago, as was a wonderful stroke he played on Monday.

The tour had organised for some of the leading players to replicate iconic shots in the tournament’s history. They all got to try Henrik Stenson’s extraordinary three wood to the par five 18th a year ago that saw him wrap up the Race to Dubai with a tap-in eagle three. No-one got close. Well, not until Rory casually coaxed yet another majestic fairway wood shot from 260 yards to within an arm’s length of the hole.

It underlined his liking for an Earth course where he has compiled some jaw-dropping figures. He is 74 under par for his 20 rounds of golf here, with nothing worse than a 72 — and only one of those. In the other 19 rounds, he has had five 66s, five 67s, two 68s, two 69s, and five 71s.

And maybe those six weeks away will work in his favour.

‘I’m sure there are some tired minds and bodies among the players who competed in the last three events in China and Turkey and I am hoping to take advantage,’ McIlroy said. He has also underlined his commitment to European golf.

As the new host of the Irish Open, he has persuaded charismatic American Rickie Fowler to pitch up at Royal County Down next May.

And the Scottish Open in July will definitely form part of McIlroy’s schedule in the build-up to the defence of his Open title at St Andrews.

All good news surrounding the world No 1, then, apart from that ugly legal battle. Let’s hope good sense prevails between now and next February, because the one certain loser if the combative lawyers get to stand on their feet will be the game itself.
