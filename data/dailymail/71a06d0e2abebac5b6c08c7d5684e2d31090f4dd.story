A Florida man who bought a home at auction got a gruesome surprise when he went to look over the property on Tuesday and found a corpse on the bedroom floor.

Cape Coral, Florida police are now conducting a death investigation at the home, where neighbors say they haven't seen or heard from the last resident in years.

New owner William Wilson bought the home on SE 19th Lane for $96,000 and went over to the home earlier this week to mow the lawn and trim the hedges when he found the body next to the master bedroom bed.

What happened? William Wilson bought this Cape Coral, Florida home for $96,000. He went over to the house on Tuesday to mow the lawn and trim the hedges, and ended up finding a dead body in the master bedroom 

'You couldn’t tell who it was,' Mr Wilson told the News-Press. 'You couldn’t tell if it was a male or a female ... it’s disappointing and a sad thing that nobody cared enough to check.'

He said the house was a cluttered mess, like someone was in the process of moving and that there were pictures of children on the fridge.

There was also a bird cage and a pile of feces on the living room floor. The most recent piece of mail was from November 2011 and the property taxes hadn't been paid for the past three years.

Neighbors say the home was last occupied by an older woman from Miami who lived with her sister.

According to public records, the home was previously owned by a Carmen Garcia-Viso.

They thought she had moved or disappeared since they hadn't seen her in years.

Neighbor Gary Oben Jr, 30, said the woman was nice although she was reclusive and didn't speak much English. He says he only ever saw her when she went to get the mail or watered the lawn.

'I had a hunch,' Mr Oben said. 'Either it was a grow house or there was a dead lady in there.'

Who is she? Neighbors said they hadn't seen or heard from the previous resident of the home for years. They say the last woman who lived at the address was reclusive and lived with a sister
