A Pennsylvania father has shot and killed his two-year-old son and wounded his estranged wife before driving into the woods and killing himself.

Police said Kenneth Ayers also shot at his mother during the altercation on Saturday morning at her home in a rural area about 20 miles southwest of State College.

Huntingdon County District Attorney George Zanic said Mr Ayers, 52, was subject to a protection from abuse order filed by his wife but was permitted visits with his son, Michael.

Scene: Pennsylvania father Kenneth Ayers shot and killed his two-year-old son Michael and wounded his estranged wife Hollie Jo before driving into the woods and killing himself

Saturday's visit was to happen at his mother's home in Barree Township.

But once at the home, Mr Ayers got into a fight with his Michael's mother, Hollie Jo Ayers, and shot her in the legs and arm with a .40 caliber handgun.

He then intentionally shot his son, police said.

Mr Ayers placed the child's body in the back of his vehicle but the wounded woman retrieved the body before Ayers shot her again in the face, police said. He also fired at his mother but missed.

'The shooting happened outside by her vehicle, right outside the back door and that's where Michael was shot,' Zanic told WTAJ.

'Words can't describe the scene ... heartbreaking,' he said.

Baree resident Olivia Ellenberger told the TV station she saw Mr Ayers fleeing the scene.

'This is the first time anything like this has happened since I lived here. It's different,' Ellenberger said.

Mr Ayers' body was found several hours later in his parked truck in a wooded area in Warriors Mark Township. Investigators said he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Ms Ayers was transported to a hospital and expected to survive, according to police.

State police Cpl. Daniel Sneath said investigators are trying to determine what led to the shooting and why Mr Ayers was carrying a gun despite the protection order.

Police will also seek an autopsy to determine whether Mr Ayers was under the influence drugs or alcohol.
