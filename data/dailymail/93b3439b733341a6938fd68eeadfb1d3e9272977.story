Real Madrid's stars have been in training ahead of the first leg of their Super Cup battle with bitter cross-town rivals Atletico on Tuesday.

Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale led the way during the session, with new boys James Rodriguez and Toni Kroos also involved at their training base in Madrid.

Also in attendance were Sami Khedira and Angel di Maria, who have both been linked with a host of Premier League clubs throughout the summer. 

Usual suspects: Cristiano Ronaldo, forward Karim Benzema, Fabio Coentrao and Gareth Bale set up some hurdles during a session

Back in action: And Sami Khedira was also back in training despite continued speculation that he is set for a move away from the club

New boys: Toni Kroos and James Rodriguez will both hope to impress as they look to continue their good start at Real Madrid

Competition: Goalkeepers Iker Casillas and Keylor Navas are set to face off for the No 1 jersey at Real Madrid this season

Face off: Navas had a superb World Cup with Costa Rica whilst Casillas had a slightly more disappointing tournament with Spain

And despite being linked with a big-money move to Manchester United before the end of the transfer window, Carlo Ancelotti has insisted that Di Maria will be available for selection to him. 

'I don't want to enter into this theme so I don't lose focus on tomorrow's game,' said Madrid's boss. 'Di Maria is available like all the others. He may or may not start the game and has opportunities, but like everyone else.

'What I won't do is put out the same team in both legs. One team will play tomorrow and on Friday I will change it a little.

'I don't know what Di Maria has decided. But I know that he's training and that he could help us in tomorrow's match. Until August 31 it will continue the same way and after that everything will be cleared up and things will return to normal.'

The first leg of the tie is set to take place at the Bernabeu, with the return leg on Friday at Atletico's home the Vicente Calderon. It is the first time since 2008 that Barcelona haven't been involved in the Spanish curtain-raiser.

Training together were Real Madrid captain and stalwart Iker Casillas, and new goalkeeper Kaylor Navas, who signed for the club over the summer. 

Casillas started Real Madrid's first game of the season in their 2-0 UEFA Super Cup victory over Sevilla last week, but Costa Rican Navas is expected to provide stern competition for his No 1 jersey over the course of the campaign. 

Against Sevilla, Real Madrid put out the most expensive starting team in the history of football thanks to arrivals of Colombian Rodriguez from Monaco for £60m and Toni Kroos from Bayern Munich for £20m. 

Ronaldo, Bale, Karim Benzema and Luka Modric formed the rest of Real Madrid's midfield and attack, and they are set to lineup with the same team against their rivals.

For Atletico, it is their first competitive game of the season, and Diego Simeone will be hoping that Mario Mandzukic's arrival from Bayern Munich can provide adequate cover for the departed Diego Costa.
