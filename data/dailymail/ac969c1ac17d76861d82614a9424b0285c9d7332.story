Guilty: Ian Wilson 'opened fire' on two women using a child's water pistol, filled with his own urine

A middle-aged businessman used a child's water pistol to open fire at two strangers - with his own urine.

Ian Wilson, 56, has been ordered to pay £50 to each of the two women after squirting them with his plastic toy while they were out shopping.

Wilson, who runs an internet marketing business from his home in Blackburn, Lancashire, was said to have crept up behind his victims in broad daylight.

He then pulled on the plastric trigger and 'shot' them in the back with his loaded gun.

At Blackburn Magistrates' Court, Wilson pleaded guilty to two charges of common assault.

The court heard that, when the incident 
took place, his relationship with his Dutch wife had broken down and he was
suffering from a mental breakdown.

But Wilson also told officers he could offer 'no explanation' for his bizarre behaviour.

The incident took place at around 2pm on October 25 last year while Wilson was walking through Blackburn town centre.

Wilson walked up behind both victims and sprayed their clothing, the court was told.

Officers from Lancashire Police arrested Wilson when the two distressed women reported being sprayed with an 'unknown substance'.

One of the victims was aged 28. The other woman's age is unknown.

Officers arrested Wilson nearby and carried out forensic tests to establish what was in the plastic pistol.

Police believed the motivation behind Wilson's odd assault might have been sexual, but said his mobile phone and computer showed no abnormal behaviour, the court was told.

Wilson also claimed he could offer 'no explanation' for his bizarre conduct.

On his 
website Wilson boasts: 'I design and build all (or most) of my own 
websites and make my own graphics, when I first started back in 2007 I 
thought a HTML document was something you filled out at the social 
security office and that PHP was something you rubbed on a wound LOL.

'If
 you have any questions please feel free to contact me via the page 
provided and I'll do my best to answer them for you. Most 
important...Have A Great Day.'

Today, visitors who downloaded material from Wilson's website were greeted 
with the message: 'WaaaaHaaaahahahaha! I bet you feel a right **** now 
don't you.

'That's what you get when you try stealing images from this site. BTW Have a great day :).'

In court, Wilson was given a conditional discharge for three months.

He was ordered by magistrates to pay £50 compensation to each of his victims. The court also ordered his water pistol to be confiscated.

The court 
heard Wilson - who said he played in a band - had worked for six years 
in Germany and then for 20 years in Holland where he met his wife.

He began his internet marketing business in 2007, advising firms on use the internet to improve their business.

But he suffered a number of family bereavements and, when his long-term marriage had broken down, he had returned to Britain.

Two days after his arrest, Wilson was admitted to the psychiatric unit at Royal Blackburn Hospital where he was treated for three weeks.

In mitigation, his lawyer Imran Hussain said: 'He had suffered from depression and had sought help with that in both Holland and the UK.

'He is deeply ashamed of what he did on that day. It was quite bizarre behaviour, with no motivation.

'He is finding it hard to believe he could be capable of this kind of thing.

'He has been having intensive involvement with the mental health services and there have been no further problems.'
