A Sydney teenager may have fled Australia with his three brothers to join the Islamic State (IS) in Syria, but it appears the organisation will have to wait until he's got all his school homework done before he can give them his full attention.

It's anyone's guess what sort of homework he's brushing up on now for the Syrian jihad, however after telling his parents he and his three brothers had won a holiday to Thailand, 17-year-old Mohamed K, also asked one of his teachers for homework to take with him because he didn't want to fall behind in his studies.

The Australian reported that the request may have been a way of covering his tracks, but the boy's actions were so out of character sources close to his family have questioned whether he knew he was travelling to Syria with his brothers at all, and that they may have tricked him into going.

Instead of going on holiday the four left Sydney on November 8 and flew to Thailand before travelling to Turkey, and from there it's believed they crossed into Syria to join IS. 

Known only as the 'K brothers', because The Australian has elected not to name them, the four siblings are aged between 17 to 28 years old. Mohamed K is the youngest of the four. Milad K is the eldest, while the middle boys are Moustafa and Karim.

Mohamed K has been described as intelligent and academic by sources, and a teenager who was studying for the HSC at a high school in south-western Sydney.

However, a Facebook comment he made on a memorial page for married couple Yusuf and Amira Ali who were killed in Syria in January, suggests that he had sympathy with radical Islam.

'His (sic) a winner at the end of the day im (sic) so proud of him. Wish i had the chance to go yo (sic) syria,' he said.

They have left behind a shocked and bewildered family in Sydney. Their father has still no any idea why the seemingly mild-mannered and friendly quartet should have made such a decision.

'I can't tell you mate, it's very bad,' Mr K told The Weekend Australian. '(My wife) is crying day and night.

'My kids never played in the street, from year one. They was indoor. What happened there? I don't know.'

The youngest Mohamed K may have only been a student, but Mr K said that the eldest brother Milad had given up an $80,000-a-year job with RMS, and had separated from his fiancee who he had planned to marry next month, to go to Syria instead.  

The two other brothers Moustafa and Karim were unemployed. A fifth brother is still living in Australia. 

Police are believed to be closing in on the contact who organised the brothers' trip and made the initial introductions to the IS.

The move may just have been a way of not attracting any attention before fleeing to Syria with his three brothers
