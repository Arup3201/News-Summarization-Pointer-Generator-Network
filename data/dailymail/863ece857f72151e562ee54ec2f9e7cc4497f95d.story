Yesterday saw him cheer double-amputee soldier Private Ben McBean, whom he once described as a 'hero', over the finish line at the end of a charity marathon.

Today, Prince Harry was back in action and in the company of another troop of heroes - 23 of the 30 living holders of the Victoria and George Crosses.

The prince was at St Martin-in-the-Fields church in central London, where he was representing Prince Charles, who is the president of the Victoria Cross and George Cross Association, at a poignant service of remembrance.

On his arrival, Prince Harry was greeted by the former royal protection officer who saved his aunt, the Princess Royal, from kidnap 40 years ago.

The Prince spoke with former Metropolitan Police inspector Jim Beaton, who was shot three times as he protected Anne during the failed kidnap bid in 1974, as they attended a special church service to honour Britain’s military and civilian heroes.

Harry walked into the service with Mr Beaton, who received the George Cross for his efforts to protect Anne from kidnapper Ian Ball during the attack in The Mall, central London.

Despite the miserable weather, Harry, who was dapper in a navy blue suit and wore a remembrance poppy in his buttonhole, spent several minutes chatting to veterans and well-wishers outside the church before proceedings got underway.

The prince, a serving soldier himself, has built a reputation for championing military causes - not least because of September's Invictus Games.

The Games, which Harry hopes to make an annual tradition, saw wounded servicemen from nine different countries compete in a host of paralympic sports, among them running, archery and wheelchair rugby.

Today's service comes in the wake of receptions held by the Queen and Prince Charles at Buckingham Palace and St James's - all designed to honour Britain and the Commonwealth's bravest military and civilian heroes.

The men - and women - at today's service all hold either the Victoria or George Cross - the highest accolades for bravery that the UK can bestow.

The Victoria Cross is the oldest and most prestigious of the two and was instituted by Queen Victoria on 29th January 1856 for those who show 'most conspicuous bravery or some daring pre-eminent act of valour or self-sacrifice or extreme devotion to duty in the presence of the enemy'. 

Although the Victoria Cross can only be awarded to members of the British and Commonwealth Armed Forces, the George Cross can be awarded to civilians as well.

Launched by George VI on the 24th September 1940, it was initially intended to recognise the efforts of Londoners attempting to deal with the Blitz but was soon expanded to apply to members of the Armed Forces who display 'gallant conduct in the face of the enemy'.

Decorated: Although not a VC, Harry has decorations of his own - including an Afghanistan campaign medal (L)

Brave: Harry has completed two overseas tours, both in Afghanistan, the latter in an Apache attack helicopter

Prince Harry has been awarded three medals which he proudly wore today.

His Afghanistan campaign medal was awarded in 2008 for his 10-week stint serving on the front line in Helmand Province.

The Queen's Golden Jubilee medal was given to him by his grandmother The Queen in 2002 to mark 50 years since she was crowned.

This was followed by the Diamond Jubilee medal, awarded in 2012 to mark her 60 years on the throne.

Achievement: Pte McBean, who is a double-amputee, had just completed a 31-mile charity run 

Hero: The former Royal Marine was declared a hero by Prince Harry after their first meeting in 2008

Initiative: Prince Harry, seen here during the event, championed the Invictus Games for wounded servicemen

Proud: The Queen was introduced to Corporal Willie Apiata VC (right) at Buckingham Palace yesterday

Sprightly: The Duke of Edinburgh - and the Queen - were on typically sprightly form during yesterday's event

Holders of the two awards meet annually and have done since 1956 when the Victoria Cross and George Cross Association was launched.

Yesterday saw the holders meet the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh at Buckingham Palace and Prince Charles, who is now in Colombia, also held an afternoon tea at St James's.

Harry too is to join the brave men and women for tea and will host a third reception, again at St James's Palace, later this afternoon.

This is the first time he has worked with the organisation, which was headed by the Queen until 2007 when the presidency passed to the Prince of Wales. 

Support: The Queen was president of the Victoria Cross and George Cross Association until 2007 

Important work: The royals pose for a group photograph with all of the Victoria and George Cross heroes

Meeting: Prince Charles also hosted a reception for VC veterans which took place on Monday at St James's
