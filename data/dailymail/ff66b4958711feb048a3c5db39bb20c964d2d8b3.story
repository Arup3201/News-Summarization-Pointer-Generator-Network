An Asda supermarket worker who stole hundreds of pounds in donations after having her head shaved for a cancer charity has walked free from court.

Mother-of-two Sandra Ramsay, 36, of Mow Cop, Staffordshire, took part in the event to support her friend and work colleague Deb Barnett, 43, who beat breast cancer.

The pair, who both worked at Asda, raised £496.49 last November - but instead of giving the cash to the Breast Cancer Care charity, Ramsay kept it for herself.

A court heard she spent the money on presents for her children and lunches out. She also stole £123.21 from the supermarket along with a selection of children’s clothes.

On Friday, she was ordered to pay £650 compensation, and received a 12-month community order after she admitted the thefts at North Staffordshire Magistrates' Court in Newcastle-under-Lyme.

Ramsay was also ordered to carry out 
60 hours of unpaid work and told her to pay £310 court costs. She has now 
been sacked by Asda.

The 
court heard her theft was exposed when she was caught stealing clothes 
and cash from the supermarket and her bosses called the charity to raise
 their concerns.

Steve Knowles, prosecuting, said: ‘The defendant, along with another colleague, took part in a sponsored head shave in November for the Tickled Pink cancer campaign through the Asda Foundation.

'Due to the previous incidents, the store manager phoned the charity to see if the money had been passed on.

'She contacted the Asda Foundation and they confirmed no money had been handed in. The defendant was interviewed. 

'In relation to the sponsorship, she said she collected the money in good faith and had intended to pass it on, but since Christmas she kept dipping into the money for personal reasons, including to buy dinner and presents for her children.

'She said she didn’t go over the top, it was just £10 or £20 at a time but before she knew it, it had gone.’

David Green, defending, said: ‘This is an extremely sad situation in terms of Mrs Ramsay’s personal life. The thefts were of relatively low value and were unsophisticated offences.

‘There was no attempt to place the blame on somebody else. When Mrs Ramsay raised this money for charity, she clearly intended for that money to go to charity.

‘She then gave in to the temptation of having that money and began dipping into it, not to live an extravagant lifestyle, just to buy lunch and some things for her children.

'She said she didn’t go over the top, it was just £10 or £20 at a time but before she knew it, it had gone'

Steve Knowles, prosecuting

‘By the time Mrs Ramsay had recognised what she had done it was too late. She had spent it all and there was no way of putting it back again. She says she feels ashamed and devastated.’

Ramsay was working at Asda’s store in Wolstanton, Staffordshire, when she suggested holding a charity head shave after being inspired by the bravery of her colleague Ms Barnett.

Ms Barnett, of Fenton, had a tumour removed from her breast in 2008 and was given the all-clear last year. Ramsay refused to comment outside court after she was sentenced.
