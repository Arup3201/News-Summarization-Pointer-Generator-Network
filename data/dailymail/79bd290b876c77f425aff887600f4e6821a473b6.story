Perhaps he’d been listening to Handel’s Water Music recently.

Quite what made a busking cellist think it was a good idea to settle a dispute with a rival street performer by hurling a bucket of water at him isn't clear.

But it's certain that he will think twice about doing it again, because he was arrested over the alleged incident.

Striking a wrong chord: A police officer tackles a cellist after the musician threw a bucket of water (right) over a rival busker

Group effort: Members of the public help the police officer calm the cellist down

Penalty notice: The cellist was fined £90 over the incident

The 45-year-old musician got into an unseemly row with a guitar-playing busker after they both started performing on the same pitch.

The guitarist, Paul Scofield, who had a permit to play in Bucky Doo Square in Bridport, Dorset, asked the cellist to move along as it was claimed he had no such licence.

The pair attempted to play over one another while standing a few yards apart, before the man with the cello marched off and reportedly filled up a bucket of water. 

Aftermath: The guitarist dries off after he was drenched by the watery assault

He returned and allegedly hurled the bucket over the stunned guitarist, leaving him wet through.

Bridport PC Scott McGregor witnessed the incident and detained the offender in front of stunned shoppers.

The cellist was later released with a £90 on-the-spot fine.

The guitarist was said to be drenched but afterwards moved into the sun to dry off and carried on playing.

PC McGregor said the cellist had been playing in the square for an hour before he was asked to stop playing by the guitarist.

He said: ‘I was best placed to deal with the situation and stepped in to calm him down.

‘He has now been dealt with by means of a penalty notice.’

Mr Scofield said: ‘I politely asked the cello player to move on because I had a permit to play the square and he continued playing.

‘He said he wasn't moving and asked whether I was going to perform over him.

‘I then began to play my guitar in the same area and it wasn't long before he had chucked water over me.

‘He then said it was obvious I wasn't from the local area. I have played in Bridport at least 10 times in the past and things like this do not happen often.’

Local councillor Daryl Turner, who had been having a chat with PC McGregor, stepped in to help him.

He said: 'I saw and spoke to the cello player a few minutes before it happened.

'He was playing some really nice, quite classical music. I had never seen him before.

'After a while I became aware of this altercation and then a splashing sound.

'With that I saw PC McGregor struggling to bring the cello player to the ground and handcuff him. I stepped in along with somebody else to help hold him down.

'After that I picked up the guy's cello and equipment and took it into the arts centre for safekeeping.

'I saw the guitarist who was soaking wet. He went away, dried off and came back and carried on.

'About an hour later, the cello player came back and he was very calm and he appreciated what we did to him in the end.'

Sarah Cross, who works in a hairdressers nearby, said: ‘The guy with the cello was there first and then another busker came along and asked him to move on.

‘The next thing, I heard a big splash and then saw the policeman and a couple of people tussling with one of the two buskers.

‘I saw the other busker and he was completely drenched. But he just moved into the sun to dry out and carried on playing his guitar.’

One eye witness later wrote on Facebook: ‘I saw it all - a right old dueling banjos and no mistake. I guess the two buskers involved just struck the wrong chord.’

A spokesman for Dorset police confirmed a 45-year-old man had been issued with an on-the-spot fine of £90 for a public order offence.
