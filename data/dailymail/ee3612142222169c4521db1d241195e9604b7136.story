Over 11 years they transformed the fields surrounding their home into one of Britain’s most beautiful gardens.

Doing much of the work themselves, David and Elaine Rolfe spent £20,000 turning the two-acre plot into a lush paradise full of colour, with sweeping flower beds and rose-clad arbours.

But last year Mr Rolfe, 51, was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. It meant the couple had to leave their rented 17th-century water mill, on the Llanover Estate near Abergavenny, Wales, to move into a bungalow.

Green fingers: David and Elaine have been ordered to return the garden to rough pasture - or face paying £5,000 to have it gravelled by the estate owners - after David was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer

Welsh country garden: Elaine and David Rolfe spent the last 11 years turning the scrubland into their treasured garden featured on a Monty Don TV show and in gardening magazines

Attraction: Elaine says gardeners have come from miles around to admire their garden which has even been on the Gardener of the Year show

And yesterday their beloved garden 
was being pulled up, plant by plant, after the couple’s former landlords
told them it had to go – or they would face a £5,000 bill to have it 
dug up and covered with gravel.

The estate’s owners say the garden would be ‘too much’ for new tenants to maintain.

The couple, who have eight children, must now return the garden at 
Grade-II listed Ochran Mill to rough pasture. Yesterday Mrs Rolfe, 50, 
said: ‘It’s heartbreaking to pull the garden up and see all our hard 
work go to nothing. David is too ill to know what is going on, so that 
is a blessing.

‘The garden has been our life’s work and I know it’s given people a lot of pleasure over the years.

Too much? Now the couple have told the garden is so outstanding it would be 'too much' for new tenants to maintain it in its current glory

'Heartbreak': David and Elaine said it was 'heartbreaking' that all their hard work 'was for nothing'

The house: The National Gardens Scheme describes Ochran Mill as 'a Grade II listed water mill (not working) in approx 2-acres'

Pulled up: But the garden was already being pulled up yesterday after Elaine invited her green-fingered friends to help themselves to plants and cuttings before the diggers move in

‘David is coming towards the end, and to receive this demand from our landlords was a shock which we didn’t need right now.’

Mrs Rolfe has enlisted green-fingered friends to begin clearing the 
garden, which has been featured on television, in magazines and was a 
finalist in many competitions. The couple also used to open it to the 
public to raise money for charity.

Friends are collecting cuttings, while horticulturists from Bristol Zoo 
have taken some of the rarer plants. Mrs Rolfe said: ‘If I had the time I
would do it myself, but my husband is so ill I can’t leave him.

‘It’s upsetting they are trying to charge me – it’s very stressful.’

She said she and her husband had always had a good relationship with the
trustees of the Llanover Estate, and that they had encouraged the 
couple to create the garden.

Mr Rolfe, a website designer, was diagnosed with a brain tumour last 
June. Doctors said he could live for five years but his condition 
worsened at the end of last year.

Mrs Rolfe, who is now surviving on benefits, said: ‘It’s hard for all of
us. In many ways the garden is the least of my worries right now.’

James Perks, resident land agent for the Llanover Estate, said: ‘We have
tried to be as sympathetic as we can and to give Mrs Rolfe more time 
but we have to get it [the home] ready for another tenant.’

He confirmed it would cost roughly £5,000 to clear the garden and put 
gravel down. When Mrs Rolfe has removed what she can, this will be 
re-evaluated.

The early days: The doctors said David could live for five years but his condition became serious at the end of last year and the couple could no longer live in the 17th century stone-built mill

Before: The slopey verge before the gardens

After: The slopey verge after one year of planting

Before: The field before the gardens were conceived

Middle: A year into the project. The garden would still take a further ten years to complete

At the end: They claim the estate owners encouraged the couple to create the garden and are fully aware of David's condition
