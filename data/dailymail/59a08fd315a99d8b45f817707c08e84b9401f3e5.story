A gardener has grown a misshapen chilli which bears an uncanny resemblance to a duck.

Keith Rogers took this picture of the chilli after becoming frustrated that shoppers cause masses of food waste by refusing to buy misshapen vegetables.

The 79-year-old, of Hartlepool, is a keen grower of vegetables and says he prefers unconventional looking ones to those that are perfectly shaped.

His picture comes as Tesco bosses claim UK customers always pick the 'cream of the crop', forcing the shop to bin thousands of misshapen fruit and vegetables every year.

Former sweet shop owner Mr Rogers, 79, thinks the firm should set up a special stall in their shops and sell misshapen vegetables half price.

Mr Rogers, who lives with his wife Maureen, said: 'I grew this pepper in my garden, I grow lots of vegetables.

'It is a bit of fun and it made me laugh because it looked like a duck, but why would you not want to eat it?

'I totally agree with Tesco, it's ridiculous that people turn their noses up at mishapen fruit and veg - and actually they usually taste better.

'The waste is appalling. It's ridiculous that people just want to eat perfect produce, there is no reason behind it.

'If I get a carrot with three legs I think "bonus". There is no way I would ever bin a vegetable for being a funny shape.

'I have a friend who grows cauliflower and he says that if they come out with a slightly yellow tinge, then although they are absolutely fine to eat, then the supermarkets won't take them.

'Sometimes he has to bin a whole field's worth. It's scandalous.'
