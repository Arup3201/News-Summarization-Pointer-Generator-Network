A 'detoother' isn't a doctor but a gold-digger and a 'side-dish' certainly isn't something served by a waiter - it's a mistress.

These, along with phrases such as 'spewing out buffalos' - which means that you can't speak proper English - are just a few examples of Uganda's unusual, locally-adapted language called 'Uglish.'

And for the first time, the unusual Ugandan version of adapted English is set to be published in dictionary form.

Uglish, a popular, locally-adapted English language will be published in dictionary form for the first time

'It is so entrenched right now that, even when you think you cannot use it, you actually find yourself speaking Uglish,' Bernard Sabiiti, the author of the first Uglish dictionary, told AFP.

'Even as I was researching, I was surprised that these words are not English because they were the only ones I knew. 

'A word like a 'campuser' - a university student - I used to think was an English word.'

Uglish: A Dictionary of Ugandan English, which went on sale in bookshops across the east African country late last year, contains hundreds of popular Uglish terms, some coined by Ugandans as far back as the colonial period.

Author of the first Uglish dictionary, Bernard Sabiiti, used to this 'campuser' - a university student - was actually a real English word

Sabiiti, 32, said the informal phrases were greatly influenced by the local Luganda language, and is a 'symptom of a serious problem with our education system' that he claims has been deteriorating since the 1990s.

Uglish is largely dependent on sentences being literally translated from local dialects with little regard for context, while vocabulary used is derived from standard English.

Meantime, Sabiiti says, influence from the Internet, local media and musicians have seen additional words and phrases created and slowly enter the lexicon.

The result is colourful but at times confusing expressions. 

The language is pervasive in all parts of the country, resulting in colourful, confusing expressions

If you haven't seen someone for a while, for example, you're 'lost', while if you 'design well', you are snappy dresser.

Today, Uglish is used by people from all walks of life, but particularly popular with youths.

However, English is still the country's working language, and it remains the only medium of instruction in schools and in official business.

But Sabiiti said everyone from the president to simple farmers speak at least some Uglish, which varies according to region, tribe and gender, and is regularly seen on signposts.

'MPs are almost notorious at using Uglish, you see it in parliamentary debates,' said Sabiiti. 

It's so prevalent, in fact, that it's even used in Parliament! MPs are notorious for using Uglish in debates

But it wasn't until 2011, a year after the term Uglish - pronounced 'You-glish' - had been coined on social media, that Sabiiti began keeping newspaper cuttings, conducting interviews and searching online for material for his book.

'I knew that people talked a lot about this, and my friends used to laugh about it,' said the author, who also works for a think tank, which often takes him to the far reaches of the country.

His book contains a brief history of Uglish, and a glossary of terms relating to education, telecommunications, society and lifestyle, food, transport, sex and relationships.

One phrase commonly used when discussing the latter is 'live sex,' which means unprotected sex - a term thought to have derived from the live European football games Ugandans love to watch.

'When the ministry of health is doing campaigns to warn young people against unprotected sex, they use 'live sex', because everybody will understand it,' said Sabiiti.

On the same subject, if you're a 'side-dish', you are someone's mistress.

Following the dictionary's release, so many more phrases have been suggested that Sabiiti has decided to do a second edition

Sabiiti's book has proven popular among the middle class, including academics, and with locals and foreigners alike. 

To date he's sold about a thousand copies.

'I've had incredible feedback from professional linguists, ordinary readers - some even suggesting more phrases - so I'll be doing another edition,' said Sabiiti.

'I don't see it disappearing. I'm looking forward to seeing five years from now how many new words and phrases have joined the lexicon,' he said, adding some teachers, particularly in state schools, are passing Uglish on to their students.

Though English is the country's language of instruction, Uglish is extremely popular with young people

But, as the author stresses in the final chapter of his book, there comes a point when Uglish stops being funny.

In 1997 Uganda introduced universal primary school education, which eliminated official school fees and made education accessible to millions more children.

But literacy rates remain low: more than a quarter of the population cannot read or write, according to the UN, and critics say standards remain low in many schools.

'Uglish is not something that should be encouraged, particularly for young, impressionable children,' he concluded.

'They really should learn what they call proper standard English.'
