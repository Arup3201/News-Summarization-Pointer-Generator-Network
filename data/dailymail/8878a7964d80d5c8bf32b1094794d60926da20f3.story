The Prime Minister lived up to his laid back reputation this weekend by spending a low key Saturday night cooking lamb chops for his mother.

David Cameron was spotted purchasing the lamb cutlets from the local butcher near the Prime Minister's official country residence Chequers on Saturday afternoon.

Downing Street said he bought ten chops from A Cobb butchers in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire ahead of his mother Mary's visit for dinner Saturday night.

Mr Cameron's visit tied in with Small Business Saturday - an initiative designed to encourage people to use local shops and businesses.

'Small businesses are the lifeblood of our country - essential for building a resilient, sustainable economy and a central part of my long-term economic plan for Britain,' Mr Cameron said.

'They account for 99 in every 100 businesses and keep more than 11 million people in work so this isn't about sentimentality, it's about the future of Britain, creating jobs and turning our economy around.

'I'm determined that we back them in every way we can - that's what today is all about and that's what this Government is about.'

Many MPs took to social media to promote businesses in their constituencies.

Meanwhile Ed Miliband bought gifts for his sons, Daniel and Sam, at the Bookseller Crow as he toured shops in Crystal Palace and bread and ham from nearby Good Taste Food and Drink.

It comes after the government announced measures to help small businesses, including faster broadband and moves to tackle late payments.

The announcement is aimed at removing some of the barriers faced by small businesses, such as accessing faster and better broadband connectivity and making it easier to switch energy suppliers.

Business Secretary Vince Cable said: 'I meet with small businesses regularly who tell me about what Government support works well and what doesn't. Through our commitment to small firms we are directly addressing that feedback, freeing them from unnecessary burdens, providing more finance and improving access to advice and support.

'In particular we are tackling the issue of late payment, which can threaten the survival of otherwise healthy businesses. We are enforcing prompt payment through the entire public sector and asking what more we can do to get credit flowing in the private sector.'

Enterprise and skills minister Matthew Hancock said: 'Small businesses are the lifeblood of the British economy and responsible for nearly half the job creation in the UK. That's why we are removing barriers to growth and supporting them, so that they can create jobs and compete in the global race.'

Dr Adam Marshall, director of policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: 'The Government is right to say that Britain is a great place to start a business. Now it needs to become a great place to grow a business too. That means ensuring that fast-growing and dynamic small companies get access to the capital they need to expand, and access to practical business-to-business support to break into new markets around the world.'

Terry Scuoler, chief executive of the manufacturers organisation the EEF, said: 'Small businesses are a vital part of the economy and we need to make it easier for them to invest, grow and create the highly skilled innovative jobs our economy needs.

'The more we can grow into larger medium size companies, the better for UK plc. In order to enable this we need to examine every means to removing some of the barriers they face, improving the business environment and making it easier for them to fulfil their potential.'

John Cridland, CBI director general, said: 'Small and medium-sized businesses are at the heart of communities across the UK and are the job-creating dynamos of the recovery.

'Small Business Saturday is a great way for people up and down the country to back their local high street in the run-up to Christmas and I would encourage everyone to get involved.'
