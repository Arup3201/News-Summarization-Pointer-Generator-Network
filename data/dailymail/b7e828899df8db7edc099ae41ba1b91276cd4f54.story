Luis Suarez cannot wait to make his Champions League debut for Barcelona after missing out on playing in the competition during his time at Liverpool.

The Uruguay striker has returned from serving a four-month ban for biting Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup and will play his first game for Barcelona in Europe against former club Ajax on Wednesday.

The 27-year-old did not play in Europe's elite competition during the three seasons he spent at Anfield, but is excited about returning with a side that are among the favourites to win the trophy.

Speaking to adidas Gamedayplus, Suarez said: 'It's incredible, after many years at Liverpool without playing in the Champions League now it's great to be part of a team that has a good chance of winning. It's beautiful.' 

Suarez also revealed that he has struck up a close relationship with Lionel Messi - thanks largely to their South American roots. 

'My relationship with Messi is good. He's an Argentinian, so we got on very well from the beginning. He drinks mate as we do in Uruguay and all that,' he said.

Before moving to Anfield, Suarez did play in the Champions League with Ajax - where he scored his 100th career goal in the competition - and is looking forward to visiting his former club.

'I spent many years there, my family was very content there, very happy. Having an opportunity to play there again will be beautiful, I will enjoy it very much,' he added. 

Suarez has warned Barcelona not to give Edinson Cavani (L) a chance when they face Paris St Germain

As well as Ajax and APOEL, Barcelona's Group F also features Paris Saint Germain where Suarez will face his international compatriot Edinson Cavani for the first time.

He said: 'I have never played against him, but everyone knows how good he is. His ability in the penalty area and he's a great goalscorer - so we must be very careful because if he gets a chance he won't miss it.'
