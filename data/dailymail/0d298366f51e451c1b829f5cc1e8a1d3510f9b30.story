Polar air sweeping down from Canada is causing heavy downpours and bringing record-breaking cold weather in parts of the U.S..

A massive southern dip in the jet stream is forcing cold air from the Arctic as far south as Kentucky, and will bring daytime highs of no more than 15C and overnight lows of just 4C to parts of the Midwest in the early half of this week.

Yesterday the city of Duluth, Minnesota saw a midday high of 13C accompanied by a bitter 20mph wind at a time of year when temperatures would usually be in the high 20s or low 30s.

Floods: A car is seen driving through a flooded street in Chicago. Several inches of rain fell in just a few hours in the area over the weekend, with temperatures plummeting as a result of the cold air being forced into the U.S. from the Arctic

Temperatures across parts of eastern and central U.S. will be more reminiscent of late October or early November this week, as the dip in the jet stream forces cold Arctic air much deeper into the country than it normally would.Â 

According to the National Weather Service, the weather in Minnesota's Twin Cities - Minneapolis and Saint Paul - was record-breakingly cold yesterday.

With a high of just 18C, yesterday's cold weather smashed the Twin Cities' previous record for a July 14 temperature. The previous July 14 record of 20C had stood for an astonishing 130 years, since 1884.

Despite the poor weather conditions it is not, however, the second coming of a polar vortex, a phrase the 
National Weather Service's Chicago office tweeted earlier this week to 
describe the upcoming sweater weather.

They quickly learned that wasn't 
such a good idea, said Amy Seeley, a weather service meteorologist who 
spent a good chunk of Friday morning fielding a flood of telephone calls
 from the media.

'I think people are pretty sensitive to those words,' she said.

Divide: The current cold weather in the U.S. has its roots in an Asian typhoon. Though Typhoon Neoguri has weakened since hitting Japan, it altered the path of the North Pacific jet stream, allowing polar air behind a trough of low pressure to spill out of Canada and into the Midwest. The cold air has, however, forced warm winds from Mexico much further north than usual, leaving cities such as Seattle on the Pacific coast basking in the mid-30s

Under water: Several grave sites at the Chico Basin Cemetery rest under water after a severe thunderstorm dumped several inches of rain and strong winds in Hanover, Colorado over the weekend. The area is experiencing extreme weather thanks to disruption in the North Pacific jet stream

The current cold weather in the U.S. has 
its roots in a Asian typhoon. Though Typhoon Neoguri has weakened since 
hitting Japan, it altered the path of the North Pacific jet stream, 
allowing polar air behind a trough of low pressure to spill out of 
Canada and into the Midwest.

In the early half of this week, temperatures in the Midwest will be as much as 15 degrees cooler than normal, with the biggest drops seen close to the Great Lakes, though people in Oklahoma and Arkansas will feel the chill as well.

The North Pacific jet stream, which is also known as the polar jet stream, is a fast flowing narrow air current which has a significant impact on the weather in Asia, North America and Europe.

Although it is usually stable and relatively easy to predict, typhoons or severe storms - most frequently in Asia - can easily disrupt the flow, causing the sort of extreme weather currently hitting North America.

The cold 
weather in much of the country is in stark contrast to the Pacific 
Northwest however, where temperatures will actually be significantly 
higher than usual - again caused by the disruption to the North Pacific 
jet stream.

Seattle,
 where summers are typically warm but rarely scorching, will see daytime
 highs in the mid to upper 30s as the week goes on.

Meanwhile visitors to the Rocky Mountain National Park are hiking more cautiously after lightning strikes at the popular park killed two people in two days at the height of summer travel season.

Signs around the park warn its three million annual visitors that storms can close in quickly with deadly results but the areas hadn't seen a lightning fatality in 14 years until last week.

Rebecca
 Teilhet, 42, of Yellow Springs, Ohio, was killed and seven more hikers 
were injured on the Ute Crossing Trail at about 11,400 feet above sea 
level.

One day later and a few miles away, lightning killed Gregory 
Cardwell, 52, of Scottsbluff, Nebraska, at Rainbow Curve, a pullout on 
Trail Ridge Road with sweeping vistas from a vantage point about 10,800 
feet above sea level. Three others were hurt by that strike.
