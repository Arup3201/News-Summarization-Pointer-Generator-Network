Leaders in a small North Dakota town have approved a bill that prevents any new construction to take place in a move to prevent an neo-Nazi from building a 'white-only' community.

Craig Cobb has bought a home and 12 other lots in Leith and is encouraging others who want to build an Aryan enclave with him to move there and help him take control of the community.

The white supremacist says the new law unfairly targets him.

The Bismarck Tribune reports that city
officials are working on an ordinance that will require Cobb to install
water and sewer service in his house, where three other male white 
supremacists and two children also are living.

Another
ordinance would prevent tents and campers from being on a city lot for 
more than 10 consecutive days. Cobb calls the proposals 'patently 
unfair'.

The new ordinances will require Cobb to put water and sewer into his house, where three other white male supremacists and two young children are also living with space heaters and no working furnace.

Under the ordinance, anyone without water and sewer will have 30 days to come into compliance, or face fines or possible condemnation.

The city also approved a moratorium that prevents any new building until planning and zoning is put into place.

Supremacist's paradise: Craig Cobb, 61, has invited dozens of neo-Nazi leaders to Leith to start to haven for racist hate groups

Craig Cobb, a self-described white supremacist, had already bought several homes and properties in Leith when he moved to the town 75 miles southwest of Bismark last year.

He had bought at least a dozen properties and given several of them to leaders of major neo-Nazi hate groups.

Often, he paid just hundreds or a few thousand dollars absentee owners who had long ago fled Leith and left their properties in disrepair.

He has grand visions for the town and is determined to revitalize it.

He told National Public Radio: 'It would be extraordinarily beautiful when people enter the town, particularly at night because we will have floodlit flags from both the bottom and the top of all the formerly white nations of the earth.

'We will probably have the National Socialist hunting flag with stag horns and a very small swastika in the center, very discreet.'

Ramshackle: Leith has just 24 residents. It has been in a slow decline for decades. Cobb bought most of the properties for just hundreds or a few thousand dollars

He plans parks and monuments and a municipal swimming pool, all named after white-power activists.

But the Cobb and his white supremacist ilk have one immediate obstacle to their all-white paradise in Leith: Bobby Harper, the town's only black resident.

'I'm not leaving,' Harper told NPR.

'They gotta do something very, very drastic to me to make it unsafe and uncomfortable for me. Right now, I don't see it happening.'

The U.S. National Socialist Movement, America's largest whiteÂ  supremacist group, is joining forces with Cobb and is calling its members to Leith for a meeting on Sunday and Monday.

'We have every intention of legally assuming control of the local government,' Socialist Movement leader Jeff Schoep said in a statement.

Cobb moved to Leith from Montana and has purchased about a dozen homes and vacant parcels of land

According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, Cobb wants to set up a 'Pioneer Little Europe.'

In
an interview with WXMB-TV in Bismarck, Cobb said he had gotten a lot of
offers to buy up land from what he termed like-minded people who 
believe white people should not be punished for wanting to live near 
each other.

'It's fine for all these other minorities, but not us,' he said in the televised interview. 'If you merely speak about it, you're going to be defamed in this country.'

Cobb was arrested in 2010 in Canada on federal charges of willful promotion of hatred.

He was living in Montana under dual citizenship until his arrival in Grant County.

He began to buy properties from absentee owners for a few hundred dollars each.

When county court employees asked Cobb why he was buying so many, incredibly Cobb said he was aiming to rename the town 'Cobbsville', according to Tax Director Muriel Ulrich.
