So it wasn't the quiet night Brendan Rodgers wanted. With the League Cup back on the agenda, Liverpool's manager expressed his wish for 'something less eventful' than last month's drama against Middlesbrough.

What he got was anything but. Though there was no epic penalty shootout on this occasion, the spectacle was no less enthralling as Liverpool managed to extricate themselves from a bleak position against 10-man Swansea, turning a 1-0 deficit into a 2-1 win in injury time.

And it was thanks, in no small part, to Mario Balotelli. Yes, him. For once, Liverpool's enigmatic striker came up trumps when it was required, finding himself in the right place at the right time to convert a searching Fabio Borini cross, seven minutes after coming on as substitute.

Balotelli was only on the field 16 minutes in total but that did not stop him becoming a key figure in the narrative, even managing to get involved in a jostling match with Jonjo Shelvey after Dejan Lovren had risen highest at the back post to score  the winner.

Rodgers, for good reason, was sheepish as his players celebrated in front of the exultant Kop, appreciating that his side had benefitted from the harsh sending-off of Federico Fernandez for a robust challenge on Philippe Coutinho, that led to the free-kick from which Lovren scored.

In the other technical area, Garry Monk – Rodgers' former captain at Swansea – was incandescent at the decision; that his side had frittered away a place in the last eight after looking set to cruise through following Marvin Emnes 65th-minute opener added salt to the wound.

For Rodgers and Balotelli, however, this was a welcome change of fortune. A second defeat to a team wearing all-white at Anfield in the space of week, after Real Madrid's brutal lesson in the Champions League, would have set the alarm bells ringing but, perhaps, this is what they needed.

'That is Mario,' said Rodgers' assistant Colin Pascoe. 'He is working hard and he got his just rewards. He nearly missed the game because he felt his knee in the warm up, so it was a good thing we had him. But I never thought we were out of it. I thought we were unfortunate to be 1-0 down.'

Monk, unsurprisingly, did not agree. Once they overcame a sluggish start, Swansea, inspired by Shelvey's drive, determination and use of the ball, impressed in the second half and should have taken advantage of Liverpool's frailities when Emnes put them in front.

'I am disappointed at the end,' said Monk. 'Hopefully (referee Keith Stroud) will rescind the red card. These decisions are happening, we have to take it on the chin. The players are upset with the decision, upset with the goal but we should have taken that into extra time.

'We should be clever enough to deal with that. We didn't deserve that. I'm not talking rubbish, I'm talking sense. I was emotional at Stoke, I'm emotional again but it is not getting me anywhere. I watched it about 30 times before I came into talk to you. I hope he will rescind that.'

Even if Stroud does, it will be scant consolation. Swansea were so close to repeating the trick they pulled at this stage of the competition two years ago and only naivety cost them. Until then, they had coped with everything Liverpool had thrown at them. 

Liverpool's play in the opening period was nice enough but lacked punch and only Fabio Borini looked capable of breaking the deadlock; he had the two best efforts, one with a left-foot drive that fizzed past the post, the other forced a fine save from Gerhard Tremmel.

Part of Liverpool's problems in recent weeks has been how they have lost their way in games when things have not gone as they would have wanted them to, so this was going to be a test of their character as much as anything else. Swansea sensed as much.

A sense the tide was turning arrived on the hour when, from another precise Shelvey corner, Bafetimbi Gomis wriggled away from Lovren and thumped a header straight at Jones. It was a sign of things to come.

Moments later, Shelvey again started driving Swansea forward but when his ball was cut out, Neil Taylor latched on to it and ushered it forward into the path of Emnes, who had taken full advantage of the fact Lovren had gone to sleep.

With plenty of time and space, Emnes took gleeful delight in thumping a volley beyond the exposed Jones to send the visting hordes wild and push Rodgers and Company to a place were they had to begin considering the impact of what defeat would have on their season.

Then came the grandstand finish. First Balotelli, on for Rickie Lambert, came good, turning in Fabio Borini's cross before one final attack culminated with Lovren peeling off at the back post and turning in his header, atoning for his earlier mistake.

Rodgers afforded himself a small smile but nothing more. They are into the last eight and his ambition to win silverware is intact. It isn't getting any easier.
