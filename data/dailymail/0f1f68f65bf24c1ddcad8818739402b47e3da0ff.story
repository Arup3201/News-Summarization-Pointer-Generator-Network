If right-wingers catch the wave of an election blowout on Tuesday, four GOP candidates could tilt the scales of diversity in their favor – including one openly gay man whose campaign has been forced to deny that he has exposed himself to staffers and masturbated in public places.

Two Republicans aim to join South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott as the only blacks from their party in Congress. 

Mia Love, a Haitian-American former mayor of Saratoga Springs, Utah, failed in her first attempt to win a congressional seat in 2012, losing to a Democratic incumbent by just 768 votes out of more than 245 cast.

This time she's fighting to win an open seat, and polls are tilted in her favor.

In Texas, former CIA undercover operative Will Hurd is in a pitched battle against first-term Democrat Pete Gallego in an expansive majority-Hispanic district that winds 830 miles from San Antonio to El Paso.

The last black U.S. House Republican was retired U.S. Army Lt. Col. Allen West, who won in the 2010 tea party landslide but was defeated two years later.

Democrats have long-enjoyed the perception among African-Americans that they should be the default recipient of blacks' votes – largely, conservatives say, because the Great Society programs inaugurated by Democratic President Lyndon Johnson, and enlarged under Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, benefit blacks through a massive government welfare system.

But while today's black civil rights leaders cite a history of racism and discrimination as the primary reason to elect Democrats, they tend to downplay the fact that the original black civil rights icon, President Abraham Lincoln, was a Republican.

Most of the Deep South's historically loathsome 20th Century segregationists were Democrats.

Two openly gay Republicans could also join their states' congressional delegation in Washington, D.C.

Richard Tisei in Massachusetts lost his 2012 race against longtime incumbent Democrat John Tierney. This time, however, Tierney was upset in the primary by a little-known Marine Corps veteran, Seth Moulton.

The lack of an incumbent could tip the scales in Tisei's favor. He's a former Minority Leader in the Massachusetts State Senate who also lost a 2010 bid for lieutenant governor.

Three time zones away in San Diego, California, openly gay Carl DeMaio is challenging one-term incumbent Scott Peters in a race that every major polling organization rates as a toss-up.

But DeMaio would likely be leading if it weren't for a trio of sexual-misconduct accusations that are giving some voters second thoughts.

His campaign has issued firm denials to all of them. 

ELECTION DAY: Americans are voting in every state on Tuesday, with implications that will shape the last two years of the Obama presidency and public policy that could stretch decades into the future

OUT: Republican candidate for Congress Richard Tisei hopes to up the GOP's diversity quotient, but Democratic homosexuals would still outnumber Republicans in Congress

BAY STATE MADE HISTORY: Massachusetts Rap. Gerry Studds (left0 was the first openly gay member of Congress, and Barney Frank weathered snarks and cruel jokes until 2013 as a congressman from the same state – but was once embroiled in a rent-boy scandal involving his housemate's 'side business'

On Oct. 10 CNN broke a story about a former campaign staffer who said he caught DeMaio masturbating in his office in April.

'I came over to his office, door was open. And he was masturbating,' DeMaio's former policy director Todd Bosnich said.

'I saw his hand, his penis in his hand, and he had a smile on his face. And as soon as I came over he was looking at me.'

Two days ago a second campaign worker made a similar allegation in an interview with KPBS. 

'I was at the urinal, and (DeMaio) came from the stall that was closest to the urinal and was kind of just standing there hovering,' former regional political director Justin Harper claimed. 

'I turned around and realized that it was Carl. He had his pants up, but his fly was undone, and he had his hand over, not over, grasping his genitals.'

A former San Diego City Council colleague has told CNN that he witnessed DeMaio masturbating in the city hall bathroom on two occasions.

It's unclear whether the October Surprise revelations will be enough to doom DeMaio.

A California Republican Party aide told MailOnline on background that 'we hope voters are smart enough to see that this is a mean-spirited effort by disgruntled former employees. If anyone made these accusations about a Democrat, they would be pilloried as homophobic and prejudiced.'
