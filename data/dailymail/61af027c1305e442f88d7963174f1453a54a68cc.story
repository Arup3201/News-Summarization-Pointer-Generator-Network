Pressure: Sir David Nicholson was in charge of the regional health authority responsible for Mid Staffs when 'the appalling and unnecessary suffering of people' took place - but will not resign

Civil servants 'neutered' the Francis report into 1,200 deaths at the Mid Staffordshire hospital trust to protect the Head of the NHS over his role in Britain’s worst-ever health scandal, an expert said today.

Professor Brian Jarman, who was a key figure in highlighting sky-high death rates at Stafford, said the final version of the £13million report was 'muted' and failed to mention criticisms of Sir David Nicholson given in evidence.

Sir David, dubbed the man with no shame, is under huge pressure to leave his role after presiding over the Mid Staffordshire scandal.

Many MPs, relatives of the 1,200 dead and health service professionals believe patient care will not improve under his leadership, but the NHS chief executive maintains there is no chance he will resign.

Robert Francis QC's damning 1,782 page report shocked Britain after it found ‘failures at every level’ which led to the scandal, while not a single nurse or doctor has been disciplined or struck-off.

Patients at Stafford Hospital were left lying in their own urine and excrement for days, forced to drink water from vases, given the wrong medication or sent home with life-threatening conditions.

'I feel the final report was muted. The 2010 report and the closing submissions to the Francis inquiry were much clearer with regards to the evidence,' Professor Jarman told the Daily Telegraph.

'You have to remember that the final version of these inquiries are written up by Department of Health officials. They neutered it.

Although Professor Jarman admits it is  
'difficult to prove' Whitehall was seeking to protect Sir David 
Nicholson, he added: 'I think it probably has the effect of protecting 
him.'

Professor Jarman claims that the report only briefly mentioned an allegation that Sir David told hospital regulators to ignore campaign group Cure the NHS, set up by family and friends of those who died at unnecessarily Stafford.

Tomorrow Sir David will come under further pressure when he appears before MPs on the Health Select Committee.

They are expected to ask him why he ignored warnings from relatives 
about Mid Staffordshire a year before the scandal came to light.

The Francis report was put together with the help of civil servant Alan Robson, the inquiry's secretary.  Disagreeing with Professor Jarman, Peter Watkin Jones, Solicitor to the Inquiry, said, ’To suggest that the report was “neutered” by “mandarins” is wholly wrong. The Department of Health was not given a draft of the report and therefore did not “write up” the final or any version of it. The decisions about what went into the report were the Chairman’s. Alan Robson was seconded from his job at the Department of Health and acted entirely independently of the Department as Secretary to the Inquiry.’

A spokesman for Robert Francis QC said that Professor Jarman's allegations were 'unfounded concerns'.

'The report was written by the Chairman with the editorial support of his inquiry team,' the spokesman said.

'This team included the Secretary to the Inquiry who was seconded on a full time basis from the Department of Health to work for the inquiry, but who has acted throughout independently of the Department, and subject to the instructions and decisions of the Chairman.

'The Department of Health was not given any draft of the report and therefore did not “write up” the final or any version of the report. The decisions about what went into the report were the Chairman’s.'

Sir David has faced growing calls to resign since a report criticised him for his role in the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal, where up to 1,200 died needlessly. 

Last Thursday, for the first time since the report was published three weeks ago, he met directors from the NHS Commissioning Board.

Families of patients who suffered poor care at Mid Staffordshire had attended the meeting in the hope that Sir David would be given a vote of no-confidence.

But they left the room when the chairman of the board, Professor Malcolm Grant, made it very clear that Sir David would be staying in his £211,000-a-year post.

Earlier, when Sir David was asked if there was any chance he would resign, he defiantly replied ‘no’.

Addressing the meeting later, he said: ‘As many of you know I’m very passionate about improving services for patients.

'I’m very ambitious about the NHS and what that sometimes turns into is intolerance of poor performance which results in the kind of response “Just get it right” when actually we need to be more reflective, think about why people are doing the things they do.

'Patient safety is the top of the tree. We need zero tolerance of failures of patient safety.’

Sir David was in charge of the regional body supposedly overseeing Mid Staffordshire but which failed to pick up on the horrific standards of care.

As chief executive of the Department of Health, he is said to have dismissed warnings from relatives of patients who died, saying they were ‘simply lobbying.’

A group of 20 members of Cure the NHS staged a silent protest outside the building in Manchester where the meeting was held.

Some carried placards with the words ‘The man with no shame’ while others held up pictures of a gravestone with the words ‘Too many deaths, no accountability’.

Julie Bailey, 51, who founded the group after her mother Bella died at the trust said: ‘Our long campaign for a public inquiry into what happened at Stafford Hospital will have been pointless if this man remains in charge of the NHS.

‘He’s part of the problem, and while he’s still there we have no faith that the health service will be led towards the caring culture it needs.’
