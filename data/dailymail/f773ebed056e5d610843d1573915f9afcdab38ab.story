Playing in two World Cups and running out for Leeds United and Liverpool, former Socceroo Harry Kewell is used to the big stage - and they don't come much bigger than humpback whales.

The 36-year-old star, who recently retired from the sport, took the day off from coaching duties to join the 40-tonne creatures in a specially guided tour off Hervey Bay, along Queensland's south east coast.  

Ticking off a life-long goal to go swimming with whales, the two-time World Cup player said it was a thrill to join the 16-metre monsters of the deep he'd only ever researched while watching whale documentaries.

Usually the one being photographed from the field, Kewell was doing some happy snapping of his own on board the Queen Cat II as he watched the playful whales play with their new born calves. 

'Obviously I've watched a lot of documentaries about them but to see them up close and personal is fantastic and we've been treated to a great show today.'

Kewell was visiting the Fraser Coast, one of a number of regional locations the former Liverpool star has been stopping off at as part of his national coaching tour.

The children's clinic will see him give grass roots footballers the same opportunities he had growing up with the sport, and this latest trip has given him an added personal highlight away from the footballing pitch.

The guided tour gave Kewell the chance to go snorkelling with marine life and mix with 'nature at its best.'

'It's just a shame my kids aren't here,' he lamented on the tour.

'But it gives me an opportunity to come back to Hervey Bay and take them out to actually see this again...this is something that is amazing.' 

The day off allowed Kewell to tick off a life long dream of swimming with whales

Now is the peak season to go whale watching in Australia with humpbacks topping to play with their new borns

A former Socceroo and footballing journeyman, Kewell played in two World Cups and represented at the elite level for top-flight English clubs Leeds United, Liverpool, and Turkish team Galatasaray before returning home to Australia to play for the Melbourne Heart.

He was recently voted by fans, players and journalists as Australia's best ever footballer in April and is now enjoying post-footballing roles as a children's clinic coach.

He said he is enjoying affording Australia's future stars the same opportunities he had as a young footballer.

'I've come up here to give the kids a taste of what it's like to become a footballer and to give them a bit of an insight,' he says. 

The whale watching experience takes place from July to October each year while humpbacks whales stop to rest and play in the protected waters off Hervey Bay.  

This is the peak whale watching period as humpbacks, accompanied by their new-born calves, stop to enjoy the warmer waters of the north.
