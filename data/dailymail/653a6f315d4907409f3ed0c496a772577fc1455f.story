A council manager in charge of allocating money to improve disabled people’s homes stole more than £117,000 - to carry out DIY on his own house.

Stephen Parry, 57, was caught out using council funds when colleagues spotted that he was buying gardening equipment from B&Q for homes that didn’t have gardens.

Parry was jailed for 20 months at Bristol Crown Court for stealing a total of £117,000 from Bristol City Council to do up his £300,000 home in Wells, Somerset.

He had worked as a technical team leader in the minor adaptations team of Bristol City Council’s independent living service for 10 years.

William Hunter, prosecuting, told the court Parry supervised five technicians and was responsible for allocating work, arranging contracts and buying materials and tools in order to carry out minor adaptions of up to £1,000 to adult disabled people’s homes.

But in August last year, Parry’s purchase of gardening equipment and a set of headphones was noticed.

Police called in searched his home and found gardening equipment, decorating items and BT phones.

Parry told police he had been buying things either for himself or to sell on eBay - boosting his income by £350 a week.

He was only caught out when the council realised he was buying gardening equipment from B&Q and his team didn’t do gardening.

Parry admitted six counts of theft of gardening equipment, electrical items, tools, office equipment and clothes.

Judge Martin Picton told him: 'These offences are very serious. Thefts took place over a long period of time and the victims are the council tax payers.

'It is a lot of money and a gross breach of trust placed In you.'

Though Parry said his thefts totalled £108,000, the prosecution’s calculation came to £117,000.

Another future hearing will be held to try and retrieve the money under the Proceeds of Crime Act (POCA).
