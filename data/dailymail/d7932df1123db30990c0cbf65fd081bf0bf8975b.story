Splash out on a jet-ski, learn to play the guitar and knit – that is how to beat the recession blues, according to a self-help guru created by new Tory chairman Grant Shapps.

Mr Shapps, who was promoted  in last week’s reshuffle, used the fictional alter ego ‘Michael Green’ to write motivational material for the internet marketing company he founded, HowToCorp.

But Mr Green’s 2010 tome How To Bounce Back From Recession is unlikely to be on the bedside table of Chancellor George Osborne, with its baffling gobbledegook, bizarre tips – and advice on borrowing your way out of recession.

Tips: Grant Shapps was promoted to Tory party co-chairman in the cabinet reshuffle last week

For instance, those who find themselves unemployed are advised that it is ‘ree-dic-clu-ous’ to blame themselves for their predicament.

To put themselves in a more positive frame of mind, Mr Green suggests that they take up cycling, fishing, learning to play the guitar or even knitting.

‘Cut out the riotous living,’ he adds. ‘Barter for goods or services... be as good to you as you can. Everyone, even the primary breadwinner, needs some time out from worry and stress. Learn skills or hobbies [eg] playing an instrument, weaving a shawl [or] carpentry.’

Mr Green also offers other suggestions, including taking advantage of low interest rates ‘to buy a house or vehicle, or just borrow money... Prices are low for package vacations and cruises. Many recreational vehicles, cycles, snowmobiles and ATVs [all-terrain vehicles], boats, jet-skis and watercraft, and even airplanes and timeshares are being offered’.

Mr Shapps is at pains to point out 
that he no longer masquerades as Mr Green and had no involvement in the 
recession book. He passed his share of the company behind HowToCorp to 
his wife Belinda in 2008.

But
 Mr Green lives on as a lingering reminder of Mr Shapps’ previous 
career, and continues to generate income for the HowToCorp.

Yesterday,
 The Guardian newspaper claimed that Google had blacklisted a series of 
websites linked to HowToCorp for deploying techniques to raise them 
higher up  search rankings – and therefore boost advertising revenue – 
against the internet giant’s policies. Mr Shapps’ aides disputed the 
claims and said that his lawyers were looking at the allegations carefully.

As recently as 2010, a rival internet business linked Mr Shapps' background to Mr Green.

Alter-ego: A description of 'Michael Green' appears on a blog offering money-saving tips, accompanied by a picture of an unidentified male

Thedailyincome.com, a blog offering money-making tips and links, described Michael Green as  ‘a member of the UK Parliament’ who ‘actually flies his very own  personal plane and lives in a fabulous mansion’. Mr Shapps holds a pilot’s licence.

The account ran next to a picture of an unidentified male, who was wearing a jumper similar to the sort favoured by Mr Shapps.

While Mr Shapps is part of a  Government which is trying to curb the public-sector wage bill, Mr Green advises readers to move into ‘recession-proof’, taxpayer-funded jobs in teaching or healthcare.

Other references are simply baffling, such as the advice: ‘Beware the hungry hippos of the business jungles and swamps!’ The guide concludes: ‘The roller-coaster ride of the recession will eventually  end and you will get off. We want to help ensure you are smiling and refreshed – not blown to bits and dragging.’

Mr Green is also the author of another of the company’s publications, The Meaning Of Your Dreams, in which he promises readers will soon be ‘relieving your repressed emotions’ and ‘indulging in life, freely and unhampered’.

Other ‘toolkits’ produced by the company include How To Find  Happiness, How To Achieve The Swing In Golf and of particular interest to Mr Shapps in his campaigning new job: How To Promote A Product. He set up the web sales business with his wife in 2002, three years before he became the MP for Welwyn Hatfield. After he transferred his share of the company to his wife, she took over the pen name of Michael Green. 

A spokeswoman for Mr Shapps said yesterday that he did not derive any income or dividends from HowToCorp and was not involved with it in any way. She added that the Daily Income blog had nothing to do with Mr Shapps – and said that the MP had no idea where the website had got its information from, or who the man in the photograph was.
