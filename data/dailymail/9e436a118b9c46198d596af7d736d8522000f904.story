James Bond will return - and this time it's to be in a plot which his creator Ian Fleming dreamed up almost 60 years ago.

The world's most famous spy will feature in a new novel by Anthony Horowitz, in which he infiltrates the glamorous world of 1950s motorsport to foil an attack on a grand prix race.

Originally titled Murder on Wheels, the story was created by Fleming before his death in 1964 for a 007 TV series which was never made.

Kept in reserve: A new Bond novel will be based on a plot which Ian Fleming, 007's creator, dreamed up years before Sean Connery introduced the spy to Hollywood in 1962's Dr No (pictured). The plot was never used

Unlike most of the ideas for the series, assembled in the late 1950s, Murder on Wheels was never turned into a short story by Fleming and did not become part of the blockbuster film series.

It has now been handed to the best-selling novelist and screenwriter Anthony Horowitz, who said: 'How could I possibly refuse?'.

The book features original characters such as M and Miss Moneypenny, has the working title Project One and is due for release in September next year.

Mr Horowitz - who recently wrote a new adventure for Sherlock Holmes - said: 'It's no secret that Ian Fleming's extraordinary character has had a profound influence on my life.

'So when the estate approached me to write a new James Bond novel, how could I possibly refuse?

'It's a huge challenge - more difficult even than Sherlock Holmes in some ways - but having original, unpublished material by Fleming has been an inspiration. This is a book I had to write.'

The prolific author's screenwriting credits include Midsomer Murders and Foyle's War, and his Alex Rider series about a teenage spy has sold more than 19 million books.

He follows in the footsteps of authors including Kingsley Amis, William Boyd and Sebastian Faulks who have written new Bond books since Ian Fleming's death.

Mr Boyd's book, Solo, was published last year and featured Bond embroiled in a civil war in 1969 Africa.

The Bond books inspired one of the most successful film franchises in Hollywood history, beginning with Dr No in 1962, and have sold more than 100 million copies.

Kept under wraps: Most of Ian Fleming's ideas were turned into books or films, but a few are kept by his estate

Yet a small number of plots created for 007 by Ian Fleming have still not been used, and they are kept tightly under wraps by his family.

His great-niece Jessie Grimond said: 'There are a few plot outlines which he never used and which, till now, have never been published, or aired.

'Given that Anthony is as brilliant a screenwriter as he is a novelist, we thought it would be exciting to see what he would do with one of them.'
