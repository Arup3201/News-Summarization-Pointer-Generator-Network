A sexy workout class aimed at women over the age of 18 has been revamped and is being marketed at female high school students aged 13 and up.

The female-only Vixen Workout, the brainchild of former Miami Heat cheerleader Janet Jones, has previously only been available to adults because of its overtly sexual content and potty-mouthed playlists.

But due to popular demand, Vixen Workout's trainers have created a special toned-down version of the popular dance class which is suitable for girls aged between 13 and 18. And according to the workout's website, the PG-13 classes will offer the same liberating experience, 'minus the #%$&@'.

Become your inner star: The class encourages girls to embrace their alter-ego and abandon all their responsibilities, even if it's just for an hour

Thus far the classes have proven incredibly popular with young teens eager to get a slice of the Vixen lifestyle, which is aimed at encourage women to let loose, forget their responsibilities and have fun, even if it's just for the hour that they are in the class. 

'The main reason I was excited for this PG-13 Vixen Class was because now my friends are going to feel how I felt when I went to Vixen,' Manolie, a 15-year-old ambassador for the brand, told Racked.com. 'They are going to feel confident and good about themselves. 

'For me it's important that every teen who goes to this class feels this way, because I know what it's like to feel bad about yourself and to feel unconfident. I can't wait for whats in store for PG-13 Vixen!' 

According to Ms Jones, who first started the classes when she was laid off from her corporate job in 2012, the classes provide a haven for women who are in need of an escape - and that same philosophy applies no matter what age the participant. 

'Each Vixen Workout creates a fun club atmosphere where women can let loose, forget responsibilities, and transform into their “alter-ego” or as we say “getting your Beyonce, Ciara, Rihanna on”,' the Vixen website says. 

'[The classes] give women a safe haven to be a little rebellious with no judgments while working out, and having the ultimate ME time.'

'Damn I look good': Participants are told to doll themselves up for the class and feel as positive about themselves as possible by embracing their 'inner Beyonce (L) or Rihanna (R)

Women who take part in the classes are told to wear make-up and dress up for the classes - rather than just wearing a tatty old t-shirt as many people do while working out. 

'Unlike other workouts, we want you to get dolled up to sweat it all off an hour later,' the website adds. 'We want you to look in that mirror and confidently scream out "Damn, I look good!"'

While the classes are currently only being offered at the Vixen Workout studios in Miami, it looks as though the incredible success of the PG-13 program could lead to it being rolled out across their other US bases soon.
