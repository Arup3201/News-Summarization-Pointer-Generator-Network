Mario Balotelli has been charged by the Football Association for posting an allegedly abusive or insulting image on social media.

It is unlikely, though, this incident will result in the end of the striker’s Liverpool career, as the club have no plans to sell him in the January transfer window.

Balotelli’s contract has clauses in it relating to his behaviour but Liverpool are continuing to work with the 24-year-old.

The Liverpool striker insisted that he meant no offence by tweeting that his mother is Jewish

QPR defender Rio Ferdinand was also charged under FA rule E3 back in October.

The former Manchester United man was handed a three-match suspension and fined £25,000 for a tweet which included the word 'sket' - slang for a promiscuous female.

Ferdinand had previously been fined £45,000 in 2012 for referring to then Chelsea defender Ashley Cole as a 'choc ice' on Twitter.

He sparked the latest controversy by posting an image on Instagram that depicted the computer game character Super Mario which read: ‘Don’t be racist — be like Mario. He’s an Italian plumber created by Japanese people who speaks English and looks like a Mexican.’ But below the image, the words continued: ‘jumps like a black man and grabs coin like a Jew.’

Balotelli quickly deleted the picture from his account and responded to criticism, tweeting: ‘My Mom is Jewish so all of you shut up please.’

He subsequently apologised on Twitter on Tuesday, insisting the image was meant to be ‘anti-racist with humour’.

The FA found him in breach of rule E3[1] and the Italian has until 6pm on December 15 to say how he will answer the charge.

Balotelli submitted evidence of how he has been racially abused on social media after he was asked by the FA for his observations about the image he reposted on Instagram on Monday night.

That, however, has not stopped the FA taking action. The FA added in a statement: ‘It is further alleged that this is an ‘Aggravated Breach’ as defined by FA Rule E3[2] as it included a reference to ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race and/or nationality and/or religion or belief.’

After Balotelli submits his decision, his case will be heard by a three-person committee but there is no fixed penalty, unlike if an incident happened during a game.

'Mario Balotelli has been charged by The FA in relation to a recent posting on social media.

'It is alleged the Liverpool player breached FA Rule E3[1] in that his posting was abusive and/or insulting and/or improper.

'It is further alleged that this is an ‘Aggravated Breach’ as defined by FA Rule E3[2] as it included a reference to ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race and/or nationality and/or religion or belief.

'The player has until 6pm on 15 December 2014 to respond to the charge.'

A Liverpool spokesperson said: ‘We acknowledge the FA’s decision and the player will work through the process to answer the charge. While that process is ongoing, the club will not be making any further comment.’

Nicolas Anelka was given the minimum five-match suspension and an £80,000 fine in February for making a quenelle gesture during West Brom’s game with West Ham last December. He was later sacked by the club.

By contrast, Benoit Assou-Ekotto was banned for three matches and fined £50,000 for congratulating Anelka via Twitter on making the gesture, which is viewed as being anti-Semitic.

Since joining Liverpool from AC Milan for £16million, Balotelli has rarely been out of the headlines, thanks to his poor form, swapping shirts with Real Madrid defender Pepe at half-time during a Champions League game and questions about his attitude.

He will miss Saturday's game against Sunderland at Anfield as he recovers from a groin problem that he suffered on international duty.

This is a crucial period for the club and Brendan Rodgers is adamant there will be no distractions.

He said: ‘Sunderland is a big game. Basle, Manchester United away, the League Cup game the week after. It’s a period of big games. I need to choose a team that’s going to be fit and fresh.’
