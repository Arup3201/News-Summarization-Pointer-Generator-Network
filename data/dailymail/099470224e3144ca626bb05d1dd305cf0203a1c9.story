Disgraced: Stuart Hall has been accused of giving his mansion to his wife to protect his fortune

Serial sex offender Stuart Hall has been accused of giving his mansion to his wife to protect his fortune from compensation claims made by his victims.

The former It’s A Knockout presenter is being sued by at least six women in relation to harm and injuries they suffered at his hands.

But the Daily Mail can reveal that in the weeks before he admitted his guilty plea the 83-year-old transferred the ownership of his £2million Cheshire mansion into the name of his wife.

Last night it was claimed the move could be an example of ‘asset stripping’ by the broadcaster to stop his victims from making claims against his fortune.

Alan Collins, a solicitor from Pannone is representing more than 50 victims of Jimmy Savile in their compensation claims against his estate and the BBC.

He is now representing six of Hall’s victims who want to sue him for compensation. Mr Collins is also considering taking action against the BBC on their behalf.

He said: ‘Hall’s admission of guilt means we will be able to pursue these cases expeditiously on behalf of our clients.

‘Victims often live with the memories of the abuse hidden away at the back of their minds for years and it is particularly brave of such victims to come forward and face those memories.’

But he condemned the fact Hall had transferred the ownership of his home before his admission of guilt. Mr Collins said: ‘We see this kind of cynical move all the time, it’s really horrible. It is hugely problematic and it often happens in this sort of case.

‘Victims have enough on their plate already having to deal with such a horrible personal tragedy and a criminal court case.

‘Then when they try to get their little bit of justice in the civil courts they find they are getting a second dose of injustice.’

Hall has been registered as the joint owner of his red brick mansion in Wilmslow with his wife Hazel, 75, since at least 1981.

But his name was removed from the title for the property registered at the Land Registry on February 22, 2013 making Hazel the sole owner. There is no mortgage listed on the property.

Only two weeks earlier Hall had protested his innocence to the allegations of sexual assault on the steps of Preston Crown Court.

Then, just weeks after safely moving his property into the name of his wife, Hall changed his plea and said he was guilty of indecently assaulting 13 girls.

Mr Collins warned the change in ownership will make it difficult for his victims to make a financial claim against Hall because there is no guarantee he will be able to pay any compensation awarded.

He said: ‘Very often we find houses being transferred, moneys being sent overseas, you name it and it’s done. It’s then very difficult to unravel because quite often we have to go to the High Court to get a freezing order to stop it.

'The victims will have to convince a judge the money has been transferred simply to defeat a civil claim.’

He also warned there was very little victims could do to stop their abuser from securing their financial position until they have been found guilty in a criminal court.

He said: ‘Victims are prevented from taking any action to protect their own positions because it might compromise any prosecution.

'A common defence practice in criminal trials is of the defence to accuse the victim of making up allegations to try to get “at my client’s money”.

‘Mr Abuser can often be given advice telling him that if he goes down he is probably going to get sued by the victims therefore it might be a good idea to “arrange your affairs”.

‘In this case the victims have a cast iron case to bring against Stuart Hall but if he has transferred all his assets he will turn around and say “sorry, but I can’t pay you”.’

Liz Dux of Slater & Gordon is representing another 50 victims of Savile in their claims for compensation against his estate and the BBC.

She said moving the ownership of a property into the name of a spouse makes it less attractive for solicitors to want to take up a civil claim.

She added: ‘If someone is suing a litigant in person it is normal that you would look into their means before you would make a decision whether or not to prosecute.

‘You have to make a very practical decision because whilst you might win you might never be able to enforce the judgement.’

According to friends, Hall’s wife of 55 years, Hazel, is standing ‘rock solid’ behind him. They say she is determined to protect her two children Francesca, 52, and Danny, 50, and their four grandchildren.

A source said: ‘It’s been tough on everyone but the family are being very supportive of him.’

In his biography Hall claims it was Hazel who ‘fell for’ their home in Wilmslow and he ‘arranged a purchase on the spot’.

Hall’s lawyers last night failed to respond to inquiries from the Mail about the home ownership transfer.
