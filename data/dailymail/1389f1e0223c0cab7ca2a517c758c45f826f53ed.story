One of the young men who made sexual assault allegations against former Commons Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans is the son of a gangster, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.

The accuser's father was sentenced to more than ten years in prison after a fellow gang member gave evidence against him.

The ‘supergrass’ is in a witness protection scheme in case his former associates try to take revenge on him.

Neither the identity of the gangster, nor the extraordinary details of the case, can be revealed because it could lead to the breach of the anonymity granted to the accuser when he made his claims against the MP.

The accuser remains close to his father – who has now been released from prison – and recently posted a picture on a social networking site showing the pair embracing.

Mr Evans, 56, was charged with one count of rape, five of sexual assault, one attempted sexual assault and two indecent assaults, but was unanimously cleared of all charges by a  jury at Preston Crown Court earlier this month.

In last week’s Mail on Sunday, Mr Evans called for a review of the anonymity rules that allowed his seven male accusers to keep their identities secret while he has been reduced to personal and financial ruin.
