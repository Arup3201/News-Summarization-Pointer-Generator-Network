A swinging couple sprayed a can of bear repellent into the face of a man after a weekend sex session arranged on the internet went wrong.

Stephen Barclay, 36, and his lover Leanne Reid, 31, had spent a drug-fuelled weekend with total stranger Owen Greenan at their home.

The couple had arranged for him to stay at their isolated property for the orgy after they contacted each other online.

The pair, of Glespin, Lanarkshire, had picked Mr Greenan up and taken him back to their secluded cottage on the Friday evening and he was supposed to spend the weekend with the couple.  

However in the early hours of Sunday morning the romp turned ugly when Mr Greenan refused to let Barclay take a picture of him on his mobile phone.

Reid handed her partner a can of Sabre Wild Max Bear Attack deterrent spray and he released the chemical into Mr Greenan's face.

He fled the house in agony and was found running down a road by a lorry driver and the police were called.

Officers later arrested Reid and Barclay and charged them with a string of offences.  

A hearing at Lanark Sheriff Court heard Barclay and Reid both admit assaulting Mr Greenan on March 27 last year.

Prosecutor Gary Dow told the court that the weekend 'had gone well' before matters escalated.

He said Mr Greenan had been woken up on the couch at 4am by Reid who invited him into the couple's bedroom for a smoke.

But on arriving there he found Barclay sitting in a hot tub drinking a can of beer.

Bear repellant is similar to the pepper spray sold as 'mace' in the United States, used for fending off attackers.

Sabre Wild Max – one of the most popular Canadian brands – uses hot pepper plants as an ingredient and is extremely powerful.

The manufacturers warn that it is not for use on humans, as it can cause intense pain if sprayed into the eyes.

A normal canister is designed to spray a heavy fog up to 40 yards away – so if it is fired too close  to a human eyeball, the force of the  discharge can cause pressure injuries.

The spray itself also works by irritating the mucous membranes of the eyes, causing pain and the production of tears.

It also causes coughing and sneezing. The only treatment is to  seek fresh air immediately and blink repeatedly to cleanse the eye.

Mr Dow said: 'The complainer sat on the toilet seat and Mr Barclay held a phone out to take a photo.

'He told the complainer, "smile for the camera."

'He went to get up and Leanne Reid said "f****** smile". She also had said that she was going to get a knife to stab him.

'Mr Barclay then said to the complainer, "Do you think you can come here all weekend, **** my wife and nothing will happen?".'

Barclay then instructed Reid to give him the repellent, which he told police he had bought in Canada, before he sprayed it on his victim.

Mr Dow added: 'The complainer then ran out of the house leaving his belongings.'

Mr Greenan was later taken to Wishaw General Hospital where he was treated for his injuries and held in a contamination room before being released.

Representing Barclay, defence agent Neil McShane told the court that drugs had played a part in the weekend's events.

He said: 'This occurred at a time when parties had been taking ketamine.

'Mr Barclay had been up with very little sleep from Friday to Sunday.'

Archie Hill, who represented Reid, described the attack as 'an unfortunate turn of events'.  

Sheriff Nikola Stewart deferred sentence on the pair until next month for a full range of reports.  

She said: 'I'm intrigued to what's going on.

'It's a concern that I see people taking advantage of someone that was a guest in their remote home.'

Barclay and Reid admitted assaulting Mr Greenan by ordering him to sit on a toilet seat, threatening to stab him, ordering him to remove his hands from his face and discharging the bear repellent in his face.  

Barclay also pleaded guilty to unlawful possession of cannabis worth up to £7,650 and the canister of the Sabre Wild Max Bear Attack deterrent.  

Reid's not guilty plea to a charge that she had wasted police time by alleging that Mr Greenan had raped her was accepted by prosecutors and the charge was dropped.

Charges that Barclay and Reid had possessed and supplied amphetamine and ketamine on the same date were also dropped.  

Both refused to comment as they left court.
