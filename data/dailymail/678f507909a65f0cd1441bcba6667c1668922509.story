Since its release last year, the movie 'Frozen' has captured the hearts of children everywhere, with little girls begging for Princess Anna or Queen Elsa dolls.

But, when one little girl made her request for a 'Frozen' doll, her father found the perfect opportunity to make the most 'daddest' dad joke ever.

Instead of giving her a 'Frozen' doll, he froze a doll in a block of ice to deliver to her a literally frozen doll.

The video appears to be filmed in the United States.

Dad Joke: When one little girl asked her father for a 'Frozen' doll for Christmas, he found the perfect opportunity to make the most 'daddest' dad joke ever

Literally: Instead of granting his daughter's request and giving her a 'Frozen' doll, he freezes a doll in a block of ice to deliver to her a literally frozen

Proud: Proud of himself, the father holds the block of his ice and says 'You told me you wanted a frozen doll for Christmas, isn't that what you wanted?'

In a YouTube video, a young girl is seen in a purple princess costume, ready to open what she thinks is a 'Frozen' doll.

The girl rips through the wrapping paper and sees a block of ice. 

With a confused expression, she says 'What the?'

In the background, her father, proud of himself, says 'You told me you wanted a frozen doll for Christmas, isn't that what you wanted?'

The girl, completely unamused, walks over to her father sporting a solemn expression and when her father repeats his question she yells 'Daddy, No! The princess.'

The father takes the block of ice from the wrapping paper and, flaunting his pun, says 'It's a frozen doll. See? it's frozen.'

The video ends before we see the little girl unleash her fury.

Hopefully, when the girl is older, she'll look back on that Christmas morning, finally able to appreciate the flawlessly executed dad joke. 

Maybe one day she'll 'Let it Go.'
