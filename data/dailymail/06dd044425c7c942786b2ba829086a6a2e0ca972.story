Shoppers could be told how their meat has been killed, with labels on the packaging informing them over whether the animal was 'stunned' or 'unstunned', a government minister has suggested.

George Eustice, the Parliamentary under-secretary of state for farming, food and the marine environment, suggested labels such as 'stunned' on the packaging would give a 'clear definition' to consumers.

It comes amid an ongoing row about halal meat and the way it is packaged and presented to customers.

In May, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg demanded better labelling of meat and suggested suppliers used a designated 'halal' logo.

It also emerged that major supermarkets such as Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons, Waitrose and Marks and Spencer were selling the imported meat, while popular restaurant chains such as Pizza Express had been serving halal chicken without making it clear on the menu.

Halal meat comes from the traditional Muslim method of slaughtering but is controversial because animals are killed by having their throats cut and then having their blood drained.

The European Commission is set to report early next year on whether meat sold in the European Union should be labelled.

But Mr Eustice suggested this week that meat products could be labelled 'stunned' or 'unstunned, which would effectively alert shoppers as to whether their meat was killed according to religious guidelines.

According to The Telegraph, Mr Eustice told MPs: '[Backbenchers have] made the point that it would be wrong just to label meat as 'stunned' or 'unstunned', and that a fairer way would be to list all the different methods of slaughter.

'The only thing I would say in response is that, from the EU perspective, 'stunned' has a clear legal definition in the legislation, and it is simply that an animal is rendered insensible to pain almost immediately.'

Mr Eustice has suggested labels such as 'stunned' or 'unstunned' for meat packaging, to give customers clear information over whether the meat is halal (pictured) or non-halal and suitable under religious guidelines

He also said it would be 'difficult' to brand meat products either kosher or halal because 'there is no single definition of halal' and that a 'further complication is that not all meat slaughtered by kosher methods is deemed kosher'.

And he added that it would be complicated to list all of the different methods of slaughter, and said there may not be a 'huge consumer appetite' to do so.

HALAL 

Halal slaughtering involves cutting through the large arteries in the neck with one swipe of a blade, while a Muslim butcher recites a religious verse.

All blood is then drained away since the consumption of blood is forbidden under Islamic law.

Under Islamic law, an animal must be slaughtered by having its throat cut while it is conscious.

NON-HALAL 

In comparison, the non-halal method involves taking animals to an abattoir where they are stunned before being killed.

It means the animal is unconscious when it is killed and has an instantaneous death, as opposed to enduring what animal rights activists claim is drawn-out pain and suffering.

Once the animal has been killed at the abattoir, it is removed and taken to be hung and butchered.

KOSHER

According to the laws, in order for a meat to be kosher it must come from an animal that is ruminant and have split hooves. 

Ruminant animals chew food once and swallow, before regurgitating it and chewing again. 

Before slaughtering, the animal must be healthy and uninjured and a sharp knife is used to slice through the main arteries and windpipe, causing a drop in blood pressure that causes the animal to lose consciousness. 

Huw Irranca-Davies, the shadow environment minister, said the labelling of meat had been 'roundly and rightly rejected' by MPs last year.

However, he said that if all different types of slaughter should be labelled then 'make room on the label for slaughter by electrical current, or by carbon dioxide, inert gas, captive bolt pistol, gunshot or free bullet and so on.'

'Some advocate doing so, and it would certainly satisfy the need for transparency,' he added.

The row over the labelling of halal meat was sparked in May when it emerged millions of people were being sold halal and kosher meat without being told.

Several restaurants such as Pizza Express, KFC and Subway were found to be selling halal meat – mainly chicken – without printing the information on menus.

Chains including Domino's, GBK, Nando's, KFC, Ask and Slug & Lettuce also admitted to using halal meat in some dishes, mainly chicken, and locations.

At least ten top higher education establishments - including Oxford University and the University of Manchester – were also found to be secretly serving up meat from potentially unstunned animals.

In Manchester, 85 per cent of all meat served was found to unlabelled halal meal, while all the chicken served at universities in Sheffield and Exeter - which is halal - was not marked as so.

Cardiff and Lincoln were also found to be among the universities serving significant quantities of the meat, without telling consumers.

It also emerged that most of the major supermarkets were selling New Zealand lamb killed according to halal ritual without providing labels.

The switch to slaughtering animals in line with Islamic ritual helps supermarket chains save money because the end product can be eaten by Muslims and non-Muslims alike.

Both halal and kosher slaughter involve a religious ritual in which the throat is cut. But some animals are not stunned beforehand, which is said to leave them in pain.

In conventional slaughterhouses, cows, sheep and chicken are stunned, usually with an electric shock, to ensure they are unconscious before their throats are cut. This is said to minimise their suffering.

After it emerged that halal was widely sold unknowingly to consumers, Mr Clegg demanded better labelling of meat.

He said that while he personally had 'no problem' eating halal meat, produce should be clearly labelled because 'consumers want to know more about how the food arrived on their plate.'

Religious groups from all faiths, vets and animal welfare groups have also previously joined calls for new labels to identify halal or kosher meat.
