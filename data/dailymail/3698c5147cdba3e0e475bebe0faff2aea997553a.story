A father-of-two left with horrific face and body injuries in a random acid attack has told how his life has been devastated.

Darren Pidgeon, 27, was seriously injured in what police believe was a completely unprovoked assault as he drove through a town centre late at night.

A stranger approached his car in Rayleigh, Essex in June and sprayed acid through his window.

The attacker then repeatedly punched  Mr Pidgeon, who fell out of his car screaming after managing to fight off his assailant.

Darren Pidgeon was the victim of a completely unprovoked late-night acid attack in Essex earlier this summer

He says the random attack, which hospitalised him for a month and almost left him blind, has ruined his life (pictured left just after the attack, and as he appears now right)

Doctors expect the healing process to take two years, but Mr Pidgeon says the scarring he has been left with from the attack has ruined his life

The ordeal left him with scarring down his entire right side and injuries that will affect him for the rest of his life.

He feared he may never see his children's faces again but, luckily, he was not blinded by the corrosive liquid.

Police said they can find no motive for the attack  and are appealing for more witnesses.

Mr Pidgeon, a carer from Rayleigh, said: 'It was just an unprovoked attack and it has really ruined my life.

'It has put me out of work and now I have to wear make-up to cover the scars. It's embarrassing. When I was attacked I had no idea what was happening and I was confused more than anything.

Mr Pidgeon was hospitalised  for a month. Skin had to be taken from his leg to repair his face, and he was left with scars covering the rest of his body 

He has now told how he feared he would never see his children's faces again following the horrific attack (pictured just after the attack, during his recovery, and as he appears today)

'I didn't know why this guy was doing it. I was just screaming "my eyes, my eyes" and I was in excruciating pain.'

He added: 'At first I thought it might have been pepper spray but it was much worse than that.

'It was just a burning feeling. I felt like my face was just melting off. I can't understand why someone would want to do that to another human being.'

The attack left Mr Pidgeon hospitalised for a month and he had multiple skin grafts with tissue from his leg used to rebuild his damaged face.

He is currently undergoing physiotherapy to heal his arm and must exercise his face to prevent him losing his facial expressions.

Doctors expect the healing to take two years but Mr Pidgeon, who has now moved to London due to the attack, said the effects will last a lifetime.

He added: 'Part of me feels like there's no reason to go on anymore. I've got permanent scars and it is all down my face, my arm, my shoulder, my back.

Medical experts fear the scars to Mr Pidgeon's face and side will take at least two years to heal

Police initially believed the attack was related to a road rage incident, but have since ruled that out

'My skin feels like rubber now. I touch it and I think I have a mask on or something.

'I have lost my job, I have had to move out because my mum gets upset and we argue. Everything has been destroyed.

'I've got no money so I can't afford any plastic surgery but the thing I want most is just for this guy to be caught. If you are going to let this happen to somebody you have got to suffer too.'

Police initially thought the incident was a road rage attack after an altercation at a roundabout but they have since ruled out that theory.

They are now appealing for information about a suspect who is 5ft 8ins to 5ft 10ins tall, slim with short, light coloured hair.

He was wearing a light grey polo shirt, blue denim jeans and a black hoodie.

Det Sgt Mike Calvert said: 'This was an unprovoked attack, which has caused appalling injuries to the victim.'
