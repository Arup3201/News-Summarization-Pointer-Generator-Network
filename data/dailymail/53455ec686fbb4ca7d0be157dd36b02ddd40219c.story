A 42-year-old man who sued Metro for 'slipping on a banana peel' in a Washington station elevator has been charged with fraud after a video shows him planting the slippery skin and purposely tripping himself over.

Maurice Owens, from District Heights, tripped over one night at about 9pm on August 8 as he walked out of an elevator at the busy Potomac Avenue station, saying he fell from a banana peel left on the floor and injured his hip and leg, according to The Washington Post.

He sued the transit agency for $15,000, part of which was for a $4,500 chiropractor bill.

However a recently-found surveillance tape has showed Owens was a victim of his own making.

The footage clearly shows that the elevator was empty when Owens walked in.

While it does not clearly show him placing the peel on the ground, you can see movements with his hands and pockets.

When he steps away from the door while still traveling in the elevator the banana skin can be seen.

But perhaps the most incriminating piece of footage is a part where Owens starts to search for a security camera - and then looks worryingly straight at it.

As the doors open, Owens is sure to step exactly on the skin and then falls forward, before quickly getting up.

Thanks to the video, the Metro claim has now been thrown out and Owens has subsequently been charged with second-degree fraud.

'Through our investment in digital camera systems across the system, we are demonstrating our commitment to protecting fare-paying riders and the region’s taxpayers from fraudulent claims,' Metro spokesman Dan Stessel said.

Owens reported his injuries to the station manager straight away, with Metro Transit Police called.

Owens was then taken to Howard University Hospital for treatment.

Two weeks later he filed a lawsuit.

In an interview with Metro officials, Owens had reportedly asked why a custodian for the station had 'not cleaned up the banana peel prior to his entering the elevator', according to the police report.

'What you will see in the camera footage is that the elevator, just prior to Mr. Owens boarding, shows there’s nothing on the floor,' Stessel said. 

The elevator incident occurred here, at the busy Potomac Avenue Metro station in central Washington

'He is then seen with what appears to be a banana peel in his hand, looking in the direction of the camera,' Stessel said.

'An object can be seen on the ground, and then when the elevator doors open, he steps on the object, thrusts himself forward and falls out of the elevator.'

Metro presented its case to the U.S. attorney’s office.

A warrant was issued accusing Owens of fraud and he was arrested.

At a hearing this month, a D.C. Superior Court judge ordered Owens to have a mental-health screening and evaluation.

He is scheduled to appear in court on Monday.

The case is one of the roughly 225 claims Metro’s Third Party Claims office receives each month.

Most seek compensation for slips and falls on station platforms, stairs, escalators, elevators and buses, or while getting on and off trains.

Oldest trick in the book: Banana peels are notoriously slippery

Fewer than half of those claims result in a settlement from Metro, and the average payout is less than $2,500, Stessel said.

Over the past few years the agency paid $50 to a Metro rider who said oil dripped from a rail car’s air conditioner onto his shirt; $45 to a rider who claimed to have gotten his sandal stuck in an escalator at West Falls Church; $104.37 to a driver who said the gate at the West Falls Church parking garage came down on his vehicle; and $100 to a person who said he lost his footing while walking down steps at the Branch Avenue Metro station.

Stessel noted that Metro sometimes opens its own claims.

'For example, if a person gets transported to the hospital, we will automatically open a claim,' he said.

'If the person never gets in touch with us, it is classified as ''abandoned''.'
