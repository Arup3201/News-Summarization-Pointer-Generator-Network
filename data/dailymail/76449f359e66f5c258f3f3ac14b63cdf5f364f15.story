Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today called on Scotland Yard to investigate ‘grotesque’ claims police helped to ‘cover up’ the death of an eight-year-old boy at the hands of a Westminster paedophile ring.

Vishambar Mehrotra claims his son Vishal was murdered by a Westminster-based abusers after disappearing on the day of the Royal wedding in 1981.

He said a male prostitute told him he was taken to the Elm Guest House where high-profile abusers attacked children.

Mystery: Vishal Mehrotra's father Vishambar (right) claimed today that his son (left) was abducted, abused and murdered by the Westminster VIP paedophile ring after disappearing on the day of the Royal wedding in 1981

Referring to claims on his weekly phone-in show on radio station LBC, Mr Clegg said: ‘You can’t think of a more serious and grotesque allegation than that, and it clearly needs to be looked into.

‘I think it is right for instance in other parts of the country that police officers have been, are now under scrutiny under the magnifying glass, for not having acted in Rotherham for instance.’

He added: ‘We are in the early stages of really a reckoning with our past, of things happening on a scale and of a gravity which just a few months ago would have seemed unimaginable and almost too horrific to contemplate.’ 

Mr Mehota recorded the conversation but when he presented police with the evidence, Scotland Yard ‘pooh poohed’ it and failed to investigate, he alleged.

He claims that what happened to his son was part of a 'huge cover-up' while an MP has called for a full police inquiry. 

Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, he said: ‘I was contacted by a young man. He told me he believed Vishal may have been taken by paedophiles in the Elm Guest House.

‘He said there were very highly placed people there. He talked about judges and politicians who were abusing little boys.

‘I recorded the whole 15-minute conversation and took it to police. But instead of investigating it, they just pooh-poohed it and I never heard anything about the tape again. The whole thing went cold.

‘At that time I trusted the police. But when nothing happened, I became confused and concerned. Now it is clear to me that there has been a huge cover up. There is no doubt in my mind.’

Tip-off: Vishambar Mehrotra said soon after his son vanished a male prostitute told him he was taken to the Elm Guest House, pictured, where a VIP paedophile ring abused children

Vishal disappeared while walking back to his home in Putney after a family day trip to watch the celebrations for Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer’s wedding on July 29, 1981.

He had been walking a few hundred yards ahead of his family members and vanished less than a mile from his home.

It was almost a year before his remains were found in isolated woodland in West Sussex in February 1982.

He was missing his legs, pelvis and lower spine - and much of his clothing, including his Superman underpants were also gone.

Four months after Vishal’s body was found, police raided Elm Guest House in Barnes, south-west London, and questioned dozens of men including a number of high profile individuals.

Last week, another victim came forward alleging to have witnessed the murder of three boys including one who was strangled by a Conservative MP during a sex game.

The Metropolitan Police announced last week that it is investigating the possibility of murders linked to the Elm Guest House.

Mr Mehrotra, 69, said that now after all these years the truth about what happened to Vishal would finally be investigated properly.

In May 1983, as police wound up the inquiry into Vishal Mehrotra’s death. West Sussex coroner Mark Calvert Lee recorded an open verdict at an inquest but said he believed ‘foul play’ was likely.

It has been alleged several high-profile individuals abused also boys at the prestigious Dolphin Square (pictured) development in Pimlico

The owners of the Elm Guest House, Carole and Harry Kasir, were fined £1,000 each and given suspended nine-month sentences at the Old Bailey but were found not guilty of running a brothel.

Mrs Kasir - who committed suicide in 1990 - later admitted to child protection officers that children from the council-run Grafton Close Children’s Home had been taken to the brothel and gave them names of people who had visited the guesthouse.

The late Liberal MP Cyril Smith is one public figure widely alleged to have abused children from Grafton Close at the Elm Guest House.

Last night Labour MP John Mann said: ‘It is another extraordinary development and it tallies with other allegations.

‘This young boy died in terrible circumstances and his family deserve a full police inquiry.’

AMetropolitan Police spokesman said the force was ‘not in a position to comment’ about Mr Mehota’s claims.

Allegations of a VIP paedophile ring 30 years ago are being investigated by Scotland Yard through Operation Fairbank, launched two years.

As well as Elm Guest House, some of the abuse allegedly took place at flats in Dolphin Square, Pimlico, where some politicians had London homes.
