Convicted: Jordan Swales, 21, raped and beat an 18-year old woman as he walked her home from a party. The attack was only stopped when three members of the public responded to the victims cries for help

A rapist was arrested by a group of courageous members of the public after they heard his victim's desperate cries for help.

Jordan Swales, 21, raped and beat the 18-year-old woman as he accompanied her home from a house party.

But in the midst of the violent attack, a couple were joined by another man as they made a citizen's arrest on the rapist while he hid in a bush.

At the trial in Manchester Crown Court, Kirsty Normanton, her boyfriend Dean King and a third man Alex Ashworth were commended for their bravery.

Swales had attended the same party as his victim on August 16 last year at a flat in Eccles, Salford.

He left the party with the young woman, who was a student, and both boarded a tram.

After little interaction between the pair on the journey home, Swales offered to walk the woman home.

Walking across a grassy area, his behaviour suddenly changed, and he began to rape and strangle the woman.

The court heard how the victim 'thought she was going to die' due to the 'significant violence' that Swales was using.

Miss Normanton and Mr King were 
walking nearby when they heard the girl's cries for help, so Miss Normanton
rang police whilst her boyfriend ran to a nearby house for help.

The victim was able to escape when Miss Normanton approached Swales.

The attacker ran away and hid in a bush, pretending to be unconscious and saying that he was the victim of an assault and his girlfriend had been raped.

When Mr King returned with Mr Ashworth, they grabbed the rapist, detaining him before police arrived.

Swales, from Manchester, denied rape but was jailed for eight years. The court heard how the victim, who suffered neck and 
facial injuries during the attack, has been 'profoundly affected'.

The student now suffers from paranoia, anxiety and has flashbacks of the incident. Her studies have also been affected by the violent attack and the court was told how she is now too afraid to go out at night.

Defence counsel Mr Richard Littler said
his client had endured a 'difficult childhood' and was placed in care at the age of eight
after his parents split up.

He added: 'He has been passed from pillar to 
post through various foster carers.

'He has had little assistance in his 
life particularly in childhood, he has had a lack of positive role 
models and a lack of supported family environment. There is reference to him using drugs and alcohol in his early years.'

But passing sentence Judge Michael 
Henshell told Swales: 'You carried out a sustained attack, it was 
sudden, impulsive and violent case of rape.

'You told her you were going to kill 
her, she said that she couldn't breathe and she struggled even though 
that made the attack of rape more violent.

'The attack you were carrying out was 
interrupted by members of the public who were nearby and who heard the 
victim screaming for help. Kirsty heard screaming and approached the 
area where the attack was taking place.

'She was later approached by the 
defendant and was made to feel as if she was about to be attacked 
herself.'

Reserving praise for the members of the public who intervened, the judge added: 'Their actions could have caused them 
to be subjected to violence themselves but they persisted in their 
actions.

'They all probably saved the victim from further harm and their 
actions were highly commendable and they will be commended by the 
court.'

Swales will be on licence for six 
years after he is released from jail and he was ordered to sign the 
Sex Offender Register.

After the case Detective Constable Jon Weir, of 
Greater Manchester Police said: 'I must reserve special praise for all 
those members of the public that got involved and who did not ignore the
victim's pleas for help.

'They acted bravely and calmly, met 
this dangerous situation head-on and between them detained a rapist and 
comforted the victim. Had it not been for their actions the
attack could have been prolonged and the offender may have possibly 
even got away with this heinous offence.'
