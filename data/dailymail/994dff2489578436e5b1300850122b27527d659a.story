In a game that attracted a worldwide audience of around 400 million people, Real Madrid claimed El Clasico bragging rights with a 3-1 destruction of Barcelona.

Luis Suarez impressed on his long-awaited debut but it was Neymar who silenced the Bernabeu by opening the scoring after only four minutes before Cristiano Ronaldo sent the teams in level with a penalty for his 16th league goal of the season.

The second half belonged to the hosts who doubled their lead through a header from defender Pepe before Karim Benzema completed a beautiful passing move to slot home their third and final goal.

Here, Sportsmail's Pete Jenson gives  his verdict on how the players performed.

Real Madrid:

Iker Casillas - 7

His first half save from Lionel Messi changed the game. Had it been 2-0 so early Barcelona would have controlled the game and passed Real into submission. Still the man for the big occasion. 

Dani Carvajal - 7

Steady defensively and got forward well to support the attacks. Came back into the side for Alvaro Arbeloa and justified the recall.

Sergio Ramos - 6

Had to work overtime in the first half as Luis Suarez tormented Marcelo and found space in behind the often absent Brazilian full-back. The two continued their duel in the second half and he was as relieved as anyone when the Uruguyan departed on 70 minutes.

Pepe - 7

All over the place in the opening stages of the game but recovered his composure and his towering header was the most important goal of the game. Impressive display that shows why he still keeps Raphael Varane out of the side … just.

Marcelo - 6

Struggled defensively in the first half especially but always has that burst of energy to turn defence into attack and as Barça struggled with Real's counter-attacks in the second half really began to come into his own. 

Isco (R) was one of Real Madrid's star performers as he seized his chance in the absence of Gareth Bale

Toni Kroos - 7

Still keeping his head above water in Real Madrid's Xabi-less midfield. Alonso's shoes are tough to fill but the German did well in his first real test this season. Set up Pepe's goal with a perfect corner. 

Luka Modric - 7

Roared off in the second half as Carlo Ancelotti replaced him. The former Tottenham man is idolized by the Bernabeu and once again in the most difficult of games he stood up to be counted. 

Isco - 8

Ancelotti said in midweek: 'Isco knows that if Bale is fit then Bale always plays' but how can the Italian coach leave Isco out on this form? Come to think of it how can Vicente Del Bosque leave Isco out on this form. Outstanding.

James Rodriguez -7

Madrid's fourth midfield musketeer was involved in that lightning break for the third goal. He will never have Angel Di Maria's energy but he is starting to show that in terms of assists and goals he can match the Argentine. 

Cristiano Ronaldo - 7

Not his greatest Clasico by any stretch but he still got his goal from the penalty spot and won the personal duel with Messi hands down. Was unhappy with various refereeing decisions but will be delighted with the way the game turned out. Madrid showed they can win without him putting in an extra-terrestrial performance. 

Karim Benzema - 8

Another who was cheered off when substituted. And he deserved it. So often the most criticized of Madrid's BBC forward line, Karim Benzema stepped up in the absence of Gareth Bale to lead the line and get the goal that sealed the win.

Barcelona

Claudio Bravo - 7

His handling was good and he did not deserve to be on the losing side. Finally conceded his first goals of the season but then none of them could be blamed on him. A decent showing. 

Dani Alves - 7

Solid from a veteran of six years of Clasicos. Got forward and covered plenty of ground but his finally delivery often let him down when he got around the back of Real Madrid’s defence.

Gerard Piqué - 7

Started well holding Barcelona together when Real reacted to conceding the early goal. But then slipped for the penalty that gave them a way back into the game. Barça need to build a defence around him and there are still question marks over whether they have done that with last summer’s signings – Vermaelen still out, and Mathieu shifted to full-back for this one. 

Javier Mascherano - 6

The world’s best holding midfielder was back in the centre of defence and struggled against the charge of the white brigade in the second half. Was exposed by the open way that Barcelona played but should be used to that by now. 

Jeremy Mathieu - 6

Far stronger defensively than the out of form Jordi Alba who was left on the bench but the Spain international has more in his locker going forward and at times the Frenchman could not make the most of the possession that he had. 

Barcelona coach Luis Enrique (R) lost his first Clasico as his side fell to their first league defeat

Xavi - 6

Was the surprise selection in midfield ahead of Ivan Rakitic and for 45 minutes he justified that selection but tired badly in the second half. Still has the ability to keep the ball but people forget how much ground he covered in his pomp - was ultimately over-run and outnumbered by the home side.

Sergio Busquets- 7

Will be under pressure this season as Luis Enrique considers playing Mascherano in front of his defence. Busquets came back into midfield for the Argentine but Barcelona lost the midfield battle. 

Andres Iniesta - 6

Disappointing. Was over-powered for the Benzema goal and unable to stop Isco spinning away into space. Barça's midfield trio looked lightweight against Madrid's four, especially when Xavi slowed in the second half. 

Lionel Messi celebrates with Neymar after the Brazilian opened the scoring after only four minutes

Lionel Messi - 6

Missed the kind of chance he has spent the last five years scoring with his eyes closed and it was down hill from there. Picked up a first half booking and that seemed to sum up what was an uncharacteristic display.

Luis Suarez - 8

Short of scoring he did everything possible in the first half to put the game beyond Real Madrid. He set up Neymar for the first goal and Messi for what should have been the second. Luis Enrique was asked after the game if he felt he had made a mistake by playing Suarez from the start and he said: 'No, definitely not.' 

Neymar - 8

Took his goal brilliantly but failed to last the 90 minutes. Has been around the world on international duty recently and perhaps that showed. Barça needed him to keep carrying the game to Real in the second half but the threat he offered lifted and Carvajal was gradually allowed greater licence to get forward himself.
