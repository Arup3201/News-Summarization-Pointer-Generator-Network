A female Mayor who dressed up as a sausage to welcome the Olympic torch into her town has been mocked by its residents for her unsavoury 8ft costume which resembled 'something from a stag-do'.

Louth Mayoress Jill Makinson-Sanders donned the giant pink novelty outfit in an effort to promote Lincolnshire's famous sausages, but ended up being ridiculed for its distinctly suggestive appearance.

Residents in the Lincolnshire town branded the costume 'obscene' after the 8ft pink outfit was spotted bobbing along Louth's High Street to greet the torch.

Obscene: The costume worn by Louth's female town Mayor, Jill Makinson-Sanders raised more than a few chuckles when she wore it to greet the Olympic torch recently

Cllr Makinson-Sanders chose her unique sausage role to promote Louth's finest and most popular export.

The Lincolnshire market town and its residents are proud of their produce, with Lincolnshire sausages often winning national awards.

Earlier this month Louth had campaigned for Lincolnshire sausages to be given designated protective status, so that only sausages produced in Lincolnshire could bear the county's name.

However, when government officials turned down the request, Cllr Makinson-Sanders took drastic action to promote the town's image - a stunt which appears to have backfired.

Mother-of-two Sandra Ellington, 38, said: 'She probably thought she was being quite fun and quirky.

'People couldn’t take their eyes off her because it looks so rude - her outfit certainly gained a few titters among the crowd.

'It’s something you’d expect to see on a stag-do - not being worn by a respectable mayor. 

'She didn’t carry the torch but when you saw her running down the street by the torch relay team nearby it really looked like she was wearing something obscene.'

Another Louth resident added: 'I can't believe she could have been so stupid - she's made the town a laughing stock.'

Resident Bill Nicholson added: 'The council chamber must put a stop to this embarrassment, and restore some dignity to the people of Louth who do not want the local Olympic event high-jacked for commercial reasons.

'To insult the whole spirit of the Olympic movement and the modest people who have carried the torch is not in Louth’s interest.'

Describing her choice of costume before the torch appeared in Louth, Cllr Makinson-Sanders said: 'It took me quite a long time to track down a costume but happily managed it eventually. I just hope it won’t be too hot that morning!

'We have the opportunity to tell the world that we have brilliant multi-award winning independent butchers in our ancient market town and that Lincolnshire sausages are very, very special.'

Cllr Makinson-Sanders yesterday defended her choice of costume.

She said: 'Louth Town Council has not been officially invited to have anything to do with the Olympic torch or to meet the torch and welcome it in to the town.

'I was not attending therefore in my capacity as mayor.

'I serve the town as mayor but only when invited to do so. I was not wearing a chain at this event.'

Patrick Neville, chairman of Louth Food and Drink group on Louth Town Partnership, congratulated the Mayor for her costume, claiming it helped promote the town's food history.

He said: 'She is doing what Louth richly deserves – getting us recognised as a food town of excellence.'
