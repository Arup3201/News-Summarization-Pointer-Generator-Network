'Untenable position': Former Navy officer David Axon, above,  was relieved of his command of the HMS Somerset after junior officers complained of bullying 

A disgraced Royal Navy captain is suing the Ministry of Defence for more than £300,000 damages after a civil servant exposed his bullying in a newspaper.

Former commander David Axon says his human rights were breached when a military press officer leaked the story of how his verbal abuse of junior officers led him to be relieved of the command of the warship HMS Somerset.

He is seeking the damages on the grounds that the MoD employed Bettina Jordan-Barber – who was later charged with misconduct in public office for selling stories to the press – and that she obtained the details of his punishment from colleagues or office computers.

Last night, one leading media lawyer warned that the case could trigger a flood of copycat claims.

Mr Axon’s legal team say the disciplinary action, which was taken after two junior naval officers accused him of intimidating them, should have remained secret, and that its exposure caused him ‘loss, distress, anxiety, humiliation and damage to his reputation’.

‘The claimant suffered the humiliation of having his reputation sullied in the national press. The articles were read by family and friends as well as potential employers,’ they say in a High Court writ, which has been seen by The Mail on Sunday.

They also highlight the ‘failure’ of the MoD to ‘acknowledge its wrongdoing or to apologise’.

The writ was drawn up by Hugh Tomlinson QC, a human rights barrister who sits on the board of media regulation pressure group Hacked Off. He has also represented celebrities seeking privacy injunctions.

Mr Axon – who ironically now delivers speeches about workplace bullying – is being represented by leading libel lawyers Carter-Ruck.

The 49-year-old was an officer in the Royal Navy from 1986 until 2004 when he was abruptly removed from his command of the Type 23 frigate HMS Somerset at Gibraltar after a six-month tour of the Gulf. 

First, a male junior officer had used a 24-hour helpline to complain that Mr Axon’s style of leadership amounted to bullying. A female crew member later came forward with similar claims.

After a ‘confidential internal equal opportunities investigation’, Mr Axon was told his position in the ship was ‘untenable’. He was given a desk job and later received a ‘censure’ – a formal written warning to remain on his file for five years.

Meanwhile, Ms Jordan-Barker ‘unlawfully and corruptly disclosed’ details to The Sun. She was paid £5,000 for the information and the paper published two stories about Mr Axon in December 2004.

According to the writ, only a handful of senior naval figures knew about what had happened and all MoD employees ‘had a duty to keep the information confidential’.

Mr Axon’s lawyers claim: ‘In corruptly disclosing the claimant’s [Mr Axon’s] information to The Sun newspaper, Ms Jordan-Barber was acting in the course of her employment with the defendant [the MoD] and the defendant is vicariously liable for her wrongdoing.’

This is because she ‘obtained the claimant’s information from other employees or from the defendant’s computers or filing systems’.

‘The wrongful conduct was, in all the circumstances, so closely connected with acts which Ms Jordan-Barber was authorised to carry out that the wrongful conduct could fairly and properly be regarded as being in the ordinary course of her employment.’

Mr Axon found out what had happened only last year when he was contacted by police investigating phone hacking and corrupt payments by newspapers. The high- profile trial of senior figures at The Sun and News of the World was told that Miss Jordan-Barker was paid more than £80,000 over five years for providing exclusive stories.

So far, at least ten police officers, prison guards and press officers have been charged with selling stories to newspapers under Scotland Yard’s Operation Elveden.

Lawyers now believe that even notorious criminals who had confidential details of their lives behind bars leaked by corrupt prison guards could serve writs against the Ministry of Justice.

Media lawyer David Banks said: ‘This would seem to open a real can of worms. This case is the trigger for others in this situation to take action. Even a criminal who has information leaked by a prison officer about them could say it is a breach of confidence.’

An MoD spokesman said: ‘Due to ongoing legal proceedings, it would be inappropriate for us to comment.’ Mr Axon could not be reached for comment.
