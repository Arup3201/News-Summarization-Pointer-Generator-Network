In the wake of a Bachelor Australia frenzy, one personal trainer from Melbourne has decided to set up his own real-life version of the dating competition.

Disillusioned with conventional dating methods, Luke D’Astoli, 34, created a Facebook page called Get Lucky With Luke, which he plans to use  to meet and greet eight female candidates.

At the culmination, he plans to choose a spouse.

Luke D’Astoli, 34, created a Facebook page called Get Lucky With Luke, which he plans to use to find a spouse

The page, which was created last Sunday, has already garnered 500 likes and a torrent of media coverage.

Mr D’Astoli was fed up meeting women in the usual places and wanted to try something new.

‘I knew I needed to meet some people. Most of the time I was meeting partners through work which is obviously not ideal, and I don’t really do the whole nightlife thing anymore.'

‘I also get a bad impression from dating sites and Tinder. It’s so time consuming, and I don’t think rejecting people to that degree is really very healthy.'

When asked if his page was not going to involve a likewise process of rejection, he replied ‘not at all. This is going to have some proper interaction, rather than just mindlessly swiping away.’

‘Plus, this way I get to be the centre of the operation, rather than just being one in the thousands online.’ 

Mr D’Astoli runs his own personal training business in Melbourne. He says that finding romance through work is 'not ideal'

Mr D’Astoli says he has already found some possible romantic matches, and he plans to set some dates in the next week

Mr D’Astoli says his friends have been very supportive, with scores of them sharing the page and tagging potential partners. 

And he’s already found prospective matches.

‘I've already had some promising contacts who I plan to meet with. I'll be setting a time and seeing who is available on the day, then using the advice of some close friends to narrow down the process after the date.’

When asked if he was concerned the criticism Blake from the Bachelor received for embarking on a comparable venture, he said ‘there are parallels, but ultimately I think those bachelor guys act pretty ingenuine. If you’re straightforward and act with authenticity, I think you can’t go wrong.’

Mr D’Astoli plans to start posting a date schedule in the next week.
