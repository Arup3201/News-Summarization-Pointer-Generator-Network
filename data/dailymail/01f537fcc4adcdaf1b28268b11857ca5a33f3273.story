Jos Buttler announced himself on the Test-match stage with a spectacular debut knock that provided the fireworks on day two of the third Investec Test.

Earlier this season the wicketkeeper, 23, said he was ‘not ready’ for Test cricket but Matt Prior’s replacement looked to the manor-born with a swashbuckling 85 including three sixes.

Buttler was lucky to escape being given out caught on nought but went on to add 106 for the sixth wicket with centurion Ian Bell, who returned to form with 156 as England declared their first innings on 569 for seven.

Dream debut: Jos Buttler scored 85 with the bat during his first Test appearance

Rampant: His superb knock against India consisted of three sixes

Partnership: He and centurion Ian Bell managed to put on 106 for the sixth wicket

‘Jos was outstanding,’ Bell said. ‘I think he nicked one that didn’t carry and looked like he was thinking a bit too much.

'We spoke about him just playing using his natural instincts. ‘We know how much potential he has.

'That ODI hundred he got against Sri Lanka (earlier this season) at Lord’s was as good a hundred as you’ll ever see in one day cricket.

'With a platform like that he’s as exciting a young player as can be. It’s exciting for us.’
