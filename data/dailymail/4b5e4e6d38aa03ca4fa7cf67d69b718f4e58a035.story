The taxpayer funded £140million in bonuses to civil servants last year, despite government promises to crackdown on Whitehall pay deals.

Treasury minister Danny Alexander vowed to end bonuses for ‘run of the mill performance’ as George Osborne cut billions from department’s budgets.

But new figures reveal that in some agencies and quangos every single member of staff received a bonus worth thousands of pounds.

Payouts: In the last year civil servants have received £140million in bonuses, despite deep cuts in Whtiehall

The pay-outs were condemned as unfair irresponsible by unions and MPs at a time when the government was demanding austerity.

The Cabinet Office revealed that 160,000 civil servants, around 40 per cent of the total workforce, received bonuses last year, costing the taxpayer £140million.

Some of the pay-outs were worth up to £62,000 with most receiving several hundred pounds.

A quarter of the 3,600 senior civil servants shared bonuses worth £8.6million alone.

Mark Sewotka, head of the PCS union which represents junior staff, said: ‘These bonuses are unfair, favour the highest paid and are often discriminatory.

‘The civil service bonus system should be scrapped entirely with the money put back into basic pay to give everyone a proper pay rise.’

The biggest bonus bill was at the Department for Work and Pensions, where almost £45million was paid out to nine in 10 staff.

More than 60 senior officials received an average of £10,000, despite mounting criticism of the department’s handling of benefits reforms.

A spokesman insisted the average bonus for staff earning less than £25,000 was between £500 and £600. ‘Those frontline staff ensure that the welfare system runs day in, day out for the benefit of millions of citizens’, he added.

The Ministry of Defence gave officials bonuses worth £24millon. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs - under pressure over its response to the winter floods - paid £2.6million.

The Met Office, which predicted a 'drier than usual' winter before being hit by the wettest winter on record, paid out £1.5million

The Department of Education spent £1.7million, Department for International Development £1.2million, Department of Health £900,000, Department for Transport £1.2million, Department for Energy and Climate £250,000 and Communities and Local Government £210,000.

Labour MP John Mann told the Mirror: 'There is a culture deep-rooted in banking , which has spread into this government, of seeing huge bonuses as justifiable and necessary. They are not.

'Across the country people work hard without receiving a large bonus and it is their taxes that are paying for the latest greedy bonuses.

'George Osborne needs to curb the culture of excessive bonuses.'

In 2012 the coalition announced a crackdown on rewards for failure. Mr Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said at the time: ‘This is not about getting rid of performance pay. It is about making sure that performance pay is there for genuine excellence and not just run-of-the-mill performance.’

But last year’s £140million bonus pot was only £7million lower than the previous 12 months.

A Cabinet Office spokesman said: ‘Since 2010 the government has restricted performance related payments for senior civil servants to the top 25 per cent of performers, saving the taxpayer around £15 million. They are only paid to reward excellence.’
