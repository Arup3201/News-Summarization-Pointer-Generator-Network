Over 10,000 historic maps of New York have been scanned and made available online by the New York Public Library.

The library has also unveiled a radical new 'warping' feature that allows users to superimpose any of the maps onto modern-day New York to see changes.

It allows users to virtually fly around the maps, seeing just how Manhattan has evolved.

Although the maps are primarily of New York, the digital maps also include:

1,100 maps of the Mid-Atlantic United States and cities from the 16th to 19th centuries, mostly drawn from the Lawrence H. Slaughter Collection;

More than 700 topographic maps of the Austro-Hungarian empire created between 1877 and 1914

2,800 maps from state, county and city atlases (mostly New York and New Jersey)

More than 10,300 maps from property, zoning, topographic, but mostly fire insurance atlases of New York City dating from 1852 to 1922

More than 1,000 maps of New York City, its boroughs and neighborhoods, dating from 1660 to 1922.

'NYPL has now scanned nearly all of its public domain New York City atlases, a collection of now more than 10,000 maps,' Matt Knutzen of the library revealed in a blog post announcing the project.

He also revealed the 'warper' tool that allows the old maps to be put on top of new maps.

'We have also built a web tool where users both inside and outside the Library can virtually stretch old maps onto a digital model of the world Ã  la Google Maps or OpenStreetMap, thus creating a new copy that is not only aligned with spatial coordinates on the Earth, but normalized across the entire archive of old maps.'

The library worked with staff, volunteers, and interns, a group of roughly 1,500 participants worldwide to complete the ambitious project.

This is the first time the majority of the maps have been made available online.

The Library hopes to expand to project to create a 'historical Yelp' for New York, with everything from restaurant menus to pricing in stores from the city's past.

'If we have documents related to past times and past places (old maps), then we can create data to 'rebuild' those past times and past places.

'If we 'rebuild' old places in virtual space, we can then organize a universe of other information around those old places.

'Wouldnâ€™t it be great to have yelp.com and menupages.com, but for old restaurants and with old menus and prices? Or to have at least a smattering of old photos in a historical street view? Or to search the National Newspaper Digitization Project using a map interface?
