No return: Amanda Knox, pictured in Seattle in June, will not return for the murder re-trial in Italy

Amanda Knox will not return to Italy for a retrial in the murder of her roommate, it has emerged.

David Marriott, a spokesman for the Knox family, told CNN that the 26-year-old had never agreed to attend the re-trial and that there is 'no requirement she be there'.

But she could still be forced to return to Italy if the country requires her extradition from the United States, the network reported.

In an interview in May, Knox expressed her fear and uncertainty about returning to the country where she was held in prison for several years for the murder of her roommate, 21-year-old Meredith Kercher.

'I'm afraid to go back there,' she told CNN. 'I don't want to go back to prison.'

Knox
was convicted of the November 2007 murder of the British exchange 
student, whose body was found in the villa they shared in Perugia, in 
central Italy.

Knox's 
then-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, was also found guilty of the 
killing. He received 25 years behind bars, while she was given 26 years.

But
the convictions were turned over in 2011 due to 'lack of evidence'. The
appellate court noted that the murder weapon was never found, said that
DNA tests were faulty and that prosecutors provided no murder motive.

Their
convictions had come despite a drifter from the Ivory Coast, Rudy 
Guede, being found guilty of the sexual assault and murder. He is 
currently serving a 30-year sentence.

After she was acquitted, Knox returned home to Seattle, Washington, where she remains.

But
last year, Italy's Supreme Court said the ruling was full of 
'deficiencies, contradictions and illogical' conclusions and ordered the
new appeals court to look at all the evidence.

The new court must conduct a full examination of evidence to resolve the ambiguities, the high court judges said.

They
said the new appeal process would serve to 'not only demonstrate the 
presence of the two suspects in the place of the crime, but to possibly 
outline the subjective position of Guede's accomplices'.

It
said hypotheses ran from a simple case of forced sex involving Kercher 
'to a group erotic game that blew up and got out of control'.

Knox has said that such claims were 'a bombardment of falsehood and fantasy'.

No date for the new trial has been set. Florence's appeals court was chosen since Perugia only has one appellate court.

Knox and Sollecito have both denied wrongdoing and said they weren't even in the apartment that night, although they acknowledged they had smoked marijuana and their memories were clouded.

Earlier this year, Knox said the future was very unsure for her financially and that she is almost broke because of her huge legal bills - despite a $1.5million book advance.

She will be paid a reported $4million in total for her memoir Waiting To Be Heard but claimed that her retrial and a potential libel lawsuits will leave her penniless.

Knox also revealed that to make money in the future she will be writing more books and will be taking a creative writing course at the University of Washington, near her home in Seattle.

But there 'is no requirement Knox be there', according to a spokesman

Italy could still require her to be extradited from the U.S.
