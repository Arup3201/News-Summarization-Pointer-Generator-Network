Convicted: Angela Douglas, 49, was jailed for life after smothering her mother with a pillow when she went to take her tea and biscuits

A mother-of-two who cooked Sunday lunch for her family before going upstairs to murder her own mother was jailed for life yesterday.

Angela Douglas had downed two-and-a-half bottles of wine when she smothered 73 year-old Anne Matthews with a pillow in Plymouth, Devon.

The 49-year-old claimed she was acting ‘out of love’ after watching her elderly mother struggle with emphysema.

But a court heard the pensioner, a former smoker who weighed less than five stone, was not terminally ill.

Douglas, a former nursery nurse, admitted killing her but denied murder and claimed a stress-related illness meant she was not in control of her own actions.

But a judge at Plymouth Crown Court told her she would be behind bars for at least 12 years after jurors found her guilty of murder in less than an hour.

Judge Graham Cottle said alcohol 'was a major factor' in Douglas' decision to kill her mother, and was not a result of mental illness.

The court heard how Douglas and her partner Shane had visited her mother and father David, 72, last April.

She cooked the family Sunday lunch, drank wine and took her mother a cup of tea and biscuits in bed.

Her father then went upstairs and found her kneeling and crying over her unconscious mother.

An ambulance was called but, when paramedics entered her bedroom, Douglas told them: 'I don’t want you to do anything, she’s been through enough.'

The medics also noted that Douglas was drunk and slurring her words. Further tests found she was heavily intoxicated.

During the trial the jury was told that no one had heard Anne Matthews ever speak about euthanasia.

Her husband David told the court she was a Catholic lady and would not have spoken of ending her life in that way.

Judge Cottle added: 'There was no doubt that she was in failing health.

Douglas, pictured arriving at an earlier court hearing, denied murdering her mother, saying she did it 'out of love'

'Her health had significantly deteriorated in the months or so before she died.

'Of much greater significance in the context of what happened later you were drinking and drinking heavily.

'Your were seriously under the influence of drink at the time you killed your mother, a factor which is significant in your decision to do what you did.'

Judge Cottle said he had 'no doubt' Douglas was overwhelmed by the sight of her mum’s suffering and that her decision was spontaneous and not premeditated.

But he told her: 'The fact that her lifespan was in any view short did not make her life any less precious.

'It was a life protected by the law and you took the selfish decision to end it.

'Your genuine remorse will live with you until the end of your days and that in itself is a very substantial punishment.'

Trial: Plymouth Crown Court heard that, even though Mrs Matthews weighed less than five stone, she was not terminally ill

Prosecutor Martin Meeke QC said Mrs. Matthews, who had two other daughters, had been battling chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

She was released from hospital a couple of weeks before her death before being visited at home by a social worker and an occupational therapist.

He said Douglas confessed to her partner that she had put a pillow over her mum’s face and killed her.

Douglas, a shop worker, called the police herself within hours of the incident and was arrested.

When questioned she told them she killed her mother 'out of love' because she didn’t want to see her suffer.

She told them: 'I tried to kill my mother. I smothered her with a pillow. I love my mum, I can’t stand to see her like that.'

Psychiatrist Dr Michael Alcock told the court that Douglas, of Plymouth, Devon, was suffering from a recognised mental disorder called 'adjustment disorder' when she 'snapped' and killed her mother.

However a second expert, consultant forensic psychiatrist Dr John Sandford, said there was no evidence to suggest she was suffering from the stress-related medical condition.

As Douglas was taken away to begin her sentence - gently supported on each side by court security - one of her sons cried out from the public gallery 'love you mum'.
