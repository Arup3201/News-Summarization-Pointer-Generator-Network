Hot-tempered chef Gordon Ramsay is facing a kitchen nightmare of his own.

The celebrity chef has been hit with a class-action lawsuit from past employees of his new Fat Cow restaurant in Los Angeles.

They're claiming the cranky cook failed to pay minimum wages for the hours they worked as well as meal breaks, overtime wages and more.

Kitchen nightmare: The Fat Cow restaurant is Los Angeles has only been open for eight months yet it is now facing its second lawsuit where employees are alleging non-payment of wages including tips and overtime

Fat Cow: Employees of the restaurant can think of worse insults to call Gordon Ramsey than the name of the restaurant

In documents obtained by RadarOnline.com Jennifer Becerra, Montinique Dever, Andrea Bourke and Lauren Benge are bringing the lawsuit on behalf of themselves as the other hourly employees.

'During the Class Period, Defendants have:

(1) required Class Members to work through their meal and rest periods without paying compensation for missed meal and rest breaks;

(2) failed to pay Class Members minimum wages for all hours worked;

(3) failed to pay Class Members premium compensation for all overtime hours worked;

(4) failed to pay Class Members all wages due at termination and/or resignation,' the documents state.

'(5) failed to maintain and provide Class Members with proper documentation concerning their hours worked and their compensation;

(6) committed unfair business practices in an effort to increase profits and to gain an unfair business advantages at the expense of the Class Members and the public.'

Allegations: The suit, filed on behalf of all hourly employees who worked for the restaurant since it was opened in October said the eatery failed to give them breaks or pay them minimum wage and overtime

The Fat Cow is a Ramsay-owned restaurant in Los Angeles’ Grove outdoor shopping center.

Most of the plaintiffs worked as servers or baristas between October 2012 and March of this year.

They are asking for a jury trial and 'an award of economic damages.'

Ramsay’s spokesperson told Radar: 'We are aware there was a problem with previous management which has since been changed, but this is totally unacceptable if any truth to it.'

Gordon's people: Ramsay's staff have said they were aware of a problem with previous management which has since been changed and agree the situation was totally unacceptable

It's not the first time Ramsay's 'Fat Cow' restaurant has been the subject of lawsuits.

Earlier this year, the place was sued for not paying a contractor in full with the shouty chef owing a contractor $45,350 for kitchen equipment.

Fiery Gordon has become a hit in the US after his shows, Hell's Kitchen and Kitchen Nightmares were syndicated to US TV network Fox.

The expletive-ridden show  follows the chef as he aims to turn around failing restaurants.

Gordon and his team often overhaul the menu, the decor and even the staff, though many of them end up closing a few months later despite his best efforts.

His job as the host of Hell's Kitchen, MasterChef and Kitchen Nightmares, pays him an estimated $15 million per year.

Gordon Ramsay is the owner of 27 restaurants and holds 11 Michelin stars.
