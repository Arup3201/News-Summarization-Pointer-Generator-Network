You could own a slice of Aussie paradise, a sprawling beachfront mansion with the lot: dual-heated pool, tennis court, spa and your very own boathouse. But it will cost you $18 million.

That's how much a couple paid for this palatial home in Brighton, in Melbourne's south east, after it was offered for only the second time at what's believed to a record price in the affluent 'golden mile'.

The modern looking double-storey mansion was put on the market three years ago by Wallace Cameron, the shareholder of a pathology company, and wife Joan, The Age reported.

A palace to call home: The double-story mansion was on the market for three years before reportedly selling for a reported $18 million

What a view: Looking onto Port Phillip Bay, the home is set among other luxury properties in an area known as the Golden Mile

Deluxe: The home's finishings are of the highest quality and it features a range of living areas boasting water views

It is believed the couple bought the stunning home for $5 million about 15 years ago.

In a reported off-market deal, the sale is said to have been finalised last week, in a purchase by retired businessman and philanthropist Julius Colman and wife Jadwiga.

Named Shannagolden, the luxurious home is one of the largest set among the desired stretch of homes known as the Golden Mile.

Set high at 12 Moule Avenue, the 35-year-old four-bedroom and five-bathroom house has undergone recent updates including a marble kitchen and stone-finished bathroom upgrade.

Spanning 85 square metres and offering an endless list of deluxe features, the home also boasts a dual-heated pool with spa and tennis court overlooking the bay.

With manicured lawns and gardens throughout the estate, it offers a boathouse and the yard sprawls onto its own  3903 square metres of beachfront.

Luxurious finishing inside the home include ornate columns, sunken living areas, contrasting tiled floors and plush carpets.

On the JP Dixon property listing, the home is touted as existing in a 'world of its own at Melbourne's most privileged beachfront address' set at the end of its own tree-lined avenue.

The double-garage manor also features an entertainer's bar, formal and casual living areas and grand formal dining room.

The library/study is one of one two rooms in the whole mansion to not have sweeping view of the bay.

The agents selling the home confirmed it had sold but have not revealed the price it was bought for

Sought-after: The property is located in the Melbourne suburb of Brighton, about 11km south east of the CBD. The area is one of the wealthiest in the city and features some its most grand homes

If the home did sell for $18 milllion, that is about $2.5 million more than the previous record for a mansion in Brighton. It would have also attracted state government stamp duty of approximately $990,000.

Cricketer Shane Warne bought a four-bedroom home in Kinane Street, Brighton earlier this month for about $4 million.

The purchase followed the sale of his Italianate mansion Kilkerran at 6 William Street, Brighton, for $10.85 million.
