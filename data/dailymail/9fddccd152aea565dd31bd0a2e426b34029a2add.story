Legendary magicians Siegfried & Roy have welcomed three new snowy white lion cubs to their Secret Garden habitat on the Las Vegas Strip.

The 14-week-old felines were born near Johannesburg, South Africa, and brought to the Mirage casino three weeks ago. They will be available for public viewing starting on Friday.

'Millions of people each year visit the Secret Garden and are awed by these great creatures,' Siegfried Fischbacher, 75, said in a statement.

'One by one, we are raising awareness for the plight of rare and endangered animals - our true mission.'

The brothers are named Freedom, Madiba - the tribal name of Nelson Mandela - and Timba-Masai, which combines the names of the Timbavati region of South Africa and the name of the Masai tribe that lives there.

attacked Horn during a 2003 performance, leaving him partially 
paralyzed.

Horn and 
Fischbacher have said they believe Mantecore sensed Horn was having a 
mini-stroke and was dragging him to safety, rather than attacking him.

Animal experts have disputed that theory.

Horn was told he would never walk, talk or perform magic again, but defied all odds to make a remarkable recovery, despite having to have part of his brain cut away, suffering a crushed windpipe and being partially paralyzed.

After a two-year review, federal investigators never determined what set off the tiger, who died on March 19 this year, aged 17.

During Horn's long rehabilitation, both he and Fischbacher remained devoted to The Secret Garden and Dolphin Habitat, their exotic habitat on the Las Vegas Strip that houses lions, tigers and leopards.

The attraction now features 13 tigers and six lions.
