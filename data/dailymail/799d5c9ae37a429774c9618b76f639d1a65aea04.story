Birds Eye and Taco Bell have admitted for the first time that their beef in the UK contains horsemeat after it was found in three of their products.

Birds Eye had previously withdrawn the ready meals as a precaution after horse DNA was found in chilli con carne in Belgium.

But the latest rounds of tests show that Birds Eye traditional spaghetti bolognese and beef lasagne contain at least 1 per cent horsemeat.

Birds Eye have confirmed for the first time that two of their products contain horse meat DNA

Mexican fast food restaurant Taco Bell have also found horse DNA in their ground beef taco filling.

All products have now been withdrawn from sale.

Birds eye released a statement that said: ' As a precautionary measure last week in the UK and Ireland we withdraw all other beef products produced by the same supplier, namely Traditional Spaghetti Bolognese 340g, Shepherd’s Pie 400g and Beef Lasagne 400g. 

IKEA were forced to withdraw their meatballs in the midst of the scandal

'We have now conducted further tests on these products and discovered the Spaghetti Bolognese and Beef Lasagne products did contain low levels of horse DNA.

'Going forward we are introducing a new on-going DNA testing programme that will ensure no minced beef meat product can leave our facilities without first having been cleared by DNA testing.'

Taco Bell, which has three UK franchises, has not been involved in the scandal until now.

A spokesperson for Taco Bell said: 
'Once we learned of this issue, we immediately voluntarily tested our 
product for our 3 Taco Bell restaurants in the UK. 

'Based on that 
testing, we learned ingredients supplied to us from one supplier in 
Europe tested positive for horsemeat.

'We immediately withdrew it from 
sale, and discontinued purchase of that meat and contacted the FSA with 
this information.

'We apologise to our customers and take this matter 
very seriously as food quality is our highest priority.'

The tests, which is the third round since the start of the meat scandal, also found horse meat in catering supplier Brakes' spicy minced beef skewer.

Brakes supply food to the House of Commons.

This is the latest development in the horsemeat scandal that has shaken the food industry.

Authorities across Europe have started doing random DNA checks after traces of horse meat turned up in frozen supermarket meals such as burgers and lasagna beginning last month.

The European Union's agriculture ministers gathered in Brussels to discuss the widening scandal's fallout, with some member states pressing for tougher rules to regain consumer confidence.

Meanwhile, McDonald's has confirmed tests for horsemeat in its products came back negative.

Jill McDonald, the president and chief executive of McDonald's UK, said: 'We voluntarily provided samples of all beef burgers currently available on our menu to the Food Standards Agency (FSA) for their own tests.

'All tests, including our own, have now been completed and we can confirm that no horsemeat has been found in any of McDonald's products.

'Our beef supply chain is short and transparent and has just five simple steps from the farms through to the food we serve in our restaurants. Thanks to this, our customers can continue to trust in the quality of food at McDonald's.'

The latest developments come as shoppers are abandoning the frozen food aisles as sales of burgers and ready meals plummet in the wake of the horsemeat scandal.

Frozen burger sales are down by 43 per 
cent  and frozen ready meals by 13 per cent since traces of horse DNA 
were first found in products on sale in Britain on January 16

'Only Fools Eat Horses'.

The sign, which references comedy 'Only Fools eat Horses' has grabbed the attention of the city, with people posing to get pictures with it and posting them on Facebook.

Mr Wright said: 'It just came to me in my sleep and I thought it was funny.

'After we had the banner made people started stopping and taking pictures of it. There are loads on the internet and we didn't even put them there.'

The butchers has been in that premises since 1882, and is a long established local outlet.

He added: 'People are changing their minds. They want the best mince, the best beef. They want quality meat and to know what it is.

'Companies were chasing price, they wanted the cost to go further and further down. but in the end they have to ask if they are willing to sacrifice quality for cheaper meat.

'People want to know where their food comes from now.'
