Posing by a sun-drenched pool with barely an inch of make-up on, Michelle Keegan proves she's the ultimate beach babe in her latest holiday snaps.

The actress and fashion designer is currently enjoying a holiday with fiance, Mark Wright - and judging by their poolside snaps, her pre-wedding healthy lifestyle is working wonders. 

Michelle, 27, has been showcasing a toned and tanned body ahead of her nuptials - and now she's revealed the secrets behind her enviable physique.

Sharing her beauty secrets on her Hello! blog, Michelle said she swears by a gold dust-infused face mask for keeping her skin glowing.

'I tried one of these peel off face masks by CASMARA,' she said.

'All of them help restore and illuminate damaged skin. In addition they are paraben-free, which is always good. The mask only takes 20 minutes to put on and I have to say my face felt like I had just enjoyed a full on spa facial . Very impressed.' 

The star is also a fan of the celebrity-favoured Embryolisse moisturszer, which literally translates as 'baby's bottom' and is a cult French product that promises to leave skin super smooth.

The £20 cream is praised by make-up artists and beloved of stars including Gwyneth Paltrow, Scarlett Johansson and Yasmin Le Bon. 

One tube of the cream sells every 60 seconds worldwideand celebrity make-up artist, Julia Carta, described it as the ‘best kept secret among models and make-up artists’.

Michelle also exfoliates with a Beauty Lab creamy facial polish and uses an Origins Renewal Serum to refine her pores, smooth her skin out and give her visage a subtle glow.

By night, she uses Scott Barnes Body Bling Original Moisturizing Shimmering Body Lotion on her legs and to add a subtle glow to her cheeks. 

In terms of her diet, Michelle has been using the SoulMateFood delivery service and says she  will be continuing the healthy eating plan when she comes back to Manchester while  filming over the next couple of weeks.

Michelle finally revealed her SS15 range for Lipsy in full this month and she showed off her summer body and tan in the imagery, which was shot on a sun-drenched beach

Bodywise, Michelle says she tries to work out as much as possible and whilst there's 'always an excuse not to go', she ends up feeling better after a workout.

'I try and go to the gym as much as I can,' she told FEMAIL recently. 'It could be three times a week or not at all one week, but I don't punish myself if I don't go.'

The pint-sized star has been working hard in the design studio in between her acting gigs to make sure every piece in her range is spot on for summer

The 27-year-old star recently showed off her enviable physique, glowing tan and summer designs for Lipsy in a recent campaign shoot.

The former Coronation Street star, whose collections have been a stellar success for the brand, has been hard at work in the design studio to bring fans exactly what they want for the warmer months. 

As the clothes horse shows, her new range is full of colourful print playsuits, cool crochet and lots of sophisticated lace.

Speaking to FEMAIL about her new drop, the actress, model and fashion designer said: 'One of my favourite parts of summer is being able to experiment with brand new styles and colours.

'It’s the easiest season to wear fresh statement brights and hot new prints. I also love soft earthy shades such as nude and taupe complemented by sun kissed skin.' 

Michelle says she doesn't punish herself if she doesn't work out as she showcases her enviable body

Her new range is full of beach attire, including cover-ups and brightly coloured bikinis

In summer, Michelle opts for a minimal beauty regime and says having a good moisturiser is an essential 

Michelle has recently finished filming on her new TV show, Ordinary Lies, her first major role since quitting ITV soap Coronation Street.

The actress used to play Tina McIntyre on Corrie's cobbles but has switched allegiances to the BBC where she'll portray car showroom receptionist Tracy in the new six-part series.

As well as her career coup, Michelle is looking forward to tying the knot to her man, who previously revealed they are getting married in Norfolk later this year.
