Duncan Edwards was my idol in the fifties... I was devastated after the Munich air disaster

Harry Redknapp is one of the game’s most colourful and outspoken characters.

Here, in the final part of his brilliant book, he reflects on a footballing world before pilates, ice baths and prima donnas.

Lionel Messi reminds me of George Best, the way he would run with the ball tight to his foot. Tap, tap, tap. He would take the ball up to defenders like that, and then swivel and go past them.

There were so many great players in that Manchester United team but, even then, George stood tall.

He was fresh off the boat and straight into the first team. He didn’t really bother with youth football. I can remember reading the account by Harry Gregg, Manchester United’s goalkeeper, of the first time he met George.

Great man, Harry — pulled semi-conscious injured team-mates out of a burning plane on the runway at Munich. That’s bravery. These days a midfielder receives the ball with a man marking him and we say he’s brave.

Harry was also a hard man who almost used to bully opponents. Not the sort of chap that a young kid fresh over from Belfast should be messing with.

The first training session George had at United, he got the ball, ripped through the defence and made to shoot. Gregg went one way, and George casually took the ball past him and rolled it into the net.

Next attack, the same thing happened. ‘Do that to me again, son,’ Harry warned, from his position on the seat of his pants, ‘and you won’t be playing tomorrow.’ Yet George just laughed it off. That was what made him so magnificent.

There is a fantastic clip of George playing against Chelsea. He is going through the defence, the mud is ankle deep, when Ron Harris comes across and tries to cut him in half. George rides it, carries on and slots the ball in.

George went out every game knowing there were players whose job was to hurt him, who actively tried to break his legs. Yet they never stopped him demanding the ball, never stopped him running with it. I haven’t seen anybody as brave as George.

He was the best; he had a style, a swagger when he played, that I don’t think I’ve seen since. And he changed football. Girls screaming at him, boys trying to dress like him.

There were other good players and good teams but also a pub mentality that didn’t really leave English football until the influx of foreign players. From the great Liverpool team to the World Cup-winning England side and the King’s Road lot at Chelsea, just about every club liked a night out.

Most of the teams were made up of local boys and they all got on great. At West Ham we mucked in together and roughed it when we had to.

I remember the terrible winter in 1963, clearing the snow off the forecourt at Upton Park with the rest of the players so we could train. Job done, we’d play on it for two hours in silly little plimsolls, sliding everywhere. These days, the medical staff would have conniptions about the damage you could do to your calf muscles. But nobody knew, or cared, about that side of the game.

These days, if a training pitch isn’t like Wembley, the players complain. Modern players moan about everything. They’ll walk into a room with £200,000 of equipment and find some fault — no bananas in the fruit bowl or the temperature isn’t right.

We used to spend a month running through forests, dodging cars on the Epping New Road. That was our pre-season. Get back on the coach with everybody cramping up. Nobody had heard of stretching exercises. We didn’t even warm up.

The first time we saw the pitch was when the bell went to signal two minutes before kick-off. We might take the odd shot against the goalkeeper if we were feeling adventurous. There was no such thing as a warm-up. We thought a warm-up was standing by the radiator.

Once the game started, if you went down, a bloke would come out, put a sponge on your leg and that was the extent of his knowledge done. No one complained. We didn’t know any different, we just got on with it.

There were no agents to stir up a fuss. Contract negotiation was non-existent. The manager called you into his office and gave you another £2 a week and you went home delighted.

Where are poor Paul Gascoigne's friends now he needs their help?

Dalglish had West Ham stars standing and applauding at 15... then he signed for Celtic!

Alan Hansen reminded me of Bobby Moore, that's why he's in my team of the Eighties 

John Robertson, Kevin Keegan and Phil Neal make my team of the Seventies 

Giggs would have solved England's problems... he was born to play left wing 

Wenger heralded a change... he introduced Prozone and scouting reports to England

Ravel Morrison has the class of Bale but his attitude is holding back his talent 

Vieira and Keane are warriors... they were even prepared to do battle while on TV!

I was fortunate to spend the Sixties working for one of the greatest football minds this country has ever produced: Ron Greenwood.

It is no exaggeration to say that Ron changed the game in England. I remember watching the 1966 World Cup and I was able to pinpoint the moves and tactics that were straight from West Ham’s training ground.

People talk about master coaches in football and I’ll be frank and say I haven’t seen too many; but Ron was among the few.

The way England got Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters to get across defenders at the near post — I would credit Ron for that.

The goals that England scored in 1966 were no accident. I used to watch Ron work for hours with the pair of them — when to pull away, how to time the return run.

A lot of what Ron did stands up today. I’m not ashamed to admit that I still use lessons from Ron.
