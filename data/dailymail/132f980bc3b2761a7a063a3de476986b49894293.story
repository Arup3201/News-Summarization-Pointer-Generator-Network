A woman accused of abducting her baby daughter en route to a birthday party  and fleeing to Australia will be extradited to the United States after almost 20 years on the run.

Dorothy Lee Barnett, 53, was found and arrested in Queensland last year after she disappeared with her 10-month-old baby from South Carolina in 1994.

The federal government has ordered that Ms Barnett be surrendered to US authorities to face international parental kidnapping charges, despite an appeal from her lawyers.

Ms Barnett was found by Australian and US police in November living on the Sunshine Coast with her daughter Savanna Todd, now aged 20, living under the name Samantha Geldenhuys.

She allegedly did not have custody of Savanna when she took her from her American father to attend a birthday party and failed to return in 1994.

Ms Barnett and Savanna's father Benjamin Harris Todd separated in 1993, with the mother being granted two supervised weekend visits a month for their daughter.

It's alleged Ms Barnett abducted their daughter on the fifth visitation.

When she was arrested Ms Barnett initially agreed to be extradited but she later backed down.

Her lawyers asked the government to prevent the extradition, but Federal Justice Minister Michael Keenan ruled this week she had to be surrendered, the ABC reports.

'The Minister arrived at his determination following careful consideration of the provisions of Australia’s extradition law and taking into account representations made by, and on behalf of, Ms Barnett,' a government spokesperson said.

'In August 2014, the Minister for Justice determined that Ms Barnett is to be surrendered to the United States.'

She could face more than 10 years in jail if convicted of the charges, including international parental kidnapping and passport-related offences.

Ms Barnett has been in custody since she was arrested in November.

She was by Ms Barnett's side during a court appearance at the time she was arrested and denied bail.

Savanna - who has been studying nursing at a Queensland 
university - held up a sign during the hearing saying 'We love you Mum'.

Ms Barnett,
 who 'winked' back at her daughter, was supported by over two dozen 
people, some of whom had sworn affidavits attesting to her good 
character.

Barnett's 
barrister, Jeff Hunter QC, said his client was not a flight risk and had
 a close and special relationship with the Sunshine Coast community.

She has maintained a job while in Australia and managed to get a mortgage on her home.

Ms Barnett reportedly initially fled to South Africa with her daughter where she married a man named Juan Geldenhuys in 1995. She later gave birth to a son, now 17, before moving to New Zealand and becoming a citizen. 

After splitting with her second husband, Ms Barnett moved to Queensland with her two children.

Police allege she used several aliases to evade detection.

Court documents say Savanna's father was the one who led authorities to find his ex-wife.

Mr Todd was contacted by an Australian friend of Mr Geldenhuys, Ms Barnett's second husband, who had grown suspicious of her.

He heard Ms Barnett call her daughter Savanna and she had previously spoken about escaping an abusive relationship.

A simple internet search by the man provided old photos of Ms Barnett as wanted in relation to the disappearance of Savanna.

In an affidavit tendered to the court, Savanna described Barnett as 'an amazing woman, having raised both myself and my brother and always giving us the support we needed to become the people that we are'.
