Gary Neville surveyed Tottenham's right-side and described it as a 'graveyard' after it was torn apart in the first-half by Manchester United.

The problem for England coach Neville and his boss Roy Hodgson, who was at Old Trafford, was that this graveyard shift was manned by four Englishmen: Kyle Walker, Andros Townsend, Ryan Mason and Eric Dier.

Like Harry Kane and Danny Rose, also in the Spurs team, they had been hoping to deliver the type of display which might catch Hodgson's eye for the right reasons after he had changed his plans and hit the north, rather than go to Chelsea.

The England squad will be named on Thursday for games against Lithuania and Italy and although Kane is certain to be involved, despite failing to make an impact in the 3-0 defeat at Manchester United when his first effort on goal came in the 89th minute.

Spurs defended terribly and were killed off by three first-half goals before completing the game in something of a daze as United coasted home and it damages their hopes of finishing in the top four and reaching the Champions League.

Mauricio Pochettino dubbed it the worst performance since he arrived at White Hart Lane last summer and promised to examine what went wrong before they return to action against Leicester on Saturday.

'I am not disappointed with the result but I am worried about the performance,' said Pochettino. 'You can lose here but the performance was very poor. We need to analyse and try to fix that. We're all disappointed. Not only me. But all the team. We need to understand why it happened. We need to fix it. That maybe the poorest we've played this season.

'We came, ready to compete but from the beginning it was difficult. We didn't play our normal way. The first half was poor and at 3-0 it is difficult to come back.

'We tried to play forward as is our philosophy, but it is difficult when you concede and make a lot of mistakes. Individually and collectively, we were very poor and that's why we lost the game. The key factor was us. We were the key factor in the game.

'We didn't deliver a good performance. We made a lot of mistakes. We never found our way to play and allowed Manchester United to play.'

Townsend was hauled off after half an hour and replaced by Mousa Dembele as Pochettino tried to get hold of possession as they were being over-run by United in midfield. 'It was not because Andros was poor,' he said. 'We tried to change to keep the ball.'

Soon after the switch, a mistake by Nabil Bentaleb presented Wayne Rooney with the third goal and Tottenham's fate was sealed before the break.

Mason also came off, early in the second half with a 'knock' while Emmanuel Adebayor returned for his first appearance since January as a late substitute. Adebayor was back in the squad because Roberto Soldado hurt his knee in training, on Saturday. Pochettino said Soldado's injury was 'not serious'.
