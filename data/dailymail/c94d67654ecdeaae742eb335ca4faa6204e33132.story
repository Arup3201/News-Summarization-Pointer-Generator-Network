A 35-year-old father who died of an aggressive brain tumor handled his death with humor - by comparing his battle with the disease to a living a double-life as Spider-Man.

Aaron Purmort, from Minneapolis, was diagnosed with a glioblastoma in 2011, and died this week - but not before writing his own obituary along with his wife, Nora.

The piece, published Sunday in the Minneapolis Star Tribune, phrased his life in terms of Peter Parker's famous alter-ego, with cancer as the villain he tried to defeat.

'Spider-Man': Aaron Purmont's obituary, published Sunday in the Minneapolis Star Tribune, compares him to a superhero who fought cancer

Documented: Nora Purmont, above with Aaron, wrote a blog detailing her husband's struggle with the disease

It described his death as the result of 'complications from a radioactive spider bite that led to years of crime-fighting and a years long battle with a nefarious criminal named Cancer, who has plagued our society for far too long.'

'Civilians will recognize him best as Spider-Man, and thank him for his many years of service protecting our city.

'His family knew him only as a kind and mild-mannered Art Director, a designer of websites and t-shirts, and concert posters who always had the right cardigan and the right thing to say (even if it was wildly inappropriate).'

The piece then goes on to describe his career, his childhood and his family, including his son, Ralph, who is almost two.

The obituary says he will grow up to 'avenge' him, and Ralph now associates his father with the superhero.

Speaking to MailOnline about the obituary, Nora said: 'Living with cancer is no battle - you show up and hope you don't die is the battle.

'What sets Aaron apart is not just the obituary but literally the entire way he lived his life. He had this unbridled joy about him.

'We spent so much time in hospital, where mostly other people are in terrible moods and feel sorry for themselves, and Aaron didn't feel spend one second of his entire 35 years on earth feeling sorry for himself.

'When we were writing this we were laughing so hard, we had to take some parts out... We had so much fun these past three years.

'A lot of the stuff we went through was pretty terrible but it didn't feel as bad as it looked'.

Nora said Ralph, who will have his second birthday in January, now associates her father with Spider-Man, a comic-book figure his father loved well into adulthood. 

She said: 'The night that we told our family Aaron was going into the hospice, Ralph walked over, crawled between us, hugged Aaron and just kept saying 'I love you, Papa. I love you, Papa''.

'I don't know what he knows - but I think he knows enough. Yesterday was the first time he asked me 'Where's Papa?'

Together: Nora said that the optimism with which Aaron lived his life is in keeping with the style of the obituary

'I said 'He's in your heart now, and he's in my heart. You won't see him with your eyes any more put you can feel him here. He just kept patting his heart and said 'OK!''

'And when he sees Spider-Man he says 'Papa!' - which is all Aaron ever wanted'.

During the progress of Aaron's disease, Nora, whom he married after the diagnosis, kept track of their life together on her blog.

In a post describing his last moments, she wrote: 'It ended today at 2:43pm, in the middle of a run-on sentence, my head on his heart and my arms around him in a hospital bed built for one, but perfect for the two of us.'

Family: The obituary mentioned that the couple's son, Ralph (center), will 'avenge' his father

'One quiet second': Nora Purmont movingly described her husband's last moments in a recent post - before revealing how the two co-wrote his obituary

'He breathed out, and I readied for the sharp inhale that would follow 8-10 seconds later, rattling through his body. It never came.

'That's how it ends. One quiet second.'

After the obituary was published today, she described how the two of them had agreed the text of the obituary towards the end of his life.

She said: 'Before [he] died, we had time to sit down and write his obituary. I've never laughed and cried more in one sitting, but I'm so glad we got to do this. I love this man so damn much.'

The family has also started a crowdfunding page to raise money to support the family in the future.
