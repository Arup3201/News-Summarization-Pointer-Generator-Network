A top lawyer who says she was attacked and gored by a rampaging elephant on a foot safari in Africa is suing the safari firm and her guide for more than £300,000 in compensation.

Caroline Pratte says she suffered abdominal wounds and multiple fractures when she was 'attacked' on holiday at the exclusive Lion Camp lodge, in South Luangwa National Park, Zambia, in October 2011.

The businesswoman’s partner Andrew Ness who saw the attack but was not physically hurt, says he suffered 'psychological injury' due to the trauma of witnessing Ms Pratte’s ordeal, and is also seeking damages.

The couple, who live in Monte Carlo, are suing British safari guide Samuel Grace, who was general manager of the lodge at the time, and led the foot safari during which Ms Pratte was injured.

She and Mr Ness, who have a son and run a charity for sick children alongside successful businesses, are also suing the companies that run Lion Camp.

The luxury lodge, which lies in Zambia’s second largest national park, provides high-end safari holidays for up to 18 guests, who pay up to £400-a-night to sleep in four poster beds and eat overlooking plains teaming with wildlife.

In a writ lodged at London’s High Court, lawyers for the couple say Ms Pratte was under the 'care, supervision and direction' of Mr Grace, or his employers, when she was attacked by the elephant on October 23 2011.

'Ms Pratte suffered the attack and Mr Ness witnessed it whilst on a walking safari with their family, that was led by Mr Grace, the general manager of the safari lodge,' the document states.

The couple’s lawyers allege Lion Camp is 'directly liable for the injuries loss and damage they sustained by reason of their own breaches of duty in relation to their safety or are vicariously liable for the acts and omissions of Mr Grace.'

The writ does not specify the total amount of damages claimed by the couple but confirms that they seek compensation 'in excess of £300,000.'

Safari guide Mr Grace, of Ealing, West London, was born in the UK but spent much of his childhood in South Africa, before returning to Britain to study for a degree in geography at the University of Wales.

He was the manager of Lion Camp for nine years, but has settled in London since Ms Pratte’s accident.

He currently works for an international safari company whose English offices are based in Dorking, Surrey.

The defence of Mr Grace and the companies to the action were not available from the court.

The allegations contained in the writ have yet to be tested in evidence before a judge.
