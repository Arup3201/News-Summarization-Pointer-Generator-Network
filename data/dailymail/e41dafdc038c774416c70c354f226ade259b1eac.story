Arrested: Manchester United's Ryan Tunnicliffe

Manchester United soccer star Ryan Tunnicliffe has been arrested on suspicion of drink-driving after crashing his £60,000 motor.

Tunnicliffe, 19, was held yesterday afternoon just hours after picking up the keys to the top of the range black Land Rover.

He allegedly hit a stationary van, pushing it 30ft into a wall, as he drove round an industrial estate in Heywood, Manchester.

The teenager, who made his first team debut for the Red Devils just weeks ago, was breathalysed and arrested at the scene.

Witnesses told the Sun that Tunniclife lost control of the vehicle when it skidded on the wet road. Part of the wall was demolished in the 2.15pm crash.

Onlooker Matthew Cronshaw, 27, told the paper: 'A mate told me he'd only just picked up the keys. He hit a van and pushed it into a wall, making a terrible screeching sound.

'He's hit it with real force because both vehicles looked like write-offs. Ryan looked really shaken up.'

Police confirmed to Mail Online that a driver had been arrested on suspicion of drink-driving.

Tunnicliffe made his debut for Manchester United as a 77th-minute substitute in the 2-1 Capital One Cup victory over Newcastle United - winning his father, Mick, £10,000.

When the midfielder, was nine years old his father placed the wager that his son would one day play for United, taking odds of 100-1 with a £100 bet.
