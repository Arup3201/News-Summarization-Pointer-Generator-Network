Bullied: This photo of blogger Carly Findlay was posted to Reddit on Wednesday (minus the writing), with many commenters mocking her appearance caused by a chronic skin condition

A blogger with a chronic skin disease bravely stood up to internet bullies who ridiculued her looks when her picture was posted on Reddit.

A Reddit user with the screen name 'roschleiche' shared a picture of Carly Findlay on a thread called 'WTF' on Wednesday.

Ms Findlay suffers from both Netherton's syndrome and erythroderma, causing her skin to inflame when exposed to the elements. In the picture her face appears shiny because she wears paraffin as protection

The Melbourne, Australia-based writer figured out that her image was posted to the site when she noticed an influx of traffic to her blog. 

Many of the comments made fun of Ms Findlay's appearance, comparing her to a glazed donut, a lobster and 'something that was partially digested by my dog'.

One commenter even said that Ms Findlay's smile looked fake.

'Seeing people like this smile makes me uncomfortable, It looks like a lie; they are only smiling in an attempt to fool themselves that their lives aren't horrible. You can see it in her eyes. The same rehearsed dead-eye mouth-smile in all her pictures. Gives me the willies.'

After reading through the nasty comments, Ms Findlay decided to enter thread.

Ms Findlay wrote that for years she didn't share pictures of herself online for fear that they would be used against her in this way.

Speaking out: Ms Findlay responded to the hate comments by entering the thread herself

Those feelings of anxiety stopped when she started blogging, and gained both confidence and a support system.

'The love I have around me and the success I have had through telling my own story to break down stigma like these Reddit threads is stronger than any of those words,' she wrote.

At the same time, Ms Findlay took the opportunity to thank the people who stood up for her on the thread.

'The level of kindness shown in these situations is always greater than the level of hate,' she said.

Sorry: After posting her response on Reddit, the user who originally posted her picture apologized

While many defended Ms Findlay before she entered the discussion, even more came out saying she was 'inspirational' and a 'champion' after.

The Redditer who originally posted the picture even apologized, though Ms Findlay beleives the apology was somewhat backhanded.

'I'm reading all this and I apologize! I was looking for "champagne fridge" on google images. When I saw your pictures, I thought "WTF!" and further: "allergic reaction", also your hair looks a bit of fire so I put it here. Hopefully you see it as a good promotion for your blog and chapeau to you for being awesome!' the poster wrote.

Ms Findlay wrapped up the entire experience in a post on her blog, writing: 'Today's comments on Reddit showed me that the Internet is full of pretty awful people. But it also showed me people are so kind, and are willing to learn.'
