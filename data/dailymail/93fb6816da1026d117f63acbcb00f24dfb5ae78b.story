'Superhead' on trial: Sir Alan Davies 
outside Southwark Crown Court where he pleaded not guilty to involvement in a £2.7million fraud

A knighted superhead and five of his former colleagues have today appeared in court charged with swindling their old school out of £2.7 million.

Sir Alan Davies, the 65-year-old former head of Copland Community School in Wembley, north west London is accused of conspiring to defraud the cash-strapped local authority.

He is to stand trial alongside Dr Richard Evans, 55, a former deputy head and education adviser to David Cameron, and the then chairman of governors Indravadan Patel, 73.

Former school bursar Columbus Udokoro, 62, HR manager Michele McKenzie, 53, and ex-vice chair of governors Martin Day, 58, are also said to be part of the alleged fraud.

All six appeared at Southwark Crown Court today where they pleaded not guilty to the charge, which centres on inappropriate payments said to have been paid out between April 2003 and June 2009.

Davies, who was decorated for his services to education, is said to have received more than £900,000 in ‘inappropriate payments’ while Dr Evans allegedly obtained £600,000.

Davies is also accused of one count of laundering £270,490 by transferring the sum from a NatWest bank account in England to a Spanish bank account in March 2008.

He is further charged with six counts of false accounting, said to have taken place between April 2007 and June 2009 - part of his alleged efforts to ‘cover up his activities’.

At a previous court hearing prosecutor David Levy told Westminster Magistrates Court that the total value of the fraud 'was in the region of £2.7m.'

Davies, who wore a grey suit, grey 
shirt and silver tie for today’s plea and case management hearing, spoke
only to confirm his name and deny the charges against him in a clear 
voice, which also include six counts of false accounting.

The
former superhead, who was decorated for his services to education, also
stands accused of transferring over £270,000 in criminal property 
between January and April 2008.

Former Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown both visited Coplands, while ex-deputy head Evans even acted as an educational advisor to current Prime Minister David Cameron, who also visited the school.

John Black QC, prosecuting, today told Southwark Crown Court that the charges of false accounting levelled against Sir Alan are 'outside the conspiracy' that his colleagues stand accused of.

He added: 'They were part of what the Crown say is a cover-up. We have already taken the view that they took place after the event [and were] intended to cover up his activities.'

Mr Black also revealed that the accusation of transferring criminal property - which sees Davies accused of switching £270,490 between a British and Spanish bank account - relate to the “proceeds of the conspiracy.”

Judge Anthony Leonard QC remanded all six on bail. They are due to stand trial at Southwark Crown Court on September 16th.
