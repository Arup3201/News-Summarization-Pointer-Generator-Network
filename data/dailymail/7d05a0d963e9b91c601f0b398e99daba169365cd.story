This is the dramatic moment that the lights went out in the middle of the Super Bowl on Sunday night, leaving officials looking out over 71,000 football fans with baffled expressions.

A TV network had been holding an interview behind-the scenes at the Superdome control room in New Orleans when a power cut rippled around the stadium.

An eerie calm descended in the tower as the 35-minute power cut set in. Officials maintained a grip on their emotions despite the fact there appeared to be little clue as to what was going on.

Lights out! As the interview wrapped up at the control room in the New Orleans stadium, the moment power went out was caught live on camera

Sportscaster Armen Keteyian was conducting an interview with top Superdome official Frank Supovitz for CBS shortly after Beyoncé's half-time show during the game between the San Francisco 49ers and Baltimore Ravens.

The pair were discussing how the superstar's performance had over-run by three minutes and were wrapping up the interview when floodlights around the top of the Superdome cut out, plunging thousands of fans and players on the field into darkness. 

At first, Supovitz calmly announced 'Alright, we lost lights' before another official says 'we're going to a manual override'.

The mood became tense as officials struggled to get an idea of what had happened. Doug Thornton, a senior official for SMG who own the Superdome, then told Supovitz: 'Frank, we lost the A feed.'

Supovitz replied: 'What does that mean?'

Thornton added: 'That means that we have to do the bus time?' before Supovitz again asked: 'What does that mean?'

Only then does Thornton explain there will be a likely 20-minute delay.

Uh-oh: Questions remain as to why the lights blew at the Super Bowl 2013 with officials simply saying it was down to an 'abnormality' in the power system

Questions remain over exactly what 
caused the stadium to plunge into darkness in the third 
quarter of the game, with officials simply saying that it was due to an 
'abnormality' in the power system.

Beyoncé was let off the hook on Monday after she was earlier made scapegoat when she allegedly blew the electrics twice during rehearsals for her spectacular half-time performance.

The problem occurred shortly after the superstar's show, leaving many wondering whether extravagant lighting and video effects were to blame, while others questioned whether New Orleans' infrastructure was still suffering in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.

Public records released on Monday 
show that Superdome officials were worried about a power outage several 
months before the big game.

An
October 15 memo released by the Louisiana Stadium & Exposition 
District, which oversees the Superdome, says tests on the dome's 
electrical feeders showed they had 'some decay and a chance of failure'.

Entergy New Orleans, the company that
supplies the stadium with power, and the structure's engineering staff 
'had concerns regarding the reliability of the Dome service from 
Entergy's connection point to the Dome,' the memo says.

Those
concerns were due in part to 'circumstances that have previously 
occurred with the electrical service regarding transient spikes and 
loads'.

The memo also cites 2011 blackouts 
that struck Candlestick Park, where the San Francisco 49ers were playing
a nationally televised on Monday night football game, as a reason for 
ordering the tests.

The 
board later authorized spending nearly $1 million on Superdome 
improvements, including more than $600,000 for upgrading the dome's 
electrical feeder cable system.

'As discussed in previous board 
meetings, this enhancement is necessary to maintain both the Superdome 
and the New Orleans Arena as top tier facilities, and to ensure that we 
do not experience any electrical issues during the Super Bowl,' says a 
LSED document dated December 19.

An attorney for the state board that 
oversees the Superdome said the blackout did not appear to be related to
the replacement in December of electrical equipment connecting the 
stadium to Entergy. Officials with the utility and the Superdome noted 
that an NFL game, the Sugar Bowl and another bowl game were played there
in recent weeks with no apparent problems.

The exact cause of Sunday night's 
blackout - and who's to blame - remained unclear late on Monday, though a
couple of potential culprits had been ruled out.

It wasn't Beyonce's electrifying 
halftime performance, according to Doug Thornton, manager of the 
state-owned Superdome, since the singer had her own generator.

And it apparently wasn't a case of 
too much demand for power. Meters showed the 76,000-seat stadium was 
drawing no more electricity than it does during a typical New Orleans 
Saints game, Thornton said.

The
lights-out game on Sunday proved an embarrassment for New Orleans just 
when it was hoping to show the rest of the world how far it has come 
since Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

But many fans and residents were 
forgiving, and officials expressed confidence that the episode wouldn't 
hurt the city's hopes of hosting the championship again.

To New Orleans' great relief, NFL 
Commissioner Roger Goodell said the city did a 'terrific' job hosting 
its first pro-football championship in the post-Hurricane Katrina era, 
and added: 'I fully expect that we will be back here for Super Bowls.'

Fans watching from their living rooms
weren't deterred, either. An estimated 108.4 million television viewers
saw the Baltimore Ravens beat the San Francisco 49ers 34-31, making it 
the third most-viewed program in television history. Both the 2010 and 
2011 games hit the 111 million mark.

The problem that caused the outage 
was believed to have happened around the spot where a line that feeds 
current from Entergy New Orleans connects with the Superdome's 
electrical system, officials said. But whether the fault lay with the 
utility or with the Superdome was not clear.

Determining the cause will probably 
take days, according to Dennis Dawsey, a vice president for distribution
and transmission for Entergy. He said the makers of some of the 
switching gear have been brought in to help figure out what happened.

The blackout came after a nearly flawless week of activity for football fans in New Orleans leading up to the big game.

'I hope that's not what they'll remember about this Super Bowl,' French Quarter artist Gloria Wallis said. 'I hope that what they'll remember is they had a great time here and that they were welcomed here.'

Ravens fan Antonio Prezioso, a Baltimore native who went to the game with his 11-year-old son, said the outage just extended the experience.

'The more time we could spend at the game was a good thing, as long as it ended the way it did,' he said, laughing.

The city last hosted the Super Bowl in 2002, and officials were hoping this would serve as the ultimate showcase for the city's recovery since Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The storm tore holes in the roof of the Superdome and caused water damage to its electrical systems, and more than $330 million was spent repairing and upgrading the stadium.

Sunday's Super Bowl was New Orleans' 10th as host, and officials plan to make a bid for an 11th in 2018.

Mayor Mitch Landrieu told WWL-AM on Monday that the outage won't hurt the city's chances, and he joked that the game got better after the blackout: 'People were leaving and the game was getting boring, so we had to do a little something to spice it up.'

The chairwoman of the New Orleans City Council's Utility Committee has called an emergency meeting for Friday to discuss the power outage.

Jarvis DeBerry, a columnist for nola.com and The Times-Picayune, wrote that the power outage gave the media 'an opportunity to laugh at the apparent ineptitude or suggest that the ghosts of Hurricane Katrina were haunting the Superdome'.

'That's not the kind of attention the city was looking for, obviously,' he wrote, 'but it's certainly too soon to say if people will remember the power shortage over San Francisco's furious comeback attempt against Baltimore or if this will harm the city's future opportunities to host the Super Bowl'.
