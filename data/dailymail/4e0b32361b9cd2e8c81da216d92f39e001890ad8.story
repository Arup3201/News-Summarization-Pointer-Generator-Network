One-year-old Benjamin Williams does not look forward to a bottle of milk before bed, he can't even have a cuddle with his doting parents before drifting off to sleep.

The toddler has to avoid drinking water, is not allowed to eat chocolate and is unable to have important childhood injections and medication.

Benjamin is so allergic to the world around him, he can only eat five foods and the list of things to avoid is ever growing.

He can eat so few foods his first birthday cake was a melon with a single candle sticking out of it.

One-year-old Benjamine Williams is allergic to the world around him, he cannot drink milk or water, he is not allowed to eat a raft of different foods and even cuddling his parents Kileigh and Glyn can cause his sensitive skin to come out in painful hives

For his first birthday, Benjamin had to enjoy a melon with a candle sticking in the top. His mother Kileigh has gradually, through trial and error, compiled a list of around 40 things her son is allergic to

His parents Kileigh, 27, and Glyn, 37, have compiled the long list of things that cause their son to suffer a dangerous allergic reaction if he so much as touches them.

So far it includes bottled water, chocolate, dairy products and corn, but the couple say they are discovering new allergies all the time.

Their outgoing son is also allergic to ointments and childhood injections.

And his skin is so sensitive, simply cuddling his mother and father can bring him out in painful hives.

Doctors feared the toddler, from Newton Abbot in Devon, could be suffering from cerebral palsy and warned his parents he may never walk or talk.

But as his symptoms eased they diagnosed him with the stomach complaint reflux, unaware the true cause of Benjamin's sickness and diarrohea was actually a crippling array of allergies.

Over the next few months Mrs Williams started to worry her breast milk could be triggering the condition and, sure enough, her son's condition improved when she switched to a powdered formula.

Through a process of trial and error the mother-of-two identified a long list of everyday foods that were making Benjamin ill, and eventually found just five 'safe' foods - chicken, potatoes, carrots, banana and melon.

Benjamin, 
now aged 20 months, takes steroids and medicines to control his many 
allergies, which include Food Protein-Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome 
(FPIES) - a condition whereby the body reacts violently to certain types
 of protein.

But
 charity worker Mrs Williams still faces a daily battle to keep her 
'inquisitive, amazing' little boy away from the dozens of substances 
that pose a threat to his health.

Mrs Williams said: 'You just want to pick him up and give him a cuddle but on his bad days I can't even do that because the slightest touch or knock can bring him out in hives'

She said: 'There are just so many things that could harm him - at least 40 so far - but there could be more we don’t know about.

'Broccoli, corn, potato starch, soya, dairy products, cucumber, tomatoes, anaesthetic cream, satsumas - the list is endless.

'The other day I ironed his clothes with scented oil and that brought him out in a rash. It just didn’t occur to me that something as simple as that could trigger an allergic reaction.

'When we went to Portugal for a holiday we tested to see if he was allergic to bottled water - and sure enough he was.

'You just want to pick him up and give him a cuddle but on his bad days I can't even do that because the slightest touch or knock can bring him out in hives'

- Kileigh, Benjamin's mother

'As a mum you have to be constantly on guard. There have been times that I couldn’t sleep because I wanted to watch over him constantly.

'You just want to pick him up and give him a cuddle but on his bad days I can’t even do that because the slightest touch or knock can bring him out in hives.

'You see other children approaching him with chocolate on their fingers and you know it could hurt him.

'His life has been one big battle so far.'

Because
 Benjamin’s condition is so unusual Mr and Mrs Williams, have arranged 
for him to see leading allergy specialists at the private Portland 
Hospital in London.

They
 needed £1,000 just for the consultation but after the family put an 
appeal over Facebook friends came forward with the cash almost 
overnight.

They now hope to learn how more FPIES, in particular, which causes inflammation of the small and large intestine, leading to violent diarrhoea and vomiting.

It differs from normal allergies because the reaction is normally delayed for several hours and there no warnings signs like a rash or swelling.

The most common triggers are dairy products and soy however almost any food can cause an FPIES reaction, including rice, oats, certain vegetables and meats such as chicken and turkey.

Mrs Williams, whose other son Jack, six, has asthma but is otherwise completely healthy, said: 'Benjamin has been taken to hospital several times when he’s been very unwell.

'But the one person who never complains in Benjamin himself. He’s amazing.

'For his first birthday his cake was a piece of melon with a candle in it but he loved it all the same because he doesn’t know anything different.

'He’s inquisitive, sociable, he just loves life. It’s getting harder as he gets older because he sees what his brother is eating and gets frustrated that he can’t try it himself.

'But he’s never let it get him down, he never moans or whinges. We just need to keep him safe and help get him get the treatment he needs.'
