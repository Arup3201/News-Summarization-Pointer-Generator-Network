A New York woman is planning to file a lawsuit against a Queens restaurant after finding a huge bug in her bowl of soup.

Natalie Estrella ordered a bowl of sancocho from Nuevo Mundo restaurant in Far Rockaway and was halfway through it when she noticed a many-legged morsel floating in the broth.

Estrella says that when she showed the bug, which she believes was a silverfish, to the restaurant manager he told her, 'It's nothing,' and threw it away.

Unpleasant discovery: Natalie Estrella fished this bug out of the soup she was eating for lunch at a Queens restaurant

Bad reaction: Estrella says she became physically ill after eating the soup and had to go to hospital to treatment

She was given a refund for the price of the soup.

Estrella says she became so ill after eating the soup that she had to go to hospital for food poisoning.

'I felt dizzy, my stomach started hurting and then I threw up.'

It was, she says, 'the worst day of my life.'

Estrella was treated at St John's Episcopal Hospital for 'insect ingestion,' according to discharge papers.

Nuevo Mundo: The restaurant is located on Mott St in Queens

Hospital visit: Estrella went to hospital after eating the soup which she says the restaurant was still serving when she left

The manager at Nuevo Mundo, who identified himself to Pix 11 only as Carlos, said the insect couldn't have come from his restaurant.

'It's impossible for a big like that to be in the restaurant,' he said. 'That's a house bug.'

'My food is top of the line. I have nothing to hide,' he said, allowing Pix 11 cameras into the serving area.

Nuevo Mundo has a pending 'C' grade from the Department of Health and 44 violation points for violations including 'Evidence of mice or live mice present in facility's food and/or non-food areas,' 'Filth flies or food/refuse/sewage-associated (FRSA) flies present in facilityâ€™s food and/or non-food areas,' and 'facility not vermin proof. Harborage or conditions conducive to attracting vermin to the premises and/or allowing vermin to exist.'

'C' grade from the Department of Health for flies and other violations

Silverfish are a common household insect. They feed on polysaccharides and starch, eating things like glue, book bindings, glossy paper, hair, dandruff, shampoos and other insects.

Their ideal habitat is a dark damp area and they're often found in kitchens and bathrooms.

Estrella says she's taking action because the restaurant continued serving the soup to other customers after she left.

'People, please don't eat there for your safety. They just want your money they don't care about your health,' she said.

'It just angers me that they thought it was all right.'
