We've been waiting more than two decades for the iconic hoverboard from Back To The Future II to become a reality, and finally it's arrived - perfectly on cue.

It's the year 2015 when Marty McFly and Doc are awestruck by the amazing futuristic skateboard in the  film classic - but what they couldn't have predicted in 1989 is that the hoverboard would be so much more than offer a nifty (yet rather dangerous) way to zip around town.

It would also hold the secret to having a core of steel - and, officially called the Drift, be one of 2015's hottest new fitness gadgets.

The future has arrived! It was 2015 when the Marty and Doc discovered the iconic hoverboard in Back To The Future II and now it's real-life incarnation has arrived in the form of the Drift (right)

The clever device was dreamed up by Quirky, a brand that specialise in new inventions. After hearing people complain about their achy calves after snow boarding, they realised the key to minimising pain was improving balance.

Unfortunately the gadget isn't quite as futuristic as Marty McFly's and a peek underneath  reveals an adjustable ball-and-pendulum balancing mechanism.

According to the brand's spokesman: 'This allows for a unique range of motion while its moving roller-arm lets the rider rock, roll and pivot.'

Drift simulates a variety of action sports which they say helps strengthen the core, improve balance, burn calories, and increase lower body strength.

Those clever people at Quirky say 30 minutes on the board is equivalent to an hour snowboarding or surfing.

The drift, which retails here at £149.99, has already been in a hit in America and has just started hitting gyms in the the UK.

According to personal trainer Andrew Flint, the device could improve both balance and core stability: 'I would say both those are key aspects of health and fitness.

'Core stability is important in all sport - except perhaps darts.

'We use the hips as the main driver for most sports and this would directly tie into the driver of your hips. It could also help with coordination. 

'In terms of burning calories, there are more effective ways of going about it. Your traditional treadmill or high-intensity interval training, for example, both have higher calorie burning ability.

'Core work will improve strength but won't give you a superficial six pack. Having good core stability is not usually hugely visible but will enable you to be fitter.' 

Andy advises  integrating the device into a fitness programme. 'It could be a good add-on to a regime, but not a stand alone workout,' he says.

'Unfortunately that ten minute workout that does everything hasn’t yet been developed - and probably never will.'

Here's hoping there are some budding Docs out there who will prove the experts wrong.
