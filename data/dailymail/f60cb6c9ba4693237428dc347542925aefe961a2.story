A love-struck Irishman who sought the help of social media users from around the globe to identify a mystery woman he met on a flight is set to be reunited with her.

Jamie Kelly's friends launched the #loveatfirstflight campaign on Twitter after he made a connection with an attractive Canadian woman named Katie as they sat together on a flight from Barcelona to Dublin last week.

The Ryanair Romeo and Katie hit it off but they got separated when they went through customs and were unable to find each other on the other side.

Desperately seeking ... Jamie Kelly launched an internet appeal to find Katie - who he met on a budget flight

With only Katie's first name to go on, the smitten 24-year-old from Galway turned to social media for help and made an appeal on a national radio programme to locate her.

It turns out the woman – 27-year-old Katie Moreau from Riverport, Nova Scotia – had been looking for him at the airport, too. 

Kelly told TodayFM's Ray D'Arcy: 'We talked from the plane into the terminal together and stayed talking until we reached the passport control.'

He said: 'She went to follow me through the EU only lane but I pointed her towards the non-EU residents' line.'

Kelly waited outside passport control for about 10 minutes but Katie didn't emerge.

He told TodayFM: 'See, I was so engrossed during the flight and being the gentleman that I am I didn't want to go to the toilet in front of this beautiful girl so I used the time I had at the passport control to nip to the loo.'

The online campaign eventually spread across the ocean to Canada, where one of Moreau's relatives saw the story and reached out to one of Kelly's friends to put the potential romance back in play.

Moreau told CBC News she was 'surprised and flattered' when she learned the 'handsome Irishman' had launched an online campaign to find her. 

Jamie Kelly and Katie Moreau became separated when they arrived at passport control 

She said: 'When I was on the plane I talked to him incessantly because I had just been travelling for two months in Italy and Spain and it was just so nice to be around English speaking people, plus I'm a talker.

'We had lots in common plus he was very easy on the eyes.'

Her family and friends have been inundating her with messages after they caught wind of the campaign.

She said: 'I find it very humorous because all my friends back home are losing their heads over it.'

Kelly and Moreau have been chatting online and made plans to meet in person.
