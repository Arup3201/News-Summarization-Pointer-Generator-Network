The teenagers’ disappearance came soon after private school pupils Indira Gainiyeva, 17, and Edward Bunyan, 16, ran away from their £30,000-a-year boarding school to the Dominican Republic.

The teenage lovers used credit cards to flee to the Caribbean island and spent two weeks there in hiding before being found by local police and brought back to the UK by their parents.
