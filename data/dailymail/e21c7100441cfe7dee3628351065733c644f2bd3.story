As well as a 5,000 seat stadium and 30,000 sq ft mall, a soon-to-be built monster entertainment resort  in Macau  will have one other star attraction.

Developers behind Studio City, designed to replicate Batman's Gotham City, have unveiled plans for a Ferris wheel  built into the building's towering facade.

The landmark ride - called the Golden Eye -  will be Asia's highest Ferris wheel at 130 metres and was inspired by 'two asteroids shooting through a Gotham City building'.

Based around famous hit film themed attractions, Studio City will also house a virtual reality Batman ride and Wonder Woman go-karts.

The  £1.2 billion ($2.1 billion) hotel will have 1,600 rooms, each designed in Art Deco style, a 5,000-seat multi-purpose entertainment center for  live concerts, theatrical and top sporting events and its own TV studio.

The building will have an in-built Ferris Wheel at the centre of the construction that gives guests views of either side of the hotel

Developers have unveiled plans for the £1.2 billion entertainment resort in Macau which will be built this year

Studio 8, a fully-operational TV broadcast studio, will be a 300-seat live-audience arena for reality and game-show productions for Asia. 

As well as a long list of starry attractions and themed restaurants and food halls, a Pacha nightclub will take up residence in Studio City. The Pacha brand already has clubs in Ibiza, New York, Dubai, Buenos Aires and Sydney.

Golden Eye is due to be completed later this year.
