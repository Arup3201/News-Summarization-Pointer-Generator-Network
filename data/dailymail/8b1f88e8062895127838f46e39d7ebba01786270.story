Heather Mack, 19, appeared emotional as she cradled her growing baby bump ahead of the start of her trial

A heavily-pregnant American teenage has told how she misses her mother, as  the suitcase the socialite's body was found stuffed inside was pictured for the first time.

Heather Mack, who is seven months' pregnant, and her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, 21, are accused of killing Sheila von Wiese-Mack and then stuffing her body inside the piece of luggage.

The strain showed on the 19-year-old's face as she followed the opening of her trial on the resort island of Bali through an Indonesian interpreter.

The grey-coloured suitcase and some blood-stained sheets were presented as evidence on the opening day of the case.

Ahead of the hearing Mack revealed that she misses her socialite mother  'everyday' and loved her 'with all my heart.' 

Mack said she was petrified ahead of her trial, but that her fears were ‘more for my daughter than me,’ according to the Chicago Tribune.

If the young lovers are found guilty they will face a firing squad. 

'I loved my mom with all my heart and miss her every day,’ the newspaper reported Mack as saying.

She reportedly added that ‘If I allow myself to grieve whatsoever I’m in a complete state of depression.

‘The smile (seen in photos of her arriving at court) is actually a disguise I wear to survive here.’

But she said she was receiving help from ‘good Samaritans who helped to get her food and vitamins and her baby, Stella, named after Schaefer’s great-grandmother, was healthy.

Referring to the baby, she told the paper: ‘She’s healthy and it is completely safe here and (a) completely fair country.’ 

Mack revealed that she believes her lawyer would prove her innocence and asked ‘that the public reserve judgment on my case until the judges passes his verdict.’

Earlier this week three judges rejected a last-ditch attempt by the Chicago couple's defence teams to have the case thrown out.

They had  claimed that there were 'inaccuracies' on the indictment and it should be annulled at the hearing in Denpasar.

Witnesses are now due to start giving evidence in the case against Mack.

Schaefer will be tried separately with the same judges and prosecuting teams at the Denpasar District Court.

Dressed in matching  white shirts and orange prison waistcoats, Mack and Schaefer were handcuffed to each other as they arrived at the District Court.

Miss Mack's bulging baby bump was clearly visible. 

The pair were sent to the island's notorious Kerobokan Prison in December ahead of their trials.

They were arrested in August following the gruesome discovery of the badly beaten body of Mack's 62-year-old mother stuffed inside a suitcase that had been loaded into a taxi outside the luxury St Regis Hotel in Nusa Dua.

They were charged with premeditated murder, which carries the death penalty. 

Prosecutors have alleged that the couple sent text messages about their initial plan to disguise a murder as suicide on the beach. 

In their indictment, prosecutors alleged that the couple plotted the murder because von Wiese-Mack did not approve of their relationship and that Mack had once suggested that Schaefer hire someone to kill her mother for $50,000.

They further alleged that an argument over the hotel bill made Mack's mother angry and she scolded Schaefer, using a racial slur, and Schaefer then battered her with a fruit bowl handle.

Mack, who is seven months' pregnant, helped stuff her mother's body in the suitcase by sitting on it to enable Schaefer to close it, according to the indictment. 

They then hired a taxi and placed the suitcase in the trunk and told the driver they were going to check out of the hotel and would return, but never did, it was alleged.

US judge, Neil Cohen, sitting in the Cook County Court, said Miss Mack should be allowed to have a total of $150,000 from a trust fund set up by her murdered mother to pay for her defence.

But Miss Mack told the Chicago Tribune that despite the judge’s order, her defence attorney, Mr Aly Soendardi, had received only a first payment of $50,000.

The judge had, in fact, ordered that only $50,000 should be made as a down-payment until Miss Mack’s lawyer provided billing statements explaining the work being done.

However, Miss Mack has accused three US attorneys for the hold-up in the remainder of the money and said she was now planning to have them fired from the American side of her fight against the premeditated murder charge which carries a maximum sentence of death.

Behind bars: Mack and Schaefer, pictured earlier this week, face a maximum penalty of death by firing squad if found guilty.
