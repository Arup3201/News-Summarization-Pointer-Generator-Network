Opinion aims to kick start a glorious international campaign for owners Highclere Thoroughbreds when he lines up in Saturday’s Moonee Valley Cup in Australia.

Victory for the colt, who won the 2013 Duke Of Edinburgh Handicap at Royal Ascot when trained by Sir Michael Stoute, will guarantee a start in the biggest race Down Under on November 4, two days after Highclere’s Stoute-trained Hardwicke Stakes winner and King George runner-up Telescope contests the Breeders’ Cup Turf at Santa Anita in California.

Opinion has had 10 starts since being transferred to the stable of Chris Waller, finishing second in the Metropolitan Handicap at Randwick on his latest run.

Highclere’s Stoute-trained Distinction carried their blue silks twice in the race, finishing second in 2004.

Highclere’s Harry Herbert said: ‘Opinion is edging ever closer to the Melbourne Cup. He is 85 per cent certain to get in the race but if he was to win on Saturday, he’d be nailed on.

‘He is really good form and was a shade unlucky when putting in a good run last time out.’

While Opinion is 40-1 for the Melbourne Cup, Telescope, last seen when third to Australia in the International Stakes at York in August, disputes favouritism at 4-1 for the Breeders’ Cup Turf.

Temptations to run the colt part-owned by Sir Alex Ferguson in the Prix de L’ Arc de Triomphe were resisted.

Herbert added: ‘Sir Michael said we would by-pass the Arc. He has had a good break, goes of the fast ground and has good tactical speed. We hope he has luck in running because he has a good chance of being competitive.’

A difficult summer for Highclere has been ameliorated by some good two-year-old performances, notably from Richard Hannon-trained Flying Childers Stakes winner Beacon and impressive Stoute-trained maiden winner Consort, who figures in the betting for the 2015 Investec Derby.

Actor Hugh Bonneville, only a short distance from where he plays the Earl of Grantham when Highclere Castle doubles as Downton Abbey, was among members attending Monday's parade of latest yearling recruit at Highclere Stud.

Bonneville has a share in a 160,000gn Dark Angel colt going to Hannon and a 65,000gn Raven’s Pass colt heading to Stoute.

Another new Highclere recruit is David Simcock. The Newmarket trainer, who intends running Sunday’s Canadian Group Three winner Caspar Netscher in the Turf Sprint at the Breeders’ Cup, has been sent a colt by Lawman.

JUMPS trainer Dan Skelton, who has doubled his string to 70 horses and is already closing to matching the first-season tally with 24 wins already on the board, has revealed Willow’s Saviour, winner of last season’s Ladbrokes Hurdle is injured and out for the season.
