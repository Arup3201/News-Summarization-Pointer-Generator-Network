A wandering cat is set to be reunited with his owner in London a year after he went missing - after being discovered 450 miles away from home, in a Scottish bank.

Nine-year-old silver tabby Pablo disappeared from Brockley, south London, last October, with distraught owner Siobhan Campbell giving him up for dead

But last week the cat strolled into a branch of TSB bank in Rosyth, Fife, after learning how to activate the automatic door.

Miles: Nine-year-old silver tabby Pablo disappeared from Brockley, south London, last October and was found in Rosyth, Fife

Shocked staff only noticed their new guest after he settled down for a nap on an armchair.

Workers handed him in to the Cats Protection charity, and when he was checked for a microchip it revealed he was 449 miles from home.

His owner’s mother Kate Partridge said she could not believe her ears when she took the call - though she admitted that Pablo - nicknamed Six Dinner Sid after a children's book - has always been a 'character'.

Before he made his road trip, Pablo was well known in Brockley, where dogs crossed the street to avoid him and he would force motorists to drive round him by sitting in the road.

Just like the children’s book character Six Dinner Sid, he also had several houses he visited to be fed.

He was known by different names including Betty and Fluffy, and he had his own chair in the home of an elderly neighbour.

Office manager Ms Partridge, 59, said: 'None of us can believe it. I can’t get over it.

'Pablo has always been a Six Dinner Sid, but he has surpassed Sid this time.

'I was just thinking on Thursday that it must be a year since he was last seen. On Friday afternoon I had a call from a vet in Rosyth saying he had just been handed in.

'How on earth had he got over 400 miles from Lewisham and where has he been for the last year?'

Staff at Cats Protection are now planning to arrange for Pablo to be flown back to London to be reunited with Kate and daughter Siobhan.

Pablo joined the family eight years ago, when he used to go to their home and be fed before disappearing again.

Eventually Ms Campbell, 33, an art teacher and mother-of-two, decided to give him a permanent home and had him neutered and microchipped, but he did not curb his wandering ways.

The nine-year-old silver tabby turned up in Rosyth this week, more than 400 miles and a year after he went missing from his home in London

She added: 'He was always a character and a Six Dinner Sid, for those who know the children’s story.

'He used to sit in the middle of her road and cars would go round him, he hated dogs so they would cross the road to avoid him and he had several names - Fluffy, Betty and apparently someone thought Betty was pregnant.

'He also used to hang around the old people’s home in her street and had his own chair in the home of an elderly neighbour.'

Pablo’s disappearances became more frequent after Ms Campbell’s son Caolan was born three years ago, and last October he vanished altogether.

The family searched all his usual haunts before giving up, convinced he was dead.

Luckily Doreen King, who works at the Vetrica surgery in Rosyth, had been asked to give Pablo the once-over and check him for a microchip after he had been handed to Cats Protection.

The tabby had learned how to operate the door of the nearby TSB bank, and had been going inside to sleep on the chairs left out for customers.

She said: 'He had been staying in the bank, as he had learned how to open the doors and was going in and lying on the chairs.

'They brought him in and I scanned him. At first when I saw the phone number and address I thought maybe they had moved up but when I got in contact with the owners they were still in London.

'They thought he was dead. They had not seen him for a year.

'She was absolutely in shock. I phoned and said do you have a silver tabby called Pablo, and I told her that we had got him.

'She asked where we were, and I heard her shouting her husband and saying "They’ve found Pablo and he’s in Scotland".

'He must have jumped in a van or a lorry.

'He was in pretty good condition. I think somebody had been looking after him. He is really nice and friendly.'

Staff at Cats Protection are now trying to arrange to fly Pablo back home, but they still have no idea how he made it all the way to Fife.

The most likely theory is that he hopped into a lorry or removal van which was travelling north.

But the most pressing problem now facing Pablo’s owners is how to keep tabs on him once he is back in his old neighbourhood.

Ms Partridge added: 'If Siobhan was driving home and saw him up the road she would stop the car and he would jump in. He must have done something like that.

'We’re absolutely overjoyed to be getting him back, but it’s going to be hard keeping him in.

'There is another Six Dinner Sid book about Six Dinner Sid going to the Highlands. I think Pablo must have read them.'
