The mother of the then 7-year-old boy molested by the fugitive killed in a daytime Manhattan shootout Monday has spoken out to convey her relief.

'I'm relieved the threat is gone,' the unnamed San Diego mother told the new York Daily News on Tuesday, just a day after NYPD detectives and U.S. Marshals cornered pedophile Charles Mozdir, who was killed as part of the ensuing Greenwich Village showdown.

One of those detectives has emerged as a hero of the day after managing to survive being hit by three bullets as he helped bring Mozdir to justice.

Cops: Heavily armed police investigate the shooting, which left Charles Mozdir dead and one of the officers shot three times. That officer, Mario Muniz, was celebrated Tuesday by both his mother and the relieved mother of the then 7-year-old boy Mozdir molested

Discovered: Sex offender Charles Mozdir, 33, had been on the run for two years prior to being shot dead following a dramatic shoot-out in New York City on Monday afternoon. He's apparently been hiding in plain sight

Mario Muniz is that detective. The 45-year-old has 20 years of service with the NYPD under his belt and had recently been given a promotion.

And as Muniz recovered Tuesday, his proud mother spoke out about her hero son.

'Everyone told me he is one of the best. He is a first-grade detective,' Carmen Muniz told The New York Post. 'He is a hero but I don’t want him to be a hero. I want him to be alive.'

Nonetheless, Mrs. Muniz, who lives in Queens with her son and family, remains proud.

'I just want him to come home. I’m going to put up a sign saying "Welcome Home,"' she said. 'I am going to cook him whatever he wants.'

No doubt, the California mother is also counting her blessings, Muniz maybe chief among them. She says she's

'I want to send my deepest appreciation to the officers,' she said. 'My family and I are so comforted that we don't have this threat hanging over us anymore.'

The mother explained that she knew the 33-year-old before he molested her son and then fled California for New York.

'He was a wolf in sheep's clothing,' she said of Mozdir, who was found hiding in plain site as he worked at a Manhattan smoke shop. 'He was the type of person who thought he was smarter than everyone else. So that's exactly how I think he would try to hide. Blend in and disguise himself.'

When the Daily News told the mother that Mozdir was living under the name John Smith, she was appalled.

'That's creepy,' said the mom, who's husband is named John. 'I don't know if he did it because of my husband, but he always had a little bit of an obsession with my husband.'

Injured: Two U.S. Marshals and an NYPD detective were wounded in the shooting which erupted at around 1pm Monday in New York City's West Village

The shootout Monday between Mozdir and members of the New York/New Jersey Regional Fugitive Task Force happened just after 1 p.m. in Greenwich Village not far from New York University in a highly trafficked tourist area bounded by jazz clubs, restaurants, a subway station and a basketball court.

Mozdir's handgun was recovered at the scene, and 20 extra rounds of ammunition were found in his pocket, Police Commissioner William Bratton said.

A police detective first entered the narrow smoke shop and identified Mozdir, who apparently was alone, Police Commissioner Bratton said, before leaving and returning with the U.S. marshals.

The detective was shot at least twice, in the stomach below his protective vest and in the right chest, which could have been deadly were it not stopped by the vest, Bratton said at a hospital.

One U.S. marshal was shot in the elbow and another in his buttocks, he said. All three were in stable condition and had been visited by city and federal officials.

Saved by the vest: NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton and Mayor Bill De Blasio hold up the police detective's bullet-proof vest on Monday to show where he was shot. They said the item likely saved his life

Mayor Bill de Blasio said the three officers are stable and that, 'We pray everything we are hearing is true and that these officers will be OK in the long run'

The detective didn't fire his weapon, but the federal agents fired multiple rounds, authorities said.

'They do what law enforcement personnel do every day,' Mayor Bill de Blasio said. 'They have to put their lives on the line to protect the rest of us.'

A $1 million bench warrant was issued for Mozdir's arrest in June 2012 after he skipped an arraignment in San Diego Superior Court on child sexual assault charges, a spokesman for the San Diego County district attorney said.

Mozdir, a wedding photographer, also had been charged with attempting to dissuade a witness from prosecution, the criminal complaint said. He had posted $250,000 bail.

Mozdir's 
case had recently been featured on CNN's 'The Hunt with John Walsh.' 
Mozdir was accused of abusing the boy while babysitting him, and 
authorities later found evidence of child pornography and bestiality on 
his cellphone and computers, according to the show's website, quoting 
federal authorities.

Authorities had searched for him in Coronado, Georgia, California and Mexico, the show said.

The
 San Diego County public defender's office, which represented Mozdir in 
the child molestation case, didn't immediately return a message seeking 
comment Monday.
