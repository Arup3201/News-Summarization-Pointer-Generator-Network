The number of children who are thought to be at risk from neglect or abuse has risen over the last three years as experts say the recession has lead to youngsters being badly treated.

Up to one in twenty children in some parts of England are being monitored by social services, new figures have revealed.

Ray Jones, Professor of Social Work at the University of Kingston, told Sky News: 'I think we are aware of the dangers more than we were before and I think we are more determined to act on them.'

Case: Social workers are reacting to the case of Peter Connelly who died with more than 50 injuries despite being on the at risk register. Statistics show English councils started 127,060 investigations last year

The Times reports social workers are reacting to the case of Peter Connelly who died with more than 50 injuries despite being on the at risk register.

Statistics show English councils started 127,060 investigations into children thought to be at risk in 2012-13. This is a 42.3 per cent increase since 2009-10.

In some parts of England the figures are higher. Blackpool has 4.5 per cent of children being investigated, 2.6 per cent in Doncaster and 2.1 per cent in Peterborough.

The NSPCC says the most common reason that social workers become involved is neglect.

Children's charity Action for Children did a survey in 2012-13 which showed the most common reason for the rise in cases was a lack of parenting skills.

People working with children say the other reason was poverty, which has risen from 44 per cent in 2009 to 66 per cent in 2012.
