A multi-millionaire bachelor has revealed he has spent more than $65,000 on matchmaking services and still can't find his ideal wife.

Former Wall Street trader Larry Greenfield, from Long Island, New York, has used six different agencies over the last 12 years in his quest to meet the perfect woman.

He's been on dates with 250 women but, so far, without success.

Now the unlucky in love 47-year-old is claiming the expensive dating services are a 'rip-off'.

Larry Greenfield has been looking for a bride for the last 12 years by using six different dating services with no luck

But the matchmakers claim Mr Greenfield wants women who are simply out of his league.

Mr Greenfield, who retired after a successful career at Opus Trading in Jericho, Long Island, says he would gladly trade his riches in exchange for finding love.

But the lucky woman needs to meet his exacting standards. She must be beautiful, thin, smart, Jewish, have a sense of humor and be from New York.

Speaking to the New York Post, Mr Greenfield said: 'New York is a tough market for a guy like me. I thought I get the career, then I find the woman.

'I'd trade it all in for a white picket fence, two kids, a dog. And you can have it all! I'd take a $50,000-a-year job, work until I retire.'

'I'm not a bad guy. I haven't been to prison,' he said. 'It's just a very frustrating thing.'

Serious Matchmaking's Janis Spindel (website pictured) said she's reluctant to take Mr Greenfield on as a client because she's worried that his dream girl isn't in her database

Speaking about the matchmakers, Mr Greenfield said: 'You pay them up front and they don't provide a service. They tell you how wonderful you are, whatever you want to hear.'

The matchmakers said Mr Greenfield needs to lower his expectations — and not rely only on his money to find love.

'In the outside world, he would not be able to get a date with that girl, because she was far more attractive,' blasted Long Island matchmaker Maureen Tara Nelson, who dropped Mr Greenfield as a client after one year.

'He was too picky! I gave him exactly what he wanted multiple times ... He would always come back with some minor, minor thing that the person wasn't perfect.'

Serious Matchmaking's Janis Spindel said she's reluctant to take Mr Greenfield on as a client because she's worried that his dream girl isn't in her database.

'I don't want to take his money,' she said.

'The target audience of what he needs is a teacher from the boroughs or a secretary. Larry can't be with an alpha female who runs a hedge fund... He's a country bumpkin.'

The former securities trader lives in rural Plainview, Long Island, and says he doesn't want to date a woman who is obsessed with her career.

'I'm battling successful alphas, driven women who are very comfortable in their lives, and I get left in the dust,' Mr Greenfield said.

'My job right now is meeting a girl.'
