Republican Senators Rand Paul and Marco Rubio's row over the resuscitation of relations with Cuba has continued to escalate, with the Florida lawmaker now calling Paul the 'chief cheerleader of Obama's foreign policy' and the Kentucky legislator accusing his colleague of funding the Muslim Brotherhood.

Paul's latest attack on Rubio, a possible opponent in the GOP's 2016 presidential primary, relates to ongoing monetary aid to Egypt, where the Muslim Brotherhood once held sway over the government but was banned from participating in politics earlier this year due to its terrorist ties.

In a tweet trolling Rubio, the libertarian lawmaker said he 'forgot to mention his support for Obama's funding of Musl. Brotherhood, arming Islamic rebels, and Hillary's war in Libya.'

Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio are feuding over President Barack Obama's announcement last week that the U.S. had resumed high-level diplomatic relations with Cuba. The two potential 2016 rivals have been taking public digs at each other for days now - but they swear its not related to the presidential election

After Rubio called Paul the 'chief cheerleader of Obama's foreign policy,' the Kentucky Sen. directed this tweet at him, accusing him of indirectly funding the Muslim Brotherhood by supporting ongoing aid to Egypt

Freshman Sen. Paul notably opposed legislation this fall to train and equip moderate Syrian rebels to fight ISIS in a ground war. The war-weary lawmaker was also a vocal opponent of the Obama administration's use of airstrikes - without the approval of Congress - during a 2011 military intervention in Libya.

Rubio voted in favor of a resolution backed by the Obama administration to fund the Syrian opposition movement and urged Congress in 2011 to give Obama the authority to bomb former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi and his regime.

Paul's hard-hitting tweet to Rubio was the latest jab thrown in a feud between the frenemies that began last week after President Barack Obama suddenly announced that the U.S. and Cuba were back on speaking terms after a 53-year embargo on the country.

The Kentucky senator said that lifting the unilateral embargo was 'probably a good idea' because it 'doesn’t seem to be working.'

'Probably, it punishes the people more than the regime because the regime can blame the embargo for hardship,' he contended.

Rubio, whose parents immigrated from communist Cuba,then asserted that Paul 'has no idea what he’s talking about.'

Since the president made public his administration's secret talks with Cuba, which took place throughout the fall, Rubio has become the face of the GOP opposition to normalization of diplomatic relations with the country and its president, Raul Castro.

'I would expect that people would understand that if they just took a moment to analyze that, they would realize that the embargo is not what's hurting the Cuban people,' he said last week on Fox in response to Paul's support for the move. 'It's the lack of freedom and the lack of competent leaders.' 

In the pages of the Wall Street Journal, Rubio called the declaration 'a victory for oppressive governments the world over' and a policy shift that is based on a 'lie.'

'Cuba already enjoys access to commerce, money and goods from other nations, and yet the Cuban people are still not free,' he argued.

'They are not free because the regime—just as it does with every aspect of life—manipulates and controls to its own advantage all currency that flows into the island. More economic engagement with the U.S. means that the regime’s grip on power will be strengthened for decades to come—dashing the Cuban people’s hopes for freedom and democracy.' 

Smackdown: Paul trolled Rubio with the above tweet in response to his claim that his colleague 'has no idea what he’s talking about' when it comes to Cuba

Laying out his own views on the issue in Time, Paul made clear on Friday in an op-ed that his family 'despised, not only communism, but collectivism, socialism and any “ism” that deprived the individual of his or her natural rights.'

'I ran for office to fight for the individual and against statism of any kind anywhere and yet… I think a policy of isolationism toward Cuba is misplaced and hasn’t worked,' he said.

Paul explained that he supports engagement with 'many countries with less than stellar human rights records, because I believe that once enslaved people taste freedom and see the products of capitalism they will become hungry for freedom themselves.'

Furthermore, 'it is an inconsistent and incoherent position to support trade with other communist countries, but not communist Cuba,' he wrote, pointing out that the U.S. does not prohibit trade with China nor has it cut off relations with Russia over the past 70 years.

'Let’s hope cooler heads will ultimately prevail and we unleash a trade tsunami that washes the Castros once and for all into the sea,' he concluded.

But in a tweet that afternoon Paul accused Rubio of 'acting like an isolationist who wants to retreat to our borders and perhaps build a moat.'

'I reject this isolationism,' he added.

And in a TV appearance  that evening Paul again ripped into Rubio and derided his retaliatory comments as 'a little bit rude and intemperate.'

Defending himself, Paul told Fox News host Shannon Bream that he's not responsible for beginning the dispute, however. Rubio is to blame for that, he said.

'I never start a fight, but I'm happy to finish a fight,' he stated.

Paul also denied that the squabble was related to either man's political aspirations. 

'I think it's about the issues, I don't think that there's any certainty that either one of us will run at this point,' he said.

He added, 'It's also about a fellow Republican who chose to, I think, use rude and inappropriate language with regard to a fellow Republican, and I think that...I won't stand for it, frankly.

'And if someone's gonna cast aspersions on me, and not talk about policy, then there will be an altercation. And I won't shy away from a battle, and I think that I've shown that.'

Rubio, whose parents immigrated from communist Cuba, has become the face of the GOP opposition to normalization of diplomatic relations with the country and its president, Raul Castro. He is pictured here last Wednesday at a press conference in Miami, where he spoke out against the policy shift

Not one to walk away from a fight himself, Rubio said Sunday that if Paul 'wants to become the chief cheerleader of Obama's foreign policy, he certainly has a right to do that.

'I'm going to continue to oppose the...Obama-Paul foreign policy on Cuba because I know it won't lead to freedom and liberty for the Cuban people, which is my sole interest here,' he argued.

He later stated, in response to a question about former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's candidacy for president, that his own decision in 2016 won't be based on 'anyone else who would decide to run.'

'If someone makes the decision that the best place for them to serve their country, the best place for them to achieve, in my case, an agenda to restore the American dream, if I make the decision that the best place for me to do that is the presidency, then I'm going to run for president,' he said.

The Florida senator followed up his remarks with, 'I haven't made that decision yet.' 

A staffer for Paul responded to Rubio's attacks on his boss by bringing attention to Rubio's views on arming Syrian rebels, striking Libya and giving aid to Egypt.

'With all due respect, Senator Marco Rubio was captain of the GOP cheerleading team for Obama’s arming of Syrian rebels, bombing Libya resulting in a jihadist wonderland, and illegally giving foreign aid to Egypt’s military government,' Paul aide Doug Stafford said in a statement.

'The Rubio-Obama foreign policy has made the Middle East and North Africa less safe,' he said, echoing Paul's comments on twitter.
