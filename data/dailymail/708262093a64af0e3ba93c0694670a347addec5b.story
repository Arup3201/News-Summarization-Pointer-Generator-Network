On first glance, this may look like the kind of vertical ride you find at your average amusement park.

But it's not - it is a whopping 335ft tall.

Busch Gardens' new giant Falcon's Fury ride, the tallest freestanding drop tower in north America, is set to open to the public at the theme park in Tampa, Florida.

When riders get to the top - as many as 32 at one time - their seats are tilted forward 90 degrees so that they're directly facing the ground when released.

And
 during the first 100ft of free fall, they drop at a speed of around 
60mph before a magnetic braking system brings them to a safe and upright
 stop.

During the drop, riders will experience an estimated G-force of 3.5gs.

Engineers had to drive 105 steel support beams as deep as 205ft into the ground before fusing them together with a concrete cap to make it secure.

A 4ft-thick base also secures the steel tower to the foundation.

It isn’t the tallest drop tower in the world.

That honor goes to 415-foot Zumanjaro at Six Flag’s Great Adventure.

But it does look terrifying.
