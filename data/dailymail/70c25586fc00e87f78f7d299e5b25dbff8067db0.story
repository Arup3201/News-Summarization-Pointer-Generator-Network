A five-year-old girl who suffocated at her Texas kindergarten in December last year had choked to death on a pin she swallowed.

Teachers and staff at Corbell Elementary School had tried frantically to save Meaghan Levy's life, but they were unable to revive her.

An autopsy has showed that the little girl from Frisco died because her airway was blocked by a pushpin.

Unexpected: Meaghan was a healthy five-year-old, but she died at her school after choking on a pin

Meaghan's family and teachers had been at a loss to explain how the healthy and cheerful child had suddenly become ill and died on December 12 last year.

Her class had been in the school library when Meaghan approached a teacher with her hands clutched around her neck.

The teacher quickly took her to the nurse's office, but Meaghan collapsed in the school hallway before they could get there.

Once she had been carried inside, an oxygen tank the nurse used to try to revive her allegedly malfunctioned, spraying a caustic chemical over the nurse who had to be taken to hospital, according to the Dallas Observer.

'We were praying; we were talking to her, whispering in her ear, and just begging her to hold on,' Meaghan's aunt, Erika Kennedy said.

Tributes: Corbell Elementary School decorated the campus with pink ribbons in memory of Meaghan

'When you 
have so many questions, and so many unanswered questions, it makes it 
that much harder ... we canâ€™t even begin to grieve,' she told WFAA.

When
 doctors examined X-Rays of Meaghan they suggested that a pin seen in 
her airway could have been the cause of death, but it has only just been
 confirmed by the medical examiner's office.

The death was later ruled an accident.

'When we heard it was a pushpin, that 
really rocked everybody, because it hit home that it could have happened
 to anybody's child,' Dawn Neufeld, whose daughter went to school with Meaghan, said.

'It was so hard on all of them. I have no doubt that every single person at the school did 
everything in their power to help Meaghan that day,' she told Kens5.

Shortly after Meaghan's death her school held a 'pink out' where the campus was decorated with pink ribbons and classmates wore pink in memory of the little girl.

However, family spokesman Daryl Kevin Washington said they believe if the oxygen tank had worked, Meaghan could have been saved.

'We know and we believe that would have played an important role in saving Meaghan's life,' he said.

Meaghan's family hope the little girl's death will bring changes to the school, including a ban on pushpins, CPR training for all teachers, and better checks to ensure medical equipment is working.
