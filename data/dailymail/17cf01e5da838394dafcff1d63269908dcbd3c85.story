Ministers have indicated they are not prepared to block the controversial appointment of an Australian to a senior £200,000-a-year post in the House of Commons.

Despite growing cross-party anger over the selection of Carol Mills as the next clerk, Downing Street is reluctant to become involved for fear it could trigger a constitutional crisis, the Mail understands.

Blocking the appointment – made by a panel led by Commons Speaker John Bercow – would be ‘extraordinary’ and ministers believe there are no grounds for doing so, a source said.

Carol Mills is head of the Department of Parliamentary Services in the Australian Senate in Canberra – a job which involves managing catering and other facilities

The decision means that unless Mrs Mills withdraws her candidature or the Speaker has second thoughts, the appointment could go ahead within weeks.

Currently she is head of the Department of Parliamentary Services in the Australian Senate in Canberra – a job which involves managing catering and other facilities but does not involve detailed understanding of the Australian Constitution.

As Commons clerk in Westminster, Mrs Mills would be required to give the Speaker detailed advice on parliamentary procedure and law, as well as acting as the ‘chief executive’ of the House.

Speaker's choice: John Bercow wants to appoint Carol Mills; Labour MP Kate Hoey wrote on Twitter that she had asked Number 10 to block the appointment

That is despite serious questions about her suitability for the job – and allegations that her department was involved in ‘spying’ on a senior Australian politician in an effort to identify a whistleblower.

Yesterday veteran Labour MP Kate Hoey wrote on Twitter that she had asked Number 10 to block the appointment. And Tory MP Rob Wilson wrote to Leader of the Commons, William Hague, expressing concerns at claims that Mrs Mills’s department ‘oversaw the CCTV spying on a senior Labour senator’s office for the purpose of unmasking a whistleblower and also recorded a senator’s movements’.

The investigation into the claims is not due to report until next year.

He called on Mr Hague and Mr Cameron ‘to use your good offices to find a way to block the appointment of Mrs Mills, at least until such time that matters become clearer’.

Leader of the House William Hague (left) has been on to find a way to block the appointment of Mrs Mills; Robert Rodgers (right), the outgoing clerk, is not only much respected in Westminster but he is also the author of two best-selling books about parliamentary arcana: Order! Order! and Who Goes Home?

He said the appointment could be ‘extremely damaging’ to Parliament.

Yesterday a Whitehall source said he ‘would not expect’ Number 10 to intervene. ‘For the Government to overturn the decision of the Speaker and the Speaker’s panel would be extraordinary,’ he added.

Former Speaker Betty Boothroyd has warned that Mrs Mills would be ‘totally out of her depth’. She said Speaker Bercow may have made the appointment because he wants to get his own way and ‘not refer to anybody or not take anybody’s advice’.

Outgoing clerk Sir Robert Rogers has had a difficult relationship with Mr Bercow. His deputy, David Natzler, was a leading candidate for the role, but was not selected.

He has reportedly asked for documents relating to the selection process, raising suspicions he may launch a legal challenge.

A Cabinet Office spokesman said they would not be drawn on the issue, adding: ‘This is a matter for the Speaker of the House of Commons.’
