A British student accused of running an 'illegal' website from his university bedroom could be extradited to the U.S. within weeks.

Richard O’Dwyer faces trial and up to ten years in jail for offences which his lawyers say are not even a crime in this country.

The 23-year-old founded the TVShack.net site which published links to illegal download sites - though he himself did not illegally store copyrighted material.

Yesterday the family was told that Home Secretary Theresa May had signed an order authorising his extradition.

Not happy: Richard O'Dwyer, right, is facing extradition to the U.S. His mother Julia, left, claims he is being 'sold down the river' by the Government

It prompted his mother Julia to launch an impassioned attack on the Government for allowing Britons to be 'sold down the river'.

Branding the decision to send her son to the U.S. ‘disgusting’, Mrs 
O’Dwyer argued he should stand trial in this country and not thousands 
of miles away.

She cited the case of computer hacker Gary McKinnon who has spent a 
decade fighting extradition over allegations he hacked into defence 
department computers, and that of British businessman Christopher 
Tappin, who is being held in a Texas jail over arms dealing.

Mrs O’Dwyer, a nurse from Chesterfield, said: 'The U.S. is coming for 
the young, the old and the ill and our Government is paving the way.

Mr O¿Dwyer's website, TVShack.net, published links to other sites where films and TV programmes could be illegally downloaded

Controversial: Richard O'Dwyer's extradition to the U.S. was authorised by Home Secretary Theresa May, pictured, this afternoon

'If 
Richard appears to have committed a crime in this country then try him 
in this country.

‘Instead the Home Secretary wants to send him thousands of miles away 
and leave him languishing, just like Chris Tappin, in a U.S. jail, 
before he has a chance to demonstrate his innocence, under British law, 
of the allegations made against him.’

She added: 'It’s disgusting. Next time it may be your son. I urge 
everyone who cares about unfair extradition to write to their MP and 
insist this disreputable law is changed.'

Despite not downloading any of the illegal material himself, the ‘quiet and 
vulnerable’ son of a GP was arrested and charged. In January a court 
ruled there was no reason not to send him overseas.

Critics say it is the latest example of how the ‘lopsided’ 2003 
Extradition Act is hurting Britons who lack the same rights as U.S. 
citizens in the same situation.

Mr McKinnon, who has Asperger’s Syndrome, faces being sent to the U.S. 
on charges of computer hacking, despite experts warning he is a suicide 
risk.

He claims he was searching for evidence of ‘little green men’ when he hacked into U.S. military computers.

Mr O’Dwyer’s lawyer Ben Cooper said the site did not store copyright 
material itself, and operated in the same way as search engines such as 
Google and Yahoo.

Possible problems: Obama and Cameron could be about to clash on the Anglo-American extradition agreement

Court papers allege the site made around £150,000 from advertising revenue from January 2008 until it was shut down in 2010.

Mr O’Dwyer could now appeal to the High Court, and then to the European 
Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, in a bid to block moves to 
extradite him.

Worrying: Asperger's sufferer Gary McKinnon is still awaiting the Home Secretary's decision on whether he will be extradited to the U.S

His mother accused David Cameron of being ‘wet’, adding: ‘He’s not going
to be saying anything much to President Obama.

'And he won’t get much of
an answer either.’ In December, MPs unanimously backed a call for 
action against extradition laws.

A Home Office spokesman said Mrs May signed the order ‘having carefully 
considered all relevant matters’. He said: ‘Richard O’Dwyer is wanted in
the U.S. for offences related to copyright infringement connected to 
the TVShack.net website.

‘It is alleged that between December 2007 and June 2010, Mr O’Dwyer 
owned and operated TVShack.net which collected and catalogued links to 
websites containing illegal copies of copyrighted material including 
films, TV programmes and music.’

He added: ‘The district judge found the allegations were comparable to 
an offence under UK law and it was appropriate for any trial to be held 
in the U.S.’
