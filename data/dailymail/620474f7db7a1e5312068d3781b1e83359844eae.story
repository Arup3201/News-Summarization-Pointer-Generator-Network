Amid celebrations to mark the 45th anniversary of the first moon landing, former Nasa administrator Michael Griffin has warned that Russia has the U.S in a ‘hostage situation’ over its ability to send men to space.

Mr Griffin has underscored that the U.S, since it cancelled its Shuttle program in 2011, relies on Russia’s Soyuz spacecraft to get its astronauts to the International Space Station.

However, this arrangement is in jeopardy, with tension between the two nations the highest it’s been since the end of the Cold War in 1991. They have been trading tit-for-tat sanctions over the conflict in Ukraine and their relationship turned even frostier after the downing of MH17 last Thursday.

Reliance: U.S astronauts currently hitch rides into space on board Russian Soyuz rockets

Griffin told ABC News: ‘We’re in a hostage situation. Russia can decide that no more U.S. astronauts will launch to the International Space Station and that’s not a position that I want our nation to be in.’

Secretary of State John Kerry lamented over the weekend that the level of trust between Washington and Moscow is now at a low ebb.

Even before the attack on MH17, Russia had declared that it may stop letting U.S astronauts hitch rides to the ISS.

Warning: Former Nasa boss Michael Griffin has said that Russia can hold the U.S 'hostage' over space travel

Russia’s deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin said in May that Moscow was planning ‘strategic changes’ to its space program and warned: ‘The Russian segment [of the ISS] can exist independently from the American one. The U.S. one cannot.’

However, Nasa’s ability to launch humans into space once more took a giant leap earlier in July with the signing of a $2.8billion contract with Boeing to build a giant rocket it is hoped will take us into deep space, possibly on manned missions to Mars.

It comes as the team complete the Critical Design Review (CDR) on the core stage – the last major review before full production begins.

'Our teams have dedicated themselves to ensuring that the Space Launch System (SLS) – the largest ever - will be built safely, affordably and on time,' said Virginia Barnes, Boeing SLS vice president and program manager.

'We are passionate about Nasa’s mission to explore deep space.

'It’s a very personal mission, as well as a national mandate.'

This milestone marks Nasa’s first CDR on a deep-space human exploration launch vehicle since 1961, when the Saturn V rocket underwent a similar design review as the United States sought to land an astronaut on the moon.

Scheduled for its initial test flight in 2017, the SLS is designed to be flexible and evolvable to meet a variety of crew and cargo mission needs.

California-based SpaceX is also striving to put humans into space.

Russia’s deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin warned in May that 'the Russian segment [of the ISS] can exist independently from the American one, the U.S. one cannot'

Its Falcon 9 reusable development vehicle is already in test mode and it will eventually deliver the smaller Dragon capsule containing humans into space.

The Dragon made history in 2012 when it became the first commercial spacecraft to deliver cargo to the International Space Station and safely return cargo to Earth, a feat previously achieved only by governments.

Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first men on the moon on July 20, 1969.

Ten more U.S. astronauts followed in their footsteps before the Apollo program was canceled in 1972. No one has been back since.
