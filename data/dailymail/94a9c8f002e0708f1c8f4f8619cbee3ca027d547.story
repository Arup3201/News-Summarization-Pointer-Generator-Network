The Bank of England will keep the base rate at 0.5 per cent for another three years in a move that cripples cash-strapped savers, say leading analysts.

The prediction by Capital Economics came as the Bank yesterday revealed it was yet again freezing the base rate at the lowest level in its 318-year history.

It coincides with the third anniversary of the cut to 0.5 per cent in March 2009 – and raises the prospect of the base rate staying at this level until 2015. The economic consultancy’s forecast is a devastating blow for savers, who have seen their nest eggs badly hit by rock-bottom rates.

Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ‘We think that they could stay at this level [0.5 per cent] for another three years.’

She also raised the possibility that the Bank could cut rates to 0.25 per cent, saying: ‘Official interest rates could fall even further.’

Simon Rose of campaign group Save our Savers said the Bank’s slashing of the base rate had placed ‘a grossly unfair and disproportionate burden’ on savers and pensioners.

Future interest rates? This graph, published by the Bank of England, shows how interest rates have been held at their historic low of 0.5% since March 2009. It may be 2015 before they begin to rise. On the right are Bank of England predictions, from Feb 2012 and Nov 2011, about when rates will increase

‘This is an extraordinary and monstrously unjust transfer of wealth from savers and pensioners,’ he added.

Louise Cooper, a markets analyst at BGC Partners, said savers were being ‘crushed’.

The record low interest rates have 
robbed savers of £76billion over the past three years, compared with the
higher rates they were paid in the previous three.

Rates held: Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King has repeatedly expressed his sympathy for savers as rates have been kept at 0.5%

The rates have benefited around eight
million homeowners with variable or tracker-rate mortgages, whose 
repayments have fallen sharply.

The Bank also today held its 
quantitative easing programme - otherwise known as money-printing - at 
£325billion after injecting £50billion into the economy last month.

The combination of low rates and high levels of QE has been particularly painful for savers and those approaching retirement.

It is thought that more than 
£100billion is sitting in accounts which pay no interest, according to 
Bank figures, compared with around £15bn to £20bn in the years before 
the financial crisis.

The 
Bank’s Governor, Sir Mervyn King, has repeatedly expressed his sympathy 
for savers but has said the stimulus measures are needed to help the 
economy.

With the base rate at a historic low,
mortgage repayments for new borrowers have reached their most 
affordable levels for 14 years.

However, there are signs that this trend is on the turn.

The Bank of Ireland's move to hike ratesn yesterday will cost their 100,000 customers around £1,500 a year.

At
present, the Bank of Ireland, which is one of Britain’s top ten 
lenders, charges 2.99 per cent on its standard variable rate mortgages. 
This will be raised in stages to 4.49 per cent by September.

The
repayments of a typical homeowner with a £150,000 mortgage, currently 
£711 a month, will rise to £833, an increase of £122 a month or £1,464 a
year.

Last week, 
Halifax revealed plans to increase its standard variable rate from 3.5 
per cent to 3.99 per cent in May, affecting 850,000 customers.

Like
the Halifax, the Bank of Ireland blamed the decision on higher funding 
costs, which it insists means it must raise its mortgage rates.

The move by the Bank of Ireland comes days after Halifax shocked customers with a sudden rise in one of its most popular mortgages

A spokesman said: ‘The cost of 
funding mortgages has increased significantly for UK lenders in recent 
years, including Bank of Ireland. For this reason, it is necessary for 
Bank of Ireland to increase its standard variable rate.’

The decision does not affect 
home-buyers who have a mortgage with the Post Office, even though the 
Bank of Ireland is the network’s financial services partner.

The bank’s current rate is much lower than most of its rivals’ standard variable rate deal.

Santander, the Co-op and Northern Rock charge more than four per cent, while other lenders charge more than five per cent.

A Council of Mortgage Lenders 
spokesman said: ‘Bank and building societies continue to face 
challenging conditions in the markets that typically provide their 
funding – savings and wholesale markets.

‘Problems in the eurozone have been 
causing significant difficulties in recent months, and funding costs are
higher than they were a year ago.’
