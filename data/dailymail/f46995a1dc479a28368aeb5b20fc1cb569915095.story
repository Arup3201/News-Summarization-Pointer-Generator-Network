The clinic where Joan Rivers suffered a fatal complication during a routine surgery has lost its federal accreditation and will stop receiving funds at the end of this month.

In a letter sent to Yorkville Endoscopy in Manhattan, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services told the clinic it no longer meets their conditions for coverage.

'Therefore, CMS is terminating the Medicare Health Benefits Agreement between Yorkville Endoscopy and the Secretary, effective January 31, 2015,' it said on Monday.

'As of January 31, 2015 Yorkville Endoscopy will no longer be eligible to receive federal funds for services provided to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.'

Loss: Joan Rivers, pictured right with her daughter Melissa, died in September after suffering a complication during surgery at an endoscopy clinic in Manhattan. The clinic has now lost its federal accreditation

The decision means that the private clinic will no longer receive Medicare and Medicaid funding, but it will still receive money from other paying customers.

Rivers died of brain damage in September, when she was 81, after she stopped breathing during a botched endoscopy at the Upper East Side clinic on August 28.

After her death, a startling report from CMS said Yorkville 'failed to identify deteriorating vital signs' and violated Rivers' right to privacy when a staff member took pictures of her while she was sedated.

Following the complaint, the clinic submitted a plan of correction to CMS, promising to better handle anesthesia, respect patient privacy and improve emergency and review protocols.

But when investigators returned to the clinic in December, they found the plan of correction had not been properly satisfied, and they continued to find fire hazards and failures in its reviewing systems, according to the report released on Monday.

During the re-visit, they found that patients were discharged before anesthesiologists had properly evaluated their conditions after surgery. One anesthesiologist told the agents that she was just too busy to sign off on patients' forms. 

Failings: Yorkville Endoscopy, which is in Manhattan's Upper East Side, will no longer receive federal funding for Medicare and Medicaid patients from the end of this month, it has emerged 

They also found that 'the facility was not constructed, arranged, and maintained to ensure the safety of patients', including leaks and damp through the building.

Equipment used for medical gas had also not been inspected in nearly two years, while the air pressure was not low enough in the decontamination room, the report found. 

It also listed some patient grievances that the clinic had never fully resolved. In one, a Spanish patient complained that her anesthesiologist laughed at her when she made a mistake and that she felt 'scared and ignored' while at the clinic. 

If Yorkville disagrees with the decision to terminate the Medicare agreement, it can request a hearing before a judge at the Departmental Appeals Board within 60 days, CMS said.

In a statement on Monday, the clinic said: 'We are continuing to work with all regulatory bodies. We intend to communicate with CMS and appropriate authorities to have the decision reversed.

'Yorkville continues to be a licensed facility and perform procedures while cooperating with the regulatory process.'

Negligence was not alleged in the report, but Rivers' daughter has hired a malpractice attorney to look into her death and lawyers said they plan to file a wrongful-death suit against the clinic.

After the inspections' initial finding were released, the lawyers said in a statement that Melissa Rivers was 'terribly disappointed to learn of the multiple failings'.

'As any of us would be, Ms. Rivers is outraged by the misconduct and mismanagement now shown to have occurred before, during and after the procedure,' it said.

'Moving forward, Ms. Rivers will direct her efforts towards ensuring that what happened to her mother will not occur again with any other patient.'
