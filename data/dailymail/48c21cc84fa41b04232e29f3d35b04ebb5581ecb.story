A San Diego cable company employee expecting a shipment of fiberglass equipment got a shock when he discovered two newborn kittens clinging to life inside the box.

KGTV reports Thursday that the kittens are recovering after being accidentally shipped by truck from the Los Angeles area to a Cox Communications office in San Diego.

Upon finding the tiny black cats, a Cox warehouse worker called his nephew, who happens to work for the Humane Society in San Diego.

Kittens Mouse and Wifi were discovered by a San Diego cable company employee inside box he thought would contain a shipment of fiberglass equipment

When the kittens reached the local Humane Society they were completely starved and immediately latched on to a bottle

An employee at Cox Communications found the fuzzy package and immediately contacted the Humane Society

'Mom probably had the babies, found the cable equipment to be a very 
nice, warm, safe spot to put them, left them there while she went to go 
hunt,' the Humane Society's Kitten Nursery Manager, Jenny Bonomini, told MyFoxPhilly.

The pair have been named Mouse and Wi-Fi.

'They didn't have their eyes open. They had their umbilical cords attached. They hadn't eaten since they were shipped,' Bonomini said.

The pair now live in a cubby with a heating pad and a fuzzy blanket

Though initially starving, the kittens are now eating every few hours and steadily gaining weight

Upon discovering the starving kittens, Bonomini gave them a bottle, which they immediately began to drink from.Â 

Just two weeks later they're putting on weight and have each reached about 200 grams. They eat roughly every two to three hours.

Humane Society officials said the animals were likely saved by a combination of the box's warmth and the Cox employees quick thinking

Humane Society's Kitten Nursery Manager, Jenny Bonomini  said their mother probably thought the box would be a safe, warm spot to leave her babies while she went to hunt

The are living in a cubby furnished with a heating pad and fuzzy blanket.

A combination of the warmth of the package they were shipped in along with the Cox employee's quick reaction to finding them likely saved their lives.

'Right now they're pretty reliant on us just giving them love and nutrition but in about a week everything changes,' Bonomini said.
