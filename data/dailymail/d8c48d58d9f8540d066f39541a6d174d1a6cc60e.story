The Phoenix-based company that publishes the long-running SkyMall in-flight catalogue has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in a US court.

Xhibit Corp and its subsidiaries, including SkyMall LLC, are seeking to sell off their assets in a sale to be supervised by the US Bankruptcy Court in Arizona, the Wall Street Journal reports.

In court papers obtained by the newspaper, Scott Wiley, the company’s chief financial officer and acting chief executive, said the magazine has become a victim of increased competition and changing times.

He said fewer people are browsing the in-flight catalogue with the increased use of electronic devices on planes.

Available on many US flights, the in-flight catalogue is facing greater competition for sales and passengers’ attention now that more airlines are providing wifi access, he added.

SkyMall is celebrating its silver anniversary this year, declaring itself a retailer of ’25 years of cool stuff’.

The quarterly publication is known for its quirky products – from travel accessories and exercise equipment to garden gnomes and cat toys.

According to its website, SkyMall’s top-selling items include a barbecue spatula with a built-in torch, a computer mouse shaped like a car, sofa dog beds, and a T-shirt reading ‘Of course I’m right. I’m Bob.’

In a statement, Mr Wiley said: ‘We are extremely disappointed in this result and are hopeful that SkyMall and the iconic SkyMall brand find a home to continue to operate as SkyMall has for the last 25 years.’

But the company has not found a buyer and is poised to proceed with a sale of SkyMall and its online retail business.

Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and US Airways were named as SkyMall’s largest unsecured creditors, the Wall Street Journal reported.
