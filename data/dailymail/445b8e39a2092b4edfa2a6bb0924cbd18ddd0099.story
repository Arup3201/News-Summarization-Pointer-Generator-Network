Dejan Lovren has launched a scathing attack on Southampton, blasting his current club for not informing him of Liverpool's bid for the player.

Speaking to Sportske Novosti in Croatia, the 25-year-old spoke of his dismay at the way recent interest from the Reds has been handled, claiming he wasn't even told of their recent £20million offer.

'Liverpool sent the offer and the club haven't informed me,' he said.

'Not even about the subsequent Liverpool bids. That wasn't right. I found out about the bid from other people which disappointed me and I realised I've got no business staying at Southampton.

'Frankly, my head is already at Liverpool.'

Lovren also spoke of his dismay at the lack of ambition shown by the club this summer, with manager Mauricio Pochettino, and key players Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana and Luke Shaw all leaving St Mary's.

'Look, I'd gladly stay in Southampton if the club had any ambitions, if they kept the key players. [If that had happened] not even the Liverpool bid would have dissuaded me.'
