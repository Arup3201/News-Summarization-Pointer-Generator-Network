It is the perfect solution for those seeking a palatial residence... for their pampered poultry.

But to keep hens in such royal luxury, you must be prepared to shell out an eye-watering £3,750.

This hen house is being sold by Prince Charles’s Highgrove estate in Gloucestershire and is inspired by the birds he keeps there.

The made-to-order Highgrove Hen House is built using Forest Stewardship Council-certified timber, which means it was sourced from a responsibly managed forest, and decorated with eggshell blue water-based paint.

The roof is natural cedar, the wheels are cast iron and other fixtures are in galvanised steel.

Each house sleeps four to eight chickens and features two nest boxes, adjustable perches and stable-style doors.

Made by Wildlife World, a Gloucestershire firm, the hen houses are being sold on the Highgrove website which describes the design as ‘unique and innovative’.

Proceeds – as with all items sold on the website – will go to charities supported  by Charles.

But a spokesman for the prince admitted yesterday that none has yet been sold.

‘We only launched the hen house in March and we have had a lot of inquiries but no firm orders yet,’ said the spokesman, adding that the houses ‘reflect the interests of Highgrove’.

‘We are confident the hen houses will sell well, and especially at the time of the Christmas market.’

Highgrove’s website says: ‘Our very first Hen House has been inspired by the poultry kept on the Highgrove Estate by HRH The Prince of Wales, who is Patron of The Poultry Club of Great Britain.’

Highgrove is selling a matching beehive which, it says, ‘allows bees to live in an environment which is sustainable and low-impact, more akin to their natural environment’.

The hive has a base trough filled with natural woodland material creating an enclosed natural ecosystem that allows beneficial insects to live in harmony with the bees.

Charles has spoken publicly about the plight of the bee and, as well as keeping his own bees, supports beekeepers’ associations through The Prince’s Countryside Fund.

Like the hen house, each beehive is bespoke, takes eight to 12 weeks to be produced and has a hefty price tag – each costs £1,250.
