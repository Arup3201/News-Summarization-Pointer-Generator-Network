Real Madrid are on the verge of agreeing the most lucrative stadium deal of all time as the European champions prepare to sell the naming rights of their stadium.

According to Spanish newspaper Marca, Real will bring in around €500milliion (£390million) over the next 20 years by renaming the Bernabeu.

The deal with International Petroleum Investment Company, which is owned by the Abu Dhabi royal family, has been in negotiations for several months, and is close to being signed.

Madrid are worried about the fans' reaction but the deal would net the club a huge amount of money

Opened: 1944 as New Chamartin

Capacity: 85,000 

Showpiece matches: World Cup final 1982 

European Cup finals 1957, 1969, 1980, 2010

European Championship final 1964 

Named after former Real Madrid chairman Santiago Bernabeu 

It would pave the way for Real to expand their stadium, which club president Florentino Perez wants to begin as soon as possible.

The deal could be announced at the club's General Assembly which is currently underway.

However, Perez is worried about the reaction of fans to any possible renaming, with the move thought to be unpopular among the Spanish club's supporters. 

Stadium naming is commonplace in England, with Arsenal's Emirates Stadium and Manchester City's the Etihad Stadium prime examples.
