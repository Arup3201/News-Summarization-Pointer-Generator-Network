Hollywood A-listers sat shoulder to shoulder with political leaders, sporting stars and a certain Spice Girl turned fashion mogul in a Royal Box heaving with household names as Andy Murray battled his way to victory at a sweltering SW19 yesterday.

As the Scotsman beat the world number one Novak Djokovic to become Wimbledon champion in a gripping straight sets victory, he was roared on by everyone from Victoria Beckham to Hangover-star Bradley Cooper, and Wayne Rooney to David Cameron.

Wimbledon legend Rod Laver, who claimed victory at the All England Tennis Club no less than four times during his career, sat next to Labour leader Ed Miliband, while WAG Colleen Rooney and actress and model Suki Waterhouse added to the glamorous female contingent absorbing all the action on Centre Court.

Household names: Film stars Bradley Cooper and Gerard Butler took their seats alongside Victoria Beckham and Prime Minister David Cameron to watch from the Royal Box as Andy Murray stormed to victory at Wimbledon

As the eyes of 
the country focused on this small corner of South West London yesterday 
afternoon, the best seats in the house were reserved for an eclectic 
mixture of high-profile fans.

Many
of those taking their seats in the Royal Box were former players who 
once reigned supreme on Wimbledon's grass courts themselves; from 
American Stan Smith - who held the trophy aloft in 1972 - to Spaniard 
Manuel Santana, who was crowned champion in 1966. Former British number 
one Greg Rusedski also brought along wife Lucy Connor to enjoy all the 
action courtside.

Glamour: Upping the glamour stakes in the Royal Box were Victoria Beckham, who kept her cool in a black dress as she took her seat next to Gordon Ramsay's wife Tana, and Colleen Rooney, who wore a white dress to watch the action on Centre Court alongside her husband Wayne

And it wasn't just champions from the tennis world taking their seats in the exclusive section - footballer Wayne Rooney watched alongside wife Colleen, while golfing star Justin Rose, there to take in the match with his wife Kate, was spotted laughing with actor Gerard Butler.

Butler, the star of Hollywood blockbusters including 300 and PS I Love You, attracted almost as much attention as his fellow countryman Andy Murray's efforts on court yesterday, as he and fellow film star Bradley Cooper brought a dash of A-list glamour to the box in co-ordinating summery blue suits and shades.

Cooper was also accompanied by his 
girlfriend, British model and actress Suki Waterhouse, but seemed to pay
more attention to Butler as the pair played up to the cameras capturing
their every reaction to the increasingly tense match. Ms Waterhouse 
meanwhile was left to chat to the Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn 
King, who was sitting to her right.

The
world of politics was also well represented, with Prime Minister David 
Cameron applauding Andy Murray's every winning shot from the front row, 
accompanied by his mother Mary.

Behind
him was Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond, who was branded a 
'grade one wally' for gleefully unfurling a giant Saltire flag behind Mr
Cameron as Murray was crowned victor - in what many saw as a political 
ploy to gain support for Scottish independence.

Also looking on were Maria Miller, Culture, Media and Sport Secretary, and her husband Iain, and Chief of the Defence Staff General Sir David Richards, while acclaimed classical pianist Mitsuko Uchido, wearing a quirky pair of glasses, appeared deep in conversation with the Duke of Kent in the front row.

There were jubilant scenes in the Royal Box as Andy Murray sealed his much longed-for victory to take the title, but not everybody in the section was entirely thrilled with the result.

Sitting alongside Ed Miliband's wife Justine Thornton was Tomislav Nikolic, the Serbian president, who was no doubt disappointed to see Djokovic dispatched in straight sets by the Scotsman.

Former stars: Greg Rusedki, the former British number one, watched the Scotsman and the Serbian battle it out alongside his wife Lucy Connor in soaring temperatures on Centre Court

Eclectic mixture: Ed Miliband shared a joke with four-time Wimbledon champion Rod Laver in the Royal Box, as Colleen and Wayne Rooney, and Victoria Beckham and Tana Ramsay watched from the rows behind

Sporting champions: The Royal Box was awash with sporting talent yesterday, and not just from the world of tennis; footballer Wayne Rooney was there, left, as was South African born English golfer Justin Rose, right

The Royal Box has been reserved for the entertainment of friends and guests of Wimbledon since 1922.

The guest list is made up of members of the British and foreign royal families, heads of government, big names from the tennis world, the tournament's commercial partners and the British Armed Forces.

Representatives of prominent media organisations, supporters of British tennis are also among those lucky enough to make the cut.

Invitations come from the Chairman of the All England Club, and take into account suggestions from members of The Championships' Organising Committee and the Lawn Tennis Assocation along with other relevant partners.

The jovial atmosphere evident in the Royal Box yesterday will have continued after Murray raised the trophy, as guests are invited to the Clubhouse for lunch, tea and drinks at the end of the day.

Prime Minister David Cameron's suit and tie provoked a lot of reaction on Twitter given the soaring temperatures, but he was merely following protocol, as male guests in the Royal Box are asked to wear smart dress such as a suit or jacket and tie.

Ladies are asked not to wear hats to prevent obscuring the view of those sitting behind them.
