Texas Governor Rick Perry say on Thursday that there's a 'very real possibility' that Islamic extremists have infiltrated the United States through its porous southern border.

'I think there is the obvious great concern that because of the 
condition of the border, from the standpoint of it not being secure and 
us not knowing who is penetrating across, that individuals from ISIS or 
other terrorist states could be [coming in],' Perry told attendees of a Washington, D.C. event.

And while he admitted that 'we have no clear 
evidence of that,' Perry said 'your common sense tells you' that it may 
have happened given how many criminals from other countries have
 crossed border illegally.

Use your common sense: Texas Governor Rick Perry admitted that 'we have no clear evidence' that Islamic extremists are sneaking in the country through the shouter border, but claimed 'your common sense tells you' that it may have happened

'I’m talking about the assaults, the rapes, the murders by individuals 
who have come into this country illegally over the last five years.

'The 
idea that they would not be looking at and managing any of those types 
of attacks from that region is not a good place to be,' he added.

The Republican governor told the National Review Online that people from countries known for terrorism are crossing over to border in greater numbers, and it is a cause for concern.

'We know that there are individuals from countries that have 
terrorist ties that are being apprehended and we had reports of record 
high numbers of those individuals who were coming in back in the 
summer,' he said.

The embattled Texas governor dropped by the nation's capitol on Thursday to speak at the Heritage Foundation on the immigration crisis.

But the likely 2016 presidential candidate hit on other topics as well, including the conflict in Iraq.

His remarks on the subject gave way to questions about jihadists permeating the United States through it's border with Mexico, which is 
also the Texas border, and his opinion on how the U.S. should be handling the Islamic State.

'They need to be eliminated,' they need to be eliminated 
now,' he said of the terrorist organization.

Perry said he did not think the president should be ruling out a strategy that involves putting combat groups on the ground nor should he be revealing his hand to his enemies.

'I think signaling to your enemies what 
you are not going to put on the table is very very bad, both strategical
 and tactical errors by this administration,' he said. 'We need to have all of our 
options open.'

The Republican politician said he understood the country was weary of war, yet he cautioned attendees that the costs of inaction could be far worse than those associated with a military operation.

'For many Americans, of course, just the last thing we want to think 
about is more conflict in Iraq and what that might involve,' he said.

'But we better get on top of this crisis by every means necessary 
because events are moving fast and the price is only going to move up.'

Perry appeared calm and collected throughout his appearance at the 35 minute event on Thursday afternoon despite facing chaos back at home.

The Lone Star State governor was formally charged this week with two felonies over an alleged abuse of power after he vetoed funding for a government agency that investigates corruption.

Perry briefly touched on the topic at the beginning of his remarks before moving on to his speech.

'I am very confident in my case, and I can assure you that I will fight this attack of our system of government,' he said.
