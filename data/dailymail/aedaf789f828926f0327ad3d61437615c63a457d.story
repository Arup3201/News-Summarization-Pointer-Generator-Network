As if taking off and landing on time isn't enough of a challenge, Delta Airlines has today begun racing against the clock to get baggage to passengers after they land.

Delta is trialling a 20 minutes or less guarantee to get checked luggage to the carousel from domestic flights in the US and Puerto Rico until March 21.

If the bags don't make it in time for the SkyMiles customers - the only passengers eligible - Delta will issue 2,500 bonus miles to their account.

Delta Airlines has pledged customers they'll get their baggage within 20 minutes or they get 2,500 air miles

Baggage handlers will be racing against the clock as the airline trials the promotion until March 31

- Trial deal runs only until March 31

- Only to eligible SkyMiles members

- Only for domestic flights in the US and Puerto Rico

- Online request form must be submitted within three days landing

- Delta decides who gets the bonus miles

- Only one claim per arrival, regardless of how many bags were carried

- Lost, mishandled, and damaged bags are excluded

- Oversize and overweight baggage and special items arn't eligible

'We're committed to providing you with reliable and on-time baggage service every time you fly,' Delta's website says. 

'That's why we're backing your bags with a guarantee: if your checked bag doesn't arrive at the carousel in 20 minutes or less after any domestic flight through March 31, 2015, you are eligible to receive 2,500 bonus miles.'

Customers need to fill out a simple online form with their name, email address, SkyMiles number along with flight and trip confirmation numbers to claim their miles.

Naturally with such a deal, the fine print is extensive and is only good news to those travellers who will have checked in a bag anyway for a minimum fee of $25 for a flight within the US and Canada.

The '20-minute Bag-to-Claim Guarantee bonus-mile offer', as it's officially described, is valid only for travel between February 19 and March 31 this year, and claims must be made within three days of landing.

It is valid for all domestic flights within the US and Puerto Rico that are marketed and operated by Delta Air Lines.

The deal is valid for all full fare domestic flights within the US and Puerto Rico that are operated by Delta

'Itineraries that include Delta Connection and codeshare flights are eligible as long as the final leg is marketed and operated by Delta Air Lines,' say the terms and conditions.

The time it takes for bags to get to the baggage claim will be judged by Delta's baggage tracking system, where available, and they say 'lost, mishandled, and damaged bags are excluded.' As are oversize and overweight baggage and special items.

The airline has also covered itself in the event there is 'a baggage system malfunction, severe weather, or other conditions out of Delta's control that would prevent timely baggage delivery.'

Delta is following in the footsteps of Alaska Airlines, which has its own 20-minute promise and made their rivals know about it.

AA also offers 2,500 miles for bags that take longer than 20 minutes to arrive.

Alaska Air also gives customers a choice between the miles and a $25 voucher.

Alaska Air tweeted after Delta announced its trial via email to customers: "Celebrating millions and millions of bags delivered in 20 minutes or less."
