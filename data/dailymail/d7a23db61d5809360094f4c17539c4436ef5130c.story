Angel di Maria and Alexis Sanchez have been two of the stand-out performers so far this season.

Di Maria is like a modern-day Ryan Giggs, changing defence to attack in an instant. He makes lots of high-intensity runs but dribbles from central areas and from deep.

That makes him a threat because central midfielders often lack the pace and defensive mindset to cope, whereas full backs are more used to duels with quick wingers.

In the past, wide men were your best players but now they are coming inside - Ronaldo, Bale, Di Maria — to wreak havoc in the middle.

Sanchez has the rest of Arsenal dancing to his tune. His work rate is infectious and he battled with Vincent Kompany all game on Saturday. He plays higher up than Di Maria but gives Arsene Wenger new options.

The only way to stop them is to cut the supply line and try and get tight early to deny them space. Otherwise you’ll be left eating their dust.
