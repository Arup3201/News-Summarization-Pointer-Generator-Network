Apple has revealed it is working to expand the diversity of the hugely popular emoji characters for the iPhone.

Following complaints that the current character set was not diverse enough, the firm said it was working with the standards body that controls them.

Because Emoji have to be displayed on different devices, they are tightly controlled by the Unicode Consortium.

Spreading like wildfire: The top trending word of the year so far is emoji ¿ small digital images (pictured) used to express an idea or emotion in electronic communication - which are used by millions of people in emails and on social media

Emoji were originally popular in Japan, and widely used online.

However, in recent years they have become hugely popular elsewhere.

Japanese electronic messages and webpages, whose use is spreading outside Japan. Originally meaning pictograph, the word emoji literally means "picture" (e) + "letter" (moji).

Icons are standardised, and include some specific to Japanese culture, such as a bowing (apologizing) businessman, a face wearing a face mask, a white flower used to denote 'brilliant homework' or a group of emoji representing popular foods: ramen noodles, dango, onigiri, Japanese curry, and sushi.

Some emoji character sets have been incorporated into Unicode, allowing them to be used elsewhere in the world - and more could noww be added.

At present the list of characters contains dozens of faces of people that appear to be white.

However, only two of the symbols seem to be Asian and none are black.

Since 2010 a basic list has been developed and maintained by the Unicode Consortium - a Silicon Valley-based non-profit organisation made up of major computer firms, software producers, user groups and others.It does this to ensure that different devices and mobile carriers can share a basic set.

The latest disclosure came after Apple boss Tim Cook was emailed asking if the firm was going to address the issue.

Apple's Katie Cotton replied, telling MTV: 'Tim forwarded your email to me.

'We agree with you.

'Our emoji characters are based on the Unicode standard, which is necessary for them to be displayed properly across many platforms. 

'There needs to be more diversity in the emoji character set, and we have been working closely with the Unicode Consortium in an effort to update the standard.'

Miley Cyrus joined the calls to make emoji more diverse

The diversity of emoji was also questioned in a petition posted to DoSomething.org calling on Apple to increase the ethnic diversity found within its emoji keyboard.

'Of the more than 800 Emojis, the only two resembling people of color are a guy who looks vaguely Asian and another in a turban,' it says.

'There's a white boy, girl, man, woman, elderly man, elderly woman, blonde boy, blonde girl and, we're pretty sure, [video game character] Princess Peach.'

A petition suggested that emoji like these could be added to Apple's keyboard

'But when it comes to faces outside of yellow smileys, there's a staggering lack of minority representation.'

It added that the keyboard already offered a graphic showing a same-sex couple, and called on the company to present people with a wider range of skin tones.
