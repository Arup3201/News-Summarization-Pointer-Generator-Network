His smart cream shoes dusted of desert sand, the Prince of Wales continued his tour of Saudi Arabia with a traditional sword dance at a Bedouin camp last night. 

Standing with his knees bent and feet shoulder-width apart, the heir smiled alongside local men as they jolted scimitars in the air, swaying from side to side. 

And while his navy blazer and beige chinos were a far cry from the flowing robes and headbands of those standing beside him, the Prince tried his utmost to fit in with locals at the camp found near the town of Onaizah.

Public executions, most often in the form of beheading, are commonplace in Saudi Arabia which observes Sharia law.

Stoning is reserved for those found to have committed adultery with those sentenced to sedated before being killed.

With ceremonial daggers in their waistbands, the men looked like fearsome warriors as they made space for the future king when he was led over to them.

Earlier in the day Charles was seen sporting a dapper cream suit and black sunglasses. 

The 66-year-old looked every inch the stylish traveller as he struck a pose outside the remains of the ancient city of Al-Ula.

With him was Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince, Sultan bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, who in 1985, became the first royal to venture into space.

Yesterday's visit was considerably more down to earth, with the two royal princes taking in a clutch of historical sites. 

Charles also had to deal with a choking desert dust storm, which although uncomfortable, appeared to leave him unfazed.

The swirling clouds of dust had given his private jet a bumpy landing, as he later told Prince Sultan while they boarded a tourist coach to the first site.

Charles' first stop was at Al-Khuraibah, the ancient capital of the Kingdom of Lihyan where 6th century tombs are carved into the side of the mountains.

As the two princes walked to the archaeological site, another small dust storm sprang up and engulfed the entourage of the two princes briefly.

Charles, who was asked to pose for a picture, joked with photographers: 'Do you mind if I keep my sunglasses on the dust will get in my eyes.'

They then travelled on to Mada'ain Saleh, a place of pilgrimage for Muslims, that was originally built by the Nabataean people, who also created the ancient city of Petra in Jordan.

Formerly known as Hegra, it boasts well-preserved monumental tombs with decorated facades dating from the first century BC to the first century A.D. 

The site also features some 50 inscriptions dating from the pre-Nabataean period and some cave drawings which are evidence for human settlement as early as the third or second century B.C.

Charles has spent the last two days in Saudi Arabia and used his meeting with newly enthroned King Salman to raise the case of imprisoned blogger, Raif Badawi.

Mr Badawi was sentenced to 1,000 lashes for discussing political and religious freedom on the internet and 'disobeying' his father.

Today Charles will fly on to Qatar for the next stop on his government-backed tour aimed at fostering better relationships in the crucial Arabian region.
