Life-saving measures were continued by first responders who 'aggressively tried to resuscitate the children', authorities said.

Both toddlers were transferred to Broward Health Medical Center in Fort Lauderdale where they were pronounced dead.

The girls lived with their mother at an apartment close to the pool. It is unclear how they got out of the apartment and made their way to the pool or who was caring for the children at the time.

Authorities are investigating how long the girls may have been in the water before they were found.

A Broward Sheriff's Office spokeswoman said that the lock on the pool gate was broken.Â
