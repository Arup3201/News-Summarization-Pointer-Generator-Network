It is a national institution that has seen some big changes over the last few years.

In a bid to keep up with the changing times the Girl Guide movement have introduced ‘body confidence training’, scrapped the reference to God in their promise, and perhaps most controversially hired a former abortion rights campaigner as their chief executive.

Now, for only the eighth time in their hundred year history the Girl Guide uniform is also getting a major revamp.

Bright idea: Two Guides show off their new blue tops - teamed with jeans

Stylish: The two-tone zip-up polo shirts that can be worn with leggings, shorts or turquoise patterned skirt

Fashion forward: Designers who spoke with Guides were told they wanted to preserve their own style, and not look too boyish 

Out are the woggles, neck scarves and navy skirts of years gone by, replaced with two-tone zip-up polo shirts that can be worn with leggings, shorts or turquoise patterned skirt.

It is the first time the Girl Guide uniform has been updated in fourteen years and to give the range a youthful touch the organisation brought in a team of five female designers from Arts University Bournemouth.

Fashion students Kate Facer, Jessica Gray, Megan Wright, Hattie Lines and Georgia Lightwood spent a year speaking to groups of current Guides aged 10-14 about what they wanted to wear.

The conclusion was a focus on comfort and flexibility but also to preserve their own style and not look ‘too boyish.’

It’s been almost fifteen years since the decision was taken to allow girl guides to wear jeans – so long as they were blue- as part of their uniform and this latest remodel sees a further move towards a much more casual style.

Girls now have a choice of long and short-sleeved tops to wear with trousers, leggings, skirts, jeans and shorts as well as a uniform dress and skirt.

The utilitarian designs come in sky blue with bright red cuffs and sleeves and girls can choose how to mix and match their uniform - a far cry from the strict uniform standards of previous generations.

From today the polo shirt, £12.50, and hoodie, £20, will be available for the first time with the rest of the range due to be released in October.

Chief Guide, Gill Slocombe said: ‘We’re exceptionally proud of the young women who have taken such care over this project. We are thrilled with the designs - they’re fresh, young and versatile.’

Revamp: A major change came in 1990 when Jeff Banks launched the first attempt at modernising the uniform including for the first time polo shirts, sweatshirts, jogging bottoms and t-shirts

Changing tastes: In 1998 this more casual approach was confirmed with the introduction of blue jeans and again in 2000 when fashion designer Ally Capellino added a rugby shirt and body-warmer to the range

The Girl Guides were founded in 1910 as the answer for girls to the rapidly-growing Boy Scout movement.

Girls were keen to join on the activities already enjoyed by their brothers but Scouts founder Robert Baden-Powel disapproved of mixing the sexes so his sister Agnes helped set up a girl’s equivalent called the Guides.

At the start of the movement uniforms were mostly homemade and often brown like the uniforms of the Scouts’ but varied hugely depending on what was available - many were in fact uniforms outgrown by the early Guide’s brothers which they customised to fit them.

By the 1920s a uniform of navy dresses or a navy blouse and skirt had emerged, worn with a scarf folded into a tie and broad-brimmed hat had emerged and these began to be embellished with badges.

Over the next few decades the uniform remained largely unchanged although skirts shortened to knee length and the navy was replaced with a brighter blue.

The next major change came in 1990 when Jeff Banks launched the first attempt at modernising the uniform including for the first time polo shirts, sweatshirts, jogging bottoms and t-shirts.

In 1998 this more casual approach was confirmed with the introduction of blue jeans and again in 2000 when fashion designer Ally Capellino added a rugby shirt and body-warmer to the range.
