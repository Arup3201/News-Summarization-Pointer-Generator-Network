Olivier Giroud has attempted to clear up the situation regarding his personal life by insisting he has not committed adultery.

The Arsenal striker apologised after a picture taken of him by model Celia Kay appeared in a national newspaper. He took the pin-up to the Four Seasons Hotel in Canary Wharf the night before the 2-0 victory over Crystal Palace on February 2.

But Giroud said via his Twitter account: 'Ultimate precision with respect to my apologies...Yes I made a mistake but not I have not committed adultery! Things are clear...'

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger 
confirmed that disciplinary action would be taken against Giroud.

Wenger said: ‘It is an internal matter but I do not want to comment publicly because I respect his privacy.’

Giroud took to social networking site Twitter to apologise to Jennifer - who has a daughter named Jade - and his club.

‘I apologise to my wife, family and friends and my manager, team-mates and Arsenal fans,’ he said.

‘I now have to fight for my family and for my club and obtain their forgiveness. Nothing else matters at the moment.’

Warm up: The meeting took place just hours before Arsenal's 2-0 win over Crystal Palace

Kay, who models for international magazines such as Maxim and FHM, was pictured arriving at the Four Seasons hotel in Canary Wharf at 12.50am and leaving at 3.04am that night.

She insists she did not have sex with the 6ft 4in striker, who avoided a club fine when claims were made by Kay last week, insisting to Wenger that no meeting had taken place.

‘Olivier knows the truth and the fact that he lied about us is pathetic,’ Kay told the Sun on Sunday.

Revelations: Kay revealed her meeting with Giroud but the striker denied any wrongdoing

‘He’s just digging a bigger hole for himself. If he is big enough to do the crime, he’s got to serve the time.’

The Gunners planned to fine the star up to £230,000 but backed off after his denial. His lawyers also sent a series of letters to the newspaper denying any wrongdoing.

Giroud came on as a second half substitute for Arsenal on Sunday and will face Roberto Martinez’s side on the weekend of March 8.
