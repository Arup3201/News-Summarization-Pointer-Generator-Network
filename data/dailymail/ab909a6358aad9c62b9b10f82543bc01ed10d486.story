She is famed for her svelte and toned physique and is never afraid to step out in a figure-hugging dress.

But it has been revealed that Gwyneth Paltrow wasn't always so perfect. When she sought help for her hang-ups after having her babies, the 40-year-old A-lister called on Tracy Anderson - author and multi-platform wellness entrepreneur whose clients also include Madonna and Shakira - to whip her into shape.

The celebrity trainer has revealed that Gwyneth once had a 'long butt' and 'outer thigh problems' before she worked her magic on her.

Speaking to Intothegloss.com, Tracey said: 'I agreed to meet with Gwyneth, and she said, "I’ve got this movie coming up where I have to be a superhero." It was the very first Iron Man.

'She said, "I know you have a son - I just had Moses - and I can’t get this weight off. I’ve never had a problem like this in my life."

'She had 35 extra pounds on her. Her butt was long and she had outer thigh problems. Gwyneth is lucky because she’s really tall, so she can hide it really well in clothes, but she had significant problem areas.'

Tracey, 38, said that she felt really badly for Gwyneth and knew that she could really help her.

The former dancer and savvy Gwyneth are 
now business partners. Together they've produced four exercise DVDs -  
each of which has sold in excess of 20,000 copies in Britain alone -  
and a book, Tracy Anderson's 30-Day Method.

In a recent piece she wrote for The Telegraph, Gwyneth revealed that working with Tracy has completely changed her body.

She said: 'Still, when I first started working with Tracy, finding 
motivation was hard. She advised me to think of exercise as an automatic
routine, no different from brushing your teeth, to avoid getting 
distracted. Now it is part of my life.'

The blonde mother-of-two explains 
how important routine is and that she exercises Monday to Friday at 10am
and always sticks with it.

Healthy: In terms of her diet, Gwyneth - who famously follows a super healthy macrobiotic diet - says that scheduling in a detox is very important

She
advises people to create muscle tone and boost their metabolism by 
moving more and says we sit around for too much of the day.

In
terms of her diet, Gwyneth - who famously follows a super healthy 
macrobiotic diet - says that scheduling in a detox is very important.

After a
gruelling schedule and lapse of overindulgence two years ago, Gwyneth was 
left feeling fatigued and faint and a trip to the doctor later revealed 
that she was anaemic, vitamin D deficient, and that her stress levels 
were sky high.

Her doctor prescribed an elimination 
diet banning coffee, alcohol, sugar, eggs, wheat, meat and processed 
food to clear out her system and help her body heal - and she thinks everyone else should get on board.

She did, however, warn of the dangers: 'I've done juice cleanses in the past, and in my twenties I did the Master Cleanse, which left me hallucinating after 10 days.

'Be aware: a juice detox can crash your metabolism and lead to future weight gain.'

Although she maintains that following
a healthy, balanced diet is key, she admits you should always allow 
yourself programmed treats.

'I often have a glass of red 
wine in the evening and smoke a cigarette on a Saturday. I love those 
moments because they are just the right amount of naughty.

'That balance 
keeps you vibrant. You have to live your life, after all,' she added.
