Suspect: Police say Joseph M. Rivera, pictured, sexually assaulted scores of women without their knowledge over a number of years

A Virginia DJ has been arrested after videos showing him raping unconscious women were found at his apartment.

Police say Joseph M. Rivera sexually assaulted scores of women without their knowledge over a number of years.

The 34-year-old was taken into custody in Las Vegas this week and has been charged with rape, aggravated sexual battery and animate sexual object penetration as well as two counts of unlawful filming.

One of the victim's families reported their loved one had been assaulted in May, sparking a joint investigation by Fairfax County and Alexandria police.

'All the victims appeared unconscious and to this day are unaware of the videos and photographs,' Detective Brian J. Byerson wrote in a search warrant filed in Fairfax County Circuit Court on May 13.

Some of the incriminating videos were filmed in a home Rivera lived in on Station House Court in Lorton, The Washington Post reported. They were stored on a range of electronic devices, according to the search warrant.

Rivera confessed to taking photographs and filming the assaults during an interview with police. He said the videos were created between November 2011 and December 2012.

Police have identified some of the women featured in the tapes though the identities of others who appear in the video are not known.

Apartment: Some of the assaults are believed to have taken place at this apartment block in Alexandria, Virginia, where Rivera last lived

Jail: Rivera is being held in a Las Vegas prison before he is transferred to Fairfax County, Virginia

Those who police have interviewed said they were unaware of the assault and never gave permission to engage in sexual acts with Rivera.

Rivera worked as a party disc jockey - a job that saw him come into contact with numerous women.

He also hosted bar-tending competitions. It's unclear how the women became unconscious though the possibility that they were drugged is being investigated. Police believe Rivera acted alone in the filming and assaults.

He is being held in Las Vegas pending extradition to Fairfax County.
