Swansea centre back Jordi Amat has been ruled out for six weeks after suffering knee ligament damage.

The Spaniard sustained the injury during the 4-2 defeat to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Saturday and was replaced at half-time by Argentina defender Federico Fernandez.

Amat underwent a scan on Sunday and saw a consultant the following day, with the results confirming a strained lateral ligament that will rule him out until the end of October.

The 22-year-old has started all four of Swansea's  Premier League matches to date but his injury will now allow Fernandez to establish a central defensive partnership with captain Ashley Williams.

Fernandez, who played four times for Argentina at the 2014 World Cup, has only made one start for Swansea since his £8million move from Napoli last month - the Capital One cup home victory over Rotherham.
