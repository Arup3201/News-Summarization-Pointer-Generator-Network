When you're spending long hours at sea on a trawler ship, you have to get creative to keep yourself entertained.

At least that's what the crew of The Caledonia believe, keeping their spirits up by making spoof pop videos.

The crazy Scots, who spend their days trawling for prawns, even go as far as stripping off in the freezing weather to create their YouTube videos.

Deckhand Frank has proved the most popular of the fishermen on YouTube for his spoof of the Miley Cyrus video Wrecking Ball

The team have recently diversified into parody news and weather broadcasts - complete with a tame seagull

The most popular 'music video' produced so far shows deckhand Frank Ronald starkers on a red buoy pretending to be Miley Cyrus in Wrecking Ball.

In another a fellow fisherman dons seaweed for dreadlocks and an enormous chain to pose as a rapper.

The team have recently diversified into parody news and weather broadcasts - complete with a tame seagull.

The boat is based at Tarbert, Loch Fyne, which is world famous for its seafood.

As well as the Miley Cyrus parody the team have produced their version of the the Avril Lavigne song Sk8er Boi, called Skaterprawn 

A rap spoof created by the crew also involves them wearing seaweed dreadlocks and giant boat chains around their necks

Frank said: 'We can be away on the boat all week, but we could be landing our catch every couple of days.

'It's just for a bit of nonsense out in the boat, it's a bit of a laugh when it's quiet out on the deck. There's not much on at this time of year.'

As well as the Miley Cyrus parody the team have produced their version of the the Avril Lavigne song Sk8er Boi. Called Skaterprawn, it features live prawns and fishermen skateboarding along deck wearing nothing but boxer shorts.

And a painstakingly choreographed dance to recent smash hit pop song 'Timber', by US artist Pitbull featuring K$ha, shows the lads dancing on the roof of the cabin with no land in sight.

The crew of five are often out at sea for days at a time, and work long hours fishing for prawns, so keep themselves entertained with videos

Most of the videos feature one or all of the crew in their underwear. Frank said: 'Being in your pants is the best way to report the weather. Us guys have a built-in thermometer.'

Frank, who has lived in Tarbert all of his life, posts the videos on YouTube.

His version of 'Wrecking Ball' has attracted 19,364 views. 

Frank said his family are amused by his antics, although he said: 'Obviously they were a bit embarrassed. When they saw that they said they would prefer it if it wasn't me.'

Frank defies the cold sea chill to don a racy leopard-print outfit to keep his colleagues humorously entertained

He has worked as a fisherman since he left school aged 16 and insists safety remain a priority for the crew.

He said: 'You make sure it's all safe. You are still out at sea and you can't do too much nonsense. We can be out in some rough weather. You all need to pull together.'

He recently decided to focus on parody news and weather reports, with several bulletins from the boat uploaded in the last week.

Frank and fellow deckhand Bill Macfarlane, 42, use a pile of empty fish boxes as a news desk and a wooden spoon for a microphone.

Prawn baskets serve as drums in a remake of Avril Lavigne's 2002 hit Sk8er boi,; their aptly-titled version is called 'Skaterprawn'

A Caledonia news reporter Bill Macfarlane makes sure those at home are kept up to date on recent events in the trawler

A tame seagull has interrupted several of the videos by sitting on the boxes and flapping its wings.

One report features crew members pretending to be sheep, and another shows a fisherman in yellow oilskins jumping out from under a pile of empty boxes.

Frank, who edits the films once safely back on dry land, said: 'It's a lot easier to do the news than music videos. There's a lot more editing with a music video.

'It's all off the cuff. It's not rehearsed or anything. We'll probably keep on with the news for a wee while.'
