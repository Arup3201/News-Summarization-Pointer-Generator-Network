Some Seattle fans will get a 'super bowl' one way or the other no matter what happens at Sunday's championship.

Washington company Solstice says they're rolling 12,000 joints for a special Superbowl promotion for fans ready to watch the Seahawks take on the New England Patriots. 

The special, called the '12th Pack' promotion, will require the company to put out 180 to 220 joints per eight-hour shifts.

Still, 'It's not like I go home with cramps or anything,' worker Katy Filippone told NBC. 

The promotion is only available to medical marijuana users. 

The name riffs on the term the 12th man, a nickname for the Sehawk's football fans. 

The joints will also feature a special 'Seahawks Blend.'

It's hardly the first football related pot promotion in town.

Last year's season a company called Green Umbrella sold a strain honoring running back Marshawn Lynch called 'Beast Mode O.G.'

That company is selling a new strain this year, Beast Mode 2.0.
