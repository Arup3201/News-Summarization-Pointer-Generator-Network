A former 83-bedroom hotel that was once the pride of a Welsh seaside town is going under the hammer at a knockdown price of just £250,000.

Featured in the BBC/S4C drama Hinterland, the seafront Grade II listed building in Aberystwyth began life as the Queen's Hotel in 1866 and served more recently as council offices, a magistrates' court and a police station.

Boasting a large entrance hall with a Gothic staircase, the building - called Swyddfa'r Sir - has three storeys and a basement.

The ground-floor windows have quartz and ore panels beneath them, there is an abundance of extravagant stained-glass on the mezzanine, and  original ceramic sinks and brass taps in the ground floor toilets.

The building extends over 41,980 sq ft, and has been on the market for 18 months with an asking price of £1million.

But because there have been no takers the building is now going to auction in London on September 18 with auctioneers Allsop with an asking price of £250,000 - the average price of a three-bedroom house in the area.

Chris Mackenzie-Grieve, the chair of Aberystwyth Chamber of Commerce, is one of many who have questioned the guide price.

'This is an incredibly low price for a building of that size and location. I think the council was originally going for £1m, so this will be an absolute bargain,' he said.

'Having said that it will depend on the planning restrictions placed on it and how much would need to be spent to develop it.

'For a prime seafront property it has to be a bargain if sold for that amount. Let's hope they have advertised it and canvassed it widely in order to attract enough bidders.'

The building has been empty since the council opened its new office five years ago at Parc y Llyn and the magistrates' court was moved to the marina.

The council had previously said it would be prepared to sell the yard and the buildings at the site, which in the past were used by Craft, to any purchaser of Swyddfa'r Sir, suggesting it could be used for parking.

Aberystwyth mayor Brenda Haines says she is keen that the iconic building be put to use for the long-term benefit of Aberystwyth.

'Obviously the sellers have taken into consideration the current market, and the price reflects this,' she says.

'I appreciate that a lot of money will have to be spent bringing this building up to the standards that comply with current legislation, whatever the use.'

For an extra £450,000 the successful purchaser can also buy the former police yard on Queens Road potentially to use as a car park.

Aberystwyth councillor Ceredig Davies said it was important the building was brought back into use.

'Agents have failed to find a buyer for this iconic and historic property which could potentially now be bought for the price of a domestic house,' he said.

'It's a lot of building for a quarter of a million pounds and it will be disappointing if it does not realise more than this at auction.

'What the buyer will also have is the substantial costs involved in adapting or converting 'the Queens' into something that is commercially viable.

'Whilst hoping for the best price possible, my wish would be that the building will come back into use whilst retaining as much as possible of its character and original features."

Councillor Mark Strong said, 'In a prime position as it is, at the heart of Aberystwyth's seafront, it is a tremendous building.

'I only wish the local authority was not placed in the situation where it has to sell it as there is not the money to develop it ourselves. That is the real pity.'
