On Friday, Susie Wolff will become the first driver to participate in a Formula One grand prix weekend in over two decades, and Claire Williams believes it as a 'massive step forward' for the sport. 

Wolff, the 31-year-old development driver at Williams, will take part in Friday's opening practice session for the British Grand Prix - the 50th edition at Silverstone -  replacing Valtteri Bottas.

'For Formula One as a whole it sends out a really powerful message,' Williams, the British team's deputy team principal, said.

'It is a massive step forward. I think Susie has proved herself to be a great role model. She has got here on merit and it will be fantastic to see what tomorrow brings for her, but also for the future of Formula One.'

It is 22 years since a female driver took to the wheel during a race weekend, while you have to go back to 1976 when Italian driver Lella Lombardi last competed in a race.  

Wolff came through the junior ranks of karting before stints in Formula Renault and German Touring Car series DTM before being snapped up by Williams in 2012. 

But her failure to win a race during her professional career, coupled with her romantic association with Williams shareholder Toto Wolff have led some to argue she is fortunate to land a seat with the British team. 

'When she was karting, she was the only girl. She stuck with it and beat a lot of boys to get her seat and she really truly deserves the seat she has got within our race team, so I am really proud of that,' Williams explains.

'I really hope it encourages more girls to take up karting and to come up through the junior ranks because Susie has shown that you can do it, and she has also demonstrated that Formula One is a non-gender bias sport. 

We are a sport that welcomes men and women to take part in a race on a Sunday afternoon and not a lot of sports can actually say that.'

Wolff will also get behind the wheel during practice for the German Grand Prix later this month, but Williams admitted there were no plans in place for the Scot to usurp regular drivers Felipe Massa and Bottas. 

'At the moment, we have two race drivers who are contracted to the team; you never say never, but that is not part of the plan today,' she said. 

'When you are a team principal, the only thing you care about when you are looking at a potential driver to put in your car is talent and that comes with speed, technical feedback, the whole package. Whether you are a boy or a girl it doesn't make a difference. No-one cares about that.'
