Once upon a time in America, a football coach offered this definition of a fan: ‘He’s a guy who spends the afternoon yelling that the quarterback’s incompetent and the wide receiver’s a jerk. Then he leaves the stadium and he can’t remember where he parked his car.’

The football managers of England would never dare voice such contemptuous sentiments. But from time to time, when vilification becomes truly vicious, their faces reveal their private thoughts.

Most football fans are decent people who are shabbily treated. They pay far too much and receive too little in return. Their views are unheeded and their comfort is largely disregarded. Yet a small but significant proportion of the football public deserves neither sympathy nor consideration. Football grounds have never appealed to delicate sensibilities, for conflict lies at the heart of the game. But in recent seasons, attitudes have become increasingly belligerent.

There is an air of abrasive entitlement. ‘We pay for our seats!’ is the cry. ‘And that allows us to say and do anything we choose’. In the real world, of course, such attitudes are properly rejected. But football inhabits a moral universe in which insults are the common currency.

Those of us who cover the game rarely mention the prevailing atmosphere, since raw malevolence is the weekly norm. But from time to time, some small eruption will not be ignored. And when such eruptions start to form a pattern, then the game may be forced to take a critical look at itself. Today, such a pattern seems to be taking shape. And the central figure of each little drama is the football manager.

Last week, Nigel Pearson of Leicester told a particularly irksome provocateur to ‘f*** off and die’. He was foolishly offensive, of course, and the Football Association charge he now faces was inevitable.

Yet the wonder is that so many of his colleagues somehow contrive to maintain their self-control in the face of dire provocation.

After a run of fine results, Alan Pardew has apparently justified his continuing employment on Tyneside but only a few months have passed since he was virtually a prisoner of the dugout, his brief excursions the signal for all manner of screeching derision.

After his last, successful season, Brendan Rodgers has so far been spared a similar fate but if Liverpool lose at Old Trafford this lunchtime, the manager may face unhappy consequences when Arsenal visit Anfield next weekend.

Which brings us to Arsene Wenger. By the depressing standards of Stoke v Arsenal matches, last weekend’s affair was unexceptional. As the pantomime villain of the Potteries, Wenger was jeered from the start. When he had clearly decided to remain in his seat, he was taunted with endless choruses of ‘Arsene Wenger, he’s scared to stand up!’

But the genuine outrage was reserved for Stoke station on Arsenal’s homeward journey. After their team’s defeat, a section of the travelling support was intent on challenging their manager. The short video, posted on YouTube, has become shockingly familiar.

A bunch of jostling oafs pursue him to the train, shouting: ‘Here he is! Here he is! Wenger! Wenger! **** off!’ The c-word is spat out, the threats are despicable.

And one of the most brilliant managers that the English game has known, a man whose talents built a stadium, whose club have qualified for the Champions League on 17 consecutive occasions and who, just last spring, won the FA Cup, is obliged to stride past his knuckle-dragging tormentors with face white and strained. It was deeply humiliating, yet it was the consequence of a climate in which the mob may choose a managerial victim and hound him without logic or mercy. The radio phone-in, that parliament of fools, prattled: ‘He’s not up to the job ... past his sell-by date ... I’m sorry but he’s got to go.’ In an earlier age the callers might have been reaching for the black cap.

So-called ‘social media’ was equally predictable in the choice of cliche: ‘Tactically naive ... lost the plot.’ Wenger’s replacement was loosely discussed.

The 65-year-old was tormented by a flurry of strong verbal abuse by some travelling supporters  

At one stage, the popular solution was Jurgen Klopp of Borussia Dortmund. Then somebody noticed that Klopp’s club were near the foot of the Bundesliga, so the trail went conveniently cold. The hunt for a plausible candidate goes on.

Now major football managers are lavishly rewarded. Most of them enjoy the financial security of a long-term contract, which may be a factor in their increasing longevity.

Not a single Premier League manager has been sacked this season, the first time in 18 years that the League has reached mid-December without a casualty. At last, the clubs are accepting that patience is indeed a virtue.

Sadly, that enlightened attitude is not reflected in the conduct of their crowds. Yet, week after week, club owners sit in cushioned comfort high in the grandstand; rugs upon their knees, chums at their elbows.

And somehow they never hear the threats, the menace, the choreographed ugliness belching out from that same, small, loutish section of their following. But the poor manager hears, all too clearly, since much of the malice is directed at him. And no matter how he affects to ignore it, the relentless jibes take their toll.

The more thoughtful members of his profession are aware that a crisis is taking shape. Not in the manner of three decades past, with hazardous terraces and grounds which were tragedies waiting to happen but in a more insidious fashion. Hostility is flourishing unchecked, civility is perceived as weakness and something akin to hatred is being sown in fertile soil. There is a sense that the national game is drifting towards a dangerous acceptance of the unacceptable.

The urgent need is for deeper thinking, more incisive analysis and credible long-term solutions. Distinguished managers, the likes of Arsene Wenger, could make valuable contributions to that debate. It is surely time that football sought their advice.

THE PERILS OF POVERTY AT RANGERS

The decline of Glasgow Rangers continues at saddening pace.

Beaten by Queen of the South on Friday and hopelessly adrift in their efforts to win promotion from Scotland’s second tier, they have just received the resignation of their manager Ally McCoist. Unfortunately, they cannot afford to pay up McCoist’s one-year rolling contract.

How recently it seems since apparently sane people were arguing that the future of Rangers lay in the English Premier League.

In these straitened times, poor Rangers might struggle to pay the fare down from Glasgow.

In the next television football rights deal, the Premier League is to introduce up to 10 live matches a season on Friday nights. Games in this coveted slot could be worth as much as £10million each. 

We must assume that none of these fixtures will include, say, Hull v Southampton (return journey 508 miles), Palace v Sunderland (578 miles) or Swansea v Newcastle (708 miles). 

Otherwise, we might conclude that the game has finally sold itself lock, stock and barrel to the television companies. And turned its back on the travelling, ticket-buying supporters who have been its most faithful followers these past 100 years.
