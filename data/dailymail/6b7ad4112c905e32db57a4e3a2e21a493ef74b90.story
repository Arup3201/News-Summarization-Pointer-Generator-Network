Thomas Jason Fortenberry worked as a youth pastor for the Greater Harvest Community Church in Pasadena, Texas

A youth pastor has been accused of using a hidden video camera to film four naked, honey-covered girls showering.

Thomas Fortenberry had organised a ‘Fear Factor’ reality-style contest for the girls which saw him drizzle them in the sticky substance. The girls, two of whom were 15 and two were 17, were then told to wash the honey off their bodies – during which they were allegedly filmed by a camera Fortenberry had hidden in the bathroom at the Greater Harvest Community Church in Pasadena, Texas.The matter only came to light after Fortenberry, then 26, began a relationship with one of the girls and confessed to her after they became engaged, The Smoking Gun reported. When questioned by police, Fortenberry did not deny filming the teenagers, the website claims. ‘The defendant would only say that he has done things that he should not have done.’Today Texas prosecutors announced they could not pursue charges against Fortenberry since the incident occurred more than three years ago in 2007, making it beyond the statute of limitations for an improper photography/ visual recording count. Felony complaints, which were filed against Fortenberry earlier this week, were today dismissed by the Harris County District Attorney’s Office.
