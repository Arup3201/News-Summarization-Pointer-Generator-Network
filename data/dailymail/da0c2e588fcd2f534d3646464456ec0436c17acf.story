An Florida high school teacher was arrested on a DUI charge for the second time in a year as she drove to work on Monday morning.

Nancy Vaughn who is the reading teacher at Estero High School in Naples, was three times over the legal drink drive limit according to a Lee County Sheriff’s Office arrest report.

Deputies said Vaughn, 57, of Bonita Springs, was swerving across lanes at 20 mph about a mile from Estero High School, when a Florida deputy stopped her at about 7 a.m.

Bad teacher: A Florida teacher was arrested Monday morning charged with driving under the influence. 56-year-old Estero High School reading teacher Nancy Vaughn was taken into custody

She told cops she hadn’t consumed alcohol or taken any prescription drugs. Vaughan said she believed she had been driving at 45 mph as she made her way to work.

She continued for about a half-mile after a deputy flashed their lights, commanding her to pull over.

Once out of her car, Vaughn told the deputy she was driving to work at about 45 mph, denying she was under the influence of alcohol or prescription drugs.

Lee County sheriff’s deputies were alerted to Vaughn at about 6:50 a.m. Monday, 10 minutes before Estero High School’s first bell,

Estero High School : Nancy Vaughn, was pulled over by deputies less than a mile from the school. She was charged with DUI. The district removed her from the classroom pending the outcome of the investigation

Vaughn will be now placed on administrative assignment, which means she will be placed outside of school, pending an internal investigation.

Vaughn has been in jail for the past couple of days because she was already on probation relating to a May 2013 DUI to which she pleaded no contest.

She was given a years probation and also had her license revoked, however she was allowed to drive to and from work.

Teachers have to notify the district within 48 hours if there's an incident involving a substance. Discipline is then determined on a case by case basis, Chandler said, adding there was no disciplinary action against Vaughn for the previous incident

Students spoken to by FOX 4 News can't believe one of their own teachers is accused of driving to school drunk .

'There are some kids that are already going down that path and it doesn't look good and it doesn't help knowing that teachers are doing it too,' Vaughn's former student, Chris Argiro, said.

Hard habit to break: This is the second time within in ayear year Nancy Vaughn has been pulled over for DUI

'It is pretty scary, you're in class and you don't really know if she's been drunk. When I had her she might have been drunk while teaching me.'

'It sets a really bad example for the kids and people look up to their teachers and it makes the school look bad,' student Julia Brancato said.

Vaughn's former students said they don't know if she should be trusted to teach.

In the May 2013 arrest, deputies were called to Vaughn's home when a resident noticed her car up on a curb as she tried to pass through a gate.

She drove home swerving and driving slowly along the road, ignoring the flashing lights on a deputy's vehicle.

In the driveway, Vaughn rambled incoherently and told a deputy she 'partied a little too hard' on the last day of school, the report said.

'She then began to cry and say that she knew that she had drank too much and knew that she should not have been driving,' a sheriff's deputy wrote in his report.

'Vaughn continued by trying to justify that she had not hurt anyone and that she had made it to her driveway.'
