A primary school has apologised to parents after terrified children as young as six were shown a horror film as a Halloween 'treat'.

Parents said pupils were left crying and unable to sleep after watching Paul Berry-directed film The Sandman as part of a project.

The nine-minute film features a demonic creature who throws sand into the faces of sleeping children to remove their eyes and feed them to its offspring.

Kintore Primary School in Aberdeenshire has apologised to parents after children as young as six were shown The Sandman

Kintore Primary School in 
Aberdeenshire said it had no choice but to apologise following a barrage
of complaints from angry parents.

One mother said her daughter was 'very upset' and claimed her husband had to sleep in the child’s bed that night to comfort her.

She said: 'She just keeps saying she’s scared and doesn’t want to talk about it.'

Another parent added: 'Our son has 
never really been scared much of anything really, but he’s been 
genuinely upset all day and scared to go to sleep.

'He is in no way a cry-baby. I would 
be the first one to say "get over it son - it’s just a stupid movie", 
but this is not what I send him to school for.'

One girl at the school was so badly affected that she believed there was sand in her bed.

Terrifying: The film was shown to a group of six and seven-year-old children at the Scottish school

The animated video clip on YouTube 
has attracted a number of comments from users disturbed by the content 
and questioning its suitability for children.

One viewer said: 
'OMG!! Was this actully [sic] made for kids?! The Sandman himself looks 
so freaky. It looks like something﻿ that just came out of your 
nightmares.'
Another added: 'Wow... I watched this thinking it was dumb and stupid but it's actually quite freaky.'

Meanwhile, another viewer questioned the decision by other schools to show the film.

She said: 'Has the British Education 
system﻿ gone completely mad setting this as a lesson project?!! 'Kids 
have got quite enough in life to give them nightmares without this!'

As the child sleeps, the evil creature approaches her bed before taking the eyes to feed to its offspring

Kintore Primary School has now apologised to the parents of children who were 'treated' to the film

Kintore Primary School has now written 
to the parents of the 24 pupils who watched the film and apologised for 
the 'error of judgement'.

A spokesman for Aberdeenshire Council said: 'While this Oscar-nominated short animated film is recognised as an educational resource, we do not believe it was entirely suitable for some of the children who watched it.

'A small section at the start of the film was used to stimulate a writing project, but the teacher agreed when children asked her to let them watch the rest, as they had enjoyed the small clip.

'The school has written to the parents of the 24 or so pupils who watched it, apologising for the error of judgement and for any upset it caused.'
