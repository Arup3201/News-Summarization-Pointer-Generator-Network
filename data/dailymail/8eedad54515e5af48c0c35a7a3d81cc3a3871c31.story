When the republican revolutionaries set up their barricades in Paris in 1832, they had a lot more on their mind than setting off a smoke alarm.

But as the cast of Les Miserables started to recreate the scenes at a world-famous London theatre this afternoon, the building's electrical equipment had other ideas.

Some 1,200 people had to be evacuated from the Queen's Theatre in Shaftesbury Avenue, 17 minutes into today's matinee performance of the West End show.

The cast of Les Miserables were seen milling about the streets of London this afternoon after the matinee performance of the West End show was evacuated after 17 minutes 

The cast, dressed in full 19th Century attire, were at one point even seen giving directions to passing tourists

The entire audience, as well as the cast, had to be ousted from the theatre after part of the tranformer over-heated, leading to a fire alert. 

The incident led to bizarre scenes in central London, as cast members - dressed in full 19th Century attire - milled around the Soho streets, waiting for news.

As hundreds gathered in the road outside the building, the revolutionaries were even seen handing out directions to passing tourists.

Once the drama had died down, the official Les Miserables Twitter feed posted: 'The show is back on tonight, and we haven't burnt much energy... So we're gunna be on fire!!'

Fire crews were called to the incident just before 4pm this afternoon. Everyone inside had to be evacuated from the building as a precaution. 

A spokeswoman for LFB said: 'There has been no fire but a transformer in part of the threatre has overheated. The auditorium itself has not been affected.

'Two fire engines are on standby to oversee work by the UK Power Network. Around 1,200 persons had already been evacuated as a precaution before the arrival of the crews.'  

Grace Perry tweeted: 'Half way through watching a play and the whole of Shaftesbury avenue decides to have a powercut. Brill'

She added that after being evacuated the cast, who were still in costume, were helping by 'just wondering (sic) round giving people directions'.

Audience members said on Twitter that they experienced a black out half-way through the show. 

The London production of Les Miserables is the world's longest running musical where it played 7,602 performances at the Palace Theatre before transferring to the Queen's Theatre where it opened in April 2004, according to the show's website.

This year it will celebrate its 30th anniversary in London.
