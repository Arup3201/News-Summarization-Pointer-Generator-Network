The people living on the Arctic Circle are often mysterious to the world's southerners, obscured by coverings of fur and snow.

But now the lives of  those who call the  far north home have been captured by London-based photographer Cristian Barnett. 

The photographer traveled to the eight countries along the 66 degree  33 minutes north latitude marker, taking pictures of the inhabitants for his book Life on the Line.

Cristian Barnett made more than ten trips to the Arctic Circle over eight years and met characters including Hans Bengston in Sweden, a 'master of glibness and sausage poet'

Mr Barnett met people along the 66 degree 33 minute north line that were as diverse as reindeer herders and hair dressers. Brett Connor (pictured) of Kotzebue, Alaska, has a hot tub in his living room because it is so cold outside

Artic peoples Mr Barnett met include the Gwichin, Saami, Khanti, Nenets, Evenks, Yakuts and Inuit. Above, Mike Ivaluntanar of Repulse Bay, Canada, stands on a giant whalebone

Mr Barnett visited more than 20 towns and villages over his long project. Above, Lars Anders Hakansson, a tanner, sits with his bear.

Mr Barnett said the eight-year project started when he looked at a map and was 'intrigued by the mysterious dotted line that dissected apparently vast empty spaces'.

However, after traveling making eleven trips to 23 towns and villages, he was able to meet members of Arctic peoples such as the Gwichin, Saami, Khanti, Nenets, Evenks, Yakuts and Inuit.

Much of the photography of the Arctic focuses on natural phenomena such as the Aurora Borealis, but more than 4million people live within the circle, according to Arctic.ru. 

Looking to capture the extraordinary lives of people who did not live exactly on the line, the photographer expanded his scope to include some individuals within 35 miles of the Arctic Circle. 

He encountered a man who described himself as a 'master of glibness and sausage poet' and everyone from reindeer herders to hair dressers. 

Though the expeditions to the Arctic Circle included temperatures as high as 68 degrees F, Mr Barnett also had trouble with his camera when it fell below 5 degrees

Many Arctic towns and cities rely on local rivers, though they remain frozen solid for most of the year.

And Mr Barnett managed not to be frozen  in the frigid north of the US, Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia.

Winters above the arctic circle see very little or no sunlight, while in summers the sun never sets. 

He experienced temperatures as high as 68 degrees F in Jokkmokk, Sweden, according to Slate.

The cold did cause troubles for his camera, though, which had problems working below 5 degrees. 

'It's not actually an extreme environment in a lot of cases,' he says. 'Mostly it's not that difficult of a place to live' he said.

However Mr Barnett also encountered the troubles of people often forgotten about by people in warmer, less isolated climates, such as the Inuit people in northern Canada.

The people that Mr Barnett visited in their Arctic homes were hospitable. Above, a farmer's wife takes a break from cow-milking in Knjazaja Guba, Russia

His guide and his family used to survive on subsistence hunting, but now faced joblessness and a 'crumbling prefabricated house', according to the Barents Observer.

People where Mr Barnett went were hospitable, though.

The vegetarian was offered and drank reindeer blood with the Nenets people of Siberia, he told the Arctic Journal. 

Mr Barnett and his translator were the seventh and eighth foreigners to visit Zhigansk, in northeastern Russia.

He said that far from getting a frosty reception, they were 'treated like royalty'. 

His work as been featured in several exhibitions in the UK.

The photographer said that his next project may involve taking pictures along the straight line that extends from the door of his house around the world.

'It's not actually an extreme environment in a lot of cases,' Mr Barnett said of the intimadating conditions. Above, Kristian Skifte, a master carver from Sisimiut, Greenland

While many southerners' ideas about the Arctic circle revolve around reindeer, the area has many modern settlements. Above, Maria Manninen a fashion student in Rovaniemi. Finland
