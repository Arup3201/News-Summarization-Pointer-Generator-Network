Cat lover Alexandra Blakelock, of Leeds, West Yorks, said that her cat Boris often gave her a rude awakening during the night.

The accounts worker, who is in her 20s, said: "I love Boris to bits, but he has had a huge impact on my sleep and I'll often be tired the next day because he's woken me up.

"He wakes up any time from 2am because he wants to play or go out, and will do anything from licking, biting or jumping up on top of the wardrobe in the middle of the night.

"Most nights I'm up at least once, letting him in when he stays out late or shutting him in another room so I can get back to sleep"

Another cat lover, Lucy Ellis, 31, of Eastbourne, East Sussex, said: "My cat Rosie usually wakes me up by jumping on my head around 5am.

"If I close the door she just scratches and scratches until I eventually let her in.

"I don't have to be up for work until 7am, so I'm often woken up two hours before I actually need to get up.

"The most annoying thing is when she decides to go in the litter box in the middle of the night and spends 10 minutes kicking the cat litter around the place - it drives me mad!!"

Thomas Lord, of memoryfoamwarehouse.co.uk, said: "As a nation of pet lovers we're often told that owning one can improve our general health and lifestyle.

"But with us now spending more time and money on our beloved pets, we wanted to see what sort of impact they are having on relationships, stress, and most importantly for us, sleep.

"In regards to the effects that pets have on our sleep, the fact that more than half of us lose sleep because of them is something of an eye-opener."
