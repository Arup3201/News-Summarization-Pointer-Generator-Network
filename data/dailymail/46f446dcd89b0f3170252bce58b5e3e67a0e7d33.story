President Obama groveled over the phone to a newlywed couple who had to scrap their plans for a golf course ceremony at the last minute so their Commander in Chief could tee off.

The President said he felt 'terrible' that Captains Natalie Heimel and Edward Mallue Jr were forced to move their big day because of his vacation plans at the Kaneohe Klipper Golf Course.

Obama, speaking to the couple just after their said their vows, crackled over an iPhone loudspeaker, saying he would have skipped the 16th hole if anybody had told him there was a wedding going on - and joked he would have come away with a better score, too.

'Feeling terrible': The President said he would have been willing to forgo one hole's worth of golf had he known

Wave goodbye to your plans! The newlyweds told Obama that the move was 'a blessing in disguise'

The President said: 'I feel terrible. Nobody told us. If they had just mentioned that they were going to have a wedding on the 16th hole, we would have skipped the 16th hole.'

Obama later said that this would have improved his score - an 84 - by six strokes, giving him a 79.  

The gracious couple described the move as a 'blessing in disguise' because of the better view from their new spot. They told the President how they met while posted in Germany in 2011 - then cheekily invited him to their wedding reception.

But Obama declined, saying that his inescapable security detail would be a downer at the party.

The bride and groom learned of the decision the day before their ceremony was planned to take place at the 16th tee box of the course, which has picturesque views of the Pacific Ocean.

Sorry: Army Captains Natalie Heimel and Edward Mallue Jr planned to get married at the 16th tee box of the Kaneohe Klipper Golf Course on Sunday, but had to move their ceremony at the last minute because President Obama wanted to play the course.

Ironically, the couple knew the president would be in town and sent him an invite on a whim, and received a polite decline just hours before they learned they could no longer get married at their desired location. 

'It was emotional, especially for [Heimel]—she’s the bride and in less than 24 hours they had to change everything they had planned,' the groom's sister Jamie McCarthy told Bloomberg.

The wedding instead took place on the green lawn of the Marine Corps base where the golf course is located, and many attendants posted pictures of the ceremony online with the hashtag #ThanksObama.

President Obama and his family are currently vacationing on his home state of Hawaii for the Christmas holidays, and he has played golf six times in the past nine days. 

Yesterday he took to the course with friends Mike Ramos, Greg Orme and Bobby Titcomb. 

However, it appears the president didn't know that his golf game interrupted a military wedding, since he reached out to the newlyweds to apologize. In a picture posted to Instagram, the couple were seen at the ceremony answering a call from the commander in chief.

'He apologized and congratulated them,' McCarthy said. 

'We were all there, it was perfect,' she added. 'Made their day.'

According to Naile Brennan, manager of the catering company which worked on the wedding, anyone planning a wedding at the course are warned that the president can interrupt events when he is in town.
