A 72-year-old New York woman has described for the first time how she was held prisoner in the early 1960s as a young bride in an Afghanistan harem.

In a new book, 'An American Bride in Kabul' released early next month, Phyllis Chesler writes about five months she spent in the Muslim country, and how she almost died before she managed to escape and annul her ill-fated marriage.

Chesler was 18 when she fell in love with a handsome older Afghan man who she met when the pair were studying together at Bard college. After dating for two years, Chesler told Adul-Kareem she wanted to travel but her boyfriend insisted they must be married before they could embark on their adventures.

Against her outraged parents' wishes, Chesler wed her Muslim prince at a civil ceremony in Poughkeepsie with no family present.

They traveled to Europe for their honeymoon with a plan to stop off in Kabul to meet his family.

'I did not know that this would be our final destination,' she writes in an exert of the book in The New York Post, explaining that 30 relatives awaited the newlyweds as they landed in the Afghan capital.

Among them, there was not one but three mothers-in-law, Chesler recalls. She was too shocked to speak, and wondered what this meant for her own future as a wife of an Afghan man.

The
 family was warm and inviting so she tried to forget her husband's 
starling omission -- until an airport official demanded that she turn 
over her American passport. She refused.

'Everyone
 stops. Both the official and my husband assure me that this is a mere 
formality,' she writes. 'It will soon be returned to me, so I 
reluctantly relinquish it. I will never see my passport again.'

Her lack of passport meant she would not be able to leave Afghanistan at will.

'I
 am now subject to the laws and custom of Afghanistan, and as a Afghan 
woman, that means hardly any rights at all,' she writes.

Former life: In her new book, 'An American Bride in Kabul' released early next month, Chesler, pictured left and right, writes her harrowing experience in Kabul

She was taken to her rich father-in-law's spacious compound -- where the patriarch, his three wives, 21 children - ranging from infancy to their 30s - two grandchildren, at least one son-in-law, one daughter-in-law and an unknown number of servants and relatives lived in a number of luxury two-story European-style houses, with patios, indoor gardens, and verandas.

'This is my new home. My prison. My harem,' she explains in the book.

The family went out of their way to 
impress Chesler when she arrived and the couple was welcomed with a 
feast of 'unending and delicious dishes' cooked without the traditional ghee, a clarified butter that often makes foreigners ill because their stomachs are not used to it.

Abdul-Kareem came alive during the celebration, she recalls, speaking Dari,
 which she herself could not speak, and leaving her alone with the other women.

Despite
 having never prayed at home, her husband, like all the other men, 
suddenly dropped to the floor on all fours to profess his devotion to 
Allah.

She said from that point on she was left almost constantly alone or with her biological mother-in-law and female relatives.

The special treatment quickly stopped and soon all her meals were being made
 with ghee, making her so sick she stopped eating them. She instead horded canned food but this was later 
confiscated.

She was not allowed to leave the compound without an entourage of people guarding
 her -- as such, she left just twice in her first two weeks and five 
or six times in total.

'I have no freedom at all,' she wrote in her journal at the time. 'No opportunity to meet anyone or go anywhere. His family watches me suspiciously. Am I getting paranoid?'

Her mother-in-law then stopped boiling her drinking water and she immediately contracted dysentery.

'Perhaps she thinks I am already 'Afghan enough' to withstand any and all germs. Perhaps she wants me dead,' she writes.

She explains her mother-in-law then attempted to convert her to Islam, giving her prayer rugs and prayer beads. She feared that if she didn't convert, her mother-in-law may sickened her further or even kill her.

But converting to Islam still wasn't enough. Her mother-in-law would spit at her and call her "Yahud" or "Jew" when she became angry.

When she told her husband, he said she was being dramatic.

At that point, she realized she had to escape.

She tried three times to get to the American embassy, hoping her country would protect her and help her get home. But without a US passport, she no longer had any rights as an American.

Meanwhile, Abdul-Kareem had become short-tempered.

'He has begun to hit me,' she wrote in her journal at the time. 'Had I known something like this could ever happen, had I known that we would have to live with his mother and brothers, I would never have come here.'

Her efforts to leave were scuppered when she became seriously ill.

After days of struggling with her unsympathetic family, they called a local doctor who diagnosed her with hepatitis.

She begged to see an American doctor and, though closely guarded, the doctor managed to get her alone for a moment and told her she must return to the US for treatment.

The next thing she remembered was her mother-in-law tugging at her IV line, trying to end her life, she believes.

Chesler's husband, realizing his young bride would leave him if her health improved, conspired a way to make her stay -- he climbed into her bed and forced himself on her, knowing that if she was pregnant with his child she wouldn't be allowed to leave Afghanistan.

Luckily, her health did improve and knowing this was possibly her last chance at freedom, she appealed to her father-in-law who alone had the power to return to her to America.

'He arrives and almost immediately says: "I think it will be best if you leave with our approval on an Afghan passport, which I have obtained for you. You have been granted a six-month visa for reasons of health."'

He has a passport in hand for his American daughter-in-law, who by that stage had missed two periods.

She felt a huge sense of relief at that moment but when she got back to the compound her husband was incensed at the news and hit her. She boarded the first plane out.

'When the plane takes off, I am filled with more fierce joy than my body can contain. And when I finally land on American soil, I literally kiss the ground,' she writes.

When she arrived home she suffered a miscarriage. 'My body made that decision for me,' she explains in the book.

She returned to college where she was studying literature, found a job and applied to graduate school. Two years later, she got her marriage to Abdul-Kareem annulled.

Chesler said she has shared her story, some 50 years on, to show her first-hand experience of the 'deep-seated the hatred of women' in Islam culture.

'I see how endemic indigenous barbarism and cruelty is and unlike many other intellectuals and feminists, I don't try to romanticize or rationalize it,' she writes, adding that she was lucky to escape with her life and will never return.

Chesler is a feminist scholar and a professor emerita of psychology and women's studies at City University of New York. She has changed the name of her former husband in her account.
