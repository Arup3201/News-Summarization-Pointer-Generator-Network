Yesterday we brought you what we thought were the most awkward Christmas photos of all time, but overnight, more snaps have surfaced of families grimacing in seasonal attire.  

As families start sending out their Christmas cards, many - like Tony and Cherie Blair earlier this week - will have opted for the personal touch, printing seasonal snaps featuring loved ones, children and pets.

But as the former Prime Minister and his barrister wife's annual greeting proves, festive portraits have the potential to inspire more ha ha ha's than ho ho ho.

These pictures show the cringe-inducing lengths some parents will go to produce the ultimate holiday greeting even if that means stripping off, cuddling bizarre pets, dressing in matching tartan or even donning PVC. 

One family even braved the winter chill to strip down and show off their brand new hot tub.

Resembling a snap from an office party, this family strip off for a naughty festive portrait

Bad Santas with a black eye, matching Christmas jumpers and dad naked by the dinner table, these photographs are definitely on the naughty list.

There are a few turkeys in this festive photo album as the most wonderful time of the year is captured in all its awkward glory. 

Some went even further, dropping the swimming trunks and bikinis, favouring a fig leaf - instead of mistletoe - to cover their modesty in saucy family shot.

One family attempted to pose as Santa and his reindeer but just ended up looking like a disjointed human centipede.

While others demonstrated that pets such as budgies, a duck and birds of prey and are always risky props.

Others covered up in the retro-styled Christmas jumpers that are all the rage at the moment but some of these festive frights are more suited to Halloween.

This Father Christmas appears to be dozing off as the baby on his knee looks worried 

The pole seems the ideal spot to capture that wholesome family photo (left), meanwhile one member of the family on the right has decided she's having none of it

This toddler dressed as a gingerbread man is pulling her angriest face but still looks adorable

Although even the worst woollen wear can't match one family's own tie-dye fashion disaster.

They at least took the trouble to co-ordinate their clobber.

One dad decided to ruin his relative's festive memories by secretly getting his kit off just before he said cheese.

The smile on children's faces at Christmas often makes the months of work that parents put in to finding the perfect present all worth it.

But instead their kid's terrible tantrums and tears have been turned into cherished memories in these pics.

One naughty boy was even wrapped up in Christmas lights as a punishment - Santa surely didn't visit him that year.

Even old Mr Claus himself has been risking the sack with a few creepy pictures.

Some people go all-out when it comes to dressing up, like this family of festive presents

One little girl knows how to get her own way when it comes to sharing, as proven in this family shot

These children are wondering why on earth mum and dad brought them to see Father Christmas - clearly not fans

This family ditched the Christmas sweaters and opted for just a fig leaf to cover their modesty 

St. Nicks were snapped letting beards slip, dozing after a few too many sherries and one bad Santa even boasted a black eye.

This album of awkwardness certainly proves the saying you can 'pick your friends but you can't pick your family' is true.

Nothing looks quite as uncomfortable as matching outfits, except, of course, when just one member of the family decides to just dispense with clothes altogether. 

But perhaps it's worth treasuring these photos, as next time you feel a little embarrassed about being in a family snap at Christmas, you will remember it could be a lot worse.

Something's roasting by an open fire but it's not chestnuts... A father-of-two sheds his clothes in this funny family Christmas shot

Dad, put it away! You can tell who likes to sleep naked in this family photo where all members - bar one - are wearing pyjamas 

These children are not too happy to be meeting Father Christmas. One little girl sulks while another bursts into tears

This family attempts to resemble Santa and his reindeer but proves that just because you can photoshop your snaps doesn't mean you should 

Spot the odd pet out: This dog's owners are absolutely quackers about budgies and birds - even insisting the duck look straight at the camera 

It may be true that owners and their dogs look alike - but dress the same too? It's still not clear where the doll fits in in this surreal tableau 

Who's game? Welcome to the house where children cuddle dachshunds while their mullet-haired  parents show off the family's birds of prey

Tartan army: This family captures the moment when each member is a head taller than the other - and willing to wear a red plaid nightie 

The strangest Father Christmas jumpers, left, and the most forced Christmas smiles (or grimaces), right, we've ever seen 

Forced into red onesies and wearing glasses that time and taste forgot - who can blame the children for their stony expressions?
