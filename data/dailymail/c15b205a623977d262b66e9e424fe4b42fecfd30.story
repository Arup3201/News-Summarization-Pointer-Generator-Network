Two men were arrested after police used road spikes to bring a dramatic car chase across south-east Queensland to an end.

One of the cars had a baby inside, Nine News reported - until a gunman insisted it be removed from the vehicle. 

The car had crossed the New South Wales border when the two men were arrested. A number of shots were allegedly fired at police.
