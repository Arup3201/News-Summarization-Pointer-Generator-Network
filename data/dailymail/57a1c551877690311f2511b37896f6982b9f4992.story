Willie Geist and Carson Daly underwent testicular cancer exams on national television, in front of millions of viewers Friday in an effort to raise awareness about the disease.

As part of TODAY's 'Movember' initiative -- a month-long effort to raise awareness of men's health-- Geist and Daly met with Dr. David Samadi, urology chairman at Lenox Hill in New York, and took the brief exam in a private room with live microphones, according to TODAY. 

Samadi jokingly asked the men 'who's going to play ball first?' before he examined the men for their size and texture, checking for unusual lumps in the testicles.

Millions: Willie Geist and Carson Daly underwent testicular cancer exams on national television, in front of millions of viewers Friday in an effort to raise awareness about the disease

When Geist emerged from his exam, he explained that the exam was not unpleasant, saying there was no pain or discomfort. 

Both Geist and Daly are beyond the ages most likely to develop the disease. 

The Testicular Cancer Society reports that the rare disease is the most common form of cancer in males aged 15-35. Geist is 39 and Daly is 41 years old. 

The two told TODAY that they were undergoing the exam -- which was broadcast on a billboard in Times Square -- because people are 'skittish' about going to the doctor. 

Daly himself admitted, prior to the exam, that he was nervous. 

'It’s a nerve-wracking thing because at any moment you’re afraid the doctor is going to say they’re discovering something,' Daly told TODAY.  

Both were completely healthy, TODAY reports.

Tweet: Daly said he was nervous for the exam, but tweeted afterward that he is thankful for his health

Self Exam: The exam took less than one minute to complete and Samadi encouraged men to self exam. He said men should check for firmness, lumps or bumps about once a month, usually after a warm shower when the muscles are relaxed

The exam took less than one minute to complete and Samadi encouraged men to self exam. He said men should check for firmness, lumps or bumps about once a month, usually after a warm shower when the muscles are relaxed.

Last year, Matt Lauer and Al Roker underwent the exams live on air with Samadi in an effort to raise awareness about the disease.

Samadi said that, when treated early, testicular cancer patients have a 95 percent survival rate. 

Samadi applauded the men for getting the exams and implored men everywhere to get to the doctor and to self exam. 

He also encouraged women to urge the men in their lives to get the exams saying that women play a huge role in helping men catch the disease.
