Convicted rapist Ched Evans should be allowed to play professional football again, according to Professional Footballers’ Association chief Gordon Taylor.

Taylor believes the 25-year-old should be accepted back into the game when he is released from prison despite his five-year sentence for rape in April 2012.

The PFA chief told the BBC: ‘I didn't know there was a law that said once you come out of prison you still can't do anything.

Ched Evans was found guilty of rape in 2012 and is currently serving a five-year prison sentence

Tony Adams - Was miles over the drink-drive limit when he crashed his car into a wall in 1990 and spent 57 days in prison. After release, captained Arsenal and England with distinction.

Lee Hughes - Served three years for causing death by dangerous driving in 2003. Played for Oldham and Port Vale among others following his release.

Joey Barton - Was imprisoned for 77 days in 2008 after being convicted of assault outside a McDonald's. Now playing for QPR.

Duncan Ferguson - Jailed in 1994 for headbutting an opponent on the pitch, he went on to become an Everton hero.

Jermaine Pennant - Another drink-driving conviction, the winger spent 30 days in prison then became the first Premier League player to take to the field wearing an electronic tag.

‘As a trade union we believe in the rule of law... besides that, he still wants to contribute to society.

‘If he earns money he'll pay taxes. Those taxes will go to help people who maybe can't get a job.’

Sheffield United signed Evans from Manchester City for £3million in 2009, but released him the month after his conviction for raping a 19-year-old woman at a hotel near Rhyl in north Wales.

The South Yorkshire club have refused to comment on a possible return for Evans, who was capped 13 times for Wales before his conviction.

Wales boss Chris Coleman told a media conference on Thursday: ‘I've not thought about Ched Evans. That story has come from outside our camp.

‘I'm my own man but with respect to Ched and everyone involved that's not on my mind.’

Evans has always maintained his innocence and legal representatives for the striker are preparing a submission to the Criminal Cases Review Commission aimed at quashing his conviction.
