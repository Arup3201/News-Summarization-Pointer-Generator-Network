Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers is adamant his side are not heading into the Bernabeu like lambs to the slaughter and insists their current plight is being over-exaggerated.

Having lost to Newcastle, scraped past Swansea and been held to a goalless draw at home to Hull in the last week, the last place you would want to take your team is Madrid.

The Champions League holders and Primera Division leaders dished out a lesson at Anfield two weeks ago, racing into a 3-0 half-time lead before easing off as they saved themselves for the Clasico against Barcelona, and the fear is they could run amok on home turf.

Few give the Reds a hope of getting anything out of the game, never mind repeating their famous 1-0 win here in 2009 - a masterclass in tactical discipline by former boss Rafael Benitez.

But Rodgers stressed there would be no conceding this game - even though the reality remains that their Group B future will be decided by the final two matches against Basle and Bulgarian minnows Ludogorets.

'We are certainly not coming here as a team expecting to lose and then look at the other games as games to qualify,' Rodgers said.

'For us, we see it as an opportunity. We still very much have qualification in our hands.

'It is a wonderful arena - one of the iconic football grounds in the world - and, when you come up against the best opponents, that is the challenge and what makes you perform to your best.

'They are probably the best team in the world at the moment and we really look forward to big games.

'We see them as an opportunity rather than a threat to what we are doing.

'Our defence have come under quite a bit of criticism. It is nowhere near as bad as people make out.

'What has been the frustration defensively has been the mistakes and sloppy goals we have given away.

'There haven't been too many times when the team has been outdone.

'When you have an attacking philosophy you are going to be susceptible in your defensive side because you are not sat with nine players behind the ball.

'You are looking to control and dominate the game, but we have to eradicate the errors. 

'The key, even though we know it is tough, is to make sure we are compact and disciplined in our game.

'I think we showed in the previous game, although the score was 3-0, we can still have moments when we can hurt Real Madrid and that will be the idea (on Tuesday).

'There is absolutely no question we have the courage. This is a team and a group of players who have been so brave to take on the challenge I have asked them to.'
