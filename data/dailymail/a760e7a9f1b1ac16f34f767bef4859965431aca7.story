Fitness trackers are everywhere at the moment - even Samsung added one to its Galaxy S5 phone - but while each of them have similar features, they’re nothing compared to those offered by the Moov device.

Moov is an all-in-one fitness tracker and personal trainer that fits in the palm of a hand and can be clipped onto anything from trainers, bikes, weights, golf clubs and more.

When connected to a phone, Moov monitors running and cycling style, swimming strokes, yoga poses, tennis and golf swings and then gives spoken, tailored advice and motivation to improve the wearer's technique.

The technology behind Moov was 
developed with support from sport scientists and biomechanics at Harvard
 University and University of Cape Town.

It
 is fitted with sensors, including accelerometer and a gyroscope, that 
can sense and track movement and the range of movement.

It
 can also measure shocks caused by impact when running for example, and 
its waterproof meaning it can be worn while swimming. 

A
 voice coach, which sounds a little like Apple's Siri, will give real-time 
feedback, motivation and advice to improve the wearer’s exercise 
routine.

For example, when running the personal trainer can tell the wearer to take shorter strides and land softer.

The fitness disc uses sensors to track impact, weight, range, steps and other movement related to a variety of sports and exercises.

It was designed by former Apple engineer Nikola Hu, Meng Li, and Tony Yuan who describe the device as the ‘second generation of wearables.'

‘Moov is uniquely positioned among the current wearable fitness solutions,’ said the trio.

‘While tracking your step counts, calories and sleep patterns are essential basic data, we believe Moov’s exact motion sensing technology, virtual coach powered by AI and the interactive gaming elements will truly bring your fitness and workout experience to a whole new level.’

The Moov fitness disc connects wirelessly to smartphones and tablets and comes with a band that can be fitted around a wrist or ankle. It uses sensors to track impact, weight, range, steps and other movements related to a variety of sports and exercises

The Moov disc can be fitted to any exercise equipment including weights, pictured left, and a bike frame, pictured right. Moov will launch with running, cycling, swimming, cardio boxing and weight training sections. Yoga, golf and tennis sections will be added in future releases

The Moov disc is also waterproof so it can be used while swimming and a connected smartphone app, pictured, can record lengths, strokes and time

During yoga, Moov can tell the wearer to straighten their arms or back, or give tips on breathing. And when playing golf, the disc can advise on posture and follow through methods.

Moov wirelessly connects to a smartphone app which stores all the workout data, and can offer visual tips and advice. This data can then be shared with friends or competitors.

Hu, Li and Yuan have set up a crowdfunding campaign on the product site to raise $40,000 (£23,900) before the end of March. The product is set to go on sale in the summer.

A single Moov will cost $120 (£77), while a pair costs $200 (£119). After that extra Moovs can be bought for $49.95 (£29).

People who pre-order a Moov get 50 per cent off the retail price - $59.95 (£35) for a single, and $99.95 (£59) for a pair.

Each pack includes a Moov, a charger, a wrist band and an ankle band. Customers can choose their preferred colour once the campaign ends.

Moov will launch with running, cycling, swimming, cardio boxing and weight training sections. Yoga, golf and tennis will be added in future releases.

The company also plans to let developers use the disc to create their own unique smart features, such as turning a wrist to switch on a light.
