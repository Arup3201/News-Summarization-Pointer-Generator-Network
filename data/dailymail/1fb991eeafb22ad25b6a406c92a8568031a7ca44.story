A stunning visualization from a University of Chicago master's student shows how the middle class have been pushed almost completely out of the Windy City in only a few decades.

Daniel Kay Hertz has created a series of maps dating back to 1970 show the rapidly expanding upper class on the traditionally well-off North Side and the explosion of poverty on historically poorer South Side.

The public policy major said the maps posted to his personal website are meant to show that the entrenchment of wealth in the Loop and on the North Side, and of poverty elsewhere, may only be part of a cycle that has seen neighborhoods change radically in only a few years.

SCROLL DOWN FOR ANIMATION

What once was: Chicago's wealth was mainly confined to the North Side and far northern outskirts in the 1970s, and a large middle class lived throughout the city - but poverty begins to take hold as the 1980s wear on

Rising gap: The growth in the 1990s of wealth was matched by a rise in 
poverty, but larger amounts of wealth started concentrating in Lakeview 
(dark green) while the rest of the city began to struggle

As it is today: Staggering amounts of wealth exist on the North Side and
 shocking poverty persists to the south and west of the neighborhoods in
 green

The maps are ‘not merely to depress you (you’re welcome!), but to suggest just how dramatically the reality of Chicago’s ‘two cities’ has changed over the last few generations, how non-eternal its present state is, and that a happier alternate reality isn’t just possible, but actually existed relatively recently,’ said Hertz.

They are based on census tracts and use historical data compiled from a variety of sources, Hertz disclosed on the blog spot.

Green, representing wealth, was always present in the Lakeview neighborhood stretching from the Lake Shore to a few blocks west of Wrigley Field.

As the decades wear on, less prosperous residents are seen pushed out of the North Side, slowly at first, but then further and further west until they are barely part of the city.

Chicago’s reputation as a violent city comes without qualification, but that violence is nowhere to be seen from Wrigleyville, the neighborhood surrounding the iconic Cubs ballpark, all the way to the downtown area referred to as The Loop.

Recent developments including Millenium Park and countless condo buildings in the area have turned The Loop from the ghost town it was after office hours to the vibrant upper-class neighborhood it is now.

Green, which at its darkest shade represents incomes at 200% or higher than the metro median, stretches further and further west from Lake Michigan into even the West Loop, which has recently undergone explosive growth as warehouses have been converted to loft apartments.

Hertz refers to this as ‘the ever-widening ghetto of the affluent’ and says that ‘radically exclusionary housing laws’ have made it possible.

The rest of the map shows a virtual explosion of poverty, especially on the South Side.

The area’s incomes were either just below, above or at the median for the city as recently as 1970, but poverty begins to take hold in the 1980s and only tightens its grip as the decades wear on.

Pale shades of orange representing struggling families give way to blocks of red paint a picture of shocking despair.

Thriving: Chicago's North Side, especially the area around Wrigley Field, has always been a relatively prosperous neighborhood, but recent decades have seen that prosperity explode

What was once a working-class neighborhood has turned into drug-addled, crime ridden slums that rank among the most dangerous in the nation and have been dramatized in the Showtime series ‘Shameless.’

There are exceptions to each, pockets of relative prosperity, but the overall trend is downward as most middle class families are pushed further and further out into the suburbs and impoverished ones are hopelessly marooned in less prosperous areas.

Going west from the lake is no better.

A short 20 minute drive from the bankers and academics on the North Side and in The Loop, especially along West Madison and West Grand Avenues, transitions from industrial areas to poor, lower class households.

The area west of Garfield Park has not fared well, nor have the other neighborhoods immediately along the Eisenhower Expressway, a main East-West artery just to the south.

‘The obvious and immediate reaction to these maps is to see them as a direct consequence of rising income inequality,’ wrote Hertz, but he thinks something else is at play.

‘Income segregation has actually risen faster than inequality,’ he believes, or, in other words, purchasing power from working class incomes has continued to fall as the upper class increasingly continues to prosper.

The solution, as Hertz sees it, is through housing laws aimed at bringing down the barriers to migration that have gone up over the years.
