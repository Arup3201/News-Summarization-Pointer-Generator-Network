The driver of a lorry
that crashed into the back of a stationary bus carrying a party of 
fruit-packers on the M5 was named today.

William
Mapstone, 65, from Wells in Somerset, died shortly after 9pm on

The bus passenger has also been named as father-of-three Liaquat Ali, 35, from Smethwick, West Mids.

Mr Ali was confirmed dead at the scene
of the crash, which happened in the early hours of Saturday when the 
lorry collided with the single-decker bus near junction three of the M5 
at Halesowen.

The driver of 
the bus, which was reported to have broken down amid thick fog in a 
'live' lane of the M5 near Frankley Services, remains on bail after 
being arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving 
following the crash, West Midlands Police said today.

Mr
Mapstone was en route from Manchester to Devon when his Volvo vehicle 
struck the single-decker bus, West Midlands Police said.

The force has confirmed the bus was carrying a party of fruit-packers.

The lorry driver’s family paid tribute to him today in a statement released by West Midlands Police.

They said: 'Our dad was tragically taken away from us while doing the job he so very much loved.

'We would very much like to thank the 
people who helped both us and Dad through such a tragic time, including 
all the emergency services that attended the scene to help Dad on the 
motorway to try and save him.'

Mr Ali’s family paid tribute to 'a loving husband' and father.

They said: 'Liaquat was the loving 
husband of Fozia Shaheen and was the father of two sons and a daughter -
Shafqat Ali, aged nine, Mohammed Owais Ali, aged two, and Kashish Eman,
aged six.

'He will be dearly missed by his family and friends and also leaves behind three brothers.'

Both families are being supported by 
family liaison officers and have asked that they are given privacy to 
deal with their loss, West Midlands Police said today.

The accident happened between junctions 3 and 4 of the M5 in the early hours of Saturday

The driver of the bus, a 49-year-old 
Birmingham man who has not been named, remains on bail in connection 
with the incident.

No-one has been charged with any offences at this 
stage, a force spokesman said.

A
28-year-old man from Smethwick, who was also a passenger on the bus, 
remains in a critical condition in hospital, the spokesman added.

The
Central Motorway Police Group was alerted to the crash at 6.24am on 
Saturday and emergency crews treated more than 20 bus passengers, who 
were being driven from Birmingham to the Evesham area of Worcestershire.

The southbound M5 was closed for around eight hours and a detailed investigation into the cause of the collision was launched.

Today, West Midlands Police said the investigation was likely to take some time.

Inspector
Mark Watkins, from the Collision Investigation Unit, said: 'Officers 
continue to investigate the circumstances surrounding the fatal 
collision on the M5.

'Inquiries
centre on the weather conditions at the time of the collision and how 
the bus came to be stationary in the carriageway.

'Officers are keen to speak to anyone who saw the bus travelling along the M5 prior to the collision.'

Anyone who witnessed the accident is urged to contact West Midlands Police.
