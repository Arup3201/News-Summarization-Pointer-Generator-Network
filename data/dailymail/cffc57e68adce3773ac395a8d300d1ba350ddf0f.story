Joanne Callen has accused Carole  Middleton, who is her godmother, of being 'snobbish'

A feud in the Middleton  family has taken a new turn, with Kate’s uncle wading in to  condemn scathing comments made by her cousin.

Joanne Callen spoke yesterday of her sadness at not having seen the Middletons since the Royal Wedding. She also accused Carole  Middleton, who is her godmother, of being ‘snobbish’.

Mrs Middleton, a cousin of Miss Callen’s mother, ignores the family and behaves as if she is ‘grander than the Queen’, Miss Callen claimed.

The 33-year-old’s words were met with dismay by Gary Goldsmith, the Duchess of Cambridge’s colourful uncle. He told the Daily Mail: ‘I love my family very much and I have to question Joanne’s motivation for doing this piece.’

Mr Goldsmith saw his share of controversy when undercover reporters filmed him allegedly preparing lines of cocaine at his eight-acre hideaway in Ibiza.

He has insisted he is still close to the family, but Miss Callen claimed he had been ‘dropped’.

She suggested Mrs Middleton, 59, used him as an excuse for shunning relatives by refusing to be seen with Mr Goldsmith at social occasions.

Miss Callen told the Mail On Sunday: ‘Carole doesn’t reply to invitations and doesn’t turn up at any family events. She claims that she won’t go anywhere where Gary is but I think she is just making excuses.

‘The real reason is that she is above us now. We’re not in her social circle. It’s as if we are not good enough now and she’s embarrassed by us. She is now even grander than the Queen.’

She added: ‘When I was a child Carole was really good to me. She was a very good mother, a lovely godmother, and I liked her. But she has always been a social climber and now I feel she is snobbish. She behaves as if we are not good enough for her now – so she does not need to respond to us or have any care.

‘At the end of the day, I’m not sure what the word goddaughter means any more.’

Miss Callen said she was sad never to have met Prince George, adding that her grandparents had bought him a gift but never had a chance to give it to him. She said that by speaking out she was going against her own family’s wish to remain discreet.

The Middletons did not respond to requests for comment last night.

Mr Goldsmith, who sold his recruitment firm Computer Futures for £275million, was once caught on camera at his home – dubbed Maison de Bang Bang – snorting cocaine and offering to obtain Brazilian prostitutes for Mazher Mahmood, the ‘fake sheikh’ undercover reporter for the now defunct News of the World newspaper.

In an interview last year Mr Goldsmith insisted he was close to his sister. He said: ‘Carole and I are both headstrong and can bicker, as all siblings do. But we are very close. We tease each other relentlessly. In many ways we are very similar: we’re both ambitious with lots of drive, we made our money young, are very loyal to our families and want the best for them.

‘But I’m the City yuppie and she’s the country girl. While I was driving a Lotus Esprit in my Gucci shoes, she had an Alfasud and wore Hunter wellies.’
