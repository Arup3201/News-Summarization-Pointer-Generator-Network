Speed humps have been torn out of a residential London street so that Olympic dignitaries can be chauffeured across the city in comfort.

The nine traffic-calming obstacles have been removed from Charlton Park Lane in Greenwich, which is near  one of the Olympic venues.

When the Games are over, the humps, which were installed more than 15 years ago, will be put back – at a total cost to the taxpayer of  at least £50,000.

The street’s proximity to the Royal Artillery Barracks, where the shooting and Paralympic archery events will take place, has led to it being designated part of the Olympic Route Network, along which competitors and executives from international firms sponsoring the Games will be ferried in BMWs.

After: Residents say traffic has sped up along the road as a result of the calming measures being removed

Transport for London (TfL), which is carrying out the work on behalf of the Olympic Delivery Authority, said electronic speed-warning signs and extra police patrols would be deployed.

But when a Mail on Sunday reporter visited the area last week, the signs appeared not to be working and there was no visible police presence.

Residents said they knew nothing of the plan until workmen started digging up the road last month.

Carly Arnold, 31, said:  ‘The traffic has definitely speeded up since the bumps were taken out.’

Brooke Turner, 18, said: ‘It’s as if the Olympics are more important than road safety.’

Ordinary motorists will be banned from some sections of the Olympic Route Network. Bus stops will be suspended, side roads closed and traffic-light timings changed to give priority to Olympic vehicles  at the busiest times.

Local Labour MP Clive Efford said: ‘If there is a danger to residents, the council and police must deal with it immediately. The Olympics will bring huge benefits to London but cannot take priority over road safety.’

TfL’s Garrett Emmerson said: ‘The temporary removal of the speed humps is to aid the successful operation of the Olympic Road Network in getting athletes, officials and others working at the Games to events at the Royal Artillery Barracks on time. The humps will be replaced with speed-activated signs –  a successful speed-calming measure – during this period.’

Greenwich Council said residents had been consulted about the plan and denied that safety had been compromised.
