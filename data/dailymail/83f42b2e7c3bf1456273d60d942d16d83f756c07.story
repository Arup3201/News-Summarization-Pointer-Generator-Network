Melbourne Zoo staff are going bananas after they announce a brand new edition to their gorilla family. 

Resident gorilla Kimya delivered her first baby on Saturday night.

The Western Lowland Gorilla gave birth in the Gorilla House night dens at around 6.05pm, marking the first gorilla birth in Australia since 2000.

The birth took place under the watchful eye of Otana, the baby’s father, and three older females in the group, Julia, G-Ann, and Yuska.

The sex of the baby is yet to be determined however mother and baby reportedly are doing well.

Zoo keepers have been unable to identify the sex of the baby at this early stage

The new bundle of joy is only the seventh gorilla to be born at Melbourne Zoo.

Kimya and Otana met in October 2013 as a part of an international breeding program for endangered species. Kimya was born in Australia’s Taronga Zoo with Otana making a much longer trip from Howlett’s Wild Animal Park in Kent, England.

Kimya and the baby's father Otana met through an international breeding program 

The baby is not yet on display and the Gorilla Rainforest area will remain closed today to give both mother and baby the chance to rest and get to know each other.

The baby's birth marks the first gorilla birth in Australia since 2000 and only the seventh at Melbourne Zoo
