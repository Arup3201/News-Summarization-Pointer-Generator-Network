Attacker: Nicholas Onofrio, 52, walked free from court despite being a 'high risk of serious harm' to girls

A children's disco DJ walked free from court despite sexually abusing a 15-year-old girl in bushes after a judge said his crime was not serious enough for jail.

Nicholas Onofrio, 52, attacked the teenager outside a roller disco party he was DJing at in Littlehampton, West Sussex, last year.

But, despite branding him a 'high risk of serious harm' to girls, Mr Justice Mackay said unpaid work was punishment enough for the unrepentant sex offender.

Leaving the court with a group of supporters, Onofrio hid his face from photographers, while one of his companions stuck her middle finger up at the camera and others smirked.

The mobile phone shop manager, who calls himself DJ Nicko and claims to have done nothing wrong, pounced on the girl when he went outside for a cigarette during the roller disco.

As her friends and other youngsters partied inside, Onofrio invited the girl to look into some bushes, then grabbed her and began fondling her breasts and inner thigh, the Royal Courts of Justice heard.

He told her: 'I can't wait until all those girls in there are 16, because I want to **** them so hard'.

She eventually managed to break free from his grasp and get to safety.

She did not tell anyone until she confided in a schoolfriend a couple of days later, but has since been shunned by some of her former best friends, the court heard.

'She lost what most young women regard as the most important part of their lives, the close friendship of other girls of their age,' said Mr Justice Mackay.

Abuser: Nicholas Onofrio, 52, who fondled the girl in some bushes outside the disco in Littlehampton

Onofrio, who is in a long-term relationship,appeared for sentencing had denied sexual activity with a child at Lewes Crown Court, but was convicted by a jury in May.

Although the trial was heard in East Sussex, the sentencing happened in London as that is where the judge is currently sitting.

Let off: Mr Justice Mackay ruled that the offence was not serious enough for a jail term

After the trial, the defendant was assessed by a probation officer, who said in a 'disturbing' report that he still poses a 'high risk of serious harm to adolescent females', the judge said.

'I am concerned about the risk you pose on a continuing basis to girls and young women on occasions such as these,' he continued.

But, because the activity did not go beyond a low level of seriousness, prison was not necessary, he said.

'In view of the nature of the conduct you had with her, interrupted as you may have been, this isn't sufficiently serious as to warrant a custodial sentence.'

The judge imposed a community order with 18 months' supervision and ordered Onofrio, of Littlehampton, to do 100 hours of unpaid work.

He also passed a sexual offences prevention order, banning him from unsupervised contact with children other than with their parents' consent.

'I am satisfied it is necessary to protect such persons from serious harm because it is the view of the writer of the pre-sentence report, and it is my view, that you present a high risk of such harm to adolescent girls,' said the judge.
