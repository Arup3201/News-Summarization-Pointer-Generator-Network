At first glance, it would be easy to see Call Of Duty: Black Ops 2 as 'just' another yearly update of the long-running and oft controversial series.

Indeed, developers Treyarch could have played it safe, delivering predictable thrills, gameplay and multiplayer that still would have guaranteed sales in the millions.

Lifelike: Harper is one of the game's main characters. What is immediately noticeable are the improvements in the NPC's animation and facial expressions. This is backed up with some brilliant voice acting.

But interestingly, this is not the case. And while aesthetically the game is similar to the others, Treyarch have tried to bring something new to series - and have largely succeeded.

You play (for the most part) David Mason, son of Alex Mason - the main character in the original.

The year's 2025 and you're sent on a mission to take down a terrorist called Raul Menendez - a psychotic, megalomaniac who you empathise  with one minute, and detest the next.

Although a slightly routine plot, it's how BLOP2 tells the tale that makes it stand out. There's an element of choice never before seen in the series.

Whether you kill someone or succeed in a mission may come back to haunt you later on. This is particularly evident in the Strike Force missions.

The outcome directly impacts the game's narrative - the often terrible consequences serving as an emotive reminder of your actions.

The futuristic setting also lends itself to drone warfare, which adds another element to predominately run-and-gun gameplay.

Although some missions force you to use robotic warriors, certain sections (for example, guiding the enormous CLAW) give you much more tactical freedom. You can use it for cover, or to draw fire while you flank enemies.

Although behind the smoke and mirrors level design is still rather linear, the element of consequence makes the story feel less like a bunch of loosely connected set pieces and more of a virtual Hollywood-style blockbuster.

This is helped by enhancements in the graphics. Although using the same engine as the original, lighting has been improved, and draw distances seem more impressive - adequately dealing with the more ambitious scale.

Taking the plunge: As expected, there are plenty of set pieces on show in Black Ops 2.

One level in the desert on horseback, in particular, acts as showcase in just how far the aging graphics engine has come.

But it is the facial animations and character models that steal the show.  All the characters boast perfect lip synching and wonderfully-emotive expressions.

It's mesmeric watching Harper, David Mason's battle-hardened teammate - suddenly be hit by panic and fear - his eyes widening and body tensing up. Then seeing his cheekiness and swagger when chatting up a woman later in the game.

These are real people - which makes the often graphic deaths that much more shocking when you witness them.

It's helped along by some brilliant voice acting. Although purists may notice Ed Harris no longer voices Jason Hudson, Tony Todd (better known as the Candyman) lends his likeness and voice to Commander Briggs, playing the role with menace and conviction.

But for many, COD's campaign plays second fiddle to its multiplayer, and thankfully, Treyarch have delivered - particularly with their Pick 10 system.

This gives you ten points to modify weapons and items of your choice. This allows you to create specifically tuned loadouts that are tailored to your playing style.

Run and gun: Most of the game is first person, but there are well-rendered cut-scenes which help break up the action, while also reinforcing the narrative.

Further welcome modifications such as the revised Score Streak replacing the Kill Streak mean that it's now much easier to rack up high scores.

Changes to Prestiging means that there are no stat resets when you reach a certain level - so you keep your weapon experience and challenge progress.

The usual multiplayer modes make a welcome return (albeit with a few tweaks), while Combat Training (against bots) provides to perfect place to hone your skills and rise up the XP ranks.

Then there is Zombies mode, which is the deepest one yet. It's incredibly fun taking on waves of the undead, made even more so by a number of gameplay tweaks.

There are lots of items that can be found and turned into defensive weapons, while the Tranzit world gives you much more freedom and scale to make your last stand as fun as possible.

There's no denying that some critics will write this off as yet another Call Of Duty 'mod'. But do so at your peril, because Treyarch have done to Call Of Duty, what Daniel Craig did for James Bond. Defied the norm, evolved the series and kick-started a lagging franchise.
