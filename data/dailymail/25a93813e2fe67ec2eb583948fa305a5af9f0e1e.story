Hospitals and GPs are to be ordered to go to war with the NHS’s worst ‘silent killer’ in a crackdown that health watchdogs say should save 12,500 lives a year.

Those that fail to tackle sepsis will be financially penalised, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt revealed yesterday.

The condition – also known as septicaemia, or blood poisoning – kills 31,000 people annually in England.

It is to be treated in the same way as hospital superbugs, which have been halved in the last few years.

Every GP surgery in England is to be audited between now and next March on its effectiveness at diagnosing the condition with a view to making necessary improvements.

Mr Hunt said that a new system for detecting sepsis in children under five is to be introduced in doctors’ practices and hospitals, before being extended to adult patients.

And in hospitals, new targets will be set for diagnosis and treatment – with financial incentives for those that perform best.

Public Health England will launch a public awareness campaign on the symptoms of sepsis, aimed at those most at risk.

Health Education England, the body responsible for education and training in the NHS, will try to ensure healthcare workers receive better training about the condition. Sepsis is a severe form of blood poisoning which occurs when the immune system overreacts to an infection, attacking organs such as the heart, liver, kidneys and lungs.

It causes fever, inflammation and blood pressure and clotting problems that can lead to multiple organ failure. Research suggests that opportunities to save lives are routinely missed because of delays in identifying the condition.

The plans have been announced by health secretary Jeremy Hunt, who said that a new system for detecting sepsis in children under five is to be introduced in doctors’ practices and hospitals

Sepsis accounts for 100,000 hospital admissions each year, and costs the NHS an average of about £20,000 per patient.

In England, 1,000 children under five are admitted to paediatric intensive care units annually due to severe sepsis, of whom 10 per cent will die. It has become a more common reason for hospital admission than a heart attack, and has a higher mortality rate.

Failings occur mainly in the first hours after arriving at a GP surgery or hospital, when rapid diagnosis and treatment with intravenous antibiotics can be critical to the chances of survival.

Julie Mellor, the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman, first highlighted the problems with the early diagnosis and treatment of sepsis in a report last year featuring cases of avoidable death.

‘We warmly welcome these actions across the health system on recognising and treating sepsis, which taken together could help save up to 12,500 lives each year,’ she said.

The plans were in part inspired by the case of three-year-old Sam Morrish, who died in December 2010 following delays in the diagnosis and treatment of sepsis.

The ombudsman found that Sam, from Devon, would almost certainly have survived had he been given antibiotics sooner.

Mr Hunt told the Daily Mail he wanted to make tackling sepsis as important to the NHS as tackling the superbugs C. difficile and MRSA.

‘There has already been good progress,’ the Health Secretary said. ‘We have virtually halved C. diff and MRSA infection rates in the last four years.

‘Sepsis kills more than 80 people in England every day. It’s time to apply the lessons we’ve already learnt on patient safety and reduce the number of lives that are needlessly lost to this silent killer.’

Sepsis is a virulent form of blood poisoning which occurs when the immune system overreacts to an infection, usually bacterial.

The infection can attack organs such as the heart, kidneys, liver and lungs, causing fever, inflammation, abnormal blood clotting, shock as a result of plummeting blood pressure and, eventually, multi-organ failure.

Sepsis is one of the biggest killers of hospital patients, but it is also possible to develop the condition outside hospital as a result of having a minor infection.

Prompt diagnosis of sepsis is essential followed rapidly by treatment – delay is associated with greater risk of death. Intravenous antibiotics are the first line of treatment, along with oxygen, fluids and medication to increase blood pressure.

The most common causes of severe sepsis are pneumonia, bowel perforation, urinary infection, and severe skin infections. Dialysis for kidney failure and breathing support for respiratory failure are necessary for the worst affected cases.

Experts say sepsis is becoming more common, partly because of a rising number of elderly people with weakened immune systems or underlying diseases such as cancer.
