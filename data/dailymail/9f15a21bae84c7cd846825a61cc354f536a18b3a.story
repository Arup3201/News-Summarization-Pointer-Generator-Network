Towards the end of this remarkable game at Old Trafford, David de Gea managed to make a save from Mario Balotelli while looking in the opposite direction. 

At the other end, Brad Jones’ goalkeeping for Liverpool was characterised by one moment when he dived the wrong way and another when he fell over. Not surprisingly, Manchester United scored on both occasions.

It would be wrong to say Jones – Liverpool’s reserve goalkeeper – was to blame for this defeat. He wasn’t. He didn’t have a terrible game.

Nevertheless, the Australian’s afternoon was perhaps symptomatic of Liverpool’s current problems in that if something can currently go wrong then it probably will.

Here at Old Trafford, Liverpool managed to lose while playing the better football. They managed to create the better chances and take none of them.

As odd as it sounds, this was an afternoon that actually served to remind us that Liverpool still have some very good players. At times, Brendan Rodgers’ team played some incisive, dextrous football. In their better moments, they passed the ball well and moved intelligently.

Their great rivals, on the other hand, were only sporadically fluent. At times there was very little flow to their football.

Louis van Gaal’s team, however, broke with purpose on some occasions and devastatingly on others. Their goals came from rapier thrusts while Liverpool seemed to invent new ways not to score. Crucially, United did not make the mistakes in their own half that Liverpool did.

This is not to denigrate United. They are still finding their way under Van Gaal. The Dutch coach’s inability to field a settled side continues to hamper progress in what United hope will one day be viewed as a pivotal season in the post-Alex Ferguson years.

Afterwards, Van Gaal spoke about how easily his players gave the ball away. It is a recurring theme. The United manager, however, will not have woken this morning worried about what he can do that is new when he arrives at training today. His team have six wins from six and, despite their shortcomings, are at least moving forwards.

Rodgers has no such comfort. One of a football manager’s most debilitating problems is one that refuses to go away no matter how many different ways he tries to solve it. As he admitted after the game, Rodgers’ team’s defending just will not get better.

At times there is only so much a manager can do.

The Brazilian midfielder Philippe Coutinho was one of Liverpool’s better players on Sunday but he trailed to track Wayne Rooney midway through the first half and United took the lead.

Speaking on TV, former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher called Coutinho’s lack of diligence ‘unforgivable’ and ‘lazy’ and he was similarly unimpressed as Martin Skrtel failed to get close enough to Robin van Persie for United’s second goal and Dejan Lovren presented the ball straight to Rooney in the build-up to the third.

For Liverpool every day is Groundhog Day. It is impossible for them to move forwards while they are chained to this uncertainty. Rodgers insists he does not need a defensive coach. If that is the case then maybe he just needs better defenders.

On Sunday United were once again forced in to something new at the back. A training ground injury to Marcos Rojo saw Phil Jones rushed back while Michael Carrick dropped back to bolster a three-man defensive line that also featured the club’s best nuts and bolts defender Jonny Evans.

Once again it had a look of make-do-and-mend about it but United are learning to get through. Crucially, some players are improving.

Carrick was exceptional – we expect that – but Antonio Valencia and Ashley Young have become far better wing-backs than anybody would ever have imagined and it is these things, these small improvements, that, when put together, can make the difference.

Liverpool have no such improvement to bolster them as they anticipate challenges ahead. Indeed, on this evidence and that of recent games, it is hard to imagine them heading to Bournemouth in the Capital One Cup on Wednesday without encountering further problems.

Rodgers’ decision to select Jones in goal was peculiar. Liverpool’s number one Simon Mignolet is not really good enough but his understudy certainly is not.

The 32-year-old’s first contribution was to slice a clearance up in to the air, his second to dive the wrong way as Rooney struck blow number one from the edge of the penalty area.

Goalkeeping was not what killed Liverpool, though. They continue to look like a team that doesn’t really believe it can win and at the end captain Steven Gerrard looked resigned rather than crestfallen.

It was an interesting image. As his contract issue rumbles on at Anfield, one wonders if he will ever be back here in Liverpool colours again.
