The Charlie Hebdo killers and the fanatic who died in a gun fight in a Paris kosher grocery store are all part of the same terror gang which flourished in the heart of Paris and whose tentacles spread to hate preachers Abu Hamza, Abu Qatada, and top leaders of Al Qaeda in Yemen and ISIS.

Both Cherif Kaouchi, one of the brothers behind the massacre of 12 at the Paris satirical magazine and Ahmedi Coulibaly, who held up to ten hostage on Friday in a kosher supermarket, are graduates of the Buttes Chaumont gang – named after the Paris park where they were radicalised more than ten years ago. 

The revelations that Kaouchi and Coulibaly - both killed on Friday afternoon - were in contact with some of Europe's most notorious fanatics will only raise more questions of the French authorities' failure to stop Wednesday's atrocity at Charlie Hebdo's office and the carnage that has followed.

Mentor: Djamel Beghal, a key al Qaeda leader of recruited terrorists while worshiping at London's Finsbury Park Mosque, met Cherif Kaouchi and Ahmedi Coulibaly in prison in France

Hatred: Beghal was linked to many known terrorists - including hook-handed cleric Abu Hamza

Notorious: Kouachi was mentored by terrorist Beghal, who has links to London's Finsbury Park mosque

Until this week, the Buttes Chaumont gang was a name which appeared to have drifted into relative obscurity. 

But in the early 2000s, members of the gang were considered 'pioneers' of the foreign jihadi movement, raising money for terrorist attacks and sending fighters to Iraq.

Named after a park in the 19th arrondisement, the members were young and disaffected: Cherif has been described as a 'loser' working as a pizza delivery boy during the period into drugs, girls, petty crime and alcohol.

They appear to have first come to the notice of the police during protests against the Iraq war; later, members would be jailed for a range of offences linked to terrorism. 

And it was while in prison that both Cherif and Coulabily found a new mentor: Djamel Beghal, a key al Qaeda leader of recruited terrorists when he worshipped at London's Finsbury Park Mosque.

Former MI5 informant Reda Hassaine described Beghal as a 'constant presence' at Finsbury Park Mosque in the late 1990s.

He said he was particularly close to extremist preacher Abu Qatada, but also mixed in the same circles as Abu Hamza.

Hamza was jailed for life by a New York court today after being convicted of international terrorist offences.

But Benghal's influence was felt on both sides of the Channel, having lived in Leicester for several years after moving his family from France.

Beghal is said to have recruited shoe bomber Richard Reid and Zacarias Moussaoui, the '20th hijacker' in the attacks of September 11, 2001.

He openly admitted  meeting Osama bin Laden as he recruited British jihadists to fight in Afghanistan, and was jailed in 2005 for plotting to bomb the US embassy in Paris.

MI5 informant Reda Hassaine told the Telegraph: 'There is no doubt that you can see the influence of their teachings in him.

'Their warped view of the world has filtered down through him to a new generation.

'What happened in Paris was the legacy of Abu Qatada and Abu Hamza.

'A completely new generation, who have never met these people in London, have learned their ideology indirectly and are now willing to die in jihad.'

The two young men maintained contact with Benghal after being released from jail: Cherif was secretly photographed by French intelligence officers meeting Beghal while he was under house arrest in Murat in central France in April 2010.

According to French police reports, Coulibaly also made secret visits to Beghal's home after his release from prison.

Cherif, who was jailed twice for terrorism-related offences, in 2005 and 2008, was photographed playing football and exercising with Beghal in prison by surveillance teams. 

But it was a plot to free another jailed Islamist Smaïn Aït Ali Belkacem which first clearly linked Coulibaly and Cherif. 

Both men were killed this afternoon after police stormed the supermarket and office where they had been holding hostages

Belkacem was a leading members of the Algerian terrorist group GIA, or Armed Islamic Army, and was behind the attack on a suburban station which left 30 people injured. 

Both men would be named suspects in the 2010 plan, while it would Beghal who would later be named as the person behind the failed scheme.

However, it would be another member of Buttes Chaumont who gave the brothers the strongest link to what is now the world's most notorious terror network, Isis.

Boubaker al-Hakim was a member of Buttes Chaumont, and was jailed alongside Cherif in 2008.

Like Cherif, he lived in the 19th arrondisement, and became radicalised as a teenager.

Hakim, who is of Tunisian origin, was to become a key figure in recruiting young French Muslims to fight in Iraq, and both he and Cherif  rejoined the al Qaeda network in Iraq on their release from prison.

Yet while Cherif seems to have kept a relatively low profile in the past few years, Hakim has risen to prominence as a fighter with Isis.

He claimed responsibility for the 2013 murder of two Tunisian Left-wing opposition politicians, claiming responsibility for it in a video released by Isis last month.

'We will return and kill several of you,' he warned. 'You won't live in peace until Tunisia applies Islamic law.' 

Jean-Pierre Filiu, an expert at Sciences-Po University in Paris, told the Telegraph this link would have been crucial. 

'It is impossible an operation the scale of the one that led to the massacre at Charlie Hebdo was not sponsored by Daesh [Islamic name for Isis],' he said.

However, a witness quoted by Paris newspaper 20 Minutes as saying one of the assailants cried out before getting into his car: 'Tell the media that it is al Qaeda in Yemen!'

This too is eminently possible, although this time is is Said who is believed to have strong links to the group, known as AQAP (al Qaeda in the Arab Peninsula).

Said is said to have met leading the US-born al Qaeda preacher Anwar al Awlaki during a trip to the middle eastern country in 2011.

The Yemeni source said Said, 34, was among a number of foreigners who entered the country for religious studies.

'We do not have confirmed information that he was trained by al Qaeda but what was confirmed was that he has met with Awlaki in Shabwa,' the source said, noting that he could have been trained in one of the large parts of Yemen not under the control of the authorities back in 2011. 

AQAP emerged as one of al Qaeda's most aggressive international affiliates and a direct threat to the United States, when it claimed responsibility for an attempt by a Nigerian man, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, to down a Detroit-bound airliner on December 25, 2009 with a bomb concealed in his shoe.

It said it was also behind a foiled plot to send two air freight packages containing bombs to the United States in October 2011. 

However, Awlaki- who was seen as an influential international recruiter to the al Qaeda movement - had been killed the month before in a drone strike widely attributed to the CIA.

The mass murder at Cherif Kouachi's hands appears to have taken the French security services by surprise.

There are suspicions he may have been written off as a 'failed jihadist' after reverting the low-level crimes and chaotic lifestyle of his youth.

Experts suspect a French-Tunisian jihadist now fighting for ISIS could link Cherif Kouachi and Islamic State militants occupying swathes of Iraq and Syria.

Boubaker al-Hakim claimed responsibility last month for assassinating two politicians, Chokri Belaid and Mohamed Brahmi, in Tunisia in 2013.

Al-Hakim was previously part of the Butte Chaumont network alongside Kouachi and experts believe Islamic State must have played some role behind the sophisticated attack.

Jean-Pierre Filiu, of Paris's Sciences Po university, said it is 'certain' that Islamic State is following events closely and may well be preparing a video claiming responsibility.

Suspicions that Islamic State were aware of the attack were heightened by a mysterious tweet by a jihadist 24 hours beforehand.

Reading simply: 'snail eating people' it was followed by a second message 'you heard it here first #snaileaters ate lead' posted within hours of the shooting.

In a further development, a senior intelligence source revealed Said Kouachi met Al Qaeda preacher Anwar al Awlaki during a trip to Yemen.

The official said the terrorist suspect travelled to the country for 'several months' in 2011 with several other foreign fighters.

Awlaki, who was killed in a drone strike in September of that year, is one of the most influential Islamist figures of modern times.

His huge catalogue of videos and audio sermons remain a grim inspiration for Islamists in all corners of the world.

The Yemeni source said: 'We do not have confirmed information that he was trained by al Qaeda but what was confirmed was that he has met with Awlaki in Shabwa.'

The southern province of Shabwa is a lawless area where Al Qaeda militants and the security forces have clashed in recent years.
