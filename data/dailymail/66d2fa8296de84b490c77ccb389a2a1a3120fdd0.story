The grandson of former Vogue editor Clare Rendlesham was found hanged after reading Aldous Huxley's Brave New World novel.

Maximillian Bromage’s body was discovered in August after spending the weekend alone in his family’s London town house.

The 19-year-old, described as a ‘deep 
thinker’, died just a week after enjoying a weekend with his parents at 
their home in Wales, an inquest heard today.

His father, Charles Bromage, told 
Westminster Coroner’s Court a copy of Aldous Huxley novel Brave New 
World was found in Maximillian’s bedroom after his death.

He said: ‘He had obviously been reading it that evening, and unfortunately it has a similar ending.'

In the novel, John, dubbed 'the Savage' is found hanged in his lighthouse retreat.

Maximillian’s grandmother, fashion pioneer Lady
Rendlesham, made her name working for Vogue during the Swinging 
Sixties, and went on to open the first Yves Saint Laurent store in the 
UK, in Bond Street.

Her
daughter Jaqumine, Maximillian’s mother, followed in her footsteps, 
working as a director for Yves Saint Laurent until 1999 before setting 
up business with her husband.

Mrs Bromage said this morning they 
had hoped Maximillian, who had shown a flair for fashion and design, 
would follow them into the family business.

She said: ‘You always hope if you have a business your child goes into it, and the opportunity was there if he wished.'

The family saw no signs Maximillian was unhappy, and they have been ‘deeply affected’ by his death.

She added: 'We had absolutely no inclination whatsoever.

‘At the weekend, he was on very good form, helping me cook and running with my husband.

‘Looking back at things, we had absolutely no idea.’

Maximillian, a student at Aberwysth, had visited the family home in Presteigne, Powys, the weekend before he died.

A sports enthusiast, he enjoyed running, climbing, hunting, and kickboxing, and had been skiing since the age of three.

‘He was completely flawless and was prepared to stand his ground for whatever he felt was right’, said coroners officer Lynda Morris reading a family background statement.

‘He had every opportunity in life he could ever have wished for.’

Maximillian was due to do work experience with the family firm, Indigo Investment Services Ltd when he died, on August 6 this year.

He had travelled back to London from Wales a few days earlier, and was due to go to a concert with his girlfriend Cammie the day after he was found dead.

His father said the couple had a ‘volatile’ relationship, and Maximillian had spoken to her for 20 minutes just after midnight the night he died.

‘I asked her if she was going out with Max and she said yes’, Mr Bromage said of the call he made to Cammie shortly after learning of his son’s death.

‘I think if she had thought otherwise, she wouldn’t have made that statement.

‘She has been deeply upset by it.’

Maximillian had been staying his paternal grandparent’s London home in Knightsbridge, when he died.

Decorator Nigel Hall, a family friend for 15 years, entered the home at 9.30am to collect some tools and found Maximillian’s lifeless body on the first floor.

PC Cherelle Roberts, the first officer on the scene, said there was no suicide note, and his laptop and mobile phone did not have any significant clues.

She added of two note books found in his bedroom: ‘The large note book contained many love letters between Maximillian and his girlfriend Cammie.

‘The small note book was more of a diary of Maximillian’s feelings over the last six months or so before his death.’

‘But there was nothing dated from that day or indications of how his mind-set was leading up to it.’

The inquest heard Maximillian grew up in Notting Hill Gate, west London, before the family moved to Wiltshire when he was eight-years-old.

He was educated at Summerfield School in Oxfordshire and then chose to go to Shrewsbury School instead of Eton College.

He was tutored for his A Levels at Oxbridge, getting the grades to go to university to study International Relations and Strategic Studies, but was hoping to retake his A Levels to get better grades when he died.

He had spent months in Nepal teaching English to children in late 2011 before returning to the UK.

Assistant Deputy Coroner Darren Stewart returned an open verdict, after ruling he could not be sure Maximillian had meant to kill himself.

‘He had a volatile relationship with his girlfriend, he was making plans into the future, and this was reflected in the mood swings he documented himself in the notebook’, he said.

‘All this suggests this is a case where other explanations are possible that might explain his actions on the day in question.’

The post mortem ruled Maximillian Bromage, of Powys, died of hanging.
