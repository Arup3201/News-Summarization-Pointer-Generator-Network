A wonderful set of photographs taken in China and Japan which gave the Western world one of its first glimpses of the Far East is going for auction.

And one particular image of Chinese corpses at North Fort in Peiho in 1860 has presented a stark reminder of the Second Opium War.

The North Fort was one of several Taku Forts - strategically-placed defences in China that guarded the mouth of the Peiho River.

The fort, which was located near 
modern-day Tianjin, was breached on August 20, 1860 and its garrison 
surrendered after a fierce fight.

Grim war images: Portraits of dead men. Renowned photographer Felice Beato took pictures as he travelled with the British Army

The
 battlements and cannons are seen surrounded by Chinese corpses, 
following the fort’s capture by the English and French armies.

The
 opium wars were the climax of trade disputes between China and the 
British Empire over Chinese attempts to restrict British opium 
trafficking.

China was defeated in both the First Opium War, from 1839 to 1842 and the Second Opium War from 1856 to 1860.

The
 set of pictures were taken by Felice Beato, who travelled with the 
British Army during the Indian Rebellion and the Second Opium War in 
China.

Renowned photographer
 Mr Beato captured the Imperial Summer Palace in Beijing before it was 
destroyed by fire by Empire forces in 1860.

Canal: Yokohama. The pictures were taken by Felice Beato, who travelled with the British Army during the Indian Rebellion and the Second Opium War in China

Statue: Dai Butsu, Yokohama. Some 68 prints taken from the original negatives were made into an album that Mr Beato sold to Captain Roderick Dew

Jail time: Chinese Prison. The album has remained in the Dew family for the last 150 years and has served as a record of the Captain's service in China and Japan

His images also include a panorama 
view of Hong Kong harbour, the Forbidden City in Peking, a pagoda and 
scenes of slain Chinese soldiers at a fort.

Some
 68 prints from the negatives were made into an album he sold to Captain
 Roderick Dew, who led the British during the Taiping Rebellion in 1862.

Mr
 Beato's studio in Yokohama, Japan, was destroyed in a fire soon after 
along with the original negatives, making Cpt Dew's prints more 
valuable.

The album has remained in the Dew family for the last 150 years and has served as a record of his service in China and Japan.

Cpt Dew, who lived from 1823 to 1869, was also known for his important role in the attack on the Taku Forts during the Second Opium War in 1859.

At the time Cpt Dew was the Commander of HMS Nimrod, and described the attack in a personal letter to an unknown recipient.

It said: ‘We had to steam some distance before our guns would bear and then six shells plumped right into the Southern forts and exploded.

‘I saw the poor devils carried out in a fearful state - many naked and quite black… the huge brass guns tumbled about.'
