The heartbroken parents of a stillborn baby who died after a series of blunders had to grieve on a packed maternity ward because the hospital's bereavement suite was being used for storage.

Kerry Watson, 28, had to endure the torment of delivering her lifeless child Cameron naturally after hospital staff ignored a scan which revealed he was being starved of oxygen in the womb.

A review into maternity services within Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust has now revealed that if he had been delivered just one day earlier by emergency caesarean, he would have survived.

Scandal: Kerry Watson, 28, had to endure the torment of delivering her lifeless child Cameron at Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield and then grieve surrounded by other mothers

Appallingly, Kerry and husband Craig, 27, were then left to recover on a ward alongside new mums because the bereavement suite was being used to store records - something the report describes as 'almost beyond belief'.

Kerry, who also has an eight-year-old son, said: 'I was in labour for 24 hours and for most of this time, we were left alone. I felt that the staff didn't want to face us and we were totally unsupported through the process.

'This was the most horrendous experience of my life but to top it off, midwives said the only place available for me to recover was on the ward with all the new mums.

'There was no way I could do it so we were sent home.'

The couple of Normanton, West Yorkshire, had struggled to conceive so were 'overjoyed' when they found out she was pregnant with their second child.

But she started suffering pains on Boxing Day 2011 and visited Pinderfields Hospital having not felt the baby move for some time.

Staff carried out tests but put it down to Cameron being a sleepy baby, despite Kerry pointing out the fact he had always been very active.

By 3 January 2012 Kerry was still concerned so she and Craig went back to hospital - and only a faint heartbeat was detected.

However, as Cameron had not met the essential criteria on the monitor, Kerry was referred through to the Consultant - who failed to check the results that had been printed from the monitor and instead told the couple to return the following day.

Ms Watson said: 'After a student midwife and a senior midwife could not find a heartbeat, a doctor eventually came in and placed a scanner on my stomach and turned the screen to face us.

'It was obvious our son's heart was not beating. We asked whether our son was alive but no one would answer and a radiographer was then called in.

'She took pictures on the scanner for five minutes. We were totally distraught by this point and finally she said, "I'm sorry, he's gone".

'We were in complete and utter disbelief. We had known for days that something wasn't right but hospital staff made us feel that we were being a nuisance and tried to brush it all under the carpet.

'It just breaks my heart to know that if Cameron had been delivered by caesarean or even the day before when we saw the consultant, he'd still be alive today but instead we felt we were ignored and dismissed because we were blocking up the Consultant's clinic, which was the first clinic back after New Year.'

A review into maternity services within Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust following Cameron's death revealed concerns about staff's professional behaviour after a consultant was described as being unprofessional and rude in his approach with Kerry and Craig.

It also found that midwives were afraid to question the consultant's decisions when it was apparent the patient could be in danger and there was inadequate documentation.

There was inadequate assessment of clinical information and although a fetal heart scan identified Cameron's heartbeat as weak, it was not acted upon.

Finally, the investigation revealed a lack of skills in managing bereaved families and a lack of bereavement facilities.

The couple are speaking out for the first time after experts at Irwin Mitchell secured an admission of liability from Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust.

The consultant is now being investigated by the General Medical Council (GMC) and has restrictions on his practice.

Anna Bosley, a specialist medical lawyer at Irwin Mitchell's Leeds office who represents Kerry and Craig said: 'This couple has been devastated by the loss of their son Cameron and they understandably wanted answers about what went  wrong.

'Whilst we welcome the fact that the Trust has admitted responsibility, we back the couple's calls for proof from the trust that improvements have been made to maternity services to protect patient safety and prevent the same catalogue of failings being made again.'

Dr Richard Jenkins, medical doctor at Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust, apologised and said they recognised failings in care.

'We started an investigation immediately after these events with input from an independent clinician and we have already implemented changes as a result.

'While sadly we cannot change the outcome for Cameron, we believe the steps we have taken will minimise the risk of a similar tragedy occurring in the future.'
