Children should not be ordered to stand in naughty corners at school because it's an abuse of their human rights, according to academics at the University of South Australia.  

The common practise of excluding disruptive students from classrooms, which has been used by 85 percent of teachers in Australia in the last week, has also been called into question by professors at the University's School of Education.

Dr Anna Sullivan believes that removing children from classrooms because they are not behaving 'may be a breaching of their rights'.

She told MailOnline that the practice is 'not effective and is often used on kids who are already disengaged'.

She said there are two human rights in particular that could be affected by placing children on time out - the right to dignity and the right to education.

Dr Sullivan is holding a conference, called the Behaviour in Australian Schools Summit on 16 July, in which academics will come together to challenge the way teachers currently handle behaviour in classrooms with a specific focus on human rights.

She explained: 'Its intention is to be a bit provocative and ask the tough questions. We have to rethink things'

'One of the most common practices schools use is the step system,' Dr Sullivan said.

The step system involves warnings against misbehaving children which escalates into time out if they don't respond.

'Increasingly we're taking kids from the learning environment. Then they disengage and don't have a clue what is happening... it's exacerbating the problem,' she explained.

Dr Sullivan said she is not saying to ban things like naughty corners but says teachers shouldn't 'rely on them' as the first solution to an unruly child as they do not fix the problem.

She recommends teachers use a positive approach and said that the university's research has shown the best performing schools use  engaged learning.

'It's all about prevention and how do we get the child to engage. We're not saying what schools are doing isn't great work,' she said.

Asked how she would handle a child who is screaming and shouting in the classroom she said she would try to 'diffuse the situation and get back on task.'

'You need to question is it because a child has something happen at home? Do they have angers issues? Or maybe the teacher needs to work with the whole group.'

The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child consists of 54 articles and is guided by four fundamental principles. It was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1989 and was ratified by Australia in December 1990 but has not yet been incorporated into Australian law.

The four key principles are:1. EVERY CHILD, EVERYWHERE: Children should neither benefit nor suffer because of their race, colour, gender, language, religion, national, social or ethnic origin, or because of any political or other opinion; because of their caste, property or birth status; or because they are disabled.2. THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD: Laws and actions affecting children should put their best interests first and benefit them in the best possible way.3. SURVIVAL, DEVELOPMENT AND PROTECTION: The authorities in each country must protect children and help ensure their full development — physically, spiritually, morally and socially.4. A VOICE: Children have a right to have their say in decisions that affect them and to have their opinions taken into account.

The focus on children's rights at the conference comes comes as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child celebrates its 25th anniversary in 2014.

Australia's government has committed to making sure every child in Australia has every right under each of 54 Articles in the Convention and must report every five years to the Committee on the Rights of the Child highlighting what they are doing to ensure children's rights are being met.

An event listing for the conference on the University of South Australia's website said: 'This conference aims to challenge dominant thinking about behaviour and will examine approaches that respect students' human dignity, treat students fairly rather than equally, and promote humanistic and inclusive policies and practices related to behaviour.'

The conference aims to be a 'catalyst for collaboration' between groups that have an interest in behaviour in schools.

Professor Bruce Johnson, who will also speak at the conference, told Adelaide Now that 'some of the practices undertaken in schools from a conservative approach privilege the rights of the group over the rights of the individual'.

Professor Johnson explained that he wants teachers to treat students 'fairly'.

'You build relationships with kids, you treat them fairly, you talk to them a lot, you don’t cause an escalation over minor things (and) you negotiate with them,' he said.

This isn't the first time the practise of putting children in a 'naughty corner' has been called into question.

In 2011, a Melbourne education and parenting consultant claimed naughty corners and time out in bedrooms 'shame' and 'humiliate' children.

Kathy Walker recommends parents and teachers let the child have quiet time to calm down rather than punishing them.

'Even when this strategy is framed as a request for children to "sit and think about what they have done and then apologise", it is inappropriate. A child's bedroom should be a safe happy place of relaxation,' she told the Herald Sun.
