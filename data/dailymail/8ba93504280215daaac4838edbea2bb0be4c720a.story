Barack Obama, 50 Cent, Carly Rae Jepsen: all names of celebrities  who have thrown a ceremonial first pitch at an American baseball game. None, though, have been as strange as Darth Vader's appearance last Friday.

As is traditional at baseball games in the USA, a special guest threw the first pitch at the Texas Rangers v Seattle Mariners game on September 5, but it is rare to see a pitcher provoke as much fear in the opposition as this. 

The Star Wars character, once voted the third greatest movie villain of all-time, was flanked by two costumed storm troopers as he stepped up to the mound to pitch the first ball at Globe Life Park in Arlington, Texas.

Villain: Darth Vader was a special guest at Texas' Arlington Stadium on Friday

Scared: The infamous villain's throw left a lot to be desired

The ball itself left a lot to be desired, as the limp-wristed dark destroyer's throw dropped short of its destination, and the receiver had to dive low to his right to receive it.

It is unclear whether the moustachioed receiver, pictured below, was harmed by the throw, but both participants are clearly seen shaking hands in the aftermath of the incident.

Darth Vader is not the first celebrity to throw a disappointing first pitch. This comes after 50 Cent's disastrous attempt at a New York Mets game was labelled the 'worst first pitch ever' by onlookers.
