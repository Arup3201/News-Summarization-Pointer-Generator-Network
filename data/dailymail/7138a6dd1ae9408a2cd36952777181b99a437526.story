Beauty: The Romanian beauty is a well-known model in her homeland and has posed for a number of men's magazines, including Playboy in 2012

So when fans visited her page hoping to see the Romanian beauty - who shot to fame in her homeland after posing topless for Playboy in 2012 - in her usual array of swimming costumes and lingerie, they were confronted with something quite unexpected.

Some even took the post to mean her relationship with Daminuta had to be on the rocks.

Honest envy: When challenged over the bizarre snap, she puzzled fans further with a cryptic note that read, 'Envy is a sin, but honesty covers it. So I honestly envy this fluffy little thing'

Mystery illness: To make matters worse, she was forced to rush the affectionate pooch to hospital with a mystery illness

My bra didn't do it! As Romania's Twittersphere became awash with feverish speculation, she angrily claimed it had nothing to do with the previous day's shenanigans

When challenged over the bizarre snap, she managed only to puzzle fans further with a cryptic note that read: 'Envy is a sin, but honesty covers it. So I honestly envy this fluffy little thing.'

But hours later, events took a turn for the worse when the affectionate pooch fell ill with a mystery malaise, forcing the model to rush him to the vet. 

As Romania's Twittersphere became awash with speculation over how the bra could have poisoned the puppy, she responded angrily, claiming it had nothing to do with the previous day's shenanigans.

'He didn't eat the bra, he only nibbled it a bit, and then got bored,' she wrote. '+To suggest that he had been poisoned by the bra is really stupid as he didn't have it in his mouth for more than a second.'
