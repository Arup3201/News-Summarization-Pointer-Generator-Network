Paris Saint-Germain president Nasser Al-Khelaifi insists Angel di Maria wanted to join the Ligue 1 club before his move from Real Madrid to Manchester United.

The attacking midfielder broke British transfer records by moving from the Bernabeu to Old Trafford in a £60million swap during the summer, but Al-Khelaifi says it was not his desired destination.

The PSG president has said the Argentina international was itching for a move to the French capital, but the Ligue 1 winners were unwilling to meet Di Maria's asking price.

Chase: Paris Saint-Germain president Nasser Al-Khelaifi says it was not Di Maria's desired destination though

'Di Maria wanted to come to Paris but even without FFP (Financial Fair Play), we wouldn't have signed him,' Al-Khelaifi told Le Parisien, who then went on to attack Uefa's transfer policy.  

'I do not know if Michel Platini wants to kill French football, but FFP is not fair.

'It is very difficult to understand. The big clubs stay big and small clubs remain small.

'We respect the rules but want to discuss it with Uefa in October to try to change the rules a little.

'Otherwise investors will not come in football - they will go to other sports such as Formula 1.'
