Controversial independent senator Jacqui Lambie has interrupted Senate tributes for fallen cricketer Phillip Hughes, in a bid to force a rushed debate on her private bill to raise Defence pay.

In an attempt to hijack the government's agenda in the final days of the parliamentary year, Senator Lambie cut short a move to honour the young cricketer who died last week.

Under fire for her contentious move Senator Jacqui Lambie has offered an apology to the family and friends of Phillip Hughes.

Senator Jacqui Lambie's sense of timing has been called into question after bringing Senate tributes to fallen cricketer Phillip Hughes to a halt to introduce a debate on defence pay

Phillip Hughes will be farewelled at a funeral to be held at his old high school in Macksville

She stated: 'Like the President of the Senate, I thought that Phillip Hughes’ condolence motion was finalised, so I proceeded with my attempt to suspend standing orders, so that I could debate my Legislation, which would have guaranteed that members of our ADF receive a pay rise.'

The controversy coincided with Philip Hughes' funeral in his home town of Macksville on the NSW mid-north coast.

After a few moments of confusion, the Senate agreed to finalise its tributes to Hughes with a minute's silence.

Senator Lambie then moved to suspend all other business so that senators could debate her bill.

The move was supported by Labor but was defeated 34-33.

Senator Lambie's bill links ADF pay to that of politicians or CPI, whichever is greater.

Controversy has followed Senator Jacqui Lambie in Canberra on Wednesday after she curtailed tributes to fallen cricketer Phillip Hughes to ignite a debate on defence pay

It follows her pledge to vote against all government legislation until the government reconsiders the 1.5 per cent defence pay increased.

The government greeted Senator Lambie's move with hostility, initially denying her the right to speak.

'I'm asking you to give me a fair go and show me some courtesy,' she bellowed at government Senate leader Eric Abetz.

'This isn't about me, this is about the men and women who wear the uniform.'

In her statement Ms Lambie added: 'It was the first time that I moved a suspension of standing orders - and it appears that some want to use the slight confusion created over the transition from one Senate procedure to another, against me.

'I apologise to Phillip Hughes’ family and friends if my misunderstanding over Senate procedure has offended them. This must be a very difficult and sad day for them. The speeches given in the Senate for Phillip were magnificent and inspirational.'

Jacqui Lambie described Labor Senator John Faulkner's speech as particularly moving, speaking with 'eloquence, passion and compassion'.
