The European Union could survive without Britain but not France, outgoing Brussels chief Herman van Rompuy has claimed.

Bowing out as European Council President claimed a UK exit would only 'wound' the EU project, but the departure of France would leave it 'dead'.

And he mocked David Cameron's claim to have vetoed an EU budget rise in 2011.

Outgoing European Commission President Herman van Rompuy insisted the EU could survive without the UK

Mr Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's membership of the EU before holding an in-out referendum by 2017.

The Prime Minister is expected to use a major speech within days to announce Tory plans to curb immigration from the rest of Europe, including limiting the total number which can come to Britain.

However, he has clashed with senior Brussels figures and other EU leaders over any attempt to alter the principle of freedom of movement.

In a farewell lecture in Paris today, Mr van Rompuy said he believed the other 27 member states would be ready to look seriously at London's demands for change.

But he insisted that the fundamental principles of the EU were not open to negotiation.

Speaking at the Sciences Po Institute of Political Studies last night, Mr van Rompuy said: 'Without the United Kingdom, Europe would be wounded, even amputated - therefore everything should be done to avoid it. But it will survive. Without France, Europe - the European idea - would be dead.'

Looking ahead to Mr Cameron's promised renegotiation and referendum, the European Council president said: 'This is primarily a British debate. It is for the British people to decide.

'I think that the European partners would be ready seriously to examine those demands which are important for London, but not to negotiate on the fundamental principles of our Union.'

However, he took a swipe at Mr Cameron's claim to have vetoed a 2011 treaty change to tackle the euro crisis, describing it as 'an unfortunate attempt at a veto'.

The veto led to the other EU states pressing ahead with the same measures as an 'accord' between 26 members.

Mr van Rompuy acknowledged in August that 'the British question' would be a major challenge for Europe under his successor Donald Tusk, thanks to Mr Cameron's promise to renegotiate the UK's membership ahead of an in/out referendum in 2017 if Tories win next year's general election.

'For my part, I have never had anything to complain about from the British. Their Government has been constructive in the major negotiations on the European budget, on the climate or on our strategic agenda for 2014-19. 

'And often it has pulled others forwards, on the single market or on certain foreign affairs issues - Iran, Syria.

'Of course, the United Kingdom is not part of the largest project - the euro - nor in the Schengen area. But London has never prevented us from moving forwards.

'Admittedly, there was an unfortunate attempt at a veto in December 2011, but on banking union - the most important integrationist move since the birth of the euro - Great Britain has been very constructive, and rightly so, because community legislation was necessary.'

Mr van Rompuy said there was 'a more fundamental historical reason' for wishing the UK to stay in the EU.

'It is important that the British, who have been part of all the great intra-European wars since the 16th century, remain part of the great peace project that is the European Union,' he said.

'Besides, their presence is important in terms of political equilibrium at the heart of the European Union, including relations between the great countries.'
