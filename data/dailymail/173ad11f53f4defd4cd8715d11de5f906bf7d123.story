As a member of Scotland Yard’s elite diplomatic protection unit he was charged with protecting some of the UK’s most powerful people.

But married father-of-two Pc Ricci Giff abandoned his front line duties for trysts with his secret lover.

Their relationship was only uncovered when colleagues found pictures of her posing naked wearing his gun belt on his mobile phone.

Relationship: Photographs and text messages 
revealed the relationship between married father-of-two Giff, left, and 
Ms Ramsden, right, who committed suicide in December 2011

Yesterday Giff, 38, wept openly as he was sentenced to nine months in prison for his brazen dereliction of duty.

Southwark Crown Court heard how the 
officer was responsible for protecting vulnerable buildings including 
Downing Street, embassies and the homes of VIPs.

He worked 12-hour shifts, touring 
Central London on his motorbike, checking on properties and ready to 
respond to any emergency, including terrorist attack.

But he left his post three times after
striking up an affair with Melissa Ramsden, an attractive PR officer 
for the Israeli tourist board.

The pair exchanged sordid text 
messages, many about his uniform, as they plotted illicit rendezvous’ at
her flat and the Met’s Hendon training base.

Trysts: Melissa Ramsden, 37, was public relations manager for Israel's tourism office in London

Their affair only came to light after 
Miss Ramsden, 37, who had a history of depression, killed herself over 
unrelated work issues.

Investigators discovered their text 
exchanges on her phone and a photograph of her posing naked with his 
Glock 9mm pistol and Taser stun gun.

Jailing the shocked officer 
yesterday, Judge Anthony Pitts said his crimes could have spelt 
‘disaster’ for those he was meant to be protecting.

He said it was ‘quite difficult’ for the officer to respond quickly to an emergency if he was ‘in the middle of making love’.

But he added: ‘This is not a court of 
morals, I am not here to sentence you for having an affair with a young 
woman when you were married and your wife had just had a baby.

‘That is potentially tragic for you but nothing to do with the criminal courts.’

‘You made it quite difficult for you to respond quickly if you were in the middle of making love to her during these periods.

‘That is the criminality here, here is
your misconduct in a public office, taking yourself out of the line of 
duty in a way that is potentially serious.’

‘The text messages show the nature of the sexual attraction between you and her, perhaps you found it irresistible.’

The court heard Giff joined the Met in
1998 and eventually joined the respected diplomatic protection group as
an armed motorcycle patrol officer.

But in October 2011 he began an affair
with Miss Ramsden after they met at the Israeli Embassy in Kensington, 
one of the locations he guarded.

Over the next two months they undertook at least five sexual liaisons, including three when he was meant to be on duty.

The first took place on October 28 
when he told a fellow patrolman he going to meet a ‘friend’ in 
Paddington during a rest break.

Instead he travelled to Miss Ramsden’s Kilburn flat where mobile phone records later showed he spent an hour and a half.

During the tryst, another police team 
spotted his motorcycle outside and alerted the control room, but no 
action was taken when he re-appeared and rode off.

Over the next few days, the couple swapped text messages about their encounter and planned to meet up again.

Their second illicit meeting took place at the Met’s landmark training complex in Hendon, North West London, on November 5.

After starting work at 7pm Giff met her at the sprawling complex, with Miss Ramsden passing through security using a false name, and they spent two hours together.

The final encounter took place on December 1, after Giff spent the day guarding Downing Street and travelled to her flat.

During the liaison Giff gave Ramsden his utility belt, complete with Glock 9mm pistol and Taser, to wear. She later sent him a picture of herself naked, except for the belt.

Four days before Christmas Miss Ramsden sent her lover a text message which thanked him for ‘making her feel loved.’

Hours later she was found slumped beside her bed after taking an overdose. An inquest later heard she faced redundancy and had accused a colleague of bullying her.

Prosecutor Claire Howellsaid it was simply down to ‘luck’ that Giff was not suddenly required at an emergency during the encounters.

She said: ‘He was fully armed and supposed to be part of a high profile unit guarding very high profile targets.

‘He, more than anyone else, would have appreciated the potentially catastrophic results if anything did occur and his response was delayed.’

The court heard the affair took place during a ‘baby blues’ period following the birth of Giff’s second child with his wife of six years.

Defence barrister Richard Atchley said his client, who had an ‘impeccable record’, has been suspended from duty for over a year and will be now be sacked.

He said: ‘Mr Goff would to apologise to all those concerned, particularly his wife and the colleagues he has let down at the Metropolitan Police.

‘He has, as a result of his foolhardy involvement with Miss Ramsden, lost the career he sought after. He has paid a high price for his foolish and unprofessional behaviour.’

Speaking after the hearing, Commander Allan Gibson, of the Met, said Giff ‘let himself and his colleagues down’ and it was right he was dealt with by the courts.

Giff, of Sandy, Bedfordshire, admitted three counts of misconduct in a public office.
