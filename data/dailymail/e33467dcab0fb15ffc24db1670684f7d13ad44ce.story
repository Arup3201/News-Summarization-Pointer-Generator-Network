Farmers' subsidies: The money is being clawed back because of 'inadequate control procedures' in the handing out of farmer subsidies

The European Commission is demanding £86 million back from Britain for failing to stick EU farming rules.

The money is being clawed back because of 'inadequate control procedures' in the use of the farming subsidies member states receive from the EU budget under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) budget, a commission statement said.

National authorities are responsible for managing the bulk of CAP handouts, including checking the validity of farmers' claims for direct payments.

The commission carries out more than 
100 random audits annually to monitor national controls - with the legal
power to demand funds back if 'member state management and control is 
not good enough to guarantee that EU funds have been spent properly', 
said today's statement.

The
UK is one of 22 member states targeted for clawbacks totalling nearly 
£360 million for 'non-compliance with EU rules or inadequate control 
procedures on agriculture expenditure'.

The
sum demanded back from London is the biggest single clawback from any 
member state - more than double the £42 million being recouped from 
Italy for a series of alleged failures to verify the authenticity of 
farm subsidies claims.

In 
the UK's case, the repayment is for five separate cases of 'weaknesses' 
in England and Northern Ireland in processing applications for CAP 
support failure to carry out spot checks, and not adequately controlling
minimum requirements on the use of fertilisers and plant protection.

Meanwhile, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said on Tuesday he was convinced Britain would vote to stay in the European Union if a promised referendum takes place, despite opinion polls showing a plurality in favour of leaving.

However, he also told a Reuters Summit on the future of the euro zone the EU could not revise its policies just because one country was thinking of holding a vote on continued membership.

Prime Minister David Cameron promised last month to give Britons an in-out choice on whether to remain in the 27-nation bloc if he is re-elected in 2015, after trying to negotiate a reform of EU policies to meet British concerns.

'Knowing Britain a little bit, and knowing how important the business community is and the role that different parts of British society can have on this open debate, in case there is a referendum, I am confident that Britain will remain a member of the European Union,' Barroso said.
