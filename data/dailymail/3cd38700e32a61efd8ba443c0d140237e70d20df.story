Sharing capital: Nick Clegg hopes more businesses will adopt the John Lewis-style way of running to boost employee share ownership

Nick Clegg today outlined plans to boost employee share ownership and John Lewis-style businesses owned by staff.

Under his plans employees can be given a new, universal 'Right to Request' shares in the company they work for.

The Deputy Prime Minister is also setting up a commission to investigate the most effective forms of mutual ownership to give firms an off-the-peg guide to adopting employee shareholding.

Mr Clegg will appoint an independent expert to advance the idea and will host a summit to promote the 'John Lewis economy' in the summer.

He will say: 'Liberals believe strongly in the virtues of the market but only if it is a market for the many, not a market for the few.

'We don't believe our problem is too much capitalism. We think it's that too few people have capital.

'We need more individuals to have a real stake in their firms. More of a John Lewis economy, if you like.'

'The 80s was the decade of share ownership. I want this to be the decade of employee share ownership.'

Staff at John Lewis stores own shares in the company which Mr Clegg says leads to lower absenteeism, staff turnover and production costs

At an event hosted by the City of 
London Corporation and the Centre Forum think tank, he will say the 
concept of employee ownership has been a 'touchstone' of liberal 
thinking since the 19th century.

'And what many people don't realise about employee ownership is that it is a hugely underused tool in unlocking growth.

Shadow business secretary, Chuka Umunna, said the plan followed Labour's lead on responsible capitalism

'I don't value employee ownership 
because I believe it is somehow 'nicer' - a more pleasant alternative to
 the rest of the corporate world. Those are lazy stereotypes.

'Firms that have engaged employees, 
who own a chunk of their company, are just as dynamic, just as savvy, as
 their competitors. In fact, they often perform better.

'Lower absenteeism. Less staff turnover. Lower production costs. In general, higher productivity and higher wages.

'They weathered the economic downturn better than other companies.'

Lib Dem Business Minister Ed Davey will be in charge of the drive within the Government to work out the barriers to employee ownership so that they can be removed.

He will be looking specifically at the possibility of introducing a universal right for employees to request shares in the companies they work for.

Danny Alexander, the Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury, will be studying tax arrangements for employee-owned firms.

Mr Clegg will host a summit on the issue later in the year.

The John Lewis Partnership says it puts the 'happiness of partners at the centre of everything it does'.

All of its 76,500 staff own shares in the 35 John Lewis stores, 272 Waitrose supermarkets, johnlewis.com, a production unit and a farm.

Annually it has sales of over £8.2bn and staff 'share in the benefits and profits of a business that puts them first'.

The company has a constitution and permanent staff co-own it - an idea that was laid down by founder John Spedan Lewis who set up the partnership in 1864.

He signed away his personal ownership rights in what he described as an 'experiment in industrial democracy'.

A source close to Mr Clegg said: 'Nick
 wants to see real change in the way we do business, and firms that give
 employees a real stake.

'He is pushing his government colleagues for real, early, radical action on this.

'Employee ownership is part of a long liberal tradition of economic reform - putting power in the hands of workers to build a more responsible capitalism.'

Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said Mr Clegg was following Labour's lead on responsible capitalism.

'Ed Miliband has led calls for a more responsible capitalism and, despite having first scorned Labour's initiative, David Cameron now claims he has become a convert to the cause,' he said.

'The question for both him and Nick Clegg is whether they have the courage or the conviction to make the change that is needed.

'If Nick Clegg wishes to follow Labour's lead in promoting shareholder activism and engagement, that is welcome.'

Clegg today said he would continue to push for a 'mansion tax' on high-value properties but admitted he is facing stiff resistance from within the coalition.

He said that as a result of discussions with Conservatives, any progress on the tax would depend on 'give and take' negotiations.

Clegg is pressing Chancellor George Osborne to use his March 21 Budget to target the rich with new taxes, in the hope of countering concerns that the Government's deficit-reduction programme is unfair on ordinary families.

According to The Independent, as well as a tax on homes worth more than £2 million, Liberal Democrat ministers want the Chancellor to introduce measures to stop the rich avoiding stamp duty when they sell their properties.

Answering questions after a speech in the City of London today, Mr Clegg said: 'Very, very high-value properties are taxed in exactly the same way at the moment as properties which are a fraction of their value - so a £10 million property at the moment is taxed in the same way as a £1 million property.

'It is quite right for us - and Liberal Democrats have done this for years - to say 'Well, hang on a moment, should we be trying to look at some way to make sure that these people who own these multimillion-pound properties pay their fair share?'.

'I stick to my guns that I think that is something we should do.

'But this is a coalition Government. We didn't win the election. I lead a party with 8% of MPs in Parliament.

'If the Liberal Democrats were in power, I think we would have moved on this much, much more quickly.

'I will continue to argue the case for this. I hope we will make some progress, but this is a process of give and take in a coalition Government.'

Mr Clegg said it was a long-standing Liberal position, which he backed, to 'support taxes which capture unearned wealth and lower taxes on effort, enterprise, initiative and hard work'.
