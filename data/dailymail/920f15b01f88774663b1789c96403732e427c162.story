A hospital has suspended cancer surgery over fears that five patients died unnecessarily within a year.

Keyhole operations on patients with cancer of the oesophagus have been halted with immediate effect, the Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS trust announced yesterday.

The hospital had been one of the few areas in the country to do the operation and surgeons had been travelling around the world lecturing about its benefits.

Five patients died from 'potentially avoidable' complications after surgery at Maidstone Hospital

One of the patients who died was a 51-year-old father-of-one, whose lawyers say he was cajoled into having the procedure and ‘made to feel like a human guinea pig’.

The Mail understands that the surgeons filmed the operation on him last July –and it was broadcast live to a medical conference taking place in the UK

The same man died 16 days later from a blood clot and his family are now taking legal action against the trust.

Bosses have refused to name the surgeons involved, but the trust confirmed that the surgeons were still working, although the matter has been referred to the General Medical Council – which may decide to suspend them.

The trust has also luanched its own internal inquiry.

Solicitor Sharon Lam, acting for man’s widow, told the Mail: ‘There seem to be serious questions to be asked about the reliability of the procedure in question. New surgical techniques are vital but they must not be tried out on patients until they are safe.’

Initially, the patient was due to have the standard open surgery to remove the tumour as  which has a longer recovery period.

But days before the operation, surgeons persuaded him to have the keyhole surgery, as he would recover quicker. He also consented  for the procedure to be broadcast live at  a conference.

Miss Lam said: ‘He was made to feel really lucky to have this surgery rather than the conventional open surgery.’

Upper GI surgery has been suspended and the trust is now sending patients requiring it to St Thomas' Hospital in central London instead

The operation went well and 11 days later the patient was discharged. Five days later he suffered a major haemorrhage. He was taken to hospital, but died the next day.

Miss Lam added: ‘My client, the man’s widow, is very upset by the whole episode. She wrote a letter of complaint  to the hospital and the surgeon replied.

‘It is highly unusual as complaints are normally dealt with by the hospital trust, not by the consultant.

He said there had been complications that had led to the patient’s death. He did not say sorry or give any kind of apology.’ She added that the patient should have had a good prospect of recovery, but instead his death has left his family traumatised.

The keyhole operation normally lasts four hours, and involves removing the tumour and surrounding tissue using a microscopic camera and surgical instruments.

At the same time surgeons use part of the stomach to create a section of oesophagus to replace the infected section.

Patients of the trust in Kent are being sent instead to St Thomas’ Hospital in central London.

Medical director at the Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells trust, Dr Paul Sigston, said: ‘We are sorry that some patients did not receive the level of care and treatment that they should have due to potentially avoidable surgical complications.

‘We are in contact with, and have apologised to, the families who have been affected and have been clear that we need to make improvements.’
