Plans to force women to undergo independent counselling before they could have an abortion were dramatically scrapped yesterday.

Health minister Anna Soubry revealed that the Government now has no intention of changing either the law or guidelines on counselling – despite previous promises to consult on the issue.

The move was met with fury by pro-life campaigners, who accused Miss Soubry of imposing her personal beliefs on government policy.

Tory MP Nadine Dorries said it was ‘bizarre’ to scrap a consultation on plans to prevent clinics, such as those run by Marie Stopes and the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, from offering counselling to women at the same time as carrying out  terminations.

She said there was a conflict of interest as many pregnant women who seek advice from clinics go on to have abortions.

Instead, campaigners say ministers should have rubber-stamped proposals forcing women to take advice from counselling services separate from the clinic they had chosen to carry out their abortion.

Miss Soubry’s surprise intervention comes only weeks after the newly-appointed minister spoke out in favour of legalising assisted suicide.

During a debate in Westminster Hall, she said she had decided to call off the consultation because the Government had no intention of changing the law – adding that if ministers were to plough on regardless it would be an ‘otiose exercise’.

‘There is other work we should be doing on counselling,’ she said.

But Mrs Dorries accused Miss  Soubry of imposing her views on  policy. ‘What Anna Soubry has said today doesn’t improve services for women,’ she said.

Scrapped: Women will not be forced to undergo counselling

‘The Government has decided that it is not the right decision.

‘This announcement comes down to Anna Soubry’s very personal belief on abortion. She is as pro-choice as many Labour women MPs.

‘[Health Secretary] Jeremy Hunt believes in a 12-week limit but he is not trying to push his agenda on women because he acknowledges it is his personal belief.

‘What she has done is try to impose her personal belief on her role and that is out of order,’ she added.

A spokesman for BPAS – which would have had to send women  seeking an abortion to a separate counsellor under the plans – said: ‘Current abortion counselling arrangements serve women well, and so BPAS is pleased to see the Government has dropped its plans to unnecessarily overhaul services.

‘Calls to do so had been driven by a handful of MPs with an anti-abortion agenda who wished to create barriers in women’s access to care.

‘BPAS hopes that government  policy can now focus on efforts to support women trying to prevent pregnancy, and ensure the highest quality care for those who do need abortion services.’

In a statement released after the debate by the Department of Health, Miss Soubry said: ‘The most  important thing is that women get the help they need during a difficult time in their lives.

‘We consider that this important issue can be most effectively addressed by considering counselling alongside all aspects of unplanned pregnancy rather than separately.’
