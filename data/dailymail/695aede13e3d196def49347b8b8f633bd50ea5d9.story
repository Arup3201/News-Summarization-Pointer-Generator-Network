'Fierce': Snooki tweeted this picture to her fans as she went into labour

Earlier this week, Snooki admitted she was feeling apprehensive about becoming a parent for the first time.

She told In Touch Weekly magazine: 'I’m nervous that I’m not going to be a good mom. I just really hope I know what I’m doing!'

Snooki even said that while she had become famous for her partying and drinking on Jersey Shore, her pregnancy is crazier than anything she experienced throughout her time on the MTV show.

She said: 'At the Shore you’re going to hook up, get into a fight or go to jail. You only have three options. But being pregnant you have no idea what’s going on!'

After the birth she also has plenty of work planned, with her MTV spin-off series alongside castmate Jennifer J-WOWW Farley recently picked up for a second season. 

However, next time around, the show will now relocate to a large house on Johnson Avenue, in Manchester, New Jersey.
