Jack Rowe, three, has died after being found lifeless in the swimming pool of his family home in Wiltshire

A three-year-old boy has died after being found lifeless in the swimming pool of his family's £1.2 million mansion just 20 minutes after being reported missing.

Jack Rowe's parents alerted villagers across leafy Upavon in Wiltshire at 7pm on Wednesday, fearing he had wondered down to the river.

But minutes later, he was discovered by a female relative face-down in the 15-square-foot swimming pool.

Despite repeated attempts at CPR, Jack was airlifted to Southampton General Hospital where he was pronounced dead.

They said the owners of the home, Nigel and Olivia Rowe, had been living there for a couple of years.

Neighbour Jack Leach - who lives with wife Maggie, 64, in a nearby mobile home - said: 'I knew Jack was dead when we were around the pool when they tried unsuccessfully to bring him around.'

Mrs Leach said the first thing they searched was the river.

'We assumed the house had been checked. He had been there half an hour before they came to us.

'The family kept saying he did not go near the water. We searched the village but he was in the house all the time.

'We were in our garden and a lady came in and said a little boy had gone missing half an hour ago.

'His name was Jack. He was later found by a girl relative. It is such a tragedy. We did all we could. If I walked passed them I would not know them.'

Jack's parents, Olivia and Nigel (far right and second right), alerted villagers at 7pm yesterday fearing their child had wandered down to the river, but discovered him in the pool 20 minutes later

Mike Parr who runs the village shop said: 'A call went out for a missing child.

'There was a village search going on. Eventually he was found back at home.

'A lady asked me to call an ambulance on my mobile just before the police arrived. There were police officers trying to resuscitate him.'

Villager John Stevens said: 'I feel very sorry for whoever is involved in this because I have been there.

'I lost my lad at two years nine months old I know what the situation is. That was 52 years ago. I know exactly how they are feeling.'

A member of the family said: 'I am really sorry but we are not going to talk about it.'

Wiltshire Police said it was working with Hampshire Police to prepare a report for the coroner.

hours of this morning'.

'Wiltshire Police will now work with Hampshire Constabulary and partner agencies to prepare a report for the coroner’s office.'
