Jurors cleared Dave Lee Travis after a question to the judge revealed they were apparently grappling with the difficulties of historical allegations.

They offered a glimpse into their thinking when they asked the judge about the ‘lack of supporting evidence and the passage of time’.

There was no forensic evidence put forward and in none of the 14 counts was there a corroborating witness to the alleged assaults. As Travis himself told the jury, after the court had heard the women’s claims: ‘It’s their word against mine.’  

Cleared: Dave Lee Travis appears outside of Southwark Crown Court yesterday after being found not guilty of 12 counts of indecent assault

The jury comprised eight women and four men – the same male-female split as the jury who cleared Coronation Street star William Roache last week.

On the third day of their deliberations, they sent a question to the judge asking what to do if they believed a woman’s testimony but had no additional evidence.

The question read: ‘Miss Moore (the prosecutor), in summing up, said if we believe that the complainant was telling the truth, then we must find the defendant guilty.

'Can you give us any guidance on how that should be weighed with the lack of supporting evidence and the passage of time so we are sure beyond reasonable doubt?’

In response, the judge reminded them the prosecutor had said that, if they concluded what the complainant said was accurate and truthful, then they should convict.

The jurors went back into their room and continued deliberating for a further day. In the end, they decided to believe Travis’s account. 

Claims: The accusations had related mainly to Travis's time as a BBC DJ in the 1970s and 1980s

Yesterday Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe admitted police were caught in a ‘Catch-22’ dilemma when considering historical sexual allegations.

He said: ‘I think if a victim comes to us and makes an allegation they deserve a thorough investigation.

‘And we can hardly turn them away. In fact one of the criticisms in [Operation] Yewtree is that in the past 20, 30 years victims have been turned away and not listened to. It seems to me we are caught both ways.’

The jury that cleared Travis of 12 cases of indecent assault was made up of eight women - six of them young - and four men.

By coincidence, this was the same gender breakdown as the jury at Preston Crown Court that cleared Coronation Street actor William Roache of historic sex allegations last week.

After a four-week trial, during which Travis arrived alone each day to spare his Swedish wife the court ordeal, the jury deliberated for 21 hours and 50 minutes spread over four days.

In the Roache case, the jury only retired for six hours.

Yewtree was launched in October 2012 after Jimmy Savile, who died aged 84 in 2011, was exposed as a predatory paedophile who abused hundreds of victims.

It has already cost £2.7million, of which £490,000 has been paid out in overtime to the 30-strong detective team.

The operation has also led to 16 arrests, with four people charged and five suspects remaining on bail.

Police also revealed yesterday that further victims had come forward alleging sex abuse by comedian Freddie Starr.

Starr, who was first held in November 2012, is taking High Court action after he was bailed again yesterday despite assurances that a charge or release decision would be made.

The 71-year-old has been rearrested three times over further claims since he was first held. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Martin Hewitt said that additional alleged victims coming forward had lengthened the investigation.

‘All of the allegations deserve a thorough investigation. That’s what we do,’ he said.

Britain’s most senior prosecutor also faced difficult questions last night over her decision to charge Travis.

Relief: Travis, shown in a court sketch expressing his relief at the not guilty verdicts, told the jury: 'It's their word against mine'

Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders ruled last August there was sufficient evidence to charge the ex-Radio One DJ, real name David Griffin, with 11 counts of indecent assault and one of sexual assault.

A few weeks later, he was charged with two more counts of indecent assault – bringing the total number of charges to 14.

Mrs Saunders authorised the charges in her previous job as chief crown prosecutor for London. In a statement announcing the initial charges last year, she made clear she had carefully considered the evidence given by officers on Operation Yewtree.

She said: ‘We have also decided no further action should be taken in relation to seven separate allegations against Mr Griffin as we determined there was insufficient evidence.’

Jurors' thinking was hinted at in written question to judge

They asked whether believing a witness meant they must find Travis guilty

But they then cleared him of 12 charges of indecent assault today
