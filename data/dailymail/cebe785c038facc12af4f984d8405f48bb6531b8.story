England manager Roy Hodgson can count himself very fortunate that the FA have moved on from the World Cup debacle in Brazil with him still in charge of the national team.

The last word on England’s dismal showing comes from Greg Dyke in his chairman’s statement, contained in the annual FA accounts, to be published shortly after being lodged with Companies House.

Dyke, in copies circulated to FA staff, writes: ‘Sadly our involvement in the competition did disappoint. Despite the excellent preparation and planning by Roy Hodgson and all his team, we were once again left reflecting on an early exit and underachievement.’

Tellingly, though, Club England officials Adrian Bevington, Alex Horne and Sir Trevor Brooking — who, along with Dyke, backed the manager after England failed to get out of their group —are no longer at the FA. 

RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie has emerged as the best-paid boss of a national sports governing body in the UK. The latest RFU annual accounts reveal Ritchie took home a hefty annual package of £600,000. 

This is more than the £550,000-a-year the FA were paying departed general secretary Alex Horne. Ritchie has restored order at Twickenham after the 2011 World Cup debacle and has put his long-term faith in England coach Stuart Lancaster. 

Everything for Ritchie now depends on how the hosts fare in the World Cup on home soil.

The FA remained remarkably relaxed on Tuesday about the clinical director of St George’s Park healthcare partners Perform being held partially to blame in a £7million damages judgment on a Spurs apprentice suffering cardiac arrest and brain damage.

Specialist sports physician Dr Charlotte Cowie, who also worked for Team GB at three Olympics, was found to have made a serious error of judgment while head of Spurs’ medical services when she concluded teenager Radwan Hamed bore no risk of an adverse cardiac attack.

Hamed collapsed in his first game for Spurs — a youth match in Belgium. Spurs said the club ‘wholeheartedly regrets a former employee… was remiss in their duties to Radwan’.

The FA said: ‘This is a private action and third-party matter. We are confident all of the medical staff operating at St George’s Park for our partners are of the highest calibre.’

Judo turned down a £250,000 sponsorship of their European Championship from Ultimate Fight Championship because it challenged their teaching of the art

Judo, a sport that only really registers every four years at the Olympics, nevertheless felt able to turn down a £250,000 sponsorship of their European Championships in Glasgow from mixed martial arts Ultimate Fight Championship — and abort the competition — because it challenged their teaching of the art. 

European Judo Union president Sergey Soloveychik wrote to Kerrith Brown, chairman of hosts British Judo, saying: ‘We must secure the image of judo as a kind of martial art and of sport that has an educational mission.’

Racing’s fury at Clare

If Clare Balding hadn’t been on holiday, allowing her to swerve the Crabbie’s Grand National weights lunch on Tuesday, she would have been made aware of the upset at her decision to host the first televised women’s Boat Race rather than the National on April 11. 

The consensus was that Balding owes horseracing for her stellar broadcasting career, which she has repaid by snubbing their flagship event.

Meanwhile, Crabbie’s have not only ensured a £1m prize fund for the National, but their classy weights event at the Royal Opera House even included a rendering of Nessun Dorma from the in-house singing talent — taking the usual humdrum sports lunch to a whole different level.

Alex Horne, the departed FA general secretary, says in the annual accounts review: ‘Our disciplinary team handled a series of high-profile cases effectively.’

 However, the wheels of justice continue to turn very slowly with a complaint about a racist comment made by a Leeds player during a match against MPE in the Kent Sunday League still being investigated at county and FA level 13 weeks after it was lodged. 

An FA spokesman said the inquiry was ongoing.
