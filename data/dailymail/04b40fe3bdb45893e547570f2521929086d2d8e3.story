A mother who tragically lost her three daughters and parents in a house fire three years ago has found love and remarried.

Madonna Badger lost nine-year-old Lily and seven-year-old twins, Sarah and Grace, plus her parents, Pauline and Lomer Johnson in the fire at her Stamford, Connecticut, home on Christmas morning 2011.

Ms Badger, 50, has tied the knot with real-estate broker William Duke and posted a joyful picture on Facebook of them smiling on the steps of St John-St Matthew-Emanuel Lutheran Church in Park Slope, Brooklyn.

She wrote: ‘We did it! Bill and I eloped today!’ 

Hundreds of friends and well-wishers left congratulatory messages for the couple.

Terry Montgomery Engleman wrote: ‘Wow! Congratulations! Wishing you much joy and happiness in your new life together!’

Ray Forbes, meanwhile, posted a message that read: ‘I can’t imagine a more powerful affirmation to the human spirit. I wish you as much love, happiness, joy and freedom as is possible.’

Ms Badger, a former ad executive whose clients included Calvin Klein, wrote an article for Vogue last year in which she spoke about the agony that she’s enduring.

She said: ‘It’s never going to be easy. The pain is just so huge that sometimes it feels like a prison cell. But trying really hard to not feel sorry for myself makes me feel good. 

'Being of service helps the pain to go away, if only for a little while, and giving and receiving love makes me feel good. Basically, I go to wherever the light is, because anything else is darkness, and it can be a deeply black darkness.

'At a certain point, you can either be full of hate or full of love - it can go either way. I have no hate in my heart, no bitterness, and I am blessed by this.' 

The deadly blaze was started after Badger’s former boyfriend, Michael Borcina, put smouldering ashes from the hearth into the outside mudroom of their house, according to authorities.

Badger, however, is convinced that an electrical fault was the cause, having seen sparks shooting from an electrical box at the back of the house as the fire spread. 

She remains baffled as to why the smoke alarms installed in the property did not go off.

It was being renovated at the time and Badger’s ex-husband, Matthew Badger, is suing Borcina for wrongful death and negligence, claiming that the home ‘had become a firetrap as a result of months of substandard construction’, according to the New York Post. 

Matthew Badger had a tense chance meeting with Mr Borcina in New York recently. Mr Borcina asked Mr Badger if he could hug him, but the request was not indulged, according to nymag.com.

Ms Badger recently wrote an open letter to Houston shooting survivor Cassidy Stay urging the brave teen to ‘love all around you’ in order to ‘feel a tiny bit better.’

Like many, she has been inspired by Cassidy's smiling stoicism, despite losing her entire family.

Cassidy, 15, watched in horror as her ex-uncle allegedly executed her parents and four siblings at her family home.

The heroic Texas teen survived the July 9 massacre by playing dead when a bullet grazed her head, before calling police - an action which saved the lives of her grandparents, who Ron Haskell was intent on killing next.
