Eyewitness: David Boggs recorded the brawl on his cell phone and called 911 before leaving the scene

The driver who wrecked the vehicle in front of him jumped out and yanked the man in khakis out of his truck.

Boggs said a blonde woman who was riding with the man in cropped jeans then ran up to the two brawlers and jumped on top of the victim, pinning him to the blacktop.

The video shows the aggressor punching the immobilized man in the face with the woman seated on his chest.

The footage shows the enraged driver leaning close to the face of the restrained man lying prostrate on his back and pointing at him.

According to Boggs, the man who was attacked by the couple did not show any hostility towards them even as his assailant continued pummeling him.

Boggs eventually left the scene after dialling 911 because he said he feared for his own safety.

None of the people involved in the incident have been identified, and as of Tuesday afternoon no arrests have been made.

The Kentucky State Police are reviewing Boggs' video and will consult with the county attorney to determine if any charges should be filed.
