UN inspectors arrived in Iran today in the latest push to hold key talks with Iranian officials about how far the country's controversial nuclear programme has come.

Herman Nackaerts, a senior UN nuclear official, said yesterday in Vienna that he hoped for progress, but his careful choice of words suggested little expectation the meeting will be successful.

Their visit comes amid rising tensions after Israel announced it was planning to deploy rocket interceptors from its 'Iron Dome' defence system in the 
Tel Aviv region from today.

A spokesman said the technology was being incorporated into the 'heart of the Israeli military' and would be set up in different areas in the Gush Dan region of Tel Aviv in the coming days.

He stressed that the deployment was intended as a 
training exercise only, but it will serve to fan speculation that Israel is
gearing up for conflict.

Israel has become even more wary of its Middle Eastern neighbour after two Iranian warships docked at a Syrian 
port on Saturday - passing through the Suez Canal for only the second 
time since the Islamic revolution in 1979.

The vessels - a supply ship and a destroyer - have docked in Tartus, a port city in the volatile country which has been gripped by an 11-month uprising against President Bashar Al-Assad.

Iranian Defence Minister Ahmad Vahidi said the transit of the two ships through the Suez Canal into the Mediterranean 'is a symbol of our nation's marine capability,' it was reported in the Daily Telegraph.

Israel, which said it will be watching the ships closely, has welcomed sanctions against Iran in a bid to halt its nuclear ambitions.

But it has pointedly refused to rule 
out a military response to the crisis and in recent weeks sent signals 
that its patience is running thin.

British Foreign Secretary William 
Hague and the U.S. warned such an offensive would have grave 
consequences for the entire region and called on Israel to give 
international sanctions against Tehran more time to work.

U.S. joint chief of staff, General 
Martin Dempsey said an attack would not be 'prudent'. It was not known whether 
their messages were co-ordinated.

Mr Hague's rhetoric goaded Iran into cutting off oil sales to British companies after he accused the Islamist regime of promoting terrorism.

The oil ministry in Tehran announced 
that it had ceased all sales to the UK and France, escalating diplomatic
tensions triggered by Iran’s nuclear programme.

But the move will have little effect 
on British firms, which get well under one per cent of their oil from Iran
since the European Union has already slapped sanctions on the country.

The visit by the UN inspectors is the second in less than a
month by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) team and 
reflects growing concerns over alleged weapons experiments - something 
Iran denies and refuses to discuss.

The West suspects Iran's nuclear 
programme is geared toward making weapons but Iran insists it is for 
peaceful purposes only, such as power generation.

Iran's
state TV said the IAEA team arrived this morning for a two-day visit. 
The state radio, meanwhile, said the inspectors hope to meet Iranian 
nuclear scientists and pay a visit to the Parchin military complex.

The
radio said the IAEA had requested to visit Parchin, an Iranian military
base and conventional weapons development facility outside of Tehran.

The
site has also been suspected of housing a secret underground facility 
used for Iran's nuclear programme - a claim denied by the Iranians.

IAEA inspectors visited the site in 2005, but only one of four areas of potential interest within the grounds.

The nuclear watchdog did not report any unusual activities, and has not mentioned Parchin in its reports since 2008.

'Whatever the reasoning of the agency is, it proves the IAEA is not loyal to its previous commitments,' the radio said.

The tone of the commentary suggested the visit to the military complex would likely be denied.

The
IAEA visit comes as Iran last week announced what it described as key 
advancements in its nuclear programme - inserting the first domestically
made fuel rod into a research reactor in Tehran and installing a new 
generation of Iranian-made centrifuges at the country's main uranium 
enrichment facility in the central town of Natanz.

America
and its allies want Iran to halt uranium enrichment, which they believe
could eventually lead to weapons-grade material and the production of 
nuclear weapons.

Iran has been enriching uranium up to 20per cent, while
uranium enriched to more than 90per cent can be used for a nuclear 
warhead.

The IAEA team wants to talk to key Iranian scientists suspected of working on an alleged weapons programme.

They
also hope to break down opposition to their plans to inspect documents 
related to nuclear work and secure commitments from Iranian authorities 
to allow future visits.

Iran 
has denied alleged weapons experiments for nearly four years, saying 
they are based on 'fabricated documents' provided by a 'few arrogant 
countries' -- a phrase authorities in Iran often use to refer to the 
US and its western allies.

The IAEA 
summarised its information last November in a 13-page document drawing 
on 1,000 pages of intelligence.

It stated then for the first time that 
some of the alleged experiments can have no other purpose than 
developing nuclear weapons.

2012 was supposed to be the year of the economy.

But as that begins, like a giant oil tanker, to slowly change direction, Iran is another mighty problem looming on the horizon for Barack Obama, right.

The U.S. president promised a change of approach – who will forget the feeling of hope that accompanied his ‘New Day’ address to the Iranian people soon after his inauguration?

But some White House officials are now referring to 2012 as the Year Of Iran.

Steve Clemons, an influential blogger for the New America Foundation, a website for ‘new ideas and thinkers, is talking about ‘Obama’s impending "Cuban missile crisis"'.

And with the arrival of Iranian warships in the Mediterranean and a seriously unhappy Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu due to visit Washington in a fortnight, the Iranian problem has assumed the status of ‘major headache’.

Mitt Romney is making great play of Obama’s ‘dove-ish’ approach, saying a vote for him would pave the way for Iran to get the bomb, while Newt Gingrich, who has huge financial backing, is even more gung-ho on the way to tame Tehran.Which leaves Obama with some big questions should the West’s relationship with Ahmadinejad continue to deteriorate.

To strike or not to strike is the sort of dilemma that keeps presidents awake at night.
