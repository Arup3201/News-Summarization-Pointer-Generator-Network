Jesus Christ once told his disciples that it is ‘easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of God’.

Now a Russian artist has taken the Biblical challenge literally, managing to fit seven of the animals - and three palm trees - in the middle of a needle.

Miniaturist Nikolai Aldunin, 56, works between the beats of his heart in order to keep his hands perfectly still in his Moscow apartment.

Biblical interpretation: Miniaturist Nikolai Aldunin, 56, of Moscow, Russia managing to fit seven camels and three palm trees in the eye of a needle

Tank top: Mr Aldunin works between the beats of his heart in order to keep his hands perfectly still in his apartment in Moscow, Russia

Artist: Mr Aldunin takes his inspiration from a famous Russian tale about Levsha, a left-handed Tula craftsman so skilled he was able to put horseshoes on a flea

His works of art are so tiny that he requires a 28-year-old microscope to see them, and uses tools including superglue, syringes and toothpicks.

Mr Aldunin takes his inspiration from a Russian tale about Levsha, a left-handed Tula craftsman so skilled he was able to put horseshoes on a flea.

However the Moscow artist’s version features not only the shoes - all of them held in place by three nails - but a saddle and stirrups as well.

Wheely impressive: His works of art are so tiny that he requires a 28-year-old microscope to see them, and uses tools including superglue, syringes and toothpicks

His take: The Moscow artist's version of the horseshoes on a flea features not only the shoes - all of them held in place by three nails - but a saddle and stirrups as well

Small weapon: Mr Aldunin's work leads to some frustration - as while crafting a miniature rifle, he lost the weapon's butt after having worked on it for two weeks

But his work naturally leads to some frustration. Once, while crafting a miniature rifle, he lost the weapon's butt after having worked on it for two weeks.

‘I had a sit-down and a smoke and calmed down,’ he said, then decided to start all over again.

‘You mustn't get into a state or worry. Everything that you feel in your soul is transmitted to your hands.’
