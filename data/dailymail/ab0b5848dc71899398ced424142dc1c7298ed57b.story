Ever wondered what it was like driving 100 years ago? Well, look no further.

This promotional video, 'Dodge Brothers' Wild Ride',  from the car manufacturer, Dodge, shows what rural driving was like back in the 1920s.

In short – not very comfortable.

The featured car, named the ‘Oilfield Dodge’, drives through roads swimming in deep mud and pools of water.

The ride looks bumpy, but surprisingly the sedan does not get stuck.

It makes sense why most vehicles in those days were made with SUV features.

The car drives carefree over rocky 
and mountainous terrain and when it flips over on its side, it takes 
nothing more than a few people to roll it back over and, 'vroom', off it
goes.

The video ends when 
the car reaches an oilfield where a group of drillers have struck an oil
deposit, sending black gold shooting through the air next to the parked
Oilfield Dodge.

Muddy roads: The Dodge easily drives through wet and sticky obstacles

Pushing through: The Dodge's wheels are submerged under the mud, but that doesn't stand in its way

Bring it on: Muddy roads with deep crevices were no match for the Dodge

Over the hill: The car drove easily through rocky terrain

Whoops: Ok, so it flipped over... but that was no issue for the driver and his passenger who escaped unscathed

Heave, ho: Just a little push and shove is all it takes to....

Et, voila: The team have no problems flipping it back onto its wheels

Driving sideways: Even with one wheel in the ditch, the car cruised along just fine

Elegant and strong: This Dodge sedan from 1922 could handle both the smooth roads and the bumpy mud tracks

Veteran Dodge: The sedan car from 1928 is tough and sturdy
