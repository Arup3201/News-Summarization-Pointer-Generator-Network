Britain is set to stay mostly dry today as millions of people return to work or school after the two-week Christmas and New Year break.

But mist and fog will cover much of the country except for the North East, with light rain expected in parts of the North West and South East.

And the Environment Agency has 16 flood alerts in place for England and Wales, as well as a more serious flood warning in Keswick, Cumbria.

Forecast: Parts of southern England were shrouded in mist yesterday, but today should see a brighter day before scattered showers tomorrow

Tonight will be mild and cloudy with drizzle in the West - and whilst it will be largely dry elsewhere, fog patches will form, mainly across the Midlands.

But tomorrow, there will be grey skies with drizzly conditions over England and Wales before a band of more organised rain moves south-east.

Wednesday will be more unsettled with heavy rain and strong winds spreading eastwards during the day, with a risk of stormy weather in Scotland.

Meanwhile, today is said to be one of the main days of the year for breakdowns, after many people leave their cars unused over the Christmas break.

AA spokesman Mark Spowage said the first working day in January is 'traditionally the busiest day of the year for breakdowns'.

Mr Spowage, who was the organisation's 'patrolman of the year' for 2014, added that flat batteries were the main culprit.

He said: 'The issue is that many cars get left unused for up to a fortnight in often cold conditions, which causes the power output of the battery to drop.'

Yesterday in Cambridgeshire, the freezing fog and icy roads led to at least 14 accidents, with cars crashing in to hedges, lamp posts and fields.

But motorists will not have to contend with such unforgiving conditions on the roads today with a relatively dry day forecast.

Helen Roberts from the Met Office said: ‘[This] morning remains fairly cloudy with patchy rain in the west.

'[This] will be more persistent in the North West where there will also be some strong winds. The best weather will be in the East. 

'On Tuesday there is a weather front pushing eastwards across the country, which will see a wet and very windy Wednesday.'
