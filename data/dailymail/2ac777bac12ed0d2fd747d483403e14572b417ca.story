Mike Ashley's capture of a Rangers powerbase will spark a fresh wave of upheaval at the beleaguered club.

The Sports Direct billionaire secured virtual control of Ibrox affairs on Saturday after his offer of a £2million upfront loan was accepted by the board to stave off imminent financial peril.

Ashley’s plan, which it was claimed includes the option of a new share issue, beat off opposition offers of aid from Dave King and Brian Kennedy and was driven through by an alliance of Sandy Easdale and Laxey Partners.

Now Ashley can flex his muscles and Graham Wallace, currently on holiday in Greece with his family, will be announced as the first major victim of that show of strength on Monday when he leaves the chief executive role he has filled since November last year.

Former Newcastle United managing director Derek Llambias is in pole position for a top post within Ashley’s reshuffle and, on Saturday night, the name of Ashley’s business associate Stephen Mucklow was also credited with being in the frame for a place in a new-look boardroom.

Ashley has had his sights trained on Wallace since early September in the wake of the announcement that £3.1m had been raised from a share issue as Wallace and finance director Philip Nash blocked his attempts to use assets — including the club crest and the Rangers trademark — as security during talks over a loan in the region of £10m.

In removing both financial executives, who were open to the King/George Letham investment plan, Ashley can use the acceptance of his funding offer as the lever to cement control over the Rangers brand and plant his own men at the controls.

Although Wallace had no intention of resigning, his colleague Nash walked out on Friday, with King musing that the former Liverpool and Arsenal financial executive had quit ‘as a matter of principle against something that is going on’.

Nash departed because he felt the Rangers vote on which offer to accept was going to go against his financial logic. It’s understood that Nash could have stayed on by reverting to his previous role as financial director without a seat on the board.

However, he felt that further Ashley involvement was not going to be healthy for the club.

The £16m King bailout was killed off after key shareholder Sandy Easdale rejected the package in company with Ashley and Laxey. And Sale Sharks owner Kennedy’s late intervention to oppose Ashley with an alternative loan option also failed.

Easdale holds proxy over 26 per cent, including the mysterious Blue Pitch and Margarita Holdings, and refused to back King’s proposal. Throw in Ashley’s 8.9 per cent and largest shareholder Laxey’s 16.3 per cent and that cabal enjoys 51-per-cent control.

Ashley’s Sports Direct stores also have hold over Rangers retail.

It was claimed in quarters on Saturday that the Ibrox side were 48 hours from administration. However, there were three funding options to select from to rule out that extreme measure and it’s understood that one of Nash’s last acts in his role was to sign off the October payroll so there was no danger of Ibrox staff going without their monthly wage.

However, the Ashley loan will only guarantee solvency into the New Year, when fresh investment or creative work on retail contracts with the Newcastle United owner could create extra funds.

Furthermore, the club must then construct a credible case for the accounts to June 2014 being signed off by auditors Deloitte as a going concern in advance of an Annual General Meeting before the end of this year.

It would be no surprise if, further down the line, speculation mounted about the future of Ally McCoist. The Rangers legend is known not to be favoured by influential members of the hierarchy and the removal of two men with whom he enjoyed a mutually-respectful relationship is not a positive for the manager.

Although no official statement was forthcoming from the rival parties to Ashley on Saturday night, there was grave concern and fury among those ranks and of fearful supporters who, more than two years ago, watched as administrators appointed by Craig Whyte handed over the assets of Rangers to Charles Green for £5.5m.

Those close to the opposition camps — the King/Letham alliance and Kennedy — fear that Ashley has effectively seized control of the soul and direction of Rangers for as little as £2m. Some believe it’s inconceivable that the SFA can accept the Ashley deal when other, credible, fully-funded alternatives are on the table, such as the £3m Kennedy loan or the package of £16m put forward by King, Letham and Paul Murray, split between equity and immediate loans, to ease the club through the current crisis.

Supporters’ group the Union of Fans urged the SFA to intervene earlier this month to see off Ashley’s power grab. However, the SFA plan only to write to Rangers seeking clarification regarding suggestions his loan has been accepted with boardroom appointment caveats.

Ashley signed an undertaking with the SFA that he would not own more than 10 per cent of Rangers shares and that he would not exert control and influence over the day-to-day running of the club. However, that was drafted in the post-liquidation days, designed to protect against a block shareholding influence and framed around being in the best interests of the club.

Any bid by the SFA to intervene could lead to legal steps and Rangers could then argue that it is Ashley’s influence that is now in those best interests because, without his funding, they would once again be in dire financial straits.
