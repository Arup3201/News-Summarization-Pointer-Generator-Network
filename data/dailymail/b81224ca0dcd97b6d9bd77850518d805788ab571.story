Binky hasn't had it easy the last few weeks what with her boyfriend Alex Mytton joining the ranks of love rat Spencer Matthews as one of the serial cheats of Chelsea.

However, Binky has proven that she will not let his infidelity keep her down as she appears in singer Stacey Jackson's latest music video - Dance the Night Away.

In the video, Binky demonstrates she is no shrinking violet as she joins a crowded club for an all night dance-a-thon.

During the endurance dance event Binky takes centre stage as she is approached by an overweight man who asks her to dance with him.

Surprisingly, after a brief pause, Binky shrugs her shoulders and continues an upbeat dance with the man but unfortunately doesn't have his same stamina and is given the red card by Stacey - who is a hit on the dance music scene.

The video ends with the overweight man winning the dance-a-thon as he is the last man standing.

Binky seems like a natural in Stacey's 
video, however it isn't just the reality star's appearance on Made in 
Chelsea that has kept her camera confident.

Last January she took to the music industry for the first time, appearing in another of Stacey's video's - Pointing Fingers - with co-star Spencer Matthews.

With the help from Binky that track hit the top five of the UK dance chart  and Dance the Night Away, which samples the hit Flashdance tune Maniac by 
Michael Sembello is expected to get in the top five too.

Clearly making the video had helped to cheer Binky up as she says she thoroughly enjoyed the process.

'Making the video with Stacey was a lot of fun and I really love the track, it’s a great summer feel good party tune.

'There were some amazing dancers on the set of the video, I’m not the best of dancers but I always get on the dancefloor at a party when the DJ plays my favourite tunes.'
