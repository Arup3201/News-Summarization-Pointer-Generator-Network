Keepers at Sydney's Taronga Zoo have named the newest member of their chimpanzee brood.

The name was selected by the zoo's primate keepers and reflects the chimp's Afircan origins.

Taronga Zoo's baby chimp has been named Sudi

All the chimpanzees in the Taronga group have names starting with S. His mother's name is Shiba and his father is Samaki.

Sudi is Shiba's fourth baby and the whole family live in the chimpanzee enclosure with their father Shabani too.

'Shabani and Samaki have shown their softer side since Sudi’s birth, staying close to their mother and monitoring the visits of the rest of the group, ensuring that mum and baby enjoy these first weeks together in relative peace and quiet,' said Lou Grossfeldt the Primate Supervisor at Taronga Zoo.

Cards close to her chest: Mum Shiba, 33, is keeping the baby so close that zookeepers have been unable to determine the bub's gender.

Sudi has quickly become a favourite with Zoo visitors since his birth on 9 August. Keen-eyed visitors will spot the baby’s head or hands and feet occasionally poking out from Shiba’s protective embrace.

'Sudi’s name means success and he’s certainly enjoyed a successful start to life in our chimp community,' said Mr Grossfeldt.

The tiny chimpanzee sparked curiosity after it's birth as it clung tightly to its mother making it hard to figure out it's gender.

Sudi made quite the impression on visitors and zookeepers as he was very chatty letting his fellow chimps know he had arrived.

'The youngster is quite vocal when not dozing in its mother’s arms and appears very healthy,' Mr Grossfeldt said.

Chimpanzees are the closest relative to humans and share over 98 per cent of the same DNA.

The beautiful animals have become endangered in the wild due to poaching and the destruction of their habitats.

Taronga Zoo works with the Jane Goodall Foundation’s Tchimpounga Rehabilitation Centre in the Congo to help rescued chimpanzees.

The new baby chimp will be the youngest of Shiba's four children.

Not letting go: Shiba holds on to her baby at Taronga Zoo in Sydney. She is believed to have given birth to the child on Saturday.

Monkey play: Visitors to the zoo have been promised a better view of the baby in the weeks to come.

Happy chimp: Keepers spotted the newborn baby in the chimpanzee's night den on Saturday morning.

There it is! Keepers have not been able to get close enough to Simba's new baby to determine the monkey's gender.

Sweet slumber: The new baby has some shut eye in Simba's lap.
