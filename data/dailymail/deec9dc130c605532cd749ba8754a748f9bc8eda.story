Reza Barati was murdered during a riot at Manus Island detention centre in February

Papua New Guinea police have arrested two men and reportedly charged them with the murder of an Iranian asylum seeker on Manus Island earlier this year.

Reza Barati, 23, was violently killed and suffered severe head trauma during a brutal riot at the island's detention centre in February.

Acting Deputy Police Commissioner and Chief of Operations Jim Andrews said one suspect, Joshua Kaluvia, was arrested on Monday in Kimbe, the capital of West New Britain.

Another man, 28-year-old Manus Island resident Louie Efi was arrested in July.

'These two suspects will shed more light on the violence and killing and hopefully assist in the arrest of more suspects involved in the February violence and death,' Mr Andrews said in a statement on Tuesday.

The ABC report that both of the men have now been charged with murder.

Mr Andrews told ABC they are still searching for three more men believed to be involved.

Both men are believed to have worked for G4S - the company that managed security at the detention centre when Mr Barati was killed.

Mr Andrews said the police intelligence network showed that Kaluvia had fled from Manus to PNG's second largest city, Lae, before travelling throughout the highland provinces of Chimbu and Mount Hagen.

Kaluvia then made the trip across across to Kimbe, where he was arrested.

According to police arrangements to transfer the suspect to Port Moresby are underway as the investigation into Barati's killing continues.

Security company G4S says it has not been contacted by police about the arrests.

Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said he was aware of reports of the arrest of the two men, although that had not been formally confirmed by the PNG government.

'I do welcome those reports and that news. We have been working very closely with the PNG government and those authorities and we have made sure that we were doing everything at our end to assist,' he told Sky News.

Mr Morrison said the justice process would now have to follow.

Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said he was yet to be formally notified of the arrests by the PNG government, while Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young called for Manus Island detention centre to be closed

'We have confidence in that as we said we had confidence in the PNG police to go and do the job,' he said.

Meantime, Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young called for the Manus facility to be closed.

'Reza Barati was murdered by the very people who were employed to care for him and keep him safe. This cannot be allowed to happen again,' she said in a statement.

An independent review by former secretary of the Attorney-General's department, Robert Cornwall, was told a PNG employee of the Salvation Army had led the brutal bashing of Mr Barati.

But PNG Police announced in May they believed two PNG workers and two expats were responsible for Mr Barati's death.
