Patrice Evra is settling in nicely at Juventus and can't believe the reception he's received by the club's supporters. 

The former Manchester United man left for £1.2million this summer, signing a two-year deal with the Serie A champions.

Louis van Gaal actually wanted the left-back to stay at Old Trafford, but Evra revealed that he'd already made his mind up to depart.

Black and white town: Patrice Evra made his debut for Juventus against the ISL All Stars on Wedneasday

Good move: Evra said he is 'very happy' at the Serie A champions ahead of the new season this month 

He pulled on a Juve shirt for the first time on Wednesday night and had nothing but praise for the club.  

'In all honesty I didn't expect such a welcome from the fans, as I thought that only happened with United,' Evra said.

'Mind you, this is precisely why I chose Juve: because it is a big club like Manchester and gives you the same sensations.

'I am very happy. I thank my teammates, the masseurs, everyone in the staff. They gave me a warm welcome and I already feel like family.

'Today the result was unimportant, but it is always nice to win and score lots of goals. We took this test seriously and are working hard, but the important thing is to be ready for August 30.'

Juventus beat the ISL All Stars with ease, winning 8-1 with Fernando Llorente netting a hat-trick.
