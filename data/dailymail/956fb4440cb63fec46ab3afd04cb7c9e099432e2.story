Botanists are hailing as a success a project to save the loneliest plant in Britain from dying out after they mated it with a partner from 175 miles away.

A rare single female wild asparagus plant was found leading a solitary existence on the Isle of Portland in Dorset in 1997.

The endangered wild asparagus is one of the few plants in the UK that have separate sexes and require a male and female to cross-pollinate with each other to reproduce.

Future's bright: National Trust Conservationist Lucy Cordrey with a female wild asparagus which has now successfully mated after being discovered clinging to the windswept Dorset coast

In 2006 experts found a male variety 
in Cornwall which they carefully moved to Dorset and then rubbed its 
pollen on the female's stigmas.

Her
fertilised flowers then grew, producing bright red berries which each 
contained six seeds. These were then recovered, sewn in pots and grown 
in greenhouses.

After two years, some 60 plants were 
deemed to be strong enough to plant out in the wild where they have 
spent the last five years.

In safe hands: Botanists managed to mate this female wild asparagus, which reached the ripe old age of 70 before it was spotted clinging to the windswept Dorset coast, with an equally lonely male found in Cornwall

Out
of the original 60 plants, 51 are still thriving today and are now on 
the verge of flowering for the first time, meaning they can reproduce 
and sustain themselves.

Joy: The painstaking project to save the loneliest plant in Britain from dying out was hailed a success after botanists mated it with a partner from 175 miles away

Wild asparagus is found in only 28 sites in the UK and its habitat is being steadily reduced, which is why scientists have made the effort to help them.

The plant is different from garden 
asparagus that is popular to eat because it grows flat along the ground 
and its smaller spears have a bitter taste.

The
60 plants were planted in two groups of 30; one at Ferrybridge at the 
eastern end of Chesil Beach alongside the lone female and the other near
to Portland Bill lighthouse.

Bryan
Edwards, an ecological surveyor at the Dorset Environmental Records 
Centre, said: 'We brought up a Cornish boy to have a bit of fun with our
Dorset girl in 2006 and since then it has been a waiting game.

'Because
their natural habitat is in an exposed, hostile environment like sea 
cliffs it has taken the seedlings a bit longer to grow and start to 
flower.

'When they were last looked at 21 out of 30 were still there on the Portland Bill site and they were very healthy.

'We are optimistic that we will begin to see some flowering now.

'To stand any chance of long term survival, a wild asparagus colony needs to contain plants of both sexes.

'Any colony reduced to a single plant is ultimately doomed to extinction.

'We
still don't yet know which sex the new plants are and won't be able to 
tell until they flower. The males have a different size and shape of 
flower.

'But we are 
confident of a mix of male and female plants and then nature will take 
it course and the population will be self-sustaining.'

Success: A fresh young wild asparagus found thriving near the lonely female plant on Portland, Dorset, discovered in 1997 - thanks to the perseverance of botanists' pollination programme

As well as conserving a rare and endangered plant that is IUCN Red List, it is hoped the genes from the wild asparagus could be introduced to the garden variety to make them more draught tolerant.

Other colonies of wild asparagus in Britain exist in coastal areas of south Wales and Cornwall.

They appear to benefit from the north Atlantic drift, the sea current that keeps the south west relatively warm.

The wild asparagus breeding project has been coordinated by various bodies including the National Trust, Natural England.
