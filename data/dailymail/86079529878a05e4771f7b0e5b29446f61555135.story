This spectacular image is the work of an artist who ignites gasoline in mid-air and captures the explosion of flames on film.Â Rob Prideaux, 45, photographs fire and smoke and then creates patterns from the results in his efforts to shape one of nature's 'uncontrollable phenomena'.

The San Francisco-based artist captures the fire in the split second its visible using highly arcane methods, then adopts more modern technology to manipulate his images into mind-boggling patterns.

'Uncontrollable': Photographer Rob Prideaux ignites gasoline in mid-air - capturing the result flames to spectacular effect

'Fire is pretty uncontrollable,' said Mr Prideaux.

'The mid-air explosions have defied all attempts at wrangling so far. The shot with the loop of fire was created with steel plates between the camera to try to shape it,' he added.

Highlights of the series 
include a heart-shaped fireball, three blazing tennis balls hurtling 
through the air and a row of t-shirts burning on a washing line.

Prideaux also creates patterns from smoke by burning incense in the dark and photographing it as it wafts through the air.

Burning: U.S. photographer Prideaux creates stunning images, like this one of t-shirts burning on a washing line, with the help of smoke and fire - and a little Photoshop

Highlights: The artist also burns incense in the dark and forms patterns from the smoke

Blaze of smoke: One of Prideaux's spectacular smoke images, which he creates by 'heavily manipulating' pictures of smoke wafting through the air

Meditative practice: The photographer said the images arose out of dedicating 15 minutes each morning to 'thoughtless creation'

'The smoke images are a more contemplative process of waiting and stillness and are heavily manipulated into patterns,' said Mr Prideaux.

'I began duplicating and combining the smoke images as a meditative practice, dedicating 15 minutes each morning to thoughtless creation, and mandalas began to form, over time.

'From its source as raw material, I've gradually realised the images say a lot about ephemerality and the so-called taming of our natural environment.'

'Uncontrollable phenomena': Despite his fascination with the subject matter, Prideaux describes fire as 'pretty uncontrollable'

Explosive effect: Rob Prideaux uses various methods - including a little Photoshop wizardry - to create his striking images of fire and smoke
