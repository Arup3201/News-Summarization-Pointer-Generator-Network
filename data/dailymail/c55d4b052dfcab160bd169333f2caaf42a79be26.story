Former England star Paul Gascoigne has been admitted to a treatment centre in the United States, it has been revealed.

The alcoholic former Tottenham Hotspur, Lazio and Newcastle United star, 45, has 'willingly' been admitted to the Cottonwood clinic near Tuscon, Arizona, his management company said.

The move came after fears for the Italia 90 and Euro 96 legend following a number of public appearances in which he appeared unsteady and incoherent.

The latest worrying incident came in Bournemouth this morning, when the ex-England player was seen apparently being supported by two burly strangers as he walked through the city centre.

Gaunt: Gascoigne has been seen looking unwell, causing friends and fans to fear for his future

He also appeared unwell and shaking during a charity appearance in Northampton last week, when he broke down sobbing on stage in front of a room full of fans.

In a statement, GamePlan Solutions said Gazza had been touched by the help and support shown by fans and figures within football over the past few days.

The statement read: 'Alcoholic Paul Gascoigne has been experiencing a tough time of late.

'He has been asking for help and has willingly been admitted to a treatment centre in America.

'He has complex issues that are currently being dealt with by professionals.

'Paul has been extremely touched and overwhelmed by the generous offers of help and support over the past few days.

Gascoigne today looked gaunt and unwell as he came out of a mobile phone shop in the wake of increasing public concern for his well-being from friends and supporters.

Two men at a bus stop approached him to shake his hand and offer their best wishes in his battle against alcoholism.

One of the men then held the star by the arm and, along with a waiting taxi driver, helped him walk to his cab.

It was apparently the first time Gascoigne had had contact with anyone else since last Friday.

In a video of a personal appearance by the 45-year-old last week, he repeatedly holds his head in apparent despair and his speech is barely coherent.

It seems his long term battles with 
alcohol and drug abuse may not be over – and that his descent from 
national idol to grim drunken loneliness is continuing.

After
the video emerged, more evidence of his lonely existence was clear at 
his £1,600 a month rented three bed flat in Bournemouth.

Fallen idol: Looking bloated and emotional, former footballer Paul Gascoigne is said to be in desperate need of help to beat his alcoholism after a shambling performance at an after-dinner event in Northampton last week

Troubled: Gascoigne is said to have told the audience he had been on a three-day whiskey bender, prompting some in the crowd to comment they thought the Geordie was 'dying in front of our eyes'

Low: Gascoigne got more emotional as his performance went on and he is said to have burst into tears between abusive tirades against former team mates

Over the weekend, Gascoigne emerged several times, taking minicabs, to buy beer from a newsagent or to cruise the streets, seemingly aimlessly.

Despite growing concern over his physical and mental health, the fallen footballer was apparently alone.

Gascoigne’s shambolic public appearance 
was caught on video in front of a crowd of 500 at ‘An evening with Paul 
Gascoigne’ at the Park Inn hotel in Northampton on Thursday.

Audience members watched as he mumbled stories and swore repeatedly in response to questions from his agent Terry Baker, who was interviewing him for the benefit of the audience.

Gascoigne began by announcing: ‘I’ve had a f****** hard month. F****** hell.’ He also seemed to sob, and repeatedly raised his hand to his face.

While holding the microphone with his right hand it shook so uncontrollably that he had to steady it with his left.

At one stage Gascoigne mumbled ‘I’ve been on a whisky diet’. One onlooker said he seemed to be ‘dying in front of our eyes’.

Mr Baker admitted Gascoigne had drunk at least two cans and a bottle of lager before the event. He said the star needed ‘immediate help’ and was lonely living far from his family and roots in the North East.

Mr Baker said: ‘There is unbelievable sympathy for him out there from the public but he is sitting at his house on his own.’ He implied Gascoigne might need to be sectioned under the Mental Health Act for his own safety. ‘Maybe no one can save him,’ Mr Baker added.

Gascoigne was sectioned twice in 2008. At the weekend he refused to speak to reporters.

Gascoigne was still young when hailed as a footballing superstar – but his heavy drinking meant he was never far from the news pages. He won 57 England caps, and played for clubs including Newcastle and Tottenham before retiring in 2004.

The world of football has shown its concern at the latest troubled period in the life of Gascoigne, one of England's most naturally gifted players ever.

Clarke Carlisle, chairman of the 
Professional Footballers' Association, told Radio 4's Today Programme: 
'We'll continue to give him our full support because that's what we're 
here for.

'We have put 
several people to Gazza and, bar manhandling him and dragging him to a 
facility, which unfortunately we can't do and would do if we could, we 
have put everyone we possibly can across his path.

'We have been in touch with his friends, his advisers, and agents and we will do again.'

Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker admits he is struggling to see a positive outcome for his former England and Tottenham team-mate Gascoigne, writing on Twitter: 'I can only hope he finds peace somehow, but fear those hopes may be forlorn.'

Frank Lampard told today how his 'idol' Gascoigne took him under his wing as a young player.

He told ITV News: 'I was lucky enough to be involved in Euro '96 with him as a kid and he took me under his wing.

'I was completely in awe of his character, how much he was joking around and more than that the quality of his football.

'I've got no message for him now, I don't know enough about it. I've just read and I wouldn't want to read too much into that.

'Whatever anyone says about Paul Gascoigne, he was my hero and he'll always be that.'

Gascoigne's battle with alcohol seemed all too apparent at the weekend.

On Saturday morning he was seen buying six cans of lager in a newsagents before going to a pub.

Yesterday he took two apparently aimless cab rides – throwing a can of lager out of the vehicle on one trip. He was later seen urinating on the balcony of his flat.
