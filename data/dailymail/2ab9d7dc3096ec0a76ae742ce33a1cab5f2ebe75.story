The French magazine at the centre of the topless pictures scandal has ‘more intimate’ photographs of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, its editor boasted last night.

Laurence Pieau remained defiantly unapologetic over her decision to publish the first set of photos in the French version of Closer magazine.

She said the widespread outrage over the pictures was ‘disproportionate’ and tried to insist the shots were ‘not degrading’.

With a smile on her face she even said Prince Harry would feel ‘less alone’ as she compared the photos of a topless Kate to those taken of him cavorting naked in his Las Vegas hotel room  last month.

And in comments which will further distress the Duchess, she said: ‘I won’t hide the fact that there are more intimate pictures that exist.’

The French edition of Closer is owned by Italian media group Mondadori,  the chairman of which is Marina Berlusconi, daughter of Italy’s former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi.

Last night it remained unclear what influence, if any, Miss Berlusconi had on the decision to publish the graphic photographs.

What is certain is that both women will face an avalanche of criticism for what William and Kate called a ‘grotesque and totally unjustifiable’ invasion of privacy.

Instead of showing remorse at the pain
 felt by the royal couple, Ms Pieau gave numerous interviews to TV 
networks in a shameless attempt to justify her decision and sell more 
copies of her magazine.

She
 also posted a series of titillating messages on Twitter saying readers 
could expect the ‘hot Provence version of the crown jewels’.

She added that readers would get the chance to ‘discover very sensual shots of Kate and her husband  Prince William’.

‘What we saw in the pictures was a young couple who are just married, who are in love, who are beautiful,’ the editor said. ‘She is the princess of the 21st century.

‘They are a young couple in love.  She is a young woman who’s topless, just like the ones who can be seen on all of the beaches of France and the world. These are pictures that  are full of joy. The pictures are  not degrading.’

In an attempt to justify the intrusion of privacy Ms Pieau said the Duke and Duchess were ‘on a terrace of a chateau in the south of France which is not far from a road on which cars pass without any problems’.

‘They are visible from the street,’ she added. ‘It’s a nice series which we have a worldwide exclusive on at the moment. These are pictures that will go around the world.

‘And honestly I don’t know of a single celebrity magazine in the world that would not have published these if they had them. They wouldn’t have hesitated two seconds before running. One shouldn’t be hypocritical.’

The editor tried to downplay the furore by claiming that topless pictures of a princess were ‘not  really new’.

In reality, the couple’s balcony was about 1,000 yards from the road and the couple would not have been  visible without the most sophisticated telescopic lenses.

The French version of Closer magazine was launched in June 2005 as a sister title to the British edition, which is published by Bauer Media.

It was sold in August 2006 to Mondadori France, a subsidiary of the Italian company, and now sells around 400,000 copies a week.

French Closer insisted there had been no breach of safety or security in obtaining the photos.

One source at the magazine said: ‘If two public figures chose to strip off in full view of a public road then they can expect to be pictured, and they were.’

Soldiering on: The young Royals had been told about the magazine's plans to publish the pictures just before their first ever visit to a mosque earlier in the day

Last night a spokesman for Mondadori declined to comment.

Bauer Media said it had ‘complained in the strongest terms’ to Mondadori about the pictures.

Chief executive Paul Keenan said his company deplored the publication of the ‘intrusive and offensive pictures’.

He said: ‘Bauer Media and Closer UK regards publication of these photographs as a gross intrusion of their Royal Highnesses’ privacy.

‘We have absolutely no control  over the editorial decisions of  Closer France.’
