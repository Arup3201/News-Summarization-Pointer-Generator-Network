Samantha Beaven's family say they will sell all their possessions to raise the £70,000 needed to fund pioneering treatment in Mexico 

The six-year-old daughter of a woman fighting cancer has vowed to sell all her toys to help raise the £70,000 to fly her mother to Mexico for pioneering treatment.

Samantha Beaven was diagnosed with cervical cancer when she went into labour 14 weeks early.

Doctors had failed to spot the disease, mistaking her symptoms for those of pregnancy.

The cancer has since spread to her brain and specialists have told the 28-year-old the disease is terminal.

But refusing to give in, her family today said they are prepared to sell everything they own, their car, jewellery and toys, to try and raise enough money to fund treatment in Central America.

Six-year-old Bracken said she will sell all her and her little sister Daisy's toys to help. 

The family said they have no choice other than to make themselves homeless by moving out of their rented property, saying it won't be a home without Mrs Beaven.

The classroom assistant has so far responded well to treatment.

But she suffered a fit this morning at home, and scans revealed her cancer has spread.

Revolutionary hyperthermia treatment is not yet available in the UK but appealing for funding on the NHS would take weeks - time Mrs Beaven does not have.

It involves using heat to target cancer cells specifically, liquefying tumours and studies have found it has prolonged life in some cases. 

Family friend Wendy Campling is helping to organize the sale. She said: ‘ They will sell everything they have to keep their mummy for longer.

‘They can live without their car and other stuff but not without their mummy.

‘Sam knows her cancer cannot be cured but with the right treatment she could live to be around for her babies for many years.

‘Both her children need her but Daisy being so very premature and poorly means she needs her mummy more than ever and we will do everything we can to make sure Sam is around to take care of her for as long as possible.

‘She could have years with the right treatment, but it is not available in the UK.’

Mrs Beaven from Brighton had visited hospital 10 times with bleeding and cramping only to be told they were signs of her pregnancy.

It was only when she went into labour at 26 weeks in October 2013 that doctors discovered she had cervical cancer.

She barely had time to come to terms with the news before Daisy was born 14 weeks early weighing just 2lb and 2oz.

The 29-year-old was diagnosed with cervical cancer when she went into labour with her second daughter, Daisy 14 weeks early. She had been to doctors 10 times previously complaining of symptoms but they had been mistaken as common symptoms of pregnancy

Mrs Beaven, has so far responded well to life-prolonging treatment but recently suffered a fit and scans revealed the cancer has spread to her brain. She is desperate for revolutionary hypothermia treatment, not currently available on the NHS

Both mother and daughter were treated at the same hospital but while Daisy thrived after surgery to remove part of her bowel when she contacted  life-threatening necrotizing enterocolitis, her mother’s cancer spread.

She married her daughters’ father Alex Beaven in May last year and was delighted when she responded well to treatment to help prolong her life.

Hyperthermia treatment uses heat to kill off cancer cells.

Used locally, on the tumour itself, the treatment can liquify the disease.

Meanwhile, if used as a whole body treatment, hyperthermia can improve the effectiveness of radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

Localised hyperthermia treatment, or ablatherm or ablation, has been used to treat prostate cancer.

It applies high intensity focussed ultrasound to targeted tumours, liquifying the cells but leaving the surrounding tissues unscathed.

The principle of hyperthermia rests on the fact cancer cells are much more sensitive to and intolerant of the effects of excessive heat than normal cells.

Where it is used as a whole body treatment, patients' bodies are heated to extremely high temperatures, between 42°C and 45°C.

It can be unpleasant so patients are often sedated to allow them to tolerate the heat.

Chemotherapy meant she lost her hair and Mrs Beaven began wearing a bright purple wig to make her children smile.

Scans in October last year showed the tumours in her lungs were shrinking and she felt confident she would live long enough to see Daisy, now one, start school.

Earlier this year the brave mother shared her story with the MailOnline to help raise awareness of cervical cancer and save other lives.

She said at the time: ‘Daisy fought so hard to live that I owe it to her and her sister Bracken to do the same.

‘All little ones need their mothers but Daisy being so very premature makes her particularly vulnerable and I just want to be here to help her father protect her as long as I can.’

She had felt in good health until she was found fitting in bed by husband Alex and was rushed by ambulance to Brighton’s Royal Sussex County Hospital.

A scan revealed the cervical cancer had spread to her brain.

Friend Ms Campling said: ‘We need to get Sam to Mexico for treatment immediately; we don’t have time to wait for the NHS to consider funding her. Time is running out.

‘We need to keep this mummy with her children. They can get another home and another car in the future but they need to save Sam now.'
