Nigel Pearson has underlined Leicester's survival belief but admitted they need to beat Hull.

The Foxes are seven points from safety in the Barclays Premier League and have lost five of their last six top-flight games.

They host the Tigers on Saturday and manager Pearson insists they are out to prove the doubters wrong.

Pearson insists he and his squad believe they can still avoid relegation from the Premier League this season

He said: 'We still have a strong belief in our ability to stay up this season.

'Whether other people share it is not that important at the moment. In house there is a feeling we can do it.

'Saturday is a game both sides want to win. But Hull may be happier with the draw than us. We certainly need to win the game.'

The Foxes have not won in the league since beating Aston Villa 1-0 in January but Pearson thinks one victory could spark a run of results.

'That is something we keep very much in our minds because we do have that belief,' said the manager, who spent just over a year as Hull boss before returning to Leicester in 2011. 'But you have to get that first one.

'This is a game a lot of people see as being a pivotal one we have. It will be a difficult game.'

Dean Hammond (calf) and Anthony Knockaert (personal reasons) are out but goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel could return after four months out with a broken foot.

Matt Upson is expected to control the defence and the centre-back insisted he will remain calm despite their position.

'Personally I don't care about the occasion,' Upson told the club's official site. 'Whether it's a World Cup final or a Premier League game it's the same focus and the same attitude, the grass is green and the ball is round.

'I'd like to use that as extra motivation. I like to think I'm committed to do my best, whether I'm playing for the Under-21s or the first team.'

Leicester have not played since their 2-0 defeat at Manchester City and with a 10-day break between games Upson hopes they have recharged.

'I think it can be quite a difficult, 10 days' said the 34-year-old. 'You can look at it in two ways, it's just important that the players are looking at it in the right way - as an opportunity to prepare for this game.

'It's a difficult period and a lot of thought has to go into training and how much you do focusing on one game, and how much is for fitness and how much is for getting the players in the right frame of mind.

'All those things have to have the right balance and I think it's important to get into the right frame of mind.'
