A multi-millionaire tech-entrepreneur, who was once named one of America’s ‘most eligible bachelors’, has avoided jail time despite allegedly beating and kicking his girlfriend 117 times in a 30 minute attack.

Gurbaksh Chahal, 31, was charged with 45 felony counts over the incident, which took place in his San Francisco apartment in August last year.

Police obtained CCTV which allegedly show Chahal, who ironically describes himself as ‘die hard’, kicking his then-partner in the head multiple times and attempting to smother her.

Multi-millionaire tech entrepreneur Gurbaksh Chahal - pictured on the balcony of his San Francisco penthouse  was allegedly filmed hitting and kicking his then-partner 117 times over half an hour last year. He has now filed a police report against another woman claiming she is obsessed and harassing him

Police were called to Chahal’s Infinity Towers penthouse apartment after a 911-call about domestic violence on August 5, 2013.

Chahal, who made his millions through online advertising startups and currently heads $100million-a-year RadiumOne, is alleged to have threatened to kill his girlfriend several times, according to a police report.

Chahal faced 45 felony charged and two misdemeanour charges based on the security footage San Francuisco police pulled from his bedroom.

The 45 counts also included Assault With a Deadly Weapon (not a fire arm), which in this case is cited as a pillow.

However, as the court case proceeded, a judge ruled the video inadmissible as the San Francisco Police Department had obtained it without a warrant. Chahal’s girlfriend also withdrew her testimony and refused to cooperate

Chahal - pictured with President Obama - pleaded guilty to one charge of domestic violence battery and one charge of battery and was sentenced to just 25 hours of community service, three years probation and a 52-week domestic violence training course after beating his girlfriend in 2013

Eligible bachelor? Police were called to Chahal's penthouse after a 911-call about domestic violence on August 5, 2013, which later saw him face 45 felony charges based on the CCTV footage taken by cameras in his bedroom

In the end, on April 16, Chahal pleaded guilty to one charge of domestic violence battery and one charge of battery and was sentenced to just 25 hours of community service, three years’ probation and a 52-week domestic violence training course.

Despite the incident in August, the recent court case and guilty plea, Chahal remains in charge of RadiumOne, working as a motivational speaker and lecturer and continues to publish 'inspirational posts' on his social media channels.

These have recently included: '15 Things Leaders Never Do', 'If you’re looking for a role model. Don’t look outside, just look inside.' and 'When you want to succeed as bad you want to breathe, then you’ll be successful'.

He allegedly smothered his girlfriend for 20 seconds.

‘She stated she was unable to breathe,’ San Francisco Police Officer Anh Nguyen, told the court during a preliminary hearing last month, San Francisco Business Times reports.

'She stated that he said, “I’m going to kill you” four times. She stated she was in fear for her life.’

Still in charge: Despite the court case and guilty plea, Gurbaksh Chahal, pictured with two promo girls at a bachelor party, has remained Chairman and CEO of RadiumOne, a company valued at more than $500million

Indian-born Chahal moved to California with his family when he was four and founded his first start-up in his bedroom after dropping out of high-school.

Aged 18 he sold ClickAgents, an online company making revenue from performance-based advertising, for $40million.

Four years later, he formed BlueLithium which was one of the first companies to track users online habits to tailor advertising - a system now found all over the internet. He sold id to Yahoo! in 2007 for $300million in cash.

Chahal has also made numerous TV appearances, including a lengthy interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2009, a philanthropic stint on Secret Millionaire and was named America's most eligible bachelor by Extra TV five years ago.

His autobiography, released at the age of 27, is called The Dream: How I Learned the Risks and Rewards of Entrepreneurship and Made Millions.

The San Francisco District Attorney's Office, issued a statement after the guilty plea on Thursday which said: ‘We disagree with the judge’s suppression of the video. The judge’s ruling substantially weakened the evidence we had for prosecution.

‘Though it is not the outcome we had hoped for, the case has reached a resolution where the defendant acknowledges guilt, is placed on domestic violence probation and has to take domestic violence classes.’
