There’s someone leaking outcomes of WWE pro-wrestling matches on Reddit with one hundred percent accuracy.

User Dolphins1925 has been showing up to the website's wrestling fan forum since February with spoilers of all the big pay-per-view matches.

The leaker, who’s now 38 for 38 in correctly naming winners, says he’s doing it to show the producers of the scripted fights ‘how leaky its ship is.’

Uncanny: Starting with February's WWE Elimination Chamber pay-per-view event, a Reddit user has correctly predicted 38 match winners with 100 percent accuracy

Starting with the Elimation Chamber event in February, the mystery leaker has been showing up to /r/SquaredCircle, the Reddit wrestling forum, to wow fellow users with his sharp predictions.

‘I will win this guarneteed. I know all the winners. WATCH. starts in 4 minutes,’ Dolphins1925 wrote on the forum’s pay-per-view prediction series just before the even began.

The Redditor correctly chose the night’s winner.

Since then, Dolphins1925 has returned to Reddit only to predict matches. And he has been on the money every time, always choosing the wrestler who eventually takes the win in each scripted event.

For all to see: Dolphins1925 posts his uncanny predictions in the Reddit pro-wrestling forum /r/SquaredCircle

And with 38 correct predictions in a row, it’s clear Dolphins1925 isn’t just a superfan capable of spotting a pattern now and then.

He’s a bona fide leaker. Though, he doesn’t himself work for the Connecticut-based entertainment group.

‘I would like to clarify once again that I DO NOT work for WWE,’ Dolphins1925 wrote after correctly choosing the winner of May’s Extreme Rules match would be John Cena. ‘I am just a WWE fan like everyone else, and I am getting my information from a source who has VERY credible inside information regarding the outcomes.’

Leaky: Dolphins1925 says he's leaking the the information he gets from a source within the Connecticut-based entertainment company so they'll tighten their ship

As a fan, Dolphins1925 claims he’s out improve the WWE experience, not detract from it:

‘Upper management are not taking reasonable measures to prevent this information from being leaked. These people whom are leaking this information are profiting off it at the expense of the WWE, the fans, and the integrity of the product,’ he wrote. ‘It is for these reasons that I am hoping to put an end to WWE insiders leaking PPV outcomes.’

Since this post, Dolphins1925 had predicted more matches, at the Payback and Money in the Bank events.

Response: Dolphins recently predicted the Payback event results and only last week did WWE respond, saying 'We may have a modern day Nostradamus on our hands.'

The company either wasn’t paying attention or didn’t care enough to shake things up by changing a match’s outcome to make Dolphins1925’s predictions wrong.

That is, Deadspin reports, until Monday.

‘We may have a modern day Nostradamus on our hands,’ WWE told the sports blog. ‘We might have to monitor these posts in advance of our next pay-per-view to see how good he or she really is.’

That next event is next month’s Summer Slam and Dolphins1925 has yet to give his predictions.  Though, when he does, they’re sure to get the most attention of any he’s made to date.
