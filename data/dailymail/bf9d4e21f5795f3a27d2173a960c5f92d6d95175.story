Gentler: The treatment uses a hormone which is naturally produced in the body and therefore believed to be gentler on the body than the current IVF drug

Women desperate to become mothers could soon benefit from a kinder, safer form of IVF based on a ‘chocolate hormone’.

Doctors at Imperial College London are perfecting a treatment that capitalises on the body’s own way of ripening eggs.

They report that 12 babies have been born so far.

This should spare patients pain and discomfort – and also cut the odds of potentially life-threatening complications. The new treatment uses a hormone called kisspeptin, which is naturally made in the body.

It was discovered in the mid-1990s by researchers in Hershey, Pennsylvania, and is named after Hershey’s Chocolate Kisses.

Kisspeptin is thought to trigger the ripening of eggs during normal pregnancies and so should be gentler on the body than human chorionic gonadotropin, a drug used in IVF at the moment.

It is also broken down more quickly, which should also cut the risk  of problems.

Some 53 IVF patients were given the ‘chocolate hormone’ in the study and 12 babies were born. None of the women suffered from ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) which can cause nausea, vomiting and bloating.

Three had ectopic pregnancies – a potentially fatal complication in which the embryo implants outside the womb – but that may have been a statistical blip, the Journal of Clinical Investigation reports.

One of the babies is Owen Harper, whose doctors described the treatment as very promising.

Baby Owen’s mother, Alison Harper, 31, of Hertfordshire, had experienced the discomfort of mild  OHSS earlier.

She said: ‘I went through several cycles of IVF previously but the one in the trial was the least uncomfortable – it was less painful and I felt less swollen.’

The hormone - kisspeptin - was discovered in Hershey, Pennsylvania, and named after Hershey's Kisses

Research Professor Waljit Dhillo said: ‘Our study has shown that kisspeptin can be used as a trigger for egg maturation in IVF therapy.

‘It’s been a joy to see 12 healthy babies born using this approach.’

Some doctors said the trial was too small to be meaningful but Dr Mark Hamilton, a former chairman of the British Fertility Society, said the births are ‘very exciting’.
