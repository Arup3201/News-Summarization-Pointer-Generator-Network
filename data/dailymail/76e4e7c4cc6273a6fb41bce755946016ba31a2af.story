Thierry Henry has labelled David Silva the 'best player at Manchester City' ahead of the likes of Sergio Aguero, Yaya Toure and Vincent Kompany.

The Sky Sports pundit, speaking ahead of Manchester City's Premier League clash against Arsenal, stated he would have loved to have played alongside the Spaniard.

Henry also lavished praise on Aguero, but believes Silva's ability to both create and score goals makes him City's most indispensable player.

'He for me is the best Manchester City player by a distance,' said Henry.

'I may shock people when I say that but he always wants to go forward and he wants the ball all the time. 

'I would have loved to have played with him. He's always trying to be in that middle pocket. He will make his team play better.

'What I like about Silva is that he scored goals when Aguero was out.'

Henry's fellow pundit Graeme Souness warned Arsenal's defenders that Silva will be harder to contain in the absence of Toure.

He added: 'You could see him playing for Barcelona. Silva, without complaining, is usually played out wide when Toure is playing.

'Arsenal will not know who to pick up. Today, you will see Silva getting on the ball and doing damage.'
