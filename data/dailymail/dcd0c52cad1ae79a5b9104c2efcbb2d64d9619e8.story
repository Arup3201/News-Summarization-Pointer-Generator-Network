His clothes and face clearly show the signs of hard toil. One calloused hand holds the top of a long-handled shovel, gently supporting him as he stands on a mound of large stones, whilst the other firmly grips an ancient sickle. You can see that Abdul Hafiz is a proud man, but in his eyes and expression there is great humanity. And hope.

Abdul is one of 30 people featured in a new exhibition that shows Afghanistan through the eyes of the ordinary Afghans who live in the shadow of the war.

From Tuesday 5 November, Thirty years, Thirty stories presents moving, challenging and inspiring images of people who have changed their lives forever with the help of the British charity, Afghanaid.

12 years after the war first broke out in the country, the works have been shot by photographer Leslie Knott.

They are now set to go on display at Gallery Different, Percy Street, London.

'You not only see communities improve, but individuals as well - they become stronger, more independent. I hope my photographs have captured their spirit, pride and determination.'

Leslie’s colleague at Tiger Nest Films, Clementine Malpas, has also created a documentary on the impact of Afghanaid’s work, voiced by Channel 4 News presenter Jon Snow, which can also be viewed at the Gallery Different exhibition.

Mr Snow said: 'This sensitive film reveals the Afghanistan we rarely, if ever, see in news reports. We meet an intricate society which Afghanaid is enabling to prosper and develop despite the backdrop of war. It speaks powerfully of Afghanaid's remarkable ability to work so supportively as equals with the people of the country.'

Afghanaid started working in Afghanistan in 1983 and despite 30 years of conflict and war it has never left and has no plans to do so.

The charity works with local communities in some of the most remote and poorest rural areas, focusing on long-term sustainability to enable development and inspire hope.

Afghanaid’s volunteers and experts have built roads and schools, developed agriculture and rural businesses, improved health and provided access to education for all. Its Head Office in Kabul employs 400 staff, almost all of them Afghan.

He said: 'It is not all about the Taliban, foreign troops or war. This is a diverse and fascinating country, Afghans are people living their lives just like you and me – they want to feed, clothe and educate their families, improve their homes and progress their careers. They are just as aspirational and ambitious as you and I with many of the same concerns and problems.

'So much is being written and said about the withdrawal of UK and US troops, but frankly there was conflict between different groups of Afghans before they arrived and it will continue after they have left. Our work, and the day to day needs of the local communities we work hand in hand with will not be affected by the withdrawal – their and our key concerns are issues such as clean water, sufficient food, small community engineering projects, education and healthcare.' 

MP, writer, former British Army officer and one-time governor of an Iraqi province Rory Stewart OBE famously walked across Afghanistan alone in the winter of 2001.

Staying in over five hundred village homes and sharing the reality of the lives and needs of the people he met during his trek, he holds Afghanaid in great esteem: 'One of the greatest things I found in that country was Afghanaid. I was sceptical, I was doubtful about charity work in Afghanistan, but you just have to see one of their projects, talk to one of the villages where they work, meet their incredibly professional, dedicated, focused staff to see that

Afghanaid represent the very best of British charities – they are the absolute blue chip of organisations.'

His sentiments are echoed by many of the subjects photographed and interviewed for the Thirty years, Thirty stories project.

Abdul Hafiz says his life was transformed when Afghanaid came to his village and showed him and his neighbours how to irrigate drought-ridden land and plant saplings. The resultant crops of alfalfa and fruit had a transformative effect on his life and he says: 'Now I dare to dream, and I hope to expand my land, my garden and my business.'

The happy face of Ustad Ghulam Saki beams from behind the gauze veil of his beekeeper’s hat. 'Before Afghanaid introduced honey bees to Afghanistan we had no idea where honey came from. It was sold in pharmacies, rather than in the market.' He said.

With his village, Baharak, isolated by the then ongoing war with the at that time named Soviet Union, Ustad says that the concept of saving their lives through honey production was 'like a bright light shining through a dark tunnel.'

Trained by another local man, Ustad was helped by Afghanaid to establish his own small colony of bees. That soon progressed to more than 70 hives and today he is renowned for his honey.

He says, however, it isn’t all about the honey: 'Afghanaid’s crucial interventions have helped us to stand on our feet and give us the tools to build our future.' He has set up a school from the funds he raised from his sales and works as a part-time teacher, passing on his knowledge to local children.

'I saw an opportunity to make change in my life. I was trained and provided with a room to weave in and a small almond garden to tend.'

Prior to this life-changing involvement with Afghanaid, Sohira and her family had been struggling to survive in the province of Samangan. With a disabled husband and several children to support, she had been trying to make a living as a cumin harvester, barely earning the equivalent of £24 a year.  

'We were so poor it was hard to believe that things could get worse. When our house was washed away in a flash flood, I prayed to God to take me away. I was the sole breadwinner. We existed on nothing and now we had no roof over our heads,' she explains.

Taught the skills of Afghanistan’s ancient tradition of weaving fine carpets, Sohira’s life and that of her family is markedly different today: 'I am making 28,000 Afs (£305) every six months and can afford medication for my husband and my son. I can send my kids to school and I feel good about myself, knowing that I will never have to worry about how I put food on the table again.'

Sohira’s photograph and story plus those of Ustad, Abdul and twenty-seven other ordinary - yet remarkable and inspiring - Afghan people can be seen at Gallery Different, 14 Percy Street, London, W1T 1DR from Tuesday 5 to Saturday 9 November.
