Next summer President Barack Obama will have a slick new pair of wheels to cruise around Martha's Vineyard on.

An enterprising bicycle company has designed a model specifically for the needs of the U.S. President, in the hope he'll help popularise the eco-friendly mode of transport.

And in a pointed commentary on U.S. foreign policy, Chilean firm Oxford bikes will tell him: 'If we all used a bicycle, there would be no more oil wars.'

Bike for peace: Bike One has been specifically designed by Chilean firm Oxford for Barack Obama and will be sent to him to commemorate the anniversary of the beginning of the first Gulf War

Kitted out: The bike includes a range of features useful to a commander-in-chief, including bullet-proof tyres, a BlackBerry charger and space for the briefcase containing the launch codes for America's arsenal of nuclear bombs

It adds: 'In order to commemorate 24 years since the first Gulf War, we are sending Barack Obama a new presidential vehicle, quite a departure from his Air Force and Cadillac One, we are sending him a machine that doesn't run on oil.'

Oxford has kitted out its Bike One with all the accessories the commander-in-chief of the world's most powerful country might need.

Along with eco-friendly features like dynamo-powered LED lights and an oil-less belt transmission, the bicycle includes bullet-proof tyres, a Blackberry dock and space for the nuclear briefcase.

Last summer, Obama showed his love of cycling when he took First Lady Michelle and daughters Malia and Sasha on a late Friday morning bike ride through the Manuel F. Correllus State Forest in Martha's Vineyard.

On that occasion he was pictured riding the trails on a front-suspension model by all-American cycle maker Trek, but next year perhaps he'll be seen riding his gift from south of the equator.

A website showcasing Bike One shows 
there is a diplomatic and geo-political rationale behind almost every 
feature of the vehicle.

'The
 Bike One is equipped with eight gears to showcase diplomatic power in 
all topographic conditions: both the plains around Caracas and the Golan
 Heights can be comfortably cruised,' it says.

Bike
 One is equipped with puncture-proof Hutchinson Serenity tires which, 
while they aren't really bullet proof, use microcellular foam instead of
 air so they can never be punctured.

'Just
 like with his Cadillac, Obama can stay calm and rest assured there will
 be no suprises along his way, no tacks, no potholes, nothing will ever 
puncture his tyres,' says Oxford.

According
 to the company, Bike One's Brooks B17 saddle - made in Britain from 
French leather - will not only help Obama avoid 'missing his favourite 
armchair near the pool table at the White House', but also 'consolidates
 the oldest and most powerful diplomatic alliances.'

And
 crucially, there is space for to safely house a sturdy briefcase, like 
the one carried around by Obama's party containing the launch codes for 
the America's massive arsenal of nuclear weapons.

'This
 briefcase is made by Zero Halliburton, a company homonymous to Obama's 
predecessor's major contractor during the second Gulf War,' says Oxford.

'This
 briefcase is not only safe and beautiful, but also weather proof, 
allowing the use of the nuclear button without any weather 
restrictions.'

Summer fun: President Obama rides with his daughter Malia during their vacation in West Tisbury on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts last summer. Next year we might see him cruising the trails on Oxford's Bike One

Bike One has been on display in Santiago for several days, but at the end of today - the anniversary of the beginning of the first Gulf War - it will be sent to the White House for Obama's personal use.

Oxford's marketing manager, Alberto Araya, said he hopes Obama will make regular use of their creation while out in Washington DC.

Mr Araya added that he hoped it would 'encourage people into using bicycles and to leave behind other means of transport which pollute, generate stress and are damaging to health.'
