Alongside the image, he wrote: 'Caleb has a brand new baby sister, Dakota. Watson Family is now 4 and we are so blessed! Look forward to releasing more information once our adoption is final.'

He also shared a picture of himself and Angie, 37, on their 'first date night in 12 weeks', during which they watched King James and the Cleveland Cavaliers triumph 98-89 over Orlando Magic.

Watson, who married his wife, a former pro basketball player in Europe, in 2004, has known from their first date that she is unable to have children for biological reasons.

In March 2012, the couple adopted Caleb, then only one month old, after their adoption of a girl fell through. The following month, Watson won his first Masters title in a playoff with Louis Oosthuizen.

Earlier this year, the PGA star scooped his second Masters title, triumphing over Jordan Spieth and Jonas Blixt by three shots. With Dakota's arrival, he could be on track to win his third green jersey.

Shortly after his second Masters win, Watson spoke to USA TODAY Sports about the process of adoption, adding that he was trying 'every day... to get better as a father and husband'.

'When we were going through the process of the adoption, I didn’t know what to expect being a dad. I mean, who wants to change a dirty diaper, you know what I’m saying?' he said.  

Success: In 2012, Watson and Angie - who cannot have children - adopted Caleb, then only one month old. Earlier this year, the golfer scooped his second masters title. Above, he is pictured with Caleb after his win

In good spirits: Also in 2012, Watson won his first Masters title. With Dakota's arrival, some have predicted he could be on track ton win his third green jersey. Above, he lifts Caleb into the air following his April 2014 win

'But now, changing his diapers doesn’t even bother me. That’s my boy. I’ll do anything for him. Caleb has changed my personality, changed who I am, and hopefully made me a better person.' 

Earlier this month, Watson released a hilarious new Christmas rap video in which he assumed his festive-season alter ego named Bubba Claus. 

In it, alongside an elvish crew, he rapped about his golf hovercraft, delivering gifts on a John Deere tractor, his Christian faith and his son's inability to sleep on Christmas Eve.

The song, titled 'The Single', was firmly tongue-in-cheek, with lyrics also detailing mundane details of Christmas in his home of Bagdad, Florida as a child.

His mother, he rapped, was cooking something on the stove, while his father was chilling in the living room as his sister played on the floor. 

Watson is one of the more colourful characters on the professional golf circuit. He is a member of the Golf Boys, a boy band consisting of Watson, Ben Crane, Rickie Fowler and Hunter Maham.

In recent years, he has also heavily promoted his golf cart hovercraft. The vehicle, named the BW1, has been promoted by the golfer as being able to drive through water features and  sand traps.

It is believed that Dakota's adoption is pending paperwork.
