It doesn't take much to get the so-called Twitterati riled up.

Every day Twitter users around the world are virtually guaranteed to get upset about a particular subject and take to the social network to voice their views.

Researchers in China wanted to test how much influence these 'Twitter storms' have on public opinion - and whether this opinion can be easily swayed.

They discovered that not only will a dominant view eventually take over, once public opinion has been set it is almost impossible to change.

Chinese researchers downloaded 6 million tweets and filtered them based on topics. They concluded that public opinion evolves rapidly on Twitter before a dominant opinion takes over. Once this public opinion stablises, the researchers said it was hard to reverse

The research was carried out by Fei Xiong and Professor Yun Liu from Beijing Jiaotong University.

They
 downloaded around 6 million tweets and ran these tweets through a 
computer algorithm to sort them into topics, including tweets about the iPhone 4, BlackBerry and iPad 2.

Each tweet was then analysed to establish the underlying sentiments of the user, and whether these sentiments evolved over time.

Xiong and Liu discovered that public 
opinion on Twitter often evolves rapidly and levels off quickly into an 
ordered state in which one opinion remains dominant.Â 

'Once public opinion stabilises, it's difficult to change,' Xiong added.

Xiong and Liu discovered public 
opinion on Twitter often evolves rapidly and levels off quickly into an 
ordered state in which one opinion remains dominant.

This consensus is often driven by the endorsements of larger groups, which tend to have the most influence.

Since
 public opinion levels off and evolves into an ordered state within a relatively
short time, small advantages of one opinion in the early stages of an online discussion turn
 into a bigger advantage during the evolution of the general opinion, Xiong 
said.

'Once public opinion stabilises, it's difficult to change,' he added.

The public opinion for each topic fluctuated in the early stages of a Twitter discussion, as shown in this chart, before levelling off. Ultimately, the public opinion evolved into an ordered state with one dominant view

However, the work additionally revealed that when 
dominant opinions emerge they tend not to achieve complete 
consensus.

In fact, Xiong said when Twitter users who hold minority 
views are faced with overwhelming opposition, they are still unlikely 
to change their opinions.

This was bolstered by the fact Twitter 
users overall are more likely to want to change the opinions of others 
than to admit to changes of their own.

The findings were published in the journal Chaos, and the tweets were all posted during the first six months of 2011.

According to Xiong and Lui, these revelations could be used to shape how political candidates run their social media campaigns, or influence the way companies market their goods and services.

'By focusing on a network application, candidates or companies can analyse the characteristics and behaviour patterns of their supporters and protesters to explore whether the measures they take can influence public opinion and which opinion may succeed,' Xiong said.
