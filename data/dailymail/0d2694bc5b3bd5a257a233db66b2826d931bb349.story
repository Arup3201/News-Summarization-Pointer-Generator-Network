In celebration of this month's 87th annual Academy Awards, a fashion-loving pastry chef from New York City has created intricate cookie replicas of famous actresses and their iconic Oscar gowns.

Jansen Chan, a director of pastry operations at the International Culinary Center, used sugar paste and cookie dough to duplicate the dresses worn by Angelina Jolie, Reese Witherspoon, Halle Berry, Nicole Kidman, Lupita Nyong'o, Michelle Williams and Penelope Cruz.

The confectionery designs were made in the shape of the stars' specific red carpet poses and included their signature hairstyles and jewelry - with each cookie taking Mr Chan eight hours to make.

Flower power: Halle Berry's confectionery figure modeled the embroidered Elie Saab dress she made famous in 2002 

But the pastry artist didn't stop there.

He also created an edible stage with a red-velvet cake runway and plenty of cookie admirers for his figures.

A video shared by the ICC shows Mr Chan's creations strutting their stuff on the catwalk.

The clever chef paid homage to Angelina's black velvet Atelier Versace gown and leg-baring pose from the 2012 Oscars.

His cookie version of Reese Witherspoon donned a dress likened to the blue Louis Vuitton strapless she had worn to the awards show in 2013.

Meanwhile, Halle Berry's confectionery figure modeled a detailed replica of the embroidered Elie Saab gown she made famous in 2002 along with her red carpet wave.

Mr Chan also recreated Nicole's red Balenciaga dress from 2007, Michelle's canary yellow Vera Wang number from 2006, Penelope's pale-pink Atelier Versace gown from 2007 and Lupita's sky blue Prada frock from last year.

But Mr Chan isn't the only person making edible designs to pay tribute to pop-culture. 

Last December, Martha Stewart created a gingerbread replica of the mansion from Downton Abbey.

And in April 2014, British artist Nathan Wyburn used various crackers from UK food giant Jacobs to make stencil artworks of fashion icons, including Kate Moss, Cara Delevingne and Harry Styles.
