'Cameron and Farrage' shared a hug after appearing in court for stealing from the NHS

This is the moment 'Cameron and Farrage' shared a hug after appearing in court - for stealing from the NHS.

The people involved in the happy coalition, sealed with a kiss and cuddle, were not political leaders - but criminal couple Naomi Cameron and Nicholas Farrage who had both just avoided being sent to jail.

Their offences were all committed at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth in Devon where they stole cash from patients, staff, and the hospital.

Cameron, 24, was given community service after admitting one charge of theft, while Farrage, 28, who admitted three counts of theft, had his sentencing adjourned.

The hearing at Plymouth Crown Court almost descended into farce when one of the defendants was asked to confirm his name was 'Nigel Farage'.

He then had to say he was not Nigel Farage - but Nicholas Farrage.

The judge then stepped in to say: 'I would just like to remind you all that we are not dealing with the leader of UKIP today.'

The duo, who are thought to be engaged, both stood in the dock while details of their crimes were read out.

Alistair Verheijen, prosecuting, said: 'The offences were committed in November last year at Derriford Hospital and the complainants were staff, patients and the hospital itself.'

Cameron admitted stealing a handbag and contents worth £250 from a patient.

Mr Verheijen said: 'The elderly victim had gone out for the walk and left her bag by her bed where she thought it would be safe. 

'She was only gone for a matter of minutes but Cameron came into the ward saying she was looking for her nan.

'She then took the opportunity to steal the handbag.'

CCTV was shown to Cameron who accepted she was the person on it and had stolen the bag. 

She had been taking methadone and could not remember committing the offence but had no other reason to be in the hospital.

Defending Cameron, Ali Rafati said she had turned into an addict after being involved in a violent relationship.

On the day in question, she had taken valium on top of her methadone.

He said: 'She was acting like a complete wild woman, very different to how you see her now. She is stable and sober and looking forward to getting her life back on track.'

She was sentenced to 30 hours unpaid work and must pay £250 compensation.

Farrage was guilty of three counts of theft during the same incident. He stole items from a ward sister and a doctor that were in areas of the hospital not open to the public. He also stole a laptop that belonged to the hospital.

Defending Farrage, Deni Mathews said he had returned to drug abuse to carry out this incident after an 'unprecedented spell of employment and break-in offending.'

'He accepts he has had opportunities in the past but he is motivated more now than he ever was.'

His sentencing was adjourned until February 20 for probation reports and drug assessment.
