Louis van Gaal's arrival at Manchester United has been met with popular approval from the Old Trafford fanbase and the love affair with their new boss has continued following the unveiling of a giant billboard in the city.

Only a month into the United hotseat Van Gaal can now be seen spread across Lever Street in Manchester's Piccadilly Gardens with the caption 'Welcome to Vanchester' on a red background.

The gigantic billboard pays homage to the 63-year-old and seems to indicate the excitement among fans after the dismal campaign last term ,when the deposed Premier League champions finished seventh.

The Dutchman has impressed in his short time at his new club to date guiding United to an unbeaten pre-season so far - including a 3-1 win over bitter rivals Liverpool in Miami to win the International Champions Cup.

At first it was not clear who was behind the 'Welcome to Vanchester' stunt, but betting firm Betfair later revealed themselves to be the culprits.

Harry Phillips, consumer PR manager of Betfair, said: 'We are all about excitement at Betfair, Louis van Gaal's arrival in the Premier League certainly brings that.

'United struggled last season, but van Gaal has given them a real lift and we wanted to celebrate what he will bring to the Premier League, he’s 5/2 to be manager of the month in August. 

'The question is will he have the same effect as when (Jose) Mourinho first took the league by storm.'

It is not the first time that Manchester has been earmarked in this fashion with United's 'noisy neighbours' City famously taunting them about their signing of Carlos Tevez in 2009.

Blue moon: Manchester City famously created a 'Welcome to Manchester' billboard after signing Carlos Tevez ahead of Manchester United in 2009

Tevez was a hugely popular figure among supporters at Old Trafford during his successful two-year spell there before swapping Manchester clubs. 

City wasted little time in publicly celebrating the Argentina forward's capture by creating their own billboard with Tevez which read 'Welcome to Manchester' to the chagrin of those connected with United.

The billboard, which was located near Old Trafford, played on the fact that many City supporters claim their fans are from Manchester, whereas United's are more likely to be found in the south of England.
