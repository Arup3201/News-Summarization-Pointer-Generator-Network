An endangered killer whale who has spent almost her entire life performing in one of the smallest whale enclosures in the world may have only a few more hoops to jump through to earn her freedom.

Lolita's 44 years in captivity at the Miami Seaquarium could be over after officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) placed her on the endangered species list with the wild orcas she was taken from decades ago.

'Captive animals such as Lolita cannot be assigned separate legal status from their wild counterparts,' the agency announced Wednesday, saying the change would take effect in 90 days.

Captive: Lolita, a 7,000-pound orca, has spent almost her entire life performing in one of the smallest whale enclosures in the world, but after being listed as endangered could be set free

Though this would clear the way for activists to petition a federal court under the Endangered Species Act, officials at NOAA cautioned the ruling was not the agency granting Lolita her freedom.

'Whether or not she's ultimately going to be released, or not, is an issue we're not deciding today,' said Will Stelle, administrator of NOAA Fisheries West Coast region.

The 20-foot, 7,000-pound whale has been the subject of campaigns from animal cruelty groups for decades, having been captured from the wild off the coast of Seattle in 1970, according to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA).

The Miami Herald reports that year a group of whale hunters using speedboats and explosives herded dozens of orcas from Lolita's pod into a 3-acre enclosure in Penn Cove.

Lolita, who was originally called Tokitae, was bought for $20,000 and transported across the country to Miami.

Seattle Post-Intelligence reported that Patricia Sykes, a former show assistant at the Seaquarium, recalled Lolita refused to move or swim after first arriving in Miami.

'She just barely floated,' said Sykes, who has also testified in favor of including Lolita on the list of endangered orcas. 'The skin on her back cracked and bled from the sun and wind exposure. She wouldn’t eat the diet of frozen herring.'

She eventually began sharing a tank with another orca, Hugo, from the same killer whale resident community in Seattle, with whom Lolita mated but did not produce offspring.

Hugo had a horrifying tendency to bash his head against the walls and windows of the small tank, and died of an aneurysm in 1980, leaving Lolita completely along in the enclosure.

That tank, a petition to NOAA claims, is illegal because it is 35 feet wide at its narrowest due to a concrete divider that allows trainers an area to stand, though the aquarium claims it is 80 by 60 feet,

'She's been there languishing in a bath tub for longer than
all but one orca in captivity,' said Jared S. Goodman, PETA's
director of animal law.

Though a sale of the park last year to California-based Palace Entertainment gave some hope for Lolita to go free, so far nothing has changed about her captivity.

The Miami Seaquarium has argued in the past that at this point, Lolita would far better living at the park than in the wild.

They cite the case of Keiko, who played the killer whale in the 1993 movie 'Free Willy,' who died in 2003 after being released off Iceland, where he was rejected by wild pods. 

Animal rights groups like PETA support a plan to slowly introduce Lolita back into the water through an enclosure before releasing her to L pod, the group an 86-year-old orca believed to be her mother still lives with, according to the NOAA petition.
