The Queen has formally declared that a future daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will be a princess.

With a long-awaited royal baby due in late spring or early summer, the monarch has issued what is known as a Letters Patent to announce that the couple's baby would become an HRH – His or Her Royal Highness – even if she is a girl.

In doing so, she rectified a century-old anomaly that meant a royal daughter would not automatically become a princess.

A decree made by George V in 1917 stipulated that while a son would become a prince, a daughter would not become a princess.

The king had ordered that the titles 
HRH and prince and princess should be restricted to the children of the 
sovereign, the children of the sovereign's sons, and the eldest son of 
the eldest son of the Prince of Wales.

That means that Princess Beatrice and 
Princess Eugenie automatically had the title of princess at birth as 
Prince Andrew's daughters, but Zara Phillips did not – although her 
mother, Princess Anne, had already rejected titles for her children.

Prince Edward's son and daughter were 
similarly entitled but he and his wife Sophie chose for them to be 
styled as the children of an earl in order to give them a more 'normal' 
childhood.

They are now known as Lady Louise Windsor and James, Viscount Severn. Royal sources said the Queen felt it was time such a long-standing imbalance was formally rectified.

The Queen's proclamation was issued through the House of Lords on December 31 but made public only yesterday.

It reads: 'The Queen has been pleased 
by Letters Patent under the Great Seal of the Realm dated 31 December 
2012 to declare that all the children of the eldest son of the Prince of
Wales should have and enjoy the style,  title and attribute of Royal 
Highness with the titular dignity of Prince or Princess prefixed to 
their Christian names or with such other titles of honour.'

While the announcement is no great 
surprise, it is, nevertheless, an important milestone for the future 
third in line to the throne.

Letters Patent are a form of public 
proclamation and a rare exercise of extra-parliamentary power by the 
sovereign – although they tend to be issued with informal Government 
approval.

Buckingham Palace refused to comment 
last night on the timing of the announcement and whether it meant that 
Kate was now safely past the crucial 12-week stage of pregnancy.

However, well-placed royal sources suggested that the Queen had been keen to make the announcement for some time.

The duchess, who celebrated her 31st 
birthday yesterday, was taken to hospital in early December with acute 
pregnancy-related sickness and has retained a low profile ever since.

Last month  the Succession to the 
Crown Bill was published, proposing to end the system of male 
primogeniture, meaning the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's first child 
would succeed to the throne regardless of gender.
