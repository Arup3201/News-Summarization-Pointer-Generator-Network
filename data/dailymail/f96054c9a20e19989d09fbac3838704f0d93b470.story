Canada has cashed in on the Britain's property boom by selling its Mayfair embassy for £306milion - more than six times the value placed on it just 14 years ago.

The stunning building, in London's historic Grosvenor Square, has been the Canadian High Commission since 1960.

It failed to sell for £50 million in 1999, but today it was confirmed a deal has been struck with an Indian property tycoon.

Desres: Canada's Mayfair embassy has sold for £320million - more than six times what it was put on the market for in 1999

In demand: The super rich are keen to snap up some of London's most exclusive properties, such as the Canadian embassy in Grosvenor Square, as they come on the market

The Canadians sold the property, which
is the equivalent of three football pitches in total size, through 
Savills estates to the developer for £306 million.

But stamp duty on non-residential property is four per cent which means the taxman will get just £12.2 million from the mega-deal.

The 160,000 sq/ft property is expected to be transformed into £1billion apartment block.

Macdonald
House is the latest in a series of embassy sales which has seen 
diplomats moving away from traditional buildings and into 
state-of-the-art new builds.

High finance: An Indian property magnate bought the palatial building for £306m and plans are being drawn up for it to be converted into apartments worth £1bn

It is located at One Grosvenor Square,
one of the world's most exclusive addresses and is a stone's throw from
dozens of Michelin starred restaurants.

Around 20 bidders battled it out to get their hands on the prized asset, which was once the US embassy.

Abhishek Lodha, managing director of 
Lodha Group which bought the building, said: 'The acquisition of this 
marquee asset overlooking London's most renowned garden square, in the 
heart of Mayfair and in close proximity to Bond Street and Mount Street 
is a great opportunity for our company.

'One Grosvenor Square is the best address in the world and we will create a world class development which befits the status of this address.'

The property is the equivalent of three football pitches in total size

The Canadians plan to revitalise Canada House on Trafalgar Square with the sale part of a cost-saving exercise.

Gordon Campbell, Canadian High Commissioner, added: 'There was exceptional interest from international parties for the property on Grosvenor Square.

'We are looking forward to the move to Canada House on Trafalgar Square, Canada's traditional home in the United Kingdom, in the next year.

'We thank Lodha Group for their keen interest and welcome this new phase in the project.'

Over the past nine months, a total of 20 Embassies or diplomacy related buildings have been sold or considered for sale according to Wetherell Estates and Diplomat magazine.

The Brazilian embassy, on Green Street, Mayfair, fetched £40 million, with one agent describing the diplomatic market as a 'goldmine'.

Peter Wetherell, from Wetherell estates, has seen prices for residential properties in the area shoot up over the past year.

He said: 'In Mayfair alone, residential buildings are currently worth at least a third more than office buildings.

'Wetherell recently sold the former Brazilian Embassy on Green Street for £40 million, and this has heightened awareness in the diplomatic community that the missions are sitting on a property goldmine.'

The Nepalese government are understood to be trying to sell their embassy on Kensington Palace Gardens, but this has infuriated the Gurkhas who see the building as a thank you from the British for their war efforts.
