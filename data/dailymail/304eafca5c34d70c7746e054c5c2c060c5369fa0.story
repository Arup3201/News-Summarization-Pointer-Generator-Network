Attacked: Alan Greaves died after being attacked on his way to a Christmas Eve midnight mass - two men have appeared in court accused of his murder

The widow of murdered church organist Alan Greaves was in court today to see the two men accused of attacking him as he made his way to midnight mass on Christmas Eve.

Ashley Foster, 21, and Jonathan Bowling, 22, were remanded in custody accused of murder when they appeared before magistrates in Sheffield.

Mr Greaves, 68, a grandfather, died three days after he was attacked as he made his way to St Saviour's Church, near his home in the city's High Green, South Yorkshire.

His widow Maureen attended the four minute long court hearing this morning and sat at the back.

At a service after her husband's death, Mrs Greaves said she had wept over the 'evil that has been done'.

As she left court with Detective Superintendent Matt Fenwick, who is leading the murder inquiry, she said: 'Justice will be done.'

Asked if her faith was helping her through this difficult time, she replied: 'Immensely.

'The support of the congregation and the police has been outstanding.

'I just want to pay tribute to all they've done, the sensitivity with which they've dealt with the case.'The defendants stood in the glass-fronted dock wearing identical navy blue T-shirts and jogging bottoms.

Bowling, of Carwood Way, Pitmoor, Sheffield, has short, dark hair and a tattoo on his neck.Foster, of Wesley Road, High Green, has slightly longer hair.

They stood with three security guards and spoke only to confirm their names, addresses and dates of birth as well as to state their ages.

There were no applications for bail and they were told they will appear again at Sheffield Crown Court on January 18.

After the attack, Mr Greaves was taken to hospital with severe injuries to his head but did not survive. 
More than 50 police officers were drafted into the inquiry and detectives made a series of appeals for help from the community.

Two other men were arrested in connection with Mr Greaves's murder and later bailed pending further inquiries.

An inquest into Mr Greaves's death has been opened and adjourned by Sheffield Coroner Chris Dorries.

Detective Superintendent Matt Fenwick
 said at a previous press conference: 'Alan Greaves was a church 
organist with a strong religious faith and was on his way to church when
 he was assaulted.

'He was a loving caring husband, father and grandfather who was well loved and respected by all who knew him.'

At a service after her husband's 
death, Mrs Greaves told the congregation of St Saviour's that she had 
felt their love and support since he died.

The Bishop of Sheffield, who attended 
the service, paid tribute to the devout Anglican and lay preacher, 
saying the church had lost a 'shining light'.
