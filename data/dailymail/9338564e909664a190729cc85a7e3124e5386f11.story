Johnny Depp and Vanessa Paradis have split after nearly 14 years together.

The actor's publicist finally confirmed this afternoon the couple had 'amicably separated' despite their repeated denials their relationship was in trouble.

Depp, 49, and Paradis, 39, have two children, 
Lily-Rose, 13, and Jack, 9.

The French-born actress and the American star who famously never married, have not been seen at a public event together since 2010.

Vanessa did not attend any of the promotional events for recent film Dark Shadows or The Rum Diaries, in which he starred alongside blonde bisexual actress Amber Heard, 26, whom Depp has been romantically linked to.

News of the split comes just a month after it was claimed the couple were 'working on' getting their relationship back on track.

According to People tonight, they 'tried for months' with a source telling the publication: 
'They've tried for months to save the relationship but have known for 
weeks that it couldn't be saved.'

The 'Dark Shadows' star recently blasted untrue speculation about his 
relationship being over and said: 'The rumours are not true. They are 
absolutely not true.

'No matter what I say about this, people believe the opposite. I can't say enough about it not being over.'

And it seems that Depp was determined to weather the bad times, making a last ditch bid to save the relationship.

At the time a source told E! News: 'For the first time in a long time, he is talking about her [Vanessa]. They both want to make it work.'

Paradis also denied the speculation and hit out against the claims in TV chat show Le Grand Journal as she promoted her new movie Cafe de Flore.

She said: ''People say we are buying houses in the middle of nowhere, or that we have fifty two houses in France.

'And that is along with saying we split up every winter and get married every summer, and that I'm on my twelfth pregnancy.

'All that is not too serious, but this latest one is a rumour which could cause a lot of harm to my family and my children.'

However, a few months later a number of publications carried 
pictures and reports that Johnny and Heard enjoyed a trip together to 
Las Vegas on a private plane when he was in town promoting Tim Burton movie Dark Shadows.

Again, Vanessa was nowhere to be seen and didn't accompany him on any of 
his promotional duties for the film.

Last month they continued to deny that their 
relationship was on the rocks, but Vanessa was snapped walking round Los Angeles looking rather glum and hiding under a big hat.

Last
week she scowled at photographers as she flew out of Los Angeles under 
another huge hat as she jetted to France for the Cabourg Film Festival.

And ever the professional, three days later she flashed her sexy gap-toothed smile as she joined her co-stars for the photocall for her new movie Je Me Suis Fait Tout Petit (I Was Made Very Small).

And throughout the day she did not 
shy away from meeting people and was happy to sign items for fans, even 
though the announcement of her split from Depp was imminent.

Depp,
48, and Vanessa, 39, got together in 1998 when they met in the Costes 
Hotel in Paris while he was filming the Roman Polanski film The Ninth 
Gate.

He had had a high-profile engagement 
to Winona Ryder and a long-term relationship with Kate Moss and she had 
just come out of a relationship with French-Slovenian actor Stanislas Merhar, having been reportedly previously engaged to singer Lenny Kravitz.

A year after they got together, Depp 
and Paradis's first child, daughter Lily-Rose Melody, was born, followed 
by their son John 'Jack' Christopher in 2002.

In
2007, the family were in London when Lily-Rose fell ill with a serious 
E.coli infection that caused her kidneys to start shutting down and she 
was rushed to Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital.

So grateful was Depp for the care and
attention the staff gave his daughter that in November 2007 he visited 
in his Pirates of the Caribbean character Jack Sparrow to visit the 
patients and the following year he donated £1million to the hospital.

He and Paradis never married but he 
recently stated that having children cemented roots for him and added 
that they gave him 'real foundation, a real strong place to stand in 
life, in work, in everything'.

He added:
'You can't plan the kind of deep love that results in children. 
Fatherhood was not a conscious decision. It was part of the wonderful 
ride I was on. It was destiny; kismet. All the math finally worked.'

And Paradis explained why the pair never felt the need to marry and said: 'I love the romance of "let's get 
married", but then, when you have it so perfect ... I mean, I'm more 
married than anybody can be – we have two kids. Maybe one day, but it's 
something I can really do without.'

In 2010, she also gushed: 'I could make an endless list of 
all the things I admire about him.

'We understand that, if we
want our relationship to continue, we must give each other space, allow
each other to go off on our own, and trust each other. Not everyone is 
lucky enough to be given space and trust.'

Depp is worth an estimated $300million and the family have divided their time 
between their homes in Meudon, in the suburbs of Paris, two in Los 
Angeles, an island he bought in The Bahamas and their villa in Le 
Plan-de-la-Tour, a small town 20 km from Saint-Tropez, in the south of 
France.
