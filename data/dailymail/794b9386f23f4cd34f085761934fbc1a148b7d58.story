Clear vision: Britain's biggest trade union, Unite, has set up a new wing - which can only be joined by the unemployed. The union's leader Len McCluskey is pictured

Britain’s biggest trade union has set up a new wing – which can only be joined by the unemployed.

Tory MPs said it was ‘scandalous’ that Unite, led by the hard-Left former docker Len McCluskey, was trying to exploit benefit claimants for political and financial purposes.

In return for £26 a year in ‘subs’,  the jobless members of Unite Community receive perks including discount designer glasses, advice on ‘claiming the right benefits’ and a  pre-paid debit card offering cashback in high street stores.

The union, which is a key backer of the Labour Party, last month called for the first general strike in the UK since 1926 in protest at the Government’s austerity measures.

Benefit claimants will bear a significant part of the impending public spending cuts, with Chancellor George Osborne planning to slash an extra £10 billion from the welfare budget.

But the recruitment drive could also help to shore up Unite’s bank balance: the union has been shedding members at a dramatic rate in recent years,  losing 262,740 of its 1.4 million strength since 2007.

This decline has alarmed Labour, which has received more than £6 million in donations from the union since Ed Miliband became leader.

A new poster campaign, timed to coincide with an anti-austerity rally on Saturday, will promote Unite  Community as ‘the union for people who aren’t in paid work’.

It claims membership ‘provides a way people can find and use their political voice’.

Other perks include a debit card that offers six per cent cashback at ‘high street retailers’, a tax-refund service – under which the union checks whether the member has overpaid tax when in work, and takes a cut of any refund – and a ‘welfare benefits check-up’ to target the ‘millions of pounds per year that goes unclaimed by  people who are entitled to benefits’. 

Members are also entitled to discount vouchers from Vision Express, and can get deals including ‘designer 2-for-1 glasses’.

Those who find work again no longer qualify to belong to Unite Community. If they then switch to full membership of the union, it will cost them £132 a year.

Last night Tory deputy chairman Sarah Newton said: ‘It is scandalous that Labour’s largest donor, Unite – which backed Ed Miliband for the leadership – is looking to politically mobilise the unemployed and plug its falling membership subs.

‘The public expects trade unions to protect the rights of their members in the workplace – not try to fill gaps in their funding off  the back of the unemployed. Is  Ed Miliband really comfortable taking money from a union that  is acting in such a cynical way?’

A Unite spokesman said last night: ‘I am surprised that the Tories  are opposed to us trying to help people to get back to work. 

‘This is an effective way of  giving unemployed people  and students the access to financial and employment advice, which they lack.

‘It is complete nonsense to suggest that we are trying to “mobilise” benefit claimants for political purposes, or as a new way to fill up our coffers.’
