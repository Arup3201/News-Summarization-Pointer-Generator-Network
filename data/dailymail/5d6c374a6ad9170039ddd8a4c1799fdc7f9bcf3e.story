A 21-year-old fan of street stunt craze parkour was killed after hurling himself off a 120ft-tall bridge in southern China.

Wang Zijian drowned after hitting the water at high speed in Luzhou, Sichuan province, in a Parkour-style stunt - which he had asked his friends to film.

The craze - where fans perform acrobatics in urban settings like balconies and high buildings - has become a huge hit after appearing in action films like James Bond and The Bourne movies.

Tragedy: Wang Zijian - a daredevil fan of street stunt craze parkour - died when he hurled himself off a 120ft bridge and asked friends to film him

Impact: The 21-year-old drowned in the Tuojiang River after the force of the impact on the water knocked him unconscious

'He said he had a very strong feeling he could pull off this jump so
he called all his friends and told them to meet him at the bridge,' 
said one friend.'

'When we got there he gave us his phone and told us to 
keep filming,' they added.

But Mr Wang drowned in the Tuojiang River 
after the force of the impact on the water knocked him 
unconscious.

'He came to for a while and started swimming but then 
disappeared under the water and was not seen again,' according to a police spokesman.

Risk: Mr Wang had apparently asked his friends to film him before leaping from the bridge in Sichuan province

Doomed: He gestures to onlookers as he prepares to make his doomed leap from the bridge

Authorities have raised concerns about the risk in jumping across high buildings and off of bridges as part of the parkour craze and argue that practitioners are needlessly risking damage to both themselves.

But many practitioners of Parkour
insist the non-competitive sport is not dangerous as long as it is 
practiced properly and safety procedures are put in place.

There
have been several deaths across the world which are understood to have 
been related to the sport, but it can be difficult for authorities to 
determine whether they are suicide attempts.

Efforts are being made in different parts of the world to create safe places for fans to take part in parkour.

However, some fans believe this will detract from the freedom of the sport. Parkour features in films and in video games, sparking further worldwide interest.

FreerunningÂ  is believed to have developed from parkour and includes combinations of gymnastics or acrobatics moves.

In June last year a 24-year-old plunged 17 storeys to her death during her first parkour lesson.

The accident happened when she was trying out the sport which requires participants to jump, climb and roll across buildings.

St Petersburg police said the woman, went up to the 
roof of the building with her older sister, along with four local men, who were
apparently experienced in the craze.
