The head of the Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) said Friday that underwear bombers are still a concern.

Speaking at the Aspen Security Forum, TSA chief John Pistole said al Qaeda has retooled its underwear bomb designed to take planes down over the United States.

Airport security systems had to be modified after a double agent discovered exposed the second iteration of the device last year, Pistole said during a question and answer session moderated by ABC reporter Brian Ross.

Uncovered: TSA honcho John Pistole spoke in detail about 'Underwear 2,' the next generation of underwear bombs from al-Qaeda designed to being down planes over the U.S.

TSA equipment ‘wasn’t calibrated to detect [the device], and all of our 800 bomb-sniffing dogs had not been trained for that specific type,’ Pistole said of the recently-discovered bomb.

Designed to create an explosive cocktail by mixing two liquids with separate syringes Pistole called a ‘double initiation system,’ the security chief explained that ‘Underwear 2’ is a ‘new and improved’ device that has the potential to be much more effective than the first underwear bomb, which failed to detonate when Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab attempted to up a plane on Christmas Day, 2009. Instead of damaging the plane, the bomb instead severely burned the would-be terrorist’s groin, according to reports.

Gotcha!: Said Al-Shehri, a Saudi second-in-command of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) was killed in a U.S. drone attack in Yemen, AQAP said on July 17, 2013

The additional use of household caulk sealed the explosive device, keeping vapors from detection by bomb-sniffing dogs or TSA equipment, Pistole added.

The TSA honcho attributed the more advanced bomb to Yemeni bomb making expert Ibrahim al-Asiri, an alleged member of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.

After Ross referred to al-Asiri’s new bomb as ‘our greatest threat,’ Pistole agreed, saying ‘all the intel folks here [at the forum] know that is a clear and present danger.’

Yemeni authorities announced Thursday that Said al-Shehri, the deupty head of al-Qaeda in Yemen, was killed in a drone strike in the country, according to reports. In admitting his death, al-Qaeda claimed the fallen leader became lazy with his use of cell phones, making him an easy target.
