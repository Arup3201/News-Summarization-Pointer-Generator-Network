A Michigan couple who vanished from their home with their newborn nearly a month ago have got in touch with relatives to tell them that they are safe but do not want any contact.

Police initially said it looked like something had 'spooked' the couple from the small town of Petoskey, Michigan, as they appeared to abandon their successful cleaning business 
and leave in the middle of packing leaving clothing, computers, food and 
paperwork behind.

But Timothy Medsker, 33, wife Sabrina, 34, and baby son Joshua, who were last seen on February 12, have contacted family members to let them know that they are safe.

Mystery: Timothy Medsker, wife Sabrina and four-month-old son Joshua haven't been seen in their home town of Petoskey, Michigan since February 12

Vanished: The couple, pictured, from the small town of Petoskey have apparently abandoned their successful cleaning business and left in the middle of packing

Petoskey Department of Public Safety Det. David Schultz told Fox News that Mr Medsker called his sister on Wednesday afternoon and said he and his family were fine, but offered no explanation as to why they left their home and gave no clue as to where they were.

'Timothy and Sabrina are very private people and it seems the media pressure made them come forward. They said that they're fine and that they don't want to have any more communication.' he said.

Police officers gave no further details about the couple's disappearance, saying their location, and motivation for leaving, was still unclear. They added that they would be closing their investigation.

Although there was no evidence of foul play, the police had launched an investigation into the disappearance prompted by the concern of their relatives.

Medsker's sister, Kelly Mantati, said her brother gave no reason as to why they abruptly left their home without warning, she told ClickonDetroit.com.

'He does have a different way of thinking than maybe you and I would, so maybe he feels with the economy being as bad as it is, that he needed to leave. I honestly, I'm not sure.'

The family say nothing seemed out of the ordinary with the couple who had been talking about plans to attend a baby shower

Police searched the home a 
second time this week before they made contact and took computers and personal papers  for clues 
about what happened to the family.

'All
of their personal belongings were there including clothing, computers, 
food, paperwork – it looked like something spooked them,' added Schultz.

Schultz told Fox that the couple's finances were not believed to be a concern, as their bills were all up to date.

'They had a very successful small business in town cleaning offices and businesses,' he said.

Mr Medsker, who was known to work 70 to 80 hours a week, had failed to show up for client meetings on February 16.

Relatives reported the family missing on
February 23 after being contacted by concerned customers. The Medskers,
who were described as 'very private', reportedly have family in 
Orlando, Florida.

The family had said nothing seemed out of the ordinary with the couple who had been talking about plans to attend a baby shower.

Mr Medsker's mother, Laura Medsker, had made a desperate appeal to the couple via ABC News on Wednesday urging them to get in touch.

'We love you and we love Joshua. Please just call somebody or write or email. Please let us know you guys are ok, we're so worried about you.'

The town of Petoskey has a population of around 6,000 and sits on the northeast shore of Lake Michigan.
