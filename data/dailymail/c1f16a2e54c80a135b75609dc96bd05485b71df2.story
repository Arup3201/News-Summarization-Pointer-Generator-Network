Meet Switzerland's very own Father of Christmas.

Johann Wanner counts the White House in Washington DC and the residence of the Monaco royal family as just two of the world's venues he has decorated in his unique Christmas style.

The 78-year-old owns two shops in Basel, Switzerland – one he opened in 1969 and the other, due to increasing demand he set up two years ago.

From angels to candles, action figures to desserts, Johann Wanner's shops cater for every seasonal taste

As well as his units selling everything you could ever dream of in terms of decorations, every one made by hand, it is the styling of Christmas trees that have seen him achieve worldwide kudos.

What's more, Wanner's flagship grottos are open all year round.

'The way we celebrate Christmas is a mirror of society,' Wanner told MailOnline Travel.

Only 5 per cent of the world's Christmas decorations are handmade.

All Johann's decorations sold in his shops are handmade – highlighted by the fact that the shape of each are 'not perfect,' in his own words.

Johann states green and red are the most popular colours of his UK clients.

Basel's main Christmas tree outside the cathedral was designed by Johann, who used the surrounding architecture to sculpture his art.

'In summer we do Christmas because we have people who come from all over world.

'Christmas stays all year long. Union Jack decorations, Stars and Stripes, liberty balls, candy sticks, all made by hand, are wanted by people from all over.'

While his shops are full of Christmas goodies that make even the discerning adult wide-eyed with excitement, it is his tree decorating that provides the greatest stories.

Wanner is coy about revealing the identity of his clients, but as well as his trips to the White House being common knowledge, he has an interesting tale of a royal visit.

'One year I was called to decorate the royal family of Liechtenstein, I had to find out about the house, about the size of the room, the colours, everything.

'It was a fabulous scene, so much so that I was out playing golf with the head of the Liechtenstein royal family the next day.'

The window of Johann's shops is enchanting; and this is notched up a level once inside

At this point, I asked how the course were over there, and was told that he would 'be able to arrange me a round,' should I ever be visiting.

Not a bad addition to the contacts book.

Wanner likens his role to that of a fashion designer – no time limit can be put on on decorating a tree, and much research goes into every project.

'It take lots of time,' added the passionate Swiss.

'People ask me how long it takes, I say an eternity. The important thing is to give yourself time to make it correct.

Johann is well known not only and Basel and Switzerland, but also throughout the world for his Christmas decorating masterclass

'From 0-95 per cent is easy. The last five per cent takes the same amount of time as the first 95.

'We work with the decorators of the famous people, there is a network of decorators worldwide. 'They send us descriptions of the people, or they send us colours and pieces of leather of the interior, and so the style we must know.

'My work is the same as like a fashion designer. The work is just the same. We have the natural colours, red, blue, green, gold and silver. But every year there are new colours, everything changes.'

Johann Wanner is without doubt the 'Couturier of the Christmas tree' – the tree is the model and the decoration the fashion. And Wanner is the genius behind each operation.
