The government is issuing the regulations needed to allow gay couples married in states that recognize same-sex marriages to file joint federal tax returns.

Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said the new rules would provide 'clear, coherent tax-filing guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide'.

Mr Lew said the regulations also make clear that legally married same-sex couples will be able to move freely throughout the country and their federal tax filing status will not change.

The new rules implement the tax aspects of the Supreme Court's ruling in June which invalidated a section of the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act.

The new regulations from the Treasury and IRS implement the court's decision on how legally married same-sex couples should be treated for federal tax purposes.

Now, even if a gay couple live in a state that does not recognize gay marriage, they will be recognized under federal law as long as they were married in a state that permits same-sex weddings, according to Business Insider.

'Todayâ€™s ruling provides certainty and clear, coherent tax filing guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide. It provides access to benefits, responsibilities and protections under federal tax law that all Americans deserve,' Mr Lew said.

'This ruling also assures legally married same-sex couples that they can move freely throughout the country knowing that their federal filing status will not change.'

Inequality by those in same-sex relationships has led to some couples taking extreme measures to ensure their loved ones are protected.

In June, a Pennsylvania man adopted his partner of 44 years to circumvent high property taxes that would be imposed on either of the men if the other dies.

John, 65, and his 75-year-old partner made the decision to become father and son to avoid a 15 per cent tax on any property and assets willed to one if the other should die - a much higher tax than married spouses or family members are required to pay.

Pennsylvania only recognizes marriage
as being only between a man and a woman and has no provision for civil 
unions at this time.

And, in 2011, a Massachusetts city began paying gay employees a stipend to offset an unequal federal tax.

The
city of Cambridge made the change when it discovered gay school and 
city workers who chose to put their spouses on their employer-provided 
health insurance were paying more because of federal government taxes.

As a result, Cambridge began to pay public employees a stipend to defray the cost of the federal tax.

The city employees hit by the extra tax paid an additional $1,500 to $3,000 in taxes a year and officials estimated the stipends would cost the city an additional $33,000.

'This is about equality,' Marjorie Decker, a Cambridge city councilor, said at the time. 'This is a city that models what equality really means.'
