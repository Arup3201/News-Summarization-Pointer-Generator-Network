The model who stripped naked at the AFL grand final has revealed her parents were not impressed and says she will write a formal apology to league officials.

Heather McCartney has blamed the free alcohol bar for her raunchy antics that shocked fans following Hawthorn's big win over the Sydney Swans on Saturday.

The 26-year-old Scottish model told Seven News: 'We were just playing around and everyone was betting silly things so I decided to bet, if Hawthorn win, then I'll get naked.'

After receiving complaints, police arrived to arrest the Gold Coast woman but she lashed out, kicking, punching and biting the officers as they tried to handcuff her.

McCartney, who has over 250,000 fans on Facebook, was a last-minute guest with a friend in a corporate box on Saturday.

Seven News reports that McCartney threw her underwear out the window when Tom Jones was performing before the match.

Shortly after the final siren, she took off her dress and performed a naked display of celebration, which she now admits was a big mistake after she woke up on the floor of a police cell.

'I just pretty much went up to the window, turned around, walked away and put it back on,' she said.

'People around me were in absolute shock.'

McCartney said she and her new media manager Ricky Nixon will deliver the handwritten letters of apology to the Melbourne Cricket Club and the AFL on Friday.

'I'm going to write to Gillon McLachlan and Mark Anderson, saying 'I'm sorry',' she told Seven News.

'I'm sorry for any conflict and embarrassment I've caused them and everyone.'

McCartney also added that she had to apologise to her parents who live on the Gold Coast.

'They're not impressed, put it that way,' she said.

Tom Steinfort tweeted a photo of Heather McCartney, naked in a corporate box at the MCG, captioning the snap: 'Celebrating your team winning the grand final by getting nude in a corporate box... priceless'

Melbourne Cricket Ground and the AFL have launched an investigation.

A representative from the building company denied hiring Ms McCartney as the AFL announced they were investigating the incident.

'Edgeton Properties did not hire a stripper to perform in a corporate suite at the MCG Grand Final,' the company told the newspaper in an email.

It's not yet known if the company was using the corporate box during Saturday's game, or if it had leased it out.

The company would not comment on who was using the corporate box  and how Ms McCartney came to be naked when the game ended.

Ms McCartney denies being a stripper and claims she was dared to strip off if the Hawks won.  

The AFL fan has also been revealed to be a rugby league supporter, although it is unknown whether she will support the Rabbitohs or the Bulldogs during this weekend's NRL grand final

It comes as several photos emerged of Ms McCartney in various sporting attire, with the model posting several racy snaps of herself online wearing a Queensland NRL State of Origin jersey.   

Other photos show her wearing a Socceroos jersey, various Australian-themed swimsuits, baseball themed shoots and most recently, both Sydney Swans and Hawthorn Hawks-themed lingerie ahead of her notorious antics.

Ms McCartney was arrested by police following complaints at the MCG.

She reportedly lashed out by kicking, bunching and biting the officers as they tried to handcuff her. 

The 26-year-old was photographed being led away by police where she spent the night in a cell and was fined $300 for indecent manner. 

She told a Melbourne court the following day that it was a bet. 

Ms McCartney was seen leaving court on Sunday morning, holding a clear plastic bag of her belongings, including her clothes, shoes and make up. 

She was wearing black tights and a dark grey knitted jumper and had no shoes on at the time.

A post on her Instagram revealed that Scotland-born McCartney was supporting Australian football team, the Socceroos during this year's World Cup

Ms McCartney posted a raunchy photograph of herself, with her hair in pigtails, wearing just a yellow bikini top and dark bottoms and a red AFL ball in one hand on Monday morning.

She captioned: 'What a weekend! Had a blast with my girl. Melbourne.'

One man who claimed he was in the box during the stunt said Ms McCartney was hired for the day and was promised double pay if she 'got naked and cheered in front of everyone'.

Despite receiving messages of congratulations on Facebook, the incident has angered officials at the MCG, who have launched an investigation.

MCG spokesman Shane Brown told the Herald Sun it would work with Victoria Police and the client to establish the circumstances and appropriate action would be taken.

'From the evidence available, we are very disappointed ... and are taking the matter seriously,' he said.

An AFL spokesman said they were also awaiting on information from the MCC regarding the investigating. 

AFL Fans Association spokesman Brian Clarke said he was disgusted by the return of the 'blokey culture' to AFL.

'It's a disgrace. It's the people's game and it's for families,' he said.

'This goes against everything the AFL has been trying to achieve. I hope the AFL come down hard on those who were behind this.'

Scott Evan said: 'Awesome show yesterday!' 

Michael Coyte said: 'well done darling'
