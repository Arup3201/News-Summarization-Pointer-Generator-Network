Reverend George Gebauer has described homosexuality as a 'medical issue' saying there was a hormone imbalance

A CHURCH of England vicar refused to christen a baby boy because his lesbian parents both wanted to be registered as his mother.

Aimi Leggett, 25, and her civil partner Victoria, 22, had hoped to welcome  one-year-old Alfie into the church with a traditional christening.

But Reverend George Gebauer told them it was ‘impossible’ for him to have two mothers – forcing his archdeacon to intervene and give permission for  the  service to go ahead.

The 87-year-old from St Mary’s Church in Warsash, Hampshire – who says he ‘feels sorry’ for gay people because they are medically ‘imbalanced’ – refused to conduct the ceremony claiming it could be ‘illegal’ to proceed in the way they wanted.

The couple stormed out of the meeting after the vicar suggested that one of  them should be listed as godmother instead because the baptism certificate only has space for one mother and one father. Alfie’s birth mother Aimi said: ‘There was no way one of us was going to be listed as the godparent. We are both Alfie’s mum.

‘Rev Gebauer sat there and told us no child could have parents of the same sex, no child could have two mothers.

The couple wanted St Mary's Church to recognise them both as parents to one-year-old Alfie

‘He did this for about ten or 15 minutes and was asking us why we want Alfie brought into the church.’
She added: ‘I’m baptised Church of  England and Victoria is a Catholic. 
We want him to be brought up [Christian] the same that we have been.

‘We were even saying to the Reverend:
 “Do you want Alfie to be ashamed of his family?” He’s not gay, we are, 
what we do is up to us.’

 Victoria, who live in the nearby town of Fareham, had initially 
organised the baptism with Rev Andy Norris – who has since moved away 
from the church.

Retired vicars, including Rev Gebauer, are now officiating until a replacement can be found.

The pair had chosen St Mary’s as Aimi
 herself was baptised there and her parents married there. Rev Gebauer, 
who has been a vicar for 40 years, claimed the couple’s sexuality was 
not an issue and that he had been willing to baptise Alfie if they 
agreed to record just one of them as mother.

The vicar, who lives in a £350,000 
bungalow in the nearby village of Locks Heath, added: ‘They insisted 
they both be registered as mum and refused to budge from their position.
 They will not give way and that can’t happen. Their sexuality has no 
bearing on the issue. It was never discussed. The church baptism 
register makes no provision for it.

‘We have bent over backwards to try 
and accommodate this family. I believe it would be illegal for me to 
register them both as mother.

'Impossible': Rev Gebauer said there was not the space in the Church of England register for two mothers

‘The soul of the little boy is more important than anything else but we have a stalemate.’

Victoria said the couple, who both 
wore white dresses on their wedding day in 2011, were upset and shocked 
by their treatment. She added: ‘It’s so hard not to be put off by our 
experience.

‘You get told “yes you can do it” and then that all changes and they completely disregard it. 
‘You do not expect a little, frail, old man to say this.’

However, in a last minute u-turn the Archdeacon of the Meon, the Ven Gavin Collins, intervened in the row last night.

He confirmed that the christening can go ahead without Rev Gebauer – with both women named as mother on the certificate.

He said: ‘Having spoken to Aimi Leggett, I’m pleased to report that the baptism of Alfie will go ahead at St Mary’s Church.

‘We have addressed the legal issue. 
As I understand it, her partner Victoria has full legal co-parental 
responsibility for Alfie.

‘We will therefore be able to enter their details on to the baptism register as mother and mother, as they would like.’

He added: ‘I’m pleased that this 
issue has been resolved, and we are looking forward to welcoming Aimi, 
Victoria and Alfie, as well as their friends and family.’

Aimi’s mother, Donna Leggett, 44, 
said: ‘Somebody from the church phoned to say sorry and to say the 
baptism can go ahead. It’s great news but it should never have got to 
this stage in the first place.’
