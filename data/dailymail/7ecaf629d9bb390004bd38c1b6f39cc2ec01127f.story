Left to die: Buck was found in a garbage bag that had been tied to a fence post

Dire: Buck was rushed to the Animal Emergency Clinic of Conroe, where vets determined he had been shot in the face with buckshot

The bulldog had been bundled into a garbage bag and tied to a fence post in Conroe, Texas, with blood seeping from his wounds.

Augustyn said that when a neighbor opened the bag, the dog staggered out and walked a few steps before collapsing.

She rushed Buck to the Animal Emergency Clinic of Conroe in West Dallas where vets determined he had been shot in the face with buckshot, shoved into a garbage bag, and left along the road to die.

The three-year-old dog was also suffering from hypothermia having spent the night suffering in the cold.

Permanent damage: Buck will most likely remain blind as a result of being shot in the face

Injuries: Buckshot was lodged in the dog's face, neck, shoulders, mouth, gums and in his eyes

Hugs: Buck was also suffering from hypothermia having spent the night suffering in the cold before he was found by Ms Augustyn

Buck, as the dog has been named, had buckshot lodged in his face, neck, shoulders, mouth, gums and in his eyes.Â 

Dr Ron Hendrick, a Veterinarian with Animal Emergency Clinic of Conroe, said Buck would most likely remain blind as a result of being shot.

He also said Buck shows signs of hearing loss and may have sustained brain damage that affects his mental capacity.

A Facebook page launched to raise funds for the estimated $5,000 medical bills quickly attracted over 1,500 users.

Well wishers flooded the 'Buck Needs Bucks for his Buckshot Injuries' with offers of cash and outrage at his shocking injuries.
