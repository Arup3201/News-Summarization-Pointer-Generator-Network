A Good Samaritan who took down a would-be ‘armed’ bank robber in Orange County, California, on Tuesday with his bare hands is struggling to pay the medical bill for his injuries.

Herb Pearce, a termite exterminator, was at a Chase Bank branch in Fullerton when he noticed a man acting oddly.

‘(He said), “This is a robbery! This is a stick-up! I want all your money right now!’” said Pearce. ‘I’m looking at this guy, thinking, “Is this guy for real!?’”

Pearce said the man claimed to have a gun and pointed it right at him.

‘He had his hand in the plastic bag,’ he told CBS2. 

Pearce then grabbed the suspect’s arm and called his bluff.

‘Pow! I clocked him. He went back a little bit, he came at me again, I hit him again,’ he said. 

Police said 29-year-old suspect Jacob Williams was not armed and was arrested on the spot.

Pearce broke and fractured his hand in several places taking the suspect down.

Pearce told reporters that Williams attempted to hold up the branch by claiming he had a gun when it was simply his hand in a plastic bag

Despite having no health insurance and not knowing how he’ll pay to get his injury treated, Pearce said he has no regrets about stepping in.

‘I’ll be darned if some junkie is gonna come off the street and take my (money). I put too many hours to get that… paycheck. So I’m not gonna let him take my money,’ said Pearce.

Pearce has asked Chase to pay his medical bills, but he said the bank refused because their insurance provider doesn’t cover it.

A spokesperson for the bank told CBS2 that they’re still looking into the incident.
