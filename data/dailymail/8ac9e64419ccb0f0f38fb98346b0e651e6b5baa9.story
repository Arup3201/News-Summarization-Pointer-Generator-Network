Senior officials in the Bill Clinton White House got rid of intern Monica Lewinsky in 1996 as her affair with the president heated up, shuffling her off to the Pentagon in a move that ultimately backfired. 

By 1996 West Wing staffers had started to refer to Lewinsky as 'the stalker' since she was around the Oval Office more than any intern would normally be.

Top administration officials were instructed to find her a federal government job outside the White House, according to a document made public Friday by the Clinton Presidential Library.

Lewinsky would get her transfer, meeting civil servant Linda Tripp at the Defense Department and launching the friendship that would lead to recorded phone calls, leaks, and a presidential impeachment.

Monica Lewinsky has lived in London for much of the 17 years since she left the public eye (shown here in June 2014), but her infamous name has made employment and personal relationships elusive

In this April 1996 email, the Clinton White House's chief administrator told a deputy and the personnel office director that they were all to help Lewinsky find a government job outside the White House

It was Tripp's recordings of Lewinsky describing her sexual relationship with Clinton that put the then-president on the defensive after he famously claimed 'I did not have sexual relations with that woman.'

Among documents released Friday by the Clinton Presidential Library is an email from Patsy Thomasson, then director of the White House Office of Administration, to two deputies, explaining that they were to help Lewinsky find a job in the Department of Defense.

'Our direction is to make sure she has a job in an Agency,' Thomasson wrote to White House management and administration director Jodie Torkelson, copying personnel director Bob Nash. 

'We have not finalized the deal but are working toward that end.'

'We are working closely with DOD to make this happen for Monica,' she wrote, adding that she was acting on a request from an aide named Tim.

'Monica is coming in to see me today pursuant to Tim's request,' she wrote. 

The note also referred to a second person in need of a job change, Director of Congressional Correspondence Jocelyn Jolley.

It was sent on April 9, 1996, at a time when Lewinsky was seen by West Wing insiders as a liability to Clinton. Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr would later present testimony to a grand jury from witnesses who said she spent a suspicious amount of time in or near the Oval Office in early 1996.

The Lewinsky story, first uncovered and subsequently spiked by Newsweek, reached the public through a little-known website called The Drudge Report, which quickly became a go-to online page for news junkies.

The Republican-led House of Representatives successfully impeached Clinton in December 1998 on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice.

One for the history books: President Clinton (right) had an 'inappropriate relationship' with Lewinsky (left), when she was 22 and 23

On the rocks: Clinton's marriage to future Secretary of State (and maybe presidential candidate) Hillary Rodham Clinton took a hit from what would be merely the most public in a series of political 'bimbo eruptions'

A Senate trial, however, failed to convict him and remove him from office – an outcome that required a two-thirds supermajority of senators. 

Democrats declared victory the day the votes were counted, and Clinton served out the remainder of his second term in office.

The Clinton Library released its seventh collection of papers from the 1993-2001 White House years on Friday, sending journalists into a frenzied read through thousands of pages of never-before-seen documents covering everything from the Whitewater scandal to the death of Vince Foster. 

Lewinsky has said publicly that she had trouble finding employment after she left the Pentagon in disgrace in 1997. She now writes blog essays for Vanity Fair

Tripp now lives in Middleburg, Virginia, where she runs a year-round Christmas shop with her husband.
