She just ended her engagement to Nick Loeb in May. And already Sofia Vergara looks to be off the market again.

While poolside in Hawaii on Wednesday, the 42-year-old actress flashed a large diamond rock on her wedding finger that looked like an engagement ring.

The Modern Family star was also seen kissing her beau of six months, Joe Manganiello, who she swept off to the tropical island not just to celebrate Christmas, but also to help him ring in his 38th birthday on Sunday.

Is that an engagement ring? The 42-year-old actress showed off a diamond rock on her wedding finger while kissing her beau of six months on the lips

A better look: The bling certainly looked like an engagement ring

Though the  actress sometimes wears a diamond ring to promote her jewelry line - So Sofia for Kay Jewelers - this one looked different.

The center rock was large and a rectangular shape and was surrounded by smaller diamonds.

It did not look like a cocktail ring or friendship ring. 

And the couple certainly looked plenty loved up, suggesting that a holiday proposal could have happened.

E! reported on Monday afternoon that the two are engaged, according to one of their sources, and specified that the proposal happened on Christmas Day.

Page Six also claims one of their sources is confirming the news.

Vergara's rep has yet to confirm.

When asked by Us Weekly what he thought about the engagement news, Vergara's ex Loeb said: 'She is beautiful and majestic and therefore to be loved.'

When Hollywood Life asked him about the engagement, he told the site, 'I hope they use Pickle Crunch on the wedding cake.' Loeb is the owner of Pickle Crunch as well as Onion Crunch, which are condiments.

Vergara and Manganiello were seen sitting side by side on lounge chairs as they sunned themselves in Hawaii. Sofia showed off her famous curves in not only a black two piece, but also a white ruffled once piece, and a Theodora & Callum scarf.

While working on her tan, the Colombian read books and magazines.
