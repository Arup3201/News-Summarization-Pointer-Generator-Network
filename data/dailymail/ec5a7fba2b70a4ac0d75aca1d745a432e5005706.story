When it comes to booking a surfing holiday, it's a destination most wouldn't have considered an option.

But holidaymakers who enjoy the sport can now book to ride the waves in North Korea.

The secretive country's 1,550-mile east coast is offering surfing tours, with three resorts opening to tourists.

Surf's up: The Korea International Travel Company is offering surfing tours to foreign tourists

The Korea International Travel Company (KITC) will be selling tours to tourists in the resorts of Songdowon, Lake Sijung and Majon for the five-day, four-night breaks - with the first excursion at the end of July deemed a success, according to the Pyongyang Times. 

During their stay, visitors are welcome to explore tourist attractions and places of historic interest in Pyongyang and other local areas.

However, the real attraction is the East Sea of Korea, which, according to the paper, offers  high and low waves, catering to athletes of all abilities.

'American surfers said they had a very good time in the bathing resort of the DPRK with fascinating scenery and a refreshing environment,' it added.

NK News has also confirmed that independent tour companies are now operating newly-organised excursions in the country.

At this point, however, the tours haven't been confirmed to be available to tourists domestically and it seems likely that visitors are required to bring their own equipment.

'There have been two surfing groups so far,' Beijing-based Koryo Tours employee Simon Cockerell told NK News. 

'Basically no special permission is needed as the places they go are places that are already open to tourists.' 

The news of expanded surf tourism comes after North Korean efforts to gradually open the country to visitors

In recent months, North Korea has displayed an interest in developing the country's east coast into a tourism hub, and targeting the foreign surfing community could prove just the ticket.

Andrea Lee of US-based North Korea tour company Uri Tours told NK News: 'There is potential for a surfing market in the DPRK tourism space and we expect to offer such tours more regularly.'

'We understand that the eastern coast of the DPRK produces good, surfable waves during the months of April to September.'
