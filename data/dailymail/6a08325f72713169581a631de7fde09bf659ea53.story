A BBC journalist was filmed giving a Nazi salute and goose stepping while filming a documentary about anti-Semitic football fans in Poland and Ukraine.

Chris Rogers was caught marching with one finger under his nose, as crew reportedly looked on.

The BBC Panorama documentary Euro 2012: Stadiums of Hate, was filmed two years ago ahead of the tournament in Poland and Ukraine - but details of the gaffe have only just come to light.

Mr Rogers - a former Newsround children's television presenter - admitted that he displayed a 'lack of judgment'.

He said: 'I fully accept that some of my behaviour, which was intended as a joke, was deeply inappropriate particularly given the seriousness of what we were filming.

'I apologised and was strongly reprimanded by the BBC. I might have displayed a lack of judgement but none of this detracts from the serious football racism exposed in the programme.'

There was an internal probe into Mr Rogers' behaviour, and he was temporarily frozen out of the show by a 'livid editor'. A spokesman said that Mr Rogers was freelance and had not been used for the Panorama programme in two years after the incident.

They added: 'Chris Rogers has apologised for his behaviour.

'We took the appropriate action at the time  - two years ago - and now regard the matter as closed. 

'The programme revealed serious racial abuse and violence in the host countries ahead of Euro 2012. Allegations were made in the Polish press at the time which were looked into and found to be completely untrue and we fully stand by the programme.'

At the time the documentary aired, one of the interviewees claimed he had been 'exploited' by the programme makers - something which the BBC strongly refuted.

Jonathan Ornstein,  executive director of the Jewish Community Centre of Krakow, gave an interview for the Panorama programme, and said he had been 'exploited' during the 
hour-long talk with the corporation as it 'completely disregarded 
anything positive said and aired only comments critical of Poland'.

Today he told the MailOnline: 'I think it's shocking and I think that it again reinforces the need to take another look at the whole programme that was produced.

'I have been saying from the beginning that this is someone that was coming in with an agenda. 

'Looking at the issue of racism in Poland while at the same time making light of it in this way is the height of hypocrisy.'

Mr
 Ornstein, an American-born Jew who has lived in Poland for 13 years 
says the images used were also selective.

'I am furious at the way the BBC has exploited me as a source', he said at the time.

Footage from the documentary showing anti-Semitic chants and racist monkey noises aimed at Black football players prompted former England captain Sol Campbell to warn fans not to travel to Poland and Ukraine otherwise 'you could end up coming back in a coffin.'

The programme also showed south Asian fans in the Ukraine being attacked at one game and crowds giving Nazi salutes at another.

The MailOnline has contacted the BBC for comment.
