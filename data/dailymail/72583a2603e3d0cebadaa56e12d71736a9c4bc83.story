His announcement as a contestant on reality show The Jump seemed to be a surprising move for the husband of a royal.

But Mike Tindall has revealed he and his wife Zara Phillips, 33, the Queen’s granddaughter, are not controlled by Palace protocol.

And when the Channel 4 ski contest begins on Sunday, the former England rugby star, 36, will join celebrities including Heather Mills, 47, Lady Victoria Hervey, 38, and Chloe Madeley, 27, on the slopes.

Giving a candid interview Tindall said it is a ‘lie’ that he and his wife are told what to do by the Royal Family.

He also opened up about the unedifying 2011 Rugby World Cup incident, shortly after his marriage, when he was pictured kissing another woman.

A previous venture into the world of entertainment by the Royal Family led to widespread ridicule - Prince Edward was criticised after broadcasting a royal version of the boisterous 1980s television game show It’s a Knockout - but Tindall said he would not allow this to restrict him.

He said: ‘They’re separate from us; we run our own life.’ He added: ‘That [how his involvement will reflect on the royals] would always come up, yes, of course, but ultimately it’s what we want to do first.’

It means Tindall, who was banned from skiing throughout his professional rugby career, in case of injury, has been free to accept a place on The Jump – marking his first move into the world of showbusiness.

And he has taken the opportunity to speak about the 2011 incident when he was drinking in a New Zealand bar with his England Rugby teammates. CCTV footage caught Tindall kissing a blonde woman, who was later revealed as his ex-girlfriend Jessica Palmer.

Asked whether he had any regrets over his behaviour, Tindall told Radio Times: ‘No, not really. It’s easy to look back and say you wish it hadn’t happened. If you’d asked me do I regret going out and having a good time with the fans and all the boys – no. But obviously if I had known the spin-off from it all, I wouldn’t want that.’

Miss Phillips, 33, who is the mother of Tindall’s one-year-old daughter Mia, was visibly upset during appearances following the scandal, but Tindall said: ‘Quite a big mountain was made out of a fairly small molehill.’

Taking part in The Jump will see Tindall and the 15 other contestants take part in a series of challenges on the slopes, including speed skiing, ski jumping and skeleton races.

Many of the disciplines can be dangerous. And two contestants have already pulled out with injuries - Sally Bercow, wife of the Speaker of the House of Commons, and Strictly Come Dancing professional Ola Jordan.

But Tindall said he sought advice from Sir Steve Redgrave, who suffered an injury during series one of the ski contest last year.

And the rowing champion’s enthusiasm for the contest made Tindall confident he has made the right choice.

Tindall said: ‘I asked him whether it was a good thing to do. Did he enjoy it? And he said “Yeah, I really enjoyed it. Do it. I’ve got nothing bad to say about it.” If a five-time Olympic gold-medallist tells you that, you’re in a pretty safe place.’

Speaking of his motivation, to take part, Tindall said: ‘I watched it last year and loved it, and pretty much said then that it would be one of the only TV shows I’d do. And the other reason is, I love skiing. I haven’t been able to ski for so long, with rugby getting in the way.

‘Since I stopped playing internationally, I’ve been three times in the last two years and loved it. So I loved the idea of being able to go out and get better at skiing. Getting that sort of high-end tutorage while we’re out there will be amazing. Plus there’s an element of competition, which I don’t get that often anymore.’

The Jump begins on Sunday January 1 at 7pm and is presented by Davina McCall. The other celebrities taking part include Gogglebox star Dom Parker, former England cricketer Phil Tufnell, Heptathlete Louise Hazel, and dancer Louie Spence. 

The Only Way Is Essex star Joey Essex, ex-Pussycat Doll Ashley Roberts and singer Stacey Solomon have also signed up, as well as Jack Ass star Steve-O, JLS singer JB Gill, Paralympian Jon-Allan Butterworth, model and TV presenter Jodie Kidd and Made In Chelsea star Louise Thompson.
