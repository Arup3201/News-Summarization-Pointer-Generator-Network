It's been quite a summer of upheaval in the Ospina family.

Daniela will be swapping life in decadent Monte Carlo for the bustle of metropolitan Madrid after her husband James Rodriguez was anointed Real's latest 'Galactico' in a £70m deal.

And now her goalkeeper brother David is departing the Cote d'Azur too, swapping Nice for Arsenal in a deal worth £3.2m confirmed over the weekend.

Following the arrivals of Alexis 
Sanchez and Mathieu Debuchy, Ospina was the third player through the door
 at the Emirates this close season. He has quickly been followed by Southampton's Calum Chambers.

His
 impressive performances in Colombia's run to the quarter-finals of the 
World Cup out in Brazil persuaded Arsene Wenger to move swiftly and sign
 him on a four-year contract as competition to Wojciech Szczesny.

He
 could possibly make his first appearance for the Gunners in this 
weekend's Emirates Cup, with Benfica and Monaco providing the 
opposition.

Wenger has made it clear that Ospina has every chance of usurping Szczesny as Arsenal's No 1 and will judge both on their form.

'You
 know at the start Szczesny will be the No 1, then again it will be down
 to performances and, if Ospina shows that he is better, he will play,' 
the Arsenal manager said.

Wenger
 was out in Brazil and soon identified 25-year-old Ospina as a 
ready-made replacement for the departing Lukas Fabianski, who has moved 
to Swansea.

Ospina has plenty of years ahead of him and is well-regarded for his shot-stopping and command of the penalty area.

He
 stands at 6ft tall - five inches shorter than Szczesny - but has 
strength and isn't cowed by the rough and tumble of the six-yard box at 
set-pieces.

Ospina starts at
 Arsenal with the absolute backing of his former coach at Nice, Claude 
Puel, who said the move would be 'fantastic' for his development.

'I think he can take the No 1 spot at Arsenal because his qualities are very, very strong,' Puel said.

'He is very good with his feet, with his arms, and he knows soccer. He is a very, very good player.'

Safe hands: Ospina catches the ball during the last eight match with Brazil at the World Cup, which Colombia lost 2-1
