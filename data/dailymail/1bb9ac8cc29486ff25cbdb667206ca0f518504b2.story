Republicans are now tied with Democrats among women voters, a new poll shows, introducing a surprising twist into the midterm elections.

Women have long been an essential component of the Democratic Party's base, and the party's declaration that the GOP is at war with women has gone a long way to set back the opposing political party with female voters.

An Associated Press-GfK poll released on Tuesday has 44 percent of women choosing the Republican Party to lead Congress while 42 percent stuck by the Democratic Party.

Women now say they'd like to see Republicans win control of Congress in the midterm elections. This represents a significant shift in voting patterns of women, who traditionally favor the Democratic Party. Just last month Democrats led Republicans among women by seven points

That's a significant shift from just a month ago when Democrats led Republicans 47-40 among women voters.

Republican National Committee Press Secretary Kirsten Kukowski told MailOnline in an email that the GOP's efforts to appeal to female voters with policies that cut across gender are proving successful.

'Women are sick and tired of being talked down to and treated like single issue voters by the Democrat Party,' Kukowski said. 

'Unlike what Cosmo and the Democrats might think, we care about more than reproductive rights, we want a strong economy, strong national defense and for everyone to have a shot at their American dream. Enough is enough and this poll reflects that.'

Republicans have struggled to gain ground with women ever since former Missouri Rep. Todd Akin suggested in 2012 that rape rarely leads to pregnancy.

'If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down,' Akin, the GOP's nominee for the Senate in Missouri, claimed.

The 'legitimate rape' incident, as it's now called, became a plague upon the Republican Party that year. A question about Akin's remarks took down the GOP's nominee to the Senate in Nebraska, state Treasurer Richard Mourdock, as well.

Democrats also used the GOP's opposition to the president's health care law against candidates, claiming it was evidence that Republicans don't care about women's health.

The health care law mandates that insurance companies cover contraception and preventative health services for women. It also bars insurance providers from declining Americans for coverage based on pre-existing conditions like pregnancy.

Republicans want to repeal the entire health care law and start from scratch. While they're not necessarily against requiring insurance companies to cover health screenings for women they believe that contraception coverage is a violation of businesses' religious liberties.

The GOP's position on the issue was construed in 2012 to mean that they were against access to contraception for women, and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney lost women to Barack Obama by 11 points as a result.

Since then, Democrats have made Republicans' refusal to pass legislation mandating that businesses pay their female employees the same amount as their male counterparts the centerpiece of their argument against the GOP when courting women voters.

In response to the AP poll, the Democratic National Committee told MailOnline on Wednesday that 'in governors races and senate races across the country we are seeing leads for Democrats with women voters and that's because our candidates have had their back.'

'From equal pay to access to health care, there's no question Democrats have supported the interests of women and families while Republicans have worked to obstruct progress,' DNC Deputy Communications Director Lily Adams said.

The DNC pointed to the Iowa Senate race as an example of how individual Democratic candidates are outpacing their Republican challengers with women.

There, Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley is winning women by 14 points despite the fact that the GOP contender, state senator Joni Ernst, is a woman, a poll issued by theDes Moines Register earlier this month shows.

The survey notably shows Braley losing male voters by 16 points, however, and losing the race to Ernst by a single digit. 

A Quinnipiac University poll taken a week later showed the same trend, with Ernst up by two overall and 18 points among men. Braley led among women in the poll 52-39.

The Associated Press discovered in its generic ballot test, which looks at parties, not candidates, this month that Americans nationwide prefer Democrats to lead Congress over Republicans by two points.

When the pool of respondents is winnowed down to just those who are considered likely to vote in the Nov. 4 elections, the pendulum shifts the other way, however. In that version of the poll, Republicans had a double-digit to lead over Democrats to win control of Congress.

Likely voters told AP's pollsters that they favor Republicans, 47 percent, to Democrats, 39 percent, to run the legislative branch.
