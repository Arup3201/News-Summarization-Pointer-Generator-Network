The body of the missing pregnant mother who was later revealed to be a Craigslist prostitute has been found on a dirt bike track and her husband and mother-in-law's cars have been seized

Jaymie Adams, 25, from Blanchard, Oklahoma, was reported missing on December 10 and was said to be pregnant with her fifth child.

When her body was found on Saturday by a motorcyclist using a dirt bike track near Lake Stanley Draper, police believed it had only been there for one day.

Investigation: The body of Jaymie Adams was found on Saturday on a dirt bike track and police believe it may have been there for a day

Yesterday they impounded the cars of her husband Justin, who only revealed two weeks after she went missing that she went to meet two clients after initially saying she was meeting a friend.

Oklahoma City police Captain Lisa 
Camacho told NewsOk that police have finished processing the site where the mother-of-four's body was found.

She said police then impounded the cars of Adams'
husband, Justin Adams, and his mother, Tina Clark, and are simply looking for evidence in the vehicles.

Though she said they have not named any suspects at this time, Adams' attorney told NewsOK they told his client at the time of his arrest that he was a suspect.

She said: 'At the time, my client was told he 
and his mother were suspects. When he attempted to get items out of the car they said no.

'He told that this is what they said to him that you're a suspect and you can't touch the car or get anything out of the car.'

He said he had plans to meet 
with Justin Adams and Tina Clark on Sunday evening and was not surprised they were suspects.

He told News Channel4: 'By innuendos, when they questioned him the time they were grilling him it was like he was a suspect.

'And you know he would have to be not very intelligent if he didn't believe that they were trying to make him a suspect the first time they interrogated him.'

Suspicious disappearance: The mother-of-four was said to have advertised as a 'massage therapist' on Craigslist but was actually a hooker

Husband: Justin Adams, 25, changed his story and told police he and his wife had advertised on Craigslist as 'swingers'

When police initially interviewed Adams in the days after his wife disappeared, he failed to mention 
that he and his wife were 'swingers' or that she advertised on 
Craigslist as a 'massage therapist' but had actually been 'meeting with 
strangers' for sex.

He then revealed that his wife went to meet a 'client' at a motel in Norman the night she disappeared.

Investigators discovered Mrs Adams' 
social security card and the couple's marriage license in a bedroom 
drawer at their home. A red purse containing several sex toys was also 
recovered.

Adams was the last
person to see his wife alive after she left their trailer park home to meet a 'friend' at a 
McDonald's.

He told police at the time she had called from 
the fast-food joint saying her 'friend' had not shown up - but that was 
the last he heard from her. He denied 
knowing who she was meeting.

The 25-year-old's car was found in the McDonald's parking lot and was seized for investigation.

Justin and Jaymie Adams have been married since February and have a four-month-old child together.

Last seen: She told her husband she was going to meet a 'friend' at this McDonalds at 11pm and police found her van here

Online: Police haven't officially named any suspects in the case or said if she was murdered

In the days after she went missing, Mr Adams made an emotional TV appeal, urging the public to help bring his wife home safely.

He said: 'She deserves to be at home with her family, our children need their mother.

'My wife is a loving a strong woman. She's an amazing mom, and amazing wife, we have three sons and she's 2-month pregnant this week.

'I'm begging that if anyone has any information about my wife or her whereabouts, call OKCPD.'
