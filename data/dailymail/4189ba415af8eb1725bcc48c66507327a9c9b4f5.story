A pair of newlyweds have made history by becoming the couple first to marry in a Church of Scientology chapel, hailing their wedding as a 'victory' over 'inequality and unfairness'.

Louisa Hodkin and Alessandro Calcioli, both 25, walked down the aisle in the historic ceremony after winning a landmark legal battle at the Supreme Court to exchange vows at the church.

Dressed in a traditional white wedding dress and clutching a white and red bouquet of flowers, Louisa beamed as she emerged from the ceremony arm in arm with her new husband.

Happy day: Dressed in a traditional white wedding dress and clutching a white and red bouquet of flowers, Louisa beamed as she emerged from the ceremony arm in arm with her new husband

Guests applauded and threw confetti over the newly married couple from East Grinstead, West Sussex, as they walked out of the Church of Scientology in Blackfriars, London following the service, which was broadcast live on the internet.

The new Mr and Mrs Calcioli were allowed to marry in the chapel after the Supreme Court ruled that it  was a 'place of meeting for religious worship'.

As the ceremony began, a female singer performed Some Say Love, by the American country and pop singer LeAnn Rimes.

Guests intoned Scientology's 'prayer for total freedom', saying the words: 'May the author of the universe enable all men to reach an understanding of their spiritual nature.

'May awareness and understanding of life expand, so that all may come to know the author of the universe.

'And may others also reach this understanding, which brings total freedom.

'At this time we think of those whose liberty is been threatened, of those who have suffered imprisonments for their belief, of those who are enslaved or martyred and of all those who are brutalised, trapped or attacked.

'We prey that human rights will be preserved, so that all people may believe and worship freely, so that freedom will once again be seen in our land.

'Freedom from war, and poverty, and want. Freedom to be, freedom to do and freedom to have. Freedom to use and understand man's potential - a potential that is god-given and god-like.

'And freedom to achieve that understanding and awareness, which is total freedom. May god let it be so.'

The groom's sister, who was among eight bridesmaids dressed in maroon, read an excerpt from 1922 children's novel The Velveteen Rabbit by Margery Williams.

Momentous: The couple hailed their wedding as a 'victory' over 'inequality and unfairness'

The bride's brother read from Scientology founder and pulp fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard's essay What Is Greatness?

'The hardest task one can have is to continue to love his fellows despite all reasons he should not,' he said.

'And the true sign of sanity and greatness is to so continue. For the one who can achieve this, there is abundant hope.

'For those who cannot, there is only sorrow, hatred and despair. And these are not the things of which greatness or sanity or happiness are made.'

There were laughs as guests were invited to speak up if there were any reason why the couple could not be legally joined in marriage - but remained silent. 

Beliefs: In a statement released ahead of today's nuptials, the couple said their wedding was a 'momentous' day and the culmination of a five-year battle to have their religious rights recognised

Both bridge and groom were asked if their 'reality of the love' they felt for each other was 'such as will be constantly creating through health and sickness, through adversity as well as good fortune, can you confront and grant forgiveness for shortcomings as readily as grant praise for their many sterling qualities?'

Both in turn answered 'yes' before also swearing their covenant to avow their 'solemn purpose to love, cherish and honour' each other.

Asked how he felt after the wedding, Mr Calcioli told Sky News: 'Just ecstatic - a little bit speechless, just so happy that this day has finally come.'

Ruling: The new Mr and Mrs Calcioli were allowed to marry in the chapel after the Supreme Court ruled that it  was a 'place of meeting for religious worship'

'We are extremely happy to announce today our marriage at the Church of Scientology in Queen Victoria Street, Victoria,' they said.

'It has been a long, five-year battle to achieve a simple freedom - the right to marry in our own church with a service in accordance with the rites and customs of our religion and surrounded by our friends and family.

'We are pleased and proud that our victory brings to an end inequality and unfairness, not just for Scientologists, but for people of all faiths - because the Supreme Court have now provided a definitive description of what a religion is, which had not existed before in English law.

'All weddings should be magical and momentous for the couple concerned, but we are conscious that ours, as the first for our religion in England, has its own place in history.'

The couple said they decided to share 'this happy day' with the world on their website, adding: 'We would like to thank everyone who has sent us their good wishes.

'We are naturally extremely excited.'

Miss Hodkin took legal action after the registrar general of births, deaths and marriages refused to register the London Church Chapel for the solemnisation of marriages under the 1855 Places of Worship Registration Act - because it was not a place for 'religious worship'.

Five Supreme Court justices upheld Miss Hodkin's challenge in December following a hearing in London last July.

In their ruling they said religion should not be confined to faiths involving a 'supreme deity'.

They said the Church of Scientology held religious services, therefore its church was a 'place of meeting for religious worship'.

A Church of Scientology spokesman said: 'We are delighted that Louisa and Alessandro can now be married in their church in front of their family and fellow parishioners.

'They have paved the way for other Scientologist couples.

Refusal: The registrar general of births, deaths and marriages had refused to register the London Church Chapel for the solemnisation of marriages under the 1855 Places of Worship Registration Act - because it was not a place for 'religious worship'

'We extend our congratulations to the happy couple and wish them well in their future life together.

'This is an historic day for religious equality and freedom for all in the UK.'

Since 2005 a new law enabled couples in Britain to marry in premises approved by local authorities, such as hotels and stately homes - rather than just a church or registry office.

Civil marriage venues have since been expanded to include pubs, football grounds, wine distilleries, and other places far removed from a traditional church setting.

The case was of particular importance to the Church of Scientology and its followers as several similar cases have been turned down in court in the past.

Scientology is a religious belief system that teaches that people are immortal beings who have forgotten their true nature.

Famous Scientologists include actors Tom Cruise and John Travolta.

Founder: American science fiction author L. Ron Hubbard in 1969

The Church of Scientology was founded in 1953 by American science fiction author L. Ron Hubbard.

Hubbard wrote that 75 million years ago, an alien ruler called Xenu brought billions of his people to Earth in a spaceship before killing them in a bomb blast, leaving their spirits to wander around and harm the living.

According to Hubbard, following Scientology means you can be clear of these malevolent spirits.

Scientology describes itself as the study and handling of the spirit in relationship to itself, others, and all of life. One purpose of Scientology, as stated by the Church, is to become certain of one's spiritual existence and one's relationship to God, or the 'Supreme Being.'

Scientologists believe that in addition to the five senses of hearing, sight, touch, taste and smell we have 57 additional abilities known as 'perceptics'.

These include an ability to sense blood circulation, balance, compass direction, temperature, gravity as well as an 'awareness of importance, unimportance.'

In order to ascend up the Scientology ladder, followers must complete a number of courses and be 'Clear' in Dianetics. This is a state, according to Hubbard, when a human 'no longer has his own reactive mind and therefore suffers none of the ill-effects that the reactive mind can cause.'

The Church believes that humans suffer unwanted and negative feelings, which lead to illnesses. If every person applies Dianetics in their life, they can be 'Clear', or free, of these feelings and therefore avoid sickness.

The next stage is to achieve Operating Thetan levels, or OTs for short. There are eight levels before the truth of Scientology can be fully revealed. It is believed that actor Tom Cruise took five years to reach this level.
