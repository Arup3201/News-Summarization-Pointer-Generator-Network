Working parents earning up to £150,000 each are to get childcare tax breaks worth as much as £1,200 a year per child.

Chancellor George Osborne will unveil a long-awaited £1bn scheme that will mean all but the best-off benefiting from tax relief, despite Nick Clegg’s insistence last month that the scheme would be ‘targeted’.

But the move will only apply to couples where both parents are working, or single parents who are employed – likely to spark a backlash from stay-at-home mothers and traditionalist Tory MPs who argue it discriminates against women.

Well off: Working parents earning up to £150,000 are to get childcare tax breaks worth as much as £1,200 a year per child

Officials from the Treasury suggested there was not enough money to support all families with child care.

The document says: 'We need to focus our resources. Working families who are struggling with their childcare costs or families where parents wants to go to work but can’t afford to, are in greater need of state support for childcare than families where one parent chooses to stay home and look after their children full time.'

David Cameron believes the cost of childcare has become the number one cost of living issue for working couples.

Childcare costs in Britain amount to 43 per cent of average incomes, compared with only 14.8 per cent in France, 9.1 per cent in Germany and 8.4 per cent in Denmark, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

As a result, the Government believes a million women who want to work are missing from the workforce, put off by high fees for nurseries or childminders.

The scheme, to be unveiled in the Budget tomorrow, will ultimately benefit around 2.5million working families. Around £1billion has been set aside to fund it, though details of where the money is coming from will be announced by Mr Osborne in his Commons statement.

Scheme: George Osborne will announce that all but the best-off benefit from tax relief

They will be offered a tax-free 
childcare scheme worth up to £1,200 per child. This will save a typical 
working family with two children under 12 up to £2,400 a year. The 
scheme will be phased in from 2015 and for the first year will be open 
to 1.3million families with children under the age of five.

The scheme will build up over time to include children under 12, as existing workplace childcare vouchers, currently subsidised by the taxpayer, are closed to new claimants from 2015 and phased out. To be eligible, families will have both parents or a single parent in work, with each earning less than £150,000 a year, and will not already receive support through tax credits or the new universal credit.

David Cameron said those who work hard must be helped

They will receive 20 per cent – equivalent to the basic rate of tax – of their yearly childcare costs, up to a total of £6,000 per child. For a family with two children, the new offer will be worth more than double the amount of a single claim for workplace childcare vouchers. It will be open to around five times as many families.

The Prime Minister said: ‘If Britain is going to succeed in the global race we must help those who work hard and want to get on.

‘Too many families find paying for childcare tough and are often stopped from working the hours they’d like. That is why we are introducing tax free-childcare, saving a typical family with two children up to £2,400 a year.

‘This is a boost direct to the pockets of hard-working families in what will be one of the biggest measures ever introduced to help parents with childcare costs.’ Deputy Prime Minister Mr Clegg said an extra £200million of support will be provided within universal credit to help poorer families.

Details of the scheme will be finalised after a consultation, but it is expected that parents will be able to open an online childcare voucher account and have their payments topped up by Government.

The scheme comes on top of government support already announced, including extending the free entitlement to provide 15 hours a week of free early education and childcare for all three and four-year-olds and extending 15 hours of free childcare a week to 40 per cent of two-year-olds from 2014-15.

Labour education spokesman Stephen Twigg said: ‘Parents will be disappointed that they will not get any help with childcare costs for another two and a half years.’

The Child Poverty Action Group said the new scheme was 'massively complicated, poorly targeted and too many years away to provide comfort for families struggling right now', as well as being 'weighted heavily in favour of those on high incomes'.

The charity Working Families raised concerns that - unlike the ESC vouchers - the new system will provide no help for couples where one partner is studying or retraining or has been made redundant and is looking for work.

'It is important that families in these situations don't lose out, and that support is available to those trying to get back into work,' said chief executive Sarah Jackson.

The disposable income of an average family is twice what it was in the late 1970s, official figures showed yesterday.

But the report reveals that the rise is not down to significant tax cuts, as the taxman’s share of middle-class incomes has hardly changed over the past 35 years.

The disposable income after taxes and benefits of a middle-earning and working age household is currently £29,900, according to the analysis from the Office for National Statistics.

This is a fall from a peak of £31,100 in 2007, before the recession eroded the earnings of middle Britain. But back in 1977, the era of union barons and near national bankruptcy, the average disposable income was half this level when calculated at today’s prices – £15,500.

The proportion the Treasury takes from the average income in tax has hardly changed.

Instead the state has continued to demand virtually the same share of middle incomes – around a third. This means that, in real cash terms, governments have taken increasing amounts from families.

The ONS report says that, at current prices, the taxman was grabbing a little over £8,000 a year from an average income family in 1977, but £14,464 out of their income in 2007, and £12,654 now.
