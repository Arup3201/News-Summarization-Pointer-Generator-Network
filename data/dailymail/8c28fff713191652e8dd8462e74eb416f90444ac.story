A survey released reveals that a third of men would now describe themselves as vain. One in three men also admitted that they indulge in a beauty treatment at least once a month

The battle for the bathroom in the morning has never been so fraught. 

The new generation of 30-something men have grown up with the likes of David Beckham and Brad Pitt as style icons, breeding thousands of copycats who no longer see spas as the domain of women. 

A survey released today reveals that a third of men would now describe themselves as vain. 

One in three men also admitted that they indulge in a beauty treatment at least once a month to maintain their looks, compared to just one in four women. 

The most popular treatments are some of the more traditional - 41 per cent of the procedures booked by men are hot shaves, while 33 per cent were taken up with relaxing massages. 

But achieving a higher level of beauty was definitely key for many - one in ten men admitted to having their underarms waxed and 12 per cent of men revealed they had received a back wax. 

The TOWIE and Geordie Shore television shows have also had an effect on men's grooming - 15 per cent of men admitted to booking themselves in for a sunbed session.

Meanwhile, the survey by lastminute.com showed 16 per cent of men had paid for a facial and 13 per cent had experienced a pedicure.

These pamper sessions have become such a way of life for some men that they even book themselves in before important meetings - fourteen per cent of men said they would get beauty treatments ahead of a job interview to give them a last minute polish.

One in ten also admitted to getting a beauty treatment like a tanning bed session before a date. 

Men from Birmingham were the most proud of their appearance, with the average male in the city spending £326 annually on beauty treatments, compared to the national average of £155, while Belfast boys were bottom of the list with a yearly spend of £95.

And it seems that male celebrities are mainly to blame for this rise in beauty culture - when asked who their ultimate pin-up is, super-styled David Beckham topped the poll as having the most desirable look, with George Clooney and Brad Pitt coming in at second and third place.

Andy Penniceard, owner and founder of Privet Body, a spa leader for male treatments, said:

'The research from lastminute.com only highlights what we have been witnessing in the salon - an increasing trend for men taking more care of their health and appearance. 

'There's definitely evidence to suggest that men are using beauty treatments as a way to spoil themselves. 

'The majority of men coming for hair removal might be under 35, but you'd be surprised how many older chaps come in to be tidied up downstairs. 

'Some of them just like the clean feel of a hairless body, some like the look, and a lot of them might be doing it because their partner prefers it!'
