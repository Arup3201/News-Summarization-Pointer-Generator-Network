Anthrax is very rare but it's a bacterial infection caused by Bacillus anthracis (pictured)

A drug user has died after being infected with anthrax, health experts said.

The Health Protection Agency said that a person who injected drugs died in hospital in Blackpool.

The name of the person or the hospital has not been disclosed.

The HPA said the source of the infection is presumed to be contaminated heroin.

The news comes after a spate of cases in Europe since early June.

The HPA said it is 'unclear' whether the case in Blackpool and another case in Scotland - which was confirmed at the end of July - are linked to the European outbreak.

Anthrax is a rare bacterial infection and is primarily a disease of herbivorous mammals, though other animals and some birds can also contract it.

Bacillus anthracis spores can survive in the environment for years or decades.

Dependent on the dose and route of exposure, the symptoms may develop within a week of taking heroin.

An HPA spokesperson said: 'The patient 
comes from the north west of England and was taken to hospital earlier 
this week and died shortly afterwards.

'The infection was cultured in the laboratory and the results came back last night that it was anthrax.

'It is very difficult to identify the 
source of the anthrax because the spores are miniscule. We do not know 
where it may have originated.

'We are telling people on the ground who
work with drugs users to be aware of the danger and look out for gashes
that develop around injection sites.

Addict: Heroin users have been warned to look out for signs of infection which include redness or
excessive swelling or high temperatures, chills or headache

'You can treat anthrax with antibiotics 
if caught early, otherwise it can be fatal. That is the vital message we
are trying to get out.'

Since June there have been seven 
confirmed cases of the infection - one in Scotland, three in Germany, 
two in Denmark, and one in France.

These are the first cases of anthrax among drug users in Europe since the outbreak during 2009 and 2010.

That outbreak saw 119 cases in Scotland, five cases in England and two cases in Germany.

Among
them was heroin user Shane Brown, 24, from Blackpool, who died after 
testing positive for anthrax at the town's Victoria Hospital in 2010.Â 

Signs of infection include redness or
excessive swelling at the injection site, or a high temperature, 
chills or a severe headache or breathing difficulties.

Infection: The Health Protection Agency said that a person who injected drugs died in hospital in Blackpool - although the hospital has not been named

Dr Dilys Morgan, an expert in 
zoonotic infections at the HPA, said: 'It's likely that further cases 
among PWID (people who inject drugs) will be identified as part of the 
ongoing outbreak in EU countries.

'The
Department of Health has alerted the NHS of the possibility of PWID 
presenting to emergency departments and walk-in clinics, with symptoms 
suggestive of anthrax.

'Anthrax
can be cured with antibiotics, if treatment is started early. It is 
therefore important for medical professionals to know the signs and 
symptoms to look for, so that there are no delays in providing the 
necessary treatment.'

European health experts say that the recent 
cases could have come from the same batch of contaminated heroin in the 
2009 to 2010 outbreak.

Dr Morgan added: 'As part of the 
response to the 2009/10 outbreak, the HPA developed an algorithm for the
clinical evaluation and management of PWID with possible anthrax.

'This algorithm specifies the kinds of presentations where anthrax should be considered, and outlines the actions to take.'

Anthrax in drug users was considered to be very rare.

Prior to the 2009-2010 outbreak in Scotland, just one previous case had been reported in Norway in 2000.

The risk to the general population is negligible. It is extremely rare for anthrax to be spread from person to person.
