After travelling to Japan earlier this week to film a mattress advert, the 22-year-old jetted off to the party capital of the world where he met the American socialite.

He and Hilton, who is the daughter of Hilton Hotels founder Conrad Hilton, appear to enjoying a night out together in the picture posted to his 10 million Instagram followers.

It is not the first time Hilton has been seen partying with footballers.

In 2009, the 33-year-old celebrated with Cristiano Ronaldo in Las Vegas as he sealed an £80million transfer to Real Madrid from Manchester United.

Neymar also shared an image of himself with Bayern Munich's Bastian Schweinsteiger, who is enjoying an extended break after helping Germany lift the World Cup in Brazil.

The former Santos star wished the midfielder a happy birthday as he turned 30.
