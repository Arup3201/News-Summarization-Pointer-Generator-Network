Former Arsenal full back Bacary Sagna has revealed he left the club in search of trophies, not money.

The 31-year-old spent seven years with the Gunners, but only won one trophy - the 2014 FA Cup - during his time there. 

Much to the dismay of Arsenal fans, the France international then made the well-worn route from the Emirates Stadium to the Etihad on a free transfer.

Supporters accused Sagna of being a mercenary after he failed to sign a new deal with Arsene Wenger's side, but the former Auxerre man said he had been attracted to the Premier League champions for other reasons.

'At Arsenal we lost our way every season in March or April,' Sagna told The Sun.

'We would lose our grip on titles with the squad decimated by injuries. What was missing was trophies.

'Talks dragged on for a year and a half. Arsenal fans said I went to City for the money. But my contract was unchanged for six years.' 

Sagna's path to Manchester City is one well travelled by Arsenal players in recent years
