Defence Secretary: Michael Fallon said Britain wanted Turkey to become 'more involved' in the fight

Turkey last night warned it was ‘unrealistic’ to expect it to launch a ground offensive against Islamic State without support from other Nato members.

Britain and the United States have been pressing Turkey for weeks to play a major military role against the extremists who have now advanced to within less than a mile of its border with Syria.

Defence Secretary Michael Fallon yesterday said Britain wanted Turkey to become ‘more involved’ in the fight against Isis.

But Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu has ruled out a unilateral offensive.

Speaking after talks in Ankara with Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg he warned that the US-led bombing missions against Isis forces in Syria would not be enough, but said that Turkey would not get involved at this stage.

‘You need to take into consideration all options, including an operation on the ground,’ he said. ‘You cannot expect Turkey to do a land operation. This is not a realistic approach.’

Turkey has the second largest army in Nato but has chosen to stand by and watch the ferocious battle for the Syrian border town of Kobani, which is besieged by Isis fanatics.

There has been growing frustration among members of the US-led coalition being assembled against Isis at the reluctance of Turkey to intervene, despite having forces positioned on the border.

One British defence source last night said Turkey appeared to be waiting for an attack by Isis in order to invoke Nato’s principle of collective self-defence, which could drag the entire military alliance into the war.

Mr Fallon yesterday confirmed that Britain and the US would be stepping up pressure on Turkey to take the initiative against Isis.

‘Turkey certainly could help,’ he said. ‘It’s a matter for Turkey, but other allies in the region have been helping.

‘From the south, some of the Gulf countries and Saudi Arabia were helping in American strikes and in the end, yes, this is a situation that can only be resolved not just by America and by Britain but by the region itself.

‘So we’d certainly like to see Turkey more involved, but in the end that’s obviously a decision for their government.

He went on: ‘They’re certainly very aware of the situation in Kobani, the desperate situation there, and obviously we’ll have to see whether they can help more...

‘Every country comes to this from its own position. They’ve obviously had difficulties with Kurdish extremism in the past; they’ve had hostages very recently and so on.

‘But clearly every country in the region has got to see now what it can do to contribute to deal with Isil [ISIS]. Otherwise we will have Iraq falling apart and Syria falling apart and that is a danger to the entire region.’

Mr Fallon also confirmed that Britain is working with the United States to set up military training camps for ‘moderate’ Syrian fighters elsewhere in the Middle east.

He said: ‘We are looking, with the United States, at training of the moderate Syrians that we can identify, but outside Syria. 

'Providing training in camps elsewhere in the Middle East, where we can train those in community self-defence in being able to resist Isil [Isis], but doing that outside Syria and then putting them back into the fight in Syria, and we’re trying to identify that effort at the moment.

‘There’s the Free Syrian Army, there are moderate elements in that, and there are other places in the Middle East where they could be trained, in Jordan for example, in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere. That’s something we’re looking at very urgently now.’

Mr Fallon acknowledeged that Isis has to be defeated in both Iraq and Syria, but said ministers do not believe that Parliament is ready to authorise the extension of military action into Syria.

‘We don’t have authority from Parliament to operate in Syria at the moment. Our judgment at the moment is that Parliament wouldn’t give us that authority,’ he said.

Madeleine Moon, a labour member of the Commons defence committee, said there was no case for further British intervention until Turkey stepped up to take its share of responsibility.

She said: ‘Let’s talk about Turkey’s role – they won’t even let us fly our jets to help, so they have to fly from Cyprus. There is no good that can come from Britain taking unilateral action.’
