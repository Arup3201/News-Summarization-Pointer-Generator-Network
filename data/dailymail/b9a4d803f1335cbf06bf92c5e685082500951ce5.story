A Chinese fish market was thrown into turmoil yesterday after a monger found a live and unexploded bomb inside the belly of a squid.

The drama unfolded in a seafood bazaar in Guangdong province to the south of China as the unsuspecting fishmonger gutted the three-foot cephalopod for a customer.

When he sank his knife into the tentacled sea-creature's soft flesh its blade struck something hard and metallic.

He opened it up to find the eight-inch explosive that experts later revealed could have gone off at any moment.

He called police instantly who arrived at the scene and took the ordinance away to perform a controlled explosion.

It is yet unclear how the bomb found its
 way inside the squid, although police said it may have been dropped by a
 fighter plane and washed into the squid's feeding ground. They would 
not reveal how old it was or whether it was of Chinese origin.

'This sort of squid lives close to the shore and normally makes a meal of small fish and prawns,' said the fishmonger, who gave his name only as Mr Huang to the local Guangzhou Daily newspaper.

'Perhaps he thought the bomb was his 
favourite food and gulped it down. He certainly had a big belly when he 
was caught,' he added.

It was netted in shallows off the coast of Jiaoling county where squid like to hunt, mine-sweeping the sandy bed for bite-size sealife.

The Guangzhou newspaper reminded readers who find unexploded ordinance inside fish to always call police.
