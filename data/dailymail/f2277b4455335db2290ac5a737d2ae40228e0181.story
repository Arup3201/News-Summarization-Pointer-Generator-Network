Brighton manager Sami Hyypia has made Aaron Hughes his first signing after joining the club this summer.

The 34-year-old was a free agent after leaving QPR at the end of last season.

Hughes, who can play at centre-back and full-back, has signed a one year deal with the Seagulls.

New recruit: Aaron Hughes has joined Brighton on a one-year deal in the Championship

First signing: He becomes the piece of business done by new boss Sami Hyypia

Brighton finished sixth in the Championship last campaign, but former boss Oscar Garcia resigned from his position after their failure to beat Derby County in the play-off semi-finals - paving the way for Hyypia to join.

The veteran will compete with the likes of Matthew Upson and Gordon Greer for a centre-back role.

Hughes has over 15 years of Premier League experience with the likes of Newcastle, Aston Villa and Fulham.
