Booed: Gay soldier Stephen Hill asks his question via video-link from Iraq

He appeared to have paused as boos echoed through the Orange County Convention Center during last night's GOP debate following a question from a gay U.S. soldier serving in Iraq.

But presidential hopeful Rick Santorum claims he heard not a sound of dissent from the crowd following the soldier's question on the repeal of the Army's 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' policy on homosexuality.

And if he had heard them, he would have paused to condemn the disrespectful jeers, he said.

Stephen Hill, who has recently come out as gay, was shown via a YouTube video link from Iraq, asking: 'Do you plan to circumvent the progress that has been made for gay and lesbian soldiers in the military?' 

But as he did several members of the audience responded with boos.

Gay rights groups have attacked the GOP 
and Santorum on the issue - after not one of the nine candidates rushed 
to Hill's defence.

Adding insult to their plight, Santorum responded by saying he believed the recent
 policy change was bad for the military, prompting the crowd erupted into thunderous applause.

But the politician insists his reaction would have been much different had he not been so focused on formulating his answer.

Santorum told Fox News: 'Yeah, well, I condemn the people who booed that gay soldier. That soldier is serving our country, I thank him for his service to our country. I’m sure he’s doing an excellent job. I hope he is safe, and I hope he returns safely, and does his mission well.

Controversial: Senator Rick Santorum was cheered when he said he would reinstitute the 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' policy on homosexuality in the military

'I have to admit, I seriously did not
 hear those boos. Had I heard them, I certainly would have commented on 
them. But as you know, when you’re in that sort of environment, you’re 
focused on the question and formulating your answer. And I just didn’t 
hear those couple of boos that were out there.

'But certainly, had I, I would have 
said that that was - I would have said, don’t do that, this man is 
serving our country, and we are to thank him for his service.'Reacting 
to last night's debate, 
GOProud - a conservative gay rights group - issued a statement 
condemning
 the reaction of the crowd, as well as the candidates.'

His defense comes less than 24 hours 
after his divisive stand on the issue on last night's stage in Orlando, 
Florida. Santorum said: 'I would say any type of sexual activity has 
absolutely no place in the military.

'The fact they are making a point to 
include it as a provision within the military that we are going to 
recognize a group of people and give them a special privilege to, and 
removing don't ask don’t tell I think tries to inject social policy into
 the military. And the military's job is to do one thing: to defend our 
country...'

And when the presenter asked what he 
would do about Mr Hill and gays already serving in the army Santorum 
continued: 'What we are doing is playing social experimentation with our
 military right now.

'That’s tragic. I would just say that going forward we would re-institute that policy if Rick Santorum was president.

Jeers: The crowd at the Republican Presidential debate booed a serving soldier as he asked candidates a question about gays in the army

'That policy would be re-instituted as
 far as people in, I would not throw them out because that would be 
unfair to them because of the policy of this administration. 

'But
 we would move forward in conformity with what was happening in the 
past. Which was- sex is not an issue. It should not be an issue. Leave 
it alone. Keep it to yourself whether you are heterosexual or 
homosexual.'

DADT was official army policy since 1993 until it was repealed on September 20, this year.

It
 was introduced to stop people who 'demonstrate a propensity or intent 
to engage in homosexual acts' from serving in the armed forces in the 
belief their presence 'would create an unacceptable risk to the high 
standards of morale, good order and discipline, and unit cohesion that 
are the essence of military capability.'

The
 booing incident has provoked fury amongst gay rights groups and many 
commentators claim Santorum had failed to show sufficient respect to a 
serving soldier.

GOProud leaders Christopher Barron 
and Jimmy LaSalvia said: 'Tonight, Rick Santorum disrespected our brave 
men and women in uniform, and he owes Stephen Hill, the gay soldier who 
asked him the question about Don't Ask, Don't Tell repeal, an immediate 
apology.'

Speaking to 
Salon.com anti-DADT campaigner and former U.S. soldier Dan Choi said: 
'Any soldier who courageously stands for truth and not comfort should be
 applauded, supported, and respected.

'Stephen Hill serves our country.

'Those who boo our honourable soldiers do not support our troops.'

The 
Presidential hopeful, who some have claimed was the winner of the 
debate, is known for his controversial comments on homosexuality.

In a 2003 interview he said that homosexual acts 'undermine the basic tenets of our society and the family.'

He added: 'If the Supreme Court says that you have the right to consensual sex within your home then you have the right to bigamy, you have the right to polygamy, you have the right to incest, you have the right to adultery.'

And when asked about how to prevent sexual abuse of children by priests, Santorum said the priests were engaged in 'a basic homosexual relationship', going on to say he had: '...no problem with homosexuality. I have a problem with homosexual acts.'

In response to his comments activists set up websites linking his name to a term involving gay sex.

Santorum has now appealed to Google to remove the comments saying: 'I suspect if something was up there like that about Joe Biden, they'd get rid of it.

'If you're a responsible business, you don't let things like that happen in your business that have an impact on the country.'

'To have a business allow that type of filth to be purveyed through their website or through their system is something that they say they can't handle but I suspect that's not true.'
