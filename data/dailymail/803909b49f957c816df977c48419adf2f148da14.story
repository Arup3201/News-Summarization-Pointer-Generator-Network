More than a million patients will face disruption because of the first doctors’ strike in nearly 40 years next week.

Members of the British Medical Association will refuse to treat patients for 24 hours unless their condition is life-threatening or urgent.

But Thursday’s day of action over changes to doctors’ pensions has already led to the cancellation of tens of thousands of cataract  operations, hip and knee replacements and many more routine tests and scans.

In addition, 1.25million GP appointments will also be postponed – including 400,000 involving the elderly and 140,000 for children. Last night there were fears that the strike would immediately create a huge backlog that will have knock-on effects for the NHS for several weeks.

Patients whose operations, hospital tests or scans were due to take place on Thursday have been sent cancellation letters but many have still to be given a new appointment date.

Last night the Department of Health warned this could take some time. Other victims of the dispute include 1,350 waiting for cataract surgery and 700 awaiting hip and knee replacements. Another 7,500 with heart problems have had appointments cancelled and a further 7,500 paediatric appointments will be postponed

Around 9,500 pregnant women have had tests and scans cancelled and 200,000 hospital outpatient appointments will need to be rescheduled.

Accident and Emergency wards will remain open, however, and doctors have pledged to treat anyone with an urgent complaint. But Roger Goss, of pressure group Patient Concern, said: ‘It is absolute nonsense for the BMA to claim that the interests of their patients are paramount.

‘Frankly the industrial action is an outrage. The doctors in this country are among the best paid, with the most generous pensions in the world.’

Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients’ Association, has warned that the strike is a ‘huge risk’ because of the difficulty of working out who needs treatment and who can wait.

Working overtime: Health Secretary Andrew Lansley has urged doctors to work at the weekend to clear the backlog caused by the strike

Dean Royles, director of the NHS Employers organisation, said he was ‘very worried’ about the protest. He added: ‘Doctors know any industrial action will impact on care and cause distress and disruption to patients and undermine trust in the medical profession.’

Health Secretary Andrew Lansley has told those GPs planning to strike to consider working the following Saturday to clear the backlog of appointments.

In a letter to the BMA’s head Hamish Meldrum, he says they must ensure patients are seen quickly as ‘today’s routine appointments could become tomorrow’s emergencies’.

But because GPs are self-employed – and Mr Lansley isn’t technically their boss – they are unlikely to agree to make up the lost time in this way.

Most GPs have not done a weekend shift since 2004 when a deal brought in by Labour enabled them to opt-out of out-of-hours work.

Responding to the letter, Dr Meldrum told Mr Lansley that the decision to take action ‘was not taken lightly’.

It remains unclear how many of the 150,000 doctors in England and Wales will take part in Thursday’s protest and many have admitted they are deeply opposed.

But the BMA is angry that reforms to their pensions will mean doctors have to contribute more and retire later. At present, a consultant earning £120,000 can expect to retire at 60 on an annual pension of £48,000, with a £140,000 lump sum.

The decision to stage industrial action followed a ballot involving 52,000 members, of whom the majority voted in favour. But another 52,000 members didn’t return their voting slips and at least 50,000 other doctors do not belong to the BMA.
