If you’re hooked on fashion, there’s nothing more frustrating than having to wait for the high street to pick up on your favourite celebrity’s outfit.

But Carey Mulligan is offering her fans an instant chance to get their hands on the stunning fish-scales Prada dress she wore to the Met Gala in New York.

The only snag is you’ll have to have deep pockets . . . and a tiny waist.

All angles: Carey Mulligan's beautiful Prada dress is up for auction on eBay for the charity Oxfam America

The sequinned gown – a UK size 6 to 8 made especially for the Drive star – is up for auction on eBay in aid of Oxfam America.

After being placed online, the 
halter-neck dress, covered in gold and silver paillettes, quickly 
received bids. With eight days still remaining it has already reached a 
price of more than £600.

The Oscar nominee, 26, attended then Schiaparelli and Prada: Impossible Conversations 
exhibition 
ball on Monday night with her new husband Marcus Mumford.

The pair 
married last month surrounded by close friends and family in Somerset.

Photographed dancing the night away in the dress with Mr Mumford, who she married last month, the actress sparkled in her bespoke Prada number.

While sitting down during the evening, 
Ms Mulligan said: 'I might start losing sequins but that's OK. 
They were very laissez-faire about it.'

Hot auction: Bidding ends on May 19 for the custom-made Prada dress

If you are in the market an 
outstanding, one-off dress worn by the Academy Award nominee and Great 
Gatsby star, bidding ends on May 19.

The dress, which topped many best-dressed lists, will then be shipped off to the highest bidder before June 11.

All money raised from the sale will go to 
Oxfam, an international relief and development organisation that aims to
create lasting solutions to poverty, hunger, and injustice.

This isn't the first time Ms Mulligan has donated a red-carpet dress to the charity however.

The actress gave her Vionnet gown she wore to the 2010 BAFTA Awards, where she won best actress for her role in An Education, to Oxfam also, which the charity then sold on her behalf.
