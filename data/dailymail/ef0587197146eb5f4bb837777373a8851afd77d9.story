Amanda Knox has gone from being the subject of intense media frenzy to a member of the Fourth Estate.

Nine months after an Italian court convicted Ms Knox in absentia for the second time of murdering her roommate, the 27-year-old was hired as a freelance writer at weekly West Seattle Herald.

Knox, who traveled to Perugia, Italy, back in 2007 to study creative writing, has now come a full circle.

Good intentions: Robinson said that the paper wanted to give Knox (pictured in January 2014), who grew up in West Seattle, a chance to 'be an actual human being'

According to her editor Patrick Robinson, Amanda has been quietly writing human interest stories and covering the local theater scene for several months now.

'We approached her originally to give her the opportunity of a normal life,' Robinson told The Daily Beast.

'We simply asked her as we would ask anyone of that age and stage, if they would be interested in writing for us as a qualified writer of that scale and this level of journalism.'

At first, the rookie reporter asked to write under a nom de plume to protect her privacy in light of her notoriety.

Robinson told the paper that after submitting her first few writing samples and getting her bearings, Knox started churning out articles under her real byline.

So far, Italy’s infamous convicted murderer has written about 10 stories, including a review of a high school production of Tom Stoppard’s play Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead.

'Amanda’s a very bright, very capable, highly qualified writer,' Robinson said. 'She’s certainly been through as lot and been very easy to work with and very interested and eager in doing stories.' 

Robinson said that the paper wanted to give Knox, who grew up in West Seattle, a chance to 'be an actual human being versus a celebrity.'

The editor noted that the newspaper is not concerned with the Italian justice system's ongoing campaign to have Knox extradited.

Amanda Knox's murder case has been making headlines around the world for the past seven years.

In November 2007, Meredith Kercher, Amanda's college roommate in Perugia, was discovered with her throat slit.

Knox and her then-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, were charged with killing the British national and convicted of the crime in 2009, despite widespread accusations that the case was badly mishandled by the prosecution.

Two years later, the lovers were cleared of the charges on appeal, allowing Knox to return home to Seattle after spending four years in an Italian jail.

In January 2014, Amanda's acquittal was overturned, and an Italian court once again found her guilty and re-sentenced her to 28 years in prison.

So far, Knox has not been extradited by the US Department of Justice. Italy's highest court is expected to review the case next year.

Since her dramatic return to the US, Knox has been keeping busy: she re-enrolled in University of Washington to complete her degree in creative writing and penned a memoir, which came out last year.

Her legal saga has inspired two movies, including a Lifetime film starring Hayden Panettiere and director Michael Winterbottom’s new feature, The Face of an Angel, with supermodel Cara Delevigne.

Amanda Knox's latest article appeared in the West Seattle Herald on October 29.

The rookie reporter wrote about a Kickstarter campaign to fund a local couple's organic cashew milk business.

Patrick Robinson, Amanda's new editor, praised her as a talented writer and a passionate contributor who is most interested in theater.

He told Aol.com that the 27-year-old freelancer works mostly from home, and that he has never met her in person.

So far, Knox's tenure at the paper has been successful. The editor said he has been getting positive feedback about her pieces.
