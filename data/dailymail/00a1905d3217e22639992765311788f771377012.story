In the traditional 'gostra', a game stretching back to the Middle Ages, Maltese young men, women and children have to scrabble their way to the top of a very greasy pole.

If they manage the tricky feat, they need to then uproot one of the flags to claim their hard-won prize.

The comical sight of contestants slithering to victory happens every year on August 25 for the religious feast of St Julian, patron of the town of St Julian's, outside the capital Valletta.

Energetic: A man running up the pole covered in grease during the religious feast in Malta

Skilful: One man manages to grab a flag on the pole in the town of St Julian's

Victory: An agile young man is just inches away from collecting his prize

Celebrations start from days before the actual date, with the town covered in lights and flags.

On the day of the feast, there is a procession around town carrying a statue of St. Julian followed by brass band music .

Then it is time for the climax of the festivities - the much-loved pole competition. 

Residents of all agilities can enter, making it an exciting and unpredictable spectacle. 

From May to September in Malta, there is hardly a weekend when a town or a village is not celebrating the feast of its patron saint or other saints revered in different churches.

Unlucky: It can be very easy to sli right off and take a tumble, much to the amusement of the crowd

Wipeout: The foam and grease comes sliding off as this contestant goes falling into the sea

Popular: The crowd watches an unlucky competitor in the afternoon sunshine
