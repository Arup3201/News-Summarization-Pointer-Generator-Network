Tragic: John Kershaw who slipped and fell off the roof of his home in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, while taking down Christmas lights. He died from his injuries

A company director died after slipping and falling head first from his porch roof while taking down Christmas lights.

John Kershaw's wife Wendy had warned her husband to leave the decorations because she was worried that the roof was slippy, but he insisted on taking them down and fell 10ft on Saturday morning.

Mr Kershaw was found unconscious outside his home in Kidderminster, Worcestershire by his step-son Jonathan, and airlifted to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham.

He died from his injuries on Sunday.

Step-son Jonathan, 24, told how he saw John fall off the roof as he tripped over the guttering.

He said: 'I was leaning out of the window at the time.

'My mum had asked him not to go out there at the time as it was cold and wet and a bit dangerous but he went.

'There's an identical roof at the back that he's up and down all the time and he was fine, it was just the wrong place at the wrong time.

'He was taking down rope lights which we have had up at Christmas for the last six years when he fell off.

He added: 'He slipped backwards and his foot caught the gutter which flipped him onto his back so his head took the full force of the fall.

'He had no broken bones at all, just the blow to the head. It was a tragic accident.

'If he had fallen a couple of feet either side his fall would have been broken by one of the cars.

'It's hit us very very hard, you can't describe how the family has reacted.

'John and my mum had been together for 11 years. He was the kindest, nicest man you could possibly have met, the things me and my brother put them through over the years you can't describe and he was there with every step of the way.'

Devastated Wendy said that it started snowing just as John, who loved snow, died.

She said: 'I told John not to go up on the roof but he said it was fine. It was a waiting game, they [the doctors] said we should prepare ourselves.

'My mum came down with all the family. He died and it had just started snowing.

'John loved the snow. He sent it to me.

Paying tribute to her husband, she added: 'He didn't drink, he didn't smoke and he didn't deserve this.

Devoted: Mr Kershaw is pictured with his wife Wendy, who has described him as a 'thoughtful and romantic' man

'He was one of the best and he'll never be forgotten. I still can't believe he's gone.

'He was so young and such a thoughtful and romantic man.

'John was a very capable person and a real perfectionist. We are all very proud of him.

'He was well loved, a pillar of strength and would do anything for anybody.'

Wendy said added that she would remember Mr Kershaw, a director of Stourport-based company Hillandale Caravans, as 'like a second father' to her two children, Jonathan, aged 24, and Steven Doughty, 21.
