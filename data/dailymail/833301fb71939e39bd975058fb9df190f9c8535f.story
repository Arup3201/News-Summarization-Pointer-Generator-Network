Lucky escape: Leanne Helm rescued her daughter Jessica Cannon only moments before her Skoda went up in flames

A frightened couple have revealed how they fought desperately to free their eight-month-old baby daughter from a burning car.

Leanne Helm, 21, and Callum Cannon, 23, managed to pull Jessica Cannon out of their Skoda Fabia only moments before it was engulfed in flames.

The doors of the car had become jammed and they were only able to rescue the girl by reaching through the window.

The couple were driving home from seeing the Olympic torch relay in Knutsford, Cheshire, when smoke began to plume from the passenger air vent.

Miss Helm stopped the car in Northwich Road, near the Knutsford stately home Tabley House, but the couple then saw sparks coming from the glove box and they could not unlock the doors.

Mr Cannon was eventually able to get his door open, but Miss Helm was trapped inside with their daughter.

Miss Helm said: 'I went to grab my door handle to get out and it wouldn’t open.

'I kept pulling and pulling and I don’t know how but it eventually opened.'

On getting out of the car, Miss Helm started trying to smash open a window but she couldn't break through.

With the dashboard already on fire, the couple then tried a different approach and leaned through the front doors to unwind a window before pulling Jessica through it from her car seat.

Charred: The car was burnt out within 10 minutes after smoke came pluming through a vent

Mystery: Skoda said they would investigate why the car caught fire

The car was completely burned out within 10 minutes. The fire, believed to have been caused by an electrical fault, happened at 11.40am on May 31.

Firefighters put out the blaze and Cheshire Police towed what remained of the vehicle to one of its garages later that day.

Miss Helm said: 'We were lucky to get out when we did because it went straight up after that.'

Miss Helm's mother Jo, 39, and brother Jack, 10, also watched the torchbearing ceremony and received a hysterical phone call on their way home.

The family thanked the emergency services and passers-by, including two women who stopped to help.

Skoda spokesman Catherine Sleigh said: 'We are going to investigate to find the cause of the incident because we want to make sure it’s taken care of.'

A spokesman for Cheshire Fire and Rescue Service said firefighters who attended the scene believed an electrical fault was to blame.
