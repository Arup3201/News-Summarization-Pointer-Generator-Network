My father is responsible for my entire showbusiness career. If he hadn't pushed me to go to King Edward's School in Birmingham, which was, and still is, a very good school, and then on to Cambridge I would never have discovered a talent for comedy.

We lived in Hagley, Birmingham; it was just me and Dad as my parents had split up when I was small. At school, I was drawn to acting and singing, and put together the school revue in 1959, in which I performed my own songs and sketches. I loved hearing an audience laugh - it was and still is a great feeling.

When I went away to Cambridge in 1960 after winning a scholarship to Pembroke College, I met Tim Brooke-Taylor (later to become a writing partner in The Goodies) who was a year older than me, and we rapidly became friends.

John Cleese was two years older than me but started at Downing College at the same time. As they were both in the Footlights, I plucked up the courage to join in my second year. We all got on well and spent hours at the Footlights Club, rehearsing and coming up with ideas.

As I started my third year, I wasn't thinking about what my career might be. But during that autumn term I wrote a song about the singer Adam Faith for the Footlights termly show. It contained some nice word play, and luckily for me someone from the BBC saw it being performed.

I then got a message to call a producer from That Was The Week That Was, the BBC's flagship satirical comedy show. Suddenly I was being offered £30, and one of my songs was going to be on national TV!

It was a penny-dropping moment. I thought, ‘Aha, there might be a career here.' I'd done some holiday work as a scaffolder, but now earning money as an entertainer became a possibility. I remember telling my dad that Christmas, and he was a bit perplexed but pleased; he had wanted me to be a teacher. I was soon bringing in more money doing cabaret performances with my Footlights colleagues in London and Cambridge and my new career as an entertainer started to gather pace.

Then, to all of our surprise, our revue show A Clump Of Plinths, which was later renamed Cambridge Circus, made it to London and we spent the next few months performing at the Lyric Theatre to rave reviews. The cast was me, John Cleese, Tim Brooke-Taylor, Graham Chapman, Jonathan Lynn, David Hatch, Jo Kendall and Chris Stuart-Clark. We then took it to New Zealand and later New York.

After that I got regular writing work for radio shows before Graeme Garden, Tim and I put together The Goodies, which ran for nearly 12 years. I'd never have thought I would have made it in showbusiness but luck and serendipity really played their part in what has turned out to be a marvellous career.
