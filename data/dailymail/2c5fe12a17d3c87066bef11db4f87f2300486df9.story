The ex-wife of one of Google's founders is a self-confessed Scrooge when it comes to spending her fortune.

Anne Wojcicki shares an estimated $30billion (£19.2billion) with her former husband Sergey Brin, making her one of the richest women in Silicon Valley.

Despite this, she admits to loving freebies - and confessed that she used to drink so much complimentary carrot juice at work, it turned her skin orange.

'Because it was expensive I felt I had to maximise the amount that I consumed, so I drank 32oz every day for a year and turned orange,' she told The Sunday Times.

She explains: 'I grew up with my mom being very, very cheap, so when it's free I'm like 'Oh my God, it's free - I have to take as much as I can!'  

As a Wall Street newbie, she earned $40,000 a year, but still managed to save $1,000 a month and took subway rides for fun, simply because they were free. 

While her appearance exudes the wealth she has, she still feels the risk of parking illegally is worth it and never orders drinks in restaurants.  

Despite being one of the richest women in Silicon Valley, Ms Wojcicki admits she loves freebies

She and her former husband Sergey Brin were one of America's richest couples, but bonded over 'growing up cheap'

Now the Yale graduate lives in an extravagant home with a nanny and a chef to tend to her two children in Palo Alto, California, Ms Wojcicki says she misses life on a budget. 

Always maximise consumption when it comes to complimentary drinks. 

Ms Wojcicki says she drank almost a litre of free carrot juice every day for a year - because it was 'expensive'.

She hates it when people order drinks in restaurants, as drink and desserts are where all the margins are made. 

Park illegally on the street as the risk is worth it. Her research shows the 50/50 chance of getting a ticket is worth the fine if it means saving time and cost of a ticket more regularly.

She said: 'I think being on a constraint with money makes you much more creative.' 

Ms Wojcicki met her estranged husband when he and Larry Page used her sister's garage to launch Google as a start-up.

Having bonded over the fact they both grew up 'very cheap' they married in the Bahamas in 2007.

But last year, he ended the marriage and is now in a relationship with British Google executive Amanda Rosenberg.  

Now, Ms Wojcicki, who launched a DNA-testiing company called 23andMe in 2006 is planning to bring it to Britain.

The company offers DNA testing kits for £125, which can identify if you have the genetic markers for conditions, including Alzheimer's.

Last year, she was named America's boldest chief executive by FastCompany magazine.
