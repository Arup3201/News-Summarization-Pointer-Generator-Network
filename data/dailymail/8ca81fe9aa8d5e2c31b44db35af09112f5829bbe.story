A thief who allegedly set three buildings alight tried to escape on a pensioner's canal cruiser - but was forced to give up when he became entangled in Britain's longest lock system.

The man had apparently jumped on board the cruiser to try and flee the trail of destruction he had left behind him. 

But he got stuck when he approached the Caen Hill lock, near Devizes in Wiltshire, Britain's longest lock system, which takes up to six hours to clear.

Despite clearing four of the 29 locks, the fugitive allegedly turned the boat around and then set it on fire.

Pip Flowers, watch manager in charge of Devizes fire station, said: 'It was a very strange night. I don't think we have ever had a trail of arsons quite like it.

'It seems the arsonist thought they could escape on the boat but hadn't reckoned with the Caen Hill flight.

'They went through about four locks leaving them open so that water was escaping and then decided to turn around.

'When we got there it didn't take a lot of putting out. We used the hose reels and two guys in breathing apparatus went inside.'

The man reportedly first set alight a bag of rubbish inside a derelict outbuilding in the grounds of St Peter's School, Devizes, on the evening of July 4.

A shed was then set alight, which saw the fire spread to the roof of an old stables building, before a third blaze was started on a petrol mower in the early hours of the morning.

The thief then allegedly left two violins and a bicycle on a bed and breakfast driveway, before the boat was taken from its moorings at the bottom of the garden.

Boat owner Lionel Gordon, 77, said he was 'very upset' his prized possession had been stolen then torched.

He said: 'I was asked if I knew where my boat was. It was then I found out it had been stolen. I was very upset as I was preparing it to go to a number of regattas.

'From the outside the boat does not look too bad but when you go down in the cabin everything is burnt and blackened.'

Mr Gordon, who is a great-grandfather, bought the boat six years ago when he moved to Devizes.

Among the possessions destroyed was his Merchant Navy cap and badge he earned when he signed up as a 15-year-old.

'I was very sad to lose those and other things such as the flags from the boat were stolen,' he added.

'The boat is my pride and joy. I don't know how long it is going to take to repair.'

A 27-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of arson, burglary and theft of a motor vehicle.

He has been released on police bail. 

Completed in 1810, the two mile stretch of 29 continuous gates are a flight of locks on the Kennet and Avon Canal, between Rowde and Devizes in Wiltshire. 

The locks have a rise of 237 feet and form a two mile stretch.

The lower seven locks run from the Foxhangers Wharf lock to the Foxhangers Bridge lock.

The next 16 locks form a steep flight in a straight line up the hillside. 

This flight of locks was engineer John Rennie's solution to climbing the very steep hill, and was the last part of the canal to be completed.

Each side pond holds a million gallons of water - about two Olympic-sized pools worth.

The locks are one of the 'Seven Wonders of the Waterways'. 

They take five to six hours to travel in a boat and lock 41 is the narrowest on the canal.

The locks became derelict in the 1950s, but after a strong campaign against closure of the canal, followed by a major restoration effort, were reopened by The Queen in August 1990.

The wood from the old gates was donated to Glastonbury Festival and used to build a new bridge which was named in honour of Arabella Churchill, one of the festival's founder.
