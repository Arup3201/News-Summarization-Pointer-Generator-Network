The man who dismembered and cooked up his transgender wife in a horrific murder-suicide was laid to rest in his hometown, with tracks from British super group Queen played at the funeral.

Friends and family of Marcus Volke gathered at Doveton Park Funeral Centre in Ballarat, Victoria, at 2.30pm on Thursday to pay tribute to the 28-year-old.

The iconic band's well-known hits such as 'Killer Queen', 'Another One Bites the Dust' and 'Don't Stop Me Now' were heard blaring from speakers as Volke was remembered as a 'gentle' young man with 'blue eyes', the Herald Sun reported.

It is believed he killed his transgender wife Mayang Prasetyo whose remains were found strewn across the couple's new Teneriffe apartment on October 4

It follows a candlelight vigil held for his Indonesian wife, Mayang Prasetyo, last week in New Farm Park - in Brisbane's inner-city - close to Teneriffe where her remains were found boiling in chemicals on the stove of the couple's apartment.

The gruesome discovery was made by police on October 4 when neighbours in the newly constructed DoubleOne 3 apartment building. 

Instead of sending or bringing flowers to the service, Volke's family asked mourners to donate to mental health service beyondblue.

The 28-year-old's uncle, Wolfgang Volke, told the 250 mourners gathered at the funeral home that his 'caring, loyal and gentle' nephew loved karate and was an avid reader of comic books when he was younger. 

These three pugs were taken from Mayang Prasetyo's apartment after she was brutally murdered 

Other tracks heard at the funeral were Pink Floyd's 'Wish You Were Here' and Metallica's 'Nothing Else Matters', which was played alongside a presentation of photos of Volke during the 45-minute service.

Led Zeppelin's 'Stairway to Heaven' was played as his coffin - made of dark brown pine - was transferred to a hearse.

The funeral service comes more than a week after Volke's father, Peter Volke, took to social media to thank people for their support.

Messages of support and tributes for Volke's family flooded in after the senior Volke wrote: 'Thank you all for your kind support in this difficult time.' 

Friends of Peter Volke and his wife, Dorothy Volke, reached out to the couple via the post.

'We are thinking of you and sending all our love and support... R.I.P Marcus you will be missed xx,' one friend wrote.

Another expressed their shock at the tragedy: 'I know this is a hard time for you and I hope my prayers help you guys. I am still in disbelief, Marcus will be missed so, so much. Love you guys.' 

Earlier this week, it emerged the RSPCA had been inundated with offers to adopt orphaned pugs thought to be left behind by Ms Prasetyo.

The 27-year-old sex worker had started breeding dogs at the couple's upmarket apartment just a month before she was brutally killed at the hands of her husband. 

The couple met Melbourne brothel Pleasure Dome while they were both working as escorts in 2009 

Volke worked at the Pleasure Dome as a male prostitute for about two and a half years before he and Ms Prasetyo both left to work privately in 2012

Details of the couple's life have been slowly pieced together since the tragic murder-suicide.

Since October 4, it has been revealed Volke and Ms Prasetyo met while they were both working at Melbourne brothel Pleasure Dome in 2009.

It had initially been reported the couple met on a cruise while both were working as chefs.

A friend, Alex Devantier, told Daily Mail Australia Volke had told his family and friends that story to cover up the truth.

Volke's working name was Heath XL and described himself as a 'young sexy Australian boy, very friendly and easy going' in an online advertisement.

'I can be your companion for an hour or as long as u want, for a dinner, a hot session, holidays or more,' it said.  

Queensland Police removed a toxic-labelled container from the inner-city apartment, following the gruesome discovery

The grisly death is being treated as a murder-suicide after Volke fled the scene and was later found in an industrial bin with his throat cut

Police also revealed the distinctive stench of boiling human flesh is what led them to the grisly discovery on that Saturday night.  

Even a mix of chemicals could not disguise the smell. It was a vital part of the murder plot that  Volke failed to take into consideration, Brisbane Times reported.

When police arrived at their home, Volke fled the scene and reportedly asked someone on the street if they had seen a man with a knife, in a bid to throw the police off track.

He was later found with his throat slashed and a knife in an industrial bin nearby. 

Nearly a week after police attended the murder scene, mourners gathered to pay tribute to the victim of a horrific crime that shocked Australia and the world.

Candles flickered while 150 people remembered a kind, generous and ambitious woman in New Farm Park in Brisbane, Queensland on Friday. 

The grim details surrounding her death, although well known by those who attended the vigil, were not uttered, instead she was remembered for the legacy she left behind.

Friends shared tales of how generous she was and how she loved 'travelling, she loved good food, good fashion, music, friends

Ms Prasetyo was described as an avid traveller and loved 'good food, good fashion, music, friends'

Ms Mayang's friend Brad Whitehouse shared tales of how generous she was and how she pledged to 'leave the game' once she had turned 30 and had enough money to provide a comfortable life for her family.

'She loved travelling, she loved good food, good fashion, music, friends - being in the hub of her network of friends,' Mr Whitehouse recalled.

'She brought people together.'

While mourners were quick to note Ms Mayang was not defined by her race, gender identity or profession, her story became a rallying point for those who could relate to those aspects of her life.
