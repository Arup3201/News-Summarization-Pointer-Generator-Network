Do you see yourself as a bit rock 'n' roll-style mum while you strut your stuff with your toddlers in tow? 

Or has having kids made you pile the pressure on yourself? Perhaps you're one of those 'always looks amazing in the playground' mothers - and you don't even know it?

Well, it's time to find out. Take this quiz from new mothering bible by Jenny Scott, How To Be A Hip Mama Without Losing Your Cool, and whichever section gives you the most 'yes' answers will determine your maternal style.

Are you a hot eco mum like Gwyneth Paltrow, with Apple (left) or a rock'n'roll mother like Gwen Stefani, with son Apollo (right)? Take the  quiz below to discover what kind of maternal style tribe you belong to

SECTION A

The definitive quiz comes from Jenny Scott's book about retaining your style after motherhood

SECTION B 

SECTION C

SECTION D

MOSTLY SECTION A = YEP, YOU'RE PLAYGROUND MUM 

This is the kind of mum you can normally smell before you see her as she stalks past you in a fog of Chanel, all tousled blonde mane, pouty lip gloss and a perfect glow. 

She is the mum that everyone assumes has an army of helpers, her 4x4 always looks immaculate and it is pretty much guaranteed she wears matching underwear.

The school gates are an opportunity to 'touch base', 'incentivise' and 'go forward' together. 

All the mums want an invitation from Playground Mum, not just to have a nose around her obviously interior-designed home, but also because you've heard rumours you'll have a warm glass of pinot grigio pushed into one hand and a DIY Botox needle in the other.

The playground mum, embodied by Elle Macpherson and Claudia Schiffer, is the most popular kind of mother

MOSTLY SECTION B = HOT ECO MUM 

This is the mum that you can guarantee upon meeting, will leave you feeling guilty about something whether it's that, heaven forbid, you and your kids drink cow's milk, or you've been showering your child in a shower gel containing parabens.

Other than being a mum this woman's job is to save the world through health and fitness fads. 

Smug in the knowledge her healthy lifestyle sets a good example to her kids, she just wishes everyone else would realise that looking and feeling great really isn't hard - even if it does mean a Spinning class in a swimming pool while meditating.

Eco mums like Gwyneth Paltrow look good and still  incorporate their planet saving ways into parenthood

MOSTLY SECTION C = YOU'RE ROCK 'N' ROLL MUM 

She's the kind of mum that doesn't just have your average partner - her partner is the drummer in that hot new band and she has a little black book of friends that include the whole back catalogue of the Nineties' musical heroes.

This mum is never seen in anything that isn't leopard print and is never without a slick of red lippy. She certainly isn't interested in sport or getting fit.

Her favourite kind of night in involves sitting with a bottle of beer surrounded by vinyl talking about the good old days when Courtney and Kurt had just met. 

This mum rarely has time to stand around talking at the school gates – being rock 'n' roll cool is a full-time occupation.

The rock 'n' roll mum exudes effortless cool and never leaves the house without her trusted red lippy

MOSTLY SECTION D = YOU'RE A MOTHERS MEETING MUM 

This is the mum who wants it all, and more than any other kind of mum she puts way too much pressure on herself.

It's not enough to just be a good mother, it's just as important to feel confident and look good - these mums are very proud.

She sees absolutely no reason why having kids should mean letting yourself go. In fact, since having hers, she's dropped two dress sizes, run two marathons and started her own company. 

But by no means is this lady competitive she is the kind of friend every woman needs in their lives! 

She's supportive, inspiring and motivating and loves having an early night with a good book as much as she likes to have a wild night out.

More than any other kind of mama the mother's meetings mum puts way too much pressure on herself

Jenny Scott is the founder of Mothers Meeting and has now launched an inspirational book on motherhood 

When a woman embarks on the whole new world of motherhood, it can be an overwhelming time. 

Some may seem to take to it like a duck to water - but you can be sure they're paddling like crazy beneath those deceptively serene waters.

Other women openly throw their hands in the air in 'this is just too hard' exasperation (and exhaustion).

But what most have in common is the underlying fear that their lives will disappear into a fug of daytime TV and mindless web surfing while feeding and changing nappies.

One of those mums was Jenny Scott, 32, who lives in London. Jenny was already a successful graphic designer and after the birth of her first son, she found herself searching for support groups to meet women intent on embracing motherhood while sharing similar interests and hobbies. 

In the end she decided to create her own and Mothers Meeting was born.

Jenny says: 'When I had my son at 28, everything changed. I thought I was prepared but in reality I had no idea of the challenges of motherhood. 

'I decided to search out a new social group to meet mums with same interests and who were embracing motherhood as a new exciting chapter in their lives. 

'But the more I looked the more I realised there was nothing out there for mamas like me. There was nothing out there that spoke to mothers like women, not just 'mums'.

'I'm so happy I went with my gut instinct as my business has grown from something that started out from organising an exhibition visit with a couple of other mums, to organising huge festivals, partnering with Nike.

'Our events are aimed at empowering women, whether it's a workshop to learn the importance of body language at something such as a job interview or a hypnotherapy session to teach yourself how to be more confident. 

'We even have a book club, a running club and lots of regional events.'

Jenny says How To Be a Hip Mama Without Losing Your Cool is about 'celebrating real women doing the hardest job in the world' and brings together the network of amazing women Jenny's met along the way.

Each woman shares her honest advice on embracing motherhood while keeping her own identity. 

Plus there's no shying away from the challenging subjects of breast feeding, maternity leave and the baby blues.
