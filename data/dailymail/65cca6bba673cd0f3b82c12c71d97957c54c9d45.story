A homeless man whose one wish this holiday season was to find a family to spend Thanksgiving with so he would not be alone got just what he wished for on Thursday - and more.

Neal Shytles, who lives in a shelter in Norfolk, Virginia, had the chance to break bread and gobble up some turkey with Ashley McLemore and her husband Cory, a military couple from nearby Newport News who said they understood what it was like to be away from family during the holidays.

And it wasn't just a meal Neil got, with the amazing couple also handing him something else after the meal.

More than words: An emotional Neal broke down thanks to the military couple's generosity 

Amazing folks: After the meal, Cory gave Neal a $400 gift card for staples that he purchased with money he and his coworkers raised 

Thanks to some generous donations from his coworkers, Cory gave Neil a gift card for $400 to buy himself some necessities like new clothes.

The two men hit it off the second Cory picked him up at the shelter, with Neil enveloping him in a bear hug. 

And now it seems like Neil is a part of the McLemore family, even carving the turkey on Thursday.

'He is a wonderful person who is selfless and I’m so blessed that he’s going to be part of our family,' said Ashley.

As for the gift card, that was just too much for Neil, who broke down in tears and hugged Ashley as he said, 'You didn’t have to do this. I just wanted a meal.'

Even better, because of Neil's plea and the altruism of the McLemores, the donations have been pouring in for the Union Mission, where Neil stays.

'I hope people learn that the homeless are not what sometimes you picture the homeless to be,' Neal told WTKR. 

'I could sit there and just cry because people are doing so much for the homeless now.'
