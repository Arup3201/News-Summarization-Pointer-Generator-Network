Shrewsbury Town host Jose Mourinho's star-studded Chelsea squad in the Capital One Cup fourth round on Tuesday night in front of a record crowd.

Thanks to financial help from the cup sponsor, Shrewsbury have installed temporary seating for the clash and due to demand will break through the 10,000 capacity barrier at their Greenhous Meadow Stadium for the first time.

The 486 home seats, split across two areas of the stadium, has enabled more Shrews fans the chance to watch the League 2 side's dream tie with the Premier League leaders.

Matt Williams, chief executive of Shrewsbury Town Football Club, said: 'The tie with Chelsea has really captured the imagination of our fans, wherever you go in the town people are talking about it.

'The demand in tickets has been huge and to be able to accommodate an extra 486 fans is fantastic. We're hugely grateful to Capital One as this wouldn't have been possible without its financial support.'

Jason Carr, head of sponsorship at Capital One, said: 'As soon as we heard that the club wanted additional seating, we were determined to help.

'This is one of the biggest games in Shrewsbury Town's recent history and we're delighted that we can help as many fans as possible be there at the stadium to watch the match live. It should be a night to remember.'

The League Two side are the lowest-ranked team left in the League cup ahead of the fourth round tie and haven't beaten the Blues since winning 2-0 on New Year's Day in 1983.
