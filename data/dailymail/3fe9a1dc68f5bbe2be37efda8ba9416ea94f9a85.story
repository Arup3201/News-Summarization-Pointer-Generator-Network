A training memo issued to Border Patrol agents appeared to tell them that they should not detain drunk drivers on one of the busiest sections of the US-Mexico border.

The Department of Homeland Security memo told Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) agents in the Tucson, Arizona, sector of the border that they have three options when they encounter intoxicated drivers: detain them at the request of local law enforcement, detain them without the involvement of another agency or let them go on their way.

US Border Patrol agents in Arizona received a training memo that appeared to tell them they should let drunk drivers go on their way due to fears of a civil suit and a jurisdictional grey area with local law enforcement

The memo examined the civil liability of each of the three options, given that Border Patrol has no legal authority to arrest drunk drivers.

It acknowledged that  it may feel counter-intuitive for an agent to let a drunk driver go on their way.

'There is no legal requirement for a Border Patrol agent to intervene in a state crime, including DUI,' and 'therefore there is generally no liability that will attach to the agent or agency for failing to act in this situation'.

Should local law enforcement officers ask for an individual to be detained, border agents have no duty to detain the suspect - and doing so can increase the civil liability for the agent and the agency.

However, the memo goes on to say that policy is to cooperate with local and state law enforcement officers who alert Border Patrol of suspected violations under state law.

Local Border Patrol remember agent Michael Gallagher who was killed by a drunk driver in 2010. It is unlikely they would let a drunk driver go today

The third option is to detain a drunk driver with no request from local law enforcement. This poses the greatest liability for the agent and agency in the form of a civil law suit, according to the memo.

Only by letting a drunk driver go free is the agent and agency free from liability.

The memo does concede that an officer who chooses to detain a drunk driver is still 'acting within the course and scope of his employment'.

Conservative groups have been quick to decry the contents of the memo which was first brought to light by Judicial Watch. 

'Families across America are now at risk on the roads, as President Obama and his appointees at the Department of Homeland Security have given illegal aliens a license to drive drunk,' said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton.

However, Art Del Cueto, president of the Local 2544, the union that represents Border Patrol agents, told CBS 5: 'I can assure you that the agents I represent and the people I work with just would not release someone who was severely intoxicated.' 

He added that agents carry a certain moral authority after the 2010 death of agent Michael Gallagher near Casa Grande. Gallagher was killed on duty by a drunk driver.

'Especially since we were hit hard by the death of one of our own. How could we release them?' Del Cueto said.

The group Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), said in a statement: 'MADD urges all law enforcement officers to protect the public by following standard procedures when encountering anyone suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Law enforcement is the first line of defense in preventing drunk and drugged driving, and their efforts are crucial to keep our roadways safe.'

Customs and Border Patrol released a statement to make clear that the intent of the memo was to inform agents of their legal options when encountering drunk drivers based on judicial precedent, 'not direct [them] to detain or not detain these drivers'.

'In cases where Border Patrol agents encounter possibly impaired drivers, they are trained to exercise their professional judgment when assessing the current situation.'
