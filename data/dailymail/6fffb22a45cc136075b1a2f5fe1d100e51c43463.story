Zaffar Abbas (pictured) orchestrated at least five sham marriages between Eastern Europeans and Indian nationals

The leader of a sham marriage ring who used his immigration expertise to organise the scam was yesterday sentenced to six years behind bars.

Zaffar Abbas, 45, from Walsall, orchestrated at least five sham marriages between Eastern Europeans and Indian nationals over a six-month period.

One of those involved was a resident of James Turner Street in Birmingham – which featured on last year’s Channel 4 documentary, Benefits Street.

Marcella Brotac, who lives on the road, was also jailed for attempting to participate in one of the fake ceremonies.

Brotac, 37, from Romania, even posed for photographs with her sham husband Harjeet Singh, 23, in an attempt to convince immigration officials.

Under Abbas's scheme, EU passport-holders were paid to marry foreign nationals desperate to stay in the UK.

The charge for each wedding, held at Shrewsbury Register office, was up to £12,000.

Sentencing yesterday at Northampton Crown Court, Judge Rupert Mayo described Abbas, who is a British national, as ‘clever’ and ‘persuasive’.

A court heard that the father-of-three had previously worked as a ‘licensed immigration adviser’ which had given him insider knowledge when planning the marriages.

Judge Mayo told Abbas: ‘The offence you committed on at least five occasions was a sham marriage between a person of EU citizenship and a person who did not necessarily live in the UK.’

He later added: ‘You are clever and persuasive but you are also manipulative.’

He told of how Abbas had had put ‘a great deal of planning and coercion’ into the marriages.

Mr Mayo also told of how Abbas had carefully planned for his name not to appear in any certificates and had even used a separate address.

Beth Crocker, defending, told of how Abbas had ‘struggled hugely’ since being jailed in December and was ‘extremely frightened’ by his new surroundings.

She told of how her client had spent the time behind bars studying and completing education qualifications.

Abbas, wearing a smart black coat and a pink shirt sobbed as he listened the verdict as it was translated by an interpreter.

Abbas was one of seven put behind bars yesterday for their involvement in the marriage ring. 

Singh, from West Bromwich, had agreed to marry Brotac so that he could stay in Britain after his student visa had expired.

Davinder Singh, a Slovakian through marriage, was another key fixer in the ploy

The pair, who met at a registry office for the first time to arrange the fake nuptials, posed for the pictures after they had been arrested.

Brotac and Singh had agreed to the pictures after being convinced by Abbas, the court heard.

Earlier in the trial, Stephen Thomas, prosecuting told jurors that the photos were a ‘complete sham’, The Birmingham Mail newspaper reported.

He told the court: ‘These photos created for the sole purpose of trying to pull the wool over the eyes of the immigration authorities that there was a relationship between Harjeet Singh and Marcella Brotac.’

Brotac was sentenced to 18 months behind bars and Singh to 16 months for their involvement in the ploy.

Brotac, who speaks no English, was told the news by her Romanian interpreter. 

She sobbed throughout the sentencing, wiping her eyes with a handkerchief and biting her lip as she waited for a verdict.

Registry office staff began to become suspicious of the scheme when they noticed couples could not communicate in the same language.

Many also appeared disinterested in the person they were due to marry.

Davinder Singh, a Slovakian through marriage was another key fixer in the ploy. He was sentenced to two years and five months yesterday.

Singh, 40, from Handsworth on the outskirts of Birmingham, had married off his Slovakian wife, who was pregnant with his child, to his cousin as part of the scheme. Judge Mayo branded Singh’s actions ‘distasteful’ yesterday.

Vladimir Gazi, 40, from Slovakia, Ivars Mizans, 34, from Latvia and Gurpreet Kaur, 25, from India, were also jailed for 16 months yesterday.

A court heard of how Kaur had met Abbas and been convinced to marry an EU national because she feared returning to Pakistan.

She believed her father would stone her to death after he discovered that she had had a sexual relationship with a man in the village, a court heard.

The Home Office hailed the sentences a success last night.

Andy Radcliffe from the government department’s criminal investigations unit said:

Gurpreet Kaur, 25, from India, was also jailed for 16 months

‘Abbas and Singh set up this scam to profit from abusing the marriage system and the UK’s immigration laws but have ended up in prison.

‘These sentences show that sham marriage crime will not be tolerated. Whether you are an organiser or a participant, we will always act when abuse of the immigration system is uncovered and seek to prosecute those involved.’

Immigration minister James Brokenshire said: ‘We are building an immigration system which is fair to British citizens and legitimate immigrants, and tough on those who flout the law.

‘These figures send a clear message to anyone who thinks they can cheat our immigration system. Our specialist teams will catch you, and you will be brought to justice.

‘Last year, we intervened in more than 2,400 suspected sham marriages – 85 per cent more than the year before. 

'The new Immigration Act is also making it even tougher for fraudsters by extending the marriage and civil partnership notice period – giving officers and registrars longer to investigate suspicious marriages.’

All of those involved in the scam could face deportation apart from British national Abbas.

Although Brotac lives on James Turner Street, where Benefits Street is filmed,her barrister yesterday insisted that the Romanian national was a hard worker and had never claimed benefits.

Dean Easthope, defending, told of how Brotac had moved to England in 2013.

He said: ‘To her credit, she didn’t rely upon benefits.’

He also told of how she carried out ‘back-breaking’ work to pay her bills.

Mr Easthope added: ‘She doesn’t really understand what is going on. She doesn’t really have any idea what is going to face her.’

He added: ‘The cultural and language difficulties that she experiences in prison are horrific.’
