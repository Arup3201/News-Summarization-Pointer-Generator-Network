A 14-year-old boy says he was sodomized by fellow players on his suburban Chicago high school soccer team as part of a horrific hazing ritual that dates back four years.

The student's mother is suing Maine West High School in Des Plaines, Illinois, claiming that the coaches sanctioned the sexual assault of her son and at least two other boys in September, during school hours.

The furious parent appeared in a dramatic press conference on Monday wearing sunglasses and a baseball cap pulled low across her face to hide her identity and protect the anonymity of her child.

Ritual: The attorney for the boy and his family says the Maine West High School soccer team has done the hazing ritual for the past four years

'I thought my son would be safe at school,' she said, her voice quivering. 'You think when you drop off your son, it's a safe place to be. But I feel like the coaches should have kept him safe on the soccer field, and they didn't do that.'

Her lawyer, Antonio Romanucci, says the high school freshman was attacked on September 27 on school property when he and two other boys were promoted to the varsity soccer team, according to ABC7 TV in Chicago.

Discipline: Head coach Mike Divincenzo and four other coaches have been fired or reassigned

He claims that the teens were shoved to the ground and beaten by the older members of the varsity team. The players then held them down, pulled down their pants, tore off their underwear and sodomized each of them. 

The coaches supported the hazing 
ritual, Mr Romanucci says, by ordering a 'campus run' after the three 
freshman made the senior team, the Daily Herald reports.

A Des Plaines police investigation of the incident led to six students being sent to juvenile court to face hazing charges.

The school district said it has disciplined ten students.

Two coaches who are also teachers at 
the high school, head coach Mike Divincenzo and varsity coach Emilo 
Rodriguez, have been transferred with pay, pending the outcome of a 
school district investigation.

Three other coaches have been fired. 

Mr Romanucci, the attorney who filed 
the lawsuit on behalf of the student and his parents, said the hazing 
practice has taken place at the school for the last four years.

'That behavior, in today's society, is disgusting,' he said. 'It should never be condoned. It should never have happened.'
