It's the type of topping you would expect to find served with apple pie, not in a cocktail.

But an alcoholic drink made from Birmingham's most famous dessert, Bird's Custard, has scooped a top award - and is guaranteed to get you pie-eyed.

Concocted by bartender Robert Wood of Birmingham's The Edgbaston Hotel, the Local Legend is filled with local ingredients.

Award winner: Bartender Robert Wood with his cocktail, the Local Legend

The 31-year-old came out tops from 10 hopefuls at the contest to find Birmingham's best cocktail, staged at the Lost and Found pub in Bennett's Hill.

Robert's drink included honey sourced in Birmingham and Bird's Custard, once made in what is now the Custard Factory.

There's also a hint of toffee and cream and the kick is provided by Langley's gin.

It took Robert, originally from Manchester, three weeks to create.

He said: 'I wanted to create something unique to Birmingham and unique to us. The base is gin, lemon and honey.

Stuart Insall owner of The Edgbaston on Highfield Road, said: 'Though not surprised, we are delighted to walk away with this prize having just opened The Edgbaston.

In the mix: Robert creating his custard-based cocktail which has won an award

'Robert's skills are unsurpassed and this award is a welcome addition to the range of awards our sister hotel and cocktail lounge, The Kenilworth, has amassed.

'We are looking forward to welcoming people to The Edgbaston to experience our unique blend of delicious cocktails and discreet personal service.'

It was not only Robert's cocktail skills that wowed judges. They were impressed by his local knowledge, particularly of the city's industrial heritage.

As a prize, the Local Legend - inspired by the classic Bee's Knees cocktail - will be served at Birmingham Independent Food Fair in September.

Local Legend is on offer at The Edgbaston for £9.
