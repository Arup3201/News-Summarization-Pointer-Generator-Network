Two men have been arrested over an alleged imminent plot to murder two South Australian judges in retribution.

The judges' homes and that of a senior police officer were also to be destroyed as part of the revenge attack, police say.

The men, aged 63 and 44 and both from Murray Bridge, southeast of Adelaide, were arrested on Sunday after what major crime detectives described as 'a sophisticated investigation' over two months.

Both have been charged with conspiracy to murder and conspiracy to commit arson on a home thereby endangering life.

'This was a planned attack on two State institutions - the police and the judiciary,' major crime Detective Inspector Greg Hutchins said.

The men have been remanded in custody and will appear in the Murray Bridge Magistrates Court on Monday, where it's expected police will allege the men planned the offences as retribution and that the 63-year-old offered to pay the 44-year-old to carry out the crimes.

Det Insp Hutchins said police feared the attacks were about to take place.

'The operation culminated due to the risks involved and information that an attack was imminent,' he said.

'As the pair is now before the courts on very serious charges we are limited in what can be said about the process and nature of the investigation.

'However, I can say that at all times the safety of those being targeted, and that of their families, was our very highest priority.

'There's no doubt this was a very stressful situation for them and they have managed it with absolute professionalism.

Det Insp Hutchins said the safety of those involved is still being monitored.

Over 25 police officers were involved in the arrests of the two men on Sunday and Police have not ruled out further arrests.
