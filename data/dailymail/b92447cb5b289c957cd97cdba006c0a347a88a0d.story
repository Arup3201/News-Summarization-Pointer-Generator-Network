Tony Pulis has rejected an offer to take charge of Saudi Arabian side Al Ittihad.

The 56-year-old has been out of work since quitting Crystal Palace just two days before the start of the season.

Pulis is keen to make a return to the Premier League instead but he has received no contact from QPR as speculation about Harry Redknapp's future continues.
