QPR striker Loic Remy has been bailed after he was arrested on suspicion of rape.

The 26-year-old France international was being held by Scotland Yard's sex crime squad together with two other men.

Three men have been bailed until September, the Metropolitan Police said today.

A 34-year-old woman alleges that three men raped her on May 6 in west London.

A spokesman for the Metropolitan 
Police said yesterday: 'Officers from Sapphire are investigating an 
allegation of rape which happened on May 6 in the west London area.

'The allegation was passed on to the 
Metropolitan Police Service by Kent Police on 8 May after the 
34-year-old female victim reported it to them on the previous day, 7 
May.

'The victim alleges she was raped by three men.

'On the morning of Wednesday, 15 May 
three men, aged 26, 23 and 22, were arrested at an address in Fulham on 
suspicion of rape - they remain in custody at a west London police 
station.'

Remy, who is paid £80,000 a week, joined QPR in January for £8million but was unable to help the team avoid relegation from the Premier League.

He is expected to leave the west 
London club this summer, with top clubs such as Arsenal, Tottenham and 
Liverpool reported to be interested in signing him.

Remy will hope to be available for the already-relegated Rangers' final game of the season away at Liverpool on Sunday.

A
QPR spokesman said yesterday: 'The club is aware of the allegations 
regarding Loic Remy, but due to police investigations is unable to 
comment.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
