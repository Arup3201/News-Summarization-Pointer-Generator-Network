A Florida man had something more exotic in mind than chicken wings and chips and dip when putting together a menu for his Super Bowl feast Sunday.

Police in Central Florida say 30-year-old Richard Nixie killed five small alligator for his Game Day meal.

Nixie, a convicted felon with a lengthy rap sheet, was taken into custody Sunday afternoon at his home in the town of Debary, just hours before the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks took the field in Phoenix.

Oh, snap! Police in Central Florida say 30-year-old Richard Nixie killed five small alligator for his Super Bowl dinner 

Exotic menu: Wildlife officials say Nixie admitted to trapping gators less than 5 feet in length (similar to the one pictured in stock image) and chopping off their tails for dinner

Officials with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission told the Daytona Beach News-Journal Nixie admitted to trapping gators less than 5 feet in length and chopping off their tails for dinner.

He has been charged with possession and taking alligators without a proper tag.

Nixie was released from Volusia County Jail after posing $500 bond. He is due back in court March 3.

He's been arrested at least eight times over the past 12 years on a laundry list of charges, including trafficking in stolen property; grand theft; armed burglary; possession of marijuana; driving on a suspended license and disorderly conduct
