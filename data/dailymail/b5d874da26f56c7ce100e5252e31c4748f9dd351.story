Damning emails sent from a socialite to a trusted friend have revealed that she was 'terrified' of her teenage daughter in the months before she was murdered.  

Sheila von Weise Mack wrote to longtime confidante Elliott Jacobson on numerous occasions between 2013-14 about the violent episodes of her daughter, Heather Mack, 19, who is currently on trial for her mother's murder in Bali, Indonesia.

In one email, shared with The Chicago Tribune, the 62-year-old wrote: 'Heather was violent again... Smashed several items in my home, threw things at me and left... Heather is in grave danger - and so am I.'

Heather Mack faces life in prison - or even death by firing squad - if convicted of the premeditated murder of her mother last August. Her boyfriend, 21-year-old Tommy Schaefer, also has been charged with murder.

Mrs von Wiese Mack's badly-beaten body was found in a blood-spattered suitcase in the trunk of a taxi at the luxury St. Regis Hotel in Bali on August 12. She had been on vacation with her daughter and Schaefer at the time. 

They have told police that Mrs von Wiese Mack objected after finding out about her daughter’s pregnancy and during a fierce argument, Schaefer struck Heather’s mother with the metal handle of a fruit bowl while her daughter hid in the bathroom.

However in her emails to Mr Jacobson, it appeared that Mrs von Wiese Mack was aware that her daughter was pregnant before they left on the Bali vacation. 

The teen had also stolen heard mother's credit cards at this time and unknown to her run up a $4,000 bill throwing a party at a Chicago hotel, Mrs von Wiese-Mack wrote in an email.

'She is really a master at manipulation and lying,' the mother wrote to a friend. 'She will stop at nothing to get at my money.'

On Tuesday, Heather Mack gave birth to a baby girl via Caesarean at Sanglah Hospital in Denpasar.

In exclusive pictures, obtained by Daily Mail Online, Mack was seen at the window of her hospital room a day after giving birth to her 6lb 1oz daughter, Stella Schaefer, the last name being that of the baby's father and her co-accused.

The accused murderers have claimed in court that the unborn baby had been at the center of problems.

However, emails provided by Mr Jacobson to The Chicago Tribune, revealed that Heather Mack had a long history of violent outbursts, stealing and manipulative behavior.

In March 2014, Mrs von Wiese Mack wrote in a string of emails to her longtime friend about her teenage daughter's explosive rages.

'Her anger escalates at an alarming rate and she seems to have no control over it - very scary. At least she didn't hit me - her rage went to the window instead,' she wrote, according to The Tribune. 

In another email she wrote: 'Heather ran away again tonight. She will not answer her phone. She will not answer emails and she told me that she would kill me and then kill herself ... I feel so desperate.' 

In one chilling message to her friend, Mrs von Wiese Mack wrote: 'I am really scared of what she may do next.'  

Mr Jacobson, 72, who worked in politics, passed on the emails to the Tribune so that his friend's voice may be heard, he reportedly said.

Earlier this week Mack had given birth in a Caesarean operation to her 6lb 1oz daughter, Stella Schaefer, the surname being after the father and her co-accused 21-year-old Tommy Schaefer

Heather Mack and Tommy Schaefer, from Chicago, Illinois, (pictured in court on March 12) are being tried separately by the Denpasar District Court. They could both face a firing squad if found guilty of her mother's brutal murder last August

Although Miss Mack was not considered a flight risk,  she remains under guard at all time, no matter what the circumstances, at the Sanglah Hospital with her baby beside her in a cot.

Joining her in the hospital room were the child's grandmother, Tommy Schaefer's mother, and other relatives and friends who had flown from their homes in Chicago.

And it is from his mother and relatives that Schaefer will have to rely for a first-hand description of his baby, for he has been refused the right to travel under guard from Kerobokan Prison to the hospital.

Prison sources said he was 'pacing up and down with frustration' in his cell as he anxiously waits for the moment when he will first set eyes on his daughter.

‘He’s going crazy in there, wanting to see his daughter, but he’s been told he's a prisoner on a serious charge and there will be no hospital visits,’ a prison source said.

Unless the prison grants him a special privilege to see the baby, he is unlikely to see her until - and if - Miss Mack takes the child with her to their next scheduled court appearance on March 24.

There is every likelihood of the couple’s next court appearance - their cases are being held separately - being adjourned while she regains the strength to face the judges in the Denpasar District Court.

Miss Mack earlier had expressed fears that she would have to deliver the baby behind bars because she did not have a down payment that the hospital wanted up front.

But her U.S. attorney, Anthony Scifo, has told the Chicago Tribune that he was able to send money to Indonesia earlier in the week after working out a deal with Miss Mack’s uncle, who controls $1.56 million in a trust fund set up for her by her murdered mother. 

Miss Mack does not have access to the money before her 30th birthday. 

Miss Mack planned to keep the baby with her in the cell for the maximum allowed period of two years - unless there are dramatic developments in the case against her and she is able to leave the notorious prison.

It was not known when she will be returned to the prison with her baby, but hospital staff suggested it could be within the next 48 hours.

Mack had earlier told friends who have been supporting her during jail visits that she was expecting her baby in April. This means the child was born prematurely.

Last week,  Schaefer told the trial that he had been attacked by Wiese-Mack and called a racially offensive slur.

He said that his relationship with Heather was not endorsed by her mother and he went to Bali to decide how to tell her they were pregnant.

After meeting with Mack at the hotel, they discussed how to inform Mrs von Wiese-Mack that Mack was pregnant and agreed to meet in the hotel room where Mack and her mother were staying.

Speaking through an interpreter, Schaefer said Mack asked him to bring a metal fruit bowl, which he hid under his shirt as a 'precaution'.

Asked by a judge why it was hidden, Schaefer answered that he was not sure whether he would use it or not to protect himself.

According to Schaefer, he arrived in the room and found Miss Mack weeping. He did not know why, but also saw her mother was screaming.

'She (von Wiese-Mack) was angry at me when she knew that Heather was pregnant,' Schaefer said, while trying to hold back tears.

Miss Mack, who was sitting beside her lawyer, sobbed at the testimony.

He said that the victim insulted him using a racial slur and described her daughter as a prostitute who liked a black man.

He said the situation got heated when Mrs von Wiese-Mack asked her daughter for an abortion or to kill the unborn baby. Schaefer said that led to a quarrel in which Mr von Wiese-Mack strangled him hard for about 30 seconds.

'I was angry, I took the fruit bowl and hit her,' Schaefer said, in tears.

He added that he did not remember how many times he hit the victim. After acknowledging she wasn't breathing, he tried to give her artificial respiration, while Mack, who had run in panic into the bathroom for about three minutes, came back and tried to revive her mother.

He said he was trembling and scared and called 911 on his mobile phone before realizing that he was not in the United States.

In her first questioning in court last Wednesday, Mack, who is eight months' pregnant, said Schaefer beat her mother with a metal soup bowl after von Wiese-Mack made the threat in an argument.

'The blow was not so hard ... and my mother was still resisting,' Miss Mack said. 'I asked Tommy to stop and then I ran into the bathroom.'

The 62-year-old's bludgeoned body was folded in half and stuffed into a suitcase with bloody sheets. 

In January, Mack had said she vowed to bring the baby up in the cramped Bali prison she shares with six others.

She has told fellow prisoners in the Wijaya Kusuma cell block of her intentions - but that has not gone down well with several of the other women.

'Make arrangements to get your baby out of here,' one prisoner was reported to have angrily told her. 'We're fed up with being woken by crying babies.'

In an adjoining cell a prisoner in her late 30s was raising a baby which cries through the night, waking other inmates.

'This is what your baby is going to be doing - waking us up - and we don't want that,' Heather was told by one woman - according to visitors leaving the prison after delivering food to relatives in the women's section of the notorious prison.

The protests, however, have failed to dampen the resolve of Mack.
