The fitness bug is obviously catching among the cast of Made In Chelsea.

Last month we revealed that Spencer Matthews was training for next month’s New York Marathon – now his co-star Binky Felstead has started an intensive new regime and  is working out seven days a week.

The pretty brunette, is now a regular at the upmarket Equinox Gym in Kensington, West London, where she has signed up for a one-hour class called The Workx.

Re-made in Chelsea: Binky Felstead have chosen to join a new gym to sculpture her body

It involves running on a treadmill, followed by dumbbell exercises and those aimed at improving core strength.

The 24-year-old has also been spotted lifting weights with a personal trainer. Let’s hope that  the men of SW3 don’t get on  Binky’s wrong side.

The secret to beating symptoms of the menopause could be all in the mind.

In
 a new book, Myra Hunter, professor of health psychology at King’s 
College London, argues that negative perceptions about the menopause can
 mean that women panic and become flustered when  they have a hot flush,
 making the symptoms much worse.

But
 cognitive behavioural therapy – a type of counselling that works by 
replacing  negative thoughts with positive ones – can help to change 
this thought process, enabling women to better manage and reduce the 
condition,  says Prof Hunter.

Fit for fight: Workout machine designer Alan Shearer on the pitch

Former England and Newcastle United  striker Alan Shearer has his sights set on a business idea aimed at solving the nation’s obesity epidemic.

Alan has developed a new fitness workout machine called the Speedflex with former Newcastle physio Paul Ferris and businessman Graham Wylie.

The high-tech machines respond to an individual’s force as opposed to the amount of weights you add to them.

So if you push or pull the overhead bar harder, it will resist your body weight and force you to exert yourself more.

This means that unfit people can take classes alongside professionals as each machine works to the individual’s ability.

Classes will take place in Speedflex centres, which are being rolled out across the UK.

Cheating and getting away  with it feels great, says a new study from the University of Washington.

Research
 published by the American Psychological Association found that the 
assumption that people feel remorse from cheating is false.

Many people actually feel good  – even describing it as a natural high – as long as they’re not hurting anyone.

The
 study looked at 1,000 people in their late 20s and 30s  in the US and 
England. Just over half of those participating were men.

The
 volunteers were given mathematical and word-puzzle tests, some of which
 were virtually impossible –  such as determining that the letters 
‘unaagt’ were an anagram for taguan, a species  of flying squirrel. 
Previous testing had shown  that the likelihood of solving the problems 
correctly was minuscule.

Participants
 were also handed the answers to the problems during the test but were 
told  ‘not to look at them’, thereby allowing them to cheat.

Half
 the participants got the question right – meaning a high proportion 
must have cheated, claim the researchers – and all said they felt good 
about it.

‘Showing people 
experience positive emotions when cheating is a novel finding,’ says Dr 
Daniel Frings, senior lecturer in psychology at London South Bank 
University. ‘Unfortunately,  it chimes with other research showing that 
when faced with dilemmas, people don’t always behave in ways beneficial 
to society,’ he says.
