Umenyiora, who was born in London, will line up for the Falcons against the Detroit Lions on Sunday in front of over 80,000 fans at Wembley Stadium.

The 32-year-old spent his early years in England before his parents moved to Nigeria and then to Alabama in the United States.

Now in his 12th season in the NFL, Umenyiora has won two Super Bowls with the New York Giants and appeared in two Pro Bowls.

The defensive end moved to the Falcons in 2013 having spent a decade with the Giants and he appeared in the first International Series contest at Wembley against the Miami Dolphins in 2007 - which New York won 13-10.

He said: 'It's my second time coming back to England and it is a dream come true for me. I hadn't been back to London at all when I left and it had been over 20 years. Coming back in 2007 was a great experience for me.

'All I can remember about England was the weather and the rain because I was seven when I left.' 

The Falcons will be making their first trip to England for an International Series contest as they take on the Lions in the first ever lunchtime kick-off at Wembley. 

The Falcons landed at Gatwick Airport on Monday morning and will practice at Arsenal's Colney base this week ahead of their game against the Lions on Sunday.
