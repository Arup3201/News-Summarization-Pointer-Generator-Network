When it comes to style, few would argue that top designer Tom Ford has it in spades. 

So no surprise that the fashion guru's former home in Chelsea, London, has a certain je ne sais quoi. 

The stylish apartment, where the American lived between 1994 and 2004 whilst heading up Gucci, is now on the market for a cool £1.15m with estate agents Strutt and Parker - who say having a famous former tenant is proving a big draw for the property.

The designer is now  based across the pond but there are still plenty of stylish neighbours to rub designer shoulders with - Adele, Kylie Minogue and Frank Lampard among them.

Arranged over two floors and flooded with light, the 900sqft apartment has a bright and airy feel.

The apartment has been updated since the designer left more than a decade ago. 

When the current owners did refurbished the property they claim that they found a number of Gucci material samples with handwritten notes.

The cool apartment located in Redcliffe Gardens in SW10 has a master bedroom and en-suite, an open-plan reception room and kitchen and a stunning roof terrace.

Up the spiral staircase there's a further bedroom and shower room and access to the roof terrace with view across the city.

Wooden floors and industrial style lamps and staircase give the pad a the cool factor - as does the muted colour palette.

The 53-year-old designer has a degree in architecture, so perhaps it's the apartment's stylish split-level structure that appealed. 

Apparently parcels apparently still arrive for the designer from time to time - so you never know what unexpected extras might be thrown in for the £1.15m price-tag.

Simon Rose, Head of Strutt & Parker in West Chelsea, said: 'This flat is special for a number of reasons. 

'A stone's throw from the Kings Road, it's been recently refurbished, it split over two levels linked by a cool spiral staircase and features a fabulous private roof terrace perfect for summer parties. 

'Having a famous ex owner always helps generate a buzz and it's certainly providing a talking point with prospective buyers.'
