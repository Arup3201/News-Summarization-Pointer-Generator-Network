A historic chapel is set to be restored following centuries of neglect, after it was sold by the Queen for just £1.

St James's Church stands in an abandoned hamlet on the banks of the River Wye, and came close to falling apart as the area became wild and overgrown.

But the Crown Estate, which manages £8billion worth of land belonging to the royal family, has sold it for a nominal sum on condition that it is returned to its former glory.

Historic: St James's Church in the abandoned hamlet of Lancaud, Gloucestershire has been sold by the Crown Estate for just £1

Setting: The church can be seen at the centre of this photograph of the bucolic landscape which surrounds it on the banks of the River Wye

The church, in the now disappeared village of Lancaut in Gloucestershire, has been bought by the Forest of Dean Buildings Preservation Trust.

They will spend £50,000 to 'stabilise' the 12th-century church, whose origins lie in the Anglo-Saxon period, and preserve it for future generations.

Trust chairman Jim Chapman said: 'It is a hugely important building and its isolation is one of its joys.

'There was once a little community there. Traces of former buildings can be identified and there are headstones in the churchyard.

'But now it just looks idyllic, like a little snapshot of days gone by.'

Empty: The roof has been stripped off the church and all of the fittings removed since it fell out of use in the 19th century

In trouble: For decades the church, pictured her in 1985, has been propped up by wooden beams against its walls

Renovation: Ian Standing from the Forest of Dean Buildings Preservation Trust, which has bought the building for £1 and pledged to restore it

The church, believed to be one of the oldest buildings in Gloucestershire, is being examined by officials from English Heritage.

Restoration experts will be brought in to plan how the church can be saved for future generations.

The Trust has already secured funding from an environmental trust to enable builders to carry out a programme of stabilisation.

Mr Chapman said: 'It is an important and valuable asset - its roots are certainly pre-Norman and perhaps even earlier.

'We hope further investigation will reveal significantly more of its ancient past.'

Historical sources suggest that there was a church at Lancaut as early as the year 625, although the present building was constructed in the 12th century, not long after the coming of the Normans to England.

It is thought to have had some connection to nearby Tintern Abbey, a Cistercian foundation which was abandoned after the reformation and made famous by a William Wordsworth poem.

One theory suggests that it may once have been a leper colony, which would explain the presence nearby of medicinal herbs such as green hellebore.

Vow: The trust bought the building from the Crown Estate on the condition that it preserve the church for future generations

Eerie: The abandoned church occupies an evocative and romantic setting

St James's Church is far from the first property to go on the market for just £1 - but most of ultra-cheap homes do not have such a storied past.

A number of local councils have started selling off rundown houses for £1, in order to regenerate deprived areas by ensuring that enthusiastic new homeowners move in and renovate their properties.

Last year, 35 derelict homes in Stoke-on-Trent were sold off for a nominal sum to buyers who pledged to do up the houses.

A similar scheme in Liverpool allowed a taxi driver to move his family into a spacious new home after handing over £1 and promising to spend around £35,000 on refurbishing the place.

A boarded-up house in a Welsh mining village was even cheaper, going on the market with a reserve price of nil - meaning the new owner could move in for free if he was willing to put a lot of work into it.

The village of Lancaut had 10 houses in 1306, but in 1750 there were only two inhabited properties.

By the 19th century the church 
congregation was so small that services were only held in the summer 
months. It was finally abandoned in 1865.

The
 roof and the interior fittings, together with the font, were removed, 
while the elements chipped away at the building making it appear 
increasingly desolate.

The lead font can be dated to between 1120 and 1140 and is now in the Lady Chapel at Gloucester Cathedral.

Work on restoring the building is expected to start this summer.

The hamlet now forms part of a nature reserve, with both the river 
and the nearby woodland providing an important habitat for wildlife.

Among
 the animals found the Wye near Lancaut are porpoises, otters and 
herons, while the forest is home to a number of rare plants, with the 
absence of people allowing the area to become a natural haven.
