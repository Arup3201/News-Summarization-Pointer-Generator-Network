Jailed: Joshua Charnley, 19, drove with the shop assistant on his bonnet for half a mile - for £37

A teenager who stole £37 from a petrol station then sped off with the manager clinging to his bonnet for half a mile has been jailed for 11 years.

Joshua Charnley, 19, swerved across the road and tried to punch the shop worker's hands away, leaving 59-year-old victim Lekshmanan Asokkumar with a fractured skull and liver damage.

Mr Asokummar's wife Judie, 61, said the attack had destroyed their lives - and her husband was no longer the man she married.

His black Hyundai's numberplates covered with tape, part-time painter and decorator Charnley used his car 'like a weapon' as he fled the Texaco garage in West Kingsdown, Kent, a court heard.

Mr Asokummar, was working in the shop in July last year when he saw Charnley preparing to leave without paying.

Martin Jarvis, prosecuting, said: 'Mr Asokummar stood in front of the car and put his hands up.

'Charnley revved the engine and lurched the car forward on more than one occasion in an attempt to intimidate Mr Asokkumar.'

Charnley began shouting at Mr Asokkumar, but the manager stood his ground.

'Charnley then drove off quickly, revving hard and spinning the wheels directly at Mr Asokkumar,' he added.

'He then drove his car into Mr Asokkumar, scooping him up onto the bonnet and travelling nearly half a mile with the retail manager clinging on.

Terrifying: CCTV images captured the moment Charnley left the garage with the manager clinging to the bonnet

'The car hit him, lifting onto the bonnet and Charnley then continued down the road at 30mph with Mr Asokkumar clinging to the car.

'As the car continued up the road, one eye witness described Charnley punching Mr Asokkumar’s hands through the open window, while the car swerved from side to side.'

The shop worker was then flung to the ground when the car rounded a corner. Some of his injuries are likely to be permanent.

Charnley claimed he had ‘panicked’ and had no intention of hurting the shop worker.

But a jury found him guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent after nine hours of deliberation.

Shock: Police and forensics officers attended the scene and closed the road while they investigated

Charnley, from Hartley, Kent, had already admitted causing serious injury by driving dangerously.

He was also handed a 15-year driving ban.

Judge Nigel Van Der Bijl told him ‘results can be catastrophic’ when cars are used as weapons.

Speaking after the sentence was handed down, the victim's wife said he was in a critical condition for two days.

'Things got progressively worse so they had to do a major operation to save his life,' she said. 'For the first four or five weeks we didn’t know if he was going to survive or not.

'It just didn’t seem possible that someone could do that and travel so far before he threw him off the bonnet.

'He can’t work at the moment and may never be able to work again. We just don’t know what he’ll be capable of - it’s completely destroyed our lives.

Investigation: Forensics officers at the corner where the shop worker was believed to have hit the road

The crime happened in West Kingsdown, a village near the North Downs in Kent near affluent Sevenoaks

'At the moment, he’s very suppressed, very quiet, his whole character has changed - he’s just not the man I married.'

She added: '[Charnley] will serve his sentence and then continue the rest of his normal life whereas we’re left to pick up the pieces.

'In two minutes, everything changed. He should never have driven up the road with him on the bonnet - he obviously just didn’t care.

'I’d like to know why he did it. Why do that to somebody else for no reason?

'He was at fault by stealing the petrol, why make it worse by doing that to my husband?'
