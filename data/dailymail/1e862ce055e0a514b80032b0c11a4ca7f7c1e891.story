Werner Franz, the last surviving crew member of the Hindenburg disaster, has died aged 92

It was a life that could quite literally have gone up in flames - Werner Franz was just a 14-year-old cabin boy when he was aboard the German airship Hindenburg, as it became engulfed by fire and crashed in New Jersey 77 years ago.

His sharp young mind and a huge stroke of luck meant he spent those last 77 years alive, and not as a mere statistic in the tragedy which marked the end of the airship era.

As the huge, hydrogen-filled Zeppelin burst into flames, Mr Franz happened to be cleaning up in the officers' mess, where a huge tank of water above him burst and protected him from the blaze.

He was able to jump out of the ship as it fell devastatingly to the ground, and fled the wreckage to escape without so much as a scratch.

He had the nous to run into the wind - if he had gone the other way he would have been swallowed up by the flames and become the 37th life claimed by the tragedy.

Mr Franz certainly made the most of his lucky escape - he was 92 when he died from heart failure earlier this month - and was the last surviving crew member.

He returned to Germany after the crash, and served as an aircraft technician during World War II.

He went on to coach roller skating and ice skating later in life, and was never afraid to tell people about his experience, said Carl Jablonski, president of the Navy Lakehurst Historical Society, who last met him at a 2004 event commemorating the disaster.

The tragedy is particularly iconic in the history of aircraft, as photographers and film crews were able to capture the devastation as it unfolded.

Today, photographs not only show us the enormity of the event, but also how fortunate Mr Franz and the airship's 61 other on-board survivors really were.

The crash, which spelled the end of the airship era, killed 36 people including 22 members of the crew

The disaster is considered one of the most iconic air crashes in history due to the extensive media coverage

John Provan, a long -time friend, told of how the young Franz came to be on Hindenburg completely by chance.

'His older brother worked at a fancy hotel in Frankfurt where the passengers and the captain stayed overnight before the airship took off early in the morning,' he said. 'One of the captains said they were looking for a cabin boy and [his brother] heard about it.' 

He added: 'Werner was most fortunate because he was in the officers' mess cleaning up. Above him was a large tank of water that burst open and drenched him, which protected him a bit from the flames and the heat.'

He was able to jump out of a cloth supply hatch onto the ground below and made the wise decision to run into the wind.

'He didn't make the mistake of going in the other direction or the flames would have caught him,' Mr Provan said.

Mr Provan, quoting Mr Franz's widow Annerose, confirmed that he died in his home town of Frankfurt on August 13.

There are believed to be three more survivors from the disaster still alive today - two passengers named Werner Doehner and Horst Schirmer, who were both children - and Robert Buchanan, a member of the ground crew that was waiting to moor the ship.

The Hindenburg disaster happened on Thursday, May 6, 1937, when the German passenger airship LZ 129 Hindenburg caught fire and crashed at Lakehurst Naval Air Station in New Jersey as it tried to dock with its mooring mast.

There were 97 people on board the ship, made up of 36 passengers and 61 members of crew. Of those, 35 died - 13 passengers and 22 crew - along with one worker on the ground. In total, 36 people were killed, though it could have been more, as the flight was only half booked.

The huge airship - as long as three football fields and 15 stories tall - was considered the most luxurious means to cross the Atlantic at the time. Its loss - widely attributed to static electricity that ignited leaking hydrogen - was a heavy blow to the image of a resurgent Germany that the Nazis wanted to project to the world. 

The disaster was hugely covered in the media, as photographers and video artists were able to capture it from the ground - this helped make it one of the most iconic and highest profile aircraft crashes in history.

The airship had left from Frankfurt three days earlier on May 3, for what was supposed to the the first of 10 trips between Europe and America. As it came to land it was hours behind schedule because of stormy weather. The captain diverted it towards Manhattan Island, which drew huge crowds of people who came to catch a glimpse of the vast ship.

The craft came in to land at around 7.30pm, and witnesses recounted seeing what looked like a gas leak, and also what may have been static electricity.

It is disputed where the fire started, but those on board heard an explosion, before the ship burst into flames.

The back of the ship broke and the tail end crashed into the ground. This caused fire to fly through the nose and kill nine members of the crew.

In total, the accident is believed to have lasted between just 32 and 37 second, with experts analysing that the fire spread at a rate of around 15m/s.

There are other theories relating to how the fire came to start. These range from the idea that a gunshot was actually to blame, that it was struck by lightning or that the engine failed, though the static theory is considered to be the most likely.
