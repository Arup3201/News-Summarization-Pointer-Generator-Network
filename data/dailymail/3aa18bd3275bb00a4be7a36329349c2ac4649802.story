Lukas Podolski has admitted he does not know who Hull City’s Matty Fryatt is, despite the striker scoring in the FA Cup semi-final against Sheffield United.

The German will be a key cog for Arsenal as they attempt to end a nine-year trophy drought against the Tigers in the final at Wembley on Saturday.

But if Fryatt approaches Podolski to swap shirts afterwards he might not have much luck.

Excuse me? Arsenal's Lukas Podolski has admitted that he has no idea who Hull City striker Matty Fryatt is

We'll see who's laughing! Fryatt was integral for the Tigers during their semi-final win against Sheffield United 

Asked about Fryatt, Podolski said: ‘Who? Who is this? Our focus is on our game. We are strong enough. We play nearly at home (at Wembley) and I focus on our game. I don’t look at the names or how Hull is playing.

‘I go out and this is the final game, this is 90 minutes of fighting and running and at the end we will see who the winner.

‘I think when we play like the last weeks – how we’ve played at home and away – we’ll win this cup.’
