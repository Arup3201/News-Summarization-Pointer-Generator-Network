They are the serious-minded protesters who have taken to the streets in outrage at the killings of black men Eric Garner and Michael Brown by the police.

But many of the young demonstrators incensed by the perceived injustices are struggling to stay off their cell phones long enough to get their point across.

At cities across the country, almost every frame of a 'die-in' protest features at least one participant bathed in the white light of their cell phones, rather than playing dead.

In some, a majority of participants at events in highly public places such as New York City's Grand Central Terminal, the White House or busy city intersections, are glued to their touchscreens.

The die-ins are designed to raise awareness and express outrage at the cases of Michael Brown, who was shot dead in Ferguson, Missouri, by officer Darren Wilson in August.

In November a grand jury declined to indict the officer, a decision which prompted a tide of outrage from civil rights activists, who made calls for legal reform.

Eric Garner, a man killed on Staten Island, New York, by the NYPD, who put him in a choke-hold this summer, has also been incorporated in many of the protests.

A grand jury decided Wednesday that no charges would be brought in relation to his death as well.

The object of a die-in is to imitate a dead body, usually to raise awareness of people who have been killed.

The tactic has increased in prominence in recent years, being used for everything from lobbying for increased road safety to issues of alleged police brutality.

She said: 'A die-in is definitely all about optics and visuals - we're going to be out here for four and a half hours, to represent the four-and-a-half hours Mike Brown's body lay in the street.'

Images of the die-ins from all over the country have been shared. Events in Texas, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., New York City and Atlanta have all featured on major news outlets.

Some lasted only a few minutes, while others continued for hours. 

Many campuses have featured, including one in Missouri where organizers asked white people to stand at the back and hold hands instead of laying down, according to The College Fix.
