Blackpool winger Tom Ince is close to becoming Hull's third signing of the summer after turning down a move to Inter Milan.

Ince is meeting Tigers officials for the first time on Tuesday with a view to completing his switch to the Barclays Premier League.

The 22-year-old England Under-21 winger met Inter chiefs in Italy last month to discuss a possible move but decided his future was in England.

On the move: Tom Ince is set to sing for Hull City

International honours: Ince represented the England U21s earlier this summer

Despite 
Ince being out of contract at Bloomfield Road, he is under 23 so 
Blackpool will be due compensation when he makes his next move.

Hull
 boss Steve Bruce completed the permanent signing of Tottenham 
midfielder Jake Livermore last month and has also landed Robert 
Snodgrass from Norwich for a reported £7million fee.
