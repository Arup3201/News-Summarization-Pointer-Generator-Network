Living
in squalor and sentenced to a life of shame and hard labour, these are 
the women who have been forced to live as outcasts amid accusations that
they are witches.

Cut off from their communities and 
abandoned by their families, they are banished to spend the rest of 
their days in 'witch camps'.

Hundreds of women in northern Ghana 
are accused of witchcraft and condemned to a life of extreme violence, 
harassment and isolation.

Many of the women in the camps
have been accused of being witches by relatives or neighbours. Once an 
accusation is made they are banished from their villages and sometimes 
chased out by a violent mob.

Often young female relatives are sent with them 
to live in the camp as an ‘attendant’ and also live in the same 
appalling conditions, facing terrible discrimination.

In some cases, the fate of the women 
is determined not by the elders of their village, but by the dying 
contortions of a slaughtered chicken.

If 
the chicken falls with its head down and its feet in the air, the woman 
is declared a witch. If it falls feet down, her innocence is declared.

However, regardless of the outcome, 
once an accusation has been made a woman will be sent to the camp 
whether she's 'guilty' or not, just in case some villagers do not 
believe her innocence.

A report compiled by international
aid charity ActionAid documents cases of both elderly and young women 
abandoned by their families and trapped in the ‘witch camps’ until they 
die.

The report, titled ‘Condemned without 
trial: women and witchcraft in Ghana’, describes six ‘witch’ camps’ in 
Northern Ghana, Gambaga, Kukuo, Gnani, Bonyase, Nabuli and Kpatinga.

Some camps came in to existence as 
long as 100 years ago and mostly consist of mud huts. Women in the camps
have to walk many miles to collect water, food is in short supply 
health and education services are very limited.

ActionAid says the camps are 
effectively women’s prisons where the inmates have been given no trial, 
have no right of appeal, but have received a life sentence.

The report highlights the violence 
suffered by women accused of witchcraft.

'These women are at the mercy of their 
accusers who destroy their lives and condemn them to a life of 
imprisonment'

A mother of three was murdered 
after being blamed for the death of a child through witchcraft. She was 
beaten unconscious before being set on fire.

Asana, 27, describes how she came to 
live in one of the camps. She was accused of being a witch by her 
ex-husband, who beat and poured melted plastic over her while she was 
pregnant.

Her new husband and family were unable
to protect her and took her to a camp so she could hide there. She has 
not been able to leave.

Sano Kojo, 66, has lived in a camp for more than 30 years after she was accused of killing her cousin.

She said: 'People don’t care about the alleged witches. Once you are here you are forgotten.'

Adwoa Kwateng-Kluvitse, ActionAid
Ghana Country Director, said: 'Women accused of being witches find 
their lives have been snatched away from them. The violence and 
brutality many face is shocking. These women are at the mercy of their 
accusers who destroy their lives and condemn them to a life of 
imprisonment.'

Pounding dawa dawa: Meal preparation is time consuming, and food-related tasks occupy much of the day

Almost every woman accused of being a witch is poor and powerless. An ActionAid survey of the camps found more than 70 per cent of women were accused of being witches after their husbands died.

The survey also found one in three women in the camp was not earning money before they were accused of being a witch and were seen as an economic burden by their community.

However, the camps do provide sanctuary for women accused of being witches, as many in their communities believe the women cannot practice witchcraft once they are in a camp.

ActionAid calls on the government of Ghana to ensure the basic human rights of women in the camps are upheld with access to health and education services.

Action Aid also believes the international community and UK government must do all they can to address issues relating to the ‘witch’ camps’ and engage with the Ghanaian government to ensure women’s human rights are protected.
