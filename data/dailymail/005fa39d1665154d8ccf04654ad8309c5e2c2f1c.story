Colin Montgomerie is tipping bookies’ favourite Rory McIlroy to take advantage of Tiger Woods’ absence and win the US Open.

The world No 6 celebrated his first-ever major triumph back in 2011 when he won the US Open at Congressional and his form of late, despite his high-profile break-up with tennis ace Caroline Wozniacki, has improved considerably.

The 25-year-old showed his strength and class to win the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth last month and he shot six-under par to finish tied-15th at the recent Memorial Championship.VIDEO Scroll down for Rory McIlroy practising his swing ahead of the US Open

Chillaxed: Colin Montgomerie believes that McIlroy can storm the US open in the absence of Tiger Woods

McIlroy will begin his quest for glory on Thursday and Friday alongside two fellow former US Open champions in Webb Simpson and good friend Graeme McDowell, completing a field buoyed by the absence of former world No 1 Woods who remains sidelined with a back problem.

And Montgomerie believes the Northern Ireland native will be in contention for a third major success come Sunday’s final round.

‘Pinehurst is a ball strikers course and he [McIlroy] being the best ball striker in the world has to start as favourite.

‘Without Tiger [Woods] there, Rory McIlory is the favourite and you’d expect him to be right there.

'Who can say he’s going to win because golf is one of these things. But Rory will be in contention. Definitely.’

McIlory has admitted he will be making some equipment changes to his bag this week, opting to put a three-iron in and go with a three-wedge system comprising of a pitch wedge, 54 and 59 degree clubs.

And Montgomerie, who was McIlroy’s Ryder Cup-winning captain at Celtic Manor four years ago, has warned Pinehurst will be a difficult beast to tame.

‘The US Open is seen as the toughest to win.’ he said, speaking exclusively to Sportsmail at Gleneagles, venue for this year’s Ryder Cup extravaganza, where he launched the Johnnie Walker Blue Label limited edition whiskey on Monday.

‘Pinehurst is very different this year. They’ve cut back all of the rough - in fact, there’s no rough at all really.

‘Ben Crenshaw and his team have been asked by the USGA to put Pinehurst back to its original state.

‘So, on all of the greens, you may run off and there’s no rough to stop it. Instead of stopping short in the rough to give you a flop shot, the ball will now run 30 yards extra down a slope.

‘What is means is, you’ve got all sorts of options. Do you chip it? Do you putt it? It’s very difficult. If it’s at all breezy it could be near impossible.

‘This is a real, real challenge and the greens are firm too. A true test.’

Justin Rose ended the 43-year hoodoo of an English champion when he became the first since Tony Jacklin in 1970 to win the US Open at Merion last year.

Montgomerie, 50, reckons Rose has every chance of defending his title in North Carolina and claims it’s all thanks to the benchmark set by Padraig Harrington.

Harrington won back-to-back Open championships in 2007 and 2008 before landing the PGA Championship in the same calendar year.

And Montgomerie said: ‘Justin’s chances of retaining are very high.

‘I think that Padraig Harrington gave those types of players belief that, “Look, I can do this lads, I’ve won three out of four majors... and so can you”.

‘I think it’s helped Rory, it helped Graeme McDowell and helped Justin Rose in winning these major championships since. They all have a great opportunity again.

'Rory, I think, is one of the favourites. But Justin Rose is returning to form following his shoulder injury.

‘Going back to a championship that you’ve won, albeit at a different venue, as a defending champion you feel you’ve got a chance to do it again. And, obviously, Justin is up there with the favourites to win.’

Montgomerie, who will be summarising the play for Sky Sports in North Carolina this week, is refusing to rule out the heavyweight American stars though.

‘Who could discount Bubba Watson?’ he added.

‘You never know what’s going to happen. He could just blast it round there and get away with it.

‘And then there’s Phil Mickelson. We’d all love for him to finally win the US Open. Six times runner-up in the one event he’s not won.

‘This time he’s playing a course that could suit him, especially with the short game wizardry that he has.

‘There’s a number of guys potentially who could win it really.’

So, what about the chances of a Scottish success in the States on Sunday?

‘Well, I like the look of Stephen Gallacher right now,’ he said.

‘It would be great if he gets in the Ryder Cup team at Glenagles for Scotland’s sake. He’s hitting the ball extremely well.’

Perhaps Gallacher will take inspiration from Montgomerie in his pursuit of a first ever major.

Montgomerie, after all, was the last Scot to return home victorious from across the Atlantic after his stunning Senior PGA Championship victory at Harbor Shores last month.

‘It was wonderful,’ said Montgomerie. If you lead going into the last round and shoot a 65 you’d be unlucky not to lose really.

‘But at the same time, it was great to win in America. It has been a long time coming and I’m thrilled.

‘I guess it was a relief more than anything. 22 years I’ve been playing in America, playing in a 130-odd tournaments, so it was nice to finally win a stroke play event!’
