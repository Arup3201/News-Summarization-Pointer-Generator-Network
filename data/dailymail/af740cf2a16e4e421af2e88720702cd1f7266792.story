Immaculately turned out in a navy blue suit alongside his wife Zara and her grandmother the Queen, rugby player Mike Tindall was the picture of refinement on a day out at Ascot with his regal relations.

Apart from the array of bloodied scratches clearly visible on his face that is.

The injuries betrayed the altogether more boisterous nature of Tindall's life outside of society circles, after he apparently took a rugby boot to the face during a match on Thursday.

The former England captain was in action for Gloucester at the Kingsholm Stadium on Thursday when his club met Bordeaux in an Amlin Challenge Cup match.

Tindall trooped off the pitch 52 minutes into the game after picking up an injury.

The scrapes on the rugby players cheek - which looked as though they were the result of another player's studs being dragged across Tindall's face during a rough tackle on the field - were still clearly evident on Saturday as he and wife Zara watched unbeaten racehorse Frankel romp to a 14th victory at Ascot.

Zara looked elegant in a smart plum jacket with a matching hat, while her husband was dapper in a navy blue suit and purple tie.

Several other royals were also in attendance to witness Frankel's swansong on Saturday, including racing enthusiast Queen Elizabeth.

Lauded as the world's greatest racehorse, Frankel stormed to victory in the Â£1.3million Qipco Champion Stakes at Ascot.

The four-year-old thoroughbred was roared on by a 32,000 strong crowd, and no-one gave the colt's victory a more rapturous reception than the Queen, who raised her fists in the air in delight as it crossed the finish line.
