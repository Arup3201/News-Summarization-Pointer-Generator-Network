A £1 billion order for super-fast bullet trains in the UK will be made in Japan in what critics will call a missed opportunity for British industry.

The Government is set to announce the deal which will see the First Great Western rail firm bring 500 carriages into service here by 2016.

Despite the huge size of the deal, it is expected to only create 500 British jobs with the majority of construction to be done by company Hitachi in Japan.

Critics, including the rail union RMT, will argue that a British company should have insisted the entire fleet be built here to create more UK jobs.

The Government will argue that this is the best deal for taxpayers as Hitachi offered the best price and most competitive tender.

Sources at the Department for Transport confirmed the order was ‘in the very final stages of negotiation’ and an announcement was expected before the start of the Olympics.

Called the Intercity Express Project, the bullet trains will provide extra seating to ease overcrowding, will be faster and are electric and so are more environmentally friendly.

Hitachi will build the shells of the trains at its factory in Kasado, near Hiroshima in Japan before they are shipped to the UK where they will be assembled before going into service.

Hitachi says the trains shells must 
be built in Japan because they use unique technology which would be too 
expensive to transfer here for the order. 

But should the company win more orders it might be possible to build entire trains in the UK.

Hitachi General Manager Kentaro Masai said: ‘It will be an honour to build these trains. 

‘They will have Japanese technology that will make them safe and reliable.

‘We will also use our technology to give passengers a smooth ride. 

‘At Hitachi we deliver what we say and these trains will be a good addition to the UK network.’

Once brought to the UK, the trains will be assembled in a new plant in north east England, creating an estimated 500 jobs. 

New maintenance depots will also operate in London, Bristol and Wales. 

The carriages, which will be similar to the new high speed Javelin trains in Kent, will replace 125 trains which were introduced in the 1970s by British Rail as the new ‘age of the train’ made famous by a TV advert fronted by Jimmy Saville. 

They will run from Paddington to Bristol and Cardiff, stopping at Reading, Swindon, Newbury, Didcot and Banbury stations.

Aluminium lengths 26 metres long will be welded together to make the trains safer in a crash, Hitachi said.

They will also have the latest state-of-the-art electrics but interiors are to be decided by the train operator.

Bullet trains have become world famous for their aerodynamic long nosed which allows them to travel as fast as 225 mph.
