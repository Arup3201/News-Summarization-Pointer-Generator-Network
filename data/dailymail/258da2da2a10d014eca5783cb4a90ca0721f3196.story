A sat-nav blunder left a 44-tonne truck stuck on a bus tramway after the driver faithfully followed the machine's instructions, despite the warning signage.

The £100millon track built to take buses into Cambridge speedily confused the lorry driver who was unfamiliar with the area. 

But a local council spokesman insisted he was 'quite puzzled how the driver managed it.'

Warning signs: A lorry driver carried on through all signage to end up on a
concrete track which whisks buses into Cambridge

Reprimanded: The driver had been relying too heavily on his sat-nav

Dog walker Doug Parker, of Longstanton, 
Cambridgeshire was waiting to catch the guided Busway into Cambridge 
with his wife Pauline when he snapped the pictures of the errant lorry.

Mr Parker said: 'We saw a red vehicle turn onto the busway, and thought it was a bus, but were amazed to see it was a big lorry'.

'It managed to turn off into the main car park I think, and get off that way.'

Peter Metcalfe, boss of haulage firm Metcalfe's which operates the bus from Hawes, North Yorkshire, said his driver had 'relied too heavily on his sat-nav' and had been reprimanded.

He apologised to the council, but said
the driver told him his navigation system did not give any warning 
about the concrete tracks.

He
said: 'We don't usually deliver around the Longstanton area, or 
Cambridgeshire, so it wasn't something the driver had ever come across 
before.'

Future fine: The council warned that if the mistake happened again the haulage company could face a penalty of up to £1,000

Unfamiliar territory: The lorry driver from Yorkshire got confused in Cambridge's unusual road system

'However, I do think some people rely too heavily on sat-navs instead of reading the road signs.'

Graham Hughes, director of strategy and development at the council, said: 'There are clear and prominent signs on all the entry points.'

'To be honest, we do struggle to understand how this driver, in broad daylight, managed to get on to the busway.'

The council warned Mr Metcalfe that the company could be fined up to £1,000 if it happened again.

However, the busway has had its fair share of criticism itself.

Cambridgeshire was awarded £92.5 million from Government to build The Busway.

However, more than 50 emergencies have been reported on the track in the six months running up to January – 20 of them caused by motorists driving on to the track.

An average of nine incidents has been logged on the guideway every month, according to Cambridge News.
