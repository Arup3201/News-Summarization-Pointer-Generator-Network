Most parents will do whatever they can to give their children the best start in life.

And it seems increasing numbers of families are looking for help from the gods, even when it comes to naming their newborns.

Nevaeh - or heaven spelt backwards - has become one of the fastest-growing popular names for babies.

Another unusual name, Miley, is also pushing up the rankings, thanks to the fame of American actress and pop singer Miley Cyrus.

But some celebrity names - 
such as Jordan, inspired by reality TV star Katie Price and U.S. 
basketball great Michael Jordan - are on the wane.

Britons can find out how popular their name is by visiting a website which analyses figures from the Office for National Statistics.

The website, England & Wales Baby Names, found that names have become more diverse, with the total number soaring from about 8,700 in 1996 to more than 13,400 in 2010.

  The names which have increased in popularity the most since 1996 are:

BOYS:

1. Oliver2. Ethan3. Charlie4. Lucas5. Noah6. Archie7. Oscar8. Riley9. Jayden10. Logan

GIRLS:

1.  Lily2.  Grace3.  Ava4.  Evie5.  Amelia6.  Ellie7.  Isabella8.  Olivia9.  Mia10. Maisie

The most popular names are Lily for girls and Oliver for boys, but the study of some 27,000 names found Nevaeh had risen to number 163 in the list.

There were no Nevaehs in 2000. More than 320 children had the name in 2010.

Trend-setter: The name Nevaeh - heaven spelt backwards - became popular after Christian rocker Sonny Sandoval chose it for his daughter

The trend can be linked to Sonny Sandoval, an American singer with Christian rock band POD, who gave the name Nevaeh to one of his daughters.

He mentioned it during an interview on MTV and the name became a hot topic on internet chat rooms.

In 2001, it was among the 1,000 most popular names for babies in the U.S.

Other unusual names which have grown in popularity, as well as Miley, include Macy, Olly and Kenzie.

As they have become more common, Jordan has been on a downward trend for boys and girls since 1996.

Researchers also found that hyphenated first names had trebled in popularity.

The website's creator, Anna Powell-Smith, 31, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, said: “Broadly, in recent years, girls’ names have become more flowery and old-fashioned, while Biblical boys’ names are out of favour.

“Parents consistently show more variety when naming their daughters than their sons.”

The website only includes names that were given to three or more babies.

A survey published this week found that more than two in five Britons confessed to having second thoughts after naming their child.

Of those who admitted regret, 19 per cent admitted to 'not liking’ their child’s name and a further two per cent owned up to aggressively disliking it.

Twenty-two per cent told the survey that their child’s name ‘grew’ on them.

The high figures are believed to be linked to celebrity names which go out of fashion when stars fade from the spotlight.
