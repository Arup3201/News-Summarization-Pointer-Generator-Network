Accused: Mundill Mahil is accused of luring her ex-boyfriend to her flat in Brighton where she was attacked. She denies murder

A medical student ordered two ‘gangster friends’ to kill a ‘besotted’ television executive in revenge after he tried to rape her, a court heard yesterday.

Mundill Mahil, 20, lured millionaire Gagandip Singh to her house, where he was beaten unconscious then bundled into the boot of a car and burned alive, the jury was told.

She allegedly told friends she wanted Mr Singh dead – and, the court heard, persuaded another man who was infatuated with her to murder him.

Mr Singh, 21, was killed in February, after the ‘intelligent and attractive young woman’ convinced him, through a series of  text messages, to come to her student digs in Brighton at 11pm, the jury was told.

But when he walked into her bedroom, carrying a teddy bear and flowers, he found Harvinder Shoker – who was also in love with Mahil – and ‘hired muscle’ Darren Peters waiting for him, the court heard.

During the beating Mr Singh – the owner of a new broadcasting service called Sikh TV – screamed Mahil’s name and begged for help, it was claimed.

The two men, both 20, wrapped the victim in Mahil’s duvet and bundled him into the boot of the Mercedes he arrived in, then drove to a quiet street in Blackheath, south-east London, doused the car in petrol and set it alight, the Old Bailey was told.

A post mortem examination revealed Mr Singh was still alive when the fire was started.

Prosecutor Aftab Jafferjee QC told the jury that the attack was carried out to ‘exact revenge and retribution’ on Mr Singh, whom Mahil knew ‘remained besotted by her’.

‘At the heart of this case there lies some unattractive and raw human emotions at work,’ he said.

Mahil, of Chatham in Kent, Shoker, of Greenwich, south-east London, and Peters, of Blackheath, all deny murder.

‘Gagandip Singh was plainly, on the evidence, besotted with her,’ Prosecutor
Aftab Jafferjee QC told jurors of the relationship that began in 2009.

Murdered: Gagandip Singh, 21, was in a car that was set on fire

He
wooed her with gifts, while she provided him with emotional support - 
particularly when his father was murdered on a visit to India in 
September 2009 - and would spend hours chatting with him on the phone 
and internet, the court heard.

Gagandip's father's 
packaging business had been turning over more than £2million year when money started going missing from the firm.

His accountant was based in India and the father went to investigate but was murdered there. His son took over the firm and also started the Sikh TV channel on Sky.

However Gagandip's relationship with his
girlfriend Mahil broke down in August 2010 after Mr Singh 'attempted to
rape' her in her student house.

A housemate, Becky Edwards, 
described Mahil as an 'agony aunt' and said: 'During our first year she 
talked to him about very intimate, personal things.

'He was a millionaire who offered her 
lots of gifts which she refused. After his father died they became 
closer and he was dependent on her.'

But Mr Jafferjee said the attempted rape changed everything.

He said: ‘It is common ground that he tried to have sex with her by getting into her bed.

‘Both were to describe it as an attempted rape - although in fact her description of events, even to her friends, suggest it did not get as far as that.

‘It is common ground that he tried to have sex with her by getting into her bed.'

‘She forced him away, he broke down in tears and he left.’

Mahil became increasingly upset and angry, and spurned Mr Singh’s attempts to strike up further contact with her, jurors were told.

She became so resentful that after the attempted rape she referred to him only as s***face,' the court heard.

'That she disliked him intensely there can be little doubt,' the barrister said.

'She can be extremely manipulative. 
She knew that he was completely besotted by her and would jump at the 
chance of contact with her.'

At the same time, she also began a relationship with Shoker, who Mr Jafferjee told jurors was also ‘besotted’ with her.

‘She told her housemates about how on 
occasions certain of her male friends, which she referred to as gangster
friends, wished to exact revenge and retribution on him (Mr Singh) but 
that she would discourage it,’ he added.

‘Unfortunately
by February this year, far from discouraging anyone from harming him, 
she lured him to Brighton, suggesting a meeting at the same house at 
11pm.’ The victim was both ‘excited’ and ‘wary’, he said, adding: ‘He 
asked her whether she was sure this was such a good idea.’

Mr Jafferjee added: ‘On February 25 he drove down in his sister’s Mercedes.

‘But laying in wait for him in the basement of the house, where her bedroom was, were Ravi and Darren Peters.

‘He had no idea what lay in store for him. He was attacked and beaten unconscious.

‘He
was then wrapped up in Mahil’s duvet and carried by Ravi and Peters and
dumped in the boot of the Mercedes he had arrived in.’

After the car had been driven to Blackheath it was set on fire with Mr Singh still in the boot.

‘Petrol was poured on to the car, including onto him as he lay either still unconscious or on any view completely helpless inside the boot,’ said Mr Jafferjee.

‘It is scientifically clear beyond any doubt that he was still alive at that point.

‘The car was then set alight with him in the boot and that is how his life was ended.’

The prosecutor added that Mahil was key to the killing and initiated it.

'Her
role was central. If she had agreed to lure him to Brighton that 
fateful evening the deceased would have been safe and alive today,' Mr 
Jafferjee said.

'No-one else had the ability to get the deceased to a place where he was completely vulnerable.'

‘It is scientifically clear beyond any doubt that he was still alive at that point. The car was then set alight with him in the boot and that is how his life was ended.’

Her new boyfriend, Shoker, 'almost certainly had his own agenda and it was not of the righteous crusader protecting a young woman's virtue,' the barrister added.

'He being besotted with her was more than happy to get rid of Gagandip.'

Peters was hired to help deal with the victim who was one grade below black belt at Taekwondo, the court heard.

'Mahil was the person who lured the victim into the trap that had been laid,' Mr Jafferjee said.

'Peters and Ravi were the hired muscle who would draw this plan to its awful conclusion.'

Housemate Live Thorsen said on the night of the killing she saw sobbing Mahil coming up from the basement.

'She was shaking with tears in her eyes. She was very traumatised. She said "He's been here." She said she had a flashback (to the attempted rape) on seeing his face.

'I could hear noise coming from down the stairs. It was very loud like someone was trying to tear the house down. It was a loud fight.'

Mahil told her she had asked Mr Singh to come to the house and he had turned up with a teddy bear for her.

'She said that she was told to get him into the house and get him downstairs and then open the door to her room and then run upstairs.

'She described how once she had opened the door they had leapt straight on him and she remained on the stairs unable to move.

'The deceased had been screaming her name asking for help, but she couldn't bring herself to help.'

Later Mahil told her the two men were taking the victim to the car, the court heard.

The trial continues.
