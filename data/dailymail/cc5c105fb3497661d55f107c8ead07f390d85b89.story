The Navy SEAL who recounted his experiences fighting the Taliban in the book Lone Survivor took to Facebook to taunt the man convicted of the murder of American Sniper Chris Kyle and Chad Littlefield.

Marcus Luttrell wrote; 'Justice served for Chris and the Littlefield family. To Eddie Ray Routh, you thought you had PTSD before .?? Wait till the boys in TDC Find out you killed a TX hero.'

Luttrell taunted Routh about heading to the 'TDC' - Texas Department of Corrections - just one day after a jury found him guilty on two counts of  murder.

Luttrell later told Fox News  about the post, 'It’s not secret that usually I don’t have a filter.'

He then added; 'What comes through my head is going to come out of my mouth. … I don’t know that he’s going to read that, but I’m sure someone will get it to him what’s about to go down when he gets where he’s going.'

Earlier in the day, the widow of Kyle posted a touching tribute to her slain husband as she praised the jury for finding his killer guilty.

'God Bless the Jury And good people of Stephenville, Texas!!' Taya Kyle wrote on Facebook on Wednesday morning, just hours after the jury found Eddie Ray Routh guilty of murder.

'Chris, you are the love of my life. You live on in my heart. You always will. I hope we all live lives that make you proud. And babe, Rest assured you don't need a fancy resting place - you live on... Safe In the hearts you left behind.'

Taya had not been in the court for the guilty verdict on Tuesday evening; she had stormed out of the courtroom and slammed the door as the defense gave their closing arguments, according to Fox.

Tribute: She also shared this image to Facebook, writing: 'What a poetic morning when the snow is melting and the winter is thawing out promising a new day' before praising the jury in Stephenville, Texas

The Facebook post is the first time she has spoken publicly about the jury's decision. 

Routh, 27, was emotionless as the jury read their verdict on Tuesday night: that he had not been insane when he opened fire on Chris Kyle and Chad Littlefield in February 2013. They had taken him to a shooting range to help him settle back into society after he left the Marines.

After the verdict, Littlefield's brother-in-law, Jerry Richardson, turned to Routh and said: 'You took the lives of two heroes, men that tried to be a friend to you. You became an American disgrace.'

As the Littlefield family also spoke out on the Today show on Wednesday morning, jurors stepped forward to say they had 'no doubt' that Routh knew what he was doing at the time of the murders.

The verdict came as interest in Kyle's career as the U.S. military's deadliest-ever sniper reached fever pitch thanks to Oscar-nominated film about his life, 'American Sniper'.

Guilty: Eddie Ray Routh, 27, was convicted of capital murder by a jury in Texas after just two hours of deliberations on Tuesday evening and has been sentenced to life in prison without parole

Ahead of the trial, Routh's lawyers had argued that the popularity of the movie, which grossed $300 million at the box office, would mean he could not get a fair trial.

And speaking on Good Morning America on Wednesday, the jurors admitted some of them had seen the movie - but insisted they had put that out of their minds when making their decision.

'It gave me a better outlook on Chris' role as a Marine,' one of the jurors, Barrett Hutchinson, said. 'But as far as the actions that took place on February 2, Chad was still in the picture and Chad was not in that movie.

'I took the fact that Chris was a marine out of my mind and looked at him as a person, looked at Chad as a person, looked at Eddie as a person and, you know, tried to make reasonable judgment.' 

Also on Wednesday, Chad Littlefield's family spoke out about the verdict.

'It was an answered prayer,' Judy Littlefield told the Today show. 'We've waited a long time to hear that. We feel justice has been served.'

Relief: The parents of victim Chad Littlefield, Judy and Don Littlefield, pictured right, and his brother-in-law Jerry Richardson, left, said the guilty verdict for his killer 'was an answered prayer'

Beloved: Chad Littlefield, pictured above left and right, was not a veteran but was committed to helping them when they returned from overseas, his parents said. He was shot dead by Routh in February 2013

Routh's brother-in-law added that he never once believed Routh had been insane. Routh's attorneys had tried to prove he was in a psychotic state at the time of the killings.

'It was all an act,' Jerry Richardson said. 'I taught him in high school and... that's just the way he was. He never grew up. He was still just opposite defiant, and he had nothing wrong in the mind except for the drug use.'

Chad's father Don remembered his son as a 'quiet man' and 'a good listener' who met Kyle at their children's soccer practices.

The two men shared an interest in working out and helping veterans, Don said. Chad himself was not a veteran but wanted to help others.

'Chris served overseas and Chad served when they came back,' Mrs Littlefield explained.

Mr Littlefield added: 'His motto was pass it forward.'  

Kyle's widow, Taya Kyle, testified in the trial but has not spoken out since the verdict. She was seen in the courtroom on Tuesday but did not return when the decision was read. 

Fair trial? Jury members also spoke out on Wednesday and said they had 'no doubt' Routh was guilty - but they also admitted that some of them had seen the 'American Sniper' movie ahead of the trial

Chris Kyle's brother and parents were seen hugging and crying inside the courtroom after the verdict, but they did not issue a statement. 

As prosecutors decided not to pursue the death penalty, the only possible sentence for Routh was life in prison - with no chance of parole. 

Kyle and Littlefield had taken Routh to the shooting range at Rough Creek Lodge and Resort on February 2, 2013, after Routh's mother asked Kyle to help her troubled son.

Family members say Routh suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder from serving in Iraq and in Haiti after the devastating 2010 earthquake.

Defense attorneys noted that Kyle had described Routh as 'straight-up nuts' in a text message to Littlefield as they drove to the luxury resort and asked Littlefield to watch his back. 

While at the shooting range, Routh first opened fire on Littlefield, then turned on Kyle, whom he shot six times.

He later said he was 'riled up' because Littlefield wasn't joining in with the shooting, then murdered Kyle too because he knew he would kill him. Psychiatrists for the defense also claimed Routh believed the men were human-pig hybrids who were going to assassinate him.

After shooting the men dead, he fled in Kyle's pickup truck, drove to see family members and even stopped at Taco Bell. He was eventually arrested after a police chase and later confessed to the crime on video, which was played to the jury. 

Among evidence entered by prosecutors was a recorded phone call between Routh and a reporter  in which Routh said he was annoyed Littlefield wasn't shooting.

'Are you gonna shoot? Are you gonna shoot? It's a shooting sport. You shoot,' Routh said in the phone call. 'That's what got me all riled up.' 

Routh's friends and family testified that his behavior in the weeks before the shootings was increasingly erratic and that 'he did not seem all there' after gunning down the two men.

Routh, who served with the Marines in Iraq and Haiti, had been admitted to Veterans Affairs hospitals on multiple occasions after his service to treat mental illness. 

They said he was unable to care for himself, acted as if he believed that someone was going to hurt him and thought that the government was listening to him.  

Caught: Routh is pictured in the back of a police car after he fled the scene of the murder in Kyle's truck before he was eventually caught. He claimed he shot the two men because he feared they would kill him

This pistol, found in Kyle's truck, which Routh fled in, matched bullet fragments found in Littlefield's body

Confession: Routh, pictured hours after the killings, confessed to the shootings almost immediately

'It was clear that he was psychotic,' Mitchell H. Dunn, a forensic psychiatrist for the defense, told the court on Thursday. 'There was no question about that.' 

But the jury rejected the claim after prosecutors contended Routh knew what he was doing and acted deliberately when he shot the two and then fled.

They said any bizarre behavior was the result of Routh's reliance on marijuana. He had smoked the drug with his uncle the morning before the shootings.

A prosecution expert, Dr. Michael Arambula, said Routh's actions do not meet the legal definition of insanity under state criminal law.

'Any time intoxication is present, the game is over,' Arambula testified.
