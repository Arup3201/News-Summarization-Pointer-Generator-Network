Mourinho has great determination, is good looking, can speak five languages AND wins everything... it's not fair! 

Jose Mourinho has paid tribute to legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson, admitting he always selected the best bottle of wine when Manchester United came to play Chelsea.

The Blues boss was speaking to Clare Balding for a BT Sport Christmas Day Special, ‘Clare Balding Meets’, the same show on which Ferguson says Mourinho's list of attributes were 'unfair'.

Ferguson's relationship with his Portuguese counterpart blossomed despite an intense club rivalry at the top of the Premier League, with the pair adopting a tradition of sharing a glass of red after their teams' encounters.

They became so close that Sir Alex confided in Mourinho when he knew he was to retire from management in 2013.

But could it have been different after an error with the wine served when the duo first met at Stamford Bridge in the Premier League? Jose explains.

'It was Chelsea Football Club catering that bought the wine, and obviously the wine was not the top quality that the boss deserves. It was quite funny but disappointing. 

'So the next time we play against each other, I called a friend and I told him, the best I want the best. 

'And from that moment always the same bottle when I play against the boss.'

Mourinho's relationship with Ferguson stretches back as far as 2004, when the former's celebration along the touchline at Old Trafford grabbed the headlines as Porto knocked United out on their way to a Champions League triumph.

The Scot spoke to Balding about how Jose's ability to speak five languages, his looks, and the fact that he wins everything was 'unfair' and described him as the perfect example.

And Mourinho was even more complimentary about Sir Alex when asked what made the 72-year-old special.

'Everything, his talent, the time he put his talent at the service of Manchester United and football in general. 

The passion that he has put in to everything, and after that in private moments, obviously, a good friend, a good person, a fantastic sense of humour. I like him very, very much. 

Now and again I've had questions to put to him and the way he has answered to me was always magnificent and a great support.'
