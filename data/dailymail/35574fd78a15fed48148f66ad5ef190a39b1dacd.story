Police in San Francisco are being accused of heavy-handed tactics after a video showing officers making several arrests at a block of flats.

The YouTube video, taken on a cell phone, has sparked claims of 'police brutality' as well as a protest at the Mission substation last night.

About 100 people marched along the road and stood outside the electricity distribution centre. Police watched over the protest in riot gear as the angry residents shouted 'police brutality', NBC reports.

Arrests: Police in San Francisco are being accused of heavy-handed tactics after a video showing officers making several arrests at a block of flats

Police Chief Greg Suhr said the incident originally started because a 20-year-old man was asked to stop riding their bike on the sidewalk but then escalated quickly into a 'tremendously resistive situation'.

D'Paris Charles Williams was arrested on Friday when members of the city’s violence reduction team ordered him to stop riding his bicycle on the sidewalk in the Valencia Gardens Housing Complex.

Mr Suhr said: 'Why the desperation to avoid this police contact which would be just a simple citation for riding on the sidewalk?

'From what I see in the video, the officers are also being punched at. Our rule is they can use whatever force reasonable to overcome the resistance,'

In the six-minute clip, several police cars are parked in the middle of the road and scores of people line the sides of the road shouting at the police.

Police arrested four people, including one man who came up bloody after being taken down.

Five officers were injured; two went to the hospital.

Williams was released by police last night and Mr Suhr says the incident is under investigation.
