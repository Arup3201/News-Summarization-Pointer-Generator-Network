Comedians used to portray them as bossy and interfering, but research reveals spending time with your mother-in-law can actually make you happier.

Experts claim the findings point to the importance of relationships in happiness and wellbeing.

Those who have frequent contact with both a mother and mother-in-law benefit from two sources of close maternal support, they say.

‘It reflects the importance of having a close family unit,’ said  Dr Melissa Weinberg of Australia’s Deakin University.

‘This shows that people with a balanced family life are likely to have higher well-being than those who are seeing more of one side of the family and less of the other.’

If a relationship is maintained with only one mother figure ‘then there is an imbalance in the family, perhaps with disappointment or even resentment by the non-connected partner,’ the study concluded.

Wellbeing Index: The Australian Unity Wellbeing Index was carried out by researchers at Deakin University in Victoria

The Australian Unity Wellbeing Index found those who had weekly contact with their mother and mother-in-law had a wellbeing score of 78.7, well above the normal range of 73.7-76.7.

Those in frequent contact with their mother had a well-being score of 74 out of 100 and those who saw their mother-in-law scored 73.1.

Those who rarely or never saw either their mother and mother-in-law had a below average well being score of 71.6.

Family first: For the first time, the survey also asked people how they would spend two hours a week to do anything they wanted. Most people chose to spend it with their family (12%) while the smallest proportion chose sex

The telephone survey of 2000 Australians found that overall personal wellbeing, a measure of people's satisfaction with their own lives, has remained virtually unchanged since late 2011.

For the first time, the survey asked people how they would spend two hours a week to do anything they wanted.

Most people chose to spend it with their family (12%) while the smallest proportion chose sex (0.2%).

The survey also found men wanted to spend their time surfing, golfing and fishing, while women wanted to spend their two hours reading.
