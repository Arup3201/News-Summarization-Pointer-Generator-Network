Former Warrington centre Ryan Shaw has become Bradford's seventh new face for 2015, taking head coach James Lowes' squad total to 21.

Shaw, who has scored nine tries in 25 appearances for Championship club Barrow this year, has signed a one-year contract with the Bulls.

'This is a massive opportunity for me to really prove myself and kick on,' said the goal-kicking Shaw, who can also play at full-back and on the wing.

'I have signed for the next 12 months but want to ensure a much longer stay. The only way I will be able to do that is by earning another contract through hard work.

'I am very committed to that and want to be a part of the side for years to come.'

Lowes, who coached the Barrow-born Shaw during his time with the Wolves, said: 'Ryan is a young, up and coming talent who I know very well.

'He was just coming into the junior ranks when I was at Warrington, so I know what he is capable of bringing to the party.

'Ryan has bags of potential. He is very quick, knows his way to the line and can kick goals. I believe he has all the tools.'
