Mary Kidson, 55, is accused of trying to harm her child by giving her medication that she did not need

A mother accused of poisoning her daughter with a cocktail of drugs went 'doctor shopping' for a diagnosis, a leading expert in children's medicine has said.

Dr Neil Fraser, a specialist in treating hormonal disorders in children, also told jurors hearing the case against Mary Kidson it was 'vanishingly rare' for hormonal disease to develop in children, which had not already being diagnosed at birth.

Ms Kidson is accused of three counts of unlawfully and maliciously administering drugs, endangering life or inflicting grievous bodily harm, with all the offences alleged to have happened between 2010 and March 2013.

The 55-year-old was arrested in March last year after police searched her £475,000 home in Ledbury, Herefordshire, and found 'a very large amount' of medication.

Her daughter, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was given thyroid extract and oestrogen tablets.

On the second day of the trial today in Worcester Crown Court, Dr Fraser was asked by John Causer, for the prosecution, about Ms Kidson taking her daughter to various doctors and clinics for assessments.

'Normally, once a person has had the common opinion of two or three of the most respected doctors in different parts of the country one might accept the conclusion was genuine and correct but when it gets to eight or more opinions then clearly something is wrong,' Dr Fraser replied.

He added: 'It's commonly known as doctor shopping, going around as many as you can until you get the answer you want.'

The jury heard how Ms Kidson had, over the years, taken her daughter to several different doctors and put her through a number of assessments to test for an autistic spectrum disorder, speech and language issues and hormonal conditions.

At one such assessment, it was concluded 'no significant learning difficulties' were identified, with staff stating that a complaint the girl suffered with 'sensory perception difficulty' was never directly observed, but only reported by Ms Kidson herself.

Dr Fraser said Ms Kidson had then sought 'other opinions' from several doctors across the Midlands, and was eventually referred to Great Ormond Street Hospital.

'She (the daughter) was assessed and it was concluded that her formal test results were normal,' he said.

Prosecutor John Causer told Worcester Crown Court, pictured, that Kidson had then gone from 'doctor to doctor' until she found one who 'told her what she wanted to hear'

He added: 'The important thing there is that the formal tests were normal, and it only identified there might be a problem in one small area of development (auditory processing).'

Dr Fraser - whose expertise was called in for the serious case review into murdered toddler Daniel Pelka - said an autistic spectrum test was also later carried out, but concluded there was 'no diagnosis of an autistic spectrum disorder'.

Asked to look at the case history by the Crown, Dr Fraser had compiled a report drawing on the experiences of three paediatricians and read from its pages during proceedings.

He told jurors how at an early age Ms Kidson's daughter had been reported to have had 'delayed language development, but by the age of nine or ten, had none at all'.

However he said he had 'insufficient information' to be able to conclude whether the severe language problems had been based on what Ms Kidson's mother may have told speech therapists.

Dr Fraser also said that on another occasion, Ms Kidson had taken her daughter for a private MRI scan over regular headaches, and told clinicians her daughter was suffering with lethargy, and delayed puberty.

However, he said the MRI scan had turned up 'minor changes', at the time put down to a possible stroke suffered in early childhood, while Ms Kidson's daughter had developed 'later than average, but not abnormally'.

Turning to the function of the adrenal glands, which produce hormones, Mr Causer asked Dr Fraser about 'the way Ms Kidson has approached adrenal function' in relation to her daughter.

Dr Fraser said the case history suggested Ms Kidson 'had concluded her daughter had a problem with the adrenal gland and treating it would be a good idea'.

He added there was 'nothing in the history of examination to suggest this was a genuine medical diagnosis'.

Dr Fraser said that in 27 years of service at Birmingham Children's Hospital he saw 'only a handful' of cases of children with hormone disease, which had developed after birth, describing it as 'extremely uncommon'.

'It is very unusual when it happens and there will usually be a specific cause for it, found upon investigation.'

The medical history showed, he said, that when tested, Ms Kidson's daughter's results returned 'a normal response'.

Opening the trial yesterday, prosecutor John Causer told Worcester Crown Court, that Kidson had gone from 'doctor to doctor' until she found one who 'told her what she wanted to hear'.

'The daughter's health and emotional well-being we're harmed by being shopped around and saddled with treatment which was harmful to her.

'We're not saying that Mary Kidson set out to harm her daughter or that she is not a loving mother but the consequences of these actions - even of a loving mother - can be very harmful.

'Mrs Kidson has taken her daughter from doctor to doctor until she found one who told her what she wanted to hear.'

He said that other evidence will be given, noting that computer evidence and 'a very large amount' of medication was seized in a house search by police in March last year.

Speaking of the risks posed by the medication, Mr Causer said that in the case of the hydrocortisone, Ms Kidson's daughter was given three times the recommended daily dose and that the effects of suddenly stopping taking the drug were 'extremely dangerous'.

He said that the taking of oestrogen could 'result in various undesirable physical developments in the patient', while taking thyroid extract was 'undoubtedly harmful' and could lead to increased bone fractures and heart disease.

Mr Causer said it had taken weeks for the victim's thyroid gland 'to recover from taking thyroid extract she did not need'.

He also told the jury the matter was 'not an easy case - it's highly emotional', but he urged them to put that to one side as they heard the subsequent days of evidence.

He said: 'We're not saying that Mary Kidson set out to harm her daughter or that she is not a loving mother but the consequences of these actions - even of a loving mother - can be very harmful.'

Ms Kidson, appearing in custody but formerly of Dymock Road in Ledbury, Herefordshire, denies the charges. The trial, which is expected to last between two and three weeks, continues.
