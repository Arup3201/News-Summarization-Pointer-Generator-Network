A drugs raid was carried out on the 'pot club' of the Alaskan reporter who quit her job live on air to fight for legalized weed, after reports surfaced of illegal marijuana sales on the premises.

Charlo Greene's Alaska Cannabis Club was raided by Anchorage police who served search warrants on Friday afternoon.

The police took marijuana and impounded a Dodge Dakota and a Jeep Liberty, according to a report from KTUU.

Quit: Reporter Charlo Greene gained notoriety when she quit her job on live TV in September with an expletive and announced she was becoming an advocate to legalize marijuana in Alaska

Greene, a former television reporter gained notoriety when she quit her job on live TV in September with an expletive and announced she was becoming an advocate to legalize marijuana in Alaska.

The former newswoman, whose legal name is Charlene Egbe, told KTVA that the club was a medical marijuana dispensary only and denied that any sales had been carried out.

'We don't sell any recreational marijuana. We don't sell any medical marijuana. This is a place for cardholders to come and share their own cannabis,' she said.

Greene said that the residence was home to multiple medical marijuana cardholders, as well as the club.

And she appears to have received celebrity support  from rapper Snoop Dogg (Snoop Lion) who was pictured wearing a top with Alaska Cannabis club' emblazoned on it on her Facebook page.

Greene said during the raid: 'I saw [police] uproot a couple of marijuana plants. They took some bongs and pipes and phones and computers, and that's pretty much it.'

However, despite the raid, Greene reopened the club on Saturday.  

Anger: Greene, pictured here standing in front of drug paraphernalia said she was 'incensed' the police executed a search warrant on her instead of focusing on a stabbing and shootings nearby on the same day

'By opening back up bright and early, less than 24 hours after the local police department's failed scare tactic, we, at the Alaska Cannabis Club, have made it clear that the will of the people is stronger than any force they have — and we aren't going anywhere,' she told the Associated Press.

Greene said she was 'incensed' the police executed a search warrant on her instead of focusing on a stabbing and shootings that happened nearby just a few hours before.

Alaska voters last year approved a ballot measure legalizing the recreational use of marijuana. But it's still illegal to sell the drug.

Guidelines for the regulation of the marijuana trade are under consideration by the Legislature.

Anchorage Police Department spokeswoman Jennifer Castro said it's 'very important that people don't try to jump the gun until the state sets our other rules and protocols for the sale and commercialization of marijuana.'

No arrests have been made or charges filed in connection with the raid.
