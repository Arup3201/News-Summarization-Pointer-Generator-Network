Patients in a taxpayer-funded rehab centre were sent rake leaves in one boss's garden and hand wash his wife's knickers and bras, it is claimed.

Murray Kaplan, court liaison for the J-CAP programme in Queens, New York, had former junkies over to his Westhampton home to do chores, sources told the New York Post.

Now New York's office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services has launched an investigation into the allegations after hearing of them from the paper, which described the incidents as amounting to 'slave labour'.

The shop front for J-CAP's Admissions Office on Sutphin Boulevard, Jamaica , New York: The drug-rehab organisation has been mired in controversy over claims that one worker asked addicts to do his housework

'You have identified issues which we will now investigate,' an agency spokesman told Post reporters.

The allegations come from former workers and patients at J-CAP, which offers residential care for up to 400 addicts to help them kick their drug habits.

One worker told The Post of a veteran who lived at J-CAP who often visited Mr Kaplan's home. Then one day she turned up back at the clinic in tears, claiming she had been told to handwash Mr Kaplan's wife's lingerie.

Another veteran resident of J-CAP told the post that Mr Kaplan asked him to rake leaves around his house, then paid him off with some hotdogs, $20 and a pack of cigarettes.

Citing its sources, The Post claimed that Mr Kaplan had other recovering addicts for 'favours'. They included asking one to help move clothing from Manhattan to the home of Joseph Strasburg, head of the Rent Stabilisation Association.

Mr Kaplan said he brings patients from J-CAP over to his house to enjoy the pool and have picnics, but he denied claims that he gets them to do his housework or any other chores.

He told The Post: 'We have plenty of help in the house. We have gardeners. Certainly, nobody came over to do any work.'

Mr Strasburg would not comment, The Post reported. MailOnline contacted J-Cap for comment, but nobody was available.

J-CAP is a taxpayer-funded residential drug treatment programme for adults founded in the early 1970s. Its website says its facilities can cater for as many as 400 patients in a group therapy setting.

Patients are expected to contribute to the daily operation of what it calls 'the community', sharing in tasks such as housekeeping and meal preparation.

The non-profit organisation, whose name stands for Just Caring About People, also runs a special programme for veterans, who are often at greater risk of alcohol and drug abuse.

Patients are often referred to J-CAP by the courts, although the organisation says it accepts referrals 'from a variety of sources'.

Its website says: 'We value our human and civil rights to education, health, dignity, privacy, confidentiality, and a desire to achieve real freedom from exploitation and harm.'

But its future could be in doubt. The Post reports further reports that J-CAP has closed its biggest unit and is curtailing other programmes.
