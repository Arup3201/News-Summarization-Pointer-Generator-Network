So does one still rule the waves?

That may have been the question asked by the Queen yesterday - and the unimpressed look that followed may have revealed the answer

She may well have been concerned to learn how much Britain's naval might has diminished since 1977.

Her Majesty was being shown a chart outlining the current strength of the Royal Navy at Whitehall's Admiralty House as the Duke of Edinburgh finally received his birthday present.

The Duke was given  the office of titular head of the Navy, for his 90th on June 10.

For a man who has achieved much in his years the Queen may have been in a quandary as to what to get her husband.

But as a former Navy officer it was fitting the title of Lord High Admiral of the Navy - which dates back to the 14th century - was chosen as a gift.

Philip gave up his promising career on the seas to devote his life to Royal duty and support his wife in her role as Sovereign.

And yesterday at Admiralty House, the former home of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, the Duke received the Letters Patent as the holder of the title, as the Queen watched.

In the 18th century building's Admiralty Boardroom - where Nelson attended meetings and the Navy Board still meets today - Philip saw the formal document.

He listened intently as a senior naval officer gave a brief speech on the history of the title which had been held by the Queen since 1964 until this summer.

When the description turned to the previous holder before the Queen, the Duke of Clarence, later William IV, Philip laughed when told that the royal had argued with his advisory council 'and when in 1828 he led a squadron out for manoeuvres without consulting either his council, the King or the Duke of Wellington and was gone, no one knew where, for 10 days it proved too much and he was asked to resign'.

During the event, Philip was wearing a flesh-coloured plaster on both ears above the lobe, but a Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said she did not believe it was anything serious.

Admiral Sir Mark Stanhope, the First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff, hosted the event, which featured senior naval officers as well as rank-and-file sailors.

Philip and the Queen watched a display of precision drumming by five members of the Royal Marines Corps of Drummers in the courtyard outside the building and also attended a reception for senior naval officers and ordinary servicemen before having lunch with the Navy's top brass.

The Duke is an admiral of the fleet and the military uniform he wore today is the same outfit he was dressed in on his wedding day in 1947.

The birthday gift from the Queen could be seen as a touching acknowledgement of the sacrifices the Duke has made for his wife.

Had
 he not become the monarch's husband, some believe he would have been 
First Sea Lord, the professional head of the Royal Navy.

In an ITV interview to mark his 90th year, he was asked how he felt giving up his job as a Royal Navy officer.

'I
 don't know how difficult it was, it was naturally disappointing,' he 
replied. 'I had just been promoted to commander and the fact was that 
the most interesting part of my naval career was just starting.'

Philip joined the Navy after leaving school and in May 1939 enrolled at the Royal Naval College, in Dartmouth, where he was singled out as best cadet.

He rose rapidly through the ranks, earning promotion after promotion, but his life was to take a very different course.

During the Second World War, Philip served with the Mediterranean and Pacific fleets, and reached the rank of commander before his flourishing naval career came to a premature end in 1951.

The health of his father-in-law George VI was deteriorating and Queen-in-waiting Princess Elizabeth was required to take on more royal responsibilities.

Philip stepped down from his active role in the forces to fulfil his duty as her consort.

His wife acceded to the throne within the year when the King died in February 1952.
