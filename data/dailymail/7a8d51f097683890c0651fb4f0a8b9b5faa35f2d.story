Neil Warnock made an unexpected return as Crystal Palace boss on Wednesday and is poised to bring Wilfried Zaha with him.

The 65-year-old has been confirmed as Tony Pulis’s successor on a two-year deal, pipping Steve Clarke to the post. And Warnock will launch an immediate move to bring Manchester United misfit Zaha back to Selhurst Park on a season-long loan for a £1.5million fee.

Warnock, who managed Palace for three years from 2007, has four days to strengthen his squad ahead of the transfer deadline. However, Palace are sweating over their move for Southampton midfielder Jack Cork. The club were close to completing the Saint’s capture ahead of Warnock’s arrival but the 25-year-old is now set to make a decision over the next 48 hours.

Meanwhile, there is unlikely to be any ill-feeling between Warnock and Palace forward Jason Puncheon despite their public spat earlier this year.

Puncheon questioned Warnock’s integrity after the manager criticised him for his penalty miss against Tottenham in January.

Warnock considered taking legal action and Puncheon later apologised for his outburst and was fined £15,000 by the FA for his comments.

Sportsmail understands the pair have resolved their differences but Warnock could still look to offload Puncheon if the right offer comes along.

Palace are also keen on drafting Notts County manager Shaun Derry into their new-look coaching set-up.
