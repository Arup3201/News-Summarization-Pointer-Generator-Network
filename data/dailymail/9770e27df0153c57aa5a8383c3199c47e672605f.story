Sportsmail's Jonathan McEvoy exclusively revealed the news on Wednesday that Jenson Button is staying at McLaren

Jenson Button relived the moment on Thursday he received the call he feared would never come.

It was Monday and McLaren chairman Ron Dennis spoke to offer him a Formula One race seat for next season. ‘He put the options to me,’ said Button. ‘I just said yes.’ That night, he confesses, was a blur of celebration.

Never mind that the deal involved an annual pay cut of about £4million, to £8m, he jumped at the chance to realise his father’s ambition for him — to race alongside Fernando Alonso, who has joined from Ferrari.

On Thursday, Button, who only finally inked his new contract on Wednesday night, was still wreathed in smiles at the pair’s unveiling at McLaren’s Surrey headquarters.

The man who was vying for Button’s seat, 22-year-old Dane Kevin Magnussen, handled himself manfully as he was paraded as the team’s test and reserve driver.

He was given his bad news by Dennis on Tuesday. From being the long-term favourite to partner Alonso, his career had suddenly stalled.

Dennis tried to console Magnussen in his comments. ‘Look at his poor little face,’ he said at one point. It sounded more patronising than Dennis intended.

And, after all, Magnussen was his original choice for the seat.

So what happened? How did Button replace the Dane in McLaren’s affections?

The answer seems to lie in the complicated boardroom dynamics at Woking. A well-placed source has told Sportsmail that the other shareholders, the Bahrain Sovereign Wealth Fund and Saudi Arabian businessman Mansour Ojjeh, who has fallen out with his old friend Dennis, combined to save Button from the sack.

The ins and outs were not important on Thursday amid the smiles and back-slapping. Button, one of the most popular and respected drivers on the grid, said: ‘This is where my heart has always been — racing with such an amazing partnership.

‘And I have enormous respect for Fernando. I don’t want to mention my late father (John) too much but, probably as much as me winning the world championship, he wanted me and Fernando to race on the same team together.’

Alonso’s arrival at the Woking-based team, on a three-year deal worth £75m, was in the pipeline long before the McLaren hierarchy decided on Button’s future.

‘Secret’ conversations between the team and Alonso began in September 2013, though he admits he was only truly convinced to move this past summer.

Alonso’s return is somewhat surprising given the acrimonious year he spent at McLaren in 2007.

 ‘That experience meant that something wasn’t right in my career,’ said the Spaniard. ‘It’s time to change that.’

Dennis’s take on the upheavals was to apportion blame on the ‘immaturity’ of Alonso’s then team-mate Lewis Hamilton.

He said: ‘If you go down the “who struck the first blow?” route, I would say Lewis.’
