It was supposed to be a moment of triumph and skill - arms thrown wide in jubilation after an arduous climb.

But one cyclist's attempt to show off for the cameras took a turn for the worse as he lost his balance and plunged ingloriously into a grass verge.

Matt Adams, a 36-year-old IT manager was just about to crest Box Hill in Surrey - part of the 2102 Olympic road cycling route - when he spotted a photographer and spread his arms wide with a grin.

Look mum, no hands! Matt Adams, 36, was climbing Box Hill in Surrey when he made his triumphant - and doomed - gesture

Pride before a fall: Mr Adams manages to hold the pose for a brief second - but disaster is looming...

Turn for the worse: The IT manager's triumph turns sour as he swerves towards the verge

Downfall: With no hope of recovery, Mr Adams begins to fly over the handlebars, arms outstretched

But the exuberant gesture was to be his downfall, as just seconds after striking the pose, his wheels wobbled and he lost control of the bicycle.

The sportsman, of Basingstoke, Hampshire, stretched out his hands and went tumbling sideways towards the grassy verge. With one arm he tried to wrestle the handlebars back, but had already lost his grip and could only prepare for the worst.

Mr Adams - who was uninjured by 
his misadventure - was cycling in the London Revolution Sportive bicycle
 race. The 185-mile event was well into its second day by the time Mr 
Adams and his fellow cyclists reached the famous Box Hill incline.

Before
 his moment of pride and folly, he would have cycled through Windsor 
Park, and past Ascot racecourse. The route also cut through central 
London, where the racers passed over Tower Bridge.

Flying: The cyclist, thankfully wearing a helmet, flings his other arm in front of him as he braces for impact

Bottoms up: Mr Adams's bicycle tipped and his saddle flew high as he made his inelegant descent

Paradise lost: Mr Adams - who wasn't hurt by his fall - turned red-faced towards his fellow riders and passing traffic

Not the descent he had in mind: Mr Adams slips a few places as the competition zooms by

Lycra-clad Mr Adams hardly finds himself alone in his enthusiasm for competitive cycling, fuelled, some say, by the notable successes of British champions including Sir Chris Hoy, Sir Bradley Wiggins, Jessica Pendleton and Chris Froome.

England will once again play host to world-class cycling in two months' time, when two stages of the Tour de France will be held in Yorkshire. Riders will pedal 190km from Leeds to Harrogate on Saturday, July 5, then 200km from York to Sheffield on Sunday 6.

The following day riders will head from Cambridge to London before continuing in France.

In recent years the sport has gone from strength to strength throughout Britain, with 99,000 more people cycling now than in 2008. According to a recent survey by Sport England, over 2million people now cycle at least once a week.

Figures compiled by British Cycling show that 25,000 Britons compete regularly in cycling events, with more than 3,500 races taking place every year.

In taking on the Box Hill climb, Mr Adams joined a long line of cycling Olympians - though they mostly remain upright during the attempt.

British champions Chris Froome and Bradley Wiggins, who both won medals in 2012, took on the ascent during the road race event. However, though they rode to triumph in other races, road cycling was not to be theirs, with Wiggins finishing at number 103 and Froome at 109.

Alexander Vinokourov of Kazakhstan came away with the gold medal that day, boasting a time of 5 hours, 45 minutes and 57 seconds.
