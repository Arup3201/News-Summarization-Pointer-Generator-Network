A teenage girl has been charged with robbery after she was caught lying on Facebook about her involvement in the fatal ambush.

Haley McKibben, 18, was allegedly involved in a plan to rob 23-year-old John Kinsey Jr who was found shot dead in his car last Saturday in Indianapolis, Indiana.

McKibben was asked to 'set up' Kinsey by Julius Gordon, 19, so that the pair could rob him of a stash of marijuana and Xanax, according to an affidavit seen by Daily Mail Online.

The 18-year-old reportedly got in the car to smoke with Kinsey and then sent a text message to Gordon to let him know where they were parked.

Haley McKibben, 18, has been charged with felony robbery for her part in an ambush on John Kinsey, 23, who was fatally shot in his car, allegedly by Julius Gordon (right), for his stash of Xanax and marijuana

She also warned Gordon that Kinsey was armed. 

The 23-year-old was later found dead in his blue Buick with a gun and his driver's window shattered.

Police named Gordon as a possible suspect when he went to hospital to be treated for a gunshot wound.  

The teenage girl at first told police she had been sitting with Kinsey in his car when someone tried to rob him. 

She was shown pictures of potential suspects - including Gordon - but said that she did not recognize anyone.

Investigators then took to Facebook - and found that Gordon and McKibben were friends on social media. 

Police then discovered phone records of their text messages. 

Gordon has been charged with two counts of murder, robbery and being a felon in possession of a handgun. 

McKibben has been charged with robbery. Both suspects were being held in the Marion County Jail.
