The fatal shooting on Saturday in Ferguson of unarmed teenager Michael Brown has caused more than a decade of seething racial tensions between the police and public in the St. Louis suburb to finally boil over.

Indeed, in this town of 21,000 people, of which two-thirds are African American, their now beleaguered police force of 53 can only claim to have three officers who are black.

Worse still, an annual report last year from Missouri's attorney general found that in Ferguson, if you were African American, you were twice as likely to be arrested during a traffic stop than a white person.

Residents in Ferguson have become so used to this that they have dubbed it DWB, or driving while black.

According to Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster, while blacks make up 67 percent of the population in Ferguson, they account for 86 percent of the traffic stops made last year.

And according to The Washington Post,  92 percent of those stops end with an arrest for the black driver.

Last year, the NAACP filed a federal complaint against the St. Louis County police department, who are currently working with Ferguson's force to quell the nightly riots, over huge disparities in arrests.

The Washington Post also claims that a former lieutenant with the county police was fired in 2013 after an internal investigation found he had told officers to specifically target black people across the county.

After this troubling discovery, St. Louis County Executive asked for all recent arrest statistics to discover the depth of racial profiling.

The problems apparent in the violent clashes between heavily armed white SWAT officers and angry African American protestors began roughly a decade ago in Ferguson.

In 2000, blacks counted slightly over half of Ferguson's population, while white people accounted for 44 percent.

Now, white people make up only 30 percent of the population, but nearly 100 percent of the police force.

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson acknowledged the structural problems in his department.

'Apparently, there has been this undertow that has bubbled to the surface,' Jackson said on Wednesday.

'It’s our priority to address it and to fix what’s been going wrong.'

'I’ve been trying to increase the diversity of the department ever since I got here,' Jackson said on Wednesday to The Washington Post.

'Race relations is a top priority right now.'

But while Jackson is claiming he wants to listen now, other residents of Ferguson are saying it is too late.

'People here are angry, frustrated,' said Corey Crawford, 36 to The Washington Post.

'There needs to be justice. If you can find a single person in this community who trusts the police, that is like finding a four-leafed clover.'

Across the country there is though an understanding that something must be done.

St. Louis County asked researchers from the University of California at Los Angeles to help improve their perceived racial profiling and to work on their procedures.

However, distrust is still strong.

Take Jackson's refusal to confirm how many times Brown was shot for example.

He has categorically refused to do so and more importantly, name the officer who fired up to eight times at the 18-year-old.

Police claim their was a physical confrontation after Brown refused to obey the police officers, other eyewitnesses claim that Brown was essentially executed while he had his hands in the air.

While Jackson said he wanted to mend fences with the community, protesters were on the streets of Ferguson again Wednesday, facing heavily armed police who at time trained weapons on them from an armored truck.

Jackson has faced mounting demands from protesters, clergy and even hackers to reveal the identity of the officer who shot Brown.

Jackson argues that revealing that detail could bring retribution to the officer.

Police have said Brown was shot after an officer encountered him and another man on the street.

They say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over the officer's weapon. At least one shot was fired inside the car.

The struggle then spilled onto the street, where Brown was shot multiple times. In their initial news conference about the shooting, police didn't specify whether Brown was the person who scuffled with the officer in the car and have refused to clarify their account.

Jackson said Wednesday that the officer involved sustained swelling facial injuries.

Dorian Johnson, who says he was with Brown when the shooting happened, has told a much different story. He has told media outlets that the officer ordered them out of the street, then tried to open his door so close to the men that it "ricocheted" back, apparently upsetting the officer.

Johnson says the officer grabbed his friend's neck, then tried to pull him into the car before brandishing his weapon and firing.

He says Brown started to run and the officer pursued him, firing multiple times. Johnson and another witness both say Brown was on the street with his hands raised when the officer fired at him repeatedly.

Some protesters Wednesday raised their arms above their heads as they faced the police. Others held signs asking for answers about Brown's death.

The most popular chant has been, 'Hands up! Don't shoot!'

Brown's body remained on the street for hours - a span Jackson deemed "uncomfortable" but justified, given that 'you only get one chance at that crime scene' to process it correctly.

Jackson said authorities also were concerned about gunfire they could hear in a nearby building.

In the shooting's aftermath, the notorious hacking collective Anonymous has taken credit for burrowing into the city website and shutting it down for much of the day Monday.

The group also released what it said were audio experts from St. Louis County dispatch on the day Brown was killed. Police declined to comment on the recordings.
