A hungry hyena has found a clever way to store its leftovers for another meal - by hiding them at the bottom of a waterhole.

Photographer Anja Denker, 46, said she spotted the hyena seemingly fishing in the water at the Chudop waterhole in Etosha, Namibia.

But on closer inspection it became clear that the predator was actually trying to dive for something specific.

Success: After a few attempts it came back to the surface with a chuck of meat proudly locked in its jaws - ripped from a carcass

After a few attempts it came back to the surface with a chuck of meat proudly locked in its jaws - ripped from a carcass left at the river bed.

Mrs Denker, from Windhoek, Namibia, said: ‘I found a lone hyena circling the middle of the waterhole with only its head sticking out.

‘I've seen hyenas sitting in water to cool themselves off before but never have I seen one this much submerged before.

‘To my absolute astonishment it proceeded to dive down head-first to the bottom and came up with something in its mouth.

‘I eventually came to the conclusion it was fishing - it proved very entertaining and I watched these antics for quite a while.

Getting in the action: This was the only spotted hyena displaying the skilled behaviour, according to the photographer

‘Looking at the photographs later that evening I studied the object in its mouth more closely and found it didn't resemble any fish.

‘Next morning I trundled off to the same waterhole and sure enough, the same hyena was doing exactly the same thing as the previous day.’

Mrs Denker set up her camera gear and waited for the hyena to bring something up to the surface and onto land.

She added: ‘The hyena came up with a large chunk of something and swam to shore.

‘Only then did it dawn on me there must be a carcass lying at the bottom of the waterhole.

‘Incidentally this was the only spotted hyena displaying this skilled behaviour - none of the other members of the clan attempted to follow suit.

‘Apparently hyena have been known to stash their food in water. 

'It's very likely this hyena stored the carcass and has gone back at intervals to retrieve it.

‘That's the beauty with interactions and observations like this - it's fascinating and we learn a lot about animal behaviour.’
