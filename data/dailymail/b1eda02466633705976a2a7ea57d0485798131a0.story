Former first lady of France Valerie Trierweiler has branded the country's politics 'misogynistic' and said female politicians encounter opposition as 'a matter of course'.

Ms Trierweiler, the ex-partner of French president Francois Hollande,  has written a tell-all book chronicling her seven years as his girlfriend - which ended when it was reported he was having an affair with actress Julie Gayet.

It is believed the book, Thank You For This Moment, could damage Mr Hollande's reputation with controversial claims he called the country's poor 'the toothless'.

Ms Trierweiler also claims in the book that Mr Hollande instructed for her to be given high doses of tranquillisers shortly after they had broken in order to keep her in hospital and out of his way.

In an interview with Kirsty Wark on the BBC's Newsnight, which will be broadcast tomorrow, Ms Trierweiler was asked: 'Is France misogynist?'

She said: 'In the realm of politics, yes. Women in politics encounter opposition as a matter of course.'

Ms Trierweiler told Sophie Raworth on BBC's Andrew Marr Show today that the book was not the revenge of a hurt woman.

She said: 'It's not revenge, it's not about destroying him, it's about me rebuilding myself.'

She was then asked if she was saying that she did not think he was suitable as a president.

She said: 'You know what political figures are like. They don't become president if they're not self-centred, or if they're not sometimes economic with the truth.

'I've followed other presidents in my professional career, I've only known one intimately, but the majority of them have these faults, in that they're completely egocentric.

'I don't think Francois Hollande has more faults than another president.'

Ms Raworth suggested that Ms Trierweiler had made an 'awful lot of money' out of the book.

Ms Trierweiler replied: 'Yes, well, I will next year, but that wasn't my primary objective.

'The media said, "don't read this book, don't buy this book", but people did anyway, because they wanted to know.

'And the majority of people say to me, "It's not at all what I was expecting, it's not a settling of scores, it's not a book of revenge, it's almost a love story". That's what my book is.'

When she was asked why she had written the book, Ms Trierweiler, a journalist, said: 'In fact I started writing it before knowing that it was going to become a book. 

'For me writing is a form of therapy, I started writing it when I wasn't feeling terribly well and that was a good reason for writing it.'

She said the title 'will remain a mystery, a message that only Francois Hollande himself will understand'.

She added: 'It's not a personal attack on Hollande at all, it is the story of our relationship, there are good moments and bad moments I describe in it.'

When asked about the tranquillisers, she said: 'I only know that he told me to take the medicines the next day and they were a higher dose than usual.'

In the Newsnight interview Ms Wark said: 'You called him king of the double speak with ambiguity and perpetual lies. So what kind of man was that?'

Ms Trierweiler said: 'Unfortunately, these are the characteristics of lots of politicians. These are the mysteries of love. I was in love with him.'

Asked if he really called the poor 'the toothless', she said 'of course'.

She added: 'This book wasn't aimed at destroying him; its aim was to help me rebuild my own life. 

'I've also said in the book that he is exceptional at times, abroad he comes across very well for instance.

'I think the book will be an electric shock for him.'

When she was asked if she was among the 65 per cent of French people who believe Mr Hollande should quit - according to a poll in Le Figaro - she said: 'No. Absolutely not.

'We must respect democracy, he was elected for a five-year term, he has two-and-a-half more years to prove himself.

'It's something he can do and believe he can be re-elected.'

The Newsnight interview will be broadcast tomorrow at 10.30pm.
