A seven-year old girl who told her family she felt like an 'outcast' has been inundated with messages of love and support from complete strangers.

Gabbie Sejas from Indiana, suffers from neurofibromatosis, a rare genetic disorder that causes tumors to grow in the nervous system and can trigger autistic-like tendencies.

Through tears she said that she hadn't received a single Christmas card or party invite from her peers at school. The revelation prompted her mother to launch an online 'card appeal'.

Difficulty fitting in: Gabbie Sejas (pictured with her mother Kandra), aged seven, who told her family she felt like an 'outcast' has been inundated with messages of love and support from complete strangers

In a bid to make her daughter feel 'accepted' Kandra Sejas set up a page on the non-profit website Monkee See - Monkee Do titled 'Cards for Gabbie' and left her home address in the hope that people would respond.

She wrote: 'My seven-year-old daughter has a neurological disorder [which] . . .  causes developmental delays and behaviors similar to autistic children. 

'As you can imagine, she has a hard time with social interactions and making friends.

'In the past couple weeks she has come very upset about the lack of friendships, noting that lately kids have been given out cards, but not to her. 

'There are 
some things that money cannot buy, and that is feeling like you are 
loved and accepted'

'I am assuming that they are invitations
to parties she is not invited too. She said through tears, ''Mom, why 
don't I ever get cards?'''

'So, She would love it. There are 
some things that money cannot buy, and that is feeling like you are 
loved and accepted. That is what I want for my baby girl.'

To date Gabbie has received around 50 messages of support from as far away as England and Australia with more pouring in every day.

'The
response [has been] absolutely overwhelming . . . the first time she 
got [a card], she screamed at the top of her lungs,' Mrs Sejas told Today.

Reaching out: Kandra Sejas set up a page on the non-profit website Monkee See - Monkee Do titled 'Cards for Gabbie' and left her home address in the hope that people would respond

One respondent wrote on the Cards for Gabbie campaign page today, under the title You are Loved by A Friend in Florida: 'Dear Gabbie, a card from Tampa is coming your way.

'It is never easy to be a little different, but some of the greatest people in the world have been different.

'They went on to discover great medicine, travel to outer space and be wonderful Moms and Dads.

'She wants so badly to have friends and to be accepted. It's heartbreaking to have a child who doesn't fit in'

'They went on to discover great medicine,
travel to outer space and be wonderful moms and dads.

'Whatever you want to do I know you'll be great too.'

Another added: 'Hi Gabbie from Chicago. I wanted to let you know that I think you are a beautiful [and] brave little girl. It is very hard to understand all of this at such a young age.

'One day when you get older you will 
understand that those people that treated you poorly are the one's that 
have the problems, not you sweet girl.

Neurofibromatosis is a genetic disorder that disturbs cell growth in the nervous system, causing tumors to form on tissues.

The tumors are usually benign, but in some cases they become cancerous.

People with neurofibromatosis often experience only mild symptoms including light brown spots or soft bumps on the skin, freckling in the armpits or groin area, bone deformities, learning disabilities and a larger than average head size.

Effects can range from hearing loss, learning impairment and cardiovascular complications to severe disability due to nerve compression by tumors, loss of vision and severe pain.

Neurofibromatosis treatment aims to maximize healthy growth and development and to manage complications as soon as they arise.

When the condition causes large tumors that press on a nerve, surgery may help ease symptoms.

Some people may benefit from other therapies, such as stereotactic radiosurgery, medications to control pain or physical therapy.

'Hold your head up high knowing that you have friends all over the world! You are very loved. God bless you.'

They also praised Mrs Sejas for coming up with initiative.

'What a wonderful gift you are giving to your baby girl,' they wrote.

Mrs Sejas now plans to decorate the Christmas tree with all of the cards that have been sent to Gabbie.

The
second-grader's condition known as neurofibromatosis, is a genetic 
disorder that causes tumors to grow in the nervous system and can lead 
to learning disabilities and developmental delays.

Currently she does not have any visible tumors, but has symptoms that mimic autism, such as social awkwardness.

Mrs Sejas said: 'She wants so badly to have friends and to be accepted. It’s heartbreaking to have a child who doesn’t fit in.

'For
the longest time, she didn’t realize that she was different, [but] the 
older she gets, the more she kind of figured out that maybe her brain 
works a little bit differently or maybe everybody else has a lot of 
friends and she doesn’t.'

Thanks to the card appeal Mrs Sejas says 
her daughter is feeling less alone now, and she also feels uplifted by the support.

'It’s just so reassuring [to have] people 
reaching out to me and telling me that I was a good mom . . . that was pretty
overwhelming, too.'
