A shocking photograph of a toddler drinking from a can of Bud Light at a Cleveland Browns' tailgating party has gone viral after it was posted online.

The photo was posted on Webstagram by John Cogar, a personalization specialist at Party City who lives in North Olmsted, Ohio.

He posted the image on Monday along with the comment 'starting early these days!'

The timing suggests the photo might have been taken at a tailgate on Sunday when the Cleveland Browns visited the Detroit Lions and lost 31:17.

Tailgate parties are a football ritual, with supporters gathering at the stadium carpark before a game for social festivities typically involving a barbeque and drinking.
