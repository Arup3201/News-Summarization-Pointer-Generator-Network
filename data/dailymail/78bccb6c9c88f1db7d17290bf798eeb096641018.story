A woman braved freezing temperatures when she jumped into a canal to save a drowning puppy.

Arleta Vakane, 38, spotted the seven-week-old cross-breed which has fallen into the Oxford Canal during last week’s cold snap, and did not hesitate to go in after it.

Ms Vakane was crossing a bridge near Banbury, Oxon when she heard loud whimpers and saw the helpless dog with only its nose above the water.

After trying to get hold of the terrier from shore, she jumped into the canal to come to its rescue.

Print operator Arleta rushed the dog to a nearby veterinary clinic where staff have now named the puppy Chilly, after its cold ordeal.

Ms Vakane said: ‘I heard this screaming, crying noise and when I looked I saw something moving in the middle of the canal.

‘As I got nearer I saw it was a puppy paddling in the water and trying to keep her nose out of the water - everything else, including her ears, had gone under.

‘The noise she was making was so loud - she was fighting for her life.

‘I laid in the snow and tried to grab her but the gap between us was too big, so I got into the water to reach her.’

Two days after last week's rescue, Arleta and Chilly were reunited and she says plans to keep the puppy, unless the owners come forward to claim her.

She said: ‘When I saw her again I 
couldn't believe it was the same dog. Her eyes are so bright but when I 
last saw them they looked half dead.

‘If I keep her I'll rename her Hope - because we all hoped she would survive.'

Veterinary surgeon Will Oldham, from Hawthorne Lodge Veterinary Practice, added: ‘When the puppy arrived she was shivering and barely conscious.

‘She was so cold it took an hour-and-a-half to read her temperature.

‘Given how cold it was she would not have survived another few minutes in that water.

‘She is a very, very lucky puppy - Arleta undoubtedly saved her life.

‘The area of the canal she went into is not very nice at all but her brave actions mean this story had a very happy ending.’
