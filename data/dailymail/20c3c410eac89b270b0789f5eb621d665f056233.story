Colombia striker Radamel Falcao is one of the hottest properties in world football and it appears that as well as having a good shot he strikes a mean baseball, too.

The Monaco forward missed the World Cup with a knee injury and is continuing his rehabilitation before the start of the French Ligue 1 season begins.

In a video posted on his Instagram account, Falcao displays his baseball skills and smashed one dangerously close to a friend at the other end of the nets.

The striker will be looking to find the net when his rehabilitation is complete.

However, in his absence, Monaco have been in impressive pre-season form, unbeaten and
scoring for fun.

Former Spurs striker Dimitar Berbatov has been notching up the
goals whilst Falcao has been sidelined.

However with fellow Colombian James Rodriguez signing for
Real Madrid, it seems the 28-year-old will be pivotal in Monacoâ€™s pursuit of
trophies this campaign.

Falcao has insisted he is 
happy to remain at Monaco this season, stressing he believes in 'the 
project' that is underway at the French side.

Despite
 reported interest from Spanish giants Real Madrid, where he would join former team-mate Rodriguez, Falcao
 is not thinking of leaving the principality any time soon.

He
 said at a recent press conference: 'I believe in Monaco's project. I 
want to stay here and play Champions League football with Monaco.'

Sidelined: Monaco will be keen for Falcao, who scored nine goals in 17 appearances last season, to return to action very soon, especially with the sale of James Rodriguez to Real Madrid this week
