A Philadelphia man chased his ex-girlfriend around a terminal Tuesday, following her into the woman's bathroom, in an attempt to swab her for a paternity test.

In a scene worthy of the 'Maury Show,' Elonte Chancellor-Brown, 22, chased his 19-year-old girlfriend around the 69th Street Terminal demanding a DNA swab from her in order to get a paternity test on their child, police say.

Chancellor-Brown and Raashan Coleman, 27, were given harassment citations after police received a 911 call from a woman claiming she had locked herself in a bathroom stall at the terminal to get away from a man with a gun, Philadelphia Daily News reports. 

'Brown was attempting to get a DNA swab from one of the victims as they have a child together and he was conducting a paternity test,' Michael Chitwood, Upper Darby Police superintendent, told Daily News.

The woman claimed Chancellor-Brown is the father of their child. 

Proud: The incident would have made Maury Povich proud, however, Chancellor-Brown never got the DNA swab

The victims went into the woman's bathroom to escape but the men followed them inside and the women locked themselves in one of the stalls.

Police responded and chased the men out of the bathroom, taking them into custody. Police say neither of the men had a weapon, Daily News reports.

The man never got the DNA swab, police say, and it remains unknown whether Chancellor-Brown is the child's father.
