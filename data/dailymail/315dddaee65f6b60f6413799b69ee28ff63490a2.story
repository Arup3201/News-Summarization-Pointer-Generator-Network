Most travellers will have had the misfortune of sitting next to an unruly or inconsiderate plane passenger at some point.

But spare a thought for the cabin crew who have to endure the irritations of poorly behaved customers on a daily basis.

In fact, flight attendants encounter such regular frustrations that they have now been moved to compile lists of passengers' most irritating habits.

Cabin crew are constantly badgered by demands for upgrades and requests to hold connecting flights

Air stewardess and blogger Sarah Steegar, who works for a major US airline, has revealed her biggest gripes, which include asking the crew to call ahead to hold connecting flights, and constantly asking for upgrades to business and first class.

She also admitted that passengers who display ‘aeroplane imperialism’ was a major source of irritation, particularly criticising those who leave litter around their seat.

Others have vented their anger at passengers who demand water immediately upon embarking the aircraft and ordering food with their headphones still on.

Below is a list of the most reviled passenger habits and questions, which have been detailed by Ms Steegar and others in online blog FlyerTalk, news.com.au and lifestyle website Thrillist.com. 

Inconsiderate passengers also frequently ask flight attendants to put their bags in the overhead lockers

Doing exercises in the aisles or the galley

One attendant joked to Thrillist.com: ‘Have you heard of that new fitness revolution sweeping the nation where you do yoga in the one space flight attendants have to do their jobs? Yeah, we haven't either’.

Passengers who notice empty seats in business class and ask to be upgraded

Occasionally passengers may be upgraded if there is a problem with their economy seats, but upgrades usually only occur at the check-in desk.

Passengers who ask flight attendants to put their bags in the overhead lockers

‘It’s simply not a flight attendant’s job to lift your bag into the overhead locker’, says Ms Steegar. ‘They can help push your bag further in once it’s up there, but lifting it causes too many injuries.’

Asking cabin staff to call ahead to hold a connecting flight

Ms Steegar explained that cabin crew do not have the authority to demand changes to flight schedules.

Economy passengers asking to use the first class bathroom

Flight crew never sanction passengers to move between the different class cabins.

According to lifestyle website Thrillist.com, attendants rarely find anything more annoying than passengers who keep their headphones in place when speaking to staff

Frequently asking to borrow pens

Although it may appear to be a harmless question, passengers apparently get hugely upset when cabin crew are unable to fulfil the request.

Leaving your headphones on while giving your drink order

According to lifestyle website Thrillist.com, attendants rarely find anything more annoying than passengers who keep their headphones in place when speaking to staff. 

‘It’s great that remixed Bonnie Tyler gets you super-pumped for that Sacramento to Boise flight, but keeping those Beats glued to your head and screaming “I'll take the whole can” is generally infuriating to everybody around you,' said one. 

Asking to arrange a switch between seats so a passenger can sit next to their friend

‘I know it’s no fun to travel separated, but I have no real authority to make people move’, says Ms Steegar. ‘If you’re asking me it means you saw that the seat map was full, you didn’t try at the gate. If it was easy it would have been done already, right?’

'Aeroplane imperialism'

Ms Steegar writes in her online blog: ‘This point involves behaviour that treats the aircraft like personal IKEA furniture. 

'Also, no nail clipping, no flossing, please. We want you to feel at home as in "very welcome", not for you to literally act like you are "at home".

'Or they might, say, leave the wall covered with stickers, which isn’t hurting anything, it seems. 

'Except somebody else has to take all those down like they’re the maid, when they only have 10 minutes to clean the whole cabin.'

The electronic device wars

Refusing to turn off electrical devices when asked to by the plane’s captain is a huge source of frustration for flight attendants.

Ms Steegar added: ‘When you act like I – or you – don’t know what "off" means, I start thinking "HULK SMASH!".

'Like when I had to say to a guy – repeatedly – "I know your iPad is not off because there are words on the screen".'

'Generalized obliviousness disorder'

‘Here’s how it plays out,’ says Ms Steegar. '"Please step out of the aisle". We repeat. We want to say, "See that line of people to the door? They’re not admiring you; they can’t get past you. Move into your row to dig that book out of your suitcase. I know it’s tight but you can do it".'

Passengers talking during safety demonstrations have become a constant source of anger for cabin crew

Demanding water immediately upon boarding

'Interestingly, they’ve got these places in airports now where they sell water in convenient plastic containers,' joked one unnamed attendant.

'Perhaps you should ask every other passenger on the plane, because they all seem to know about them.'

Talking loudly during the safety demo

One attendant succinctly revealed how frustrating this habit is for cabin crew, telling Thrillist.com: ‘Thank you kind sir for keeping the entire section posted on the latest trends in Las Vegas real estate - something that’s clearly more relevant to the entire plane than, say, HOW THE HELL TO GET OUT IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG.’
