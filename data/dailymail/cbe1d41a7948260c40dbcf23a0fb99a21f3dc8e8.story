Roman Polanski’s lawyer wants the media banned from court when it considers a US extradition request over the director’s 1977 conviction for having sex with an underage girl.

The 81-year-old, who was charged with unlawful sexual intercourse with a 13-year-old girl, will attend the hearing on Wednesday in his childhood city of Krakow, Poland.

His lawyer, Jan Olszewski, has asked the judge to ban media from the court in order to protect Polanski’s privacy and due to the circumstances of the case.

The Oscar-winning director, who is in the country preparing to make a movie about French Jew Alfred Dreyfus, is subject to an Interpol warrant in effect in 188 countries, though he is able to move freely between France, Poland and Switzerland.

Krakow prosecutors refused a request from US justice authorities last year to arrest Polanski but said there were no legal obstacles to the extradition, and have asked the court for a ruling. 

Polanski, director of classics like ‘Rosemary’s Baby’ and ‘Chinatown,’ pleaded guilty in 1977 to having sex with 13-year-old Samantha Geimer during a photoshoot in Los Angeles.

He served 42 days in jail as part of a 90-day plea bargain in 1977 before he fled the United States on the eve of his sentencing the following year.

In 2009, he was arrested in Zurich on a US warrant and placed under house arrest but was freed the following year after Swiss authorities decided not to extradite him.

In 2013, Mrs Geimer described in graphic detail for the first time what happened on the day of the attack in Jack Nicholson’s LA home.

In her book, ‘The Girl,’ she wrote about how Polanski told her mother he wanted to take pictures of the teen for French Vogue but would not allow her to accompany her daughter.

Describing the sexual assault, Mrs Geimer revealed that Polanski first plied her with champagne, taking pictures of her in the Jacuzzi in just her knickers before giving her a sleeping pill.

During the screening of a documentary of his life at the Zurich Film Festival in 2011, Polanski said Mrs Geimer was a ‘double victim’ after she was caught up in the media glare of his arrest in 2009.

The 81-year-old will attend the hearing on Wednesday in Krakow, Poland. Polanski won a Best Director Oscar for 2002's The Pints (pictured, a scene from the film)
