Book of revelations: The Rev Richard Coles is telling all about his wild life before finding God in 1990

Each weekend, the Reverend Richard Coles takes his two million Radio 4 listeners for a gentle stroll along the highways and byways of British life.

As presenter of the family chat show Saturday Live, his wit and whimsy has been likened to ‘the aural equivalent of Ovaltine’; Coles is often described as Britain’s most famous vicar — aside from the fictional central character of the BBC hit comedy Rev, also based on him.

He also has a ‘day job’. Twenty-four hours after broadcasting to the nation, the plump, bespectacled clergyman returns to the tranquillity of his role as Vicar of Finedon in Northamptonshire.

His 14th-century parish church of St Mary the Virgin has a fine ring of bells and an organ which is said to have been played by George Handel.

Nothing seismic has occurred in this backwater in the heart of England since the collapse of a landmark folly more than 60 years ago.

But that is likely to change this week with the publication of the Rev Coles’s autobiography, Fathomless Riches. His 150 or so parishioners have been warned by him to ‘brace themselves’, for the contents are as far removed from the memoirs of a traditional vicar as can be imagined.

‘I hadn’t realised quite how eventful my life had been until I sat down to write about it,’ he said this week. ‘The truth is, country parsons often have a more vivid past than you might think.’

But surely none is quite so colourful as his.

There is the gay promiscuity and ‘dogging’ with men in a local layby, week-long hard drugs binges, a lost year in Ibiza on Ecstasy and amphetamine, rave clubs, a suicide attempt, the deaths from Aids of so many friends, and his bizarre pretence over a number of years that he, too, was HIV positive, because he thought it made him seem more ‘glamorous’ on the gay scene.

One can almost hear the smashing of dropped tea cups across Finedon. And if all that doesn’t leave his flock agog, when he next takes evensong they might find themselves reflecting on the episode when he woke up in a warehouse with a tyre mark across his bare torso, without a clue as to how it had got there.

In his previous life he had been the instrumentalist half of the Eighties pop duo The Communards, who had a Number One single Don’t Leave Me This Way, and a number of other hits which made him millions.

If some of his parishioners feel they have already been given too much information about their vicar’s sexual past — Coles has been on a round of media interviews — much of what he admits in his book is deliberately unflattering to the point of self-flagellation.

He grew up in Northamptonshire and his parents, who were shoe manufacturers, sent him to a minor public school where he was a chorister and, to his horror, realised he was gay.

In his late teens he took a drug overdose, partly because in the Seventies being homosexual ‘was like being a paedophile now — it was a life which seemed to offer only disgrace’.

Coles moved to London where he met Jimmy Somerville, the Scot who became his singing partner in The Communards. Success came fast and they had the UK’s biggest-selling single of 1986.

But Coles was not entirely at ease with this sudden fame. He felt he was the gawky, bespectacled, musically trained geek who physically towered over the extrovert Somerville, but was otherwise lost in his friend’s shadow.

Friction grew, and it was against this backdrop of drug-fuelled rowing that Coles invented the deception which eventually drove him towards God.

The book details his pain as Aids swept away so many friends in the Eighties; he ascribes his survival to his unattractive physical appearance and crippling shyness, which stopped him taking part in the deadly promiscuity.

During a European tour, Coles fell ill with shingles, one of the tell-tale signs of the HIV condition which leads to Aids. He had a blood test, but before he got the results had an argument with Somerville. It ended when Coles blurted what he thought to be true at the time: ‘Look, I’m HIV positive.’

In fact the blood test came back negative. But by then Coles admits he had come to like the horrible fiction he had created. In one interview this week he said: ‘Saying it got me sympathy, which I liked.’

But he told another interviewer: ‘The harder part to admit was that there was a dark glamour to being HIV positive, there was this drama and I was drawn to that.’

The lie carried on for an astonishing five years, during which time he says he was ‘too ashamed. I felt like such an idiot’.

Memoir: The Rev Coles' book about his past

It was only after he had found God in 1990 that he mustered the courage to tell people he had been an HIV fraud. His Damascene moment came in a Mass at a central London church: ‘I was pierced to the soul at that moment . . . a shutter was flung open, and light flooded in and I could see.’

But telling those close to him about his big lie inevitably had unpleasant consequences: his oldest friend never spoke to him again.

‘It was so humiliating,’ Coles says. ‘But maybe that wasn’t such a bad thing; to be knocked off your pedestal is salutary . . . Now it means I am deeply concerned with being as honest as possible.’

He said the HIV/Aids crisis and his own lie about it played a part in his conversion to Christianity. He saw the ‘devoted, patient care’ of Aids patients by Christians.

But he also recognised his own failings: ‘Shame was one of the drivers that brought me to God, because I needed to be forgiven [for] selfishness, silliness, wildness, taking s***loads of drugs, being irresponsible. And lying about being HIV positive.’

Inspired by his new-found faith, Coles took a theology degree at King’s College, London, before returning to his home county where he began to seriously consider taking holy orders.

Around this time occurred the events which, as recounted in his autobiography, will perhaps jar most with the traditional wing of his church and some of his parishioners.

Having eschewed much of the available gay sex as a conflicted pop star in the Eighties, Coles threw himself into a succession of casual public sexual encounters — now known as ‘dogging’ — as a born-again Christian in the late Nineties.

He explained to one interviewer who met him at his home in Finedon: ‘In the love of Jesus Christ I discovered I was not so loathsome nor so special as I thought I was.’

In fact he had also discovered a layby on a busy road with a wood on either side. ‘This place where men could meet other men and have sex. I can’t say where it is because it’s not far from here.’

The location offered, he says, ‘the perfect infrastructure for late-night debauchery’. What occurred there was ‘one of the great liberations of my life. Having lots of casual and anonymous sex with strangers.’

In another interview he explained further: ‘I was very much healed by the experience of anonymous sex with strangers in lay-bys. There were moments of profound intimacy with people who were dying to be intimate. Dying for it — just being close and being able to be vulnerable and express longing.’

He has admitted this wasn’t consistent with his growing Christian calling, but he wouldn’t repudiate having behaved the way he did then, saying simply: ‘I had a fantastic time.’

In 2005, he was ordained into the Anglican priesthood, and now lives a celibate life, albeit in civil partnership with David Oldham, a 37-year-old curate in a neighbouring parish. They met when Oldham went to hear Coles preach in Norwich seven years ago.

Church of England rules dictating the celibacy of ministers in civil partnership coincided with their own sex life ‘fading away’. They sleep side by side and kiss, but only chastely.

Coles says there is ‘nothing creditable in the Church of England’s position on gay relationships . . . the Church should repent of its hostility to homosexual people and beg forgiveness for its treatment of the gay community’.

In the meantime, he might have to rely upon the tolerance, if not forgiveness, of his bishop.

Coles is ready to be unrepentant: ‘Sex in lay-bys and telling a lie about being HIV might be too fruity for the Church of England,’ he has said. ‘But I’m not going to apologise for telling the truth.’

One awaits with interest the views of Finedon Mother’s Union.
