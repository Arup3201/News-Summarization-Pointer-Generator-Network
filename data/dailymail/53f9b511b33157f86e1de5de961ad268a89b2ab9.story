Next week's British Grand Prix will be the 50th held at Silverstone.

To mark the occasion, Murray Walker - the voice of Formula One - looks back at his 10 favourite races there...

1948 - It was the first Grand Prix we had since the war and there was a feeling of euphoria. The foreign superstars, who we hadn’t really seen before in Britain, were out in force. Luigi Villoresi won for Maserati and team-mate Alberto Ascari was second. There was a crowd of over 120,000 people, despite the fact that it took hours to get in and out of the circuit.

1949 - This race was special for me because it was the first broadcast I ever did. I was at Stowe Corner when John Bolster (second right), in an ERA, came down the track, lost control, went barrelling end over end and was thrown in heap at my feet in the commentary box. I thought: ‘God, what do I say?’ I said: ‘Bolster has gone off’ — a masterpiece of understatement.

1950 - It was the inaugural Formula One Grand Prix, and it also the 
first, and so far only, Royal meeting. King George VI (far left), 
Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret attended. It was also noticeable 
because the Italian Alfa Romeo team were there in force. They entered 
four cars and finished first, second and third.

1951 - Alfa Romeo, who were as dominant then as Mercedes are this year,
 were beaten at a world championship Grand Prix for the first time by 
Ferrari. It also marked the first time the Italian team had tasted 
victory in F1. The race was won by a chap called Jose Froilan Gonzalez 
(above). Juan Fangio of Alfa Romeo was second and Ferrari’s Gigi 
Villoresi came third.

1960 - Graham Hill started second on the grid next to pole-sitter Jack Brabham, but he stalled his car and was 22nd by the end of the first lap. Incredibly, Hill fought his way back through the field and led the race on lap 55 with only 22 to go. He was pressed all the way by Brabham and spun off six laps before the end, with the Australian winning.

1969 - Great friends Jackie Stewart and Jochen Rindt battled side-by-side for 63 of the 84 laps. Stewart saw the rear wing end plate of Rindt’s Lotus was loose and in danger of cutting his tyre, which would have taken him off at enormous speed. Stewart gestured to Rindt and the Austrian pulled into the pits with the Scot taking victory.

1973 - Jody Scheckter, in his McLaren, started from fourth, but lost control and took out nine cars on the first lap. He’d wiped out the whole of John Surtees’ team and he had to go and hide! Surtees, who is not the best man in the world to cross, was very, very angry. Scheckter finished fourth when the race re-started . . . and Surtees never found him!

1987 - Nigel Mansell (right) had terrific vibrations on his car and had to change all four wheels, leaving his Williams team-mate Nelson Piquet to streak away. Nigel was 28 seconds behind Piquet, in an identical car, with 30 laps to go. But Nigel drove out of his skin and, with three laps remaining, he threw Piquet a dummy at Stowe, passed him, and won the race.

Hard-fought victory: Damon Hill, driving for Williams Renault, fought off Michael Schumacher to win in 1994

1994 - There was so much controversy that year, starting at Silverstone. Michael Schumacher (near right) illegally passed championship rival Damon Hill on the parade lap. The start was aborted but the German did it again. Schumacher was later black-flagged but he ignored it. Hill won, but Schumacher was banned for two races.

2008 - Lewis Hamilton in the McLaren turned in an absolutely brilliant drive in appalling weather conditions. It was terribly wet and while the rest of the field were spinning off, Hamilton won the race by a whopping 67 seconds - light years in Formula One.
