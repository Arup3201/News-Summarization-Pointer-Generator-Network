The notorious Kray brothers terrorised the East End of London during the 1950s and 60s. The Firm, as their brutal gang was known, was responsible for countless violent assaults, armed robberies, running protection rackets and for the murders of Jack 'the hat' McVitie and George Cornell.

And now intimate diary entries penned by the the tragic wife of Reggie Kray reveal that his reign of terror knew no bounds, and was just as fierce in his home life as he was within his underground world of crime.

In her private scribblings Frances Kray, who first met Reggie when she was just 16, describes her hellish life with the 
gangster and having to share a bed with a gun and a flick-knife.

Her marriage to Reggie lasted only eight weeks but she wrote of the abuse and drunken temper bouts she endured at the hands of the East End villain.

Describing
 how Reggie kept a cache of deadly weapons in their bedroom, she said, 
'He came back night time. By the side of bed gun, sword, knife, chopper,
 flick-knife.'

'He used to sleep with flick-knife under his pillow,' she added.

He later took to keeping a loaded rifle by his bed after making sure every door and window of their home was locked, the journal reveals.

The diary records how Reggie, who died in 2000, often told Frances to ‘shut your mouth’ and that he would warn her he'd ‘make her suffer’ and torment her suggesting he was having affairs with club hostesses.

Happier times: A letter from Reggie to Frances when he was in Wandsworth prison in 1960, which begins 'My Dearest Darling Frankie...'

Reggie's letter to Frances from Wandsworth prison, which ends, 'Well my darling that's all for now...' along with romantic words of a song, 'I love you more than ever, And yearn for the time we are together'

Frances also wrote of how much time the notorious gangster spent at his mother’s house, where his hardman twin brother Ronnie walked around in his underwear.

Desperate Frances kept the log while she sought a way out of her unhappy marriage with Reggie.

Tragically, she eventually committed suicide by taking a fatal drug overdose in 1967.

Her five page diary along with over 60 letters that Reggie wrote to her while he was in prison before they were married are now being sold in auction by a direct descendant of her family.

The
 letters show a Jeckyll and Hyde side to Reggie’s personality, as he 
comes across as loving and affectionate in some and bitter and spiteful 
in others.

In one letter he wrote in August 1960, the mobster calls his then girlfriend a ‘spiteful little tormentor’ and says she was ‘humiliating’ him in front of other inmates after she told him she had been out dancing.

There are also numerous black and white photos of the couple, some of them previously unseen, that are being sold by auctioneers Gorringes of Lewes, East Sussex.

The overall pre-sale estimate for the items, which are going up for auction tomorrow, is £4,000.

Jane Anderson, a spokesperson from the auction house, said, 'This archive is coming from the estate of Frances Kray.

'Reggie met Frances when she was 16. At first they were pen pals while he was in Wandsworth Prison and the letters were very chatty and friendly.

'The second batch is from after they were engaged and the tone is completely different, often berating her for not writing enough letters.

'They had an unhappy marriage and it appears that someone told Frances to write down incidents while she was trying to divorce Reggie.

A diary written by Frances Kray about her life with Reggie (pictured above on their wedding day) has recently comes to light and tells an unhappy tale of their relationship

'It seems life with him was impossible. She spent most of her time alone in their flat and when he was there he was often drunk and he slept in a bed with various weaponry.

'When he was in prison it was safe for her to have a relationship with him. But on the outside, she was way out of her depth and was very frightened of Reggie, as anyone would have been.

'Considering what happened to Frances, it is a very poignant archive.

A diary kept by the tragic wife of Reggie Kray describing her hellish 
life with the gangster has emerged

The heart-wrenching diary of Frances Kray describes a terrifying life with gangster Reggie here

'When she died she was buried in the Kray family plot. She had tried to change her name back to her maiden name of Shea and her family tried to get her grave moved from the plot but they didn’t succeed.

In her diary, Frances described her lonely life at their flat in London’s Marble Arch where she lived when she was 25.

'Always drunk and slurring and falling all over the place', reads one of Frances's extracts

Her entries are written in abbreviated form, but tell a harrowing story.

She wrote: 'Reggie came in late every night drunk. Got up every morning, two minutes to dress, left me all day, came back late at night drunk.

'Went to his house - his brother walked in bedroom in underwear, swore at me.

'Went back to flat Marble Arch, came back night time.

'By the side of the bed -- gun, sword, knife, chopper, flick-knife. He used to sleep with flick-knife under his pillow.

'I phoned my brother up to get me out of this place and said something about guns. His brother swore at me and started collecting all the guns in a laundry bag.'

She goes on to say how the Krays called a friend at a nearby pub who came and took the weapons away in fear the police had been called.

She went on to write, 'I said something about me looking for a new flat. He said "shut your mouth".'

Frances was then admitted to hospital ‘for some rest’. She wrote, 'Him and his friend took me to the hospital, he was swearing and shouting at me in the car.'

She went on: 'Couldn’t stand it anymore - left him. When I was packing my suitcases to leave he told me he would bring up fictitious characters against me.'

Summing up his behaviour, she adds: 'Always drunk - slurring and falling all over the place.'
