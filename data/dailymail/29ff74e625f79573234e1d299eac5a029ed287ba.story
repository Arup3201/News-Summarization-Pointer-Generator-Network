This cook has taken his love of bugs to the kitchen table, using insects to add crunch to his recipes.

Channelling Heston Blumenthal’s argument that cooking with insects can be delicious and sustainable, David George Gordon has created an entire recipe book using creepy crawlies.

The Eat-a-Bug Cookbook includes dishes such as curried termite stew, three bee salad and fried green tomato hornworms.

Cuisine de creepy-crawly: David George Gordon has created an entire cookbook using insects after bugs became a staple part of his diet

Mr Gordon, 63, started cooking with bugs in 1997 after researching cockroaches for a book about the pest.

During his research, Mr Gordon came across numerous articles about the benefits of including insects in food and medicine.

Inspired, the lecturer and author from Seattle, Washington decided to write a bug-orientated cookbook instead.

Now bugs have become a staple part of his diet.

He said: ‘People are either repulsed or intrigued - there's not a lot of middle ground.

‘They are usually impressed or at least relieved when they try my dishes. I've actually had people come back for seconds, thirds and in one case fifths for my crickets and orzo pasta dish.

‘Insects contain large amounts of protein plus vitamins, minerals and amino acids - the so-called building blocks of life.

Welcomes insects: Celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal has also predicted that in time insects will be found on sale in supermarkets

‘Broadening our diets to include 
things other than chicken, beef or pork would take the pressure off the 
planet. When you compare bugs to how much it costs to raise a steer 
you'd be shocked.’

Mr 
Gordon reckons that one day eating insects will be as accepted as eating
 other meats - especially if we continue the trend of overfishing the 
world's oceans.

He said: ‘It will be a while in countries like the US or UK though because we have such a negative view of insects to begin with.

‘But then again, we probably weren't very interested in eating raw fish a century ago. Now you can spend your entire paycheck at a sushi bar.’

Experimental celebrity chef Blumenthal also predicts that insects will one day be found on sale in our supermarket aisles.

According to Yahoo! Lifestyle, he said: ‘As long as we can’t see where it comes from, we’ve got no problem eating a prawn. But what about a grasshopper or a cricket? Think about where they live – their conditions are going to be a lot cleaner than a prawn farm.’

On his television program, Blumenthal has cooked wood lice on toast and fried grasshoppers and crickets.
