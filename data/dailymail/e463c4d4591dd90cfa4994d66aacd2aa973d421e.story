A Southern Californian man thrown off a Caribbean gay cruise earlier this week has said that that he and his partner were taunted, humiliated and subjected to inhumane treatment when they were arrested for indecent exposure.

Dennis Jay Mayer, 53, of Palm Springs said he has no doubt they were arrested in Dominica because they were gay. 

Police said it was because they were seen having sex in public on the balcony of their ship cabin. Mayer said they were not having sex, but were ‘partially clothed’.

‘The total experience was horrendous,’ he said. ‘They told us that they did not like us, that they did not like gay people.’

Mayer, a retired deputy sheriff, told how he and his partner of 17 years, John Robert Hart, 41, were summoned to speak to the captain wished to speak to us. ‘We were caught off guard,’ he added.

Three cruise ship officials and six Dominica police officers were waiting for them. After police interviewed both men separately, the assistant captain spoke, Mayer said.

‘At this time, we are going to eject you from the ship. We have zero tolerance toward your behavior,’ Mayer recalled him saying.

Police drove them to their headquarters, where they sat on a bench for nearly two hours without legal representation despite repeated requests, Mayer said.

After police took pictures and obtained fingerprints, a high-ranking officer began a nearly four-hour interrogation. ‘He said: “You're being arrested for being gay. We're arresting you for the crime of buggery”,’ Mayer said. 

‘He said that other people said that we were engaging in homosexual sex. He repeated that several times. I told him I didn't know why they would say that. I wasn't doing that.’

During the interrogation, the police official threatened to take them to a clinic and have them medically examined for proof of homosexual activity, Mayer said.

‘He said, you know, we're looking for specific things, fluids, bruising, things of that nature,’ Mayer said.After making the threat, the official left the room, then came back saying they had a right to refuse the test, Mayer said.

The two men were charged with indecent exposure and put in a five-by-eight-foot cell to await an appearance before a magistrate.

‘The treatment was inhumane,’ Mayer said. ‘We were detained for approximately 26 hours, and 19 of those locked in a cement cell, which had no running water, no toilet, no lights. ‘It stunk of feces and urine. It was infested with cockroaches, ants and bugs.’

Mayer said police brought in government officials to look at them. ‘They paraded many people by to look in on us as if we were some type of animal, which was quite humiliating,’ he said. ‘People got great joy in the pleasure of taunting us.’

On Thursday morning, police drove them to the courthouse in the capital of Roseau, passing through an angry crowd, Mayer said.

‘They were chanting and banging on the police vehicle. They were screaming things,’ he said. 

‘I've never seen anything like this in my life, other than in movies. Both my partner and I really feared for our safety.’

Police drove around the block twice to avoid the crowd and journalists. Officers formed a barricade with their bodies and urged Mayer and his partner to run into the courthouse and not stop. ‘It was very frightening,’ Mayer said.

Once in the courtroom, Chief Magistrate Evaline Baptiste ordered the men to pay a nearly $900 fine after they pleaded guilty to indecent exposure. He called the two men ‘rogues and vagabonds’.

Police then drove them to the airport, Mayer said. He added he would never return to Dominica. ‘I would not spend my money in a country that does not support gay behavior,’ he said. ‘Shame on us for not doing our research.’

The two initially were arrested on suspicion of the local equivalent of sodomy in the eastern Caribbean island, which prohibits sex between two men.

The couple's attorney, Bernadette Lambert, said they were remorseful.

'They were struck by the beautiful mountains, the clean and clear fresh air and were having a few cocktails, and so threw caution to the wind,' she told the court.

Party boat: The cruise was organized by Atlantis Events, a Southern California company that specializes in gay travel. The ship departed for St. Barts without the men, who are being held in a cell at police headquarters in the capital of Roseau

The two were aboard the Celebrity Summit cruise ship that had departed Puerto Rico on Saturday with about 2,000 passengers. The ship departed for St Barts late Wednesday, leaving the men behind.

The cruise was organized by Atlantis Events, a Southern California company that specializes in gay travel.

President
Rich Campbell said Thursday that the outcome of the case would have 
been the same had it involved a heterosexual couple instead of two gay 
men.

'It had nothing to
do with their sexual orientation and everything to do with their public
conduct,' he said. 'I have been in contact with the guests and they are
in good spirits.'

Dozens of islanders packed the courtroom in the capital of Roseau to attend the 30-minute hearing.

Dominica
Tourism Minister Ian Douglas said that tourists should abide by local 
laws regardless of their religious or sexual orientation, and that 
cruise ship officials should make passengers aware of these laws.

'It
cannot be the responsibility of Dominica to screen guests and tourists 
before they come into the country,' he said. 'It is expected that any 
time people come to a country, they will respect the laws of the 
country.'

Gay Caribbean 
cruises have been popular for several years despite hostility to 
homosexuality on certain islands, especially in Jamaica, Barbados and 
the Cayman Islands.

Campbell said in a phone interview earlier that the company has organized many trips to Dominica and would 'happily return'.

'Many countries and municipalities that gay men visit and live in have antiquated laws on their books,' he said.

'These statutes don't pose a concern to us in planning a tourist visit.'

'The guests' actions were unfortunate but minor in this case and have no bearing on our overall guest experience,' he said via email.

The pastor of Dominica's Trinity Baptist Church, Randy Rodney, praised the police for their intervention.

'I
am very pleased that the police were called in and have arrested the 
people in question. I have warned about gay tourism and its implications
for Dominica,' said Mr Rodney, who is a vocal critic of homosexuality 
and lesbianism.

Holiday ethos: On the company website, guest are encouraged to enjoy themselves and it states 'The only rule is there are no rules'

According to Cruisemates.com, no gay cruise lines sail to Jamaica or Barbados for fear of homophobia and possible violence.

It said other places like the U.S. Virgin Islands welcome gay cruises.

In 2010, the Cayman Islands rejected the arrival of an Atlantis gay cruise amid protests from religious groups even though homosexuality is legal on the archipelago.

Don Weiner, a spokesman for Atlantic Events, referred all questions to Campbell, including why the company organized a trip to Dominica and whether it knew about the island's anti-sodomy laws.

Elizabeth Jakeway, a spokeswoman for Celebrity Cruises, referred all questions to Atlantis.

The last time authorities in the Caribbean intervened on a gay cruise was in February 2011, when agents with U.S. Customs and Border Protection arrested a California man aboard the Allure of the Seas, which had docked in St. Thomas.

The man, Steven Barry Krumholz of West Hollywood, pleaded guilty to selling ecstasy, methamphetamine and ketamine to fellow passengers.
