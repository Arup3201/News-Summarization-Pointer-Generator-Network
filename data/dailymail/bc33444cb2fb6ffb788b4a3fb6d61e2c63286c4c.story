That was the first death associated with the fight against IS. But Pentagon officials say that Marine isn't on the Defense Department's public list of deaths because the official paperwork hasn't been completed.

The United States' current combat against the Islamic State has primarily focused on air strikes. But some U.S. troops are on the ground advising the Iraqi military.
