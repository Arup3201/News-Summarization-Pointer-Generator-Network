In the words of one punter, 'Australia needs to get a better national dish'.

Organisers of the 2015 Asian Cup put together a collage of each competitor's national meal of choice as part of its promotional efforts this month.  

Many of them were exotic dishes, such as Oman's Shuwa, Korean Naengmyeon and Saudi Kabsa - but Australia's was a meat pie with a squeeze of tomato sauce, bemusing many punters.

'What an embarrassment next to all these dishes,' punter Ben Jones wrote. 'Least pick an actual dish, not something you heat out the freezer'. 

Powered by meat pies? Asian Cup organisers described the meat pie as Australia's national dish

'Should have been medium rare chicken parma!' said another fan, Vince Pham, referring to a chicken parmagiana - a dish which features cheese and tomato cooked onto a chicken schnitzel. 

'All of these delicious looking meals and then Australia gets a meat pie?' questioned Kahlee Anderson.

Others embraced the decision as a celebration of Australiana. 'We like football, meat pies, kangaroos and Holden cars,' said Mike Curran.

AFC cup organisers even felt it needed to describe the composition of a meat pie, writing that it is a 'pie with a filling of meat and/or other savoury ingredients'. 

Japan: Star player Keisuke Honda's national dish was sushi

Saudi Arabia: Nasser Al-Shamrani's national dish was kabsa, a type of spiced chicken

Oman: Ali Al-Habsi's national dish was suwah, a lamb-based dish

Statistics, however, show the AFC may have done its research.

Each Australian eats an average of 12 meat pies a year, according to Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) .

That means the nation consumes some 270 million pies each year.

Just last week, the Cup was criticised for leaving the entire continent of Australia off its map of Asia (although, the map has not been changed since Australia joined the competition in 2001.

The tournament begins in Melbourne on January 9.
