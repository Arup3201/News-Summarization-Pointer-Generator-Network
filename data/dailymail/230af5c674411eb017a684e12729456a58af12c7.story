Building a house from scratch, even a tiny one, is not for the faint of heart, but 14-year-old Sicily Kolbeck has proven she has what it takes to see her passion project through against overwhelming odds.

Kolbeck, from Marietta, Georgia, started work on her diminutive dwelling, lovingly dubbed La Petite Maison, when she was 12.

At the time, the girl was searching for an outside-the-box idea for a school project when she stumbled upon a sizable online community of DIY builders specializing in downsized homes.

Labor of love: Sicily started work on her building project with her father when she was 12, but took a break after her dad's untimely passing last February

Sicily had no construction experience beyond re-purposing a large TV box as a playhouse for herself, but her father, Dane, volunteered to help, CNN reported.

Her mother, Suzannah Kolbeck, who was also her teacher and the founder of her school, signed up as Sicily's project manager, but the girl was to act as the chief architect, builder and fundraiser on the project.

Sicily got the project off the ground by launching an online fundraising campaign in January 2013. Within less than a month, the middle-schooler reached - and then exceeded - her $1,500 goal.

'My decision to build a tiny house was partly economic, partly the desire to be free,' Sicily Kolbeck wrote in the description.

'Building a tiny house can give me stability, possibly for the rest of my life if I build the house well.

'Building a house would give me the life skills that really matter, such as using tools for construction. Building the house I can know what labors go into a home and truly appreciate what I am living in.'

Around the same time, Sicily launched the blog La Petite Maison to offer updates on her progress.

The 
12-year-old and her father, a sailor and woodworking enthusiast, got 
down to work, drawing blueprints for her future dwelling and erecting 
a birdhouse and scale models for practice.

After
 some initial growing pains, the father-and-team team got the hang of 
working together, with Dane Kolbeck learning how to restrain himself and
 allow his daughter to do it her way.

On
 her part, the plucky 12-year-old quickly picked up the construction 
jargon from her dad and learned how to safely use his power tools.

Then on February 16, everything ground to a halt: Sicily’s father was killed in a car accident.

As
 her mother wrote on her daughter's blog two months later, Dane's 
untimely passing caused Sicily to lose interest in the project.

But under the guidance of her father's long-time friend and professional homebuilder, Luke Bair, Sicily once again immersed herself into her work on the tiny house, which now took on a deeper meaning for the grieving middle-schooler. 

The family and their friends made their way to a local Home Depot for supplies, revamped the blueprints and picked up where Sicily and Dane left off all these months ago.

Not before long, Sicily and her mother were overwhelmed with support from loved ones and neighbors who would stop by the house to lend a hand with the myriad of tasks that go into building a house.

But Dane Kolbeck's passing left a profound mark on Sicily: she was sullen and distracted in school, no longer as engaged in softball as before and lacking zest for life.

To get away from it all, Suzannah and Sicily went on a five-week road trip, staying with friends in the mid-Atlantic region and enjoying long drives, just the two of them.

When they returned home in time for the start of a new school semester, Sicily made up her mind to finish what she and her dad had started.

This time, however, the now-13-year-old aspiring builder appealed to the boarder community, from other tiny-home aficionados on Facebook to experts and friends eager to pitch in.

Many people volunteered their time, among them a roofer who put a top on Sicily’s humble abode free of charge; a retiree who instructed her in the art of wiring the house, and other homebuilders who showed Sicily how to plumb her kitchen and bathroom.

What started as a school project over time blossomed into a 128-square-foot labor of love, as well as a tribute to Sicily’s father.

Despite her tender age, Sicily Kolbeck showed everyone that she was dedicated to the project and determined to see it to completion, putting in long hours, navigating challenges and problem-solving on the fly like a seasoned pro.

‘It wasn't until later ... probably these past couple months that I realized why I'm doing this,’ Sicily said. ‘I'm doing it to show him that I can do stuff, to show him that I am capable and he doesn't need to yell at me when I can't use the drill.’

Last December, Sicily traveled to New Orleans to give a speech at a TEDYouth conference, talking to other teens about the joys and challenges of tiny-home construction - and healing.

Around the same time, she was asked to pen a first-person account about her experiences for the Huffington Post.

‘Sometimes when people get a hard knock, they stay down. I didn't. That's my claim to fame,’ she wrote. ‘I also wanted to show that when I was handed lemons, I not only made lemonade. I made a lemon cake. And I ate it. And it was delicious.’

Last month, Sicily announced on her blog that her wooden masterpiece boasting a bedroom, fully functioning kitchen and bathroom, a closet and storage cubbyholes, was finally finished.

From start to finish, it took Sicily and her many helpers a year-and-a-half of labor and $10,000 to get the job done.

The charming little bungalow painted royal blue with a white trim for now sits in the Kolbecks' backyard in Marietta.

When the family move to Baltimore this summer, Sicily’s house will travel with them.

The girl, now 14 years old, is already thinking of her next makeover project: rebuilding a rickety, old Volkswagen Beetle.
