A 'quiet pint' at the local pub turned into a 7,000-mile trip to Thailand for two British men – armed with just a Tesco carrier bag containing some clothes.

Company director Phillip Boyle, 33, had decided to go for a beer at the Southern Cross pub in Middlesbrough with friends for a relaxing Friday night.

But one turned to two and then three and more - and at 1am Mr Boyle, along with friend Jamie Blyth, 33, decided to go home. However, their decision soon led them halfway around the world.

After leaving the pub they stopped off for some more beers from the petrol station along the way.

It was back at Mr Boyle's house where the two, in their drunken stupor, decided to book a taxi to Manchester Airport in the morning and fly to Thailand.

Mr Boyle said: 'After lots of jokes, at around 11am the next day with a hangover, Jamie asks if I had my passport handy and came up with the idea of us going to Thailand straight away.

The pair flew from Manchester Airport to Pattaya, Thailand with a stopover in Abu Dhabi

'I thought he was joking at first and then he pointed out how there are quite a few lads from Middlesbrough over there we hadn't seen for a while.

'Then we got into a taxi he'd phoned and - apart from the short delay of picking up Jamie's passport - we were off to Manchester Airport. When we got in the taxi we didn't even have flights.

'It's a last minute bad idea - but one of those bad ideas that turns into a good idea.'

Mr Boyle revealed that while battling a hangover, he managed to pack a Tesco carrier bag with some boxer shorts and a few T-shirts.

The journey to the airport saw Mr Boyle come close to cancelling as the alcohol started to wear off, but once they arrived at Manchester, the pair managed to book flights to the Far East.

The key protagonist may have been rigger Mr Blyth, who was recognised by the taxi driver as having splashed out on these last-minute trips numerous times in the past.

It was then that the taxi driver revealed that it wasn't the first time Mr Blyth had done a similar flit - having used him several times before to make similar last-minute trips.

Mr Boyle said: ‘The taxi driver told me how Jamie had done this same last minute thing four times now, with him being the same driver to take him to Manchester in each case. I thought that was hilarious and then said “OK, I'm in”.’

Flights from Manchester to Pattaya were secured. With a stopover in Abu Dhabi it amounted to two seven-hour trips.

'Some of the lads have serious girlfriends and kids and it's been pretty intense for some of them,' added Mr Boyle.

'I wouldn't like to be facing the grief that some of them will be inevitably going home to.

'But no-one's misbehaved to be fair. I think it's a place where younger lads would perhaps go crazy. I'm single right now - so no consequences to face for me.'

The pair are making their way back to Middlesbrough today.

Mr Boyle added: 'I'd never fancied Thailand before - so going last minute for a few days is perfect. 

'Today we're by the pool and out to complete our version of The Hangover.'
