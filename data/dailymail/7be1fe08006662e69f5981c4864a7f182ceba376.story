One dangerous motorist has taken 'hands free' driving to a new level after being caught not gripping the wheel at around 40mph.

Shocked witness Alan Miller filmed the dangerous driver and even captured the moment she was on the phone with one hand and swearing at him with the other near Rotherham, South Yorkshire.

Last week the driving instructor spotted the woman in his car's mirrors and while an experienced 18-year-old pupil was at the wheel he turned in his chair to quickly film the illegal act.

Caught: The woman is shown clearly on the phone with one hand and swearing with the other at 40 miles per hour

And when she knew she was spotted, instead of gripping the wheel, she just used her other hand to flash the V-sign at him.

'It’s like the threat of three points and a £60 fine isn’t enough of a deterrent for people. Clearly having a phone call is more important to them than safety or the possibility of points on their licence,' he said.

Mr Miller said it is a depressingly common example of unsafe driving he sees, adding that he spots motorists illegally phoning while at the wheel up to six times an hour.

On the phone: The woman was filmed less than a car length away from a learner driver and this is the moment just before she spots she is being filmed breaking the law

'This kind of thing happens all the time, it’s a nightmare. I put it online to embarrass the driver and in the hope that she sees it and thinks twice about doing it again,' he said.

He keeps the small video camera in his dual-controlled car to document the scene of any accidents, but has increasingly begun to use it as a deterrent to motorists.
