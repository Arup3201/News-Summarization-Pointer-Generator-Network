On the run: Lester Jackson hasn't been seen since Monday

Convicted killer Lester Jackson has gone on the run after being let out of prison to clear sand at a seaside resort.

A manhunt has been launched for Jackson, 43, who has not been seen since Monday.

He was allowed out of Kirkham Jail, Lancashire at 8.45am and should have joined a work placement clearing windblown sand at Lytham St Annes.

However, he failed to turn up and has not been seen since.

It
is thought he ran away over sandhills before his work was due to begin.
Police think he may still be in the locality six days on.

The prison is a Category D prison and prisoners are trusted to serve their sentences in open conditions.

Jackson, from London, was jailed for killing a man in a street mugging in London in 1991.

It is thought he could be in the St Annes or Blackpool area or possibly Cumbria, Hertfordshire or London.

A prison spokesman said Jackson would have been given security checks before being allowed to join a work placement.

He is described as white, 43 years of age, 6''1' in height with a slim build and short brown hair and green eyes.

Detective Chief Inspector Brian Quinn. of Blackpool police said: 'I would appeal to anyone who knows where Lester Jackson is to come forward and contact the police immediately.

'I would reassure the public that the relevant authorities carry out 
numerous checks on people prior to them being placed and that we have a 
team of officers searching for Jackson.

'At this stage I do not believe that members of the public are at risk 
but it is important that he is located and returned to custody as soon 
as possible.

'If anyone has any information then I would appeal to them to get in 
touch. Even the smallest details could prove crucial as we try to locate
him.'
