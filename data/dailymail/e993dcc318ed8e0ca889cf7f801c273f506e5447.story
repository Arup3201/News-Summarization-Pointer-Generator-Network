Miley Cyrus took her controversial antics to new highs on Sunday night when she appeared to smoke a joint on stage at the MTV awards while wearing a dangerously high-cut sheer leotard. 

The former Hannah Montana star lit a rolled cigarette onstage in Amsterdam's Ziggo Dome - a controversial move which was hastily edited out when her performance was broadcast in the U.S.

The 20-year-old singer made sure she stood out from a bevvy of scantily-clad celebrities at the event by taking to the stage in a latex white leotard cut so dangerously high that it left little to the imagination.

Lighting up: Miley smoked a suspicious looking cigarette on stage

When she picked up the award for Best 
Video for her track Wrecking Ball, Miley grinned as she attempted to 
shove the award into her vintage $2,150 Chanel bag, before
pulling out what appeared to be a joint and telling the audience: 'I 
can't fit it in my bag... but I did find this!'

The act was deemed so controversial by MTV bosses that it was edited out of the show when it was aired in the U.S. Instead, the show featured only a brief shot of Miley accepting her award and thanking her fans.

However a 35-second clip of Miley lighting up later appeared on YouTube, giving American fans a chance to see the 
controversial moment. MailOnline was awaiting a comment from MTV on the singer's controversial move. 

The Parents Television Council praised MTV for editing out the apparent drug use.

In a comment to MailOnline, PTC President Tim Winter said: 'Last night MTV made a responsible decision and they executed it perfectly.

'It is unclear whether MTV’s actions suggest stricter content guidelines for its TV-14 programming, or whether this is just an example of the old saying that ''even a broken clock is right twice each day.''

'We certainly hope it is the former. We applaud MTV for taking responsible actions to eliminate the drug use from its U.S. broadcast, and we urge them to make that a uniform policy for all of its programming.'

Miley's decision to light up on stage also did
little to impress many of her fans, with people taking to Twitter to 
comment on the act.

The scenes of Miley appearing to smoke a joint on stage at the EMA Awards were edited out by MTV when the show aired in the U.S.

'I just found out!' Miley told the audience that she had just happened to find the 'joint' in her bag

One wrote: 'Seriously wtf is wrong with miley cyrus?! Why would you smoke a joint at the ema awards?!'

While another added: 'Haha Miley Cyrus is now smoking weed on live TV. What next?'

Adeline Tan posted: 'So can I just say, Miley Cyrus is a horrible role model, and is utterly disgusting. Smoking weed & pretending to take a dump on stage. #wth'

Miley appeared to respond to her critics on Monday via her official Twitter account. She tweeted: 'sometimes in life you just gotta decide to not give A*.'

Earlier she had posted: 'No vids of performance???' and 'go online and watch what really went down at the EMAs!'

It wasn't only Miley's cigarette choice that caused controversy at the awards.

She made sure she was center of attention again on the red carpet in a backless halter top with pictures of rappers Tupac and Biggie Smalls, the word 'VIOLENCE' running along its hem 
and 'Please Stop' emblazoned across the rear.

The skimpy, cut-out dress was teamed with thigh-high, checkered boots.

Miley opened the ceremony with a space-themed performance of her smash hit, We Can't Stop, while dressed as an astronaut in a skintight silver spacesuit.

The former child star poked her 
tongue out as she twerked alongside a latex-clad female dwarf, before 
groping her dancer's breasts and rubbing her face into her chest.

later changed into a white bodysuit
for a more stripped-back performance of her hit track Wrecking Ball.
