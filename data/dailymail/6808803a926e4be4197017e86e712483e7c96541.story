Outraged: Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he deplored gender segregation

A woman who took to Facebook to vent her disgust after being shoved to the back of a bus in Israel, despite segregation being outlawed more than a year ago, has sparked outrage across the country.

Tanya Rosenblit, 28, from the southern town of Ashdod, boarded a bus to an Orthodox neighborhood in Jerusalem.

Shortly after 
she sat down behind the driver, a man wearing the black garb and flowing
 sidelocks of the ultra-Orthodox boarded the bus and asked her to move.

Since Ms Rosenblit spoke of her treatment she has become a cause celebre in the Israeli media over the weekend.

The case even drew public comment from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and chief rabbis, who said they deplored gender segregation.

Ultra-Orthodox Jews, who make up about 10 per cent of Israel's population of 7.6 million, have become increasingly aggressive in their efforts to impose their norms in public spaces.

The ultra-Orthodox have segregated bus lines and some walkways in their neighbourhoods.

When Ms Rosenblit refused to move, the man then blocked the bus from driving, she told reporters.

Segregation: The practice of splitting men and women up on Israeli buses was outlawed last year but one woman's story has shown some ultra-orthodox Jewish men are still submitted to the practice

She
 held her ground - even after a male police officer dispatched to the 
scene asked her if she was 'willing to respect them and move to the back.'

She said: 'I said, "I respected them enough with my modest dress and I don't plan to humiliate myself to respect them or anyone else."

The man opted to stay in Ashdod rather than travel on the bus with her.

In Jerusalem, billboards depicting women have become a rarity because ultra-Orthodox vandals rip them down.

The issue also has seeped into the military, where religious soldiers walked out of a military event several months ago because women were singing - which extremely devout Jews believe is contrary to Jewish law.

In the past, ultra-Orthodox Jews have confined their strict practices to their own neighbourhoods, alongside occasional attempts to pass restrictive legislation banning sale of pork or opening shops on the Jewish Sabbath.

Political storm: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the issue yesterday saying it was 'unacceptable'

Recently the extremist Jews have been trying to impose their norms outside their own enclaves, but the effects are scattered. Most of Israel's secular majority is not directly affected.

The Supreme Court was forced to wade into the controversy last year, when it ruled on the segregated buses and sidewalks. Although activists say harassment on buses has diminished since the court ruling late last year, some of the fiercely devout are persisting with their efforts to block the mixing of the sexes in public.

Netanyahu spoke out against the attempted segregation at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting.

'Today I heard about moving a woman on a bus. I adamantly oppose this,' Netanyahu said. 'Fringe groups must not be allowed to tear apart our common denominator. We must preserve public space as open and safe for all citizens of Israel.'

Israel's two chief rabbis, themselves ultra-Orthodox Jews, concurred that the religious have no right to impose their opinions on others and proposed private bus lines as a substitute.

'It's not an ultra-Orthodox state,' said Chief Rabbi Yona Metzger, who represents Israel's Ashkenazi, or European-descended Jews.

'A person can subject himself to a stricter code, but not others,' the Ynet news website quoted Chief Rabbi Shlomo Amar, who represents Sephardic Jews of Mideast descent, as saying.
