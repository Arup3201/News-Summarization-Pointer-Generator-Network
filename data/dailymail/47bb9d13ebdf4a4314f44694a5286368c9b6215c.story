Fernando Torres scored in the first minute of each half as Atletico Madrid booked a place in the Copa del Rey quarter finals and ruined Cristiano Ronaldo's Ballon d'Or celebrations.

Back at Atletico on loan after an dreadful spell at Chelsea, the former £50m striker lashed a first-time effort high into the net past goalkeeper Keylor Navas to put Atletico 1-0 ahead on the night and 3-0 up on aggregate.

The 30-year-old, included in the starting lineup in place of an ailing Mario Mandzukic, had never scored against Real at their Bernabeu stadium and, after Sergio Ramos made it 1-1, he restored Atletico's lead with a neat finish just after the interval.

Host commentator

Simeone has pulled off a tactical masterclass at the Santiago Bernabeu. Torres' double proved to be significant as Atletico progress to the quarter-finals of the Copa del Rey. Ramos and Ronaldo struck for the home side but they were unable to find a further three goals. Attention now turns to Barcelona's clash against Elche.

Atletico Madrid are starting to control possession now. Real look extremely despondent. 

Not exactly a brave prediction but it does not look like Real are going to be able to pull the three-goal deficit (due to Atletico's away goals) back. They appear to have run out of steam with just under 10 minutes left on the clock.

Ancelotti will have been extremely disappointed with his side's display today. His attacking trio of Ronaldo, Bale and Benzema have failed to impress this evening. 

Just to remind you, Real need three goals in under 20 minutes if they are to progress to the next round of the Copa del Rey. The winners are likely to face Barcelona, who lead Elche 5-0 from the first leg. 

Benzema has to do better. The Frenchman blasts the ball over the bar from close range to the delight of Atletico's defender. Surely time for Hernandez to be given a chance.

With 67 minutes gone, Ronaldo - despite scoring Real's second - has hardly had a sniff at goal. The Ballon d'Or winner will be extremely disappointed with how his night is panning out. 

Navas pushes a Griezmann free-kick over the bar. The away side have been able to get further up the pitch during the second half. Simeone's tactics have been spot on so far.

Torres has been denied the chance of grabbing a hat-trick. Simeone has decided to replace his January signing with Turan. The former Chelsea striker was a staggering 250/1 to score a hat-trick before the match. 

This tie is just getting better and better. Bale crosses the ball to Ronaldo, who heads the ball past Oblak. 2-2 with 55 minutes on the clock.

Torres worms his way into the box before the ball falls to Griezmann, whose deflected shot goes just wide. 

Sportsmail's Pete Jenson: 'Oh my, 37 seconds this time. Torres has silenced the Bernabeu. "Fer-nan-do Torres!" sing Atletico Madrid's 500 supporters.'

Real Madrid obviously didn't learn from Torres' opener as the former Chelsea forward has scored a similar goal to his first. He links up with Griezmann again before slotting the ball under Navas' legs. 

Ancelotti does not have many attacking options on the subs' bench. He will surely turn to Hernandez during the second half.. Real's bench: Casillas, Varane, Coentrao, Khedira, Hernandez, Jese, Illarramendi

Simeone will be delighted with the scoreline at half-time despite the fact his side have been camped inside their own half during the first half. Torres opened the scoring inside the first minute before Ramos pulled a goal back 19 minutes later.

Real Madrid appeal for a penalty as Ronaldo's shot at goal appears to hit Miranda's arm. However referee Antonio Miguel Mateu Lahoz  waves play on. It would have been extremely harsh on the Atletico defender.

Karim Benzema has been extremely quiet during the first half. Ancelotti may decide to throw on Javier Hernandez after the interval.

Atletico are finding it hard to get on the ball. The away side are hoping to hit Real on the counter attack, as they did with the first goal, but Real are not relinquishing possession. 

Real Madrid are still looking for a second goal. Ancelotti cannot fault the passion and effort of his players despite the early goal by Torres. 10 minutes to go until the interval.

Atletico are doing everything they can to stop Real from going in front before the interval. They are finding it hard to get out of their own half due to the home side's eagerness to reduce the 3-1 deficit. 

Bale stretches his legs by bursting down the right at pace before picking out Ronaldo. However the Real Madrid man's effort at goal is deflected wide by Juanfran.

Ramos has now scored six goals this season. A pretty good record for a central defender. 

Ramos really is a threat from set-pieces. He showed outstanding technique to head past Oblak.

Ronaldo almost put his side in the lead, however his shot was cleared off the line by Mario Suarez. Momentum is building for the home side with 24 minutes gone.

Sportsmail's Pete Jenson: Real Madrid need to repeat Champions League final scored here to go through and there is the first. Ramos from Kroos free-kick after Torres kicked Ronaldo.

Curse of the commentator. Sergio Ramos leaps above Atletico's defence to head past Oblak and level the scoring. Game on! 

Atletico goalkeeper Oblak saves a Ronaldo shot from close range. The Slovenian goalkeeper will have to be at his best if he is to keep a clean sheet. 

17 minutes gone and Real Madrid have not really peppered Oblak's goal. Diego Simeone will be delighted with his side's performance thus far.

Griezmann, who set up the opening goal, appears to have a slight problem with his arm. Looks like he will be able to carry on though.

Torres celebrated his goal in front of the Real fans, who didn't look too happy with the Atletico striker.

Atletico are allowing their rivals to dictate play. The pressure is firmly on the home side after Torres' opener. Nearly 11 minutes gone at the Bernabeu. 

Real Madrid now need to score four goals if they are going to have any chance of progressing to the next round. A big task but anything is possible when you have Ronaldo, Bale and Co.

Real Madrid will have been shell shocked by the speed of Atletico's goal. Torres, on the other hand, will take great confidence from his first goal since September 23.

Fernando Torres has scored his first goal back at his former side inside the first 60 seconds. Griezmann goes on the attack before sliding the ball to Torres, who has the easy tack of placing the ball into an empty net.

Ronaldo is currently on the Santiago Bernabeu turf - displaying his Ballon d'Or award to his home fans. Rodriguez, Ramos and Kroos are also showing off their trophies for being included in the world team of the year.

Sportsmail's Pete Jenson: 'Mandzukic doesn't even make the bench having not recovered from a virus. Big night for Torres. Needs to stretch Real Madrid on the counter-attack as Ancelotti's team go for the big comeback.

'Big cheers as Bale's name is read out - Sunday's booing all forgotten. Ronaldo predictably gets the biggest cheer though.' 

Torres makes his second start since rejoining his boyhood side. It would be an ideal place and time for him to score his first goal back at the club.

Bale's last match at his home ground saw Real fans jeer the Welsh winger for failing to pass the ball to Ronaldo. The former Tottenham star will be hoping to prove the doubters wrong against his side's rivals.

Ronaldo, pictured arriving at the Santiago Bernabeu alongside Marcelo and Rodriguez, will be hoping to show why he was the worthy winner of the Ballon d'Or. The Portuguese superstar beat off competition from Messi and Neuer to win the prestigious award on Monday. 

Sportsmail's Pete Jenson: 'Madrid supporters packing the streets around the stadium as the team coach arrives at the Santiago Bernabeu.

'They need to overhaul a 2-0 first leg deficit against Atletico Madrid. Supporters will hold gold cards aloft before kick-off as Cristiano Ronaldo presents his Ballon d'Or to the home fans.'

Hello and welcome to our live commentary of tonight's Copa del Rey tie between Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid. 

Both sides have named strong teams with the likes of Ronaldo, Bale and Torres all starting at the Santiago Bernabeu.

Cristiano Ronaldo was voted the world's best player on Monday evening and Real Madrid fans will be hoping he shows why when they take on bitter rivals Atletico Madrid. 

Carlo Ancelotti's side trail Atletico 2-0 in their Copa del Rey round of 16, after goals from Raul Garcia and Jose Maria Gimenez's in the first leg.

However, Real have home advantage this time and got back to winning ways against Espanyol last week.
