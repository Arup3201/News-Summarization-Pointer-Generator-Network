Speaker's wife Sally Bercow has pleaded for Celebrity Big Brother winner Paddy Doherty to be spared jail after he admitted affray following a bare-knuckle brawl which police linked to an underworld shooting.

In fresh embarrassment for her husband John Bercow, the 42-year-old described Doherty as 'quite a softie' adding: 'I would very much hope the sentence is suspended'.

Mrs Bercow has a history of leaving her Common's Speaker husband red-faced and just last month revealed her favourite gadget is a sex toy, weeks after openly discussing their 'spicy' sex life on Celebrity Big Brother.

The Speaker's wife Sally Bercow took Doherty to the Houses of Parliament in September. The pair formed an unlikely friendship on Celebrity Big Brother and now she has pleaded for him to be spared jail

Doherty, 52, who was the show's winner, will be sentenced for the offence in the New Year.

He was left bloodied and bruised with part of his ear bitten and 
hanging off after he took on his cousins Johnny and Dougie Joyce in a 
street fight outside a PC World store in Manchester.

The brawl was filmed on a mobile phone 
and uploaded to YouTube and a witness was overheard baying for blood 
shouting: 'Come you dirty Doherty b******, give it to him Johnny, give 
to the dirty tramp, floor the dirty tramp.'

During the video a blood-spattered 
Doherty - who also featured in Channel 4 show My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding - was
seen perched on his toes like a boxer, grunting 'like a bull' and 
holding his fists up to protect himself as he landed in a heap with 
Johnny Joyce.

Doherty admitted 
affray after the brawl and had been expected to give evidence against 
his cousin Johnny, who was accused of causing him grievous bodily harm.

The GBH charges against Johnny Joyce, 21, were dropped. Instead, he and his 23-year-old brother Dougie - who filmed the violence on a
mobile phone - and Doherty were all charged with affray.

Doherty, who has also appeared on Britain’s Deadliest Men, pleaded guilty to the
charge at  Manchester Crown Court last week.

The Joyce brothers finally admitted their part in the fracas - part of an ongoing family feud -  yesterday shortly before their trial was due to begin.

Johnny Joyce admitted affray, while Dougie Joyce’s plea to a lesser public order offence was accepted by the prosecution.

All three men will be sentenced in January and were remanded on bail for reports.

Yesterday's hearing comes as Doherty is 
due to star in 'When Paddy Met Sally' a life swap show on Channel 5 with Mrs Bercow.

Filming began in North Wales last 
month and in the programme viewers will see Mrs Bercow move into a 
mobile home with Doherty for two weeks and experience the life of a 
traveller.

In the second 
week of the challenge, Mrs Bercow was able to set rules and challenges 
for Doherty including a cleaning rota and the task of cooking a meal for
his family.

Doherty's fight in a car park outside PC 
World was the latest round of a bloody feud between him and the 
Joyce brothers which was sparked by a row at a family funeral.

That led to a brawl with Doherty at a 
Salford caravan site in August 2010. A few hours afterwards Johnny Joyce
handed himself into police.

Later that day there was a bungled gangland 
shooting at the home of Johnny’s mother 
Roseanne in Manchester.

Two gunmen were dispatched to fire a shot at the house only to mistakenly blast a neighbour’s car. Last month two men were jailed for firearms offences over the shooting.

In February of this year Johnny Joyce was tried and acquitted of causing grievous boldly harm after claiming he acted in self defence.

Four months later Johnny and Dougie came across Doherty on Great Ancoats street in Manchester while the TV star was out jogging and the Joyce brothers were shopping for a birthday present.

At an earlier hearing, Gareth Hughes,
prosecuting, said of Doherty: 'He saw the two Joyces in a vehicle. It 
was alleged they had been aggressive towards him. He was approached by 
Johnny Joyce and there was a punch by Johnny Joyce.'

The
court heard Joyce had been wearing a ring covering two of his fingers 
and that Doherty received an injury to the left eye requiring stiches.

Mr Hughes added: 'There’s then a 
stand-off, recorded by Douglas Joyce on his mobile phone, a mobile phone
that was seized by the police where we can hear Douglas Joyce 
encouraging his brother.

'The footage then stops but what we 
know happened is that Johnny Joyce the better of Doherty in the fight 
and the top of Paddy Doherty’s ear get bitten almost completely off. The
piece of his ear that remained was connected by a bit of skin and was 
sewn back on.

'Douglas Joyce was actively encouraging his brother, shouting, "Bite him". The footage has already made its way into the public domain and it is understood to already be on YouTube.

'The footage shows that after the initial punch there’s a stand-off, fists raised by both but it doesn’t show the next bit. This was all in the middle of the road at the junction, cars came to a stand-still, they couldn’t get any further.'

Mr Hughes described Doherty’s injuries as being the 'partial amputation of the left ear, requiring stitches, a cut requiring stitches to the left eye and a cut to the top lip'.

Defending the Joyce brothers, Declan Doherty said: 'Mr Paddy Doherty describes himself as a star, who is well known because he has starred on a programme called My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding.

'What he doesn’t mention is that in the past few years he has been on Danny Dyer’s Deadliest Men, where for a full hour Paddy Doherty described to Danny Dyer his 30 or 40 years of his fighting career within the travelling community.

'He’s recorded as saying he what he would do to a man in a fight, saying he would chew him up like chocolate bar. He’s not a stranger to violence or to the crown.

'There’s been a history of trouble between the families. This all started about this time last year when there was an argument at a funeral.

'Paddy Doherty felt he had been disrespected by the younger man at this funeral. He lured him back to his caravan site and assaulted him. Johnny Joyce was acquitted by a jury of his peers within 30 minutes.

'There have been a number of other incidents. I understand that associates of Paddy Doherty have been convicted of firearms offences and there are a number of undocumented incidents over the years. This family received warnings that their lives may be in danger.

'Two brothers were in the city centre at four in the afternoon, a very busy time. They were going to JD Sports to buy their sister a birthday present.

'Paddy Doherty was jogging along and he saw them and started to shout abuse at them and makes his way towards them. He doesn’t need to do that but that’s what he decides to do.

'They got out of the car which they shouldn’t have done. Johnny Joyce said: "We’re not doing this again, getting involved with you again, go away." Douglas was standing between them.

'In the course of this Paddy Doherty gets past Douglas Joyce and gets to Johnny Joyce and slammed him in the car door.

'Johnny Joyce didn’t want to fight and he told Paddy Doherty several times to, "Go away, I want nothing to do with you". '

The lawyer said Doherty hit Joyce 'several times' and that it was a 'fair fight'. He added: 'When Paddy Doherty fell down, Johnny Joyce let him get back up. When Johnny fell down Paddy Doherty was standing over him and Douglas Joyce pulled him off.'

The court heard that the brothers rang the police when they returned home, co-operating with them to give them their mobile phones, where the fight was recorded and their old clothes.

A lawyer who brought the two gunmen jailed over the bungled shooting incident to trial said: 'On the same day of the incident there had been a man called Paddy Doherty who had been subject to an assault by a man called Johnny Joyce.

'Doherty received serious injuries and required hospitalisation. Joyce handed himself in and had been interviewed for the offence and it was on this day he handed himself in.

'He claimed self-defence and he was tried and acquitted. We cannot say how these two became involved except that we say it’s more than a coincidence that on the day Joyce handed himself in this address was targeted.'
