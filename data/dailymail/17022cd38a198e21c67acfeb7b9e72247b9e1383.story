A major increase in free childcare will be unveiled today as the Government steps up its efforts to intervene earlier in children’s lives.

Chancellor George Osborne will use his mini-Budget to double the number of two-year-olds receiving free nursery care, with an additional £380million a year in funding by 2014-15.

The Coalition promised universal nursery education for three and four-year-olds last year.

It also made a pledge to extend this to the most disadvantaged two-year-olds. A Government source said: ‘We’re aiming to close the gaps between young children that are opening up even before they hang up their coats for their first day at school.

‘Currently six out of ten two-year-olds from the poorest families do not experience any formal early education – the participation rate in the wealthiest homes is 72 per cent.’

Other measures expected today include:

Mr Osborne is also expected today to unveil a big squeeze on working tax credits, Gordon Brown’s favoured method of channelling cash to less wealthy families.

Critical observers would say that toddlers should not be in need of any formal nursery provision or childcare and should be in the care of their mothers.

However, ministers believe that the reality of modern living means many  mothers cannot afford not to work.

Iain Duncan Smith, the government’s leading champion of early intervention, argues that the state must intervene earlier to provide parenting support for failing families at the bottom end of society.

The Chancellor also wants to wean families off means tested benefits and concentrate resources on children’s earliest years. 

A source said: ‘This is part of the Government’s approach to child poverty and social mobility, aiming to fundamentally change the prospects of children by focusing on early years service provision as a better way to improve life chances than means tested transfers. 

‘This goes further and offers more help to hard-working families to help boost life chances.’

Parenting support: Iain Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary

Totalling £650million over the next three years, the targeted extra funding will double the number of two-year olds covered to 260,000 – around 40 per cent. Compared with this year, 130,000 more will have access to 15 hours of free education and care a week – up from just 20,000 in 2010.

Earlier this year, Mr Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary, led calls for earlier state intervention in children’s lives to provide parenting support.

He said: ‘A child’s life development score at just 22 months can serve as an accurate predictor of educational outcomes at 26 years’. He also pointed to research which showed that parental interest in their children’s education could increase their chances of moving out of poverty as an adult by 25 percentage points.

He added: ‘Shamefully, this is a story that has hardly changed in the last decade.’

In another move, the Chancellor will dramatically bring forward the year when the state pension age will climb again to 67.

Whitehall sources said an announcement would come as early as next week.

Under Labour’s timetable, the pension age was set to reach 67 between 2034 and 2036. But ministers say Britain’s ageing population and spiralling pension costs mean that is untenable.
