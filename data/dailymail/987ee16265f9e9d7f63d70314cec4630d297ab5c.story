A notoriously anti-immigration aide to Mitt Romney has left the campaign in disgrace after he was accused of threatening to deport his ex-gay lover to Mexico.

The man, only identified as ‘Jose,’ claimed Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu threatened him with deportation if he ever disclosed their three-year relationship, the Phoenix New Times stated in an explosive tell-all.

Babeu denied the allegations at a press conference Saturday, saying that all of the accusations appearing in the alternative weekly newspaper are ‘absolutely false, except to the issues that refer to me as being gay.’

He said the accusations arose to mar his chances of running for congress.

Babeu, 43, who served as the co-chair of Mitt Romney’s Arizona campaign, is seeking the GOP nomination for Arizona’s rural western 4th congressional seat.

The sheriff denied claims he tried to threaten the man with deportation if their past relationship was made public.

Jose’s allegations were first published Friday in The New Times.

An attorney for Jose didn't immediately return messages from MailOnline. She told the Phoenix New Times that Jose felt he was ‘being intimidated, and he was in fear for his life.’

The paper revealed that Jose served as a volunteer on Babeu’s campaign, and is originally from Mexico.

CNN revealed that while the sheriff 
is not halting his congressional campaign, he stepped down from his 
volunteer position with Mr Romney’s campaign.

‘We support the decision,’ Romney campaign spokeswoman Andrew Saul said in a statement to CNN.

Politico
speculates the forced outing may be harmful to Babeu’s campaign in part
because the claim filed by Jose alleges that a man famous for border 
protection and deportation of illegal immigrants himself had a 
relationship with an illegal immigrant.

The news site said his supposed lifestyle choices may be alienating to conservative GOP voters.

Despite the serious allegations, 
Babeu said he will run for congress undeterred. ‘We’re not cutting and 
running,’ he told reporters.’

Politico
notes that speculation about the sheriff’s sexual orientation has been 
alight for weeks, but because of the recent allegation, the Phoenix New 
Times had a much firmer platform with which to run their story.

Babeu said at the conference today his sexual orientation and his private life is out of the public eye. ‘What I do in my personal and private life is my personal and private life with those individuals,’ he said.

While he admitted to having a relationship with Jose, he said at no point did he threaten deportation.

Jose, meanwhile, revealed to the New 
Times that Babeu had a profile on gay dating website adam4adam.com. The 
alleged profile of the sheriff shows him shirtless and in what appear to
be boxers.

The profile has since been blocked.

The congressional district where Babeu 
is seeking election runs from western Arizona through Prescott and south
to take in parts of Pinal County south of Phoenix. Its voters are 
heavily Republican and generally very conservative.

Babeu issued a sweeping denial of any 
wrongdoing in front of his headquarters. The press conference was 
attended by about three dozen high-ranking uniformed deputies, local 
elected officials and citizens.

Babeu, who is not married, said he had been in a relationship with Jose that ended sometime before September.

'The real issue here is the poor 
judgment of a government official, posting those kinds of photos on a 
public website. I think that shows a lack of good 
judgment.'

Jose also ran his campaign website and Twitter account, and Babeu said he began posting derogatory items on the sites after their breakup.

Babeu said he had his lawyer contact Jose and demand that he stop and turn over passwords allowing access to the sites. Babeu said the postings and actions amounted to identity theft but that he chose to deal with the matter privately through his lawyer.

Babeu is taking on an incumbent tea party Republican who switched districts and state Sen. Ron Gould, a conservative from north-western, in Arizona in August's 4th District primary.

Mr Gould said he believed Babeu's 
posting of pictures on what the lawmaker called a 'homosexual hook-up 
website' were a 'Congressman Weiner type of moment.'

'The
real issue here is the poor judgment of a government official, posting 
those kinds of photos on a public website,' Mr Gould said. 'I think that
shows a lack of good judgment.'

He also said he believes Babeu's sexual orientation would hurt him in the district. Mr Gould sponsored Arizona constitutional amendment defining marriage as between one man and one woman, an amendment he said drew extremely strong support in the rural counties he and Babeu seek to represent.

Babeu said he has never defined himself based on his ethnicity or sexual orientation, and he would continue to focus on unemployment and the federal deficit in his campaign.

'What I'm trying to do is (be) as forthright as possible, talking about deeply personal, private matters, and trying to be upfront,' Babeu said. 'The disclosure of that information is something that I feel no American should have to do.'

Babeu acknowledged that he has sent and posted the photos, but said they were personal. When asked if posting such pictures on a public website showed poor judgment for a public official, he reiterated that he believed they were personal.
