Michael Wenham is accused of stabbing prostitute Karolina Nowikiewicz, 25, (pictured) to death in a seemingly unprovoked attack at her flat

A father-of-three who suffered a failed penis enlargement operation arranged to meet a prostitute before knifing her repeatedly in the neck, a court heard today. 

Michael Wenham is accused of stabbing Karolina Nowikiewicz, 25, to death in a seemingly unprovoked attack at her flat in Slough, Berkshire, before lying her face-down on her bed, showering himself clean and calling the police.

Reading Crown Court was told that at the time of Ms Nowikiewicz's death on February 17 last year, married Wenham, 35, was recovering from unsuccessful surgery on his genitals, carried out in the U.S. in late 2013.

The jury was told that Wenham still had a dressing on his penis which had affected his sex life with wife of eight years Dawn and that he was self-conscious about the size of his genitalia.

On the day of the killing, Wenham bought a pay-as-you-go mobile phone from an Argos store and tried to use it to arrange a meeting with a prostitute, the court heard.

The IT contractor had also called in sick to work before heading to a hardware store and buying a Stanley knife, disposable gloves and plastic sacks which he used in the killing. 

When the first woman he tried was unavailable, he booked to see Ms Nowikiewicz, arranging to meet her at her flat, where she worked as a prostitute to fund her studies.

The jury was told how Wenham, who was working on a project for the Office of National Statistics in Southampton, had been not taking his medication for depression in the days before the killing.

'The killing was utterly premeditated, planned and clinically executed,' Alan Blake, prosecuting, told the jury of six men and six women.

'Attacking her from behind, he sliced open her neck, cutting through her major arteries and her spinal chord. There was no evidence that she had been able to even try to defend herself. 

'The first prostitute he tried was unavailable. Tragically for Karolina, he booked to see her instead. There is no evidence to suggest that they had ever met before.

'Having killed Karolina and left her face-down on her bed, the defendant washed himself in the bathroom, placed the bloody knife in a drawer in the bedroom, went outside and called the police to admit to what he had just done.

The court was told that after the killing, Ms Nowikiewicz was left face-down in her bed, before Wenham took a shower to wash himself clean and called police

'Although the victim was a prostitute both psychiatrists seem to agree that this was not in fact a sexual killing, in that there was no evidence of sexual assault, consensual sexual activity or even arousal.

'Karolina was chosen because her job made her an easy target.'

The jury heard how a friend of Ms Nowikiewicz, who was visiting from Poland, had seen large arm 'with a black tribal tattoo' through a crack in the door shortly before the prostitute was killed. 

Katarzyna Rutowska said she heard the shower running soon after Wenham arrived at the flat, then Ms Nowikiewicz uttered a weak moan and the words 'I am sorry.'

A short while later  Wenham called police to tell them he had just killed a prostitute.

When asked if it was deliberate or an accident, he replied: 'I don’t know' before giving his name and home address and hanging up to call his wife.

In a phone call to her, he said: 'Hi, it’s me, I’ve done a stupid thing, I’ve killed someone, I’m really sorry, I’ve killed someone.'

He then begged her not to tell the couple’s two boys, aged six and five. They also have a one-year-old daughter.

The first officers at the scene found Wenham sat by the side of the road outside the block of flats with his head in his hands.

The jury at Reading Crown Court was told that the killing of Ms Nowikiewicz (pictured) was 'premeditated, planned and clinically executed'

When they approached him he told them: 'I can’t believe I have done it.'

He was taken to a police station in nearby Maidenhead, where he told the custody sergeant that he had recently been circumcised and that he was bandaged as his penis was not healing properly.

When police trawled through his medical records, they found a draft letter from a GP written in support of an application for a firearms certificate.

The jury heard that a post mortem examination showed that Karolina was stabbed at least four times in the neck and that the injuries were consistent with her having been attacked from behind. 

Wenham, from Uxbridge, Middlesex, denies murder.

The trial continues.
