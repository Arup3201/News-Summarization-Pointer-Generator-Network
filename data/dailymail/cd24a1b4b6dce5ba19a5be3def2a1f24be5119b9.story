Gareth Southgate insists complacency will not jeopardise England’s preparations for Euro 2015 as he urged his Under-21 squad to make another statement of intent.

They will be aiming to secure a 12th consecutive victory under Southgate on Monday night when they travel to Brest to face France in a game the head coach believes will provide another step up in their preparations.

England’s performances have consistently improved this season and their 3-1 win against Portugal last Thursday was the particularly satisfying for Southgate, as it was secured without a number of players who would be considered first-choice starters.

Long winning sprees at this level, however, can occasionally provide false hope. England, for instance, went to Euro 2013 on the back of nine straight victories without conceding a goal only to flop in the tournament, losing all three games in Israel.

But Southgate does not believe a sudden dip will be an issue for this group, as he is certain their preparation — which includes games against the Czech Republic and Germany next March — will not leave them undercooked for the European Championships.

‘We don’t have (complacency) — we certainly wouldn’t tolerate or allow it,’ said Southgate. ‘We ramp up the challenge for them each time and the fixtures will naturally do that. We have not got fixtures between now and the summer that will allow us to take our foot off the gas.

‘Competition for places does that also. A run like the one we have been on would only give you false hope if you were playing teams like we faced in our group. We have covered a lot of things they may face and it will help before we get to the tournament.’

Southgate has a fair idea of which players he will include in his squad next summer and he has again stressed that he will not be looking to flood his 23-man party with some of the big names that are still eligible for selection.

The game against Portugal showed the team can function as Southgate wants even when key individuals are absent and the performance at Turf Moor showed how his methods have been taken on board over the last 15 months.

‘That is one of the most pleasing things, really,’ said Southgate. ‘Everyone who comes in knows what we want and that is reflected in the players that we pick.’
