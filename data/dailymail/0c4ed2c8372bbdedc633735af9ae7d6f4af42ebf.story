An Australian woman has been killed in an avalanche in Austria.

The 27-year-old woman was snowboarding off-piste with three other Australians in the Landeck district in the state of Tyrol in the far west, local media reported.

A 30-year-old man was seriously injured. He was flown to an Innsbruck hospital, 80km to the east.

The other two people, a man and a woman, reportedly escaped serious injury.

The accident happened at midday local time and ski patrols, alpine police and two helicopters were involved in the rescue, local website Heute reported.

Although the cause of the accident has not been confirmed, local police claimed the snowboarders had triggered the avalanche.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade says it is providing consular assistance to the woman's family. 

It has been tumultuous winter in Austria this year, with at least 22 people killed by avalanches, the Fairfax Media reported.

The sudden rise in deaths comes as the European country experiences the heaviest snowfall in 15 years.

In January, two of the United States ski team died while training in Soelden - in Austria's west - after an avalanche wiped them out.

More to come.
