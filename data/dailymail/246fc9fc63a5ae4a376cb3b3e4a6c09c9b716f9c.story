Closed: New York-based cupcake and coffee shop has closed 48 stores in 10 states

'It’s a real curveball for us,' a manager at the Crumbs in Brooklyn Heights said. 'Normally, you get two weeks' notice when you’re closing down — you don’t get one-day notice.'

The company, which had already closed a number of its stores in recent months, said in a statement, 'Regrettably Crumbs has been forced to cease operations and is immediately attending to the dislocation of its devoted employees while it evaluates its limited remaining options.'

Those options could include a bankruptcy filing, the spokeswoman said. 

As of the end of last year, Crumbs, which opened on the Upper West Side in 2003, listed 165 full-time employees and about 655 part-time hourly employees as working in its stores.

Crumbs listed on the stock market in 2011 at the height of the cupcake boom.

Crumbs posted a loss of $18.2 million last year, layered on a loss of $10.3 million in 2012

Crumbs made its mark selling 4in, frosting-laden cupcakes in flavors such as cookie dough, caramel macchiato and red velvet cheesecake, costing generally $3.50 to $4.50 each. 

But the popularity of high-end cupcakes has sunk in recent years with competition from chains such as New York's Magnolia Bakery and Los Angeles-based Sprinkles. 

Trading of Crumbs shares on the Nasdaq index were suspended on July 1 after the company failed to meet a requirement of either having at least $2.5 million in shareholder equity or meeting benchmarks for its market cap or annual net profit. 

Crumbs posted a loss of $18.2 million last year, which followed a loss of $10.3 million in 2012, according to securities filings,The Wall Street Journal reported.

The company's cash on hand fell to $893,000 at the end of 2013, down from $6.3 million the prior year.
