Sky Sports News presenters were forced into an apology this morning after Dermot Gallagher used the word ‘Holocaust’ live on television in reference to the incompetence of the fifth official during Juventus’s first goal last night.

Former referee Gallagher, a regular pundit on the channel, was asked why UEFA’s fifth official was unable to see Alessandro Matri's shot cross the line first time.

Claudio Marchisio followed up but the linesman gave the goal to Matri.

Gallagher said: ‘The problem for me is I don’t think there is any tangible evidence that they do anything.

‘But for a Juventus player following up a shot very, very quickly we could have had another Holocaust last night.

‘I am convinced that the assistant and the guy on the goal line don’t know the ball is in.’

His comments instantly created a storm on Twitter and presenters Rob Wooton and Hayley McQueen apologised live on air minutes later.
