So, Akinfenwa looks like a big boy...

He certainly is. The AFC Wimbledon striker is 5ft 10in and tips the scales at around 16 stone. It’s not just for show, though — FIFA 15 recognises him as the strongest player in the world.

But is he any good?

The Beast has achieved a decent goal return at practically every club he’s played for, including eight in 22 league games for AFC Wimbledon this season. He has never been above League One in England, but played for Lithuanian top-flight side FK Atlantas between 2001 and 2003.

Good touch for a big man?

As his pirouette away from Philippe Coutinho and Mamadou Sakho in the first half showed, he has nimble feet. But Akinfenwa is most effective in a crowded six-yard box and his inclination to jump in where it hurts was vital to his team’s equaliser.

Is that him with Steven Gerrard's shirt? 

Good eye! He wanted to wreck the Liverpool captain's FA Cup but warned his team-mates not to bother trying to get Gerrard's shirt afterwards. 

'I want Gerrard's shirt,' he said. 'I've told the boys that if anyone get's his shirt before me we are going to have a problem. Especially with the announcement that this is his last FA Cup run with Liverpool.' We wouldn't argue with him...

Anything else we need to know?

Yes, he owns his own clothing company — named Beast Mode On, after his imposing physique — which is ‘all about defying limitations people put on you’, according to its website.
