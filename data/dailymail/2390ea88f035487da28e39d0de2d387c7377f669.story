Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola has insisted his side did not deserve to lose to Manchester City and only did so because they handed the game to their opponents.

Sergio Aguero scored a hat-trick as City came from 2-1 down to win on Tuesday night. 

Mehdi Benatia's first-half sending off made life difficult for the visitors, and although they did manage to take the lead courtesy of Xabi Alonso and Robert Lewandowski, Aguero's ruthless efficiency ensured all three points went to Manuel Pellegrini's side.

Guardiola said: ‘We lost but I am very proud of my team. As a coach playing against the Premier League champions is a challenge and we played with ten men for much of the game. We played an aggressive game, it can happen in the Champions League.

'If it happened in the last 16 we would be out.

‘We dominated, but we made two mistakes and lost. We didn’t deserve this. When we play **** we lose.'

He added: ‘We gave them the game. They had hardly any chances with 11 against 10... we were tired in the last 10 minutes.'

City travel to Rome for their final game of the season but regardless of their result against the Italians they will still be eliminated if CSKA Moscow beat Bayern.

Guardiola, though, reassured City the Bundesliga champions would not take it easy against Leonid Slutsky's side, despite having already won the group. 

He said: 'Manchester City know that we will try to win the CSKA game.'
