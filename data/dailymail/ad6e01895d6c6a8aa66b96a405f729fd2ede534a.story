Billy Davies is the favourite to replace Ally McCoist on Sunday night after the Rangers manager was finally allowed to walk away from the club he stood by during the darkest days of liquidation.

The Ibrox outfit confirmed that, just over a week on from handing in his 12 months’ notice, they had put the head coach on gardening leave. 

Assistant manager Kenny McDowall has been put in charge ‘until the end of the season’, according to the official statement, although there is a strong chance that a new man will be in place before then.

McCoist and the board failed to reach an agreement on an early departure last week, raising the prospect of the manager hanging around to lead the team, despite working his notice. 

But directors moved on Sunday night to remove the ‘lame duck coach’, agreeing to continue paying him the monthly instalments of his £750,000 salary to stay away — at least until they can finalise a settlement.

His departure clears the path for a new man to step in above loyal lieutenant McDowall, with Davies believed to be the front runner. Stuart McCall and Terry Butcher, like Davies both out of work and ready to start immediately, are also likely to be candidates.

McCoist’s departure on the eve of the AGM removes one potential embarrassment for a club who have declared annual losses of £8million — and revealed they need the same again merely to stay in business.

Putting him on gardening leave effectively silences him, too, with any public attack on the board — or embarrassing revelations about how things have been run during his time as manager — risking putting him in breach of contract, thereby weakening his claim for compensation.

The club released a statement at 8.45pm on Sunday, saying: ‘Rangers would like to announce that Ally McCoist is relinquishing his duties as manager and will serve out the remainder of his 12-month notice period on gardening leave.

‘We would like to thank Ally for all his hard work and dedication over the last few years, but we feel it is now in the best interests of all parties to move on. Assistant manager Kenny McDowall will take over his duties until the end of the season.’

Meanwhile, Dave King’s receding chances of launching a rival rescue bid for Rangers appear to have hit a fresh obstacle — a potential resumption of hostilities with the South African tax authorities.

Newcastle owner Mike Ashley is expected to tighten his grip on the Ibrox club at Monday's AGM, as the board and new chief executive Derek Llambias — very much Ashley’s man in situ — outline plans for the Sports Direct tycoon to underwrite the £8m share issue needed to keep the business alive. 

Mike Ashley is keen to impress his stamp upon Rangers as soon as possible

King, who saw a £16m rescue package rejected earlier this year, remains keen to get involved.

But reports emerging from South Africa at the weekend suggest that his reported £44m settlement with the tax man could be open to review and dramatically increased.

An investigation led by a Johannesburg advocate has reportedly uncovered evidence that the South African Revenue Service had illegally spied on taxpayers it was targeting — including some it subsequently struck deals with.

The investigation into ‘rogue behaviour’ also calls into question the legality of deals done — with King named as one of the most high-profile individuals allowed to pay back just a fraction of the tax allegedly owed.

South African president Jacob Zuma has been called upon to launch a full commission of inquiry. Even the suggestion of a renewed investigation could tie up King’s time and funds while the threat of a huge new bill may scupper any last chance he has of buying into the club.

SIGNINGS

Despite the club's financial implosion, McCoist has had money to work with during his three-and-a-half year reign as boss. But the 52-year-old repeatedly put his faith in players he knew with Scottish Premiership experience who failed to recreate their former performance level.

Allies of the manager will point out that he did not have a scouting network to rely on, but moves for highly-paid figures like Ian Black, Nicky Law, Jon Daly, Kenny Miller and Kris Boyd simply did not work, while others signings such as Emilson Cribari, Francisco Sandaza and Arnold Peralta were outright failures.

STYLE OF PLAY

The signs were good for McCoist when he first took over and Rangers managed to rack up a 15-point lead over Celtic in his first season. But as that lead was thrown away, a frailty in his management was brutally exposed.

But worse was to come for the former Scotland striker as despite the mammoth resources he could call upon as he faced up to part-time minnows following the club's liquidation, his side often struggled.

Tactically naive, one-paced and lacking creativity, the club's faithful soon grew tired as they toiled against sides they should have been ripping apart.

CONTRACT

Rangers have staggered from one crisis to another - all the while wasting millions of pounds in the process.

But McCoist did himself no favours by accepting an £800,000-a-year deal to manage the club while it was marooned at the depths of the Scottish game.

Even when he volunteered to take a 50 per cent wage cut, many fans were disappointed that it took several weeks of negative headlines before it was finally agreed.

McCoist's salary then increased to £750,000 a year when he handed his notice in and as recently as Friday the manager was adamant he would see out his notice period.

YOUTH DEVELOPMENT

Many Gers supporters thought that by going down to the Third Division, Rangers would be able to flood their team with young recruits while they stock-piled cash for their Premiership return.

But McCoist was reluctant to put his faith in his Murray Park youngsters, claiming they were not good enough to see the club back through the divisions.

The only youngster to have made any impact in recent years has been Lewis Macleod. The Scotland Under-21 midfielder is undoubtedly a promising talent but one graduate from an entire youth system seems wasteful to many.

CUP RECORD

Since replacing Walter Smith in the summer of 2010, McCoist has failed to win a single cup competition in 11 attempts.

Rangers remain in this season's two major domestic knockout tournaments but suffered fresh shame when they blew a two-goal lead against Alloa as they crashed out of the Petrofac Training Cup semis earlier this month.

Other humiliations include losing last year's Challenge Cup final to Raith Rovers and being taken to a replay by League Two outfit Albion Rovers.
