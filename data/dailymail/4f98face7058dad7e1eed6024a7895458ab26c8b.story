Forget Delia Smith and Rebecca Adlington – there’s only one retirement of note this year. Mark Roberts, the world’s most prolific streaker, has stripped for the last time – and your intrepid reporter was there for his finale, wearing just a pair of Crocs.

For two decades, the Liverpudlian father-of-three has been the Usain Bolt of the naked dash. In 1995, he leapt naked on to Fred Talbot’s weather map on daytime TV show This Morning, and a year later he appeared nude on the green during the Open at Royal Lytham.

Then, in 2004, he was fined £550 for trespassing after streaking across the pitch at the Super Bowl in Texas – a match watched by 130 million people in 87 countries.

Flashback: Mark Roberts is hanging up his birthday suit after stripping off 519 times, including at the 1996 Open at Royal Latham when he was escorted from the green by police officers

Winning streak: the 48-year-old once ran out onto Centre Court during the men's final of the Wimbledon Tennis Championships

No balls please: The streaker, who was lead away from Centre Court with a blanket covering his private parts, has given up streaking

For good measure, Mark has also stripped off at Wembley, Wimbledon and Ascot.

‘There’s
 no major venue or event I haven’t done,’ he says proudly. ‘But I’m 
nearly 49 now and my children have begged me to stop. It’s time. I’m not
 ready for my slippers just yet, but gravity’s against me.’

Last
 week, for his last outing – his 519th and final streak – I joined him. I
 would love to say that sitting naked on a bench in an icy 
Buckinghamshire park was somehow a freeing experience. But, with my 
modesty barely covered by an A4 notepad, I would be lying.

Blue
 with cold, I felt utterly ridiculous, a feeling not helped by the barks
 of derision from passers-by. Mark, of course – pro that he is – took 
the whole episode in his stride. But I was further discomforted to 
notice that even he, unlike me, was wearing clothes, after a fashion: a 
monkey G-string.

‘Isn’t that cheating?’ I asked. He 
laughed: ‘I’ve shown my todger enough now, I think I’ve earned my 
stripes. Anyway, it’s the buttocks that make people laugh.’

And
 that’s the key to Mark’s 20-year ‘career’. Middle-aged with a proud pot
 belly, he cuts a comical figure, wholly devoid of vanity. The title of 
his planned autobiography says it all: I Didn’t Know An Inch Would Take 
Me This Far.

Tutu clever: Mr Roberts protected his modesty with a swimming cap and tutu when he jumped into the pool during World Swimming Championships in Barcelona in 2003

‘I’m no Muscle Mary or porn star,’ he 
says. ‘That’s why it’s funny. I’m just a regular, 16st fella. If I was 
buff, I’d just be a poser.’

His odd obsession began by accident in
 1993 when he saw a woman streak down the pitch at a rugby Sevens game 
in Hong Kong. ‘I was working in a bar over there and I was a bit merry,’
 he says. ‘When I saw that girl I said out loud, “Pah, anyone could do 
that.’’ Some bloke replied, “OK, big mouth, you try it,’’ and I said, 
“All right then.”

‘It was just ale talk. But the next 
day there was a bang at the door and it was a mate with a taxi waiting. I
 couldn’t back out then.

‘Everyone
 was dancing and clapping at the stadium and I started getting a buzz 
off the crowd – my heart was thumping through my chest. So I pushed to 
the front and took my shoes and socks off.

‘I
 ran backwards to wave to the crowd and, as I turned round, there was 
the ball. I picked it up and ran the whole length of the field and 
scored a try. Against the All Blacks. There and then, I was hooked.’

Therein
 lies the nub of Mark’s compulsion: he loves to make people laugh. He 
says: ‘My first time changed my life. Everyone should try it once. I’d 
never had any history of nudity. I’m actually quite shy. On a beach, I’m
 coy and I’ll get changed under a towel. But when I perform, I’m like a 
different man.

Cold front: In 1995 the Liverpudlian father of three leapt naked on to Fred Talbot¿s weather map on daytime TV show This Morning

‘What I realised that day in 1993 was that while I could perhaps make four or five people laugh by telling a joke in a pub, I could, just by doing something daft on a pitch, make tens of thousands of people laugh.

‘I don’t have a compulsion to take my clothes off. It’s only the laughter that matters. It’s nothing like flashing. There’s nothing sexual about it – it’s just comedy nudity.’

Not everyone gets the joke. His scuffles with over-zealous security guards over the years have left him with two broken toes, four broken ribs, a broken finger and 25 stitches in his leg.

In 2007, Merseyside Police sought an anti-social behaviour order banning Mark from displaying his buttocks and genitals in public. But the judge rejected the application, saying Mark’s behaviour did not cause real distress.

That viewpoint is what marks him apart from Stephen Gough, the so-called Naked Rambler, who has spent six years in jail after walking the length of Britain in the nude.

On one occasion, for example, Gough was jailed for a breach of the peace after a judge said he had ‘intentionally caused shock and alarm to children and their parents’ after he deliberately [walked] naked past a busy children’s play-park’ – despite ‘repeated police requests not to do so’.

Not so super: Mr Roberst was carried off the field by Houston Police after he delayed the start of the second half of Super Bowl XXXVIII in Houston, Texas in 2004

‘He thinks it’s his right to walk naked wherever he wants and that has clearly caused offence,’ says Mark. ‘I just set out to entertain people and always in a big arena. I’m no threat to anybody.’

But Mark has been kept in a cell overnight 30 times and fined a total of £4,000. Single for nine years, Mark has three children – Rebecca, 24, Mark, 19, and Georgia, 15 – by two different women but he no longer speaks to either of the mothers.

It was a recent remark by son Mark that made him decide it was time to call it a day. Mark Snr says: ‘He said to me the other day, ‘‘Dad, when are you going to stop, all my mates are watching you?’’ I asked him, “What do they say?’’

‘And he said, “They all laugh their heads off.’ So I replied, ‘‘What’s the problem, then?’’ He just said, “Well, you’re my dad.’’ That really hit home with me.’

Mark left school at 15, with no qualifications. Now jobless, he lives in a £400-a-month rented house in Anfield, Liverpool, but he is a strangely proud man.

‘I’m not on the dole, my mates are helping me out. I’ve always found a way to support me and the kids. And, streaking or not, I will again.’

Not that streaking has proved a big earner. ‘I made a couple of grand from underwear adverts in Spain ten years ago,’ he says. He is also the star of a Channel 4 documentary to be screened this week.

So, unhappily, I joined him for his swansong – and he does have a point. There is, if our ad hoc audience is anything to go by, something inherently comical about two foftysomething blokes running across a park in the middle of February.

As we thankfully reclaim our clothes after a streak that will be – for us both – our last, Mark says: ‘That’s it now, I’m done. But you always want more out of life, don’t you? You never know what’s on the other side of a door unless you open it. I’m ready.’
