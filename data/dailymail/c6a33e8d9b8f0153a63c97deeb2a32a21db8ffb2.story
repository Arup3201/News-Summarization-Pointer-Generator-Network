Charges? Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson has said that his department is pursuing an investigation into whether or not to charge Louis Head for inciting the Ferguson riots

Michael Brown's step father Louis Head could face charges for inciting the mob violence that left parts of Ferguson a smouldering wreck this time last week, claims the city's police chief.

According to Thomas Jackson, the Ferguson Police department is 'pursuing' an investigation into whether Brown was in part responsible for starting last weeks fiery riot by screaming 'Burn this motherf****r down! Burn this bi**h down!' on discovering the grand jury's decision.

Speaking on Monday night's Fox News, Jackson was asked by host Sean Hannity whether he believed charges should be pressed against Head for his role in the disturbances that evening, posing the question, 'Is that inciting a riot?'

In reply, Jackson said, 'We are pursuing those comments. And there is a lot of discussion going on about that right now. But I really can't get into that right now.'

An indignant Hannity questioned Jackson about whether political pressure may make it expedient for any investigation against Head to be quietly dropped.

'Is there an atmosphere where maybe there is a group in law enforcement, maybe in the prosecutors office arguing, 'Oh we should just let it die?'. But, wouldn't that just encourage people to act the same way and feel they can get away with it?' said Hannity.

In response, Jackson appeared unequivocal, saying, 'No, we can't let all that happened in the community die.

'Everyone who is responsible for taking away other people's property, their livelihoods, their jobs, their businesses, every single one of them needs to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.'

It was last Monday, after spending months appealing for calm that Michael Brown's family exploded into rage when it was announced that the grand jury had decided not to charge Officer Darren Wilson.

Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, stood sobbing and screaming on top of a car with her husband and friends outside Ferguson police department.

She wore a button pinned to her chest that read 'Indict Now and a white hat with a photo of her son which called for 'Justice for Mike Brown.'

'They wrong!' she yelled, pointing toward the police station. 'You all know, you're all wrong!'

Although she wore sunglasses, her anger and devastation were clear as tears ran down her face.

'Everybody wants me to be calm. You know what them bullets did to my son!'

'They still don't care!' she screamed as she threw her arms in frustration. 'They never going to care!'

She then buried her face in her the chest of the victim's stepfather, Louis Head, who wore a t-shirt reading: 'I am Mike Brown.'

He turned around to the incensed crowd and screamed: 'Burn this b**** down'. He did this at least ten times and called for a microphone at one point to spread his message to more people.

At that, some of the crowd did become agitated toward the police.

Wearing a t-shirt with the words 'I Am Mike Brown' while was expressing his rage toward the crowd and cameras, Head also had a beanie on that had a photograph of Michael Brown. 

As the roaring crowd began to surge forward, the pair were both whisked away by supporters.

Head has a long rap sheet which includes two felony narcotics convictions and he pleaded guilty in 1997 to marijuana distribution and was put on probation for five years.

In mid-2003, he pleaded guilty to a felony count of narcotics trafficking and he was sentenced to seven years in prison.

He was released in 2008 after five years behind bars.

The family released a statement immediately after the grand jury decision via their lawyers which read: 'We are profoundly disappointed that the killer of our child will not face the consequence of his actions.

'While we understand that many others share our pain, we ask that you channel your frustration in ways that will make a positive change.

'We need to work together to fix the system that allowed this to happen.

'Join with us in our campaign to ensure that every police officer working the streets in this country wears a body camera.

'We respectfully ask that you please keep your protests peaceful. Answering violence with violence is not the appropriate reaction.

'Let's not just make noise, let's make a difference.'

Ahead of the grand jury decision, Michael Brown's father released a statement Monday afternoon, which read: 'After the grand jury's decision, we are asking for 4 1/2 minutes of silence to remember why we lift our voices.

'We are not here to be violent. We are here in memory of our son.

'We are here for protection of all children. We are here to support justice and equality for all people.

'We lift our voices to ensure black and brown men, women, and children can live in this country without being devalued because of the color of our skin.'

And over the weekened, Missouri Lieutenant Governor Peter Kinder spoke to conservative radio host Laura Ingraham and said that Head should be arrested for inciting the riots.

'When you heard that sound-bite from the stepfather of Michael Brown,' said Ingraham, 'what was your reaction?'

'That he should be arrested and charged with inciting to riot,' Kinder replied.
