Pope Francis has condemned the use of the death penalty, saying nothing can justify it and there is no 'right' way to humanely kill another person.

He outlined his opposition to capital punishment in a letter to the International Commission Against the Death Penalty, a group of former government officials and jurists.

Following their audience with the Pope at the Vatican on Friday, he wrote the principle of 'legitimate personal defence' does not justify executing someone.

'No justification': Pope Francis has condemned the death penalty as a form of vengeance rather than a way of granting justice to victims

Opposition: Pope Francis said nothing can justify the death penalty and there is no 'right' way to humanely kill another person

The Argentine pontiff said: 'When the death penalty is applied, it is not for a current act of aggression, but rather for an act committed in the past.

'Nowadays the death penalty is inadmissible, no matter how serious the crime committed.' 

He was referencing teachings by the church that suggest modern prison systems make executions unnecessary. 

Pope Francis added that capital punishment 'does not render justice to the victims, but rather fosters vengeance'.

'For the rule of law, the death penalty represents a failure, as it obliges the state to kill in the name of justice.'

Although he did not mention the United States specifically, he spoke about debates centred around which methods are most humane.

He added: 'There is discussion in some quarters about the method of killing, as if it were possible to find ways of "getting it right". But there is no humane way of killing another person.'

In previous comments, Francis even denounced life imprisonment as another punishment that cannot be justified.
