Some of the most expensive cities in the world to visit may actually be the most affordable to inhabit if you're between the ages of 15 and 29.

A study from Toronto-based Youthful Cities, a global social initiative that ranks the world's top cities from a youth perspective, has found that Paris, Toronto and Los Angeles are the 'most affordable' for young adults.

London ranked tenth as the study analysed the cost of everyday items in 25 of the world's biggest cities.

According to new data compiled by Youthful Cities, Paris ranks as 'most affordable' for young people

 Paris has a high standard minimum wage, as well as discounted municipal transit rates for youths

Cities that usually rank as some of the toughest on the wallet are also some of the more attractive ones once the cost of food, housing and public transport is factored in along with basic entertainment costs that make a city a liveable, youthful place.

'More than half the world's population lives in cities and more than half the world's population is under 30,' Research Director, Matthew Cosgrove, told MailOnline Travel.

'Young people are mobile and drawn to places that are inclusive.' 

This survey also takes into consideration the current minimum wage rate in each city. 

The report said: 'Since youth rely on entry level jobs when they enter the workforce, we feel tying costs to an hour of minimum wage labour is the best way to measure a city's affordability from a youth perspective.'

And Paris takes top marks, coming in with a standard wage of approximately £8.10.

Paris was followed by Berlin (approximately £7.50) and Rome (£7).

Berlin also offers significantly cheaper rent than its cosmopolitan counterparts, largely because the rental market is strongly regulated.

Tokyo (£6.45) and Toronto (£6.38) rounded out the top five.

The report ranked London in sixth place. The UK's current minimum wage rates are £6.50 for those 21 and over, £5.13 for people aged 18 to 20, and £3.79 for people under 18.

Nairobi finished last in the ranking of 25 cities with a standard wage of just 8p. 

In second place was Toronto, where an affordable apartment rental market is just one of its offerings

In Los Angeles, cheap transit options and affordable eats are readily available to residents

For those looking for affordable nightlife, the European capitals of Berlin, Paris, and Rome were found to offer high-quality, cheap entertainment, including low-cost live gigs.

Istanbul can't be beat when it comes to quick, affordable getaways. According to the survey, the ability to take a city break is a top urban priority.

Several cities included in the study are undertaking even more initiatives to make themselves more appealing to youth.

In Bogota, discounted transit is the norm for students while many students in Tel Aviv are privy to a housing subsidy.

Paris offers both. Young people are eligible for discounted rates on the city's bike-share programme and cheaper municipal public transit fares on weekends, as well as the APL housing subsidy, which is available to all students.

The top-ranking City of Lights offers both discounted travel options and an APL housing subsidy to students
