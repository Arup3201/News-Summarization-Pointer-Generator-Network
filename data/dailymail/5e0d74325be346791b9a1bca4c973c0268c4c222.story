Police have launched an investigation after it emerged that Scots had been selling votes on eBay

Police have launched an investigation after it emerged that Scots have been trying to sell their referendum votes on eBay for as little as £1.04.

Adverts offering the chance to buy a ballot slip for the September 18 vote were spotted by the Electoral Commission and quickly removed by the online auction site.

One seller believed to be Chris O'Connor from Glasgow, who goes by the eBay username ‘chrisoc1986’ sold his vote for little over a pound.

The listing read: ‘This is my very own unique piece of British History! It is my personal YES or NO vote for the upcoming Scottish Referendum in September.

‘I for one, do not give a flying monkeys about any of this. This could be the deciding vote. Who knows?

‘I am a hard working Scottish citizen with a house, a gorgeous wife and two beautiful kids who are my world.

‘This vote will not change anything in our lives so I have decided not to vote my opinion but instead..... ONE OF YOURS! Happy Bidding’.

He is also believed to have posted the listing on Twitter saying he was hopeful for a 'wee earner'. 

Another seller named 'catfez' put a £10 reserve on bidding for their vote, and claimed any money raised would be donated to charity.

Police Scotland today confirmed officers were investigating the listings.

A spokesman said: ‘Our policing arrangements for the referendum are well in hand and will be appropriate and proportionate.

‘Police Scotland's priority is to ensure public safety and security. We will respond appropriately to any issues which arise.

‘We are investigating these incidents and therefore cannot comment on the outcome of these incidents until all inquiries are concluded.

‘Where other incidents are reported they will be investigated and appropriate action taken.’

A spokesman for eBay said the company ‘does not permit’ the sale of certain items.

He said: ‘In addition to our own investigations, eBay uses reports from users and advice from third party experts to keep eBay safe and to ensure that items of concern are not listed for sale.

‘The Electoral Commission has an agreement in place where we remove upon request any items posted on eBay that relate to an individual's vote where the Commission has concerns that this could lead to the law being broken.’

A spokeswoman for the Electoral Commission has told the BBC it made an agreement with the auction site that any ‘votes for sale’ listings would be taken down and referred to police.

She also said that selling and buying votes was a criminal offence that could lead to a year in prison or a ‘substantial’ fine.
