The King may have left the building too soon but the chance to own his old tour bus, marriage certificate or even one of his prescription bottles is still alive.

A number of Elvis Presley's personal items will soon be put up for auction, including the 'TCB' tour bus that he personally bought for his backup band Sumner and the Stamps

These are just some of the items Julien's Auctions of Beverly Hills will feature in the 'Property from the Life and Career of Elvis Presley' collection, which will be auctioned at the New York Hard Rock Cafe on May 16

These are just some of the items Julien's Auctions of Beverly Hills will feature in the 'Property from the Life and Career of Elvis Presley' collection, which will be auctioned at the New York Hard Rock Cafe on May 16. 

The standout is the 'TCB' tour bus that was once driven into a cornfield by the King of Rock and Roll himself.

Elvis personally paid for the bus for his backup band, Sumner and the Stamps. His signed $25,000 deposit check is framed on its wall.

According to Martin Nolan, executive director of Julien's Auctions, Elvis and JD Sumner were 'like brothers'. Sumner even sang at his funeral.

It was Elvis who said the band needed their own tour bus. Sumner was reluctant to take 'any financial funding' but eventually accepted and let his friend drive the bus whenever he pleased

It seats up to 12 people and includes nine sleeping berths. It has since been renovated to its original state

The two became fast friends in Memphis when Elvis was living in public housing, two blocks from the auditorium where Sumner and the Stamps used to perform every month. 

One month Elvis didn't show up to a gig. When he returned the next month Sumner asked about his absence. 

Elvis admitted he had to skip the show because he couldn't afford the 50cent ticket. From then on Sumner let him attend the shows for free.

The favor was returned when Sumner and the Stamps became Elvis' back-up band, touring with the King from 1971 until his death in 1977.   

It was Elvis who said the band should get their own tour bus.

Sumner had the bus 'decked out' as a tribute to Elvis and had the TCB lightning bolt logo, which was Elvis' slogan and stood for 'Taking Care of Business', emblazoned on the front of the bus

According to Nolan, Sumner was reluctant to take 'any financial funding' from his close friend but eventually accepted and let Elvis drive the bus whenever he pleased.

Nolan said Sumner 'decked out' the bus as a tribute to Elvis and had the TCB lightning bolt logo, which was Elvis' slogan and stood for 'Taking Care of Business', emblazoned on its front.

The TCB bus, which seats up to 12 people and has nine sleeping berths, has since been renovated to its original state.

The walls are decorated with Elvis records, pictures of the band and even an old set list. 

Nolan calls it a 'mobile museum' for the late great rocker. The bus' current price estimate is $100,000-$200,000, according to the Associated Press. 

Also up for auction is the King of Rock and Roll's 1971 two-seater Stutz Blackhawk car, which is estimated to sell for $400,000 to $600,000

Also included is the personalized diamond necklace Elvis gave to his nurse Letetia Henley Kirk and one of the singer's old prescription bottles

But that's not even the priciest item up for auction. Elvis' 1971 two-seater Stutz Blackhawk car is estimated to sell for $400,000 to $600,000.   

Prospective buyers interested in something cheaper can try their luck with Elvis and Priscilla Presley's 1967 marriage certificate, which is estimated at $25,000-$35,000, according to the auction house's press release. 

And Elvis' medicine bottle, dated 1974, comes at a bargain estimate of $2,500-$3,000. 

Other items included in the sale are the singer's black Gibson J-200 Guitar, a military winter dress uniform, a penguin suit he wore in Las Vegas and a white knit cardigan from early in his career.  

Elvis and Priscilla Presley's 1967 marriage certificate is estimated to sell for £25,000-£35,000
