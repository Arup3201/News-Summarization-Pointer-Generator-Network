A company that manufactures baby video monitors is recalling almost one million batteries after complaints that they overheated, ruining the monitors and causing damage to property.

Summer Infant is recalling about 800,000 rechargeable batteries used in its baby video monitors because of a burn hazard.

The Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based manufacturer has received 22 reports of overheated and ruptured batteries, including incidents of smoke and minor property damage.

Total recall: Batteries from Summer Infant devices sold between 2010 and 2012 have been recalled

The hand-held, color video monitors were sold with a matching camera and A/C adaptors at Babies "R'' Us, online and other retailers from about February 2010 through 2012 for $149 to $349.

The batteries are about 1 ½ inches tall by 2 ¼ inches wide and are ¼ inch thick, black, and marked with TCL on the batteries' lower right corner.

Consumers should remove the battery and contact Summer Infant for a replacement.

The monitor can continue to be used with a power cord.

'The safety of our consumers is our highest priority. Therefore, out of an abundance of caution and in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, we have issued a voluntary battery recall in monitors that may have batteries manufactured in 2010, 2011 and 2012,' the company wrote on its Facebook page.

Many consumers responded to the recall on Facebook, saying their monitors had burned out but the company had told them earlier that there was no recourse.

Second time: Batteries from Summer Infant devices were recalled in 2011 for the same reason

'I got a monitor in Oct. 2011, 6 months later the battery never kept a charge and had to keep in plugged in when I was using it!! I called and they said there is nothing they can do! I was not happy!! So finally I came up with the money jan 2014 for a new one! [sic]' wrote one.

The recall comes after viewer Molly Sandlin contacted FOX 4 when her baby monitor burst into flames on her kitchen counter, filling the house with smoke and melting the monitor.

A forensic report commissioned by the family's insurance company concluded the battery inside the unit had overheated, swelled and started a fire, but after a year of trying to recoup thousands of dollars from Summer Infant for the damage, the family became frustrated.

Summer Infant told FOX 4 that the overheating incidents were isolated, but in light of further reports has issued the recall order.

Consumers can contact Summer Infant for a replacement battery at 800-426-8627 or online at Summer Infant.

The batteries were manufactured in China. About 58,800 batteries were recalled in February 2011 for the same problem.
