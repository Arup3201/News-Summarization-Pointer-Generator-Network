The World Cup is just two days away and the excitement is reaching fever pitch. For the last time, our man in Brazil, Joe Callaghan,
 brings us the latest news and views from South America - as well as 
traveller tips for those heading out there - and provides a flavour of 
exactly how the World Cup is shaping up.

What have Gilberto Silva and Heurelho Gomes got in common? One helped Arsenal win some North London derbies while the other played for Arsenal in them? Cruel, accurate but not what we're looking for.

Until Thursday rolls around, they remain the only players to ever be part of a Brazil World Cup squad while also plying their trade in the Premier League at the same time. That happened in 2s006 and 2010 respectively but it tells you just how changed and changed utterly the times are that on the eve of their tournament opener, the Brazilian manager's dilemma is very much a Premier League dilemma.

Luiz Felipe Scolari on Tuesday delivered the kind of sharp-tongued rebuke that he may have been famed for in the past but has been a rare occurrence in recent times. So stint has his second stint in the job been to this point that he hasn't needed to deliver a put-down to the press.

But three days from tournament kick-off, he'd had enough when he tackled the biggest talking point about his team head-on.

'External pressures will not influence my decision of starting Oscar ahead of Willian,' he bristled 'Oscar is the starter.'

In one brief exchange he poured icy cold water on the hottest topic in the host nation. It was a debate that has raged even more wildly since Friday's final friendly against Serbia when, just four days after a scoring cameo off the bench against Panama, Willian again was a difference-maker. Replacing the fitful Oscar at half-time, he gave Brazil so much more impetus going forward.

But then this is a six-month-old debate, one that is more familiar to Premier League observers. As Oscar struggled to hit his pre-Christmas heights after the turn of the year, Willian was making Stamford Bridge his own with increasing regularity, his transformation under Jose Mourinho one of the manager's finer achievements of last term.

He carried that through to national team duty and continued to knock on the door while Oscar struggled to look comfortable inside the room. But Scolari knocked all that back on Monday. It has always been thus with the man they call Felipão. His favourites are his favourites. And they just so happen to be the favourites.

Scolari was never likely to go for something as wild as taking a blunt implement to the starting XI he has cast in stone over the past 12 months. For the exact same reason, Willian is also not going to knock Hulk out of the right side of the attacking midfield trio that operate behind Fred.

It all means that, barring any more scares like Neymar's ankle roll that stopped a nation, the 11 who line up against Croatia in São Paulo in less than 48 hours will be the same that started Brazil's last competitive fixture - the Confederations Cup final romp over Spain.

With David Luiz having jumped across the Channel to Paris, there will be two Premier League starters in Oscar and Spurs' Paulinho but there will be another three in reserve. The times have changed and so has Big Phil - but not too much.

Willian probably did deserve his chance. But Scolari was never for turning. He had his favourites in 2002, look how that ended. And, no matter what, an out-of-sorts Oscar is still a damn sight easier on the pre-match nerves than Roque Junior was 12 years ago.

Good week: The tat vendors

Sitting in a São Paulo taxi for three hours - the perfect storm of a metro strike and a huge 'March For Jesus' religious extravaganza - gave us plenty of time for looking around on Saturday. And what was finally visible was some World Cup fervour.

It's been a long road to here for Brazil and a lot of the footpaths are unfinished. But here they are, now hours away from a World Cup on their doorstep and it seems that, in spite of the social ills that have and will continue to trouble the country, the nation is beginning to get in the spirit.

The daredevils who sell Brazil flags, whistles and horns not just street corners, but on the dividers in the middle of an eight-lane motorway have begun to reap the rewards. Not before time. They should earn danger money too.

Bad week: Morumbi Stadium

No one wants to hear journalists complain about getting in to football matches for free but when your view is so bad that play is blocked by a corner-flag, maybe a slight whinge is justified.

Had original plans come to fruition, Thursday's opening ceremony would have been held at Morumbi Stadium in São Paulo, the first choice for a World Cup venue for Brazil's biggest city. However authorities decided it was more practical to build the Arena Corinthians from scratch (shame they're still building though).

The media men and commentators should be relieved however as Morumbi features undoubtedly the worst positioned press area we've seen. Lower than pitch level, stuck at the corner and cut off by a running track, we think we watched Brazil play Serbia on Friday but we're not quite sure.

Quote of the week:

'Sadly, there’s a great deal of discrimination and racism, and this hurts me.'

Never mind the Jabulani or those Brazucas, SEPP BLATTER proves once more that it is he who has the biggest balls in the game - brass ones, undoubtedly - by accusing the British media of a plot to tarnish the 2022 World Cup. Four more years? Really?

Travellers' tip: Enjoy the daylight!

Walking through Copacabana on Monday evening we heard more than a few of the recently arrived 'gringos' asking slightly bemused if 'it always gets this dark this early'?

It is worth remembering again that it is winter in Brazil so by 5.30pm it is pitch dark. So if fans want to take in all the sights of Brazil's beaches, maybe sleeping in til early afternoon to shake off a caipirinha hangover is not the best policy.

The place to be: The Copacabana beach is a popular spot but make sure you get there early

Amazon forecast: How's the weather in Manaus?

After five months of very long-range forecasts here at the Blog From Brazil, we finally know what the sciencey folks are predicting for game time. While scattered thunderstorms will greet the Three Lions upon arrival, by Saturday it will be mostly sunny with highs of 32C and nighttime lows of 23C, humidity will peak at a sweat-tastic 84%. Rather ye than me lads.

Opener: England play Italy on Saturday at the Arena da Amazonia stadium in Manaus
