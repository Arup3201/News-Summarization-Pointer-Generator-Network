A serial 999 hoaxer repeatedly dialled ambulance operators – so he could sing them Elvis songs.

Charles Rush, 59, called to serenade them with tunes by the King of Rock 'n' Roll after getting drunk on New Year's Eve.

Police officers found him in a phone box at 7.50am on New Year's Day, Sunderland Magistrates' Court was told.

It is the latest in a series of breaches for Rush, who was slapped with a decade-long Anti Social Behaviour Order in 2005 for hoax 999 calls and has 355 convictions. 

Lee Poppett, prosecuting, said: 'The police officer asked him to put the phone down so he could speak to him.

'He replied "I want to sing Elvis songs to the nurses" and that is what he told the emergency services on New Year's Day. 

'Perhaps the only saving grace is that this is his only breach of this year.'

Rush admitted breaching his order by making an unwarranted emergency call and being intoxicated in a public place.

Gerry Armstrong, defending, said: 'On the evening of New Year's Eve he had been genuinely taken ill and was taken to hospital where he was treated and discharged.

Rush, who has an ASBO for hoax phone calls and 355 convictions, was given an absolute discharge at Sunderland Magistrates' Court (pictured)

'Unfortunately, after having a drink, he decided he wished to thank the nurses for their care, it would appear with an Elvis Presley song.

'Engelbert Humperdinck perhaps in these circumstances with Please Release Me would have been a bit more suitable.'

Homeless Rush was asked for A Little Less Conversation in future and was given an absolute discharge.
