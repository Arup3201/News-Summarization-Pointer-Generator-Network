A museum in China has closed following claims that its 40,000-strong collection of relics is made up of  fakes.

The Jibaozhai Museum, located in the city of Jizhou, in the province of Hebei, closed its ticket offices yesterday following claims that its extensive collection of ancient relics were knock-offs.

Problems for the museum began at the beginning of this month when writer Ma Boyong noticed  discrepancies and posted his findings online.

Staff at the Jibaozhai Museum have been left furious by its closing after the allegations about fakes

As reported by the Daily Telegraph, one error appeared to show artifacts engraved with writing which showed they dated back more than 4,000 years.

But, according to a report in the Shanghai Daily, the writing appeared in simplified Chinese characters, which only came into use in the 20th century.

Staff at the musuem have been left furious by its closing.

Speaking to the  Daily Telegraph, Wei Yingjun, its chief consultant, said he was sure that at least 80 of the museumâ€™s 40,000 objects had been confirmed as authentic.

He said: 'Iâ€™m positive that we do have authentic items in the museum. There might be fake items too but we would need [to carry out] identification and verification [to confirm that],'

He added that any objects of suspicious origin had been marked up so visitors could not be misled.

Mr Wei also vowed to sue the writer Mr Ma.

'He [acted] like the head of a rebel group during the Cultural Revolution â€“ leading a bunch of Red Guards and making chaos,' he said.

Musuems are currently booming in China, with government figures revealing that nearly 400 opened in 2011 alone.

But fake relics are proving a problem, with some reports suggesting that 80 per cent of fossils in Chinese museums are fake.
