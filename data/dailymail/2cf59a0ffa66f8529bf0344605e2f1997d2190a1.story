A former New Jersey Transit police officer who retired five years ago on a $2 million disability pension after accidentally firing a staple in his finger has been filmed using a gun at a shooting range.

Christoper Onesti, 34, admits that the state's retirement system is 'absurd' but claims the video does not show his claim was fraudulent as he was using the hand that was not injured.

Despite his apparent good health, he collects $45,936.24 a year tax-free from an accidental-disability pension. If he lives to 80, this will total at a $2 million cost to the taxpayer.

In 2006, he was stapling a target during a training session and accidentally shot the ring finger on his left hand, which is not the hand he shoots with.

Caught: Chris Onesti is pictured shooting at a driving range five years after he started receiving disability pension. He accidentally shot his hand with a staple gun and doctors said he was unable to return to work

Having fun: Onesti, who said the video only shows him shooting with his strong hand, said he knows it looks ridiculous but that he has done everything within New Jersey's law

He removed the staple, put on a bandage and continued the practice - but the following day he woke up with a swollen finger and filed an accident report.

Doctors concluded that he would not be able to apprehend or arrest a suspect or reliably shoot a weapon with the damaged hand, and recommended he be paid a disability pension.

Onesti, who was just 29 at the time, claims he asked to be switched to a desk job but he said officials told him he was not allowed to work with the police at all.

'My career was taken away from me without any choice on my part,' he told the New Jersey Star-Ledger. 'I was an unwilling participant in all this drama.'

Onesti
said he was initially approved for an ordinary pension, but in the wake
of a Supreme Court ruling, his lawyer told him he was eligible for accidental lifetime pension.

'I wasn’t the person who pushed the envelope,' he said. 'The only decision I made was to say, "Okay, I will take that".'

NJ
Transit spokeswoman Nancy Snyder would not comment on Onesti's claim that he was told he could not work in any department.

She
told the Star-Ledger that 'our outside insurance doctors reviewed and processed Mr. Onesti's
workman's comp claim,' but the decision was 'made 
exclusively' by the pension board.

Despite the ruling, Onesti, who has now moved states to near Philadelphia, continues to shoot and visits ranges a few times a year - and he said he understands why that would annoy people.

'It absolutely looks absurd,' Onesti said. 'But it's because the system is absurd.'

His hobby emerged when the website New
Jersey Watchdog and NBC4 ran reports about a video Onesti had posted on
his Facebook page showing him firing the Austrian sniper rifle.

Battle: Onesti says he told the New Jersey Transit that he wanted to work a desk job but they refused

Disabled: He accidentally shot a staple into his left hand's ring finger in 2006 and it became swollen. He said he does not think he'd be able to shoot with it - although he would shoot with his right hand anyway

He is seen gripping the gun and using his right hand - the stronger one. He then grins at the camera.

His
left hand shows no visible signs of damage but he said it is weaker and that
he does not believe he could put handcuffs on someone.

Onesti, who now works for a loss-management company, pointed out that he does not use his weakened hand at all in the video.

'I can honestly tell you: I followed the law,' he said. 'If people are upset about it, hang out outside the New Jersey Supreme Court. Don’t hang out outside my house.'

John Sierchio, a member of the New Jersey Police and Firemen's Retirement System pension board, agreed that Onesti had done nothing wrong and was simply playing with the system.

Following the rules: Members of the pension board for the New Jersey Transit Police (file pictured) said that more claims have been granted since they were told to consider injuries from slips and falls

He added that New Jersey has seen a increase in the number of accidental pensions after the state Supreme Court in 2007 and 2008 expanded the types of injuries that qualify.

It now includes mental illness to injuries sustained from slips and falls.

'This has to be the most expensive staple in the history of New Jersey,' Mark Lagerkvist from New Jersey Watchdog told NBC 4

'The
problem with the system is that it doesn't differentiate between the 
guy who puts a staple in this hand and an officer who was shot in the 
line of duty and is in a wheelchair for the rest of his life.'
