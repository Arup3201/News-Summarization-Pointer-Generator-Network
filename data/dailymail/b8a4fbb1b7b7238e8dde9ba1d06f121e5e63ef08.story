A man trapped underground for two days after entering a storm water drain to retrieve a $20 bill has been rescued - but he never found his money.

The unidentified man told police he quickly got lost in the labyrinthine drainage system after jumping into a sewer in Lawton, Oklahoma. He said he had no choice but to chase the cash.

Unable to find an exit, the man yelled for help for two days before a group of high school students heard his cries and called police.

Responding officers Sergeant John Chelenza and officer-in-training Alicia Redding said they couldn't believe what they saw.

Scene: A group of high school students walking through this intersection heard a voice coming from the manhole in the center of the street and called police

Rescue: Police said the man could have been wandering underground indefinitely if students hadn't heard his cries for help coming from the manhole in the middle of this street

Lost: The man said he dropped his $20 bill down a drain pipe that looked like this

The pair removed the manhole cover in the middle of a suburban intersection, and found the injured man cowering in a pipe about 15-feet underground.

The 42-inch pipe was so narrow, the parched man was forced to get around on his hands and knees.

'I was amazed,' Redding told KSWO. 'I was confused how he had gotten down there and amazed that he was still okay.'

Sgt. Chelenza said the man would have needed a ladder to get out of the cold, dark pipe.

'That's the first time in going on 28 years that we have found somebody down in a storm drain,' he said.

Police said the dehydrated man, from Lawton, was completely disoriented and couldn't remember the date, how long he'd been underground or the location of the drain pipe he initially entered.

'He had a bump on his head, he may have hit his head against a wall down there because it obviously pretty dark unless he is next to a storm drain where light could get into,' Sgt. Chelenza said.Â 

He said the man is lucky students responded to his cries for help because a map is necessary to navigate the pipes and anyone could go blocks without ever finding an exit.

'The kids were observant and astute. They did right by calling 911, and who knows they may have saved a man's life,' Sgt. Chelenza said.
