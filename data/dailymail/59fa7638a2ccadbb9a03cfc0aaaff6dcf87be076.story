She took a sabbatical from her illustrious modelling career to write, cook, present TV programmes, marry a jazz star and become a mother.

But now Sophie Dahl, granddaughter of novelist Roald, has stepped back in front of the fashion cameras to become the face of Aubin & Wills' new autumn campaign.

Woodland wonderland: Sophie Dahl models camel wool coat and maroon trousers for Aubin & Wills' new autumn campaign

The former plus-size model - who shot to fame in 2000 as the face (and, controversially, naked body) of Yves Saint-Laurent's Opium perfume - is joined by Dutch male model, Andre Van Noord in a misty, windswept, woodland photo shoot.

Wearing a selection of classic trenchcoats, pretty patterned blouses, rustic tweed jackets, camel wool coats, high-waisted dresses, dark trousers and cosy chunk-knit sweaters, Dahl, 34, is pictured in the natural surrounds of lakes and dewy grassland.

Shot by Annemarieke Van Drimmelen in both colour and black and white, the images perfectly encapsulate Aubin & Wills' classically inspired, contemporary British style.

The brand - which was established in 2008 as the elder sibling of preppy fashion house Jack Wills, set up in 1999 - has previously used Victoria's Secret model Rosie Huntington-Whitely and Libertines musician Carl Barat as its campaign stars.

The daughter of actor Julian Holloway and writer Tessa Dahl, Sophie Dahl was discovered by the late Vogue stylist Isabella Blow and, through Storm Model agency, appeared in campaigns for Versace, Alexander McQueen, Patrick Cox, Pringle, Cashmere, Godiva, Banana Republic, and Gap.

She published her first book - the illustrated novella The Man With The Dancing Eyes - in 2003,and has since become a contributing editor at British Vogue and a contributing writer to publications including American Vogue, The Saturday Times Magazine, the former Waitrose Food Illustrated Magazine and The Observer.

In March 2010, having married jazz singer Jamie Cullum in January, she presented a six-part cookery series entitled The Delicious Miss Dahl on on BBC2.

Dahl and Cullum have a one-year-old daughter named Lyra.
