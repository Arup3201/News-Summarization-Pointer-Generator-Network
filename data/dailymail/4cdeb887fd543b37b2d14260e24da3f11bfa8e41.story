Children must be taught how to make a profit if the country is to generate a new generation of entrepreneurs, David Cameron has said.

The Prime Minister said schools should do more to develop the future Richard Bransons and Karren Bradys, adding that he wanted to see business leaders visiting schools to share their knowledge.

Speaking to the Institute of Directors magazine he said: ‘Children need to know how money is made, about turning over a profit, about working in a team. The future Richard Bransons and Karren Bradys are out there.

'We need to bring alive their ambition by showing them what they can do – and our top business people will do just that by sharing their own stories and passing on their hard-won knowledge.’

His advice came after a survey by PR firm Edelman showed trust in business had fallen by four points to 52 per cent in a year. Asked why he thought trust in business had fallen, Mr Cameron said: ‘It is natural that during and after a recession people worry more – about their pay packets, job security, and yes, also about the role that larger firms play.

‘But rather than focus on the negative, I would say people are still very supportive of keeping Britain’s economy free and open, welcoming investment from far and wide.’

‘That said, businesses, especially large businesses, should consider how they can win back people’s trust - pay the tax they owe, ensure they do not exploit workers, protect employees and give them opportunities for pay and career progression.’
