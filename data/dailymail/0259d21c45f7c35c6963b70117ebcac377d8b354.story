Friends and family gathered today to say their final goodbyes to tennis player Elena Baltacha, who died from liver cancer aged 30.

More than 300 family and friends - including Judy Murray and Tim Henman - gathered at a private ceremony in Ipswich, Suffolk, dressed in their brightest colours, as a final tribute to the 'incredible, inspiring' woman.

Miss Baltacha, 30, known as Bally, died just two months after revealing she had been diagnosed with liver cancer and just six months after marrying her coach, Nino Severino, 48.

The coffin of Miss Baltacha, 30, is carried into the church where friends gathered in their brightest colours to say goodbye to the former

In a statement after the funeral, Mr Severino thanked everyone for their support, promising his wife's 'memory and spirit' would live on.

Miss Baltacha was described by her manager as an 'incredibly inspiring person' with a 'fighting spirit'

Miss Baltacha set up the Elena Baltacha Academy of Tennis in Ipswich to give disadvantaged children a chance to play tennis.

Her friends and family say they plan to put 'all their energies' into continuing the work Miss Baltacha started with the academy.

A fundraiser which she had planned for June to raise money for the academy, Rally for Bally, will now go ahead in her memory.

Mr Severino said: 'The tributes and love for Bally from around the world in the last two weeks and the way that everyone has got behind the Rally For Bally have made us so proud of her and how she touched people's lives.

'We would like to thank everyone for their support. We know that her memory and her spirit will live on.'

Mr Severino was supported at the funeral by Judy Murray, Miss Baltacha's long-time mentor, who walked with him behind his wife's coffin.

Others from the tennis world who gathered at the funeral included Laura Robson, Anne Keothavong, Annabel Croft, Tim Henman, Jeremy Bates and Jo Durie.

Lawn Tennis Association officials including chief executive 
Michael Downey were also at the service.

Mourners had been asked by Miss Baltacha not to wear black to the funeral and instead wore their brightest clothes in her memory.

Her
 husband, pictured, said after the funeral that he had been overwhelmed 
with the support since she had died and vowed that his wife's 'memory 
and spirit' would live on

He
 said he was 'so proud' to see how much Miss Baltacha had touched 
everyone's lives, especially through her charity work and tennis academy

The hearse which brought Miss Baltacha's coffin to the church carried floral tributes which spelled out her nickname 'BALLY X'.

There was also a lone piper in the churchyard at St John's Church to mark Miss Baltacha's links to Scotland.

Eleanor 
Preston, Miss Baltacha's manager and trustee of the charity attached to the 
Elena Baltacha Academy of Tennis, said after the funeral: 'She was an incredibly inspiring
 person.

'She was inspiring for people who might just have watched her play, watched her fighting spirit.

'All of us who were lucky enough to have her in our lives feel very fortunate.

'Although it was much too short a 
time, we all feel very much the same. She was always an incredibly 
positive and upbeat person.

Miss Baltacha's family asked that donations be made at the funeral towards the Rally for Bally cause, which has already raised £30,000 alone through JustGiving, in lieu of flowers

The tennis player's nickname, Bally, was spelled out with flowers and carried in the hearse to the funeral

'She didn't want people in black and I think it's appropriate that we've all worn our brightest possible colours today.

'It was part of Bally's instructions and also a reflection of her disposition and her demeanour.'

The
 family asked that, in lieu of flowers, donations be made to the Rally 
For Bally.

Nearly £30,000 has already been raised for the cause through the JustGiving page.

The 
tournament will feature Andy Murray, Ross Hutchins, Martina Navratilova,
 Tim Henman, Greg Rusedski, Jamie Murray, Jonny Marray, Anne Keothavong 
and Heather Watson.

The Ukraine-born tennis player, who later moved to Scotland, married her husband, her former coach, in December, one month after retiring from tennis due to ill health

All the funds raised will be split equally between Royal Marsden
 Cancer Charity and the charity attached to the Elena Baltacha Academy 
of tennis.

Ms Preston said: 'It's a really important project. It's something which is going to change lives and enrich lives through sport.

'That was always her dream: to bring tennis to people who weren't going to find tennis any other way.

'It's
 great we're able to honour her life by putting all our energies into 
helping to continue the work she started with the academy.'

More than 300 people attended the funeral to pay their respects to Baltacha

After she died, Judy 
Murray, who coached Miss Baltacha as a junior, said: 'She was one of the most selfless, undemanding, 
appreciative kids I ever came across.

'We
 want to do whatever we can to make sure she is remembered, to make sure
 she has a legacy and this academy, that was so dear to her heart, 
survives and thrives as long as we're around to do that.'

Miss 
Baltacha was born in the Ukraine, but moved to Perth in 1990 when her father, a footballer, transferred to Scottish side St 
Johnstone.

The family later moved to Paisley, Glasgow and she always considered herself to be British.

As a teenager, she was diagnosed with a 
chronic liver condition, known as primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), 
which had hampered her progress since her debut in 1997.

But she
 managed the condition - which attacks the immune system and can lead to
 cirrhosis of the liver, liver failure and liver cancer - with regular 
blood tests and medicine throughout her career.

Despite the disease, she won 11 single titles, with her best Grand Slam finish coming in the third round of Wimbledon in 2002.

She also reached the third stage of the Australian Open in 2005 and 2010. Her highest singles world ranking was 49, which she reached in September 2010.

Miss Baltacha became close friends with Judy Murray when she was a junior tennis player in Scotland.

Great Britain Fed Cup captain Judy paid tribute to her after her death, describing her as 'an absolute gem' and 'one in a million'.

Judy Murray and Laura Robson were in Ipswich on Sunday to take part in a tennis masterclass for 70 children aged between five and 13 at MIss Baltacha's academy.
