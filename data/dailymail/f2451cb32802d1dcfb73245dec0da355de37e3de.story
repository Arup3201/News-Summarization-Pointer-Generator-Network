Cesc Fabregas was involved in a light training session on Thursday, though it remains unclear whether the Chelsea midfielder will be fit for the title showdown against Manchester City this weekend.

The Spaniard, 27, limped off during the Capital One Cup clash with Liverpool with a hamstring problem minutes after colliding with captain John Terry at Stamford Bridge.

While Fabregas wasn’t able to take part in a full session with his team-mates at Cobham, he was assessed and is yet to be ruled out of Saturday’s game at home to the Premier League champions.

Fabregas picked up a hamstring problem after this collision with Blues team-mate John Terry

The former Barcelona and Arsenal star has impressed for the Blues this season, racking up 15 assists, the most in the league.

He was replaced by Ramires on Tuesday night, who would likely start against Manuel Pellegrini’s side should Fabregas not prove his fitness in time.

Mourinho said after beating Liverpool on Wednesday: 'Filipe Luis came off with a calf problem and Fabregas reported a tight hamstring. Fabregas said he wasn't yet injured but that he would be soon if he continued.

Meanwhile, the Porguguese boss has called off the pre-match press conference ahead of the crucial tie with City, as he fumes over Diego Costa’s FA charge for violent conduct.

Mourinho is furious with the FA and believes his leading goalscorer is being made a scapegoat following his stamp on Liverpool defender Emre Can. Chelsea will not even send in assistant Steve Holland to speak with the media.

Costa has confirmed that he denies the violent conduct charge ahead of Friday's FA disciplinary commission hearing.

Despite his protests of innocence, the Chelsea forward is expected to be banned for three games starting with Saturday's clash with City.
