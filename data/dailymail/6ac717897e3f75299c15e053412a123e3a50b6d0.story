A tatty Mini, which spent 20 years languishing in a garage and doesn't even start, has set a new world record after it sold for £31,000.

The dinky Austin Mini Cooper S's engine doesn't work, there are paint defects on the car's bodywork and it doesn't have an MOT or tax.

But despite its shabby appearance the iconic British motor was snapped up by a keen collector for almost four times its pre-sale estimate of £8,000.

Experts are thanking the entirely 'original features' of the almond green and white car for helping achieve the huge price - and say the result makes it the most expensive Mini Cooper S ever to sell at auction.

Matt Whitney, head of classic cars at 
Dorset-based auctioneers Charterhouse, said: 'The sheer originality of 
this car is what makes it so unique and valuable.

'Minis like this simply don't come on to the market much any more - they are incredibly rare. I would think there are fewer than a dozen of these cars existing in the world today.'

Shabby chic: despite its shabby appearance the iconic 1966 British motor broke the record when it went under the hammer for £31,000 in Dorset

Boys' toy: All the car's features are original from the 1275cc engine with twin carburettors to its two-tone interior trim and body panels. It has the ultimate spec for a Mini

The Mini was made in 1966, seven years after the model was launched by the British Motor Corporation. It had just three registered owners and 75,000 miles on the clock.

Its last owner, a doctor from Leicester, bought the car in 1968 and drove it until 1993 when he covered it up and left it in his garage after replacing it with a Peugeot 205.

Although it needs £2,000 spending on it 
just to make it roadworthy, the Mini could be worth even more than its 
enormous selling price once the work is complete.

Car collectors showed great interest in the battered old Austin Cooper S - bidding went through the roof and set a world record

The
 Cooper model, a collaboration with Formula One and rally car 
manufacturer John Cooper Cars, debuted in 1961 as a performance version 
of the popular car.

The Mini Cooper S was an even more powerful model released in 1963 featuring a souped up 1275cc engine.

As well as being sold to the public, it was popular on the race track and won the famous Monte Carlo Rally in 1964, 1965 and 1967.

Mr Whitney adds: 'All of its features are original from the 1275cc engine with twin carburettors to its two-tone interior trim and body panels. It has the ultimate spec for a Mini.

'The last owner bought it in 1968 and stored it in a garage for 20 years.

'That said, it needs a complete recommission because currently the engine doesn't work, it needs new brakes and the bodywork needs attention.

'It would cost about £2,000 to get it back on the road, and the market for an iconic car like this is only going one way - and that's up.

'There was a fierce bidding war between collectors who were set on getting their hands on this car. We knew it was a special car but it wildly outsold our estimated price.'

Auctioneer Richard Bromell added: 'This was not a mint condition car by any means - it has been used well.

'Lots of people were shocked when bidding went past the £16,000 mark. The final price is a world record for a Mini Cooper S sold at auction.'

It's £2,000 to get 
it back on the road, but the market for a car like this is 'up'
