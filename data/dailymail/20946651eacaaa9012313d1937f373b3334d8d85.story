The last time he moved to  Panama he was exposed as a fraudster, disowned by his  children and jailed.

But back-from-the-dead canoeist John Darwin has now told friends he plans to return to the central American country.

Under his parole conditions the conman is banned from travelling abroad, but says he will leave Britain when the authorities return his passport to him in March.

New life:  John Darwin is said to want to return to Panama, where he went with his wife Anne 11 years ago after he faked his death in a North Sea canoe accident

Scam: John Darwin's canoe was found floating on the water off this beach in Seaton Carew, Cleveland, but he wasn't dead at all

Darwin, 62, fled to Panama after he faked his own death in 2002, in a 
bid to claim almost £1million in life insurance and  pension payouts.

He and wife Anne, 61, were only exposed when a photograph emerged of them together in Panama City.

They were sentenced to six years in jail and stripped of their assets.

Now, his eagerness to return to the  country has raised suspicions that Darwin may have a secret stash of money there.

ASSETS WHEN JOHN AND ANNE DARWIN WERE CONVICTED IN 2008:

Panama bank accounts: $539,000 held in cash

Panama City apartment: $56,000 value

Land for business venture: $389,711.

Plus more than £3,000 in bank accounts in Britain and Jersey

BEFORE JOHN DARWIN FAKED HIS DEATH IN 2002:

£64,000 debt on 13 credit cards, costing £1,700 a month

Mortgage and bills: £5,639 per month

Mortgages of 14 different properties: £2,500

TOTAL OUTGOINGS: £6,700

TOTAL INCOME: £2,047

Meanwhile, the Mail can reveal that his son, Mark Darwin, is promoting a high-risk investment scheme in Panama.

Mark, 37, and his brother Anthony, 34, were convinced their father was 
dead and cut contact with their parents after their devastating lie was 
exposed in 2007.

However they are now believed to have reconciled.

Mark has launched a website advertising a high-risk foreign investment 
scheme attached to LifeClub International, which is registered in the 
tax haven of Panama.

The members-only club encourages clients to invest in risky foreign 
currency market schemes (Forex), which are unregulated in the UK.

His website, Markdarwin.com, tells prospective investors: ‘Relax knowing
 that your money is now working very hard for you even when you sleep!’

But even LifeClub admits there is a high level of risk, noting some consider Forex trading as ‘close to gambling’.

It states: ‘As a rule, you should only trade in Forex with money that 
you can live without.’

Members must invest a minimum of £10,000. John 
Darwin, a former teacher and prison officer, convinced police he had 
drowned when his canoe was found in the North Sea near Seaton Carew, 
County Durham.

He initially lived behind a wardrobe in the family home, but later 
obtained a passport using the identity of a dead baby and joined his 
wife in Panama.

When he returned to Britain in 2007, claiming he was suffering from amnesia, their lie unravelled.

The Darwins came up with the plot after their property empire failed and
 they racked up £60,000 in credit card debt. Despite his parents’ failed
 business, Mark has launched a secondary career as a ‘property investor’
 on his website.

He declined to comment when approached at his £200,000 semi-detached 
home in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, which he shares with his 
wife Felicia, 35, and their two-year-old son.

The Crown Prosecution service has already recovered more than £500,000 –
 including a flat in Panama City – from John and Anne Darwin.

But his money problems will apparently not stop him from returning to 
Panama. A source close to Darwin said: ‘He reckons he will get his 
passport back in March and he intends to go abroad.

‘I joked “Are you going back to Panama then?”. He smiled and said “I just might do that”.


‘His problem is financial – he hasn’t got any money.’

Plot: The house where John Darwin lived in secret through a wardrobe door before he took on a new identity

Speaking from his £100,000 bungalow in Seaton Carew, Darwin said: ‘I’ve got nothing to say.’

When asked if he had money problems he said: ‘It would be the same if 
you asked 90 per cent of the population.’ Darwin, who survives on a 
state pension, is estranged from his wife and claimed two

years ago that
 he planned to divorce her.

A neighbour said: ‘John was very open about his past when he first moved in, he seemed to revel in his notoriety.

‘He is constantly talking about the women in his life, and carries a 
picture of his girlfriend, who he says is 32. You would think he was 
God’s gift to women.

‘He is full of himself, and reckons he is going back to Panama when he 
can. But for all he brags about his fame, you can tell he has no money.’
