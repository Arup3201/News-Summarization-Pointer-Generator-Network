Shocking discovery: Abbas Lodhi, 49, and one of his sons were found shot dead in the parking lot of this A & P supermarket in Pleasant Valley

The two children have been identified as Zain Lodhi, 9, and Mugthba Lodhi, age 13.

Ryan said a shotgun believed to have been used in the killing was found with the car.

Yesterday, law enforcement officials said they were looking for Sarwat Lodhi but would not reveal how she was injured or whether she was the children's mother, saying only that she was a member of the immediate family and may be in need of medical attention.

However, Sarwat Lodhi’s Facebook page features a photo of her flanked by her two sons, one of whom appears older than the other. The image was posted in mid-August.

‘I think it's one of the most or more tragic things I have seen,’ Ryan said at a news conference. 'I find myself having two young boys that - it's emotional seeing what has happened to these kids. I couldn't even put into words how tragic it is for all of us.'

Pleasant Valley is a town of about 9,000 residents about 75 miles north of New York City, near Poughkeepsie.

According to online records, Abbas Lodhi owned a pharmacy in Hyde Park. Sarwat Lodhi, nee Bhatti, is listed as a resident of nearby Goshen.

State police responded to the parking lot of the A & P supermarket in Pleasant Valley at 8.30am after getting a 911 call about dead bodies in a car.

Inside the vehicle, a silver Nissan Pathfinder, officers discovered Mr Lodhi and one of his sons shot to death, The Poughkeepsie Journal reported.

An investigation into the killings led police to a second crime scene, believed to be the Brookside Meadows Luxury Rental Community on West Road.

Inside one of the units, responding officers found the body of Lodhi's other son.  

Police told the New York Daily News that they are not searching for a suspect and called the deaths a 'family tragedy.'

A press conference will be held Friday at 5pm.
