The Australian family of Bali Nine drug smugglers Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran have made the long journey to visit them on Indonesia’s ‘death island’.

Chan and Sukumaran are awaiting their execution by firing squad on Nusakambangan, in Cilacap, off Central Java, while they hold out desperate hope that a last ditch legal appeal will bring them mercy.

On Channel 7's Sunday Night it was revealed Sukuraman knows the identity of 'Mr Big' - the ringleader of the heroin syndicate he was convicted of being part of - but has never wanted to name him publicly as he feared for the safety his family.

Sukuraman told the news program he had tried to trade this information to avoid the death penalty, but Indonesian police refused the offer. 

'We tried with the police to get some sort of co-operation thing but there weren't really like that was our only card that we had to play,' he said.

'They wouldn't and then the lawyers advised us not to go that way.'

On Monday, five days after they were transferred from their home of ten years in Bali’s Kerobokan prison, their family were allowed to visit them.

The family members were driven in a motorcade from the airport in Cilacap before climbing aboard a small boat, assisted by embassy officials, to visit the Nusakambangan prison island. 

Michael Chan, the brother of death-row prisoner Andrew Chan, and Chintu Sukumaran, the brother of Myuran Sukumaran spoke to journalists at Wijayapura port.

Hopeful that it won’t be the last time they see their loved-ones, Chan's mother Helen and Sukumaran's parents Sam and Raji and his sister Brintha also made the emotional journey.

The Age reports Chinthu told reporters: 'My mum, sister and I have been waiting and counting down the days. We have been told he is doing well but we just want to see for ourselves, just make sure to go and see him, to let him know that we love him.'

Michael said: 'Mum is fairly excited to see Andy today and it's been a few days, you know. We are looking forward to seeing him when we get over there.'

Lawyers for the death row inmates say there are positive signs in a grim situation.

The legal team will be back in court on Thursday where they will present a high level argument that Indonesia's president is subject to Indonesian law.

Their fresh appeal for clemency for the pair will be heard in an administrative court in Jakarta.

‘The main promising thing for us is that they're not dead,’ lawyer Peter Morrissey told ABC radio on Monday.

‘The way some officials were talking, they should have been dead weeks ago.’

Jakarta has indicated it plans to wait for the result of legal appeals of some of the 10 drug felons waiting for the firing squad.

On Sunday, footage emerged of doomed Bali Nine ringleader Chan speaking about second chances just hours after the first round of executions on January 18.

The heartbreaking video shows Chan speaking from what is believed to be inside Kerobokan jail.

Behind him prison bars are visible as he looks tearily into the camera and talks in soft spoken tones.

The 30-second video was aired on Channel Seven's Sunday Night.

'My name's Andrew Chan,' the convicted drug smuggler said.

'It's a day - pretty much a few hours - after the execution of six innocent lives.

'Guess what runs through my head is about how precious life really is.'

On January 18, five people were executed by firing squad on Nusakambangan - Indonesia's 'Death Island - in Central Java.

Dutchman Ang Kiem Soe, Brazilian Marco Archer Cardoso Moreira, Nigerian Daniel Enemuo, Malawi's Namaona Denis and Indonesia's Rani Adriani were killed that day. 

Another woman Tran Bich Hanh, from Vietnam, was also put to death nearby.

Their deaths triggered Chan to ask: 'I guess sometimes you kinda got to think, what does it take to get a second chance?

'People get second chances within their lives on the outside, but how much can you get when you’re a convicted criminal.'

Since they were sentenced to death, Chan converted to Christianity and studied to become a pastor while behind bars.

At the same time, Sukuraman - under the tutelage of Ben Quilty - has become an artist, even teaching inmates how to paint.

This turnaround in the pair has led many to believe they have been rehabilitated.  

Sukuraman also admitted on Sunday Night he had thought about hanging himself or getting someone else to shoot him.

'I don't really think I'll enjoy the process of being dragged in front of a firing squad,' he said.
