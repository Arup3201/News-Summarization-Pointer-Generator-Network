Ally McCoist decided to quit as Rangers manager after becoming increasingly dismayed and disillusioned by events behind the scenes.

Friday night’s Championship defeat to Queen of the South was a fitting end to a miserable day for the Ibrox club.

And Sportsmail understands McCoist has had enough following job losses to long-serving staff as part of an ongoing, cost-cutting programme

It’s thought Jimmy Sinclair, head of the club’s youth academy at Murray Park, is set to be the next victim of the cull.

McCoist has reached the point where he is willing to give up more than £400,000 of the settlement he would be due had he instead been sacked by the Ibrox board.

The 52-year-old handed in his notice on Thursday but will serve out that 12-month period unless the directors negotiate a deal over his contract or place him on gardening leave.

That has effectively created a stand-off with the board as Rangers are in the grip of a cash crisis — requiring fresh funding in the New Year — and cannot afford to pay up the terms of his rolling contract.

By leaving under his own accord, McCoist is understood to be due 12 months’ cash. He took a 50-per-cent pay cut to aid the club earlier this year but his severance is based on his original £800,000 salary. Had he been sacked, however, it is believed he would have been eligible for an 18-month pay-off.

The dramatic development over his future emerged just hours before Rangers travelled to Dumfries for last night’s match.

McCoist was in the dugout but for how long will be the question after this latest extraordinary twist in the Ibrox saga.

He was already under pressure from fans following poor results this season but, as has become the norm at Rangers, finance will dictate what happens next.

Last night McCoist repeatedly refused to deny he’d offered his resignation when quizzed about the day’s events after the 2-0 loss.

Asked if fans deserved clarity, he said: ‘I think they will probably get some clarity. I obviously can’t comment myself. I think the club will probably comment. I would just like to take this opportunity to thank the fans for their support. They certainly didn’t get a performance tonight and I’d like to apologise for that.’

He added: ‘I’m the Rangers boss and I’ll be doing everything to make sure we get back in the fight for promotion. I have absolutely no comment on rumours.’

Pressed on whether the board had approached him upon hearing the reports, he replied: ‘I’ve no comment to make on speculation.

‘We will be back in tomorrow and I will be acting as if nothing has changed. I told them (the players) I was the Rangers manager and I’d continue to be Rangers manager.’

As for the day of fevered analysis, McCoist said: ‘I’m stating the obvious when I say it’s not ideal preparation but, in the grand scheme of things, it’s been an eventful three-and-a-half years, so nothing shocks me any more.

‘I wouldn’t say I’m angered. I was completely focused on the game. It’s my job to manage the team and prepare them — and we did that.

‘But I have to say to the Rangers fans it was absolutely not good enough and there are no excuses.

‘You can’t make any excuses about speculation. It’s not good enough.’

Pressed on reports his players were heading for a Christmas night out tomorrow, McCoist said: ‘I wouldn’t say they are confined to barracks, but they will be in.’

Rangers are thought to be closing in on a new chief executive and finance director but Derek Llambias, former Newcastle managing director and ally of Mike Ashley, is currently playing a significant role in the running of operations.

That has involved redundancies to a number of staff in recent times as all aspects of the business are analysed.

McCoist is thought to have been considering his own position for weeks after feeling increasingly drained by the situation. And one source said: ‘A lot of good people have been leaving Ibrox recently and now it seems Ally will go.

‘There has been an increasing level of noise around his position and that has deflected attention away from real issues.

‘Maybe he is thinking that by taking a step back, the spotlight will now shine on the club and the people responsible for its future.

‘We all know significant funding is required and the directors will have to provide answers at the AGM.

‘Many people who have Rangers at heart have been dismissed but the pay of a maintenance man or a groundsman can’t come close to the amount of money that has haemorrhaged from this place.

‘McCoist has been dealing with the trauma of good, honest people being sacked as well as keeping the team on track for promotion.

‘I’m sure he is aware his side can be better but it could be said he has done more to keep Rangers together than anyone else.

‘This is not him walking away. The club will always be a part of him. He might be taking a rest after the most physically and emotionally draining period of his life.’

Former team-mate Stuart McCall, a contender to replace McCoist, said last night: ‘When the news broke, I was gutted. For Alistair to chuck it in after what he has been through… he’s not that type.

‘Something has happened and we don’t know what. If Alistair was to leave, the legend that he is, it would be a blow. Everyone talks about dignity, he has been a great figurehead of this club.’
