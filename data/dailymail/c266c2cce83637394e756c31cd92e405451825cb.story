First Lady Michelle Obama said all school children should have access to art and music teachers. 

Speaking at the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles, Mrs Obama said six million American children attended schools where there are no art or music classes. 

Mrs Obama was addressing the inaugural Jane Ortner Education Award lunch. She told guests that all arts organizations should follow the example of the Grammy Museum and help with education.

She said: 'Arts are a way to channel ... pain and frustration into something meaningful and productive and beautiful, and every human being needs that, particularly our kids

'And when they don't have that outlet, that's such a tremendous loss, not just for our kids but for our nation.'

Mrs Obama has worked with the Grammy Museum since 2009 to produce concerts and allow young people to attend live music events. So far the programme has brought 1,000 students to Washington for concerts. 

Mrs Obama said: 'Those are some of my favorite events at the White House,' Obama said.

The museum's executive director Bob Santelli said the institution hosts 35,000 young people a year.  

Singer-songwriter Janelle Monae, who received the Jane Ortner Artist Award, said music saved her when she was growing up in a rough neighborhood.

'Music helped me really deal with my emotions, when I could not articulate how frustrated I was.

 'It gave me the opportunity to get it all out.'

Her latest album,  'The Electric Lady,' rails against sexism, presenting women as subjects rather than objects.  

Mrs Obama complained that six million American school children had neither art or music classes 

The 28-year-old entertainer is active with the Grammy Museum's educational outreach, entertaining students at the White House and at the museum.

'I hope we have more mentors. More mentors than superstars.'

After accepting her microphone-shaped trophy, she brought out her band and performed a high-energy four-song set that included a cover of James Brown's 'I Feel Good.'

The first lady introduced Ms Monae, calling her a 'fireplug' and a friend, and revealing that the singer danced on a table during her White House performance.

Mrs Obama said: 'I love Janelle's message. I love that she is one of the young artists here that is making music that means something.'
