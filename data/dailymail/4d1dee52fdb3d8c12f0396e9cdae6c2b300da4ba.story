Silvestre Varela has left West Bromwich Albion, with fellow Hawthorns misfit Sebastian Blanco likely to follow within the next 24 hours.

The Baggies have cancelled winger Varela's season-long deal from Porto, allowing him to instead move to Parma on a temporary basis.

Fellow wideman Blanco is set to move to San Lorenzo in Argentina, initially on loan.

A club statement read: 'West Bromwich Albion today confirm that two of last summer's signings are leaving the club.

'Silvestre Varela has had his loan from Porto cancelled by mutual consent. He is now in talks with Italian club Parma.

'Meanwhile, the club are in the final phases of agreeing a deal with Argentinian outfit San Lorenzo which will see Sebastian Blanco leave The Hawthorns.

'Blanco is set to join the Primera Division club on loan until the end of the season when they will have an option to buy.'

Varela's move to Parma was then confirmed by the Serie A side.

The pair joined in the summer under former head coach Alan Irvine but Tony Pulis, who replaced the Scot last month, wants to revamp his squad.

Varela has made nine appearances, scoring once, after suffering an injury-blighted spell at the Baggies while Blanco has failed to make an impact.

He signed a two-year deal after joining from Ukrainian side Metalist in the summer but has not started in the Barclays Premier League, making just five appearances in all competitions.

Pulis has seen a bid for Callum McManaman rejected by Wigan Athletic but is expected to return with a second offer.

He retains an interest in Manchester United's Darren Fletcher and is expected to firm that up this week.
