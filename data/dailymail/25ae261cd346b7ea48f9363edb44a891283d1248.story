Aimee McWilliams was in serious danger of losing her sight as her eyes were starved of oxygen

After
 finally getting round to having a routine check-up for her contact 
lenses, Aimee McWilliams assumed it would be merely a formality.

Having worn contacts since the age of 14, the 33-year-old fashion designer from London had never experienced any problems with them.

The
 general advice is to avoid wearing contacts for more than eight hours a
 day. However Aimee, like many people, had been wearing them for much 
longer - in her case, for more than 14 hours every day.

This had 
slowly been starving her eyes of oxygen; while the damage wasn't 
apparent to the naked eye, it was spotted when the optometrist used a 
special microscope. Aimee was shocked to learn that she was in serious 
danger of losing her sight.

'I was horrified,' recalls Aimee, from  
London. 'I'd always worn my lenses from 7 am until nearly midnight. 
Nobody had told me that I was jeopardising my sight by wearing them for 
so long, though I  suppose I just said I used them daily.

'What 
frightened me even more was that there had been no signs anything was 
wrong - my eyes looked the same. And I'd delayed my annual check-up by 
several weeks because I was so busy and I didn't think I really needed 
one.'

Around 3.7 million people in Britain wear contact lenses. But 
many don't appreciate how meticulous you need to be about using them, 
says Hosam Kasaby, a consultant ophthalmic surgeon at Southend 
University Hospital and BMI Southend Hospital.

One of the risks is 
corneal neovascularisation, the condition Aimee had. As Mr Kasaby 
explains: 'The cornea - the clear outer layer at the front of the 
eyeball - is the only part of the body that gets its oxygen supply 
directly from the air rather than from the blood.

'But a contact lens acts as a barrier to that oxygen supply, so extensive wear can potentially starve the cornea of oxygen.

'The
 body compensates for this by  growing new blood vessels over the cornea
 to provide an oxygen supply, or corneal neovascularisation.

'Left 
unchecked, the eye can become covered with blood vessels, and turn the 
cornea opaque. In rare cases it can threaten sight.'

The problem is 
the condition can build up over several years - it's only when it gets 
to an advanced stage that contacts wearers become aware of a problem, as
 that's when it will cause red, irritated eyes, by which time it may be 
too late.

The general advice is to avoid wearing contacts for more than eight hours a day

Stopping wearing the lenses can cause the new blood 
vessels to collapse, though in severe cases, when there is excessive 
blood vessel growth, even if they collapse, they can cause scarring.

Corneal
 neovascularisation may be more common with standard soft lenses, which 
are made of water-containing plastic. The other main type of lens, gas 
permeable, while less flexible, allows in more oxygen, says Robert 
Glass, a Manchester-based optometrist.

'There are also newer types of
 soft lenses, known as silicone hydrogels, which allow more oxygen to 
pass through to the cornea than previous soft lens materials, making 
them healthier,' he says.There are lenses licensed for use during 
sleep, which are permeable enough to ensure there is minimal risk of 
corneal neovascularisation. But you should be assessed by an optometrist
 before using these.

It's not only corneal neovascularisation that's the problem with wearing contacts for too long. Lucia
 Paovesana, 27, says her big, round blue eyes, which she once considered
 her best feature, have been ruined through wearing contact lenses for 
more than ten hours a day, as the whites of her eyes are now often red 
and sore.

She's worn contacts since she was 14, then four years ago 
she began suffering eye infections every few months. 'If I was awake I'd
 wear lenses,' says Lucia, who lives in Tamworth and works in a bar. 
'But every few months my eyes would become red and painful. I'd leave 
the lenses for a couple of days and they'd settle down. But the cycle 
would repeat itself.'

Eventually, she saw her optician, who 
immediately referred her to a specialist at Ashfurlong Medical Centre in
 Sutton Coldfield, where she was diagnosed with blepharitis - 
inflammation of the eyelids - aggravated by wearing her contacts for too
 long every day. Blepharitis causes reddening of the whites of the eye 
as the inflamed lids scratch the surface. People wearing contacts are at
 much higher risk of blephar-itis, as the eye is more likely to be dry 
and prone to irritation.

Blepharitis cannot usually be cured, but 
the symptoms can be controlled by regularly cleaning the eye with boiled
 water (after it has cooled) and massaging it when closed to prevent 
deposits of sticky discharge and flakes of skin building up behind the 
lid.

She delayed an annual check-up and didn't think she really needed one

A few weeks after she discarded her lenses, as advised, Lucia's
 eyes began to lose most of their redness. 'But four years later, my 
eyes are still red in the corners and I felt I've really ruined my eyes 
by wearing contact lenses,' she says.

It's not only overuse of 
contact lenses that can threaten the health of the eye - carelessness 
with hygiene is an obvious problem. And, ironically, some patients think
 they are practising good hygeine but aren't, explains David Anderson, 
consultant ophthalmic surgeon and corneal specialist at University 
Hospital Southampton.

'Most people tend to wash their hands in the 
bathroom before putting in their lenses. But many are unaware that 
unless they dry their hands properly or if they leave their contact 
lenses uncovered in their case, they're potentially exposing themselves 
to a bug known as acanthamoeba. This lives in water tanks, which tend to
 provide the supply to bathrooms. As such it can be found on bathroom 
surfaces too.'

Acanthamoeba bugs stick to contact lenses and can then
 burrow their way through the cornea, causing acute pain. It's only at 
this stage that a sufferer would be aware they had a problem.

Prescription
 drugs may be able to treat the bug in the early stages, but specialists
 say it is very difficult to get rid of. In serious cases, the patient 
needs a corneal transplant but these have a high failure rate, resulting
 in sight loss. Other steps to prevent the infection include never 
swimming or using a hot tub or shower when wearing contacts, advises 
Jeff Kwartz, consultant ophthalmic surgeon at the Royal Bolton Hospital.
 'And never hold them under running water.'

Each year, infections 
cause around 6,000 cases of a severe eye condition known as microbial 
keratitis - inflammation and ulceration of the cornea that can lead to 
vision loss. Contact lens wearers are at a higher risk, since bacteria 
can get trapped in the lenses.

So how should you protect your eyes? 
Mr Kwartz recommends using daily disposable lenses, which are usually 
more expensive as each new lens will be sterile and will never need to 
be cleaned. If you do use monthlies - these are taken out and 
cleaned every night, and replaced after a month - rub them with the 
solution recommended by your optometrist before putting them in their 
case. The lens case should also be replaced every month, adds Mr 
Glass. 'Over time, cracks can form in which micro-organisms can thrive, 
leading to infection.'

And never reuse or top up disinfecting 
solution - put fresh solution in the case every time you take the lenses
 out, says Mr Glass. Rinse the storage case and leave it open to dry 
after use every day and clean it once a week with a clean toothbrush and
 contact lens solution.

But the most important thing is to try to 
limit lens use to eight hours a day and keep hands scrupulously clean, 
says Mr Kasaby.

'Break the habit of wearing lenses from the moment 
you wake up until you go to bed - when you get home from work, switch to
 glasses in order to allow the eye's oxygen intake to get back to  
normal. Or, if you have a social event, do this the other way round.'

As
 for Aimee, she feels she has had a lucky escape. She was advised by her
 optician at Optical Express to stop wearing her lenses immediately - 
and for good.

Once she stopped, within a few months the tiny blood 
vessels had collapsed and were no longer a threat to her vision. But she
 struggled wearing glasses - after years of wearing lenses they made her
 feel dizzy when she glanced to the side - and she decided to have laser
 treatment to correct her vision.

'Now I have 20/20 vision, but I 
still shudder to think I could have ended up losing my sight simply from
 wearing my contact lenses for much too long every day.'
