When it comes to robberies a boomerang is probably not the best weapon of choice. 

A man has failed miserably in his attempt to stick up a service station with the Aussie icon, by waving it at an attendant.

On Sunday afternoon, a Brisbane man entered the Shell service station at Tarragindi, south of Brisbane and threatened a staff member.

'He was asking people for money at the service station and had a boomerang in his hand', said a Queensland police spokesperson.

'It wasn't until he approached the attendant that the man raised his voice and started to become more threatening.'

'He left the service station and police were phoned,' he said.

Police recognised the 31 year old from Moorooka, the next suburb over, and located him a short time later.

He was arrested and given a notice of public nuisance.

'He was arrested but not charged,' police said. 'He didn't steal anything.'

The 31 year old did escaped a more serious punishment because no one was hurt during the incident.
