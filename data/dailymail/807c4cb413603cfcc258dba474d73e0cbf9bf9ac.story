With thousands of padlocks left along its railings by hopeful lovers, the Pont des Arts, which crosses the River Seine in Paris, is widely considered one of the most romantic spots on Earth.

But this famous ‘lover’s bridge’ has surprising competition from a huge metal structure on the other side of the world.

As the largest steel-arch crossing on the planet, standing more than 130 metres tall, Sydney Harbour Bridge could not be more of a contrast to this pedestrian walkway built in the time of Napoleon.

But since it opened itself up to intrepid climbers in 1998, Sydney Harbour Bridge has established itself as one of the most romance-inflected places in the Southern Hemisphere. More than 4000 proposals have taken place on its beams, and 25 weddings have been held at its summit.

The most romantic crossing in the world? More than 4,000 people have proposed on Sydney Harbour Bridge and 25 weddings have taken place at its summit

Popular tour: More than 14 million people have completed the Sydney Harbour Bridge climb since the opportunity to scale the Australian landmark first became available in 1998

Romance hotspot: Sydney Harbour Bridge has now become a popular landmark for people to propose, including Lucas Farrell (pictured) who popped the question at the summit to his girlfriend Natalie Rumble on Valentine's Day 2014

Starting point: MailOnline tested out one of three potential climbs to the top of Sydney Harbour Bridge to see what makes it the perfect spot to propose

It has now become so popular with couples looking to cement their relationship that organisers have had to come up with a way for rings to be carried to the summit surreptitiously and safely – using a simple gadget elaborately known as an 'ERD' (Engagement Ring Device).

Wanting to discover what has made the bridge such a hotspot for couples, MailOnline decides to test one of three potential trips up to the top – the two-and-a-half hour 'Express' climb.

Every day, several groups of up to 14 people ascend to the bridge peak, where they enjoy unrivalled panoramic views of the city.

All three climbs reach the top. The only difference is how you get there.

The 'Express' climb takes participants through the belly of the bridge rather than directly over it - a process which offers a good insight into the hard labour that went into building it.

Before we can start our climb, we have to change into overalls which make us look like extras from Ghostbusters.

Safety first: All climbers must wear Ghostbuster-esque suits and are attached to the bridge by a cable

Best way to see the city: Groups of up to 14 people climb the bridge every day with a knowledgeable guide

Long walk: The bridge spans 1149 metres in total but climbers only travel across half of it

Stunning vista: Even from the lower arches underneath the floor deck, the views are magnificent

Our tour guide John Kirkland then fits us with safety belts, before attaching us to a secure cable that runs the course of our climb - so that we are always attached to the bridge.

Once locked on, we are off and speeding along the lower arch - a long plank-like walkway – underneath the road deck which leads us out towards the water.

On the journey, John points out the old foundations of the Harbour View Hotel and reveals how locals fought to keep their pub when hundreds of homes had to knocked down to make way for the bridge.

They couldn’t save the pub, but it was rebuilt just around the corner where it still stands today.

Asked why the bridge has become such a hotspot for romance, John (who met his wife through working on the bridge climb) is adamant that it isn't all down to the inspiring views.

For Sydney-siders and the wider Australian public, the bridge is a reminder of a time of hope, when the country was desperately trying to fight its way out of the Great Depression of the 1930s.

Connecting people: Sydney Harbour Bridge brought the two communities situated on either side together

Before the bridge was built, it took Sydney residents three days to walk from one side of the harbour to the other

It also brought together the communities on either side of the harbour - two halves of the city which had been separated by the large expanse of water.

Before the bridge was built, it took locals three days to walk from one side of the harbour to the other, and the waterway was overcrowded with boats.

It took nine years to complete, and went nearly two million dollars over the estimated budget. But its completion represented the start of a new, more prosperous age for the city.

As we walk further onto the bridge, the gangplank no longer runs over ground, but over the water.

It is this part of the climb, rather than the lofty views at the top, which make climbers nervous – perhaps because it is so much easier to see the drop into the deep.

As we twist and turn through the metal gates and locks, John tells us that the bridge steelwork weighs an incredible 52,800 tonnes and required more than six million rivets - which gives a good idea of its magnitude.

Steep climb: There are more than 1,000 steps to reach the 134 metre tall summit of the bridge

Nearing the top: Climbers get unrivalled views of the Sydney Opera House, while other local landmarks such as Luna Park are visible in the distance

Huge task: It took nine years to complete the bridge, which is made up of 52,800 tonnes of steel

Cause for celebration: Parties were held around Sydney when the bridge finally opened in 1932

As we approach the summit on the lower eastern arch, John points out the exact spot where the two sides of the bridge were joined.

Work on the south side, by The Rocks, was started before the northern side - so as work progressed, residents of the city could see the two parts slowly rising to meet each other in the middle. ‘A bit like a relationship’, John remarks.

After years of watching this stately progress over the harbour, the two sides were finally joined.

The bridge was formally opened on Saturday March 19, 1932, prompting mass celebrations across the city. Officials organised parades, the locals threw street parties.

After climbing the final steps up a steep staircase, and working up a bit of a sweat, we finally reach the summit, which is every bit as spectacular as the brochure promises.

I feel fortunate to have picked a clear day with the sun shining and few clouds – we have unobstructed views up to 90km out in all directions over the city, including the iconic Opera House.

This is where the majority of proposals and weddings take place – sometimes on the spur of the moment, but generally planned with the help of bridge staff.

Final steps: After reaching the halfway point of the bridge, climbers take a last stairwell to reach the top

View from the top: When climbers make it to the summit, they are rewarded with incredible panoramic views

Expert: John Kirkland is one of several experienced Bridge Climb guides, and has witnessed numerous proposals at the summit

On bended knee: Climb guide John Kirkland demonstrates how the ERD - Engagement Ring Device - works

All prepared: The Engagement Ring Device is a simple wrist band with a ribbon attached that loops through the ring, preventing it from being lost

Hotspot: The majority of proposals take place at the bridge summit

John points out that after people have saved thousands of dollars for a ring, the last thing they want to do is accidentally drop an expensive diamond 134 metres – or five seconds – into the sea below while popping the question.

To prevent this, the company came up with the ERD. John quickly demonstrates how it works by hooking a ring on a ribbon which is attached to a simple band that he then wraps around his wrist.

The band can be safely transferred from hand to hand, so that after a perfectly-timed surprise proposal at the peak, the newly engaged recipient can safely take the ring and wear it on their own wrist during the descent back to the ground, without fearing it will be dropped into the ocean.

John has helped orchestrate numerous proposals, but reveals some people choose to do it without notifying the bridge staff, suggesting there have been far more than the recorded 4,000.

The descent is much quicker than the climb, and offers yet more stunning views of the Opera House, the Botanical Gardens and the Luna Park fairground.

But what makes the climb truly magical is not just the breathtaking vista over a beautiful city, but the story of the how the bridge came into being.

Sydney Harbour Bridge was a vital new connection that united two divided sections of the city. Almost a century on, it still has the power to bring people closer together.

Perfect conditions: On a clear day, climbers can see across the whole of Sydney and beyond

What goes up: The walk back down is significantly quicker than the climb up the bridge

Perfect setting for romance: The bridge was designed to bring communities together

Climbs of Sydney Harbour Bridge cost from AUS$218 (£117) for adults, and $148 (£80) for children aged 10-15. More information on 0061-2-8274-7777, or at www.bridgeclimb.com.
