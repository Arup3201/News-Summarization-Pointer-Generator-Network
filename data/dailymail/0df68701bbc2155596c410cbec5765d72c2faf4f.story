Margarita Clark, who has been jailed for 40 months after stealing more than £2.5million from friends to fund a lavish lifestyle 

DRESSED immaculately in designer clothes with Louis Vuitton accessories, Margarita Clark simply reeked of success.

Seduced by her perfectly groomed appearance, a 'Footballers' Wives lifestyle' and tales of her success refurbishing properties, friends were persuaded to sink huge sums of money into her business.

But the investments were used to fund her taste for luxuries, which included a converted barn home with Italian furniture, trips to top restaurants and five-star holidays – one on a Caribbean cruise with a personal butler.

When police caught up with her she had burned through more than £2.5 million.

One victim lost £1,050,000 and others lost six-figure sums. They are unlikely to get much back as Clark, 63, was £8,000 overdrawn when she was arrested. She has now been jailed for more than three years after a judge told her she had 'swindled and cheated' her friends, some of whom needed treatment for stress and depression.

One victim, a friend of Clark's husband Stuart for 45 years who lost £115,000, said: 'I trusted her like a sister and didn't think anything was wrong. I knew about her lavish lifestyle and just thought it was because her business was doing well.'

Another victim, who had known her for ten years and handed over £43,000, said: 'She's an awful woman. She showed no remorse at all.' Financial adviser Barry Fromson, from North Yorkshire, who lost over a million pounds, declined to talk yesterday.

But in a victim impact statement read out in court, he described how he had spent 40 years working hard so that he could enjoy his retirement.

'I now feel guilt and shame having to live with this error for the rest of my life and knowing my family will suffer,' he said.

A former next-door neighbour who went shopping and holidayed with the conwoman suffered a nervous breakdown after giving her £722,500.

Clark was a well-known figure in Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, where she lived in an £800,000 detached house with an integrated speaker system piping music into every room. A Range Rover and a new Mini were parked outside.

She and her husband, who is believed to be retired, would regularly go on holiday. St Albans Crown Court heard she spent about £60,000 a year travelling and would fly first class.

Life of luxury: Her Marbella villa was 'like something out of Footballer's wives'

Favourite destinations included Barbados, where she stayed in the Sandy Lane Hotel, a favourite haunt of the ultra-rich and the famous.

She also visited Dubai, Florida, Las Vegas and Puerto Banus in Marbella, where she had a four-bedroom villa which was described as 'like something out of Footballers' Wives'.

When in London she visited the Dorchester Hotel and she even treated one victim's family to afternoon tea at the Gleneagles Hotel in Scotland.

But the enviable lifestyle was built upon her victims' misery.

The greedy property investor, whose primary business was in Spain, began encouraging friends to hand over money and would string them along with excuses to avoid paying them back.

One victim even hired a private investigator when she stopped returning calls and disappeared from her home for a while.

She was finally arrested in September 2012 when a victim contacted the police – eight years after the scams began.

Clark's scheme was based entirely on goodwill. Her victims didn't enter into formal contracts when they handed over the life-changing sums.

Instead, they relied on the trust they had built up with an old friend. They were told the money was being invested in buying properties before they were sold on for a profit. When they enquired about their investments, they were assured they were safely locked up in deals.

Some had no idea they were a victim of theft until the police contacted them in 2012.

Some of Clark's victims were in the public gallery at St Albans Crown Court, pictured, and watched as she was led away to begin her sentence 

Prosecutor Anne Evans told the court on Monday: 'No doubt in the past she had been a successful businesswoman working in property refurbishing, renting and selling in Spain.

'But a time came when, for reasons best known to herself, she started to steal from her friends and associates.'

Some of Clark's six victims were in court when she was sentenced to 40 months in jail after admitting seven charges of theft. During the hearing it emerged her house had been repossessed. Her husband is now understood to live in a nearby village.

Recorder Brian Argyle said that her victims had suffered 'substantial losses'.

He added: 'The money has been spent by you on lavish and extravagant luxuries.

'The impact on their lives has been immense. Your behaviour has ruined them. You built up a relationship of trust and you breached that trust.'
