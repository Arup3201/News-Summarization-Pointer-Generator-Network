James Rodriguez is the poster boy who has illuminated this World Cup with five goals and two assists in his opening four games, leaving Neymar, Messi and Ronaldo trailing in his wake.

And while he may not have the same stellar profile of his La Liga peers, he has been raking it in with a series of glossy commercials.

The 22-year-old has featured in adverts for Adidas, as well as Colombian beverage Pony Malta, shampoo brand Clear and Nestle drink Milo.

Star: James Rodriguez has lit up the World Cup and been instrumental in Colombia's progress

Moment: Rodrguez's strike against Uruguay at the Maracana was one of the best in the tournament

Up and coming: Rodriguez as a 12-year-old lifting the trophy that set his career in motion. He was playing for Academia Tolimense in Colombia's traditional youth football tournament Ponyfutbol in 2004 when he scored a goal directly from a corner as he led his team to win the title

In an interview given in Spanish with Colombia's Suso's Show last year, Rodriguez talked about his younger days in Buenos Aires, when he didn't even have enough money for a long phone call back home to his parents.

'My parents were always very supportive with me,' he said. 'The rest of my family as well.

'When I was 15 years old, I went to Buenos Aires, alone. It was hard, obviously, but when you want to be somebody in life, you must go and make some sacrifices.

'Back in those days, there wasn’t a lot of money, so when I called my parents to speak to them it was only for a minute. I was speaking to them and the phone call went off, because the money ended. I was sad when this happened. I missed home and family.'

Serious: The Colombian rising star during one of his adverts for Adidas

After starting his career with Colombian team Envigado, Rodriguez moved to Buenos Aires in 2008 to play for Banfield. In 2010, Porto snapped up Rodriguez for £4.06million, a fee that seems like a bargain now, and he began to make a name for himself in Europe.

It was in his third season, when Radamel Falcao had left to join Atletico Madrid and Rodriguez saw more playing time, that the 22-year-old really caught the eye. Last summer, Monaco paid £35.8million for Rodriguez's services, and now the Colombian is dreaming of another big move to Real Madrid to play alongside Cristiano Ronaldo.

Before he came to Brazil and lit up the tournament, Rodriguez said: 'My first game for Colombia was against Bolivia, in 2011. I felt something wonderful, I felt proud, because I always wanted to play for my country and now I want to play in the World Cup.

'From my childhood the thing I remember the best is that I always wanted a ball, I was always thinking about playing football. It always was football.

'I always knew that my position would be attacking. I always wanted to score.'

But Rodriguez's ability on the pitch is matched by his acting skills, if his adverts are anything to go by.

Ball control: Rodriguez heads the ball during his advert for Clear shampoo

In an advert for drink Pony Malta, Rodriguez shoots the ball at various targets on the streets of Porto and the advert eds with the slogan 'Transform your energy into attitude'.

The 22-year-olds advert for Clear shampoo resembles an advert Ronaldo did for a shampoo. The scenery is dark with special lights that makes it seem like a lot of photographers are taking pictures of him. 

Rodriguez is wearing a shirt and on it is written ‘Clear’, the name of the shampoo. He enters a football field and starts to play. After the explanation of what the shampoo does, Rodriguez scores and celebrates and the crowd is also celebrating with him.

Through her paces: Rodriguez could have many more endorsements after his World Cup displays

His advert for Adidas miCoach begins with Rodriguez holding his football boots before inserting a special chip into the sole. He then trains with statistics and information on his performance flashing up on the screen.

Rodriguez then watches the data back on an iPhone, and the slogan 'Proof that you are fast' ends the advert.

There's no doubting he's fast, and with his excellent performances at this World Cup, there are many more endorsement deals awaiting the Colombian.
