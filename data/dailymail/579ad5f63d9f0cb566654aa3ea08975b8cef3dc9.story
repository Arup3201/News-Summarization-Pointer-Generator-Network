Fraud: Caryl Williams has admitted cheating the taxpayer out of £66,000 in benefits

A benefits cheat defrauded the taxpayer of £66,000 in order to buy a holiday home in Spain, a court has heard.

A judge told Caryl Williams she had been 'subsidised' by people less well-off than her and used the money to fund a lavish lifestyle.

Her fraud came to light after an anonymous tipster told the authorities she had been claiming benefits despite owning a second home and secretly living with her partner.

Williams, 57, has been ordered to repay the money she wrongly claimed - but she is having just £7.20 a week deducted from her benefits, meaning it would take 176 years to pay all the money back.

She pleaded guilty at Cardiff Crown 
Court yesterday to falsely claiming £58,406.04 in income support, 
£335.14 in employment support and £7,304.28 in council tax.

The
 fraudster had previously insisted she was innocent, but changed her 
plea at the last minute after a judge told her she would be likely to 
avoid jail.

She was sentenced to 10 months in prison, suspended for two years because of her previous good character and her poor health.

Williams
 was also ordered to wear an electronic tag and observe a nighttime 
curfew for four months, confining her to her home in Bridgend, South 
Wales.

Judge Tom 
Crowther told her: 'You have been thoroughly dishonest in obtaining 
money to which you were not entitled. This was theft of public funds 
raised by taxes on working people.'

He added that such frauds damaged the public trust, by casting suspicion on genuine claimants.

'There is not an endless pot of money
 and it diverts funds from those genuinely in need,' the judge said. 
'Your property in Spain has been heavily subsidised by those working in 
the United Kingdom.

'You
 see only an entitlement for yourself, not the fact that you have taken 
from the needy. You lived a lifestyle which many would regard as 
enviable and beyond their means.'

Home: Williams owns a house on this street in the town of Rute in southern Spain

Prosecutor Kayleigh Simmons said Williams' claims, which began in 1998, had originally been genuine.

But
 in 2012, there was an anonymous call to the benefit fraud line saying 
she had been living with partner Bryan Pinwell for years, and that they 
owned a property in Spain.

Checks
 revealed that his bank accounts and finance arrangements for two 
motorbikes and a large motor-home were linked to Williams' home, which 
was also the address he had given his employers.

The couple each have a 50 per cent share in a house in Rute, in southern Spain, which they bought in 2005.

Ms Simmons said: 'She later admitted she visited the property for two weeks once or twice a year, that her children also went there and that Mr Pinwell had agreed to leave his share to her family if he died.'

Mr Crowther told Williams: 'You were sitting talking about how to divide up, after death, property acquired by using a contribution of public funds. You were dividing that up as a gift to your children'.

Jeffrey Jones, defending, said that Williams was severely disabled due to multiple sclerosis, depression and diabetes.

He added that she is dependent on morphine for pain relief, and has difficulty dressing herself.
