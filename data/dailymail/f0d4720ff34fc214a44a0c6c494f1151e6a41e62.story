She was named after Jamacian singing legend Bob Marley.

Some say for her dreadlocks while others argue the Devon long-haired sheep was given the name because her trainer can't get her off the grass.

The reggae star's namesake, Bobbie Marley the sheep is one of the top attractions at a unique farm in Devon, dedicated to celebrating the animal.

It's Bob Baaa-ley. Adorable Marley the sheep, star of the show at The Big Sheep attraction in Devon, was named after the legendary singer Bob Marley

The colourful ribbons strung through Marley's long curly dreadlocks, is only one of the similarities she shares with the No Woman No Cry singer, who died following a battle with cancer in May 1981.

Strutting her stuff in the ring, the seven-year-old sheep mimics his stage presence, relishing her chance in the limelight and performing twice a day at the farm's popular Sheep Show.

Trainer Wes Richards, said: 'She's not called Marley because of her dreds, it's because we can't keep her off the grass.'

But Anne Tattersall, spokeswoman for The Big Sheep in Bideford, Devon disagrees.

She said: 'She was originally named Marley because of her colourful dreds but it has become a running joke that it's because we can't keep her off the grass.

'It gives the adults something to laugh about during the show.'

And she said the ewe is a hit with the children in the audience.

The marketing manager, who has worked at the attraction for 10 years, said: 'Marley is adorable.

'The kids love her in the shows and when the showman reveals the different theories about her name, it does give their parents a good giggle, while going right over their heads.

'With her long dreadlocks, she looks a bit like a tiny pony. She is really sprightly and loves getting the ribbons in her dreadlocks changed each week.'

Mrs Tattersall said Marley is one of a flock of 10 Devon long-haired sheep at the farm.

In total there are around 25 different breeds from around the world on show, all bred specially by the team, who celebrated their 25th anniversary this summer.

Mrs Tattersall added: 'The Sheep Show is so popular it runs twice a day during the summer.

'All the sheep come out to different music to make it fun and the showman spends time talking about the different breeds, so it is educational and fun at the same time.'

She added: 'It is a wonderful place to work, the type of place that makes you not want to work anywhere else.'

Mrs Tattersall added: 'At the annual shearing session, the shearer made sure he left her pure wool dreadlocks complete with colourful braids. It's who she is.'

The rare Devon long-haired breed produce more wool per sheep than any other breed. They are on the Rare Breeds Survival Trust's watch list, listed as a vulnerable breed.
