A senior doctor at a private hospital has been convicted of killing a patient.

Surgeon David Sellu, 66, was found guilty of gross negligence manslaughter over the death of father of six James Hughes, following a trial at the Old Bailey.

Mr Hughes, 66, died at the Clementine Churchill Hospital in Harrow, north-west London, on February 14, 2010.

Sellu, of Hillingdon, west London, was found not guilty of perjury after he was accused of lying to the victim’s inquest under oath.

Mr Hughes suffered an unexplained tear to his bowel after a routine knee operation at the privately-run Churchill Clementine Hospital in Harrow, northwest London.

Sellu ignored concerns that Mr Hughes was in excruciating pain and failed to operate for at least 24 hours.

Mr Hughes’ suffered blood poisoning as a result of the ‘exceptionally bad care’ and died of a heart attack on February 14, 2010.

Sellu was convicted after a month-long trial at the Old Bailey. Following the verdict, prosecutor Bobbie Cheema QC read an impact statement from Mr Hughes’ wife Ann about the effect on her family.

Mrs Hughes said: ‘Jim was much loved and cared for by his family. His extended family phoned and visited him while he was in hospital.

‘The pathetic reassurances that everything was in hand were categorically wrong and left Jim totally victim to an inhumane environment.

‘Jim would have been better cared for if he had collapsed in a back alley.’

Miss Cheema said: ‘They weren’t given the full information they should have been and didn’t realise quite how difficult the situation had become.

‘They feel they were denied the opportunity to help Jim in any way. Their trust in the authorities has been shaken.’Mr Justice Nicol is to sentence this afternoon.

Mr Hughes, a retired builder from County Armagh, Northern Ireland, was admitted to the BMI Healthcare-run hospital for a simple procedure to replace the knee joint.

Miss Cheema said that Sellu should have prepared for the operation to repair the tear in the bowel as soon as possible.

‘Sellu took on the responsibility to care for Mr Hughes and the failure to arrange an operation as soon as possible was the first failing of that care,' she said.

‘The second is the failure by the defendant to ask for a CT scan urgently.

‘The third breach is the failure to prescribe antibiotics which every medical expert and the defendant now agrees were vital to fight the infection and should have been prescribed that night.

‘These areas demonstrate that the defendant was negligent - all the information was there for him to take the necessary steps.’

Although Sellu knew his patient had a perforated bowel, he failed to operate for 40 hours and did not go to see his patient.

‘The defendant failed to treat Mr Hughes’ condition even at that stage. He didn’t go in to see his patient’, Miss Cheema said.

‘He didn’t clear his list of non-urgent operations, nor did he arrange for another surgeon.

‘He didn’t ask the hospital to break into any other surgery list.

‘He did not ask the hospital to provide a suitable anaesthetist and he did not send Mr Hughes to another hospital by ambulance to be operated on urgently.’

By the time Mr Hughes was brought into theatre, he had been in pain for over 40 hours and was in a critical condition.

Mr Hughes even had to call a doctor friend from his hospital bed because he could not explain to the Hungarian doctor on duty the agony he was in.

He died the following day.

‘Had Mr Sellu simply operated the night before, or even early during the day of the February 12, Mr Hughes would have had a very good chance of survival.

The Old Bailey heard that Mr Hughes was in so much pain he called a doctor friend from his private hospital bed because he could not explain to the Hungarian doctor on duty the agony he was experiencing

‘There was a series of missed opportunities and serious errors of judgment in his care of this patient and they combined to cause Mr Hughes’ premature death and the standard of care was exceptionally bad,’ Miss Cheema said.

Elizabeth Joslin, a specialist lawyer for the Crown
Prosecution Service, said: 'James Joseph Hughes was in hospital for knee
surgery when he, by chance, suffered a perforated bowel

'David Sellu's lack of care fell far below the expected
standard, with terrible consequences.

'Prosecution of doctors for gross negligence
manslaughter is rare and the threshold for criminal prosecution is high, but
this doctor's actions were not mistakes or errors of judgment, but negligence
so serious that he has now been convicted of a criminal offence.

'Our thoughts are with the family of Mr Hughes.'

During the inquest into Mr Hughes’ death Sellu was called to give evidence and written statements and lied about when he had first seen the results of the CT scan, which he had delayed.

When his evidence on that point was examined against electronic hospital records they showed that he had first looked at the records no earlier than 9pm, not lunchtime as he had said.

The inquest was adjourned without reaching any verdict.

Sellu insisted he was not told Mr Hughes’ condition had rapidly deteriorated overnight two days before he died, but ordered emergency surgery as soon as critical results of a CT scan had arrived.

He was a senior lecturer in surgery at Imperial College from 1993 to 2000 and is an associate professor at a Florida University. He denied manslaughter and perjury.
