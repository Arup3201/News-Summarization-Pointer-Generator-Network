Denied: Leslie Van Houten was denied parole for the 20th time 44 years after going to prison for the LaBianca murders

Charles Manson's youngest follower is today set to appeal for parole for the 20th time, four decades after she helped participate in the murders which shocked America when she was just a teenager.

Leslie Van Houten faces fierce opposition to her bid for freedom, but she insists she is sorry for her crimes and is now a changed woman.

At the hearing at the California Institution for Women, a prosecutor will argue that the Tate-LaBianca murders of 1969 were so shocking that Van Houten must not be released from prison.

Her attorney, Michael Satris, said Van Houten plans to speak to the parole board on her own behalf, explaining that she has become a different person dedicated to doing good works.

'She is living a life of amends for her crime on a daily basis,' Mr Satris said. 'Everything she does now is to be of service and benefit to the world.'

He said Van Houten's value system is the complete opposite of 1969 when 'she was following the teachings of a false prophet.'

Van Houten has been commended for her work helping elderly women inmates at the California Institution for Women where she and other followers of Manson women have been incarcerated. She earned two college degrees while in custody.

Other members of Manson's murderous 'family' have lost multiple bids for parole.

One former Manson follower, Bruce Davis, was approved for parole last year only to have California's governor Jerry Brown veto the plan in March.

The Tate-La Bianca killings became among the most notorious murders of the 20th century and continue to draw public attention.

Van Houten was convicted of murder and conspiracy for her role in the slayings of wealthy grocers Leno and Rosemary LaBianca.

They were stabbed to death in August 1969, one night after Manson's followers killed actress Sharon Tate along with celebrity hairdresser Jay Sebring, coffee heiress Abigail Folger, filmmaker Voityck Frykowksi and Steven Parent.

Van Houten did not participate in the Tate killings, but went along the next night when the LaBiancas were slain in their home.

She was portrayed by her defence lawyers as the youngest and least culpable of those convicted with Manson, a young woman from a good family who had been a homecoming princess and showed promise until she became involved with drugs and was recruited into Manson's murderous cult.

Van Houten was convicted along with Manson, Susan Atkins and Patricia Krenwinkle - they were all sentenced to death, but their sentences were reduced to life in prison when the death penalty was briefly outlawed in the 1970s.

Atkins died of cancer in prison. Krenwinkle has been denied parole repeatedly and Manson, now 78, has stopped coming to parole hearings, saying that prison is his home and he wants to stay there.

Manson's lieutenant, Charles 'Tex' Watson, was convicted separately and has been denied parole many times.

Decades ago, one of the original prosecutors in the case, Stephen Kay, said there would come a time when Van Houten would be ready for parole.

But parole officials, while giving her high marks for her accomplishments in prison, have refused her bids for freedom 19 times. Her last hearing was in 2010 at which she said, 'I apologise for the pain I caused.'
