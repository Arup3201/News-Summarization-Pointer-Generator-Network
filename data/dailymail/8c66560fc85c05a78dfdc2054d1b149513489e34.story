Airline food isn't known for being tasty, and new research shows it shouldn't be known for being healthy either.

A recent survey of 12 American airlines by DietDetective.com found that low-cost airline Allegiant Air has the least healthy inflight snacks and meals, with a rating of 1.5 out of five.

The rankings were based on the calorie levels of snacks, meals and snack boxes, as well as menu innovation and the airline's improvement over last year's survey.

Packaged foods: Another low-ranking airline when it comes to healthy food is Southwest Airlines, which earned just two points on the five-point scale (pictured: a Southwest snack pack)

The survey found that on average, inflight food items contain 360 calories each - a drop from last year's 388 calories.

Las Vegas-based Allegiant lost points
 for its calorific meal offerings - including a 'deli snack pack', with 
salami slices, pita chips and SnackWell creme sandwich cookies which add up to 523 calories.

Individual snack options include a 490-calorie bag of Peanut M&M's, a four-ounce bag of Skittles, which contains 424 calories, and Blue Diamond Wasabi Almonds, which comes in at 680 calories.

The
 low-cost airline also offers up a turkey sandwich with Monterrey jack 
cheese on a pretzel roll, with 440 calories.

But travelers watching their waistlines would 
do better to opt for the 'hummus snack pack' with whole grain pita chips, which has just 210 
calories.

Another low-ranking airline when it comes to healthy food is Southwest Airlines, which 
earned just two points on the five-point scale.

Easy eats: Frontier airlines, which got 2.75 out of five stars, offers up beef jerky, fruit snacks and Animal Crackers

Food and drink: Frontier also lets you get cheaper - but not necessarily healthier - meal combos, like oatmeal and coffee (left) or chips and ale (right)

According
 to the Southwest website, they offer various packaged snacks like Ritz 
crackers, Fig Newtons and Wheat Thins, with little to no nutritional 
value.

On the other end of the spectrum is Virgin America, which earned four out of five stars for its in-flight meal service.

A
 roasted pear and arugula salad, for instance, has just 310 calories, 
and the airline offers 'Travel Light' options like a spicy southwestern 
wrap or a bowl of granola with fruit and yogurt.

Virgin America also won points for making meals' nutritional values readily available to flyers.

Nutrition: Alaska Air ranked third best for its reasonably balanced meals

Choices: Flyers on Alaska Air can choose meals including a Texas-style barbeque pork sandwich (left) or a Reuben sandwich, with Swiss cheese and sauerkraut (right)

The next best airline for healthy food is Air Canada, which had the same score as Virgin American with 4.5 points.

The
 snack menu includes carrots with ranch dressing, pretzels and hummus, 
fruit and chocolate, and some of the meals are shepherd's pie, a chicken
 wrap and a vegetarian sandwich.

Virgin America spokeswoman Patricia Condon told USA Today: 'Our guests tell us regularly that they 
want lighter options.

'As the only airline headquartered in 
California, we take a lot of pride in offering a menu that features not 
only the best quality ingredients, but that also offers healthy options 
to busy travelers on the go.'

Winner: Virgin America was deemed the healthiest airline when it comes to inflight food

Top choice: 'We take a lot of pride in offering a menu that features not only the best quality ingredients, but that also offers healthy options to busy travelers on the go,' said a Virgin America spokesperson

Meanwhile, an Allegiant spokesperson explained that the airline offers unhealthy snacks because it's what customers want.

'Our onboard food offerings are simply a reflection of passenger demand,' said Julian Ralenkotter.

'In the past, we have experimented with healthier options, such as hummus and granola bars. Those items most frequently purchased by our passengers have remained on our menu, while less popular options were dropped.'
