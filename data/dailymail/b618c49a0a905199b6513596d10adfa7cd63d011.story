A 65-year-old man has died in France from a deadly new SARS-like virus which health officials are warning is now a global threat.

The unnamed victim died at Hopital Roger Salengro in Lille after returning from a trip to Dubai in April.

It brings the death toll from the strain of novel coronavirus to 24 out of 44 confirmed cases.

The man's hospital roommate also fell ill and remains isolated and in intensive care.

The fatality comes as the World Health Organisation warned that the disease, first identified in humans in September, is now their greatest global concern.

The strain is related to SARS, which killed some 800 people in a global epidemic in 2003. Dr. Margaret Chan, head of the WHO, singled out the illness in a speech on Monday in Geneva.

'We understand too little about this virus when viewed against the magnitude of its potential threat,' Chan said at the annual WHO meeting.

'We do not know where the virus hides in nature. We do not know how people are getting infected. Until we answer these questions, we are empty-handed when it comes to prevention. These are alarm bells. And we must respond.'

She said the 'novel coronavirus... is a threat to the entire world.'

WHO said in an update earlier this month that 20 of the 40 confirmed cases of the disease have ended in death. Most of those infected since the virus was identified last year had traveled to Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Jordan or Pakistan. There also have been cases in Britain and Germany.

Saudi Arabia accounts for the majority of confirmed cases, which stands at 33, according to WHO officials. Tunisia last week became the ninth country in which the virus has been confirmed.

It is believed the disease is transmitted mainly from person-to-person contact, but so far does not spread easily among larger communities.

Authorities believe initial transmission of the virus was from animal to human but have yet to identify the animal sources.

French authorities earlier this month began handing out leaflets at airports to travellers to the Middle East advising them to wash their hands frequently and limit contact with animals.

The French victim had been in hospital for more than a month, spending the last 20 days in a room of the intensive care unit of the hospital where he was on life-support systems.

Speaking about the death of the patient from the virus, French health minister Marisol Touraine said 'There is no cause for additional concern.'
