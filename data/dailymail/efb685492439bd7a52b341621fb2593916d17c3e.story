Former Chelsea goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini believes Petr Cech may decide to leave Stamford Bridge in January if he fails to win back his first-team spot.

Cech has had to make do with a spot on the substitutes' bench during Chelsea's first two games of the season as Jose Mourinho has instead opted to start with Thibaut Courtois in goal.

And Cudicini, who lost his place to Cech during his time in west London, has tipped his former rival to become disillusioned with life at Chelsea if he continues to be overlooked by Mourinho.

Cudicini, speaking to the London Evening Standard, said on Chelsea's current goalkeeper situation: 'I decided to stay but that doesn’t mean Petr will do the same. Every situation is different. I was the No 1 for three years when Petr arrived but I didn’t have the same pedigree Petr has now.

'He can go anywhere. Any team in the world will take him but it was different for me. A goalkeeper of his calibre will try to win the No 1 jersey back but if Courtois does his job well and keeps it, then I don’t think that Petr will stay.

'It might be in January, it might be the end of the year but I don’t see him staying. That’s my idea but I might be wrong.'
