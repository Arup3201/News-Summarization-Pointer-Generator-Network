An earthquake with a magnitude of 3.8 hit North Wales this morning and caused 'intense shaking'.

Officials said the epicentre was in the Irish Sea, just 10 miles off the coast from the town of Abersoch, Gwynedd.

The quake, which struck at 4.15am, was 
felt over a 90 mile radius in areas as far apart as Southport, in 
Merseyside, Dublin, in Ireland, and Douglas, Isle of Man.

Although thousands of people are thought to have been woken up by the rumbling this morning, it is not thought to have caused any significant damage.

Earthquake: The quake was felt at 4.16am today (3.16am in coordinated universal time) just off the coast of north Wales

The biggest earthquake ever recorded in Britain with a magnitude of 5.4 stuck in the same area in the Llyn Peninsula in 1984.

That was 250 times as big and caused chimney stacks to topple, the British Geological Survey (BGS) said.

Today an aftershock with a magnitude of 1.7 was measured four minutes later at 4.20am but it was so small that only one person has so far reported feeling it.

David Galloway, a seismologist with the BGS, said today: 'We have had 193 reports from people who felt the earthquake already but that number is going up all the time.

'A couple of those reports are from Dublin, some from Douglas on the Isle of Man, and some in Southport.

'We don't expect a quake of this size to cause any damage. A few people might say there were cracks to plaster but there won't be any structural damage.

'With the quake in 1984 there were reports of chimneys coming off rooftops but that earthquake was 250 times as big with a magnitude of 5.4.

'To put it in context, the earthquake which hit Japan in March 2011 with a magnitude of 9.0 was 67million times as big.'

Quake: The ground shook in the Llyn Peninsula at around 4.15am today. The epicentre was in the Irish Sea, around 10 miles off the coast

A report by the BGS said that people reported 'gradually grew louder. Classic underground train passing sensation' and 'woke the household any many neighbours'.

Mother Eirian Rees, 48, said: 'The earthquake woke me up in the night from a deep sleep.

'The house was shaking - I thought my two boys were running around wildly as the floor was shaking and rumbling.

'It was also very noisy and unreal, my heart was beating and it felt like it lasted quite a long time.'

Peter McShane, of Menai Bridge, Isle of Anglesey, told the BBC: 'I woke up, I don't why looked at the clock it was 4.15am and suddenly the rumbling started.

'The one in 1984 was considerably more intense in that I remember in the house in the afternoon when one of them sort of started it sort of blurred your vision and things fell off your bookcase.

'This one was nothing alarming.'

The Irish National Seismic Network said tremors were felt in counties in south-east Ireland and its seismic stations in Valentia off the south-west coast, Donegal and Galway all recorded the earthquake.

Tom Blake, INSN director and from the school of cosmic physics in the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, said there has been a significant increase in seismic activity in the area in recent months.

'It is unlikely that the magnitude of todayâ€™s earthquake will be exceeded in the Irish Sea in the coming days but aftershocks can be expected in the hours and days ahead, although many will be too weak to be felt,' he said.

There was a far smaller earthquake in Caernarfon Bay, Gwynedd, on February 7 this year, which had a magnitude of 2.3.

In February 2008 the last significant earthquake in Britain hit Market Rasen, Lincolnshire, with a magnitude of 5.2.
