He left his family to train with extremists in Syria.

Now British jihadist Nasser Muthana has threatened to use his terror ‘skills’ when he returns to the UK.

In a chilling online message, the 20-year-old unveiled a photograph of what is thought to be a collection of improvised explosive devices or IEDs. Underneath the image, he wrote: ‘So the UK is afraid I come back with the skills I’ve gained.’

Messages: Cardiff Jihadist Nasser Muthana has tweeted that the UK should be 'afraid' about the skills he has learned while fighting for ISIS should he return

Boastful: The Briton, who was planning to become a doctor, posted this picture of home made bombs 

Violent: Muthana also tweeted a picture of a weapon that he hoped would help decapitate an enemy

He also wrote about decapitating his enemies alongside a  picture of a chain-like weapon.

Muthana
 was exposed as a  terrorist in training after he appeared in a 
recruitment video for insurgent group ISIS, devastating the family he 
left behind in Cardiff.

Formerly
 a prospective medical student, he was joined in Syria by his younger 
brother Aseel, 17, who has now spoken of his willingness to die 
fighting.

The Muthana 
brothers, who grew up in Cardiff after their father moved there from 
Yemen as a teenager, are among an estimated 500 young men from  Britain 
who have flown to Syria to join the rebels.

Last
 week, Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick said 
Muslim communities in Britain were guilty of ‘complacency and passivity’
 over the threat from home-grown jihadists. Experts have also warned of 
the danger posed by those who fight overseas, then return to Britain.

'Jihad is obligatory': British ISIS fighter Aseel Muthana, right, followed his brother Nasser, left, to Syria and says he is 'willing to die' in Syria and won't come home to the UK

Nasser’s
 photograph appears to show around 15 homemade IEDs packed inside metal 
 containers hidden behind what looks like a garage door.

His
 Twitter profile also contains a photograph showing the chain-like 
weapon thought to have been taken from an enemy Shia Muslim – and a plan
 to behead the captive fighter. The accompanying message says: ‘Look 
what we found on this shi’i, glad tidings we’ll make sure his head is 
detachable.’ Nasser describes himself as a ‘soldier of the Islamic State
 of Iraq and Sham [ISIS]’ on the social networking site. His profile 
explains his beliefs are based on ‘a book that guides and a sword that 
supports it’.

Yesterday, his devastated father Ahmed Muthana said: ‘This is not the son I know. Maybe if they have a heart they’ll come back.

‘What
 they are doing or posting online, they are being told to by the people 
with the guns who feed them, look after them and have control over them.
 They are trapped in the situation and that makes it hard for them to 
come back or leave the place.

Interview: The BBC have traced Aseel Muthana to Syria, where he has internet access, and he raved about jihad and also revelled in 'glad tidings' when an enemy was beheaded

‘I think they are being forced into posting these things because my kids are not like this.’

The 57-year-old added: ‘I haven’t had any contact with either of my sons since they left.

‘I don’t want to speak to them. If they want to speak to me they can reach me but I’m not going to ask them to speak.’

Another of Mr Muthana’s four sons, Aseel, also spoke of his devotion to the ISIS cause.

In
 an online conversation with the makers of a BBC Wales documentary 
broadcast last night, he claimed there were ‘loads’ of other men from 
Britain who have joined the group. Asked whether he realised he would be
 arrested if he returned to the UK, he replied: ‘Yes, most probably’, 
adding: ‘Jihad is obligatory.’ Quizzed about any regrets he had over 
leaving Britain, he said: ‘Nope, I can say I am willing to die but Allah
 knows the truth.’

Aseel 
described making friends with other British jihadists who had travelled 
to Syria to join ISIS. He told the Week In Week Out documentary that 
when his brother Naseer left home his family was devastated.

Asked
 to defend the brutal methods used by ISIS, he said simply: ‘If the 
state (ISIS) uses Sharia methods, I am 100 per cent pro.’ And when asked
 whether there was anything he missed about home, he said: ‘I don’t miss
 much. I have a new life here but wouldn’t mind seeing my family live 
here with me.’

Others in 
the ISIS recruitment video that emerged last month have been identified 
as fellow Cardiff youth Reyaad Khan, 20, and Aberdeen-raised Abdul Raqib
 Amin, 25.

Yesterday, 
another teenager from Cardiff was arrested on suspicion of terror 
offences. The 18-year-old man was seized for allegedly assisting in the 
preparation of an act of terrorism.

Meanwhile, counter-terrorism officers raided a dozen properties yesterday in West London and Watford, Hertfordshire.

A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of fraud by false representation and terrorist fundraising offences.
