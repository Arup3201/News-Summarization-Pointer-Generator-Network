Snared: Suspected paedophile Walter Lee Williams, 64, who was arrested in Mexico yesterday after he was named one of the FBI's Ten Most Wanted

A former professor at the University of Southern California suspected sexually abusing young boys and producing child pornography was yesterday arrested in Mexico.

Walter Lee Williams, 64, was captured yesterday evening while drinking coffee near a park in the beach town of Playa del Carmen, on the country's Carribean coast.

He was on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list for charges of sexual exploitation of children and travelling abroad for the purpose of engaging in sexual acts with children.

Local prosecutor Gaspar Armando Garcia Torres said it wasn't clear how long Williams had been living in Playa del Carmen.

The fugitive also had an address in nearby Cancun, said the prosecutor, where he was taken and turned over to Mexican immigration officials.

Mr Garcia did not say whether Williams is suspected of committing any crimes in Mexico.

A federal arrest warrant was issued for the former Palm Springs, California, resident in Los Angeles in April, according to the FBI website.

The indictment alleges Williams travelled from Los Angeles to the Philippines in January 2011 to engage in sex acts with two 14-year-old boys he met online in 2010, said the U.S. Department of Justice.

While in the country he allegedly engaged in sex acts with both boys and produced sexually explicit photos of one of the boys.

The paedophile suspect fled the Los Angeles area approximately one week after returning from the Philippines, the DoJ added.

Williams was until 2011 a tenured professor studying gender development at the University of Southern California. He was also affiliated with the Buddhist Universal Association of Los Angeles, California, according to the FBI.

'Williams has an extensive history of travel throughout the South East Asia region, specifically the Philippines,' the FBI said. 'He has reportedly resided in Indonesia, Polynesia and Thailand.'

The FBI had only added Williams to its Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list on Monday.

In a video about Williams posted on the FBI's website to bring attention to the case, Special Agent Jeff Yesenky said: 'I analysed the computers and the camera that belong to Williams and found child pornography.'

'He preys on the most vulnerable children,' Yesensky added.
