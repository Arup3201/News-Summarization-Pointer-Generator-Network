A Spanish photographer has created a collection of pictures featuring animals dressed in human clothing.

Miguel Vallinas who is based in Madrid, has called the project Segundas Pieles which means Second Skins.

But rather than just creating a collection of funny pictures, Vallinas tries to imagine which clothes the animals would choose for themselves if they could.

The collection called Segundas Pieles, or Second Skins, not only attributes clothes to the animals but imagines what kinds of personalities they would have

A stag is depicted looking relaxed in an open shirt and jacket in the collection where Vallinas has imagined which clothes the animals would choose for themselves if given the choice

A doe is depicted in the personality Vallinas has imagined for her, wearing a mini skirt and knee high leather boots

A swan is shown in ballerina pumps and a floaty skirt in a possible nod to its ballet roots with Swan Lake

Among the featured animals is a blazer bearing stag, a mini-skirted doe and a vulture wearing a parka jacket.

The
 animals appear to assume stereotypical characters, with the wise owl 
keeping warm in a jumper and the glamorous, exotic zebra sporting a fur 
trimmed, leather sleeved coat.

The artist looks at a strange variety of animals including a few species of bird such as bustards, flamingos and vultures.

The project is a possible continuation of the photographer's previous collection, Pieles (skins).

A notably glamorous zebra sports a fur-lined coat in the bizarre collection of photos

The wise owl: Vallinas suggests the owl would opt for a cosy jumper to keep warm while crooning the night skies

Flamingo pink: The creature known for its flamboyant colour and elegance is shown in a chic and feminine outfit

A roe deer in a sherling jacket is shown with his hands in his pockets

The two series could be linked with the first featuring several portraits of people which aim to investigate the internal aspects of human life by examining a collection of men dressed in different work uniforms.Â 

The project was designed to expose the human condition but has instead been criticised for featuring men only.

The men pose in the characters of firemen, construction workers, bin men, doctors and barbers.

Segundas Pieles tries to imagine how animals would express their personalities if they had the ability to do so themselves.

A donkey is shown in dark clothing, perhaps suggesting tiredness after a lifetime of work

Boring bustard: The bustard bird is depicted in plain clothing and adopts a stiff stance

Eagle eye: The eagle is portrayed in sharp tailoring wearing a polo-neck jumper

Rooster rules: A rooster shown in a checked blazer and skinny jeans
