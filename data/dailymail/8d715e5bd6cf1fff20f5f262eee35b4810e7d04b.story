The son of a world-class jazz musician has been jailed after attacking a cyclist who clipped the wing mirror of his car. 

Daniel Watkiss, the son of Cleveland Watkiss, was driving through Stoke Newington, east London, when he tried to overtake cyclist James Falle last July. 

When the victim accidentally touched his wing mirror while signalling for him to move past, the 30-year-old sped his BMW round and stopped suddenly in front of the bike.

Cleveland Watkiss has been hailed as Britain's best jazz singer. The vocalist 'broke down' in court as his son's sentence was read out 

After demanding £50 to pay for the 'damage', Watkiss 'grabbed' the cyclist by the helmet before hitting him in the face.

He was sentenced to 18 months in prison at Snaresbrook Crown Court yesterday after being found guilty of dangerous driving and assault by beating.  

His father, who has performed with Bob Dylan, Stevie Wonder and Keith Richards among others, broke down in tears as his sentence was read out.  

The court heard how Watkiss 'strangled' the cyclist by gripping the strap of his helmet so tightly.

Giving evidence, Mr Falle described falling off his bike when the father-of-one swung his luxury car in front of him and braked suddenly. 

'The next thing I knew he had grabbed my helmet and pulled me across my bike and into the road.

‘The strap on my helmet was strangling me; I couldn't breathe at this stage. I was trying to undo the helmet with one hand, but that was impossible while I was still being dragged forward,' he said. 

Watkiss started rifling through the man's pockets before trying to force him to produce his wallet to pay for the mirror which was not damaged, according to witnesses.

Mr Falle was then struck across the face and neck before his attacker sped off, leaving him with bloody knees, cuts and bruises. 

Defence agent Liam Loughlin said: 'The reason he pleaded not guilty is that he was simply terrified of going to prison.'

He added Watkiss has to provide for his 10-year-old son who has special educational needs, and would probably lose his job as a youth worker in the London Borough of Hackney if he went to prison.

He added: ‘He’s remorseful and he puts it down to a moment of madness.’

Passing a sentence of 18 months in prison and a two year driving ban Judge Patricia Lees said: 'Mr Falle is an experienced cyclist and he is used to cycling in London, he was plainly not trying to aggravate the driver behind him.’

‘You demanded restitution for the wing mirror, it was a nonsense, it was not damaged, and even if it had been there is no way a wing mirror costs £50.

‘The only explanation you could give was that you were planning on doing the work yourself and would need to buy parts.’

‘It seems to me this offences are so serious that only an immediate custodial sentence is justified.

‘But because of you family matters I have reduced your sentence to shorter than you deserve.’

Cleveland Watkiss from Hackney, east London, has been hailed in the past as Britain's best male jazz singer. 

Born to Jamaican parents as one of nine children, the 54-year-old won best vocalist in the 2010 London Jazz Awards and was named best vocalist in the Wire/Guardian Jazz Awards for three years in a row. 

After studying at the London School of Singing with an opera coach, Watkiss released five solo albums before teaching musical workshops across London. 

He has performed with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra as well as Bob Dylan, Stevie Wonder, Keith Richards and pop stars such as Robbie Williams. 

Watkiss was hand picked to open two of the worlds greatest female jazz vocalists Cassandra Wilson and Abbey Lincoln.

Recently he has put together a jazz quarter and continues to perform around London and the rest of the world. 

He was chosen to launch the Cultural Olympiad by Sebastian Coe ahead of the 2012 Games in a bid to promote London's culture alongside sport.
