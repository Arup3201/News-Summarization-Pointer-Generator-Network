Michael Carrick hopes Manchester United can follow up their 3-0 win against Hull by beating Stoke at Old Trafford on Tuesday.

The midfielder, who has started Manchester United's last three games following his return from injury, was happy with his side's performance against the Tigers.

However he has urged his team-mates to follow up their impressive victory against Steve Bruce's side by claiming all three points in midweek.

Carrick, speaking to MUTV, said: 'It was a good performance and a good win.

'We controlled the game from the start and played some really good football. Hopefully they'll be more of the same on Tuesday.

'Our downfall this season is that we've had to change the team too much and we haven't had a consistent run with this squad. Hopefully that will change now and it's nice to have a game so quick so we can keep that momentum going.

'It's been strange in some ways [having no midweek games] compared to what we've been used to over the years but it's something that we've got to grips with. It was a good performance and win against Hull but it's behind us now and our focus is on Tuesday.'

The 33-year-old also lavished praise on team-mate Robin van Persie following the Dutchman's first goal for his club in just over a month.

Carrick added: 'It was some strike! It was only really half a chance, but he's controlled it and smashed it into the top corner.

'It's great when the boys up front are creating chances and scoring goals. If we can do what we did on Saturday on a more regular basis we'll be a real threat.'
