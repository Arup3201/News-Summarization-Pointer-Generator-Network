History repeated itself on Monday as England were forced to take Commonwealth Games silver in the team table tennis at Glasgow 2014.

Just like in Delhi four years ago, Singapore were their conquerors with the reigning champions taking the gold with a 3-1 victory.

Time proved no healer for Andrew Baggaley, Paul Drinkhall and Liam Pitchford as they were beaten at Scotstoun, with a poor start coming back to haunt them.

Drinkhall had the perfect chance to lay down an early marker as he led Jian Zhan 1-0 and 2-1 but he ended up losing 3-2, before Pitchford was brushed aside 3-0 by Ning Gao.

Salvation appeared to be at hand as Baggaley and Drinkhall ripped through their doubles match to make it 2-1 overall but, when Zhan dispatched Baggaley 3-0 in 24 minutes, the game was up.

It was not a case of twice bitten thrice shy for Drinkhall, though, who remains intent on cracking the code in the Commonwealth team event.

'We are there or thereabouts, it's just a couple of points either way but we'll be back in four years and this will only make us more determined,' he said.

'This is a much stronger Singapore team than four years ago. They've brought in two new players who were not eligible in Delhi and they really pushed on.

'I think we've closed the gap on Singapore. These guys are very experienced, some of them are ex-Chinese national team members.

'We are just getting better and better and while they are coming to the end of their career, we are just starting to peak.'

All three English players now head into the singles and doubles competition and Drinkhall is ready for that.

'I'm playing well. I've come into the tournament with confidence. I wasn't playing at my best at the start but I've slowly got into it and I can still get better,' he said.

'I really think there are three medals for me and I really want one of those golds and I believe we can medal in every event. I know we can beat every pair in the doubles.'
