Commenting on the crash, California Highway Patrol Officer James Smith said: 'Fog is a contributing factor

'If there had more visibility, the drivers may have seen each other sooner. 

'They could have slowed down, which would have produced less injury - or they might have completely avoided the collision. 

'We want to make sure that motorists drive at speeds that are safe given the conditions.' 

One-way traffic control was implemented as the scene was cleared. Names of the victims have not yet been released.
