Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak is now one step closer to becoming an Australian citizen.

The multi-millionaire California native was officially granted permanent residency status by the Aussie government over the weekend thanks to his status as a distinguished person.

'Woz' as he's affectionately known says he'll likely pursue full Australian citizenship when his busy travel schedule finally settles down.

'It took a long time and cost some money, but we have done it for our entire family, so we can all reside here,' Woz told Australian Financial Review.

Wozniak has a son who who's married to an Aussie and lives in Sydney, notes the International Business Times. 

He also teaches classes at the University of Technology in Sydney, where he became an adjunct professor after the school extended him an invitation to work there. 

According to the AFR, Woz first applied for citizenship back in 2012 when he cited the country's rollout of a national broadband network among his reasons for wanting a new passport.

He's since made arrangements to have more aspects of his day-to-day life moved Down Under.

Wozniak still keeps speaking engagements worldwide, prohibiting him from residing in Australia full-time. But when things slow down, Woz says he intends to settle in Australia for the remainder of his days

For now, his international speaking arrangements prevent him from spending all his time in the far off country.

When things settle down, he says he wants to call Australia home.

'I want to be a distinguished part of this country and some day I may say I lived and died an Australian, and that would be a really nice thing to be able to say. No country is perfect, but I like a lot of things about this place,' he said.

More specifically, Woz says its the little island of Tasmania south of Melbourne that he'd like to call home.

'The Premier of Tasmania actually called us at our home and offered to show us around if we were ever there. Hopefully in the next few days we can get there, as I really like the idea of cooler weather,' he said.
