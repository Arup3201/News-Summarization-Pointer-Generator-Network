Siem de Jong's injury-wrecked season has been cut short after John Carver confirmed the midfielder will return for pre-season training - following his recovery from a collapsed lung. 

The former Ajax captain who signed for £6million in the summer will miss the remaining ten games, having only made two appearances for the entire season. 

The Newcastle boss assured the De Jong that he wouldn't be rushed back from such a serious injury.

He said: 'Siem will be back in pre-season. It is one of those we just need to test the water with and see how he is. I've said from the start there's definitely no pressure on him.'

Brought in by the cub to add some class and technical ability, the Dutchman managed only one start before suffering a serious thigh injury.

De Jong's capture was seen as somewhat of a coup by the club and very much whetted the appetite of the Newcastle fans.

But a series of injuries and bad luck have seen the supporters disappointed, with many labeling the club vice-captain a flop.

The Dutchman, who has six caps to his name, made a promising start during pre-season after signing and Carver is disappointed he won't be able to use him.

He added: 'The bits we saw from him in pre-season - he scored a couple of goals and his link-up play - were good. Unfortunately we're not going to get that.'

Following news of Papiss Cisse's seven-game ban after spitting at Manchester United's Jonny Evans, the Newcastle boss will no doubt have loved to have De Jong fit and playing, with Ayoze Perez, Emmanuel Riviere and Adam Armstrong his only recognised strikers.
