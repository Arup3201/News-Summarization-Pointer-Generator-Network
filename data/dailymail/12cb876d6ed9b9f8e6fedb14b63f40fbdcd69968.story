Vice President Joe Biden came clean on Thursday about his inability to keep a straight face during President Barack Obama's State of the Union addresses.

He told a gathering of the U.S. Conference of Mayors that he had told his wife Jill,'You know that camera is on the whole time. ... It's hard to keep the appropriate look.'

'And she said, "Oh, you're kidding",' he recalled.

'Welcome to the "Supportive Wife’s Club",' Mrs. Biden quipped.

The vice president may look like he's about to shave his neck, but he was just reacting to something Barack Obama said on Tuesday during the State of the Union address

Every year when the president takes center-stage in the House of Representatives, the House speaker and vice president sit behind him on the dais – right within the camera shots of every news network around the world.

While Speaker John Boehner is known for stone-like facial consistency, though, Biden can go through a range of expressions worthy of an Oscar-winning performance.

Sacramento, California Mayor Kevin Johnson introduced him before he spoke.

'The president has a teleprompter,' Johnson said. 'There's no chance he's going to mess up too bad.'

'The real pressure is on the vice president, who in every single TV shot is responsible for assuring that he has the appropriate reaction.' 

While Johnson spoke, photos of Biden during Tuesday's address flashed on a giant TV screen.

'I tell you what, man,' the vice president said when he took the stage. 'There's nothing like sarcasm to know you're welcome. You know what I mean?'

Biden didn't disappoint on Thursday either: He contorted his face in a goofy impersonation of his wife for good measure.

'She said, "How many of your speeches have I heard multiple times?"' he said. 'And I go, "Yeah, isn't that wonderful?";

Cue the applause.

'I have an increased appreciation for spouses, male and female, of elected officials,' Biden said.
