Steven Gerrard has named his best Liverpool XI of players he has played alongside, including the likes of Luis Suarez, Xabi Alonso and Jamie Carragher... and, of course, himself. 

In an interview with GQ magazine, the Reds captain and legend also named the likes of Fernando Torres, previous skipper Sami Hyypia and Javier Mascherano in the team.

Making up the numbers were keeper Pepe Reina, left-back John Arne Riise, right-back Glen Johnson, and midfielder Dietmar Hamaan.

Gerrard also declared that he considers Jose Enrique to be the worst-dressed player currently at the club, saying that the Spanish full-back has 'actually got himself down as a bit of a style icon, but it all just goes wrong for him.'

And he revealed that his signature dish in the kitchen is a 'a little goat's cheese pasta number', as well as his greatest interest outside of football being golf.

Naturally, the Liverpool legend also admitted that he would like to manage the club one day, but did surprisingly he is currently reading Roy Keane's book!

Gerrard is set to return to the starting line-up as the Reds are set to face Chelsea in the Premier League's lunchtime kick-off on Saturday.
