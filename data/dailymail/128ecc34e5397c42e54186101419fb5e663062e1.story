Iain Duncan Smith is threatening a new Coalition row by demanding the immediate introduction of a tax break for married couples.

The Work and Pensions Secretary wants George Osborne to make the change in next year’s Budget to show the Government is serious about promoting marriage.

He is said to have warned David Cameron the public will dismiss the idea – a key Tory manifesto pledge – as tokenism if its introduction is delayed any longer.

There are also fears that the pledge, which the Prime Minister has said will be honoured by 2015, could fall by the wayside altogether unless it is implemented soon.

But he faces opposition from Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, who has accused the Tories of trying to ‘preserve in aspic a 1950s model of suit-wearing, bread-winning dad and aproned, home-making mother’.

Mr Cameron championed the idea of a marriage tax break when in opposition, although the proposal was watered down to the point where it would be worth only about £150 a year to most.

He said encouraging marriage would help more couples stay together and produce greater stability for children.

The move is bitterly opposed by the Lib Dems, who argue it is wrong to favour marriage over cohabitation. The Coalition agreement allows them to abstain on any vote on the issue, and gives priority to their tax plan of raising the income tax threshold to £10,000.

Mr Duncan Smith received heavyweight support yesterday from the Bishop of Chester. Peter Forster said recognition of marriage in the tax system would send a ‘powerful symbolic message from government into society – and say something important about the wider importance of marriage to society’.

‘Good marriages are not just a benefit for the couple themselves, and their children, but serve to strengthen the wider society of which they are a part,’ he said.

‘A strong respect for marriage  will actually support single parents, and others who have the care  of children.’

Speaking in a House of Lords debate on child development, the bishop urged ministers to act without delay, adding: ‘Given the associated IT changes which would be required, if it isn’t introduced in the next Budget, I fear it will be left as an unfulfilled pledge when we get to the next election.’

Former Tory lord chancellor Lord Mackay of Clashfern also urged the Chancellor to act swiftly in the interests of children.

‘There is plenty of evidence that the institution of marriage is the best possible environment for bringing up children,’ he told peers.

‘But time is running out. It is highly important that the Government should fulfil the commitment.’

Ministers have not specified exactly how the pledge to recognise marriage in the tax system by 2015 will be implemented.
