Mothers with full-time jobs spend four months of the year working to cover their childcare costs, according to research.

They must work for 17 weeks to raise enough money to pay the nursery or childminder as fees spiral.

Annual bills for a full-time place have reached £24,000 at the country’s most expensive nurseries – on a par with the fees charged by prestigious boarding schools.

Mothers with a full-time job need to work for up to four months of the year just to break even on their childcare costs

But growing numbers of women are 
accepting the mounting charges to bring in more money for their families
as the cost of living rises and house prices remain high.

Research by trust fund provider Family
Investments found families pay £7,127 a year on average for a full-time
place at a day nursery or childminder for only one child.

A mother would need to work for 17 weeks on average to break even and recoup these costs.

But the analysis found sharp regional 
variations, with mothers in the South West and South East having to work
the longest to cover their costs.

Those in the South West pay £7,228 on
average per year for childcare but earn £10.72 an hour, meaning they 
must work for 18.6 weeks to cover the charges. In the South East, women must work for 17.9 weeks to break even.

West Midlands

North West

Mothers living in the North tend to need to work for a week less a year than those living in the South of England to break even on their childcare costs

Although those in London face the 
highest annual childcare costs, at £9,283 per year on average, they also
have the highest wages, earning £15.07 an hour, meaning they must work 
for 16.9 weeks to cover childcare.

Mothers in the south of England tend 
to have to work one week more than those in the north to recoup care 
costs – but those in Yorkshire and Humberside had to work for an 
above-average 17.7 weeks.

Kate Moore, of Family Investments, said: 
‘These figures highlight the very significant costs mums face if they 
choose to return to work after maternity leave and the fact that they 
will spend up to four months of the year simply working towards these 
costs.

‘Mums can get up to 15 hours of care 
per week for free once their child turns three, but for the first couple
of years parents must saddle these costs on their own.

‘What really jumps out from these figures is both the scale of the costs involved and the disparities in local affordability.’

The latest research is based on 
mothers who work a 36.3 hour week and receive no help from Government 
schemes to help working parents, such as tax credits.

It also assumed parents were not accepting childcare vouchers, which allow them to pay for childcare out of pre-tax wages.

Previous studies have found that working mothers in Britain face some of the highest childcare costs in the developed world.

Charities claim the tax and benefits system is skewed to make childcare costs a particular burden for middle-income families.

The Mail revealed last month that, 
according to the latest census figures, the stay-at-home mother is 
becoming consigned to history.

Fewer than one in ten women of working
age are stay-at-home mothers, down from 12 per cent in 2002 and a 
complete reversal on the 1970s, where most women with young families 
stayed at home.

But a survey of new mothers by analyst Mintel suggests the tide may be turning amid a lack of affordable childcare places.

It found that the proportion of 
mothers deciding to stay at home rather than return to work has surged 
from 18 to 24 per cent in only a year.

Ina Mitskavets, of Mintel, said: 
‘Affordability of childcare, or lack of, is keeping lower-income mums 
and those with more children at home.’

But she added that the rising cost of 
living continued to place women under enormous pressure to go back to 
work when their babies are very young.

‘Job security is highly prized in the 
current climate of uncertainty with many mothers returning to work 
within the 12 months that their job has to be legally held open for 
them,’ she said.

The Coalition has launched a commission, which is due to report soon, to recommend ways to overhaul the childcare system.
