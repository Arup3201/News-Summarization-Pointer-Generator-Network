Two scientific papers which claimed statins can do more harm than good in patients with a low risk of heart disease should not be withdrawn, an investigation has found.

The articles, published last year in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), caused controversy by suggesting that the benefits of the cholesterol-lowering drugs in healthier patients did not outweigh the risks of side effects.

Professor Sir Rory Collins, co-director of the Clinical Trials Research Unit at Oxford University, said the papers overstated the risks of statins 20-fold, and could put lives at risk by discouraging patients from taking them.

But an independent panel set up by the BMJ found there were no grounds for retraction.

The journal did withdraw the claim that one in five people taking statins suffers side effects, but said the two papers as a whole ‘enhanced scientific debate on a topical issue’. 

Reported side effects of the drugs include type 2 diabetes and muscular pain.

Professor Collins criticised the decision not to retract the papers, and said in his experience side effects are reported by less than 1 per cent of patients.

A recent study of 27 trials, led by Professor Collins, concluded that even low-risk patients can benefit from statins. 

This led NHS watchdog Nice to last month recommend much wider use.

Between five and ten million Britons currently take the drugs.
