Neymar was left in tears after the Brazil team invited a disabled boy onto the pitch to meet his heroes during training on Thursday.

The fan showed off his juggling skills to an astonished David Luiz, before the hosts gathered round the boy to hear a message.

Barcelona star Neymar was visibly moved by young boy, and was patted on the back by team-mate Thiago Silva as the Brazil players got on with training.

Later in the day, the Brazil team took to the beach at their training complex in Teresopolis, near Rio de Janeiro, for a spot of football-volleyball.

Scolari is '100 per cent convinced' he will be the first man to guide Brazil to World Cup glory on home turf.

The well-travelled coach, known as 'Big Phil' to Chelsea fans, is back in the job which made him famous and promising the Selecao will be crowned world champions for the sixth time on July 13.

'There is no pressure on Brazil,' he said. 'Brazil are not under pressure to be the world champions.

'Brazil will be the champions.

'I wouldn't have accepted the Brazil job if I didn't think we could win the World Cup. I wouldn't be leading the team I'd be sitting at home.

'I took this job because I'm 100 per cent convinced that I will win the World Cup with Brazil.'

Can't wait: Neymar and Brazil get their campaign underway in Sao Paulo against Croatia on June 12
