As Monday turns to Tuesday the U.S. government will lose its authority to spend money on non-essential services, unless House Republicans, Senate Democrats and the Democrat occupying 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue strike a budget deal that hinges on the future of President Obama's controversial health insurance overhaul.

House GOP leaders offered and passed 
last week a budget resolution that would fund the government, but 
without providing money for Obamacare. But now Republicans are working 
on a compromise measure that would delay the health care law's 
implementation for a year instead.A competing plan would chip away at Obamacare more modestly by eliminating a widely reviled new 2.3 per cent tax on medical devices.

'None of this is acceptable,' White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Monday. 'This is blatant extortion.'

A federal government shutdown, something Washington hasn't seen since 1995, would paradoxically not cancel Tuesday's planned rollout of health care exchanges that President Obama claims will permit millions of Americans to lower their health insurance costs.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

President Obama said after Monday's meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he was hoping to avert a government shutdown but had no intention of bending on his position

Speaker of the House John Boehner parried a Senate-passed temporary budget bill that wouldn't defund the Obamacare law, and is now angling for a one-year pause in the law's implementation instead as a halfway measure

But the White House insists that the president will not sit down to discus any deal that rolls back parts of his Obamacare system.

The U.S. Senate has declined to vote on the GOP's original proposal, and shows no sign that it will embrace the GOP's halfway measure.

The House worked past midnight Saturday to pass its legislation, but the Senate sat shuttered all weekend. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid kept his chamber's Monday morning schedule empty too, choosing to call senators back only at 2:00 p.m. to send the House a 'clean' budget that doesn't change Obamacare at all.

By that time, Republicans complained in a Sunday press conference, Democrats would have successfully 'run out the clock' on the budget stalemate, forcing the hot potato back into the GOP's hands as midnight approaches.

The Senate moved quickly as expected Monday afternoon, voting 56-44 strictly along party lines to strip the House Republicans' Obamacare-related language out of the budget resolution and send it back.

The Obama administration, while refusing to negotiate, has insisted that Republicans deserve all of Americans' blame if government ceases to function.

'As of now,' White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Monday afternoon, 'it is up to the House of Representatives to decide whether they want to shut down the government in order to make an ideological point.'

Carney said president would not bow to 'threat and extortion.'

House Republican leaders have faced internal pressure from a cadre of new members swept into power in a 2010 tea party landslide. Those conservatives are unlikely to be satisfied by any budget resolution that leaves Obamacare as-is.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid blamed House Republicans Monday for the brinksmanship that has pushed the u.S. toward a federal government shutdown

Their infighting, driven by a belief in small government and a desire to re-litigate the Obamacare debate, has provided an unwelcome dimension to the budget problem for Republicans, and a source of glee for Democrats.

A prominent Democratic political operative told MailOnline on Monday that 'the tea party nuts are spinning everyone's wheels, including Boehner's,' referring to Republican House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio.

'As long as there's no left-wing bloc in the Senate that's as easily identifiable as the tea party is on the right, the Republicans will always look like they can't keep their own house in order and our side will look pretty unified and reasonable.'

While the Senate convenes at 2:00, those Republicans will meet to play out scenarios, a GOP congressional staffer told MailOnline.

'Our members are going to be working this out,' the aide said. 'We're not going to be the ones kneeling on the football when the clock hits zero. If that means the federal government shuts down, we'll make sure the Senate has the ball at midnight.'

But Obama told reporters after a bilateral meeting with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he is 'not at all resigned' to the idea that the government will shut down.

'I suspect I'll be speaking to leaders today, tomorrow and the next day,' Obama said. Carney later told reporters that he had no information about any new meetings added to Obama's schedule.

Republicans blamed Senate Democrats on Saturday for not being at work as the House budget proposal sat without action

The president added that his only 
negotiation plan related to turning a short-term budget victory into a 
longer-term funding plan.

'The
Senate has passed a bill that keeps the government open, does not have a
lot of extraneous issues to it, allows us to then negotiate' future 
budgets, Obama said.

He holds out hope, Carney added an hour later, that Republicans will 'do the right thing' and acquiesce to the White House's demands.

The GOP should take 'the opportunity to follow the Senate's lead ... we would support that,' Carney insisted.

Washington Post associate editor Bob Woodward warned that President Obama would be blamed in the long term even though Republicans might catch more of the immediate blame

He refused, however, to predict whether the White House might embrace what one reporter called 'toll-both government,' – a one-week stopgap budget commitment that would give the political left and right some breathing room.

That idea would move the country closer to a second deadline, the federal government's looming reach of its constitutional debt ceiling. Another negotiation delay could up the ante at a time of more critical economic decisions.

'We certainly can't have any meaningful negotiations under the threat of default,' Obama said.

Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward suggested Monday morning that while Republicans may pay an immediate political price for a government shutdown, Obama himself would pay a greater price in history.

'He should be talking – they should be meeting – and they should be discussing this,' he said on MSNBC.

'The America economy is at stake and the president, if there is a downturn or a collapse or whatever could happen here that's bad, it's going to be on his head.'

A CNN/ORC poll released Monday morning shows that 46 per cent of Americans would blame congressional Republicans for a government shutdown, and 36 percent would blame the president. Another 13 per cent said they would hold both responsible.

CNN did not say if its poll asked whether Senate Democrats should share the blame.
