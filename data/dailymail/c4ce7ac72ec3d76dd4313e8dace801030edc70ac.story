The Obama administration's Veterans Affairs Department scandal deepened on Wednesday, with a whistle-blower from a Texas VA hospital saying the health system is run like 'an organized crime syndicate' and a preliminary inspector general report declaring that veterans in Phoenix waited an average of 115 days to be seen by a doctor.

The VA was rocked last month with allegations that 40 veterans died waiting for medical treatment at a health center in Phoenix, Arizona because staffers manipulated the appointment system to delay care.

The Daily Beast reported Wednesday that those delays appear systematic and ordinary – and endorsed by some in positions of power in the Texas VA health system.

Waiting and waiting and waiting: Wounded and sick veterans are waiting an average of 115 days for care in the Phoenix VA, while a manipulated appointment system made it look like a 24-day wait was typical

Disabled veterans make up a large contingent of those waiting for care at VA hospitals in at least 26 states

At the Central Texas Veterans Health Care System's Olin E Teague Veterans' Center, doctors debated now to back-date veterans' 'requested' appointment dates to make it look like published goals were being met

Obama has been an occasional visitor at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. During this visit, he prayed with a veteran and his family members

And the new
 interim inspector general report found that at least 1,700 veterans 
were denied spots on official waiting lists in Phoenix alone. And 84 per
 cent of them waited longer than the 14-day limit that's etched into 
published VA guidelines.

Under Phoenix's phony reporting system, the 115-day delays appeared to be only 24 days long.

In Phoenix, administrators changed computer records so it would appear that doctors were seeing veterans soon enough to satisfy existing standards. Meanwhile, they actually worked from a secret, off-the-books list.

In Texas, the manipulation took the form of back-dating appointments and taking advantage of technicalities in published guidelines in order to avoid an overflow of patients.

VA guidelines dictate that veterans should be seen by a medical professional within 14 days of the 'desired date' they request. Texas officials are accused of changing those desired dates in order to give schedulers more breathing room – and better employee performance reviews.

The Daily Beast suggested that the wrongdoing has been going on, unpunished, for years, raising doubts about whether any internal review of the agency would likely change the status quo.

'For lack of a better term, you’ve got an organized crime syndicate,' a Texas VA whistle-blower told the website's reporter. 'People up on top are suddenly afraid they may actually be prosecuted and they’re pressuring the little guys down below to cover it all up.”

'I see it in the executives' eyes,' the whistle-blower added. 'They are worried.'

Those performance reviews are key, since reporting subpar statistics means administrators 'won't stay a director very long and they certainly won’t get promoted,' the whistle-blower said. 'No one is getting rewarded for honesty. They pretty much have to lie, if they don’t they won’t go anywhere.'

Some in VA leadership appear to be conscientious enough to demand high standards.

In one email chain published by The Daily Beast, a scheduling coordinator named James Anderson told VA doctors statewide to change the 'desired date' for some veterans' care.

The Central Texas VA Chief of Staff, William Harper, would hear none of it.

'You cannot do this!!!! This is essentially fraud,' he replied. 'The desired date is what it is and if we don’t meet the standard then we will work to improve.'

Silence: President Barack Obama didn't mention the Veterans Affairs Department scandal at all on Wednesday as he delivered the commencement address at the United States Military Academy at West Point

Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America CEO Paul Rieckhoff said the news could get far worse.

'This newest case just further illustrates that the scandal is much more far reaching than most people realize,' he said. 'Phoenix was just the tip of the iceberg. Scandal has become the new normal.'

Congressional Republicans have responded to the crisis by demanding that VA Secretary Eric Shinseki allow veterans to seek private medical care – with full reimbursement – if they wait more 30 days or more for treatment.

House Veterans Affairs Committee chair Rep. Jeff Miller, a Florida Republican, said Tuesday that he would soon introduce a bill to cement that demand into policy.

'We simply can't afford to wait for the results of another investigation into a problem we already know exists,' Miller said in a statement.

'That's why I'm calling on Secretary Shinseki to take emergency steps.'

A VA spokesman responded in a statement that it was already redoubling its efforts nationwide.

'Each of our facilities is either enhancing their clinic capacity to help veterans get care sooner, or where we cannot increase capacity, increasing the care we acquire in the community through non-VA care,' statement read.

'Each of our facilities is reaching out to Veterans to coordinate the acceleration of their care.'

One legislative proposal has already stalled in the Democrat-controlled U.S. Senate. The Department of Veterans Affairs Management Accountability Act passed in the House by a 390-33 margin 
but a Senate committee chaired by the socialist Vermont 
Sen. Bernie Sanders has delayed considering it until June.

The bill would give Shineski and future VA secretaries broad authority to remove administrators who are complicit in delaying or denying care to veterans.

Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn called for an FBI investigation on Wednesday.

One good apple in a rotten barrel: Dr. William Harper (R) warned Texas VA doctors that back-dating 'requested' appointment dates was 'FRAUD'

'Hundreds
 of our nation’s heroes have disappeared from the appointment books and 
been denied medical care at the hands of scheming bureaucrats focused on
 their own financial gain,' he said, 'instead of the health and 
well-being of America’s veterans.'

'This
 is a sad day for our nation and the only fitting response in the 
short-term is for the president to direct the FBI to investigate these 
reports immediately.'

The
 VA's health care division could have trouble explaining its failures 
since records show it is flush with cash it hasn't been spending.

The Daily Caller reported Tuesday that the VA will 'carry over' about $450 million in medical care funding from fiscal year 2014 to fiscal year 2015.

Shinseki was given $54.6 billion to work with overall this year – an annual allocation $10 billion higher than in the first full-year Obama budget.

That year the agency shifted $1.449 billion in medical-care funding, money that it couldn't spend, into the following year's budget.

Even if veterans' care improves dramatically, the GOP is already making hay out of the scandal.

On Wednesday the Republican National Committee launched a telephone 'robocall' and Twitter campaign declaring that President Barack Obama is responsible for the VA mess, and urging heavy turnout among Republican voters in November.

The GOP is specifically tying the scandal to 10 vulnerable Democratic members of Congress, hoping to flip their seats to the Republican column.

For VA administrators, avoiding patient backlogs and racking up a good rate of on-time medical care – whether records are accurate or not – can contribute by as much as 50 per cent to the performance-ratings scores that determine annual bonuses and career advancement.
