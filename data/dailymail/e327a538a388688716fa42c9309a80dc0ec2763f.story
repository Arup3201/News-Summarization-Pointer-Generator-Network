Festive spending is expected to hit £45,000 a second tomorrow in what is set to be the busiest shopping day in British history.

Analysts are predicting consumers will spend a record £3.9 billion over 24 hours in a last-minute surge of present-buying.

Spending will average £2.7 million a minute, with the peak coming between 1pm and 2pm, during office workers’ lunch breaks.

Oxford Street was packed on Saturday but is expected to get even busier on Monday as shoppers rush out to buy last-minute gifts before the big day

Across the country retailers have slashed prices in store to encourage people in but full sales will not begin until Christmas eve

Visa, Europe’s biggest payment firm, predicts it will process 31 million UK card transactions, and Barclaycard expects customers to withdraw £25,000 a second from cash machines.

Here are the best of the online and shop sales – and the times that some of the best bargains will be going live.

And don’t forget, online sales continue after the shops close on Christmas Eve...

The frenzy will continue on Christmas Eve and even throughout Christmas Day, when a record number of shops are either opening or launching online sales.

It comes as retailers are slashing prices by more than 70 per cent and supermarkets open round the clock in a bid to boost their customer share.

Mandy Ryan, an analyst for the  British Retail Consortium, said: ‘Consumer confidence is considerably higher than it was last year but times remain challenging.

‘People don’t feel like they have more money than ever but they are taking advantage of some great  discounts.

‘Inflation is much less than last year so shoppers can get that little bit extra for their money.

'The fact that Christmas falls on a Wednesday means that a lot of people have Monday and  Tuesday off so can get more shopping done.

‘Footfall is actually down but that is because more people than ever are choosing to do their shopping online.’

Jeremy Nicholds, director of commercial development at Visa Europe, said: ‘The rush to shop online at the beginning of the month will be mirrored on our high streets on December 23, which we predict will be the busiest day of the year.

‘With £862,500 expected to be spent every minute on the UK’s high streets with Visa cards, there are indications that this may  well be the best Christmas for retailers.’

As well as making the most of pre and post-Christmas sales, more retailers are offering cut-price goods online on Christmas Day.

E-retail analyst IMRG predicts Christmas Day online sales will top £350 million and Boxing Day sales top £540 million.

A record 16,000 local convenience stores – or 32 per cent of the total – are expected to open on Christmas Day, according to the Convenience Store Association. They include large chains such as Budgens and Spar.

Diane Wehrle, marketing director for Springboard retail analysts, expects many more local shops to open on Christmas Day in the future, and predicts that in ten years Britain will have the lifted the ban on Christmas Day trading.

Currently shops bigger than 3,000 sq ft are not allowed  to open.

She said: ‘We are a multi-cultural society and while it’s Christmas for many people, for others it’s not a day of any particular significance.

‘Some people need to work and get along with their normal lives and that means being able to buy a few household items.

‘It’s handy for everyone. We have a 24-hour economy and you can’t close it down for one or two days, things have to carry on.’

The Citizens Advice Bureau warned against shoppers borrowing beyond their means by taking out payday and other  high-interest loans.

A spokesman said: ‘Christmas is a time of giving, but you don’t want to give yourself a headache in the New Year with bills and debts you can’t afford.

‘It’s all too easy to overspend – there are tempting offers and pressures to buy – but you must decide how much you can afford before you start spending.’

The police are planning a  Boxing Day blitz to thwart gangs and pickpockets aiming to target the traditional post-Christmas sales.

The offensive, known as Operation Nutcracker, will see teams of undercover police mingling with crowds on the streets, buses and trains.

About 100 uniformed beat officers, mounted officers and a police helicopter are also involved.

Four million Britons will be spending the holiday in sun spots abroad or on the ski slopes, and  a further eight million will be  taking breaks in this country.

Customer's spent £30,000 per second on Saturday, but that is expected to rise to £45,000 on Monday making it the busiest day in British retail history

Furby Boom! V Teksta robot:

Interactive: Furbys have made a comeback thanks to the Boom! version but are being rivaled by Teksta puppy

Two ‘pets’ you can control with  an app are the big-sellers.

The Furby Boom! (£54.99) is so sought-after that Toys R Us limited sales to two per customer, while the Teksta Robotic Puppy (£59.99) will do back-flips and chase a  ball and  a bone.

PS4 V iPad Mini 2:

Sony's Playstation 4 sold a million consoles on the first day and has been in high demand ever since

The iPad Mini 2 has experienced some supply issues with bosses warning not everyone will be able to find one

Since it went on sale in November, supplies of the iPad Mini 2 (from £219)  have been limited.

Even Apple’s chief executive Tim Cook has admitted  that ‘it’s not clear that everyone who wants one will be able to find one’ this Christmas.

The PlayStation 4 (from £349) has been flying off the shelves since selling a million consoles on its first day.

Alex Ferguson V Bridget Jones:

Page turner: Alex Ferguson's autobiography will make the perfect gift for any Red Devils fan while Helen Fielding's latest Bridget Jones offering has also been selling well

The former Manchester United manager stormed the non-fiction charts with My Autobiography (£12), his account of life at the Red Devils, while the eagerly awaited next instalment of Bridget Jones’s Diary has taken top spot  in the fiction category.

First week sales of  Bridget Jones: Mad About The Boy (£9) were up 250 per cent on other books in  the series, and Ferguson’s sporting memoir is the  year’s overall bestseller.

Chanel No 5 V One Direction:

Scent of success: Marilyn's favourite Chanel No 5 is going head-to-head with One Direction's Our Moment

The battle to be this year’s top fragrance is between X Factor runners-up One  Direction with Our Moment (£21), and Marilyn Monroe’s favourite, the classic Chanel No  5 (from £47.50).

Our Moment has already taken the title for bestselling celebrity fragrance while Chanel No  5 was happy  to bounce back from last year’s disastrous and baffling Brad Pitt advertising campaign.

The Bearded Head V Blow Monkey:

Off-the-wall: For shoppers looking for an odd but charming present the Beard Head will make the perfect gift for a man challenged in the facial hair department, while the Blow Monkey is perfect for girls who love a night out

For those moments when you  need to look like a lumberjack but don’t have the opportunity to grow a beard, you really need  look no further than the  Beard Head (from 19.99). 

And for women with no time on  their hands, the Blow Monkey (£7.95) nail-dryer is a must.

Archbishop Justin Welby has been silent on the issue of shops opening on Christmas Day along with many other senior church figures

The Church of England’s most senior 
leaders have failed to criticise the growing commercialisation of 
Christmas Day – despite predictions that people will spend a record 
£350 million online on the day itself and more shops than ever will 
open.

The Archbishops of
 Canterbury and York and the Bishop of London all declined to respond to
 questions last week about whether commercial pressures were eroding the
 spiritual values of one of the most important days in the Christian 
calendar.

Only a 
handful of bishops replied to a Mail on Sunday survey. The reluctance to
 speak out follows predictions by the retail organisation IMRG of a 15 
per cent jump this year in the amount spent in the online sales on 
Christmas Day, up from an estimated £307 million last year.

On top of this, a record 16,000 independently owned shops will open.

Judging
 by the 107 million visits made to online retail sites last year, the 
numbers of people shopping on Wednesday will dwarf even more the numbers
 attending a Church of England service, which in 2011 was just over 2.6 
million.

The Mail on 
Sunday contacted almost all of the Church’s 42 senior bishops over 
recent days, but spokesmen for the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin 
Welby, the Archbishop of York John Sentamu and the 
Bishop of London Richard Chartres said they did not wish to comment.

Among
 those who did respond, the Bishop of Norwich Graham James said: ‘It’s a
 pity if this one opportunity to rest from retail is eroded. It won’t do
 our spiritual health any good at all.’

The
 Bishop of Chester Peter Forster said the traditional association of 
Christmas with peace ‘should encourage everyone to avoid the commercial 
activity – just as, traditionally, armies did not continue fighting on 
Christmas Day’.

The 
Bishop of Wakefield Stephen Platten added: ‘Let us do our best to retain
 at least one day in the year when as many people as possible can be 
given a proper break and hopefully also reflect upon the deepest aspects
 of our existence.’

The 
Bishop of Bradford Nick Baines said: ‘The Beatles got it right: ‘Can’t 
buy me love’. The loss of shopping-free days – a sabbath – is serious 
for the good of individuals, families and communities.’

And the Bishop  of St Albans Alan Smith said: ‘The true message of Christmas is about giving.’
