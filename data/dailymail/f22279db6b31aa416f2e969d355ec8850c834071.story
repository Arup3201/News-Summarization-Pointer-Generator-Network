There are many ways to use up dreary old attic space but this homeowner came up with an idea out of this world - and transformed it into their very own space shuttle.

On the market for £3,250,000, this eight-bedroom Victorian property appears to be like any other traditional stately home.

Much of the mansion located in Crystal Palace, South London, is decorated in a traditional Gothic style complete with chandeliers and dark wood paneling.

But potential buyers are in for a surprise as the current owner has decked out the attic to resemble the inside of a space shuttle to entertain his three sons.

But the loft is not the only futuristic aspect of the specious former dental practice which is spread across 6,988 square feet .

Several potential buyers have viewed the property but it is currently still on the market

Megan Longworth, a sales negotiator at Hamptons Dulwich branch, told the Evening Standard: 'There’s a spaceship in the loft with computers built in, they don’t work any more but they did once.'
