Neymar scored two goals to take his international record to an astonishing 42 in 59 appearances as Brazil beat Turkey 4-0 in a friendly on Wednesday.

Turkey defender Semih Kaya scored an own goal in the 25th and Chelsea midfielder Willian found the net in the 44th after a pass by Neymar - whose name was chanted by the home crowd.

'I was really moved by that,' Neymar said. 'It's another stadium, another country that will be in my heart for ever. I can't explain. I never imagined something like this.'

Brazil have won every game since Dunga took over after their disappointing home World Cup, previously beating Colombia, Ecuador, Argentina and Japan and have now outscored their opponents 12-0.

'The team played well from the beginning, defending well, controlling ball possession and capitalizing on the scoring chances that we created,' Chelsea midfielder Willian said.

They will play their final match of the year on Tuesday against Austria in Vienna.

'We need to keep improving day after day,' Paris Saint-Germain defender David Luiz said. 'We need to have our feet on the ground and try to improve in all areas all the time.'

Turkey have made a slow start in qualifying for the European Championship and are last in their group with only one point from three matches.

Neymar opened the scoring after a perfect 40-yard pass by midfielder Fernandinho. The Barcelona striker controlled the ball with his chest before breaking into the penalty area unmarked and tapping the ball into the corner. 

His second goal followed a one-two with Willian that allowed him to make a run inside the area for another easy finish.

It leaves Neymar six goals short of the 48 scored by Zico, Brazil's fourth-leading scorer of all time.

'I think I'm going through the best moment of my career,' Neymar said. 'But I don't want to stop here. I want to keep getting better and better.' 

Turkey's Kaya turned the ball into his own net while trying to block a cross from the right flank by  Porto full back Danilo.

Willian added Brazil's third with a low shot after Neymar set him up following a run through the left side of the area.

Dunga was without players from Brazilian clubs as the local season is reaching its decisive rounds. He left out players such as Kaka and Robinho, who had been called up for friendlies last month.
