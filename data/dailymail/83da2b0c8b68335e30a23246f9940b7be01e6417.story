An Arizona jail officer has been gunned down in front of his own home on his way to work, leading to a furious search for the man who killed him Thursday.

Hours after the murder of Jorge Vargas, a 27-year-old married father of a little boy, his boss, Maricopa County Sheriff's Joe Arpaio announced that he is issuing every deputy in his department an AR-15 assault rifle and commanding them to carry loaded guns at all times - even when off duty.

Phoenix police Sgt. Trent Crump said Vargas succumbed to his injuries Thursday about an hour after the 4am shooting.

Vargas, an eight-year veteran of the jail, was apparently getting ready to go to work and working on his truck when someone shot him in his driveway.

Officers searched on foot and by helicopter for the shooter, who is believed to have been seen fleeing the neighborhood on foot.

By Thursday night, the shooter still remained at large.

Arizona authorities have no suspects or a motive but are investigating whether the shooting was connected to Vargas' job as a jail detention officer.

At a news conference on Thursday evening, Arpaio - a controversial figure in Phoenix - conceded that it was possible that Vargas was targeted because of his work.

Perhaps to underscore the point - though not directly related to Vargas' murder - Arpaio announced he would handing out 400 Smith & Wesson AR-15 semi-aromatic rifles to his deputies.

He said the rifles will ensure his officers are safe when faced with increasingly more powerful weapons in the hands of criminals. He says he purchased the weapons with money seized during arrests.

The sheriff also announced Thursday that each of his patrol deputies must carry a firearm with them at all times to be able to combat crime even when they aren't on duty.

Arpaio says 'we live in a violent society,' and he wants his officers to have 'enough firepower to fight back.'

The new weapons and the new rules would not apply to jail officers like Vargas.

In the shooting of Vargas, multiple gunshots rang out outside the Phoenix home of the Maricopa County detention officer at around 4am.

Neighbors rushed to the scene, only to find the officer lying next to his pickup truck near 912st Avenue and Durango Street. No one else was home at the time of the shooting, the station KPHO reported.

Authorities are looking into the possibility that Vargas' murder was related to his job in the detention center

According to eyewitnesses, a Hispanic man in his 20s wearing a white T-shirt and black shorts was seen fleeing from the crime scene.

The mortally wounded jail employee was rushed to St Joseph’s Hospital, where he was pronounced dead a short time later.

According to investigators, the officer was partially dressed in his uniform and was apparently getting ready to go to work at the time of the shooting. 

Officers who responded to the scene blocked off the area around the victim’s house and launched a search for the gunman. They stopped several vehicles and questioned a number of people, but no arrests have been made.
