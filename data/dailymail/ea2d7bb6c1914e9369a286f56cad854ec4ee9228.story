Violent end: Businessman John Steele took his own life on July 11 after battling with depression

A prominent Dallas businessman who horrifically committed suicide last month in his home had a powerful medication for insomnia in his system, an autopsy report revealed. 

John Rodman Steele stood over his sleeping wife on July 11th with a knife and tried attacking her, investigation papers said. He then fatally stabbed himself.

The autopsy report, released by the Dallas County Medical Examiner’s Office, revealed that the BMW car dealership owner had .05 milligrams of zolpidem, a powerful insomnia medication, in his system.

In the aftermath of Steele’s death, friends of the family told NBC Dallas-Fort Worth that the 50-year-old father of two suffered from sleeplessness.

In an unusual move, the Medical Examiner’s office also released detailed summary of the investigation, including interviews with his wife Dina, and his psychiatrist. 

In the summaries, it was revealed that the family was struggling with their finances and also had legal troubles.

The reports read that on the night of July 11th, Steele entered the couple’s bedroom and began attacking his wife Dina with a kitchen knife, who was sleeping at the time. 

According to the report, Steele attacked his wife with the knife, injuring her.

At that point, their 16-year-old son 
heard his mother’s screams and came into the room, trying to wrestle the
knife from his father.

The son rushed to call 911, at which point Steele apparently stabbed himself to the chest, some reports say in front of his teenaged son.

He was taken to the emergency room, where he was pronounced dead.

The report revealed that Steele had a long history of prescription painkiller abuse, which he hid from his wife and children. His psychiatrist said that he had been using Vicodin, a powerful drug used to moderate severe pain, for up to 2-3 years.

During that time, the doctor said, he had also battled severe depression and anxiety, but refused to be admitted into an impatient facility, as his wife would then know he was having difficulties with depression.

Mrs Steele was taken to the hospital and was treated for the injuries sustained. She was later released, WFAA reported.

Insomniac: An autopsy report found that he had Zolpiderm in his system, a generic sleep aid that slows brain function to allow for sleep

Mrs Steele did not immediately respond to MailOnline’s request for comment. 

NBC DFW reported that there is a note in front of the Steele’s Highland Park home that is asking for privacy.

Zolpidem, a prescription sleep aid, is used to treat insomnia and works by slowing brain activity to allow for sleep, according to the National Institute of Health.

Brand-name forms of zolpidem include Ambien, Edluar, Internezzo, and Zolpmist.

The NIH urges those with depression, mental illness, thoughts of harming yourself or others, and those with suicidal thoughts to tell their doctors.

The government agency also advises that those taking the drug may experience ‘unexpected’ changes in behaviour and mental health.

Man of God: Steele taught Sunday school at the Highland Park United Methodist Church, where he also led Bible studies

Success: Among other ventures, he owned the BMW dealership in Permian Basin

They write: ‘It is hard to tell if these changes are caused by zolpidem or if they are caused by physical or mental illnesses that you may already have or suddenly develop.’

It warns that some may develop aggressiveness, strange behaviours, hallucinations, out-of-body experiences, and anxiety.

Steele’s obituary said that he ‘deeply loved his wife and children…and beloved friend.’ He was also a member of Highland Park United Methodist Church, and practiced his faith in part by teaching Sunday school classes and leading Bible studies.

He also served on the church’s advisory board, as well as the advisory boards of two banks.

He had no previous history of violent behaviour.For confidential support call the Samaritans in the UK at 08457 90 90 90 or visit a local Samaritans branch, see www.samaritans.org for details. In the U.S. call the National Suicide Prevention Line at 1-800-273-8255
