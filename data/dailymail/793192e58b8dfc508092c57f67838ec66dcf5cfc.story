Boston Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling was not one of the four players to be voted into baseball's Hall of Fame this year, and the World Series champ is speaking out as to why he believes he did not make the cut.

Schilling, who over his 20 year career notched 216 wins - three of which came during World Series play - is claiming that his politics are keeping him from being admitted into his sport's most hallowed hall.

'I know that as a Republican that there’s some people that really don’t like that,' said Schilling.

Legends: Pitchers Randy Johnson, Pedro Martinez (above) and John Smoltz did make the cut, alongside Houston Astros infielder Craig Biggio

The right-hander revealed this during an interview with WEEI after it was announced that three pitchers were among the four players who would be inducted into the Hall of Fame this year.

Randy Johnson, Pedro Martinez and John Smoltz were the hurlers to make the cut, alongside Houston Astros infielder Craig Biggio.

As for Schilling, he thinks that his support of President George Bush, who he actively campaigned for in 2004, has alienated many of the Hall of Fame voters.

'I don’t think that it kept me out or anything like that, but I do know there are guys who probably will never vote for me because of the things I said or did,' he said.

'That’s the way it works.' 

That being said, new inductee Smoltz, who Schilling claims is a Democrat, did donate to Mitt Romney's campaign during his 2012 run for the presidency. 

Waiting: Players who just missed the cut this year include Roger Clemens (above), Sammy Sosa, Mark McGwire and Barry Bond

The Baseball Writers' Association of America votes on who will be admitted to the Hall of Fame each year, with a player needing to appear on 75 percent of the ballots to make the cut.

A player becomes eligible for the honor five years after retiring, and can only appear on the ballot for 10 years.

This year was Schilling's third, and he appeared on 39.2 percent of the ballots.

Other players who just missed the cut include Roger Clemens, Sammy Sosa, Mark McGwire and Barry Bonds.

Schilling, who began his career with the Philadelphia Phillies, is best known for his performance in the 2004 American League Championship Series, when he led the Red Sox to a victory over the New York Yankees while pitching on an injured ankle in game six of the seven game series.

The Red Sox would go on to win the World Series that year, their first victory in 86 years. 

Schilling revealed in February 2014 that he was battling oral cancer, but he is currently in remission.
