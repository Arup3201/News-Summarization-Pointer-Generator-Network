Towson University’s champion cheerleaders have been suspended for hazing.

The Baltimore school’s cheerleading squad has been suspended for a recent hazing incident that the school has not yet disclosed. An investigation into the matter has been completed, but an appeal is still on-going, Gay Pinder, media relations, told MailOnline. The university first learned of the allegations Aug. 6.

A total of 10 incoming freshman co-eds were hazed, Ms Pinder told MailOnline, adding that they went unharmed.

The team has been suspended for the entire 2013-2014 academic year, according to Ms. Pinder.

First enacted while the university looked into the allegations, the punishment stood after the investigation was completed. The suspension was first reported by the university’s student newspaper The Torchlight.

‘Towson has a policy of no hazing and we do take that very seriously, said Ms. Pinder, ‘we have high expectations of our students and expect them to treat each other with the utmost respect.’

The school has not yet released the details surrounding exactly how the students were hazed, and Ms Pinder declined to provide those details to MailOnline.

It is not clear if this is the first incident of hazing involving the cheer team, according to Ms Pinder.While sports teams have usually been in the hazing spotlight, pep squads have been outed as hazers as well.

A drum major at Florida A&M University died after a 2011 hazing incident during which he was beaten by several members of the school band.

‘I have never heard of a whole team getting suspended,’ Jim Lord, executive director of the American Association of Cheerleading Coaches and Administrators told the Baltimore Sun. ‘That is pretty rare, maybe unheard of,’ he added.

In April, Towson’s cheerleaders placed first in the All-Girl Division I section of the National Cheerleaders Association's Collegiate Cheerleading Championship. Their win proffered them an automatic spot in the 2014 competition, one they look unlikely to attend.
