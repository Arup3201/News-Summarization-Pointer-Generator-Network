Struggle to find the right shade of lipstick? Never feel you can find foundation to match your skin? Well, it may surprise you to know that, for years, wealthy women have rejected one-colour-suits-all cosmetics in favour of having beauty products made specifically to suit them.

And now — thanks to a raft of new High Street services — the rest of us can get in on the act, too. Alice Smellie rounds up the best bespoke beauty products at bargain basement prices.

LIPSTICK

Cosmetics a la Carte offer a bespoke lipstick service at the Motcomb Street shop

Bespoke lipstick service, £50 per lipstick, at Cosmetics a la Carte, alacartelondon.com

Make an appointment at the pretty Motcomb Street shop, in London’s South Kensington, and you will be talked through the bespoke make-up of your choice: eyeshadow, foundation or lipstick.

Foundations are blended to your skin tone and eyeshadows and lipsticks can be any shade you like. Compare this £50 price tag per product with the bespoke lipstick I have heard about, which would set you back more than £40,000 (the case is made of gold and is covered in jewels).

I sit down with manager Laura Martin — these all take place in person — and she asks what I’m looking for. I know exactly what I want. Back in the Eighties, Rimmel made a lipstick called Black Cherry — a rich reddish purple which I wore throughout my teens.

I’ve never found anything which suits me quite so well. The shop is literally packed with hundreds of lipsticks, so I select one that is similar, but too dark and not as sheer as my teen favourite.

So Laura scrapes a little off this, then some from a rich lip balm with gold flecks and mixes them together with a brush on a small palate. It looks gorgeous when I try it on and I am transported back to my teens.

‘Wait a moment,’ says Laura. ‘Why don’t we add just a touch of rose pink?’

She mixes in a bit of a pinker lipstick and I apply it again. Without wanting to sound evangelical (or vain), it looks staggering. OK, £50 is a lot for a lipstick, but I waste so much money on shades which don’t suit me that I think it money well spent.

VERDICT: I am presented with two stunning lipsticks — one the grown up version of Black Cherry and another a slightly (and admittedly more flattering) pinker shade. Nancy (after my grandmother) and Lara (after my daughter) are just perfect.

PERFUME

The Perfume Studio hold events nationwide where you learn about perfume and create your own blend (picture posed by model)

Perfume Studio, from £39, theperfumestudio.com

Master perfumer Francois Robert is the inspiration behind the business. This cheerful but austere Frenchman is a fourth generation perfumer whose father worked at Chanel in the Fifties.

They hold events nationwide for 20-odd participants, where you learn about perfume and then create your own blend. I am astonished by the low prices. A high-end, bespoke perfume could easily cost £25,000.

I meet with consultant manager Helen Janousek in Central London. Consultations and events are all in person, though once they have details of your perfume on the database, you can simply order more.

She shows me an array of glass bottles, containing 18 blends of perfume oils, arranged in three sets of six and explains the three key notes of a perfume: the base, middle and the top. The plan is that you select three from these blends — one from each section — to create your own.

I am invited to dip a scent strip (basically a strip of paper) into each one and smell it. I’m surprised at how easily I discard most of them — anything spicy is instantly put to one side.

I especially like Green, which is reminiscent of damp grass on a warm June evening, and I also love a floral blend similar to Amarige by Givenchy, which I wear most of the time. When I have isolated my three favourite smells, they are poured into a bottle, and blended to create my own fragrance.

Tempting as it is to call my perfume Smellie (the one time my surname comes in handy) I hold off, and call it Alice instead.

VERDICT: The result is all of my favourite scents in one little bottle. It has the sweetness of Amarige, but with a hint of fresh grass. I am over the moon and waft happily through the next few days. A session would make an amazing present.

FACE CREAM

Jennifer Young bespoke products start at £12 (picture posed by model)

‘I wanted to be able to offer bespoke products to everyone,’ says Jennifer Young when I ask her about her extraordinarily low prices. Consultations are either in person, on the phone or online and products start at £12.

Bespoke face creams tend to cost at least as much as a week’s groceries. There is a beautiful, but pricey offering for £195 from The Organic Pharmacy and, this week, a new one was reported as being exclusively available at the Dorchester Hotel for an extraordinary £950, made with your own blood (yuck).

So I am enchanted with the idea of having a face cream with my name on it, especially as people (my husband) are always stealing things from my bathroom shelf. Jennifer and one of her consultants come to meet me to talk through the process and she tries a few different oils on the back of my hand.

‘The ones which suit your skin sink in,’ she explains — macadamia nut oil leaves no residue but rosehip sits on the top.

Next, she asks me to identify three key issues which I’d like to tackle in order to select the most beneficial essential oils.

I think hard and decide on sleeplessness, mature skin and anger (come on, it’s winter). She suggests a soothing combination of lavender, bergamot and sandalwood. Two days later, my very own face cream arrives in the post.

VERDICT: The originally named Alice’s Moisturiser is richly scented and cotton soft. I pat it onto my face after a bath and my skin feels deliciously smooth. Worth mentioning: having your name on a product doesn’t stop people nicking it.

FOUNDATION

Protect and Perfect Foundation in Warm Beige, £16.59, boots.com

No 7 Match Made service, free in more than 900 stores nationwide, (Protect and Perfect Foundation in Warm Beige, £16.59, boots.com)

Boots’ own brand No 7 has developed a gadget which takes a close-up shot of your skin then exactly matches it to one of their foundations. The accepted method of testing foundation along my jawline and then looking at it in daylight is so last decade.

This is a mobile-phone-like device containing a camera, which, when held against your face, takes 27 individual pictures of the skin using LED lights, covering the whole colour spectrum.

These pictures are analysed by the machine and every single element of your skin tone (looking at yellows and blues as well as light and dark) is matched to the ideal foundation shade.

After a couple of minutes, the screen flashes up with the information that my ideal skin product is Warm Beige in Protect and Perfect Foundation.

Clearly, the service is only applicable to No 7 products, although it can recommend products if you want to go lighter or darker than your natural skin tone (which is fairly likely in early February).

VERDICT: It’s a perfectly pleasant foundation, evening out my skin and giving it a dewy finish. However, it’s a bit paler than I’d like ideally. A good service, but it feels a bit of a gimmick

FACE OIL

Facial oil, £40, skinbistro.co.uk

Award-winning scientist and skincare specialist Andrea Palluch makes bespoke products for anyone wanting a touch of luxury, as well as those who struggle to find the right products for specific skin needs.

Her blends are made with completely natural and Fairtrade ingredients. Facial oils are gloriously moisturising. As it happens, I have just finished the final drops of one, which I can’t justify replacing in these belt-tightened post-tax-bill times.

When I shop around, I find that a personally blended oil can cost £250 if you go to a luxury brand such as de Mamiel. Not a chance!

I fill in the online consultation form, which is detailed — asking both skin condition and tone, skincare routine, diet and any medical conditions or allergies.

Andrea writes back to me (you can also have a phone call) recommending that she use rosehip oil which is good for fine lines, camellia for intense moisturising, hemp, kiwi and avocado.

VERDICT: Ironically, the bottle is similar to that produced by the expensive cousin and the oil is both blissfully moisturising on my skin and smells as though it cost at least twice the price.
