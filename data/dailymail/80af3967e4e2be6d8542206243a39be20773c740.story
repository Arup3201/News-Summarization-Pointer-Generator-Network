A sex themed park is in the works in Taiwan.

Tourism officials' surefire plan to draw in more visitors will be built on a 37-mile stretch of land along the coast.

The park, to be called Romantic Boulevard, will feature heart-shaped arches, a glass church and outdoor garden filled with erotic sculptures of people and animals in 'various lovemaking positions.'

A sex themed park is in the works in Taiwan, said to be modelled after South Korea's Jeju Loveland (pictured) 

Unlike Jeju Loveland, Romantic Boulevard also hopes to include a 'scenic area' for wedding photos

'We want people to fall in love with Taiwan, as well as fall in love while in Taiwan, Shih Chao-hui, the deputy director of Southwest Coast National Scenic Area Office, told the Wall Street Journal.

The proposed park will likely be modelled after the similarly sex themed Jeju Loveland in South Korea.

Jeju Loveland, which opened in 2014, likewise boasts racy statues.

Still in the early phases of development, Romantic Boulevard also plans to include a 'scenic area' for couples to take wedding portraits.

According to Shih, over 200,000 people visited the site earlier this month.

But not everyone is thrilled with the new development - including some locals and the central government's Tourism Bureau, which is concerned that the park will hurt Taiwan's reputation abroad.

Such a proposed park is garnering mixed reviews from both locals and the government's Tourism Board

However, the developer believes that the public and tourist interest will outweigh any potential upset

Shih, however, says that the public interest outweighs the potential upset.

'Look, we are in the business of tourism, not education or religion, so the question should be, will the park generate business opportunities and we believe the answer is yes,' Shih told China Real Time.

Shih is currently seeking more investors and also hopes for a hotel to be built next to the park 'just in case visitors want to turn their feelings into actions.'
