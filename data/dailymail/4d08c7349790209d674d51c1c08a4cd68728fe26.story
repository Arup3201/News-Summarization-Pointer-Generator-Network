London topped the list, with an average of $5.21 a kilometre, just ahead of Sydney, at $5 flat.

Next most expensive was Tokyo, which was $3.0, Berlin at $2.92 and Paris at $2.90.

Taipei, Beijing and Seoul were all under $1 a km, while the cheapest on the list was Bangkok, at a mere 33 cents a km.

While the rate of the taxi is one factor, the relative distance of the airport to the CBD can be another decisive aspect.

Sydney fared much better in this field, with a mere 8km distance to the city centre.

Narita Airport in Japan was the furthest from the city centre, with a 71 km distance from the heart of Tokyo.

Last year, a study from exchange company Moneycorp found that the most expensive taxi-ride from an airport to the city was Tokyo, with an average $360 a journey.
