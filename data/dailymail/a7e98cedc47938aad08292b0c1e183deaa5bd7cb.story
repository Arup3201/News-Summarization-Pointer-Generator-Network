The daughter of a prominent New Hampshire businessman is accused of ransacking her father's grave in search of his 'real will,' only to find a pack of cigarettes clutched in his hand.

The entrepreneur, Edward 'Eddie' Nash, died of a heart attack in 2004 at age 68. His cement vault at the Colebrook Village Cemetery was found cracked last month, the casket opened and his remains rummaged through. The body was left intact.

An arrest affidavit names Nash's daughter, Melanie Lynch, of Merrimack, 52, who also goes by Melanie Nash, and two alleged accomplices, Ginette Dowse, of Clarkesville, 71, and Michael Day, of Columbia, 37.

Lynch had made comments about her father being buried with 'the real will,' a police affidavit said.

According to the arrest document, on the night of May 11, Dowse gave the other two a ride to the cemetery. She told police Lynch and Day dug up the grave and destroyed the concrete vault and metal casket.

Dowse said when she returned several hours later to pick them up, Lynch told her she found nothing and 'it was not as bad as she thought it was going to be,' stated the affidavit.

She told Dowse the next day that her father had a pack of cigarettes in his hand.

'You hear of grave robbing 100, 150 years ago,' Jenkins and Newman Funeral Home Director Michael Pearson told the station WMUR last month. 'You don't think of it in 2014.'

Day, who was arrested Tuesday, was jailed on charges of interference with a cemetery and criminal mischief. He is scheduled for a probable cause hearing June 19.
