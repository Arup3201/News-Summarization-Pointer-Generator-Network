Jay Strand, aged 10, died of a suspected asthma attack at his home in Snaith, East Yorkshire. His mother claims an ambulance took half an hour to reach him

A mother claims her son died as ambulance staff took half an hour to reach him, and just a month away from hospitals tests for what she believes was a 'serious undiagnosed condition.'

Ten-year-old Jay Strand died in his mother's arms from a suspected asthma attack.

Mother Donna Hellewell, from Snaith, North Yorkshire, who has chronic emphysema and has had one lung removed, desperately tried to resuscitate her son herself as he lay dying, but was physically unable.

He died on December 11.

She now believes he may have had a much more serious underlying illness.

She said: 'He came out of the bathroom and asked for his inhaler. Then he said "mum I'm dying" and he collapsed. He was here one minute and gone the next.

'I tried to resuscitate him but there was just nothing. I knew he was gone.'

Ms Hellewell - who said the family has a history of serious lung problems - claims Jay was just weeks away from a hospital appointment made so doctors could investigate whether he had a more serious condition.

She said she had begged with the hospital to bring the appointment forward over concerns for her son's deteriorating health, but to no avail.

Miss Hellewell believes her son might still be alive if the appointment had been moved forward and that Jay did not die from an asthma attack but an undiagnosed lung condition.

She said: 'I suffer from chronic emphysema and I had to have a lung removed 18 months ago.

'I kept going back to my nurse and telling her that Jay was really ill and needed the appointment brought forward but nobody would take me seriously.'

She said Jay cried out for help and struggled for breath while it took an ambulance 30 minutes to arrive.

She desperately began CPR after his mouth turned black.

Jay had been due to undergo tests at hospital next month to determine if he had a more serious condition, his mother says. She said her pleas to bring the appointment forward over fears for her son's health were ignored

Ms Hellewell put a breathing mask on her son but he pushed it back, saying: 'Mum, I'm dying.'

After ringing an ambulance twice, she said one turned up half an hour later but her son was already dead.

It is still not known whether Jay suffered from an underlying condition, but his mother has vowed to find out.

A Doncaster and Bassetlaw Hospitals NHS Foundation trust spokesman said it was unable to release details about Jay's condition.

A spokesman said: 'We offer our deepest sympathies and condolences to Jay's family and we are carrying out a full investigation into the care he received.

Jay's mother Donna Hellewell, who has chronic emphysema, believes her son may have had a more serious lung condition and has now vowed to get answers

'We will, of course be keeping Jay's family fully informed throughout and we would be happy to meet with them to hear their concerns and answer any questions they may have.'

A Yorkshire Ambulance trust spokesman said:Â  'Firstly and foremost we would like to express our deepest sympathy to the family at this difficult time.

'Representatives from the Trust have met with the family to discuss their concerns and answer any questions. The Trust is still looking into some aspects of the emergency response and has confirmed that it will continue to liaise with the family directly to share their findings relating to this incident.

'The Trust will see what lessons can be learned and what action can be taken in the future as part of our continued commitment to provide the highest quality clinical care to patients.'

Jay was a popular pupil at Snaith Primary School and hundreds attended his funeral. He left behind a father Leigh, 44, sister Lucy, 12, and brother Daniel, 26.

Chelsea fan Jay represented his local sea scouts as a poppy bearer at a Remembrance day service just a month before he died and was described by his mum as 'the most happy and loving child anyone could meet.'
