Move over Bono, Bon Jovi, Jay-Z, and several other celebrities that one might expect to be named the highest paid musician this year.

Rockstar-status hip-hop producer Dr. Dre landed the number one spot on Forbes‘ 2012 list of top earners in the music business.

The other four big earners were Roger Waters of Pink Floyd, Elton John, U2 and British boy band Take That. MailOnline’s personal favourite, Justin Beiber, 18, just made into the top ten, tying with Toby Keith.

Made man: Dre's big earnings in 2012 are largely due to the success of his self-titled headphone brand

Dre, 47, a former member of the controversial rap group NWA and Eminem’s primary mentor, came in first this year with earnings of $110 million (£68.7 million), largely due to the success of his luxury headphone line, ‘Beats By Dr. Dre.’

The Compton California native, born Andre Romelle Young, and Interscope Geffen A&M Records Chairman Jimmy Iovine started the company Beats Electronics in 2006 and debuted the highly profitable headphone line in 2008. The company is headquartered in Santa Monica, California.

Hi-fi wire company Monster was granted exclusive rights under a 5-year contract to manufacture and develop the Dre-branded headphones.

‘The brands are so aligned, Dre and Beats, it’s just who he is,’ Kevin Liles, former president of Def Jam Recordings, told Forbes.

Dre co-founded the record label Death Row Records in 1991 with Marion ‘Suge’ Knight Jr. and then left Death Row in 1996 to establish his own label, Aftermath Entertainment. He signed Eminem two years later.

Dre has released two solo albums throughout his music career and has produced beats for dozens of artists, including Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent, Toni Braxton, Kendrick Lamar and Rakim.

Dre was the only U.S. native among the top five earners in 2012.

The Irish rock group U2 led Forbes list of the richest in the music business in 2011 with $195 million (£121.8 million) and in 2010 with $130 million (£81.2).

Forbes’ estimates were based on total earnings from May 2011 to May 2012, including the amount of money each artist and band made from record sales, touring, endorsements, merchandise sales and other ventures before subtracting management fees, legal costs and taxes.
