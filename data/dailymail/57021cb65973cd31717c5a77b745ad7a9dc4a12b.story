New Lancashire coach Ashley Giles talks to Sportsmail about how he is king of breakfast and loves America. 

Who is your sporting hero?

My 12-year-old daughter, Tilly. She has a real spirit about the way she plays her hockey, netball and athletics. She said I was her sporting hero in a scholarship interview so I can repay the compliment!

The former cricketer said he loves the spectacle of Formula One and admires Lewis Hamilton in the sport

What would you be if you weren’t a sportsman?

I’d loved to have been a pilot because I have always been into planes and my dad was an apprentice when he was young. But I don’t think I would ever have got the qualifications.

Which other sportsman would you like to be?

Lewis Hamilton or Rory McIlroy. I love cars and the spectacle of Formula One, and I love playing golf. I have enormous respect for the quality and consistency of both these guys and McIlroy is going to become really special.

career HIGHLIGHT?

The Ashes 2005. We were up against the Australian galacticos at their best and when we started doing well the whole country was gripped by the cricket. I was the oldest member of the team and we hadn’t won the Ashes since I was a boy. It’s amazing to think it was 10 years ago now. There will always be a special bond between us all.

World Number One golfer Rory McIlroy is another sportsman Giles would have liked to have been 

Giles (left) said the best moment of his career was winning The Ashes against Australia in 2005 

... AND THE Worst moment?

Losing the Champions Trophy final in 2013. When Eoin Morgan and Ravi Bopara were together against India at Edgbaston I said, ‘We’re going to win this’, then it all went wrong. Who knows what might have been different now if we had won.

If your house was burning down, what one possession would you save?

Photos of our children and Charlie the cat.

Best advice you’ve ever been given?

Keep getting up, never give up.

Favourite karaoke song?

Fly me to the Moon. I sang it once in my early days as Warwickshire coach in front of all the lads. It wasn’t very good but I love that kind of music.

Three most-listened-to songs on your iPod?

Drops of Jupiter by Train, Mr Blue Sky by ELO and Elton John’s Your Song which was our wedding song.

The 41-year-old's karaoke song is Frank Sinatra's Fly Me To The Moon after singing it as Warwickshire coach

Giles called himself the 'king of breakfast' and would like to live and work in the United States of America 

Last film you saw?

Planet of the Apes with the kids. Good family entertainment. 

Last book you read?

The Score Takes Care Of Itself by Bill Walsh. He was the coach of the San Francisco 49ers and transformed them. Everyone was important to him, from the girl on reception to the quarterback.

Can you cook? Best dish? 

I’m the king of breakfast in our house.

In a film of your life, who would YOU like to play you?

George Clooney. When I batted with Kevin Pietersen at The Oval in 2005, he talked about my grey hairs. I told him it was the Clooney look and he’s called me George ever since.

What’s the most expensive thing you’ve ever bought?

Our house or on a smaller scale an LS Lowry Original Lithograph.

Tell us a secret...

We love the States. I’d love to live and work in America one day.
