A Manhattan apartment building has done away with front door keycards and replaced them with a facial recognition system that opens the security door after a resident glances into the camera.Knickerbocker Village is a housing development in the Lower East Side with 12 buildings and 1,600 apartments, making it difficult for the four guards on duty to monitor the comings and goings, even with the 128 surveillance cameras mounted around the buildings.So the complex's general manager, Vincent Callagy, decided to have the FST21 SafeRise system installed.

Opening doors: Residents at Knickerbocker Village need only their own faces to enter the building

Say cheese: The cameras are designed to be vandal-resistant

Now, residents simply stroll in, looking at the camera and the front door unlocks before they break their stride.

'Our old system used to have a card. If you lose your card, we have to charge you for a new card. If you forget your card, you can't get in the building. It's kind of hard to forget your face,' Callagy told Fox 5.

The FST21 SafeRise is the brainchild of former Israel Defense Forces Major General Aharon Farkash, who says the system works because it's so simple.

Little village: The vast 1930s-era apartment project is home to about 4,000 people

No more keys: The system takes a series of measurements and stores them in a database

Residents are all entered into the system by having a series of photographs of themselves taken, as well as other body measurements and movements.

After that, they simply walk through the front door.

'We donâ€™t do traditional face [scans],' Daniel Peled, vice president, sales and marketing told the New York Post.

'It is a fusion of identify technologies - one is facial recognition [but] there are behavior analytics and other items that are part of our patented technology.'

Visitors will speak to a 'Digital Doorman' which will refer them to the intercom system for permission to enter from the building's residents, or to the security desk.

The FST12 even has licence plate recognition that will identify non-resident cars, even if it's 'tailgating' a resident, and alert guards on duty.
