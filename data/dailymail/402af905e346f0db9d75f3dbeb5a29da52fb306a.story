Travellers: William and John Connors, pictured at an earlier court hearing, were today jailed for three years

Two travellers who housed vulnerable men 
in squalid conditions, beat them and made them work for up to 80 hours a
week were today jailed for three years.

John Connors, 31, and his 
brother-in-law William Connors, 35, lived in comfort while their 
‘employees’ slept in tents and received little or no pay.

They were beaten with shovels, had 
their hair shaved and were forced to go to the toilet in bushes, 
Southampton Crown Court heard.

The Connors lured unemployed men who 
were homeless or had drink problems into a life of misery with the 
promise of work laying block paving or tarmac, accommodation, food, 
drink and alcohol.

They had their driving licences, 
passports and money taken from them and feared they would be tracked 
down and beaten if they tried to escape.

On occasions they were even forced to fight each other to entertain the other travellers as they placed bets on the winner.

One worker - nicknamed ‘Horse’ because
of his strength and efforts - was branded with a tattoo of a 
‘travelling horse’ on his back.

The workers - whom had fallen on hard 
times after marriage breakdowns - were offered up to £30 a day but
most never received a penny.

Prosecutor Charles Thomas told the 
court the workers spent their time touting for business, tarmacking and 
block-paving drives across the south of England.

In the evening the workers were forced
to do ‘demeaning domestic chores’ such as sweeping the encampments and 
cleaning out the Connors’ tents and caravans.

They washed twice a week when the Connors took them to leisure centres or swimming pools to freshen up.

Mr Thomas said: 'These two defendants 
were involved in the business of recruiting and running labourers to 
carry out block paving and tarmacking work on driveways.

'Their two victims, to whom the charges relate, make it clear John was the main boss but William was with him all the time.

'The defendants recruited these two 
men, who were vulnerable to exploitation due to their lifestyle and 
circumstances at the time.

'They were socially isolated because 
both had had relationships that had broken down and were no longer in 
contact with those that were around them.

'The defendants took advantage of this and they were effectively forced to carry out work for the defendants’ benefit.

'They were exploited for the financial
gain of the defendants and paid little or no wages for the long hours 
they were required to work.

'The defendants retained the profits 
that were there to be made and John Connors owned an Audi convertible 
car, thought to be worth around £45,000.

'The quality of the cars enjoyed by the defendants was no doubt one of the ways that the profits made by the victims was spent.'

The men were finally rescued when one worker, Victor Romain, 55, broke his silence during a meeting with his probation worker.

He fell into the Connors’ grasp in December 2010 after becoming homeless and estranged from his wife.

Mr Romain said he was punched in the 
head and hit with a shovel by John Connors after he lost £20 for fuel, 
the court heard. His passport and wallet were also taken.

He led police to the men after his probation officer alerted them to his plight.

Mr Thomas said Mr Groombridge had been
tracked down when he left because of his treatment and he was 
threatened with a beating and told he must work off a debt.

He was also forced to fight three rounds with another man and felt he could not refuse.

Mr Thomas said this was an example of the 'coercion, control and intimidation' the Connors had over the men.

Mr Groombridge also told police he was 'worked and ate like a horse' and was taken to a tattoo parlour to have
a tattoo of a Ferrari horse on his back.

Hamble in Hampshire, a well known yachting haven, where the travellers had a 'campsite' in a car park on a trading estate

Police launched a surveillance 
operation on the travellers’ latest 'campsite', which was a car park on a
trading estate in the yachting haven of Hamble, Hampshire.

There officers observed the way the workers were treated and decided to raid the site, which had 17 caravans, on June 24, 2011.

When police raided the camp
the men were living in tents with no running water and had to use the 
woods to go to the toilet.

Meanwhile, the defendants were living 
in luxury caravans with John Connors owning a convertible car worth 
£45,000.

They were able to identify another 
victim - Christopher Groombridge, 31, - who also told of his ordeal at 
the hands of his bosses from February 2011.

Both told police they were paid in tobacco, alcohol and food.

John Connors, from Leighton Buzzard, and William Connors, from Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, gave no comment in police interview.

They went on trial last year accused 
of four charges of holding another person in slavery or servitude but 
the case was abandoned halfway through.

They were due to face a retrial today 
but each admitted two counts of a lesser charge of requiring another 
person to perform forced or compulsory labour.

Michael Epstine, defending John 
Connors, said: 'The victims were given a roof over their head and a bed 
to sleep in rather than a concrete floor or gutter.'

Barry Gilbert, defending William 
Connors, said: 'He was a lieutenant type figure, whose matter in this 
affair was rather limited.'

Judge Peter Henry sentenced a 
tearful John Connors to 40 months imprisonment concurrent for each 
charge and William Connors to 30 months concurrent for each charge.

He said: 'Enforced labour is work or 
services which are extracted from a person under the menace of penalty 
and for which the said person has not offered themselve voluntarily.

'This was a serious offence the exploitation of vulnerable men in such a way that is abhorrent in a civilised society.

'When people have lost their pride and
hope, they are likely to become pathetically reliant on anybody that 
offers them any sort of scraps.

'I’m satisfied the reason these two 
men stayed and did not make further efforts to get away was because they
had that pathetic gratefulness for the things they were given.

'Vulnerable people have to be safeguarded.'

Some men working for the Connors said they were happy with their lot, the court heard.

Sentencing the pair, Judge Peter Henry said the men were vulnerable, had been exploited and humiliated and lived in squalor.

'You both earned considerable money by employing - and I use the word loosely - men to do hard manual labour for you. You had a good and comfortable standard of living.'

The judge dismissed any suggestion the pair had been helping the men.

'It was exploitation of vulnerable men that is abhorrent in a civilised society,' he said.

'When people have lost their dignity and hope they are likely to be pathetically reliant on those who offer them scraps.'
