Police in the California community where a man killed six college students said on Monday they had no grounds to search the 22-year-old suspect's home when they met with him in April over a report that he had posted disturbing videos.

The disclosure that the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department sent deputies to Elliot Rodger's door just weeks before Friday night's shooting rampage has raised questions about whether police could have done more to prevent the attack.

Rodger's mother asked deputies on April 30 to check on him at his apartment in the town of Isla Vista, near the University of California at Santa Barbara, after she saw videos he had posted on the Internet that she found disturbing.

Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said his deputies found Elliot Rodger to be 'polite' when they went to his apartment on April 30

In his 140-page manifesto, Rodger said that 'it would have ended everything' if they had demanded to come inside.

He wrote that officers would have 'found all of my guns and weapons, along with my writings about what I plan to do with them. I would have been thrown in jail, denied of the chance to exact revenge on my enemies.

'I can’t imagine a hell darker than that. Thankfully, that wasn’t the case, but it was so close.'

Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown has said that deputies found Rodger to be polite and courteous during the encounter and that he did not appear to meet the criteria to be held on mental health grounds.

On Monday, sheriff's spokeswoman Kelly Hoover declined to discuss that visit in greater detail, pending an internal investigation, but said that deputies in general were barred from entering a residence without a warrant.

'An exception would be if deputies felt that a person was a harm to themselves or others or there was an immediate threat,' Hoover said.

Elliot Rodger said in his online memoir that if cops had searched his apartment, they would have found his three handguns and his plot to kill

'In this case, we would have had to determine that Elliot Rodger or his roommates were in immediate danger.'

Rodger wrote that he manipulated the officers to get them out of his hair.

'I tactfully told them that it was all a misunderstanding, and they finally left. If they had demanded to search my room… That would have ended everything,' he said in his manifesto.

Authorities say Rodger fatally stabbed three roommates in his apartment before shooting three students to death near the University of California at Santa Barbara. He then shot himself.

The two women and four men who were killed were aged 19 to 22 and students at the school. Thirteen people were wounded, including eight shot by Rodger as he sped through town in his black BMW, exchanging fire with police, authorities said.

'HE WAS JUST VERY QUIET'

Officers found Rodger dead in his car with three legally purchased pistols and more than 400 rounds of ammunition.

Chris Pollard, who lived in the same building as Rodger and knew him before the attacks, told Reuters in an interview that the videos that had concerned his mother should have been red flags for the sheriff's department. 

Sheriff Brown has ordered an internal investigation of how his deputies handled their interaction with Rodger

'When it got to the point that the parents called the police, it makes me wonder if the police even looked at the videos,' Pollard, 22, said.

'If they'd looked at the videos, they could've done some sort of court order to do a search warrant.'

But the young man conceded that deputies would have needed legal grounds to search Rodger or his home and may not have found that justification during their visit to his apartment.

'When you looked at him, there was no reason to get concerned. He didn't seem like a threatening or intimidating guy. He was just very quiet,' Pollard said.

David Dusenbury, a former deputy chief of police in Long Beach, California, said the deputies could have obtained a warrant if the video explicitly threatened violence.

'If the caller said they feared he was going to harm somebody or himself based upon Internet postings, I would say the deputies did not go far enough in their investigation,' Dusenbury said.

He said that deputies could also have run Rodger through their system to learn he had guns registered in his name

The deadly rampage has left the communities of Isla Vista and Santa Barbara reeling. A spokeswoman for Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital said four of the wounded were in good condition and one was in fair condition.

The University of California at Santa Barbara, which is headed into its final exams, canceled classes on Tuesday for a day of mourning.
