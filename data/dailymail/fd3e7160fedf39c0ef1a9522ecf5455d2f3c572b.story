A flooring salesman who left school at 16 is set to become one of Britain’s richest men as he stands to pocket £520million when the firm behind the hit game Candy Crush floats on the stock market.

Mel Morris, a former Derby County FC director, has a 12 per cent stake in King Digital Entertainment - maker of the addictive game involving moving candies to make a line of three in the same colour.

The father-of-two was also behind dating website uDate, launched in 1998, which was sold for £100million in 2003 and netted him £20million, some of which was later invested into King.

Mr Morris, 58, who was born in Littleover, Derbyshire, set up a hardwood flooring firm and property company in Spain upon leaving school - and was a management consultant by the age of 20.

Later on came uDate, whose success was put down to matching innovative technology with a large customer base. Three years after that sale, he was part of a consortium that took over Derby County.

Mr Morris, who is married, then sold his internet security company Prevx in 2010 - which produced anti-virus software for businesses and individuals - for more than £10million to US giant Webroot.

It was only revealed last month that Mr Morris was a significant player in King, after the firm’s filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission named him as chairman of the business.

He is expected to shoot into The Sunday 
Times Rich List - with his £520million from Candy Crush set to put him 
in between the likes of Harry Potter author JK Rowling and entrepreneur 
Peter Jones.

Chief executive: Italian entrepreneur Riccardo Zacconi (pictured), 47, who has led King with Toby Rowland since co-founding the company in Sweden in 2003, will hold a 9.5 per cent stake after the IPO

Mr Morris lived from 1996 to 2004 in a three-bedroom home in an area of Belper, Derbyshire, with an average house value of £470,000, although his residence since then is not known.

King - which gets 78 per cent of its revenue from Candy Crush, the most downloaded free app last year - expects to be worth £4.5billion when going public on the Nasdaq in the US this month.

Candy Crush launched on Facebook in April 2012. The London-based firm’s game was released on Apple devices in November that year, followed by an app for Android devices a month later.

The game - which was the top revenue-grossing app in 2013 - has been downloaded more than 500million times. The basic games are free, but players must pay for add-ons or extra ‘lives’.

Mr Zacconi, who lives in London with 
his Chinese-Swedish wife and son, is in line for a £300million payday. 
He co-founded the firm with Sebastian Knutsson, Thomas Hartwig, Lars Markgren and Patrik Stymne.

The chief
 executive of King - which was originally launched with the idea of 
specialising in games that could be played on Yahoo! - also worked with 
uDate until it was sold in 2003.

Mr Zacconi lived in a three-bedroom flat worth £2.2million in South Kensington, central London, from 2007 to 2010, before moving to a three-bedroom house worth £1.4million in Bayswater, west London.

King
 wants to benefit from focusing on the £10billion market for mobile game
 apps and avoid the fate of rivals such as Zynga, which has struggled to
 make its games as popular on phones as online.

King
 said yesterday that it expects to price its initial public offering 
(IPO) at $21-$24 (£13-14) per share, valuing it slightly higher than 
Hasbro, the 90-year old maker of Monopoly, Scrabble and Nerf.

Twitter’s successful IPO in November and a surge in Facebook’s shares have fuelled speculation of other tech firms going public, including music-streaming service Spotify and lodging website AirBnB.

Stellar popularity has now helped King's revenue grow to £361million in the fourth quarter of 2013 from £13million in the first quarter of 2012.

But most of that growth was fulled by Candy Crush rather than any of the 180 games King provides through mobile phones, Facebook and its own website.

King, which has more than 650 employees, has focused on launching more games on mobile platforms, a market that analysts expect will grow to £10billion this year from just £4billion in 2010.

Big hit: Candy Crush launched on Facebook in April 2012. The London-based firm's game was released on Apple devices in November that year, followed by an app for Android devices a month later

Zynga's stock price has halved since its IPO in 2011 as the popularity of the Farmville game waned, while Finland's Rovio has struggled to replicate the success of Angry Birds.

King's IPO is scheduled to be priced on March 25, and the stock will start trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ‘KING’ on March 26.

Of the 22.2million shares on sale in the offering, the company will sell 15.5million, while stockholders, including Apax Ventures, will sell 6.7million shares, King said.

Unlike most other tech companies that have gone public recently, King is profitable, has no debt and generated positive cash flow from operations for each of the last nine years.

LORD SUGAR

Born to a poor Jewish family in Hackney, east London, Lord Sugar famously started out with just £100 in 1967, selling aerials out of the back of a van.

But he sold his electronics firm Amstrad for £125million in 2007 and now has £150million cash as well as a large property portfolio. Sugar is also known for his catchphrase 'You're fired' on his entrepreneurial BBC TV show The Apprentice.

The 66-year-old former Tottenham Hotspur FC chairman is now in 98th place on The Sunday Times Rich List with an estimated worth of £860million.

DUNCAN BANNATYNE

Former car trader Duncan Bannantyne famously bought an ice cream van for £450 before eventually selling 'Duncan's Super Ices' for £28,000.

The grandfather-of-two, who is known best for featuring on BBC TV show Dragon's Den - for which he is paid £950 a day - also sold his nursing home business for £46million in 1996 and now operates Bannatyne’s Health Clubs.

But the 65-year-old has suffered financial problems and huge company debts more recently, with his divorce from wife Joanne last year costing him £345million.

JULIAN DUNKERTON

Julian Dunkerton, whose plan to become a doctor fell down when he only got three Es at A-level, decided at 19 that he wanted to launch a fashion business.

So he worked in a factory and as a fruit picker to raise enough money to rent a shop, before opening an indoor market stall. His Cheltenham-based business made £16,000 in his first year, 1985 - and his Superdry clothing is now favoured by celebrities including ex-footballer David Beckham and actress Kate Winslet.

The father-of-four now receives a salary of £400,000. Last year his company SuperGroup reported a 22 per cent surge in pre-tax profits and annual revenue of £360million. The 48-year-old is 413rd in The Sunday Times Rich List, with an estimated worth of £197million.
