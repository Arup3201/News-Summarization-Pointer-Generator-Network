Nearly seventeen years ago, former NFL star and actor O.J. Simpson was shockingly acquitted of murdering his ex-wife and her friend.

But now a district attorney at the centre of the case has alleged that Simpson’s lead defence lawyer tampered with a crucial piece of evidence – one of the infamous gloves that prosecutors said linked Simpson to the grisly double-murder of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman.

After The Juice struggled to fit the gloves on his hands – in one of the defining moments of the racially charged trial that captivated the nation – Cochran famously admonished the jury: 'If it doesn't fit, you must acquit.'

Trial run: In the sensational 1995 murder trial, O.J. Simpson tries on a leather glove allegedly used in the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman

Former Los Angeles deputy district attorney Christopher Darden on Thursday accused Simpson defence lawyer, the late Johnnie Cochran, of 'manipulating' the glove, Reuters reported.

On Thursday, during a panel discussion about the trial at Pace Law School in New York City, Darden, a member of the prosecution team, declared: 'I think Johnnie tore the lining.

'There were some additional tears in the lining so that O.J.'s fingers couldn't go all the way up into the glove.'

Darden said in a follow-up interview on Friday that he noticed that when Simpson was trying on a glove for the jury its structure appeared to have changed.

'A bailiff told me the defence had it during the lunch hour.' He said he wasn't specifically accusing anyone, adding: 'It's been my suspicion for a long time that the lining has been manipulated.'

He said he had previously voiced similar concerns in TV interviews, but could not recall the details.Darden's incendiary charge surprised key participants in the trial and related legal action.

Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz, who was a member of Simpson's defence team, and Paul Callan, who represented Nicole Brown Simpson's estate in a successful civil trial against Simpson, said it was the first time they had ever heard the allegation.

On Friday, Dershowitz called the claim that the defence had an opportunity to tamper with the gloves 'a total fabrication' and said 'the defence doesn't get access to evidence except under controlled circumstances.'

'Having made the greatest legal blunder of the 20th Century,' Dershowitz said of Darden, 'he's trying to blame it on the dead man.'

Darden's remarks came after 
Dershowitz, a fellow panellist, called Darden's decision to have Simpson
try on the glove for the first time before the jury 'the most stupid 
thing' a prosecutor could have done.

Dershowitz
said that if Darden had evidence that there had been tampering, he 
would have had an ethical obligation to report the alleged misconduct.

He also questioned why Darden hadn't filed a grievance with the state bar association.

Darden responded by saying that this would have been a 'whiny-little-snitch approach to life' and that was not what he believed in because it didn't change anything.

The event was part of a 'Trials and Errors' series, co-sponsored by Pace Law School and the Forum on Law, Culture & Society at Fordham Law, that examines America's most controversial cases.

Also on the panel were Goldman's father, Fred Goldman, and his sister, Kim Goldman.

Derek Sells, the managing partner of Cochran's old law firm, The Cochran Firm, did not respond to requests for comment. A call to Cochran's daughter, Tiffany Cochran Edwards, who is a communications director for the firm, was not immediately returned. 

Cochran died in 2005 from a brain tumour at age 67.

Simpson was acquitted in the double murder case despite what prosecutors described as a 'mountain of evidence' against him. The evidence included a blood-soaked glove found on Simpson's estate and a matching one found at the scene of the murder.

Questions about the lining of the gloves emerged during the 1995 trial, but they did not involve allegations of tampering by defence lawyers.

Two other members of Simpson's defence team, Robert Shapiro and Barry Scheck, did not return calls for comment. Robert Kardashian and F. Lee Bailey, who also represented Simpson, are both deceased.

A civil jury in 1997 found Simpson liable for the deaths and ordered him to pay $33.5million in damages to the murder victims' families. 

Simpson is currently serving up to 33 years in prison for a 2007 armed robbery in which he claimed he was trying to recover his own sports memorabilia.
