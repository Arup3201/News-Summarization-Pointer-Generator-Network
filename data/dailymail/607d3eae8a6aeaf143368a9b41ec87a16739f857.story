Parents who buy their children tablet computers at Christmas should ensure anti-porn filters are applied, Culture Secretary Maria Miller says.

Tablets such as iPads and Kindles are expected to be one of the top presents this year - with Tesco and Argos coming on the market with cheaper versions.

But the Culture Secretary warned last night that unless parents switch on family filters, their children could stumble across porn and other inappropriate material.

Maria Miller has told parents to ensure anti-porn filters are applied if they buy children tablets for Christmas

The top four internet service providers have agreed to ask all households whether they want to install a filter over the next year, thanks to the intervention of David Cameron and pressure from the Daily Mail.

But until that happens, Mrs Miller said parents had to take the initiative and install filters themselves.

TalkTalk and Sky have already made network filters available, meaning parents do not have to install filters on every separate device. BT and Virgin will follow within the next two months.

A recent Ofcom report showed a dramatic rise in the number of younger children owning tablets. The use of tablet computers has tripled among five to 15-year-olds since 2012 (42 per cent, up from 14 per cent), and 28 per cent of infants aged three to four now use a tablet at home.

Mrs Miller said: ‘Many more children will be unwrapping smartphones and tablet devices on Christmas Day.

‘For parents and children, the internet is fast becoming part of everyday life at work, at school and socially but parents are rightly wary about what children are being exposed to online.

‘We have worked with industry to make it far easier for parents to be confident their children are being protected. Parents need to think about putting filters on their accounts and finding out more about keeping children safe online.’

The four main ISPs - who supply internet connections to almost nine out of 10 UK homes - have agreed that all new broadband customers will have the settings for family friendly filters automatically switched on.

By the end of 2014 all existing customers will have been presented with an unavoidable choice about installing family friendly content filters which the user will not be able to skip. Only the adult account holder will be able to change the filter settings.

Outside the home, all mobile operators have agreed to ensure that adult content is filtered and users will have to prove they are over 18 to switch them off.

Family-friendly filters are now being applied to public wi-fi by the six companies that provide 90% of public wi-fi across the UK.

Last month an expert warned that newly-released tablet computers from Tesco and Argos could put children at risk of stumbling across porn because they do not come fitted with filters.

Tesco has brought out a cheap device called a Hudl, while Argos has introduced MyTablet which is aimed specifically at ‘tweenies’ aged from eight to 13.

Both are expected to be bought by hundreds of thousands of parents for their children at Christmas.

But the Tesco tablet, which retails for just £119, does not come supplied with pre-installed filters which protect against adult materials being viewed by youngsters.

Neither does Argos’s device, costing £100 - despite advertising that it comes with ‘parental controls’.John Carr, from the Children’s Charities’ Coalition on Internet Safety, said he he believed that Tesco had ‘dropped a clanger’, because with the Hudl ‘you can be right in among the hard core porn and all sorts of other kinds of adult content within seconds’.

‘Argos in particular needs to re-examine what they are doing,’ he said. ‘They expressly state that they are going after 8 to 13 year olds.’
