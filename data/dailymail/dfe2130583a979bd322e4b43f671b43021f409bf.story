Almost 50 years ago, Louise Jones was known as the New York City phone booth baby.

And in many ways she continues to be. 

Dumped as a newborn in Manhattan's Upper West Side at about 5.30pm on July 17, 1965, she has learned nothing of her real family for the last 49 years.

And that's not for the sake of trying. 

The one clue she had was a Catholic St. Jude medal pinned to the light blanket she was wrapped in.

Now Jones is ramping up the search for her biological parents, enlisting the help of ABC's 20/20 program and renowned genealogist Pam Slaton. 

Searching for answers: Louise Jones, 49, the youngest woman to hold a seat on the New York Stock Exchange, was dumped in a New York phone booth when she was two days old. She is now trying to find her family

Scene: Louise Jones was dumped in the photo booth on this corner, at 88th St. and Columbus Avenue, New York, on July 17, 1965. She knows nothing of her biological family

She was believed to be just two days old when she was left in the phone booth on the corner of 88th St. and Columbus Avenue. 

A group of people gathered around after noticing the little girl all by herself.

She was in a diaper, rubber pants and the light blanket.

Jones was picked up by a man, Pedro Martinez, who lived nearby, and taken to the 24th precinct police station.

Within days she was adopted.

Jones grew up in Staten Island, with a family she has previously as loving and affectionate, and only found out she was adopted when she was in her early 20s. 

She has been searching for answers ever since, but has not been able to come up with anything.

According to The New York Post, she went on to have her own family and forge a successful career in finance.

She was the youngest woman to hold a seat on the New York Stock Exchange.

But Jones longs to know the real story of where she came from. 

She wants to be able to track down her parents and find out why she was abandoned.

To do that she has hired New Jersey-based Slaton, an adoptee herself who tracked down her own parents 10 years ago.

Happy and successful: Jones grew up in a loving home and went on to have a family of her own and a powerful career, but longs to establish where she came from

Help: Pam Slaton is a genealogist and private investigator who helps adoptees find their parents. However she has so far not been able to help Louise Jones 

Slaton has solved over 3,000 adoptions cases and operates on a 'no find, no fee' policy, where clients don't have to pay if she is unable to track down their families.

So far she has been unable to help Jones.

Even a DNA test failed to help the search.

ABC's magazine program 20/20 is now investigating Jones' case and have asked for any tips to be sent through their website.

The full story will air on Friday November 7 at 10pm.
