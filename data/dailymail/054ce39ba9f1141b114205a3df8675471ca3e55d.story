Arrested: Richard Moller, 50, was arrested by Boulder police, Colorado, after he allegedly beat a raccoon to death and injured another in a revenge attack for the slaughter of his cat

A 50-year-old man allegedly beat two raccoons - one fatally - with a nail-studded plank of wood because he harboured loathing for the species which killed his cat years ago.

Richard Moller, from Boulder, Colorado, claimed in an arrest affidavit he saw an 'opportunity' to kill the raccoons as 'revenge' for the slaughter of his cat.

The two raccoons were in a large dumpsterÂ  when Moller spotted them, and he allegedly jumped inside, according to the Boulder Daily Camera.

He then picked up a piece of nail-studded wood and started beating the animals, the news service said.

An eye witness said he could hear the raccoons 'screaming and moaning' as Moller was allegedly 'pushing nails into the animals,' the Daily Camera reported.

The witness intervened and yelled at Moller, but his response was: 'All raccoon must die,' the news service said.

He then allegedly jumped out and walked away from the scene.

Police caught up with Moller and searched the dumpster.

Inside they found one dead raccoon and another injured animal, which ran away before they could catch it. They also found a three-foot plank with nails sticking out of it.

In a police interview, Moller claimed he had watched raccoons kill his cat years ago, the news service said.

According to the police affidavit, officers found one raccoon dead in the dumpster, another injured one ran away. They also found a plank of wood with nails in it

When he saw the two animals in the 
dumpster his anger took over and he told police it was his 'opportunity 
to kill the raccoons'.

He claimed he didn't use the side of the board with nails sticking out to hit the animals.

Moller faces two counts of felony animal cruelty, the news service said, adding that on Tuesday he remained at the Boulder jail on $100 bond. He is due to appear in court today.
