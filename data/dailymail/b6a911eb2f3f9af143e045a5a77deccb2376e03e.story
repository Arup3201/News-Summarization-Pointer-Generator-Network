Two British Olympic sailing silver medallists  were violently mugged at knife-point in Rio de Janeiro on Wednesday - where they have been practising ahead of the city's 2016 games.

Hannah Mills and Saskia Clark were targeted as they walked from the sailing club back to their hotel in what they described as a 'bad area' of Rio.

The athletes, who took silver in the Women's 470 class at London 2012, spoke of the terrifying incident on Facebook, saying they were pushed around by two men both wielding 7in knives - with the muggers even stealing the lycra they train in.

They wrote on Facebook: 'Our delightful walk back from the sailing club to the hotel turned fairly nasty when two guys wielding 7inch knives ran at us, pushed us around and grabbed everything we had.

'Along with the things that were actually worth something, the most annoying thing right now is our lycra we were sailing in got taken....unbelievable!!

'Anyway, we made it back to the hotel slightly shaken but all okay.'

Jo Aleh, who won gold in the Women's 470 sailing class at London 2012, replied to the post saying: 'Glad you are okay! We've all been warned so much about it, but a little freaky when the warnings are true!'

Rio will be the first South American city to host the Olympics but there are concerns over safety and the quality of the sailing conditions - with many athletes calling the water filthy.

Training: The talented pair were photographed in action in Rio de Janeiro in August this year

Winning bronze in this year's World Championships in Santander in September meant Team GB qualify for the 470 women's category in Rio in 2016.

Ms Mills later referred to Wednesday's experience as horrible and added that the area is known for being dangerous.

Speaking to WalesOnline, she said: 'We are pretty shaken up. It takes time to get over something like this.

The British sailing team broke news of their terrifying ordeal to friends on Facebook

Wake-up call: Hannah Mills said the area is known for being dangerous and the incident was 'a big wake-up call to the reality of being in Rio and what it's like in certain places'

'We were walking back from the sailing club at 5.30pm in the evening and these two guys came running at us from behind. 

'We are staying positive and looking forward to continue training out here. It's quite a big wake-up call to the reality of being in Rio and what it's like in certain places.'

But she added that their experience of the city had so far been overwhelmingly positive.
