The Queen's bank has denied claims in European newspapers that Osama Bin Laden ever held an account with the organisation.

The accusation follows an operation by German customs officials seized documents from the Caymen Island branch of Coutts as it arrrived in Hamburg port.

The two containers inspected by German officials contained an estimated 14,000 documents. The officials moved in to discover details of suspected tax evasion by German nationals.

Coutts recently closed its branch in the Caribbean tax haven and was transferring the information to a special data centre in Geneva.

According to the Daily Telegraph, European newspapers claimed that account details relating to Bin Laden and his family were among the documents seized in Hamburg.

However Coutts denied they ever had a relationship with the terror leader.

A spokesperson for the private bank said: 'We are not aware of any investigation into our trust company or its papers and we are working with the authorities to allow these papers to continue on their way.

'At no time have we ever looked after the financial affairs of Osama bin Laden or his immediate family. His individual financial affairs have never been an issue or interest of Coutts.'

Bin Laden came from an incredibly wealthy family in Saudi Arabia that made its fortune in construction. His father, Mohammed, who died in 1967, had close links to the Saudi Royal Family. He had more than 50 children from 22 wives.

However, it is understood that Osama Bin Laden had been disowned and cut off from any inheritance by the mid 1990s because of his links to terrorism.

His eldest son Abdullah is understood to run an advertising agency in Saudi Arabia and has no links to extremism.

Bin Laden was stripped of his Saudi citizenship in 1994.

He had at least five wives, but was only living with three of them when he killed by US Special Forces in Pakistan.

It is understood that he had at least 20 children.

Coutts has catered for the Royal Family since 1692 and in recent decades has encouraged 'new money'.

The Beatles, Sting, and Sir Elton John are understood to have opened accounts there.

But its closely guarded reputation has been tainted in more recent years.

It was fined £8.75million in 2012 for ‘serious and systematic’ failings when handling money from suspected criminals or foreign despots.

City regulators criticised the bank for taking ‘an unacceptable risk of handling the proceeds of crime’.

Between 2007 and 2010 staff at the bank failed to check the source of funds when prospective clients tried to open accounts.

As a result, money could have come from high-risk countries including Libya, Syria and Zimbabwe.
