Malaysia Airlines has removed and apologised for a tweet promoting its end of year sales that was slammed on social media tweet for being insensitive to the missing MH370 flight. 

Part of a series of efforts to promote deals on the beleaguered airline's routes up to June 2015, its official Twitter account @MAS posted: 'Want to go somewhere, but don't know where? Our Year-End Specials might just help! #keepflying'.

Followers were quick to show their outrage at the post, drawing the unfortunate connection to the MH370 flight.

MAS apologises for their tweet: 'Want to go somewhere, but don't know where? Our Year-End Specials might just help! #keepflying'

The airline removed the original tweet but continued to suffer criticism from Twitter users

The airline's Boeing 777 flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing disappeared on March 8 with 227 passengers from 15 countries and 12 Malaysia Airlines crew on board and remains missing. 

MAS removed the post and tweeted: 'Our tweet was intended to inspire travellers to explore deals offered. We apologize for any offence caused & have removed it!'

Theresa Powell tweeted the airline on Thursday from @tpowellwow, saying: 'probably not the best choice of words for an airline that doesn't know where one of its planes is- just saying #mas370'.

Malaysia Airlines has posted numerous tweets promoting their sales and its #keepflying campaign

But only when they wrote 'Want to go somewhere, but don't know where?' was it considered offensive

Others weren't so savoury in their criticism of the airline. 

After removing the initially offensive tweet, Malaysia Airlines responded to its critics while retweeting a post from Jonathan Wong's @jono_dubs: 'Don't understand all the haters blasting #mas for their promotions? Some people are trying'

MAS replied, 'Thanks for your support'.

Malaysia Airlines has been on thin ice in its bid to win over customers and repair their image after two tragedies in a year. 

The company is also trying to overcome millions in revenue losses following the MH370 and MH17 tragedies.

This is the second social media gaffe that has struck a nerve, with the previous one promoting 'My Ultimate Bucket List' deemed inappropriate by many who connected it with light MH17, which saw the death of 289 people on board after it was shot down over Ukraine in July.

MAS pulled that campaign following the backlash due to bucket list's meaning of things to do before you die.

MH17 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur crashed on July 17, 2014, believed to have been shot down near Torez, Ukraine, killing all 298 on board. The plane’s debris landed an area controlled by pro-Russian separatists, who American and German intelligence sources say shot it down with Buk surface-to-air missile. Russia blames the Ukrainian government.

MH370 disappeared on March 8, 2014, en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. The last message to air traffic control came at an hour after takeoff and it was last seen on radar at an hour later over the Andaman Sea, 200 miles from Penang state in northwestern Malaysia. The Boeing 777 was carrying 227 passengers from 15 countries and 12  crew.
