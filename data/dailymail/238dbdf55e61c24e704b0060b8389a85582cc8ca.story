The head honchos of national burrito chain Chipotle have apologized following an incident in which a single Brooklyn location employee raised his arms in a one man-protest against uniformed NYPD customers.

The 'hands up, don't shoot' gesture got nine officers in such a tizzy December 16, they turned heel and left the store.

Contrary to an internet rumor gone viral, however, they were not refused service at the Brooklyn  eatery.

A lone worker's act: This Chipotle location in Brooklyn, New York came under fire after an employee raised his hands in a 'don't shoot' protest gesture as nine NYPD cops walked in

'We work very hard to ensure that every customer in our restaurants feels welcome and is treated with respect,' said co-CEO’s Steve Ells and Monty Moran in a statement Monday. 'Clearly, the actions of this crew member undermined that effort.' 

It was an almost unavoidable response from the company's top brass after pro-NYPD groups became enraged both with news of the employee's seemingly tasteless act and with the subsequent untrue reports that the Brooklyn store refused to serve the men in blue.

The amplifying effect of social media and blogs even led to suggestions the Chipotle company itself is somehow anti-police.

Hands up: The employee took it upon himself to raise his hands in the now ubiquitous anti-police brutality gesture, but in an apology released by company co-CEOs, Chipotle said it did not reflect on the chain's beliefs

Pointing toward a decidedly unofficial Facebook page named Thank You NYPD that claimed 'an officer was in fact refused service at Chipotle,' as evidence, Twitter user @ChuckCJohnson posted the Brooklyn store's phone number in apparent attempt to get his 20,000 followers to harass its employees.

All of that, of course, because of one employee's self-motivated act.

'We have conducted a review of the incident including interviews with the crew and a review of video footage from security cameras,' read Chipotle's CEO's statement, obtained by the New York Daily News.

They continued: 'Our investigation has shown that this appears to have been a spontaneous, unplanned action taken by an individual crew member and was not a coordinated effort by the staff of the restaurant.'

As the News points, this incident occurred at the very same store once known to be frequented by area cops because of a 'prohibited and unofficial' 50 percent discount officers were being given.

From a 2012 New York Times article:

'The crowd at lunch and dinner is peppered with officers: some at tables, more in line and some carrying to-go bags. They are drawn by burritos and tacos, the proximity to Brooklyn’s courthouses and an unadvertised special: a 50 percent discount given to officers in uniform.

'Many of the police officers who eat there may not have been aware of the discount, the restaurant’s general manager, Gonzalo Romero, said. Some express surprise when their bill comes to half of the advertised price. “When they see it, they go, ‘Thank you very much,’ ” he said.'

Police officers are banned from receiving gratuities for their services. When asked by the Times about the Brooklyn Chipotle's hefty discount, the store's manager referred to it instead as a 'courtesy.'
