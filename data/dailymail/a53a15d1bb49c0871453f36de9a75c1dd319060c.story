The recent miseries of Hereford United reached a new low on Wednesday after the club were suspended by the FA and ordered to stop ‘all football activity’.

Their latest crisis strikes with depressing timing, coming just two days after the draw for the third round of the FA Cup — the competition in which Hereford achieved the most famous Cup upset of all against Newcastle in 1972.

The game’s authorities acted after one of the financially stricken club’s shareholders, Alan McCarthy, was charged with acting as an officer for Hereford without written confirmation from the FA to do so.

It’s awful news. In my long experience and years in football I cannot recall such an occasion. It’s bad.

Since I joined the club in 1971 and before then, Hereford were well run by local businessmen with the interests of the club at heart. It was always one of the best-run clubs in non-League football. 

They attracted bigger crowds and bigger names — the man who brought me in was the great John Charles.

But for one reason or another it’s gone away from that in the last few years. It is really sad. I’m a member of the Supporters’ Trust and I try to keep on top of what is going on — it’s not been nice to follow.

I was with Ronnie Radford just a couple of weeks ago filming something for the BBC about the FA Cup — it’s a shame to go from that to this. We are all scattered far and wide from that side but the club remains a big part of us.

What has happened has shocked me but I can’t say it has surprised me. What I hope happens now is that the club is eventually passed into the hands of the Supporters’ Trust. 

It can work when you do it that way. I certainly can’t see a shining knight coming in.

Ricky George scored the famous second goal in the 2-1 win when non-League Hereford knocked out First Division Newcastle in the FA Cup third round in 1972.

Hereford’s new majority shareholder, Andy Lonsdale, is understood to be confident that the situation will be resolved today and the sanction removed immediately.

But the saga represents a humiliating low for the club, which is believed to owe £1.5million and is due at the High Court in London on Monday to contest a winding-up petition.

The local council also confirmed it is ‘thoroughly re-examining’ the terms of the lease of the Edgar Street ground as the club fights to save its future.

Martin Watson, vice-chairman of the Hereford United Supporters’ Trust, told Sportsmail: ‘The winding-up petition is the real worry.

‘This suspension is not what anyone wanted but the FA should have done something here a long time ago.

‘It should not have come to the situation that the club are in.’ 

Cash-strapped Hereford were expelled from the Football Conference in June for failing to pay creditors

The club have been based at their Edgar Street home since 1924 but now face an uncertain future

The court date will come only six months after Hereford were expelled from the Conference over their failure to clear debt and deposit a £350,000 bond.

They have since found themselves in the Southern League Premier Division — the seventh tier of English football — and a supporter protest against the running of the club has seen their average gate fall from 1,758 last season to little more than 400.

Lonsdale, who took over the club on Wednesday having previously been chairman, has promised significant investment to keep them afloat.

But supporters are hugely sceptical and critical of a man who had 21 appointments at 17 dissolved companies and was disqualified from being a company director from October 2006 for six years. 

Despite the growing uncertainty over the 90-year-old club’s future, Hereford assistant manager Neil Phelps insisted on Wednesday that Hereford are continuing to prepare for their fixture at Dunstable on Saturday.

He said: ‘We’re still training full-time and still expecting a game Saturday.’

In revealing their decision to suspend Hereford, an FA statement read: ‘Having failed to comply with the orders of the independent regulatory commission, both Hereford United and Alan McCarthy are suspended from all football and football activity with immediate effect.

‘The FA understands the importance of football clubs to their local communities and will continue to work with all relevant parties to ensure senior football returns to Hereford at the earliest opportunity, although this will be contingent on the club complying with the regulations and subsequent orders of the independent regulatory commission.’
