Luis Suarez has returned to training with Barcelona after scoring in Uruguay's 3-3 draw with Costa Rica.

Defenders Thomas Vermaelen and Jeremy Mathieu also took part in the training session while Andres Iniesta completed individual exercises as he continued his recovery from injury.

Rafinha and Martin Montoya are the other names on Barcelona's injury list.

Uruguay's Luis Suarez has returned to training with Barcelona and won't feature for his country against Chile

Suarez was available to feature in Uruguay's friendly against Chile on Wednesday, but national coach Oscar Tabarez chose instead to send him back to Spain.

The 27-year-old's nine-match ban will prevent him from playing in next summer's Copa America and Tabarez wants his side to practise playing without their talisman. 

Uruguay captain Diego Godin said: 'We all know what Luis means to us, but we also know that we won't have him for the Copa America, so it's good to look at alternatives for playing without him.'
