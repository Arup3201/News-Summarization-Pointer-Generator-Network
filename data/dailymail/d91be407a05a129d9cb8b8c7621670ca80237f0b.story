A health care worker returning from Sierra Leone has sparked a new Ebola scare in the US after she was pulled off a United Airlines flight in Newark and rushed to the hospital on Monday.

The woman, whose name has not been released, reportedly vomited aboard United flight 45 from Brussels and suffered from a high fever - both early signs of the deadly disease. 

She is currently at Hackensack University Medical Center, undergoing tests for Ebola - though doctors said she no longer had a fever when she arrived at the hospital and is no longer showing signs of infection.

Health workers in hazmat suits met the passenger on the plane at Newark Liberty International Airport on Monday afternoon

The woman was taken off and sent to Hackensack University Medical Center, whe she was tested for Ebola and was being held on Tuesday

The woman is reportedly a health worker who was returning from the Ebola-afflicted nation of Sierra Leone in West Africa

She was being kept at the hospital on Tuesday 'in an abundance of caution.'

The Bergen County Record reports that the woman was returning to the US from Sierra Leone, a West African nation where health workers are still working to bring Ebola under control. 

The virus has infected an estimated 10,000 people there and killed more than 3,000. 

Passengers told the Record that healthcare workers in hazmat suits met the plane when it landed about 2pm on Monday. 

E.E. Charlton-Trujillo, who was on the flight, said neither airline officials nor health authorities offered an explanation for what happened on the plane, but fear quickly spread through the cabin. 

'Everyone’s thinking Ebola,' she told the Record. 

They took the woman off the flight and then had the remaining 261 passengers and crew members fill out health care forms and gave them contact numbers for public health officials. 

Authorities stressed that even if the woman tests positive for Ebola, it's highly unlikely that she would have infected anyone else aboard.  

Doctors say the woman no longer had a fever when she arrived at Hackensack University Medical Center 

Passengers were given health forms to fill out and told the contact health officials if they experienced any symptoms of the virus

As of this month, the World Health Organization says at least 8,594 people have died in the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. 

In Liberia there were 3,587 deaths. Sierra Leone had 3,132 deaths and Guinea 1,875 deaths.

The current outbreak, which began about a year ago, has also claimed more than a dozen lives elsewhere.

The death toll from the current Ebola outbreak has reached 8,594 people with as many as 21,614 infected according to the World Health Organization.

It describes Ebola symptoms as the sudden onset of fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. This is followed by vomiting, diarrhea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding.

The infection is transmitted by direct contact with the blood, bodily fluids and tissues of infected animals or people. 

And people remain infectious as long as their blood and secretions contain the virus. 

There is no known cure or vaccine for the disease but the incubation period is two to 21 days.
