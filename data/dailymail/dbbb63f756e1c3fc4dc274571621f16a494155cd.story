It’s a sight that is bound to bring arachnophobes out in a cold sweat – but this spectacular web is not the work of spiders.

The 11-foot long web was actually spun by cotoneaster caterpillars.

The silk-like material, used to protect larvae from predators, has appeared in the garden of Huddersfield couple, John and Jackie Morris.

Astonishing: The huge web has enveloped an entire hedge in the back garden of the home of John and Jackie Morris in Huddersfield

The pair discovered the strange, sticky substance, which looks like something from a sci-fi film, on their rose bush.

Mr Morris a long-distance driver, said: ‘The neighbours think it’s really fascinating.

‘I haven’t heard anyone else mention seeing any in the area.

Larvae-ly effort: The 11-foot long web was spun by cotoneaster caterpillars

‘It started a couple of weeks ago and it’s got bigger and bigger.

‘We’re not really bothered about it being there. Once the young hatch it disperses in the weather.’

Gardening expert Graham Porter said: ‘It is unusual in the north of England.

‘The females lay eggs on plants in July and August, with young caterpillars mining into leaves in autumn where they remain until spring when they emerge and spin the webbing and feed in the leaves. They pupate [the non-feeding stage between larva and adult] on the webbing in June and July.’

Cotoneaster caterpillars are the larval stages of the Hawthorn moth, which has a year-long life cycle.

The foliage becomes brown and dried up where small, dark brown caterpillars have grazed away the leaf surface.

Sizing things up: John and Jackie Morris said the web first appeared two weeks ago and has just kept growing

Hawthorn moth larvae cover their feeding area with a fine white silk webbing.

The young caterpillars resume feeding in late spring, when the webbing and damage becomes more extensive and noticeable.

When fully fed in early summer, the caterpillars pupate within the silk webbing.

Cotoneaster moth caterpillars are 12-15mm long when fully grown and they produce extensive white silk webbing that covers their feeding area.
