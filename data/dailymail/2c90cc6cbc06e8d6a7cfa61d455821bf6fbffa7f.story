England's James Willstrop and Daryl Selby have won bronze in the men's doubles squash after defeating Scotland's Harry Leitch and Alan Clyne at Scotstoun on the final day of the Commonwealth Games.

Willstrop and Selby came through a hard-fought match to take a 11-9 11-7 in a match time of one hour 19 minutes.

Willstrop asked the match referee to tell the audience to try and silence their screaming children midway through a tense opening game before the Scottish duo edged 7-5 in front.

The English duo moved ahead before there was a short break after Selby accidentally smashed his racquet into Clyne's face, forcing the Scot to replace his visor, but Willstrop and Selby continued their comeback to take the first game.

A closely-fought second was also won by the England pair in front of the Scottish crowd.

Earlier, top seeds Kasey Brown and Cameron Pilley from Australia defeated number two seeds Joelle King and Martin Knight of New Zealand 8-11 11-9 11-8 in a mammoth match time of one hour and 20 minutes to win mixed doubles bronze.

'This is our Olympics - it is the biggest stage that we can perform on,' Selby said after winning bronze.

'I didn't get a chance to perform last week in the singles so this was my personal chance and our chance together to show what we can do and get a Commonwealth medal.

'It is something I can say now that I am a Commonwealth medallist and it ticks a box for me - it's a nice feeling.'

Willstrop added: 'This was about as special as any of my Commonwealth medals.

'It is great to do it with a friend and with someone you have worked hard with.

'All of last summer and this summer we have worked hard on doubles and we have known each other for years, so of course it is special.

'We play singles all the time and we are training to be good at that, but, to do it with someone else, it has been a great experience.'
