An intoxicated Illinois man who refused to pay his taxi fare after having sex in the back seat was forced to use his mother's credit to cover his debt.

The taxi driver called police when Andrew Vukovich, 27, and Stefanie Herringer, 31, who were picked up outside Toby Keith's I Love This Bar and Grill in Rosemont on February 9, wouldn't pay the $83 charge.

Driver Faisal Kokazeh, 28, said the lovebirds had spent the 40-minute journey to the home Vukovich shared with his mom in Orland Park making love after the couple took off most of their clothes.

Their kind of place? The pair were drinking at the Rosemont, Illinois location of Toby Keith's I Love This bar and Grill when driver Faisal Kokazeh picked them up

Chicago Tribune reported that cops to the 15500 block of Sunset Ridge Drive encountered two incoherent passengers and clothing 'strewn throughout the taxi'.

Vukovich eventually agreed to cover his bill, using his mother's credit card, before leaving Herringer to find her own way home.

Police said they took the Herringer back to the police station, where her brother picked her up.

She was from Elgin, about an hour drive from Orland Park.Â 

Unamused: Faisal Kokazeh said he watched the pair 'perform intercourse in the back' of his minivan taxicab before they refused to pay. He said Vukovich was eventually able to pay with his mom's credit card
