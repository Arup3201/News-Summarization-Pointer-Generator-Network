A schoolboy who was hit by two cars was left lying in the road by the first driver - before the second began demanding cash for his damaged vehicle.

Myles Knowles, 15, was crossing the road on his bike near the Cineworld cinema in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, when he was hit by a white Ford Fiesta, before being thrown into the path of a red Audi.

Both cars sped off before the Audi returned and parked nearby.

Teenager Myles Knowles has been sent a series of text messages, left and right, which included threats and demands for cash to repair one of the cars that hit him as he was crossing the road

The driver and two passengers then asked Myles if he was all right before asking for his mobile phone number.

Now the teenager, who needed hospital treatment, says that he has been sent several text messages demanding money for repairs to the damaged Audi.

One messages urges the youngster to pay up in excess of  £200 for the damage to the car. Another demands money before asking: 'Or shall I call round to see someone?'

Mother Carol, 44, rushed to the scene along with police and ambulance crews as the youngster - who was with a friend at the time of the incident - slipped in and out of consciousness at the roadside.

He was discharged from hospital around eight hours later and, incredibly, suffered only minor injuries to his legs.

His furious mother, of Ashton-under-Lyne, said she had been 'appalled' by the reaction of the drivers and other motorists.

'It's shocking,' she said. 'Not only did the driver of the first car not stop but the second driver has shown more concern for his own vehicle than Myles' welfare - some of the texts have been quite threatening.

'No other drivers stopped at the scene either.

'Considering a 15-year-old boy had just been hit by two cars you'd have thought someone would at least check to see he was alright.

'It was upsetting seeing him by the side of the road and it was very lucky he wasn't more seriously injured.

'It's a busy area and I'm hoping someone will have seen something at the time which can help the police find the driver who didn't stop.'

The New Charter Academy pupil has been on crutches and left unable to eat full meals since the crash.

He said: 'I'm still quite shaken up by it all and I can't put any pressure on my legs yet.

'The cars came from nowhere and I don't remember much of what happened afterwards.'

Police say they are investigating the incident, which took place at 6.15pm on Wednesday.
