Missing: Sam Swain with his beloved bike which was stolen in Bristol

A cyclist who travelled 10,000 miles across Europe and Asia on his bike was devastated when it was stolen after arriving back in the UK.

Sam Swain, 22, took his Dawes Super Galaxy hybrid touring bike from Ireland to Japan - through Turkey and Iran - before riding it to India and Thailand.

He then cycled through Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, China and South Korea on the sturdy two-wheeler to fulfill a childhood dream.

But after he returned to Britain his beloved bronze-coloured bicycle was stolen from a bike rack just yards from where he works.

The restaurant waiter, who had locked up the bike, said: 'We cycled 
from Ireland to Japan, across Europe and Asia, with no problems 
throughout that trip.

'We come back to England and my bike gets stolen.'

Mr Swain completed the ten-month inter-continental journey with his father Mark, 54, last year.

The
£1,000 bike was stolen at 8.30pm on June 1 from a rack in Bristol’s 
Quakers Friars as Sam was at work in nearby Italian restaurant 
Carluccio’s.

As soon as he realised the bike had gone he reported the theft to a Cabot Circus security guard.

Staff
found CCTV footage of a woman with a boy aged about 13 by the bike and 
the same boy riding off on it while the woman left on foot.

The footage was passed on to police but they later told Sam there was a 'slim chance' of recovering the bike.

He was told an officer would be assigned to the case but has yet to hear back from anyone.

Mr Swain said: 'It really annoys me because there’s footage of the person stealing it but little prospect of getting it back.

'There seems no point in having security cameras and patrols in Cabot Circus if they can’t crack down on it straight away.'

'CCTV of the incident is being examined to try and identify the person who stole the bike in order that they can be dealt with and the bike recovered.

'The theft of bikes is taken seriously and we would encourage anyone who knows people who steal or handle stolen bikes to get in touch with us.'
