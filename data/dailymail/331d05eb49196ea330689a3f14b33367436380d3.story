The father of an 11-month-old girl who died after being found in a gas-filled home has been released from police custody after he was questioned over the sudden death.

Lai Chun Fung and his daughter were found by the baby's mother Si Yen Yong when she returned to their Harrisdale home, south east of Perth, at 10pm on Wednesday night.

Ms Yong was captured on CCTV cameras frantically driving her unconscious daughter to a nearby 24-hour gym at Canning Vale in the hope of getting help.

Despite desperate attempts by gym members and paramedics, the girl couldn't be revived.

The child was taken to Armadale Hospital where she later died.

Police said they were treating the death as a suspected homicide and released the father without charge after questioning on Friday.

A post mortem examination will be conducted next week to see if the gas fumes killed the girl.

Ryan Shreeve, who was at the gym when Ms Yong sped into the car park screaming for help, called triple-0 and checked the baby's pulse but 'there was nothing there'.

'I just ran to help her, I did what I could,' Mr Shreeve told Nine News.

'She said "the baby's dead... help me, help me, take me to the hospital".

'(There was) no breathing, no nothing. (The mother) was hysterical.

'The look in the mother's eyes, I just wanted to ensure this baby left alive.'

Despite desperate attempts by gym members and paramedics, the girl couldn't be revived and was pronounced dead at Armadale Hospital

A separate ambulance took the unconscious father from the family home to Royal Perth Hospital.

When he was discharged he was taken into police custody and later released.

Neighbours reported a strong smell of gas coming from the home.

The investigation continues.
