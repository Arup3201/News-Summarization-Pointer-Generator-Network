A 12-year-old boy who collapsed and ended up in a coma after attempting a bizarre craze called ‘thumb blowing', it was revealed today.

Sam Thomas, of Newquay, Cornwall, copied an online video showing people how to put their thumbs in their mouth, squeeze their chest and blow through their fingers until they hyperventilate.

He blacked out while trying to perform the dangerous stunt with friends, before managing to get back to his feet and staggering to school. But he soon felt pins and needles and started to feel faint.

Sam’s parents Celia, 43, and Robert Thomas, 47, rushed to the school to find their son’s body was ‘shutting down’ - and he was taken to hospital where doctors feared he would suffer brain damage.

They had to put Sam in a medically-induced coma while they ran further tests. He was in the coma for 36 hours and has since recovered - but his family have issued a warning against the craze.

Mr Thomas said: ‘I picked him up and he had no blue in his eyes, they were all black. There was nothing I could do to help him. He didn’t know who I was, he couldn’t talk, couldn’t walk.

‘We went to the doctors and they called an ambulance. They needed to know more about what happened as they were really worried.’

His family sat at his bedside as doctors waited to see if he had suffered permanent brain damage.

Mrs Thomas said: ‘He needed neurological rest but they couldn’t assure us he was going to be OK. We didn’t know if he was going to wake up knowing us. It was a long 36 hours.

‘The next day they came to wake him but 
he took a while to come round and he didn’t talk for a while. We had 
never heard of this "thumb blowing" craze before - that’s also what was 
really worrying.

‘We were in disbelief that this could be so dangerous. It’s caused death before and many more children have suffered brain damage. Children at that age don’t understand things like this.

‘There’s no fear or danger. It’s really important children understand the risks and we’d encourage parents to talk to their children about this. I’m not angry or cross, because children are children. But no one wants to go through the 36 hours we did.’

Sam is slowly recovering from his ordeal but has had to cut down on playing sports. His parents are now warning other youngsters of the perils of copying dangerous fainting games they see online.

Various versions of the stunt are listed online - known by a variety of names. They involve hyperventilating or squeezing the carotid artery in the neck.

A spokesman for Sam’s school Newquay Tretherras Academy said it had acted ‘instantly’ to warn pupils not to try the stunt.
