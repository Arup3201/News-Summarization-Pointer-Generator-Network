A passenger plane has been forced to divert after another bomb threat was made on Twitter, just 24 hours after similar messages forced fighter jets to escort two flights. 

The Delta Air Lines flight from Los Angeles to Orlando landed in Dallas on Sunday afternoon because of a 'security concern'.

However reports from passengers on board the flight suggest the pilot told them because it was of concerning posts on social media.

Bomb threat: The Delta Air Lines flight from Los Angeles to Orlando landed in Dallas on Sunday afternoon because of a 'security concern'. Passengers have said the threat was made on Twitter. One of them (above) was directed at the airline

Concerning: Another message from the account claimed there were 'soldiers' on the flight 

A tweet was sent out from the twitter handle @AllahuAhkbar911, which is now a suspended account, to various groups including @FoxNews and @DeltaAssist.

One of the tweets stated in all caps: @FOXNEWS WE HAVE PLANTED EXPLOSIVES ON DELTA FLIGHT #1061 FROM LA TO ORLANDO, WE ARE ISIS, WE ARE HERE, YOU WONT BE.'

The account uses a picture of Junaid Hussain, the man believed to be behind the hacking of the Pentagon's Twitter account earlier this month.

He is a 20-year-old British man who allegedly moved to Syria to help jumpstart ISIS’s hacking efforts. 

Delta spokesman Morgan Durrant said passengers on Flight 1061 got off the Boeing 737-900 so authorities could search the aircraft. 

The airline continued the flight when authorities determined it was safe to do so. 

A tweet from a Los Angeles NBC affiliate said that a sports producer on board the plane at the time had been told he was disembarking because of a bomb threat.

Two planes were also evacuated upon arrival at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on Sunday due to what a spokesman called a 'security concern', however the details of these are unknown. 

Airport spokesman Perry Cooper says a JetBlue flight from Long Beach, California, and a regional SkyWest jet from Phoenix were the planes involved. The flights arrived late Sunday afternoon.

Journey: Passengers re-boarded the plane at Dallas after the plane was searched and no threat was found

On board: One passenger on Delta Flight 1061 confirmed they had been rerouted to Dallas because of a threat made on Twitter 

Cooper said that as a precaution, passengers were bused to their gates from the airport's third runway. He said the matter was under investigation and that he did not have further details.

Additionally, a Delta Air Lines spokesman says a flight from Los Angeles to Orlando was diverted to Dallas Sunday afternoon due to 'a security concern. 

Laura Eimiller, a spokeswoman for the FBI in Los Angeles, said online threats targeted the JetBlue and Delta flights. 

She said there was no known threat to any aircraft that departed from the Los Angeles area and that as part of the investigation agents will determine whether the threats were related.

The flight disruptions come a day after bomb threats targeted two jets bound for Atlanta, prompting F-16 fighter jets to escort the planes. 

The threats posted on the social media network Twitter targeted Southwest Airlines Flight 2492, which arrived at Atlanta from Milwaukee; and Delta Air Lines Flight 1156, which arrived from Portland, Oregon.

It was unclear if any of threats were connected.
