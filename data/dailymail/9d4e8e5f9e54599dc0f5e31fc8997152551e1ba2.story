Donald Sterling will not be able to buy his way out of his racism scandal as a handful of charities have publicly declared that they will no longer be accepting money from the LA Clippers owner.

UCLA has even decided to reject a $3million gift that he gave to support the school's kidney research program.

The $3million pledge was spread over years, so the school has only received the $425,000 initial payment- which it will return- and the rest was due to come in installments- which have now been cancelled.

Rejected: Donald Sterling, who was issued a lifetime ban from the NBA, has had his charitable donations returned

'Mr. Sterling’s divisive and hurtful comments demonstrate that he does not share UCLA’s core values as a public university that fosters diversity, inclusion and respect,' University spokesman Phil Hampton said in a statement according to CBS Los Angeles.

The gift was specifically earmarked for the work being done by Dr Ira Kurtz, who was trying to learn about the structural properties of key proteins in the kidney which could lead to development of targeted drugs.

UCLA had by far the biggest gift to give back, but other area charities are now facing the decision of what to do with their donations.

TMZ reported that the Goodwill of Southern California was promised a $100,000 gift over ten years, and decided to return the $20,000 it had already received and stop the future payments.

Cause above all: The Union Rescue Mission is keeping their annual $10,000 donations from Sterling, saying 'We take money from all kinds of bad people all the time'

Cutting it off: A Place Called Home, which runs homeless shelters for high risk teens, was $30,000 into a planned $100,000 gift and they announced that they will keep the money they have received but reject the future payments

A Place Called Home, which runs homeless shelters for high risk teens, had a similar payment plan set up and have already received $30,000 from the embattled billionaire.

They decided to keep the money they have already received but reject the $70,000 that is scheduled to come.

Others have decided that their causes need the money more than the symbolism of returning the funds.

That is true for the Temple of the 
Arts which is keeping $10,000 and the L.A. Union Rescue Mission which 
has been receiving $10,000 from Sterling for an unspecified number of 
years.

'We take money from all kinds of bad people all the time,' a spokesman told TMZ.

The American Diabetes Association had a
 similar, though more diplomatic, explanation for why they have decided 
to keep the $25,000 that he has donated.

'The sad reality is that without donations like Mr. Sterling's, we can't help the people that we do,' a spokesman said.

Not afraid to stand out: Sterling's girlfriend V. Stiviano wore a visor hat with a gang of supporters with hats emblazoned with her name
