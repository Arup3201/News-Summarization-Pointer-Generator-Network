Just hours earlier his former wife Nigella Lawson had described him as a ‘brutal’ man, whose ‘intimate terrorism’ drove her to cocaine.

But Charles Saatchi, 70, seemed keen to show the world he was still in high spirits – and enjoying the company of a much younger TV host.

The former advertising tycoon was pictured on Thursday night smiling and joking outside the exclusive 34 restaurant in Mayfair with his increasingly close friend Trinny Woodall, a journalist and former presenter of fashion programme What Not to Wear.

Share the joke: While Charles was on the phone, Trinny threw her head back in laughter

They joked while each smoking a 
cigarette, 49-year-old Miss Woodall throwing back her head and roaring 
with laughter. In a moment of closeness he gripped her arm to emphasise a
point.

It was outside another Mayfair restaurant, Scott’s, that Mr Saatchi gripped the throat of Miss Lawson, 53, in June.

Pictures
of the incident led to Miss Lawson leaving home, Mr Saatchi accepting a
caution for assault, and to their prompt divorce.

Details
of the bitter break-up are now being broadcast worldwide as part of the
trial of the former couple’s housekeepers Lisa and Francesca Grillo – 
who deny defrauding their wealthy employers of £685,000.

Nigella Lawson, 53, seen 
arriving at court on Thursday, said she snorted cocaine while married to
Charles Saatchi after being subjected to 'intimate terrorism'

Testimony: Nigella Lawson is questioned by Karina Arden, defending, as sisters Elisabetta and Francesca Grillo watch from the dock

Lawyers
for the Grillos claim Mr Saatchi and Miss Lawson are more interested in
sniping at each other than in the case against the sisters.

The
celebrity cook told jurors that  her ex-husband had grabbed her throat 
in a jealous rage after she had innocently spoken of looking forward to
having grandchildren.

She also accused her ex-husband of inflicting ‘a long summer of 
bullying and abuse’ on her after their high-profile divorce. She said it
had been the 'one of the longest years of my life'.

Giving her view on their domestic life, she told the jury how her 
ex-husband had such careful attention to detail he would order small 
marks to be removed from walls.

Lean on me: Charles Saatchi and Trinny Woodall were seen getting rather close outside 34 restaurant on Thursday evening

Togetherness: Trinny looked at Charles as he took a drag on his after-dinner cigarette

She also said Mr Saatchi only allowed her 
to have a dinner party at their Belgravia home once every two years.

She challenged her former husband’s allegations that she was ‘addled 
with drugs’ and ‘off her head’ on cocaine during the ten years they were
married.

Last week, the court heard from Mr Saatchi that he just wanted Ms Lawson to be happy.

He said: 'I adore Nigella now. I absolutely adore Nigella and I'm broken-hearted to have lost her. I wanted her to be happy.'

Hours after Ms Lawson had given evidence, a relaxed Saatchi was 
seen gazing at the former What Not To Wear presenter, wearing his usual 
suit and white shirt, left open at the neck.

Festive setting: The pair looked close as Charles lit up a cigarette on the steps

Laugh a lot: Charles and Trinny appeared to be enjoying their night out on Thursday evening

Match point: Trinny not only matched her coat to her scarf but also her tights and heels

Nice evening: The pair couldn't hide their smiles as they headed back to Trinny's car

Trinny, meanwhile, wrapped up against
the cold wearing a grey coat with large fluffy scarf  that was 
coordinated with her grey tights and heels.

Eating out at 34 marks a change for the couple, who are rarely seen anywhere other than Scott’s.

However the pair didn’t seem concerned about keeping a low profile and instead opted to stand closely in plain view of everyone.

Nigella
and Mr Saatchi separated after pictures emerged of him appearing to 
throttle his wife outside Scott's restaurant in Mayfair, central London,
in June.

Mr Saatchi and 
Trinny were spotted enjoying their first date together not long after 
his divorce from Nigella was finalised in July and have been spotted together regularly since.

Date night: Trinny and Saatchi are regularly seen dining out together, usually at Scott's

Home time: Charles jumped into the car ready for Trinny to drive home
