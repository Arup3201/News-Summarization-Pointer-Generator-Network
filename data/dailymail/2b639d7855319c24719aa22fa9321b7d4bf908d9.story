A biological 'switch' that turns on fat busting genes has been discovered - and it is trigger by exercise

A biological ‘switch’ that turns on fat busting genes has been discovered.

The finding offers hope of new drugs for slimmers, diabetics and people who suffer from heart disease.

The switch is triggered naturally by exercise and scientists believe it could be harnessed to help treat a range of illnesses.

Experiments on laboratory mice found they shed weight when the metabolite known as BAIBA (beta-aminoisobutyric acid) was activated.

The importance of physical activity in improving health and life expectancy has been long known, but the changes that occur during exercise are less clear.

Now, new research published in the journal Cell Metabolism has shown the molecule responsible for these beneficial effects.

Dr Robert Gerszten, of Massachusetts General Hospital, said: ‘Our finding bolsters the underlying notion that signals generated in one organ, such as exercising muscle, are released into the circulation and influence other tissues such as fat cells and liver.’

Earlier studies have demonstrated a protein regulates metabolic genes in muscle and contributes to their response to exercise.

Now, lab experiments show the protein produces a metabolite called BAIBA (beta-aminoisobutyric acid) and increases fat cells' expression of genes that burn calories.

In tests, it also made mice slimmer and helped balance their blood sugar.

Analysis done in human exercise and heart studies revealed BAIBA levels rise during exercise and reduce the risk of diabetes and other metabolic disorders.

The discovery could lead to the development of drugs for slimmers, diabetics and people with heart disease

The higher the level, the more they decrease blood sugar, insulin and harmful fats including cholesterol. In addition, there was a trend toward lower BMI.

The researchers said their findings suggest BAIBA may contribute to exercise induced protection from metabolic diseases.

Dr Gerszten added: ‘Manipulating BAIBA, or the enzymes that generate it, may have therapeutic potential. Burning fat is likely to impact multiple aspects of metabolic health related to diabetes, heart disease and other conditions.’
