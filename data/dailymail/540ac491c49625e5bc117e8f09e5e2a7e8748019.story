A mom who 'burned from the inside out' following an allergic reaction to her friend's medication has finally been reunited with her baby after spending a month apart as she battled to survive.

Yaasmeen Castanada, 19, suffered a life-threatening allergic reaction called Stevens-Johnson Syndrome after taking antibiotics on Thanksgiving Day because she was feeling sick.

Less than 24 hours later, she was hospitalized and on a ventilator with her body breaking out in massive blisters as if she had been burned from head to toe.

Yaasmeen suffered a life-threatening allergic reaction called Stevens-Johnson Syndrome after taking antibiotics on Thanksgiving Day because she was feeling sick

Today a photo was posted on a page updating her followers about her progress.

It showed Yaasmeen reaching out to touch her five-month-old girl from her hospital bed.

The caption read: 'Yaasmeen was able to touch her daughter Khloe. 

'She hadn't seen, touched, or talked to her since thanksgiving. What a precious gift to receive on Christmas.'

Traumatic: She suffered burning in her throat, eyes and mouth. Her eyes became bloodshot and her lips were tearing off

Diagnosis: When she was rushed to the ER, she was told that she had a rare but very serious allergic reaction to antibiotics called Stevens-Johnson syndrome that causes you to blister

Unwell: Yaasmeen was feeling a little under the weather and so took her friend's antibiotics

This week her breathing tube was removed and she was able to talk to Chloe.

'She called her name out,' her mother, Laura Corona, told ABC News.

'She told her she loved her.'

'She's walking now,' Corona said. 

'She just wants to hurry out and get better so she can get home to her baby.' 

Yaasmeen took the medication believing it would make her better, completely unaware it would be toxic to her body.

But she suffered burning in her throat, eyes and mouth.

Her eyes became bloodshot and her lips were tearing off. 

'It can be considered a burn from the inside out because of mucosal involvement,' said dermatologist Dr. Lawrence Matt. 

'First of all, don't share medication, don't give someone else your medication, don't offer medication,' she said. 'Another thing also, go get yourself checked out and your kids checked out, because you don't know what you're allergic to.'

Tough times: She will need physical, occupational, optical, dermatology, nutrition and burn therapy

Reaching out: Her family has set up a gofundme page to help pay for her medical bills and give updates on her status

Her body is now 70 percent damaged, and she needed a blood transfusion. 

She will need physical, occupational, optical, dermatology, nutrition and burn therapy.
