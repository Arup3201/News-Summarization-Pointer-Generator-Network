It's the biggest and most exciting day in the shopping calendar for the nation’s high street.

But it appears customers looking for the best bargains in department stores could have saved even more yesterday if they had stayed at home and shopped online.

Items including wide-screen TVs, microwaves and luxury beauty products were up to 20 per cent cheaper on Amazon than in department store sales.

The best bargains were to be had online where shoppers saved up to 20 per cent on items

And even shops offering up to 50per cent off luxury products were no match for the deals offered by the online retailer.

A half-price HoMedics Shiatsu Massage Cushion from Argos, reduced from £199.99 to £99.99, was listed on Amazon at £71.99.

House of Fraser was offering a Morphy Richards Jet Steam iron at half-price – £100 down from the original £200.

However on Amazon shoppers could buy the iron for £74.99, making a further saving of £25.01.

A Delonghi Nespresso Lattissima Plus coffee maker was reduced by just £26 to £233.99 at House of Fraser.

But customers could buy the same item from Amazon at £189.99, making a larger saving of £44.And a Panasonic microwave reduced from £189.99 to £169.99 at House of Fraser was a further £40 cheaper on Amazon at £129.99.

A 28” Samsung LED TV bought at Selfridges yesterday cost £249.99 but the same item was on Amazon for just £209.99 – £40 cheaper.

Separately, most high street stores are obliged to offer sale items at the same value both in-store and on their websites. However, special offers are often made available to online shoppers.

Amazon has been wooing customers away from the high street in recent years.

A cut-price Eastpak travel bag was £21.92 cheaper on Amazon than in the Selfridges sale, where it was reduced to £77.

And
 a high end Sisley slimming anti-cellulite cream was £10.90 cheaper on 
Amazon than in the House of Fraser sale, where it was reduced from £123 
to £110.70.

While Amazon 
has amassed £7billion in UK sales in the past three years, figures show 
that the high street retailers are suffering as a result.

Despite the buzz around the sales, London’s shopping district suffered a 9  per cent fall in footfall last week compared to the week leading up to Christmas last year. 

Figures from the New West End Company, which represent 600 retailers across Bond Street, Oxford Street and Regent Street showed visits to the area over the first three weeks of December reached 19.5 million – down 6.2 per cent on last year.

UK consumers are said to spend a total of 45 million hours shopping online between Christmas Eve and Boxing Day.

Thousands queued overnight at luxury stores though online offers were just as good, if not better
