A lesbian athletic director fired a popular male gym teacher who was married with kids because she disapproved of his traditional family status, he has claimed.

Gregory Kenney, 51, taught gym at Trinity School, an exclusive private school in Manhattan's Upper West Side, for 16 years before he was sacked in 2012.

The father-of-three claims in a lawsuit that the athletic director, Pat Krieger, took a disliking to him for being straight when she arrived in 2009 and treated the young, single women employees far better.

Krieger allegedly made Kenney coach three sports, even though his contract required him to coach two, and when he complained about it, she was unsympathetic, according to his suit.

After Kenney told Krieger that he couldn't working extra, she reported him to the headmaster but when a young, single female teacher had the same complaints, she accommodated her, the suit said.

He claims she 'routinely favored other single, younger females without children and discriminated against [him] because of his gender, sexual orientation, "traditional family status" and age'.

'I love the school. I love my job. I enjoyed the kids I was with and the classes I taught, but I have a wife and family. I'm not 16,' Kenney told the New York Daily News.

'He felt ostracized because of his family,' Kenney's attorney, Steven Morelli, told The New York Post.

Kenney, who coached soccer, basketball and golf at Trinity, added that on at least one occasion he was dissuaded from going to school events 'because he was a heterosexual, married male with children, who wouldn't fit in with [Krieger's] "culture",' the Post reported.

Then he claimed Krieger's attack became even more personal when she accused him of illegally subletting his Trinity Tower apartment and leaving students unsupervised, the suit says.

He claims that her accusations were false.

'It was very stressful and difficult,' Kenney told the Daily News.

He was fired as a result and said that three other married coaches with children also lost their jobs.

Kenney and his wife, who is also a gym teacher, complained to school officials about his treatment but nothing was done, he said.

After losing the job, Kenney, who has seven-year-old twin girls and a nine-year-old son, was replaced by a lesbian teacher, according to court papers.

He is seeking unspecified damages in the suit.

A spokesman for Trinity did not immediately comment.

The school, which was founded 300 years ago and costs parents as much as $41,000 a year per student, counts Truman Capote, Ivanka Trump and John McEnroe among its alumni.
