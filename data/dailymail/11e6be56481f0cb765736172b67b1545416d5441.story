A tourist visiting Norway to witness tomorrow's total eclipse of the sun was mauled by a polar bear as he slept.

Jakub Moravec, 37, had travelled from his home in the Czech Republic to enjoy the natural phenomenon in the scenic surroundings.

But he was lucky to escape with relatively minor injuries to his  arm, chest and face after the bear broke into his tent and attacked him.

Scars: Mr Moravec suffered a number of cuts to his arms, chest, shoulders and face following the attack

The remains of a polar bear, which attacked Mr Moravec on Spitsbergen island after travelling to watch tomorrow's solar eclipse 

Speaking from his hospital bed, Mr Moravec said: 'We were sleeping in the tent, and when I woke up the polar bear was standing on top of me.

'It went straight to my head. Luckily my colleague shot it.'

Moravec said he felt 'happy and fine' and that he only felt scared afterwards. During the attack, he said his thoughts were only 'to save my head'. 

Zuzanna Hakova, who was part of the same Czech tour party, said that her mother had shot the bear three times using a revolver.

She said: 'We woke to shouts of 'Bear! Bear!' coming from the second tent. 

'We had a rifle on the outside of each tent and we also had a revolver in our tent. 

'The ones being attacked had no chance of getting their weapon, so my mother took her revolver and shot at the bear three times.'

Moravec was one of a group of six campers who had travelled to the Svalbard islands in Norway's Arctic to enjoy the eclipse.

Attack: The polar bear attacked the tents were the six campers were sleeping, before being shot dead by authorities

Camp: The remote Svalbard islands are one of only two places on land where the eclipse will be fully visible

He is now being treated in Longyearbyen, the islands' capital, for injuries to his face and arm.

Police spokesman Vidar Arnesen said the group were on a combined ski and snow scooter trip on the remote islands more than 500 miles north of the Norwegian mainland.

Norwegian media had reported that there are many seals in the area, a food source that attracts the bears.

The Svalbard islands are one of only two places on land where the eclipse will be fully visible, along with the Faroe Islands.

The moon is expected to pass between Earth and the sun on Friday, with a total eclipse beginning at 10.11am GMT in Svalbard and lasting for three minutes.

Approximately 2,000 tourists from around the world are expected to descend on Svalbard for the chance to observe it.

Local authorities have repeatedly warned eclipse chasers of the region's dangerous polar bears. 

People leaving Svalbard's inhabited areas are required to be accompanied by an armed local guide or carry a rifle.

An estimated total of 3,000 polar bears live in the region, far outnumbering the 2,500 inhabitants.

There have been five fatal polar bear attacks in Svalbard in the past four decades. 

The most recent attack occurred in 2011, when 17-year-old British student Horatio Chapple was killed whilst on a school trip.
