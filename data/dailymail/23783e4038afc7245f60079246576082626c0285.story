Police have rounded up 18 operators of a prostitution ring being run in New York City because they were selling 'party packs' of cocaine and sex to high-end clients ahead of the Super Bowl.

Surveillance shows the ring laundered money and credit cards through clothing, wig, beauty supply and limousine businesses and targeted wealthy out-of-town customers, especially during large events.

Prostitutes would bring cocaine to clients who ordered the so-called party packs.

Naming names: Attorney General Eric Schneiderman showed the credit card and a poster with pictures of the prostitutes who took part in the 'party pack' deals where they sold and delivered both sex and drugs

Leaving a trail: The operators of the ring sent texts to frequent clients

The text sent 10 days before the Super Bowl says 'new sexy & beautiful girls R in town waiting for u'.

Officials say the arrests follow an 11-month investigation by state and city authorities- including undercover police officers- and was spearheaded by Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's Organized Crime Task Force. 

'These criminals utilized apartments in residential buildings as a way of carrying out their illicit activities,' police commissioner Bill Bratton said in a statement released by the Attorney General's office.

'They disregarded the safety and well-being of every member in those communities by providing a ‘one-stop shopping’ drug and prostitution ring.'

Names and faces: Aside from two men at the center of the scandal, most of the others involved were women

The 18 people that were arrested are now facing various charges, including money laundering, promoting prostitution, narcotics sales, and conspiracy.

The organizers would charge the 'johns' by covering their tracks and charging them through front businesses like a wig wholesaler and limousine service.

They would charge the men on their credit cards, and sometimes the drugs were billed in an equivalent number of 'hours' of prostitution services.

The raids took place late Wednesday and early Thursday and the ring operators were brought in and processed at the 7th precinct in Manhattan's Lower East Side.

The New York Daily News reports that some of the operators took advantage of the 'johns' willingness to meet with the prostitutes by sending multiple women to each client at each time.

That trick landed a number of the men with billings for single sessions that cost upwards of $10,000.

Aside from the texts to known clients, the operators also allegedly used commercials on public access television and internet ads to appeal to out-of-towners.

'Drug trafficking and prostitution are a 
scourge on communities across our state,' Attorney General Schneiderman 
said in a statement.

Center of it all: A number of busts have been made throughout the city, including one Wednesday night that took place just blocks from the area in Times Square that is being called Super Bowl Boulevard

Arrested: A second prostitution bust came Wednesday night as police arrested four alleged prostitutes and one man just blocks from Super Bowl Boulevard

'My office will continue to work with our partners in law enforcement on multi-agency investigations like this one to take down networks of criminals who exploit women and poison our communities for profit.'

This ring is just one of many prostitution busts that have taken place in New York ahead of the big football game, as The New York Times reports that 298-prostitution arrests were reported from the first of this month through the 16th. That marks a 30 per cent increase from that same time period last year.

One such bust took place, according to ABC 7, at an apartment building on 6th Avenue and 37th Street- very close to
 the area designated 'Super Bowl Boulevard'- served as one of the bases 
of operations.

Five people were arrested in the building, four of whom allegedly appeared to be prostitutes.
