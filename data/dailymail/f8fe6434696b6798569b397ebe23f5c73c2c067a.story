Gennaro Gattuso wants to be the next manager at League One Oldham Athletic

Gattuso, who played 73 times for his country and lifted the World Cup in 2006, is currently unattached after spells in charge of FC Sion, Palermo and OFI Crete.

He made his name as a tough tackling midfielder at Rangers before he returned to Italy with Salernitana in 1998.

Gattuso, who also applied for the Hamilton Academical job in January, would go on to make more than 300 appearances for AC Milan during a 13-year stint at the San Siro.

Oldham remain without a manager after Lee Johnson jumped ship to join League One rivals Barnsley in February.

Gattuso enjoyed hugely-successful 13-year spell with Milan, where he won two Champions League titles

Johnson is set to face a hostile reception when he returns to Boundary Park with his new club on Saturday.

Oldham spoke to Paul Scholes about the likelihood of taking over from Johnson but the Manchester United legend, who lives in the town, decided that the timing was not right.

Others to be linked with the job include ex-West Bromwich Albion manager Alan Irvine, former Manchester City coaches Scott Sellars and Steve Eyre and Iain Dowie, who managed the club from 2002 to 2003.
