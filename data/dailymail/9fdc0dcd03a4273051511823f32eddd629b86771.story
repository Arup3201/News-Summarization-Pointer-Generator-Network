The TV adverts would have you  believe that meerkats keep warm with a stylish combination of silk cravat and crushed-velvet dressing gown.

But in real life, the mammals can go to acrobatic extremes to escape the  cold – especially when, like these three, they are facing winter in a British zoo rather than in their native Kalahari.

The pictures show one of the intrepid creatures displaying the dexterity of a circus trapeze artist to scramble into position beneath a heat lamp. And once there, he makes himself at home, exposing his belly to its comforting rays.

Brr! It's a bit cool for Kats. The wily creature looks at the heat lamp and an idea forms

Meerkats have a patch on their tummy which is only sparsely covered in hair, exposing the black skin beneath which acts like a solar panel, absorbing the heat after a cold desert night.

Simples, as Compare the Market’s elegantly dressed mascot Alexsandr Orlov would surely say.

This trio was captured in action by photographer Nick Povey on a trip to Paradise Wildlife Park at Broxbourne, Hertfordshire.

Oof! It's not as simples as it looks

Compared with you meerkats, I'm baking. The creature enjoys the heat from his new perch
