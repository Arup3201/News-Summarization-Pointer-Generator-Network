Thousands of women trying for a baby through IVF are being given unnecessary and expensive procedures to examine the womb, warn doctors.

Research shows that having a hysteroscopy to check the womb before fertility treatment makes no difference to success rates.

But some private clinics insist on the invasive procedure, which costs up to £3,000 a time, before giving IVF.

Dr Tarek El-Toukhy, from Guy’s and St Thomas’s Hospital, London, who led the study, said: ‘Based on these findings, outpatient hysteroscopy before IVF doesn’t significantly improve IVF results and cannot be considered essential for women with recurrent IVF failure.’

Thousands of women trying for a baby through IVF are being given unnecessary and expensive procedures to examine the womb,  doctors have warned

There has been a long-running debate over whether to perform hysteroscopies on women who have failed to get pregnant after one or more IVF attempts.

The procedure – often under general anaesthetic – uses a narrow tube with a camera at the end to send images to a computer, where they can be checked for problems such as scar tissue that may cause infertility.

If any abnormal growths are detected they are subsequently removed using a repeat procedure.

In a trial involving eight fertility centres in Europe, 700 women who had suffered an unsuccessful round of IVF treatment were randomly assigned either a hysteroscopy before a second attempt, or put straight through for IVF again.

Abnormalities of the womb were found in one in 10 women having the procedure.

But using the procedure and treating such problems made no significant difference to a woman’s chances of going on to have a baby, the researchers found.

The take-home baby rate was 31 per cent in the hysteroscopy group and 29 per cent in women who had IVF alone.

Dr El-Toukhy said the finding suggested the abnormalities discovered had ‘little clinical significance’ and were not interfering with the woman’s chances of getting pregnant.

Dr El-Toukhy said hysteroscopy was justified in women where an abnormality in the womb was found by ultrasound, but not as a routine procedure prior to IVF.

The findings were reported yesterday at the annual meeting of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) in Munich.

Dr Yacoub Khalaf, a fertility expert from King’s College London, said: ‘In some clinics, the first thing they do is hysteroscopy before the patients get any IVF.

‘It’s standard in some clinics and could cost £2,000 to £3,000 under general anaesthetic. It’s an unpleasant experience and this study shows it does not add value.’

Using non-invasive ultrasound for most women would show if they needed treatment of polyps, or growths, in the womb, he added.

Professor Allan Pacey, chairman of the British Fertility Society, said hysteroscopy was often routinely used even in NHS fertility clinics, costing around £500-£600 a time.

The money could be better spent on giving women more IVF treatment, he added.
