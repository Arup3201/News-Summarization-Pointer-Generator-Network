Earlier this year globally acclaimed artist Guo Jian was exiled from China.

His arrest came after police forced the 42-year-old to destroy his most iconic work, an apocalyptic diorama of Tiananmen Square which he slathered with ground pork meat.

Jian, Chinese born but a naturalised Australian, returned to Sydney in June after being detained for two weeks in Beijing, and he is now working on his first post-exile exhibition in New York.

Recalling the night of his arrest, the artist said he feared for his life when a mob of 20 police arrived at his studio in eastern Beijing to question him over the artwork.

'I was terrified. It was the middle of the night and nobody else was there; I thought they were going to make me disappear,' he said.

'They forced me to smash the sculpture with a hammer and filmed me doing it. There was at least 20 of them, so I could hardly say no.'

Jian says 'The Square' represents the rapid urbanisation of China, a process which frequently sees cultural landmarks demolished.

'I wanted to show that nothing was safe if we continue down this road, not even the strongest symbols of Chinese culture. The meat was a  sign that  everything will go rotten' he said.

But he says the Chinese government did not take kindly to his interpretation of the Beijing landmark.

Jian is adamant that it was the international coverage of 'The Square' that sparked his exile from China, while the Chinese government claims it was due to 'visa irregularities'

Tiananmen Square was the site of a notorious massacre Jian himself witnessed in 1989, which saw the Chinese military open fire on thousands of pro-democracy protesters, killing an undisclosed number.

Jian's arrest came days before the 25th anniversary of the event, a time when the Chinese government was arresting scores of activists and artists in what could be viewed as a crackdown on dissent.

A spokeswoman for the Department of Foreign Affairs told The Australian Jian had been deported, 'reportedly due to visa irregularities'.

But Jian is adamant his visa was legitimate, and instead insisted that it was the international coverage of the artwork by news services such as the New York Times and the BBC that sparked the ordeal.

'I think 'The Square' was the last straw. Even though it never left my studio, the Government had been watching me for a long time, even in Australia,' he said. 

'When the artwork gained exposure they decided to draw the line.'

Jian says he has no regrets about the artwork, despite being separated from his family over the ordeal

Jian says he has been blacklisted by the government and would be harshly monitored by government officials if he ever returns

When he arrived at prison, Jian says he was interrogated for five hours before being taken into a squalid cell.

'There was one toilet between fifteen men, and the bedding they gave me probably hadn't been washed in years,' he said.

But he says the worst of the experience was psychological.

'The worst of it was the mind games. They threaten you and film you all the time to make you paranoid. They never beat me, but they did (beat) some inmates.'

Jian spent his two weeks in jail speaking to other prisoners and learning their stories. When the short sentence was up, he was whisked to the airport and told he could not  return for at least five years.

'At first I was annoyed  because they lied until the last minute. I have been dislodged from my family. But when I look at what is going on with the Chinese government cracking down on artists and activists, I feel like it would be too dangerous for me to return now.'

Jian says he has been blacklisted and would be harshly monitored by government officials if he ever returned.

However he told ABC he has no regrets about making 'The Square.'

'This make me feel more strong and it gives me the strength to do my art, and also I feel that I should keep going, to make people to know I'm still standing, even after these things happen to me, nothing can really knock me down.'

Jian says the experience gave him the strength to continue his art and show people 'nothing can knock me down'

Instead, Jian is now working on his first post exile exhibition, a multidimensional project titled #SURRENDER.  

Jian says the message is 'a grassroots cry for non-violence. We are living in an era of immense violence,' he said.

'Between ISIS, Ukraine and Gaza, there is a real militarism resurgence. I feel we need an anti-militant resistance.' 

The multimedia exhibition features a war memorial and a documentary about its creation.

The exhibition is set to open in early February 2015, and continue through  March.
