Sunderland have held further talks with Liverpool over their proposed £10million deal for Fabio Borini.

Liverpool want £12m for the Italian and, as reported by Sportsmail last month, Sunderland have discussed an offer of £8m plus £2m in add ons.

They are trying to find a compromise agreement over the structure of the deal with the player keen to join and get regular football.

Meanwhile, Sunderland have held talks over a £3m move for USA international defender Matt Besler but are unlikely to pursue a deal with Cagliari's Davide Astori an alternative.

Fulham have also had an offer rejected for Besler, the 27-year-old Sporting Kansas City centre-half, who said: 'I know that Fulham has offered to Kansas City and I know that Sunderland put in an offer or are putting in an offer.

'We’re trying to get something done as soon as possible. It’s a situation which needs to get resolved.'

Sunderland are selling midfielder Alfred N'Diaye to Real Betis.
