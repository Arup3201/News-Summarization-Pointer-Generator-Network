Jordon Mutch has completed his £5.75million switch from QPR to Crystal Palace. 

The former Cardiff City midfielder has signed a four-and-a-half year deal with Alan Pardew's side 

The 23-year-old has failed to make an impact at Rangers since his move in the summer and was freed to leave by manager Harry Redknapp.

The Eagles have agreed a £4.75m fee rising to £5.75m with add-ons.

Palace are also close to completing a deal for free agent Shola Ameobi after the striker agreed to join the south London club after leaving Turkish side Gaziantep in December.

Ameobi held talks with Palace on Tuesday as Pardew looks to reunite himself with the experienced centre-forward.

Palace have allowed midfielder Stuart O'Keefe to join Cardiff.
