Ed Balls is preparing to hammer the owners of expensive homes to pay for an increase in spending on the NHS, it emerged yesterday.

The Shadow Chancellor told the Labour conference in Manchester that his party would impose a mansion tax on houses worth more than £2million.

He said the £2 billion raised each year would be used to help ‘safeguard our vital public services’. Indicating that the NHS would be the chief beneficiary, he said Labour would do ‘whatever it takes’ to preserve the health service.

Ed Balls told the Labour conference his party would impose a mansion tax on houses worth over £2million

Mr Balls used his speech to attempt to rehabilitate Labour’s battered economic credibility by apologising for a string of mistakes in government and ruling out higher borrowing if it won power again.

He also confirmed that Labour would scrap the Coalition’s marriage tax break – money which would be used to pay for the restoration of the 10p tax rate.

But the speech was met with silence from delegates. And there was some booing when he said the retirement age would have to rise in future years.

Mr Balls confirmed Labour would introduce the plan, originally floated by the Liberal Democrats, to levy a tax on the ‘highest-value properties – a mansion tax on houses worth over £2 million’.

The speech was met with silence from delegates and there wasbooing when he said retirement age would rise

‘We will do it in a fair, sensible and proportionate way; raising the limit each year in line with average rises in house prices,’ he said. ‘How can it be right that the billionaire overseas buyer this year of a £140 million penthouse in Westminster will pay just £26 a week in property tax – the same as the average-value property in that area?’

Labour would not say how much the mansion tax would raise. The Lib Dems have estimated it would raise £1.7 billion a year, but Labour’s higher bands for homes worth tens of millions could raise more.

Mr Balls warned of fresh welfare cuts, including keeping the cap on child benefit for another two years.

‘We will have to make other decisions which I know will not be popular with everyone,’ he said, highlighting plans to raise the state retirement age and scrap the winter fuel allowance.

Labour leader Ed Miliband is expected to focus on the NHS in his conference speech today, and Mr Balls appeared to hint that more funding could be found to shore up services.

Mr Balls warned of fresh welfare cuts, including keeping the cap on child benefit for another two years

‘Next year, after just five years of David Cameron – with waiting times rising, fewer nurses and a crisis in A&E – we will have to save the NHS from the Tories once again,’ he said. ‘And we will do what it takes.’

In an attempt to shore up his party’s economic credentials, Mr Balls said the party had to show it had ‘learned’ and was ready to be ‘honest with the country about what the last Labour government got right and what we got wrong’.

Among the errors he listed were the lifting of transitional controls on migration from new EU states in 2004, and not regulating banks strongly enough before the credit crunch – although he stopped short of saying Labour had overspent before the financial crisis.

‘The truth is we should have regulated those banks in a tougher way,’ he said.

‘It was a mistake. We should apologise for it. And I do.’

He said the Labour government had also failed to tackle the ‘underlying causes of rising spending on housing benefit and in-work poverty’, and should not have abolished the 10p tax rate.

The Conservatives said Mr Balls’s speech committed Labour to an extra £20.4 billion of spending. Business minister Matthew Hancock said: ‘Labour haven’t learned their lesson. They would burden our children with more debt than our children could ever hope to repay.’

It was more about posturing than policy

Home Affairs Editor James Slack looks at Ed Balls’s promises, and concludes they were more about show than reality:

Ed Balls attended a Sure Start Centre in Manchester after announcing Labour would keep the child benefit cap

Incoming Labour ministers will take a 5 per cent pay cut

A populist gesture which will not make so much as a ripple in the ocean of public debt. The current government cut ministerial salaries by 5 per cent in 2010 and then froze them at that level for the duration of the Parliament, saving £3 million. Mr Balls’s announcement amounts to a deficit cut of 0.003 per cent.

Save £400 million by capping rises in child benefit at 1 per cent

This real terms cut – inflation is currently 2 per cent – will raise very little. The Coalition has put the policy in place until 2016. Labour would simply extend it by another year. Treasury sources say the additional savings made by Mr Balls would be just £120 million.

Raise minimum wage from £6.31 to £8 by the end of the next Parliament

Labour claims that applying the policy to the public sector would not cost any money, since the State would save in benefit payments currently made to top-up the income of the low-paid. However, business leaders warn the policy will be hugely expensive and lead to firms employing fewer workers.

Reverse the Government’s ‘£3 billion tax cut’ for highest-rate taxpayers

Political positioning, designed to fuel the politics of envy, which might even cost the Exchequer money if top-earners respond by leaving the country, or find new ways of avoiding tax. A study for HMRC found that George Osborne’s decision to cut the 50p rate to 45p reduced tax revenues by only £100 million. Reimposing the 50p rate would raise a similar amount at best – and nothing like £3 billion.

Scrap the married couples tax break

More political posturing. The tax allowance is David Cameron’s flagship policy for recognising the importance of strong families, but Labours claim it amounts to social engineering. Over the course of the next Parliament, scrapping it will save £3 billion. The money will be spent on a new 10p tax rate for the lowest paid, not paying down the deficit.

Axe winter fuel payments for the better-off

This would affect 600,000 people over 61 and will save only £100 million. It is worth recalling that Labour introduced the payments in the first place.

Balance the books

Mr Balls’s boldest claim, but experts say that, if Labour is elected, Britain will borrow significantly more. On paying down the debt, Mr Balls’s timeframe is only ‘as soon as possible’. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said Labour’s plans would allow Mr Balls to spend £28 billion more than the Chancellor over the course of the next parliament, all of it borrowed.

Increase corporation tax and impose a new financial transactions tax

Analysis by the Centre for Policy Studies warns that, overall, the tax changes planned by Labour will do great harm – costing the UK 300,000 jobs and more than £25 billion in GDP by damaging confidence and reducing investment. A spokesman said: ‘The consequences for GDP and employment will be negative.’

A scene from the hit 1965 film The Sound of Music, which Ed Balls admitted makes him 'cry every time'

From the rough and tumble of the Commons to illegal tackles on the football pitch, Ed Balls has a reputation as a bit of a bruiser.

It turns out, however, that he also has a soft side – admitting that he cries every time he watches The Sound of Music.

The Shadow Chancellor spoke yesterday of his love for the 1965 musical about a nun called Maria who becomes a governess to the seven children of Captain von Trapp, an Austrian widower.

An audience at the Labour Party conference laughed as he gave an account of his family holiday with wife Yvette Cooper, the Shadow Home Secretary, and their three children on a Sound of Music tour in Salzburg. The family made their own clothes out of curtains and ran through meadows, singing songs from the film.

Mr Balls said: ‘It was a three-hour trip where we each had a bike with a basket like Maria, and a beatbox with all the songs and you go on a guided tour playing the music. You run through a meadow.

‘And then Yvette said if we do it we must make clothes out of curtains, so we bought some curtain material and on the train to Salzburg we sat there sewing lederhosen for the teenage lads. The girls and women had head scarves.’

Asked if the movie made him cry, he said: ‘Every time. In the end, he marries Maria and they dodge the Nazis, and every time you watch it you never know if they are going to make it.’
