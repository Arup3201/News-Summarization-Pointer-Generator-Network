An Oklahoma woman accused of shooting dead her fiance whom she suspected of being unfaithful has been ordered to stand trial on a first-degree murder charge.

Sandra Woodard has been charged in the killing of Harley Moody, 37, an Navy veteran and local radio host who was found mortally wounded in the their Lone Wolf, Oklahoma, home in early January.

When interviewed by police after Moody's death, Woodard told officers that she accidentally shot her husband-to-be during a sexual role-playing game.

Her version: Woodard, pictured in jail garb on her way to a preliminary hearing, told police she shot Moody by accident during a sex game

But an investigation has uncovered gaping holes in Woodard's story, leading to her arrest nine days later.

On Monday, Woodard dressed in orange-and-white jail garb appeared in court for her preliminary hearing.

The prosecution called 10 witnesses to testify, among them several family members of the victim who all said that Woodard did not trust Moody and suspected him of infidelity, the station KSWO reported.

Moody's sister-in-law Sherry Moody said from the stand that she and Woodard grew close, and the woman confided in her that she had created a fake Craigslist account hoping to catch her fiancé red-handed.

Several months before the killing, Mrs Moody recalled how Woodard was leaving her house when she turned around and said: 'A friend of mine said that I should shoot him.' 

Sherry warned her that she should never speak like that, but Woodard allegedly doubled down, adding, 'I might just go kill him and plead the fifth.'

Radio personality: Moody, a father of six, worked as a DJ for KEYB Radio in Altus, Oklahoma

Concerned for her brother-in-law's safety, Sherry Moody called her mother and then the 37-year-old DJ, asking him if his fiancee had means to harm him.

The man replied that his wife-to-be owned a gun. Afterwards, the father of six took his children and went to stay with his parents in Olustee.

Sherry Moody testified that on another occasion, Woodard called her saying that she believed she had seen her fiance in a pornographic video on an X-rated website.

Woodard asked her friend to take a look at the video to see if she recognized Harley Moody, but the sister-in-law refused to do it.

Early signs of trouble: Months before the killing, Woodard allegedly told Moody's relative that a friend told her she should shoot him, and she added that she might kill him and 'plead the fifth'

On Monday, the court also heard from the victim’s supervisor at KEYB Radio who testified that one time, Woodard came in asking to use her fiance's computer while he was not there.

The supervisor later discovered that Woodard used the computer to look for pornography because she was convinced that her fiance was an adult film star who employed software to obscure his face.

Military man: Moody joined the U.S. Navy after high school and served in Operation Desert Storm

Just after 11pm on January 7, Sandra Woodard called 911 to report that she had accidentally shot Harley Moody, according to Altus Times.

Officers who responded to the couple's home on East 1410 Road in Lone Wolf found the 37-year-old man bleeding heavily from multiple gunshot wounds inflicted with a semi-automatic pistol. The father of six was pronounced dead on the scene. 

Moody's obituary stated that the 37-year-old man joined the U.S. Navy after finishing high school and was a veteran of Operation Desert Storm. After leaving the military, he was hired by KEYB Radio in Atlus as a DJ.

His many hobbies included singing and playing guitar, riding his motorcycle and working on old cars. Moody is survived by three daughters and three sons.

Sandra Woodard was charged in the murder about a week after the killing. She is being held in jail on $1million bond pending her formal arraignment scheduled for June 4.
