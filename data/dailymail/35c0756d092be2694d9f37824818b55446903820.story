A married policeman has been sacked after meeting a man he met on a gay social media app for sex while on duty.

Father-of-two Pc Anthony Taylor was understood to have disabled his police radio so he would not be disturbed during the two hour long sex sessions.

The 30-year-old Greater Manchester Police officer twice met the man when he was wearing full uniform and should have been patrolling the streets.

Taylor, who had served with the force for 10 years, was dismissed after being found guilty of gross misconduct.

Taylor met the man for the first time in August after chatting to him via a phone app.

On the first occasion he went to the unnamed man's city centre flat after driving out of his division, where he was a member of the Neighbourhood Policing Team. 

The second time, he picked up the man from the five-star Lowry Hotel in Salford in a marked police car before driving to his flat.

On both occasions he was said to have been at the man's home for about two hours.

Greater Manchester Police launched an investigation after being alerted to the clandestine meetings.

Officers gained access to text messages between Taylor and the man, and found dozens of conversations about the sex sessions which included references to his uniform and handcuffs.

They also found images of the officer in his uniform.  

Taylor admitted to the man that he should have been on duty but used the false name of 'George Smith' when meeting and texting him.

A police spokesman confirmed that Taylor had been dismissed after being found guilty of gross misconduct.

He was dismissed on February 10, by Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy following a 90 minute Special Case Hearing held at the force's headquarters the week before.

Taylor had been in the force for 10 years and glowing references were given at the hearing.

Assistant Chief Constable Dawn Copley said: 'Pc Taylor's actions could have put the public in danger and put undue pressure on his colleagues.

'GMP and the public rightly expect a high standard of professional behaviour from both officers and employees.

'Taylor's conduct while on duty unfortunately fell well below that standard.'

One source said: 'The view was that he had grievously harmed the force with his actions.

'I understand the chief constable took the view that the public would have demanded his dismissal.

'It was a complete and utter abuse of his power and position.'
