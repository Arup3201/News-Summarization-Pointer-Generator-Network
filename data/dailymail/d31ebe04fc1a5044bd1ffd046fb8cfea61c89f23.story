What is your wildest desire? I have one of those dreams — the most exotic, unattainable yearning I can imagine.

But it isn’t winning the lottery, or something that would belong in the pages of 50 Shades Of Grey.

Rather, my ultimate outrageous daydream is . . . to have normal hair. Not marvellous hair. Not even Kim-Sears-meets-Cheryl-Cole hair. Just something that resembles the stuff regular people have on their head.

Beyond frizzy: Kate has always longed for normal hair that doesn't have to be tamed into submission

Other women wash their hair, leave it to dry, and do not look as if they have had an encounter with an electric storm. They can go swimming, then walk around as their hair dries into shiny, swingy shape. But not me.

Left to dry naturally, my hair is beyond frizzy. It is a trichological freak of nature I’ve been putting up with for 50 years.

My life is ruled by the tyranny of bludgeoning it into submission. Any scheduled hair wash must allow 30 to 40 minutes for blow-drying and straightening irons, if I am to achieve the height of my styling ambitions — to look like other women.

Even non-washing days require a minimum ten minutes to wrestle it into normality. But the tyranny doesn’t end there. Any form of damp weather, humidity or drizzle sees my newly-straightened hair return to a frizzy mass within 60 seconds.

Volumising treatment: Kate undergoes the new, British blow-dry which has been devised by London hairdresser Edward James to suit women with finer hair

I’ve often considered having a Brazilian blow-dry — a smoothing and straightening treatment in which the protein keratin is ironed into the hair — but it can cost up to £500 every three months, requires at least four hours in the salon, and is so full of formaldehyde that Jennifer Aniston was forced to slice her famous locks to chin-length after treatments ruined her hair.

Brazilian blow-dries can also leave hair lank, stripping hair like mine of its one redeeming quality — volume. But now, salvation has emerged. The new, British blow-dry has been devised by London hairdresser Edward James to suit those of us with finer hair.

The formula costs £100, takes 15 minutes to apply, contains no formaldehyde and promises specifically to preserve volume.

Rather than covering the whole head in straightening solution, as with a Brazilian treatment, it is painted only on to the frizziest parts (the ends), avoiding roots, except right at the crown.

What’s more, you don’t need to leave hair for several days after the treatment before washing it, as with the Brazilian version — 24 hours is all that’s required.

And, instead of avoiding any shampoo that contains sulphate afterwards (as you must with the Brazilian) any type is fine.

I couldn’t get to Edward’s salon in South-West London fast enough. ‘Your hair isn’t actually super frizzy,’ Edward claimed, as I settled into a chair. ‘The frizziest part is at the top of your crown, but that’s quite common.’

The treatment was preceded with an ammonia-free glossing oil to add shine and moisture. In ten minutes, it was worked from root to tip, then left for another ten, before being shampooed away. Now for Edward’s formula.

Confidence boost: The treatment leaves the hair feeling very conditioned and creates a smooth, shiny finish

‘I’m applying smoothing keratin protein, specifically where the hair is more unmanageable,’ he said, as he ran what looked like a tiny paintbrush through varying lengths of my hair.

‘Keratin is one of the key constituents of the hair shaft. This treatment is designed to strengthen and smooth the hair and make it feel more moisturised and manageable.’ It sounded like the usual blurb you hear about lots of hair products.

fifteen minutes later, Edward began blow-drying, and the difference was unmistakeable. It was the feel of my hair which, at this stage, was most noticeably different. It was unbelievably silky.

‘The treatment leaves the hair feeling very conditioned,’ said Edward. ‘It will not remove curl, but will create a smooth, shiny finish with body at the roots.

‘It is perfect for hair that reacts to humidity, and is suitable for most hair types. Some Brazilian blow-dries alter the shade of coloured hair, but the British blow-dry helps condition it.’

Four days later: Kate is delighted by the results of her British blow-dry and no longer needs straighteners

Just over an hour after entering the salon, I was done. Running my hands through my hair felt wonderfully unfamiliar, and the way it bounced as I walked was a huge confidence boost.

The first test was to drive the 30 miles home with my car roof down. Before, I always had to tie my hair back; otherwise, the buffeting snarled it into knots. This time, there was not one tangle; it simply fell back into place.

When I woke the next day, I ran to the mirror — and feared the spell had been broken when I saw my hair had gone flat either side of my head. But ten seconds with a brush saw the shape restored.

Later, I got caught in a downpour; usually a recipe for disaster. Not now. I ran my fingers through my hair and it was straight again.

Then, the next day, the ultimate test: I washed it, having set aside the usual 40 minutes to blow-dry it. But after 15 minutes, there was nothing left to do. I didn’t even need my straightening irons.

This is life-altering stuff. Now, a new affliction has set in: a manic compulsion to keep touching the silky softness atop my head. And if that provokes stares, I don’t care. I finally have great hair.
