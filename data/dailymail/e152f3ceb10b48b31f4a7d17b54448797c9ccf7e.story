Ordeal: Tracey and Andy Ferrie, who were held for 66 hours on suspicion of grievous bodily harm, said it was a 'living nightmare'

The couple held by police over the shooting of two intruders at their isolated  cottage spoke yesterday of their ‘living nightmare’.

Andy Ferrie said he ‘plumbed the depths of despair’ when police told him he could face a charge of attempted murder.

Tracey Ferrie said being kept in a police cell away from her husband had ‘petrified’ her and she was haunted by the ‘stomach-churning’ experience.

Mr Ferrie, 35, and his 43-year-old wife were arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm after he called police to report that he had discharged a shotgun, hitting two of four men who had broken into their home.

They were held in separate cells and handcuffed for a court appearance where detectives sought more time to hold them for questioning.

Mrs Ferrie, a saleswoman, said: ‘I was completely petrified. Being locked up in a police cell just yards from my husband, but banned from talking to him, was agony.

‘When I can get some sleep now I wake up with a start and think I’m back in the cell. It’s mortifying and stomach churning.’

She said their cottage at Welby,  near Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, looked like ‘something out of CSI’ as police swarmed around the hamlet following the incident early last Sunday.

Mr Ferrie, who runs a mobile home repair business, said being told he could ultimately face an attempted murder charge had left him too anxious to eat during almost three days and nights in custody.

The Ferries were eventually released on bail late on Tuesday evening. Crown lawyers lifted the threat of prosecution the following evening after concluding the couple ‘did what they believed was necessary to protect themselves and their home from intruders’.

Mr Ferrie fired at the men using a weapon held legally by his wife, a keen clay pigeon shooter. The intruders suffered non-life-threatening injuries and were arrested on suspicion of aggravated burglary – along with their alleged accomplices – at Leicester Royal Infirmary.

‘I was petrified, scared stiff,’ Mr Ferrie told The Sun. ‘I only did what any other bloke would have done given the situation. I’m no hero or hard man. I did what I did to protect my precious, lovely wife.

‘I was only a few feet away, I could have shot to kill but I didn’t. I was relieved later when I was told the injuries I had caused were not life-threatening. The events of the last few days have scarred us for life.’

Mr Ferrie, who plans to emigrate to Australia with his wife next year, said that during his time in custody he was ‘told my case had been upgraded to attempted murder’.

He added: ‘I just crumpled. I saw 
myself being sent to prison for a long, long time. I was offered food 
but didn’t eat for the whole 66 hours we were held.’

Last
week, a court heard how the couple were woken by the sound of banging 
and breaking glass as the intruders forced their way inside just after 
midnight. Mr Ferrie confronted one of the alleged raiders in their 
bedroom.

Inquiry: Mrs Ferrie said their cottage in Leicestershire 'looked like something out of CSI' as police investigated the shooting

His wife believes she was arrested after telling officers she had grabbed a crowbar and a torch as the incident unfolded.

Mr Ferrie said that when police informed them no further action was to be taken, it felt as if a ‘weight had been lifted from our heads that was slowly crushing us’.

Daniel Mansell, 33, from Leicester, admitted burglary at Loughborough Magistrates Court last week. He was remanded in custody for sentencing.

Joshua O’Gorman, 27, who is also charged with burglary, gave no indication of plea and was remanded in custody.

Two men aged 23 and 31 were arrested on suspicion of aggravated burglary and bailed pending further inquiries.

The Government is preparing legislation to clarify the rights of homeowners to defend property from intruders or burglars.
