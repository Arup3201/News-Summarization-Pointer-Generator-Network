The man was seized In Syria in February of 2013

A Syrian man who was held hostage by a group which was absorbed into ISIS in 2013 has shared the story of his five-month ordeal.

The anonymous man, who is Christian and works as a superintendent at a building outside of Beirut, Lebanon, was taken by a group called the Muhajadeen Shura Council in February of 2013.

He had passed through 15 Syrian Army checkpoints after entering the country from Lebanon when the militants took him and another man who was also Christian.

The men were handcuffed, put in a truck and driven to a location about eight hours away, the man told New York Magazine. 

Once they arrived, the men were blindfolded and chained to a wall. 

The militia members informed the second man they were going to kill him and told the first man something even more frightening.

They said: 'We know everything about you. We know where your family lives, what their names are.'

Members of the Muhajadeen Shura Council would torture the man by beating, electrocuting and starving him

The men were tortured, beaten and starved.

On one occasion, the man was forced to speak with his family on the phone while being electrocuted so they would hear him scream and feel more compelled to pay a ransom.

Another time, they told the man if his family didn't pay in two days, 'We will make you call your family and tell them it's their fault you are going to die.'

Later that day, group members took the second man into an adjacent room and shot him. 

A Christian man from Aleppo, Syria, was brought in and took his place. 

At some point the Muhajadeen Shura Council was absorbed by ISIS.

When ISIS took over, they removed the blindfolds on the hostages. 

The man's family  paid ISIS about $80,000 to get him out and he was released in Aleppo, Syria (pictured) 

The man said the soldiers serving his new captors were 'brainwashed' and they hailed from countries including France, Belgium, Germany, Russia, Britain, Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Tunisia.

The ISIS soldiers continued to torture the men both physically and mentally, but they did not try to convert them to Islam. 

The man's family eventually paid ISIS about $80,000 to get him out and he was released into the streets of Aleppo.

He estimated there were over 100 people being held during the course of his confinement, the majority of whom were Christian, and that 37 people were killed. 

The man said 'It is a hard life, being a hostage', and called his release 'The most wonderful feeling I've ever had'. 

ISIS held at least 23 foreign hostages in the same prison, including Americans Kayla Mueller and James Foley, the New York Times reported. 

Mueller and Foley are now dead, 

British journalist John Cantlie, who was seized at the same time as Foley, is still being held.
