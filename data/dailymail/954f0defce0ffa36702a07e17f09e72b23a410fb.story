She is among 22 people announced by Prime Minister David Cameron in August to have received a Conservative Party Peerage. 

Ms Brady, who is from Birmingham but has a home in Knightsbridge, was also accompanied by co-chairman Lord Feldman of Elstree as she made her entrance.

She was introduced as 'Baroness Brady, of Knightsbridge in our city of Westminster', but will be known simply as Baroness Brady. 

After repeating the businesswoman, signed the Upper House's code of conduct and then shook hands with Lord Speaker Baroness D'Souza. 

She was then greeted by leader of the House Baroness Stowell of Beeston before leaving the chamber to change out of her robes.

She then rejoined the Chamber to hear questions. 

It comes after Ms Brady spoke out in favour of stay-at-home mothers saying their work should not be underestimated or treated as menial.

Ms Brady donned traditional ermine robes for the occasion, wearing her trademark hair in loose curls over a fur collar

The mother-of-two praised women who committed themselves to staying at home, admitting she found being a housewife 'unrewarding' when she spent five months away from work between 2009 and 2010.   

Speaking ahead of today's ceremony, the businesswoman, who became the managing director of Birmingham City FC at the age of 23, said she admired women who give up work to raise children. 

'I had five months where I didn’t work and I found it really unrewarding. Because all the things you do at home are just taken for granted,' she told the Daily Telegraph. 

'I think that's a great shame because actually being at home and dedicating yourself to your family is a wonderful thing and should never be underestimated.

Ms Brady, who previously said taking just three days maternity leave following the birth of her daughter was 'shameful', added: 'It's not something I chose for myself...But it's not menial work and it should never be considered as that.'

Flanked by her friend and Labour Peer, Lord Alan Sugar and Conservative Party co-chairman Lord Feldman of Elstree, Ms Brady took her seat in the House today. 

All three were dressed in ermine robes as Lady Brady pledged her allegiance to the Queen.

Since her early twenties the businesswoman says she has had to fight against gender stereotypes in the workplace after finding success in a male-dominated industry. 

After becoming the managing director of Birmingham City FC in 1993, she took the club from the brink of bankruptcy to an estimated worth of £82million. 

Karren Brady, pictured with her husband Paul Peschisolido and their children Sophia and Paolo, said staying at home to raise children should not be considered menial work 

The 45-year-old was named in August among 22 new Conservative Party political peers selected by Prime Minister David Cameron. They are pictured together at the party's conference in Manchester earlier this year

She is now the vice chairman of West Ham United, sits on the boards of Phillip Green's Arcadia and Simon Cowell's SyCo and acts as Small Business Ambassador to the Government. 

But the businesswoman has expressed regret in the past for sacrificing time with her family to ensure professional success. 

Taking such a short break from work following the birth of daughter Sophie, now 18, was 'a mistake,' she said. 

'That was shameful, really. It was a mistake and most people would look at it with shock, as they should.'  

Earlier this year Ms Brady revealed Sophia had been working part-time in a clothes shop near the family's Solihull home to learn about the working world, and is paying her way through a film studies degree with a student loan. 

She is the eldest of Ms Brady's children with her husband, former footballer Paul Peschisolido. The couple also have a 16-year-old son, Paolo. 

Speaking of her daughter's part-time job in Hollister, she said: 'It helped her realise there is a whole world outside school of different experiences and places.' 

After becoming the managing director of Birmingham City FC aged 23, Ms Brady (pictured in the role in the early Nineties, left) took the club from the brink of bankruptcy to an estimated worth of £82million. Today Brady sits on the board of various multi-million pound companies and acts as a Small Business Ambassador to the Government 

Earlier this year Ms Brady was awarded a CBE for services to entrepreneurship and women in business by Prince William.

Speaking of the accolade, she said: 'It has been difficult over the 20 years, things are getting better.

'But I think if women like me don't campaign for other women who's going to do it, so I take it seriously.'

'I think it's important that young women have good role models and it's important that if you put yourself forward as a role model you take that job seriously.'

Ms Brady is among 22 new party political peers announced by Prime Minister David Cameron in August.  

There are 192 women in the House of Lords, the fewest belonging to the Conservative Party of which just 26 per cent of peerages belong to females.
