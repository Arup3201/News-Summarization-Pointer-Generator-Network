Blood from a murder scene will be used to determine if a convicted killer is the father of his victim’s children.

In the bizarre case, the murderer, who is serving a life sentence for stabbing his girlfriend to death at their London home, wants to keep in touch with her two young children.

He is not named on their birth certificates and refuses to take a paternity test, insisting he ‘knows best’ and that he fathered them.

So social workers who are  looking after the children made the highly unusual request to the High Court for permission to use forensic material from the crime scene. They want the issue resolved either way for the sake of the children.

Because the knifeman is believed to have cut his own wrists while attacking the woman, blood likely to be his own was found in the house and stored by Scotland Yard.

By comparing a copy of the DNA profile of this blood with that taken from the two children, lawyers for the local authority say they can establish if he was their father.

None of those involved can be named in order to protect the children’s identities.

Both the Metropolitan Police Force and the Home Office opposed the application, as did lawyers for the killer.

The authorities said that the highly sensitive database of criminals’ genetic material was not meant to be used to resolve family disputes, and would therefore open the ‘floodgates’ to other requests for samples.

There are also strict rules about the use of evidence seized by police, while individuals – even convicted  killers – have the right to keep their medical data private.

But Sir James Munby, the president of the Family Division, overruled their concerns and allowed copies of the murder scene DNA profiles to be compared with those  of the children.

He argued that the move was justified in this case because the children had the right to know if the man who killed their mother was indeed their father.

Sir James said: ‘How can therapy or counselling be arranged, how is the children’s psychological integrity to be preserved, if the paternity issue is not resolved?

‘In these circumstances the balance, in my judgment, comes down in favour of the children.’
