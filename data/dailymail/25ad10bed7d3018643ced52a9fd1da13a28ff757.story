Bullied every day: The family of Joel Morales, 12, who hanged himself after years of abuse from classmates, are suing the four bullies

The devastated family of a boy who hanged himself are suing the schoolboys that allegedly bullied him.

Joel Morales, 12, committed suicide after a two-year barrage of bullying because of his small stature, according to his family.

Now the boy’s family from East Harlem, New York have filed a law suit against the city, the Board of Education and four youths.

His mother, Lisbeth Babilonia, said the bullies hassled Joel every day, throwing pencils and taunting him.

In the suit, Joel was described as ‘a small-framed, fragile boy who sometimes stuttered and had problems with fine motor skills. He was extremely short and underweight for his age’. 

He also suffered from unspecified anxiety disorders according to the Daily News.

The allegedly bullies were named as Kenneth, Stephen, Omar and Elijah ‘Doe’ and their parents were named as defendants.

The schoolboy was ‘the target of ongoing severe, brutal physical and emotional abuse and harassment’ by his peers at Public School 102 in East Harlem, according to the suit.

Ms Babilonia complained to the Board of Education several times and eventually the school set up a meeting with the perpetrators’ parents.

After the meeting, the boys allegedly went to the apartment block where Joel lived and threw pipes and sticks at him.

Ms Babilonia’s lawyer Tedd Kessler said of the meeting: ‘It didn’t alleviate the situation at all.’

Joel was transferred to nearby Public School 57 but the bullies followed him after school.

The boy was found dead in his family’s apartment on May 31 last year.

Ms Babilonia was left bewildered by his 
actions. She said: ‘Every morning he always said “I love you mum. Give 
me a hug and a kiss.”’

At the time of Joel’s death, it was 
revealed that his father had committed suicide some 13 years ago when he
jumped off a rooftop in New York's Bronx borough.

Neighbours told how Ms Babilonia let out a 'blood-curdling scream' as she cut down her son's body with a knife before plunging the blade into herself.

Neighbour Inez Rodriguez, 41, said that he knocked the knife out of Ms Babilonia’s hand as she tried to harm herself. He also tried to give Joel CPR.

Relatives said the boy was teased for being short and brainy but the final tipping point were taunts about his dead father. Joel was 4-months-old when his father died.

Richard Salazar, 25, Babilonia's other son said to the New York Post last year: 'She’s going through the same thing she went through then.'

The boy's aunt Angelica Babilonia, 23, said he told a friend just hours before taking his life: 'I’m tired of all this bullying.'

In
April this year, Rehtaeh Parsons from Nova Scotia, Canada hanged herself after 
four boys raped her and spread a photograph of the assault, causing 
classmates and friends to taunt and cyber-bully her, her mother has 
said.
