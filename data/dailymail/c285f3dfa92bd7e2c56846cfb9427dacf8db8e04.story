Egypt has stepped up its crackdown on the
smuggling tunnels linking the country to the Gaza Strip.

So before any more of the passages are destroyed by buldozers or dynamite, photographer Mohammed Salem decided to take the plunge, literally, to explore these underground trade routes.

He had to make an enormous effort to obtain a permit from the Hamas-run 
interior ministry because there is a ban on photography in this area for
apparent security reasons.

Once he had the permit, he headed straight to 
the area where I was stopped at several police checkpoints before 
finally getting to one of the smuggling tunnels.

Writing on Photographers Blog, he said: 'It took me a few 
minutes to take in the area and see the real situation with my own eyes,
not as it is described by others.

'Hundreds of tunnel entrances were 
covered by tents in an attempt to hide the location and Egyptian army 
tanks were close by, guarding the border.

'I was surprised and a bit frightened to see a 20 meter-deep hole, and 
wasn’t so happy about going down into the dark. Abu Mohammed encouraged 
me, saying that you descend on a rope operated by an electric generator,
assuring me that the rope was strong enough to carry heavy construction
materials.

'I tied my cameras around my body and the adventure began.'

Once into the tunnel, Salem is warmly greeted by the workers down there who are busy repairing walls and realises that there is a whole maze of tunnels, operated by different groups.

'It was not an easy hour,' he added. 'It was very hot and humid, and shooting 
pictures was very difficult due to the weak light. Even breathing was 
not as easy as I thought.'

The workers didn't appear afraid of the Egyptian security forces' clampdown on using the tunnels, and certainly weren't put off their coffee breaks.

The tunnel network was established as a result of a blockade intensified
by Israel after the Hamas movement seized Gaza Strip from its rival 
Fatah in 2007.

Rest time: Egyptian security forces have stepped up a crackdown campaign on smuggling tunnels between Egypt and the Gaza Strip since July

Egyptian security forces have stepped up a crackdown 
campaign on smuggling tunnels since Egypt’s Islamist president Mohammed 
Mursi was toppled last June.

They are used to transfer cheap fuel and commercial goods into the Palestinian territory.

Pro-Palestine Campaigners say the 
crackdown is having dire consequences on people living in Gaza who are 
now effectively locked in.

As a result of the clampdown the costs of food and building materials are said to have risen have risen.

The crackdown has also dealt a blow to 
Hamas, which for years has collected taxes from the movement of goods 
through the tunnels.
