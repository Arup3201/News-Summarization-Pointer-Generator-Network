Chelsea will begin the defence of their Barclays Under-21 Premier League title against Manchester City on August 15, with last season's beaten finalists Manchester United opening their campaign on the same night against Norwich.

The fixtures for the new season of Under-21 action have been released, with selected matches to be screened live on Sky Sports and BT Sport for the first time.

There is also a new format, with the previous 22-team division now split into two leagues of 12 with the play-off format scrapped.

New campaign: Chelsea will begin the defence of their Under-21 Premier League title against Manchester City on August 15

So close: Manchester United, last season's runners-up, will take on Norwich City in their opening fixture

Each side will play the others in their division home and away, with two relegated and two promoted between the leagues at the end of the season.

Chelsea beat Man United 2-1 at Old Trafford to take the crown last season, with young stars Charly Musonda and Lewis Baker on target.

Just last week, first team boss Jose Mourinho tipped Baker and other starlets Izzy Brown and Dominic Solanke to go on to play for the England team and that he would be to blame if they didn't.

Chelsea beat opening day opponents Man City on penalties in last year's semi-finals and they are set to meet at Aldershot Town's Recreation Ground on the evening of the 15th.

United, whose rising stars James Wilson and Tom Lawrence made their first-team debuts at the tail end of last season, will face Norwich at the Leigh Sports Village on the same evening.

Making the leap: Lewis Baker has been playing for Chelsea's first team during their pre-season matches

Matches will predominantly be played on Thursday, Friday and Monday evenings, book-ending the weekend's Premier League and Football League schedule, and more than ever will be played at the club's main stadium.

Everton, Fulham, Leicester City, Liverpool, Southampton, Sunderland, Tottenham and West Ham also make up Division One.

The 12 teams in Division Two will be Arsenal, Aston Villa, Blackburn Rovers, Bolton Wanderers, Brighton and Hove Albion, Derby County, Middlesbrough, Newcastle United, Reading, Stoke City, West Bromwich and Wolves.

Brighton and Derby are new additions to the Under-21 top flight after their academies gained Category One status.

Stepping up: Man United Under-21 striker James Wilson adapted to lift in the first team at the end of last season

The Premier League say the Under-21 matches will be made to feel as much like senior games as possible, with the pre-match handshake, perimeter advertising and interview backdrops.

Each club must host at least three of their Under-21 matches at their main stadium, giving fans another chance to visit places like Old Trafford, Anfield and the Emirates.

Teams are allowed to field three overage players plus a goalkeeper over the age of 21, with first-team managers often utilising the games to assess the fitness of stars returning from injury.
