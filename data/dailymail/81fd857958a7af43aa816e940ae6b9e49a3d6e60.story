A manhunt has been launched after a 12-year-old girl was raped by two men.

The girl was in Walthamstow, east London, between 12.15am and 12.30am on Saturday when she met three men, Scotland Yard said.

She was taken to a garage area at the end of Hibbert Road, near Theydon Street, where she was pinned down and raped by two of the men.

The girl managed to call a friend who came to the scene and they left together. The suspects then left the area.

Manhunt launched: A 12-year-old girl was raped by two teenagers near a garage area in Hibbert Road (pictured), Walthamstow, just after midnight, police have said

The girl, who reported the rape on Saturday, did not know any of her attackers, Scotland Yard said.

The trio are described as being between 17 and 19 years old.

The first was dark-skinned and of mixed race, with a diamond stud in his left ear and a London accent. He told the girl his name was Mo and that he was 17.

He had big brown eyes, short hair, was very skinny and wore a black puffa-style jacket with a hood, black chinos, black trainers and a grey/black T-shirt.

The second was described as black and very tall with big lips. His hair was partly shaven and he wore black trousers and a red and blue shirt.

Investigation: Scotland Yard detectives said it was a 'nasty attack on a vulnerable girl'

The third, who did not rape the girl, was black and had a moustache. He wore a blue-coloured hooded top and a red and blue cap, and told her his name was Miles.

Detective Inspector Simon Ellershaw, who is leading the investigation, said: 'This was a very nasty attack on a vulnerable girl just 12 years old by a group of older males who engaged her in conversation before leading her to a secluded area.

'She was pinned down and two of the males then brutally raped her.

'I would appeal for anyone with information or any witnesses to please contact police as soon as possible.'

Anyone with information is asked to call police on 0208 217 7408 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
