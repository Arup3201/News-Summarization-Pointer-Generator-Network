More employees are ditching the old-fashioned phone calls and using  text messages or emails to call in sick instead.

But Australian workplaces have increasingly cracked down the technology-based sickies unless they are legitimately too sick to call, a leading recruitment agency told the Herald Sun.

The Fair Work Commission has warned employees that if they are caught on social media spending their day off, rather than being 'sick' in bed, they could face the consequences of getting fired.

Workplaces are increasingly cracking down sickies through text and email

Marketing and advertising company Brand Easy Australia director Andrew Fabien told Daily Mail Australia that he would prefer his employees to make a phone call when they're sick.

'Majority of my staff are aged between 18-30 and most of the younger ones definitely prefer contacting us via text or email rather than a phone call,' he said.

'I don't mind if they text the night before but if they're going to text me the morning before their shift, it'll definitely get under my skin because it doesn't give me enough time to prepare work and organise someone else to cover their shift.

'When an employee  texts me at the last minute, to me, I personally think they just couldn't be bothered going to work that day or just some lazy excuse to get out of it.

'I've always asked my staff to be courteous about calling in sick. At this stage, I haven't considered banning texts or emails but if it does get to a point, then I'd have to go down that path.'

Mr Fabien also added that he has seen Facebook posts from employees going out the same night they called in sick for work that day.

'I never confronted them but it just reflects their work ethics and integrity,' he said.

'For example, as an employer you would think twice about promoting someone with those characteristics.'

Brand Easy Australia proprietor Rakesh Joshi told Daily Mail Australia that it's very unprofessional to text but a phone call would sound more genuine.

'When you call, your boss has the ability to hear your voice and is less likely to think you're lying about your condition,' he said.

Fair Work Commissioner Leigh Johns told the Herald Sun: 'If they publicise the fact that they have taken an illegitimate sick day, it's more likely than not that there will be consequences.

'It could be a valid reason for termination, depending on the circumstances of the case, such as being warned in the past.'

It's been reported that 15,000 annual unfair dismissal cases have used social media posts against employees who  revealed they were out and about after calling in sick, according to the Herald Sun.
