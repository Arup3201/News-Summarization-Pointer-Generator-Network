Olympic ceremony mastermind Danny Boyle has revealed the Queen actually volunteered to appear in his James Bond sketch.

TV viewers around the world were stunned to see the Queen with 007 actor Daniel Craig in the spoof sequence during the opening ceremony prior to her arrival in the Olympic Stadium.

In an interview with ITV's Jonathan Ross Show to be screened tonight, Boyle revealed he had originally envisaged a lookalike for the film part.

He said Helen Mirren was being lined as a double until the Queen asked to play herself and insisted on a speaking part.

Director Danny Boyle: He had hoped Helen Mirren would play the Queen during his James Bond spoof

The creative director of the  2012 opening ceremony said: 'It was part of the protocol - you have to bring in the Head of State and sing the National Anthem - and we thought we'd [do] something different so we wrote up this idea of the James Bond idea.

'And we sent it in to them, and we were asking really for permission for them to accept that it wouldn't embarrass them and we'd get a double, a good double, and we were thinking Helen Mirren.

'Who could we ask who's a really good actor?

'They came back and said 'we're delighted for you to do it, and Her Majesty would like to be in it herself' - and the surreal thing, 'she would like to play herself'.'

Mr Boyle, who is promoting his new film 
Trance, added: 'She said 'what do you want me to do?', and I told her 
and she said 'fine'.

'So we got in and we started doing it 
and then she said 'don't you think I should say something?' and I said 
'yes, OK, what do you suggest?'.

'She said 'I'll do something' and we started shooting and she turned round and she said her lines beautifully.'

In the spoof, a stuntman dressed to look like the Queen jumped out of a helicopter and parachuted to the ground at the Olympic stadium.

The interview will be screened on ITV tonight at 9.20pm.

Earlier this week, Boyle declared the feel-good factor that spread across Britain because of London 2012 is dead.

He believes the positive spirit has been crushed by economic gloom.

Mr Boyle said he felt the positive impact of the Games before they started and after they ended.
