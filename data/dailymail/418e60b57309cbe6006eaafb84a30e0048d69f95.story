Elegant: Ri Sol-ju, the wife of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, dressed in her smart trouser suit for a tour of a tile factory in Pyongyang

The First Lady of North Korea has caused another stir among watchers of the Stalinist regime by eschewing convention to step out in a stylish trouser suit.

Former pop star Ri Sol-ju, wife of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, wore the stylish black trouser suit during a visit to the Taedonggang tile factory in Pyongyang.

Most residents of the city, the country's capital, only ever wear drab coloured Mao-style suits and North Korean women generally dress only in conservative skirts.

Ms Ri's appearance in the unconventional outfit comes just weeks after she was pictured at an event with what looked like a luxurious Dior evening pouch.

The appearance of Ms Ri, who is thought to be in her 20s, was enough of a fashion statement to incite comment over the border in South Korea, the Daily Telegraph reported.

South Korea's Yonhap news agency noted that female officials in the North are rarely seen in trousers. Ms Ri's elegant appearances in national media are seen as a sign that Kim is trying to raise the country's aspirations.

The country of 24 million has suffered severe food shortages since a famine in the mid-1990s killed hundreds of thousands, but the state's totalitarian rulers have copious personal wealth and are said to live a lavish lifestyle.

It is unclear whether the bag is genuine or an imitation, but South 
Korea's Joong Ang Ilbo newspaper said it would cost 1.8 million
won (£1,017) in the capital, Seoul.

Glamorous twenty-something Ri Sol-Ju has sparked intense media interest since she was unveiled as the wife of 28-year-old Supreme Leader in July this year.

A former pop singer, the attractive 
young woman has been photographed in a range of chic yet conservative 
outfits which recall the lady-like style of Kate Middleton or Carla 
Bruni.

Contrast: Ms Ri's appearance is out of sync with her companions on the factory tour. North Koreans tend to dress sombrely, with women in particular expected to wear conservative skirts

Luxury: Ri Sol-Ju, wife of North Korea's Supreme Leader Kim Jong-Un, has been pictured sporting what appears to be a Christian Dior handbag

The picture which revealed her costly 
bag was released by North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency earlier this month, 
and was taken as the leader and his wife visited a unit of the 
Korean People's Army.

In contrast to his wife, Kim was clad in his customary Mao-style dark suit.

Ms Ri has previously been snapped in a red polka dot jacket, black dress and somewhat nervous smile while attending the opening of an amusement park. 

At the completion ceremony of the Rungna
People's Pleasure Ground, where Kim was photographed beaming on a 
fairground ride and shaking hands with an octopus, she looked modest and
comfortable in a green and black dress.

Later, she appeared in an elegant black suit, side by side with her somberly dressed husband.

Ms Ri's taste - and presumably, budget - for shift dresses contrasts sharply with the everyday dress of her countrywomen, which tends to reflect their position in society.

While
some women favour a traditional kimono-style garment called the 
Choson-ot, many wear either military uniforms or drab office-wear 
reminiscent of British fashion in the Nineties.

Matching: The young couple look more austere in co-ordinating black suits

However, recent reports suggest the Supreme Leader is following in his grandfather's footsteps by relaxing clothing rules for women.

Previously they were only allowed to wear trousers while working in factories or on farms, but now skinny jeans are starting to be seen on the streets - along with high heels and earrings.     

According to South Korea's Yonhap 
News Agency, the new Mrs Kim received etiquette training for about six 
months before taking on the role of first lady.

When news of their union emerged, foreign intelligence agencies suggested Kim and his bride had first become romantically involved a decade ago, when he returned home from his studies at a private academy in Switzerland.

It was claimed that Kim’s late father, Kim Jong-il, had ordered him to end the relationship, so that Ms Ri ended up marrying an officer in the North Korean army instead.

Kim is the world's youngest ruler, and the announcement of his marriage has been seen as a bid to stress his maturity in a culture which places a high value on family life.
