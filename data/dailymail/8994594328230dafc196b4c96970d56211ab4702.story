Cyrus' parents Billy Ray and Tish have yet to release a statement but a source close to the family say the couple are 'thrilled' and have always seen Liam as 'one of the family.'

Miley once named the Australian as her 'first serious boyfriend' after 
teenage romances with Nick Jonas and model Justin Gaston.

The couple met while working together 
on 'The Last Song' in 2009 and Liam, 22, has previously  admitted while 
he wanted to be professional on the film, they couldn't help but fall in
 love after working so closely together.

He said: 'What happened happened, and we've been together since.

'She makes me really happy. When you 
start, you want to be professional, but when you're filming those scenes
 with someone and pretending to love them, you're not human if you don't
 feel something.'

It hasn't been the smoothest of relationships; The couple 
announced that they had split in August 2010 but were back together 
within a month. They broke up again in November last year before 
reconciling again.

Former Hannah Montana star Miley is 
one of the highest-earners in showbusiness, and topped a list of the ten
 richest teens in Hollywood last year with a personal fortune of 
$120million.

Liam, meanwhile, is a rising star, who this year broke into the big time with his starring role in The Hunger Games.

Previously, he was best known for his relationship with Cyrus and as The Avengers star Chris' younger brother.

It has been a happy time in the Hemsworth family of late, with Chris becoming a father for the first time just last month.

Miley has been eager to shed her former squeaky clean Disney image for the past few years, and last month voiced her opinion on 'magical, beautiful' sex.

'Sex is actually really beautiful,' she said during an interview on The Conversation. 'It’s the only way we create, and it’s the only way the world keeps going.

'So it’s ignorant not to talk to your kids about it or not make it seem as magical or cool as it actually is. Kids have a TV, so they know what sex is. So educate them and let them know… it’s a beautiful thing, and it is magic, and it’s when you connect with somebody.'
