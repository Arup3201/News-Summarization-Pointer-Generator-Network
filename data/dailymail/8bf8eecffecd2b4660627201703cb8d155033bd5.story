When officers arrived, Mrs Grace told them she and her husband had had a fight, and he grabbed the 18-year-old pet and marched upstairs.

There he drop-kicked the animal and ditched it at the wall.

She said Mr Grace had become angry because the cat urinated in his boots.

'She did urinate in his boots, but it was like a month ago or more, and the boots were on the floor,' Mrs Grace told Koco.com.

'He hadn't thrown them out. He saw them at that moment and for whatever reason, he snapped.'

She said she was still mourning the elderly but beloved pet.

'She slept with me every night,' Mrs Grace said. 'I still miss her purring in my ear every night. It's been horrible. I just feel cheated out of the last little bit of her life. She was wonderful.'

Police pulled Mr Grace over near the 1000 block of southbound Interstate 35.

Officers said he admitted to killing the cat.

'(He) killed her right in front of me and my son -- my 14-year-old son,' Mrs Grace said.

She said she couldn't imagine what may have set him off, but she added 'we're all terrified still.'

Mrs Grace said she has filed a restraining order against her husband.
