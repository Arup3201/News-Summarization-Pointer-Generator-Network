John Carver will use Sir Bobby Robson as inspiration as he bids to win the Newcastle United’s manager job on a permanent basis.

The caretaker boss has revealed that Robson – who he served under as assistant for five years - told him to seize any chance he ever had to take charge of the Magpies.

And Carver admits he has picked up Robson’s autobiography in the days since he was asked to take care of first-team matters in the wake of Alan Pardew’s decision to quit Tyneside.

The pair worked together at St James' Park as Robson led the Magpies into the Champions League 

Carver says Robson is never far from his thoughts  

‘For some reason, I started reading Sir Bobby’s autobiography,’ said the 49-year-old ahead of the visit of Burnley.

‘I read about me and Craig Bellamy (fighting) at the airport and all that. It was quite funny.

‘There was a message at the front of the book – “thanks for a fantastic, successful five years, it should have been a lot longer, cheers, Sir Bobby.”

‘When he gave me that book, he said to me, “you do realise how big this football club is and if ever you get an opportunity, don’t be scared of it, enjoy it and take it with both hands”.

‘So I am sitting here now and I’m going to take it with both hands.’

Carver enjoyed his only caretaker game in charge of his hometown club following Robson’s sacking in 2004. The Magpies won 3-0 and Robson telephoned Carver the night before to wish him luck.

And he believes his old mentor will again be looking down on him this afternoon.

‘I’m a catholic and I believe he will be looking down on me, I really do,’ said Carver, who will also take charge of Saturday’s FA Cup third-round tie at Leicester City.

‘That was why I had the inspiration to get the book and started reading it. He talked about the time he went to Canada, similar to myself because I went there.

‘Lots of things started coming back into my head. He will be there with us. He will be in the technical area with us, let me tell you that, because I never stop thinking about him.

‘Apart from my mum and dad who I lost recently, there are two people I never stop thinking about - he is one of them and Gary Speed is the other.

Alan Pardew left Newcastle earlier this week and will take over at Crystal Palace

‘They are always with us, and I think about them every game. They were good football people. And both of those figures understood what it meant to play and manage at this football club.’

Carver could well be handed the role on a full-time basis until the end of the season at least should he impress over the coming week.

And the former academy head concedes it would be impossible to refuse such an offer.

‘Of course it is (my dream job),’ he said. ‘I’m a local lad and it’s a dream job for anybody.

‘When I first had the conversation with Alan before I came here, he said to me, “do you have aspirations to be a manager again?”.

Carver says landing the Newcastle job would be a 'dream' for any local North East lad 

‘I explained that I had done it in Canada with Toronto and I enjoyed it, I loved it, but the fact that you’re bringing me back to my football club means I'm quite happy to be an assistant.

‘In your head, though, you always want to do it. If you asked 100 assistant managers, I think 99.9 per cent would say they would want to do and they would be lying if they didn’t.

‘But that’s not something for now, for me. Now is preparing the team for Burnley and trying to get the right result for the club.

‘Let’s get two wins and then we’ll address it after that.’
