CCTV images show the moment masked robbers took a west London boutique by storm - before disappearing with more than £150,000 in designer handbags.

Shoppers cowered in fear when a pair of raiders burst into the Designer Exchange in Knightsbridge yesterday in a targeted robbery in broad daylight.

The audacious raid has sparked anger in the exclusive shopping district, with the store's managing director branding the police response 'lacklustre' and calling officers 'deflated' and 'broken'.

Shop boss Dominic Durante said Kensington and Chelsea needs police officers patrolling the streets in marked vehicles and suggested design giant Chanel might make 'a large contribution'.

In a statement about the incident, Mr Durante said: 'Eventually the police arrived, lacklustre and broken. This was not a force to be reckoned with, this was a deflated, beaten, disillusioned sorry lot who had seen it all before and were helpless to do anything about it.'

He went on: 'We and all the other stores in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea can continue to put up barriers to protect our staff, customers and goods, hire security guards and install locked, bullet-proof cabinets.

'We can continue to expect desperate people to take what they can't afford or take advantage of opportunities that currently are so available.

Two men entered the store at 4.30pm before stealing more than 20 Chanel, Hermes, Birkin and Kelly handbags

Staff pressed a panic button during the robbery, in which the store's smoke alarm was also activated

'Or we could think outside the box and tell retailers to open their doors and feel free to allow the world to see, touch and buy freely without risk because everyone knows that the police are outside to ensure law and order.

'Simply, we need numbers, bobbies patrolling and marked vehicles circulating.

Store owner Dominic Durante has criticised the police over the raid, branding their response 'lacklustre' and 'deflated'

'Every other minute a police presence should be around. There should be no need for shutters or alarms because everyone will know that only a crazy fool would take the chance.

'Protect this very special square mile. Us retailers would be happy to pay for the extra police presence. I'm pretty sure Chanel would make a large contribution to start the ball rolling.'

His scathing attack came after Scotland Yard said police in the area were appealing for information and witnesses following the raid in Egerton Terrace at 4.30pm.

It is claimed two unarmed masked men entered the store and seized a number of high-value handbags before making off in a dark-coloured vehicle.

No arrests have been made and no one was injured.

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police responded to the criticism today, insisting officers do patrol the area.

He said: 'Officers attended the Designer Exchange in Egerton Terrace within six minutes of the initial call to police.

'Unfortunately, the suspects made off prior to police arriving. Four officers and a sergeant were initially assigned to the call and attended the scene. A search of the local area was conducted.

'Two scene of crime officers and a detective constable attended to take forensic samples, witness statements and initiate a thorough and detailed investigation within two hours of the crime taking place.

'Officers from Kensington and Chelsea do patrol the area with officers assigned to locations based on intelligence gathered from local communities and predictive crime pattern analysis.'

The store's owner said shops are like sitting ducks due to the lack of police patrols in the area

On the Designer Exchange website, it says: 'We love designer handbags. We aim to revolutionise this second-hand industry and want to give our customers a better way to buy, sell and exchange.

'We guarantee all our handbags and accessories are authentic as it is vital to give our customers peace of mind when paying for such high-value items.'

The store's Instagram account describes it as a 'Knightsbridge-based prestigious boutique with rare, vintage, new & pre-loved designer handbags.'
