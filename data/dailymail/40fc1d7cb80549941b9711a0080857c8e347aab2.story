A Texas man has been put to death 11 years after robbing and fatally beating a delivery woman who had brought him doughnuts.

Anthony Doyle, 29, was given a lethal 
injection on Thursday for the death of Hyun Mi Cho, 37, who he beat with a baseball bat before stealing her car, phone and 
credit cards in Rowlett in 2003.

After the injection, Doyle took a few breaths and began to snore quietly before he stopped moving, the Dallas Morning News reported. He was pronounced dead 25 minutes later, at 6.49pm.

Doyle did not make a statement before his death, a Department of Criminal Justice spokesman said. Texas ended its tradition of preparing a requested last meal for death row inmates in 2011.

Executed: Anthony Doyle, 29, left, was put to death on Thursday for robbing and fatally beating Hyun Mi Cho, right, to death in Dallas in 2003. She was delivering food to his parents' house when he attacked her

No one from Cho's family attended the execution, but a friend of Doyle's and spiritual adviser he had picked were present.

His execution came more than 11 years after Cho, a South Korea native, was killed while trying to earn money to care for her ill parents back home.

She was delivering an order of doughnuts and breakfast tacos to Doyle's parents' home when she was attacked by the then 18-year-old.

When placing the food order, the caller had apparently faked an elderly woman's voice and Cho was wary, but had delivered to the address before.

But when she arrived, Doyle answered the door and invited her inside before demanding her money.

Scene: After beating her with a baseball bat in his parents' home on this street in Rowlett, he dumped her body in a neighbors' trash can and stole her credit cards and car, which he was seen using

Responding that she had none, Cho was attacked with a baseball bat and her body was dumped in a trash can in an alley. Doyle then shared the food with friends.

A neighbor taking out garbage discovered Cho's body.

Police were already looking for her when she was found, and Doyle's sister told officers that she had found a brown spot on a carpet at her parents' house.

Investigators found blood splatters on the ceiling and kitchen walls, and learned that Doyle had used barbecue sauce to try to cover the blood. He then tried to clean the scene and repaint the walls.

Doyle, who was also seen driving Cho's car and trying to use her credit cards, was arrested at a friend's home in Dallas, then gave police a 10-page written confession.

He told investigators he was under pressure from parents and his girlfriend to support his three-week-old daughter, but that he was unable to get a job.

In an attempt to stop his execution, Doyle's attorney had argued that he deserved a new punishment hearing because jurors at his trial were presented with false evidence that was unknowingly false about his inability to be rehabilitated.

Ahead of Doyle's execution, Texas, which has executed more people 
than any other state since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976, 
obtained a fresh batch of its execution drug, pentobarbital, the 
Department of Criminal Justice said, without revealing the 
source.

On Thursday, a state
 judge ordered Texas to release the name of its new drug supplier and 
the state attorney general's office said it would appeal the ruling.

Other
 U.S. states have been struggling to obtain the drugs after 
pharmaceutical firms, mostly in Europe, imposed sales bans because they 
object to having medications used in lethal injections.

Oklahoma
 has had to postpone two executions planned for this month because it 
could not find drugs. Alabama said this week it has run out of one of 
the main drugs it uses, stalling 16 executions.

Attorney Lydia Brandt had argued the 
defunct Texas Youth Commission, a military-style juvenile boot camp 
where Doyle was sent, wasn't capable of delivering adequate 
rehabilitation. The boot camp model designed to 'break behavior' is now 
prohibited after abuses were exposed.

She
 argued that it was unlikely that Doyle would be sentenced to death if 
he were on trial today, but prosecutors argued that Doyle had struggled 
with discipline for years.

The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a 
last-day appeal to block Doyle's execution. He was the fourth person 
executed in the state this year and the 512th in Texas since the death 
penalty was reinstated.

Texas plans to execute five more inmates before the end of May - around the same number as every other state combined, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.

But overall, executions have been on the decline in Texas, after hitting a peak of 40 in 2000. Since 2010, Texas has averaged about 15 executions a year, Reuters reported.

The drop is due to the high costs of prosecutions and the availability of a sentence of life without parole. In recent years, there have been 10 or less.

'We are now very selective in what we choose to go after as death penalty cases, instead of deciding that every single murder that we try will be a capital case,' Susan Reed, the district attorney in San Antonio and a death penalty supporter, told Reuters.
