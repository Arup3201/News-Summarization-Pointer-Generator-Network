Ed Miliband is facing a party divided over Europe as senior Labour figures urge him to change his mind on holding an EU referendum.

At the weekend Mr Miliband refused to commit to an in/out vote, claiming it would be bad for the country.

But a group led by former Europe minister Keith Vaz has launched a campaign to convince him otherwise.

Divided: Labour leader Ed Miliband is now facing a rift in his party after he refused to commit to holding an in/out referendum so the British people could have their say on whether they wanted to remain part of the EU

Yesterday the Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls warned that the Opposition should not ‘set our face against consulting the British people’ – but added that now was not the time to announce a change of heart.

Mr Balls, who is said to be pushing for a commitment to an EU referendum in Labour’s next manifesto, said he thought the party should ‘acknowledge the deep concerns in the country’ over the subject. The rift emerged after Mr Miliband gloated at the weekend that the Tories are ‘hopelessly divided’ on Europe.

Mr Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said: ‘I believe that it is the democratic right of the people to make that decision [EU membership] for themselves.’

The leader of the Labour for a Referendum campaign, party donor John Mills, said: ‘We all want to see Prime Minister Ed Miliband in 2015 and the best way to ensure that happens is by telling the people we too will give them a say on the EU.’

Labour MPs who support the campaign are said to include Ronnie Campbell, Rosie Cooper, John Cryer, Ian Davidson, Natascha Engel, Frank Field, Roger Godsiff, Kate Hoey, Kelvin Hopkins, John McDonnell, Austin Mitchell, Grahame Morris and  Graham Stringer.

One Foot in the Grave star and Labour campaigner Richard Wilson is also backing the campaign.

‘Any sensible Labour Party member should support Labour for a Referendum,’ he said. ‘As a pro-European I want to put the issue to bed once and for all.’

Mr Balls told Sky’s Murnaghan programme that the party would have to address the issue, but added it would be wrong to do so now.

‘I think we have to acknowledge the deep concerns in the country at the direction the European Union is taking,’  he said.

‘If we give the appearance ... that we’re burying our head in the sand, we’re just going to ignore those things, people  would say “they are as out of touch as David Cameron”.’

However, he added that Labour should concentrate on EU reform first, stating: ‘I don’t think it’s sensible, it’s not wise, it’s not balanced and it’s not statesmanlike for political parties, for their short-term political advantage, to start making claims about referendums when we don’t even know where we are going to be.’

Nonetheless, he stressed: ‘I don’t think we should set our face against consulting the British people.

‘But I think if we were to start answering your question by saying “well, maybe in two years’ time...” we play the same destabilising, political, tactical, short-term game which is actually making David Cameron look like he’s not really fit to be prime minister at the moment.’
