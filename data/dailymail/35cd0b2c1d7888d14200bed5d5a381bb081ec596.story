A father has spent nearly two decades unable to feel excited or sad, after a freak motorbike accident in his youth left him brain damaged.

Army veteran Matthew Rhodes, 39, from Tarleton, Lancashire, was just 20 when he was hit by a car while stationed in Germany.

Although he has since married and had a son and daughter, Mr Rhodes has not been able to feel excitement since the accident. This is because his injuries damaged the part of the brain that deals with emotion.

Long way back: Since Matthew Rhodes, 39, pictured with children Bethany, 11, and Harry, seven, was hit on his motorbike aged 20, he has been unable to feel excitement or sadness

Mr Rhodes suffered severe head injuries in the accident in 1995 and spent the following ten weeks in a coma.

The former soldier was left virtually blind, semi-paralysed and the part of his brain which deals with emotion was almost wiped out.

Despite doctors saying he would never walk again, he has since had a remarkable recovery and in 2000, met his wife Michelle, now 45 - although due to his short term memory loss it took him a year-and-a-half to remember her name.

Mr Rhodes said: ‘I still struggle with names - I even get my children’s names  mixed up all the time. I am fine with numbers, but names and places I just can’t remember.’

Happy, but not excited: Mr Rhodes med Michelle five years after the accident, but was not struck by nerves on his wedding day in 2002

‘And when I came out of my coma I was talking gobbledegook, but to me it sounded like perfect English.

The couple married in 2000, and have since had two children, Bethany, 11, and Harry, seven.

But neither his wedding day or the birth of his children sent Mr Rhodes on to the roller-coaster of emotion most people would experience.

He has now written about his experiences in his book called Never Say Die and raises money for charity Blind Veterans UK.

Mr Rhodes said: ‘People say that I am very "one level", especially in my facial expression.

'I’m never bothered by much, just very relaxed. I don’t get excited, ecstatic, or desperately sad - I just have one level now.

Calm life: Mr Rhodes is more interested in spending time with his family and painting than the thrills of soldier life

‘I never had a proper laugh, I’m just quite nonplussed about things.’

With the support of his family, he has defied doctors who said he wouldn’t walk again and through gruelling physiotherapy, has regained some mobility.

The limbic system is the collective name for structures in the human brain involved in emotion, motivation, and emotional association with memory.

There are several main parts of this system, including the hippocampus - the memory centre - and amygdala - the fear centre and the hippocampus.

Damage to the limbic system can severely affect a person's memory and emotional response to events,

Luke Griggs, spokesperson for Headway,
 the brain injury association, said: ‘A brain injury can effect 
everything we do, think and feel.

‘The
 emotional and behavioural impact of brain injuries can be devastating 
for individuals and families alike and can include an inability to 
control anger and irritability, a lack of empathy and a general lack 
control over one's emotions.

‘Recognising and understanding these changes is a vital part of rebuilding one's life after brain injury.’

Mr Rhodes said: ‘I just crack on with 
things, there is no point letting it get me down.

'When I was a soldier I
 would say I would rather be dead than disabled, but now I see how 
foolish I was.

‘Since my accident I have married my wife and had two fantastic children, whom I love dearly.'

Mr
 Rhodes expresses himself through painting, and despite having limited 
vision, he has learnt how to paint with the help of charity Blind 
Veterans.

But although he has worked hard to overcome his physical disabilities, he has found his emotions stay the same.

His wedding to Michelle, for example, was somewhat subdued experience.

Mr Rhodes said: ‘It was a fantastic 
day and the weather was beautiful but beforehand I didn’t have 
excitement for it. It’s just part of who I am now, to have emotions on 
one level.’

Mr Rhodes, a 
former soldier in the 1st Battalion Devonshire and Dorset regiment, had a
 glittering career in the army ahead of him.

He
 served in Germany, Canada and did a tour of Bosnia, was one of the 
fittest in his regiment and was the top gunner for the Infantry tank.

Mr Rhodes was lucky to survive the accident and while he was in a coma his weight dropped from 12 stone to five-and-a-half.

Mr
 Rhodes said: ‘I am paralysed on the right hand side from my nose to my 
toes but even though the doctors said I would never walk again I have 
proved them wrong.’

He no longer uses a wheelchair - instead, his right leg is encased in a
 plaster cast, but he is able to walk around and has even completed the 
London marathon, in one day and ten hours.

He has also accepted that he won’t experience the same highs and lows in life as other people do.

‘I
 just get on with it. My children have given me a reason to live.

'When I
 was in the army I travelled all over the world and was always kept 
busy.

‘After my accident my life completely changed and I could no longer complete my ambition of rising up the ranks in the army.

‘But
 now I have the kids, it gives me a task to do, a task which will always
 be there and I’ll always be looking after my children no matter what 
age they are.’
