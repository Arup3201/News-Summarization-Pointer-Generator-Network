Tottenham are poised to complete their protracted signing of Sevilla central defender Federico Fazio after paying his £8million buy-out clause.

Sportsmail revealed last week how Spurs were closing in on the 6ft 4in Argentine, and the deal is now virtually complete after the Premier League club made the transaction.

Fazio will sign a four-year deal at White Hart Lane before the weekend.

Tottenham have moved quickly to tie up a move for Fazio after a deal for Villareal defender Mateo Musacchio fell through over third-party ownership issues.

The 27-year-old will replace club captain Michael Dawson, who completed his move to Hull City yesterday.

Dawson joins Steve Bruce's side on a three-year deal for an undisclosed fee, understood to be £6million.
