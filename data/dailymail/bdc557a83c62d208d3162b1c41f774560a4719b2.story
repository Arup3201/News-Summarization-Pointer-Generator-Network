A British teacher who claims she was gang-raped in Thailand today broke her silence to say that police had treated the attack as a joke.

The 20-year-old, who had only been in the country for two weeks, said that officers had made out she was 'some drunk idiot'.

And she said that the situation was made even worse by allegations that she had not been attacked and was only crying rape.

'I think I'm still in shock. The first night after I was raped I was very upset, I was tired and cried quite a lot,' she said

'Now, I can't cry, I just feel numb. As soon as I enter my family's company I think I will just break down.'

The alleged scene of the crime: Police comb the second-floor balcony of the building in Nakhon Si Thammarat, Thailand, where a British student was found weeping

The woman, who is from Fort William, was 
allegedly attacked by four men and raped by two of them as she walked 
home from a night out at around 3am on Friday.

Speaking from the city of Nakhon Si 
Thammarat in the south of the country, she said: ''I had had a few beers at a restaurant with a friend and we moved on to a bar where I met another friend.

'I can remember a lot of that then things are unclear, I can only remember little things.

'I do not know if my drink had been spiked or what. There was a kafuffle with the bouncer there and we left at around 2.45am.

'I told my friend that I would get back home fine, it was not too far away. The police have told me that I was told to leave the bar because I was too drunk, but I can't remember if that was true.

'I was awoken on the balcony of a building around 50m away from the bar.

Allegations: The British student said she was gang-raped in Nakhon Si Thammarat, southern Thailand

'The police and other people that lived 
nearby woke me up. At that point, I did not have a clue what had 
happened or what was going on, but they were saying I was still drunk.'

The woman added that she had a clear 
description of two of her attackers. She said: 'I do not remember 
certain parts of what happened, and I do not remember what order they 
are in.

'I can remember a silver car or a pick-up truck and I think that is what the men who attacked me drove in.

'I remember it was raining, I remember there were four of them and I remember the attack happened on a concrete floor.

'I remember quite clearly what the two men who raped me looked like.

'One
 was wearing a black T-shirt and the other was wearing a green khaki 
T-shirt, he had black hair and a gap in his teeth or a tooth missing.

'They
 hit me in the face and on my head. There are bruises on my arms from 
where they held me down and my elbows and knees have been scraped.'

Police
 probing the attack have said they are waiting for forensic reports from
 the hospital where she was treated while their enquiries continue.

But the woman has hit out at the way the authorities have dealt with her since the assault.

She said: 
'I've given three statements to the police using two different 
interpreters, I feel like I'm going round in circles with them.

'They tell me one thing and then 
another, they've said something about a bouncer at the bar taking me 
home and dropping me off, but he can't remember where that was.'

She added: 'I still haven't received 
anything back from the police, or from the hospital for tests for 
diseases following the attack.

'How come no-one in nearby houses 
heard anything happening? I was screaming and shouting during the 
attack, there's no chance they never heard anything.

'The
 police have said the people living nearby just thought it was a fight 
and didn't do anything. The police and authorities are very humiliating,
 their whole system has let me down.

'They're making out that I was some drunk idiot and it was my fault, which was not the case.

Destination: Thailand is popular with British tourists, particularly students, with thousands visiting every year.

'They started asking me questions about my relationship with my boyfriend, which is not relevant at all to this, it just seems like a joke to them.'

The distraught woman is travelling home to Scotland after the ordeal forced her to abandon plans to begin teaching in the region.

She said: 'It's been a horrific experience and the whole thing with the media has made it a lot worse.

'They have made me look like an idiot who was drunk, they also said my boyfriend had left me at the bar, which he hadn't.

'He was travelling down from Bangkok at the time and had nothing to do with it.

'What they've reported has been quite disturbing.'

The young woman called for her attackers to be brought to justice but said she feels like nothing will be done.

She said: 'I hope there's some way this can be resolved. Those men need to be caught. I just really want to go home, I want to go and see my family and get proper help, but I'm stuck in a foreign country where no-one speaks fluent English.

'When I get back to the UK I want to report this to the police who will understand me and I want to go to a hospital that can help me after this.

'My family are very supportive, they just want me home as soon as possible.'

She added: 'Leaving my boyfriend behind here because he can't get a UK visa just now is terrible.

'We have been living out of each others' pockets for the past few months. But it has ruined everything that I had planned out here.'

Jatuporn Mongkolkarun, who owns the bar where the young woman was drinking said that he had instructed a member of security staff to escort the young woman home as she was so drunk. 

Meanwhile, a witness who lives next door to the alleged victim said she heard her return home at 3.45am.

Noi Raksachon, 33, said she did indeed hear a man come to her 
room, but he encouraged her to go downstairs for fear that she would 
fall from the balcony.

She had earlier been in Rock 99
 Bar in Thawang Market before heading to the Nakorn Vientiane Restaurant
 - popular because it serves after hours drinks.

Police Lt. Col. Niti Boonjan, in 
charge of the investigation, said: ‘She had scratches on her body and 
she was taken to hospital for forensic tests. She was found crying on 
the second floor balcony.

Police are waiting the results of forensic tests. If
 she is found to have made false allegations, the young woman would face
 immediate imprisonment pending trial. She would also be presented with 
bills from the police and hospital.

In
 June last year Stevie Bamford from Sydney, Australia was jailed for 15 
days after making false rape allegations to police on the Thai holiday 
island of Phuket. Her sentence was cut in half because she pleaded 
guilty.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We are aware of a British national having been involved in a serious assault in Thailand. We are providing consulate assistance at this difficult time.'

Witnesses say that she was in fact escorted back to her room for her own safety because she was so drunk.
