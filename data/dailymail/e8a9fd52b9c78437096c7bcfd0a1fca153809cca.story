Kevin O'Connell was killed on Saturday after he was hit by a car when he tried to intervene in a fight

A Good Samaritan was run over and killed in front of his children after he stepped in to help when an argument broke out on the streets.

Father-of-three Kevin O'Connell pulled over while driving to step in and help the victim of an alleged assault when he gave chase and was hit by a car in Derby.

Witnesses said one of the 33-year-old's daughters, who was waiting in the car with her two siblings, called for an ambulance following the incident at around 1pm on Saturday. 

Derbyshire Police said Mr O'Connell was hit by a passing car when he tried to intervene in a fight between two men.

East Midlands Ambulance service said he was taken to the Royal Derby Hospital, but were unable to confirm whether he died on arrival.

Sergeant Darren Muggleton, who is investigating the incident, said: 'We are in the early stages of the investigation but it appears that Mr O'Connell had stopped his car to try to break up a disagreement between two men.

'One man ran off and Mr O'Connell was chasing him when he fell into the path of a car that was passing. This tragic incident was witnessed by his three children. He died a hero trying to help a member of the public he thought was being victimised.'

Two men, aged 27 and 34, who were involved in the argument were arrested on suspicion of assault on each other and were bailed after being questioned. 

The driver of the car was not arrested but was spoken to by officers at the scene. 

A woman who lived close to where the crash happened told how she was alerted to the tragedy by someone screaming.

She said: 'It was a terrible accident. We could hear screaming outside and knew something was wrong from that.

'I was crying and upset. I think of the poor kids - this will stay with them for the rest of their lives.

'I walked to help them because it is just natural. You do feel a little useless afterwards, but we could not have done more.

'He must have been a special person to pull over and he obviously had something about him. If I saw what he saw, I don't know if I would get out of my car. It takes guts. He stopped his car to help and is a hero. I'm sure he was a genuinely nice guy.'

The incident happened on Burton Road in Derby close to the Car Parts Direct store on Saturday afternoon

Family friend Tracey Bricknell, 50, from Findern in Derby, said: 'My heart and thoughts go out to all the family. It is a tragic accident - Kevin was loved by everybody. He was very friendly and outgoing and has been taken too young.

'He has a very strong family unit, they are all together. His mum talks about the family all the time.

'They are a lovely and down-to-earth family and I know the funeral will be huge, absolutely huge.'

Social media was flooded with messages paying tribute to Mr O'Connell.

Martin Edwards wrote: 'RIP Kev. My heart goes out to all your family. Never forgotten.'

Richard Yeomans added: 'My thoughts go out to you and your family. I'm really sorry to hear about it.'

The father-of-three has been described by family friends as a 'hero' who was 'very friendly and outgoing'

Gary Woolley wrote: 'What can one say? A fantastic lad, a fantastic family.

'I just cannot believe it. My thoughts are with you all. God bless you all.'

Officers have spoken to several witnesses and are conducting house to house enquiries to gather information about exactly what happened. 

Witnesses or anyone else with information about the incident have been asked to contact Derbyshire Police.
