A Tory MP lost control of his Mercedes-Benz, hitting a portable toilet, several parked cars and a discount store wall.

Banbury MP Sir Tony Baldry said his parked car ‘shot off’ as he opened the door to pick up a dropped parking ticket in Banbury, Oxfordshire before he was due to meet constituents. 

The car veered through a car park, hitting a portable toilet before going over a 3ft drop on to a busy road where it crashed into the wall of a Poundland store and then a van and three stationary cars in a council car park in Banbury, Oxfordshire yesterday at 4pm.

Lost control: Tory MP Sir Tony Baldry lost control of his Mercedes-Benz, crashing into a portable toilet, parked cars and a Poundland store wall

Sir Baldry said his car 'shot off' after he opened the car door to pick up a dropped parking ticket

The car, plastered with blue toilet paper from the loo, only ground to a halt when it hit concrete bollard in what Sir Baldry, 62, described as ‘very scary’.

One witness said blue toilet paper from the portable loo, used by car park attendants, was left stuck to the car's windows and doors.

One bystander said: ‘I just couldn't 
believe what was I was seeing. Then when he got out I saw it was the MP 
Tony Baldry I was amazed.

‘It must have travelled about 200 yards before stopping.

Despite Sir Baldry trying to regain control of the car, it collided with a van and three parked cars including this one

Sir Baldry said it was a 'very scary incident' but that the owners of the damaged cars were 'extremely understanding'

‘Usually the road is really busy and schoolchildren are around but it was lucky it was only the cars he hit.’

‘Mr Baldry looked rather sheepish getting out of the car.

‘All he kept saying was, “I just couldn't stop it” and “I didn't want to hit the wall”.

‘I was there thinking what about all the cars you've just hit.’

It is understood that Sir Baldry returned a negative breath test to police, a standard police procedure in car crashes.

He told The Sun last night: ‘It was a very scary incident for everyone concerned including myself.

‘I tried to stop it. My right foot was outside the car as the car was accelerating.

‘I was seeking to avoid hitting anything. No one was injured.

‘Those whose cars were hit were extremely understanding.’

The car crash comes a month after a Swedish politician Aron Modig survived a horrific car accident in Cuba that killed two others.
