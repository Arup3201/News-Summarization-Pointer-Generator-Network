Ed Miliband was left red faced after a party member quizzed him about a ban from talking to voters about the economy

Ed Miliband was left red face when a party activist revealed they had been warned from mentioning public money to voters, it has been reported.

Retired party member Cecil Jenkins said the directive had been issued by Labour bigwigs in London because 'it's not our strong point.' 

The latest embarrassment comes just months after Ed Miliband forgot to mention the budget deficit during his party conference speech.

Mr Jenkins, aged in his 80s, quizzed Mr Miliband on the ban after the Labour leader addressed the Fabian Society conference, the Telegraph reported.

The newspaper said the pensioner from Hampstead, North London, asked: 'We have been told by London region not to talk too much about the economy because it is not one of our strengths.

'Can this conceivably be true?' 

A bewildered Mr Miliband was forced to deny members had been barred from talking about the economy.

'We should talk about the economy as much as possible between now and general election, because they have failed,' Mr  Miliband reportedly responded.

Back in September the Labour leader faced criticism when he forgot to mention the Britain's budget deficit and immigration during his speech at the Labour Party conference.

One shadow minister said the meandering, 68-minute address was ‘the worst speech by a Labour leader I have ever seen’,

Then, he blamed the embarrassing omission on ‘one of the perils’ of speaking without notes.

‘If I did the speech again today, I would do it differently,’ he said.
