She was the former merchant navy sailor turned sixties icon, cabaret star, baroness and one of the most famous beauties of the age.

But April Ashley's pretty face hid a secret. She had been born a boy named George Jamieson and, at the age of 25, became one of the first people to undergo gender reassignment surgery.

Now her incredible story is the subject of a new exhibition, April Ashley: Portrait of a Lady, which opens tomorrow at the Museum of Liverpool.

Pioneer: 60s model April Ashley, 78, was the first Briton to undergo gender reassignment surgery

'I'm very excited,' revealed Ashley, now 78. 'I could never have 
imagined that when I left Liverpool sixty years ago I would one day 
return to an exhibition about my life in the Museum!'

'April has had an astonishing life but 
throughout it all she has fought for her rights, and provided advice and
support for those suffering similar discrimination,' added curator Gary Everett.

Born in 1935 in Liverpool, the former George Jamieson was one of six children born to a father serving in the navy and an abusive mother.

'She used to hang me upside-down and bang my head on the floor,' Ashley explained, in a candid interview with the Telegraph.

'She also whipped me so badly that there was a hole in my back the doctor could put his thumb into.'

Desperate to get away, Ashley joined the merchant navy at 14 but it proved an unhappy experience, compounded by the fact that at the age of 15, she remained sexually underdeveloped.

Discharged after attempting suicide, she was sent to a mental institution in Omskirk before being released and moving to London in 1950.

Here, her astonishing transformation began, speeding up after she moved to Paris and became a cabaret drag queen, performing under the name of April E.

By the age of 25, April, who says she had felt that she was in the wrong body from the age of three, had concluded that dressing and living as a woman wasn't enough and in 1960, she underwent gender realignment surgery at the hands of pioneering surgeon Dr Georges Burou in the Moroccan city of Casablanca.

'I knew I couldn’t have gone on living like that,' she told the Telegraph of her decision to submit to a type of surgery that was then in its infancy.

'Anything was preferable, really. And, as soon as I woke up, I had the most extraordinary feeling. Even though I’d lost a lot of blood and all my hair had fallen out, it was as though my brain was in tune with the rest of my body for the first time in my life.'

After a lengthy recovery, April returned to the UK where her modelling career took off courtesy of appearances in Vogue and shoots with photographer David Bailey.

But her origins - and her operation - remained secret until in 1961, a 'friend' sold her story to the Sunday People.

The fall out was devastating and both her modelling and fledgling film careers were crushed by the scandal.

After being 'outed' as transsexual, April's life - in particular her romances - regularly made the headlines, including her 
controversial divorce from The Honourable Arthur Corbett - later 3rd Baron Rowallan – 
in 1970.

The judge ruled that April remained a biological man and the 
marriage was therefore invalid and annulled - setting a legal precedent that endured until 2004 when the law was finally changed.

Since then, she has lived a wonderfully full life, claiming to have had affairs with Omar Sharif, Michael Hutchence and Grayson Perry albeit while struggling to scratch a living as a waitress, hostess and art seller in Paris.

Recognition: April is presented with her MBE for services to transgender equality by Prince Charles in 2012

Two years ago, April moved home to the UK and now lives in a south London flat. She also, in 2012, was awarded an MBE for services to transgender equality.

Nevertheless, she has admitted that she still feels a sense of isolation, despite her achievements and the growing public acceptance of transgender people.

'I’m so tired of being told I’m loved,' she said, speaking to the Telegraph, 'and then people don’t even bother ringing me up to see how I am.'

With the launch of the new exhibition, perhaps that will finally change.

April Ashley: Portrait of a Lady runs until September 2014 at the Museum of Liverpool. See liverpoolmuseums.org for more information.
