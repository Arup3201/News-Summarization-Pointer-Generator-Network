Cash: Politicians are angry that Tony Halsall, former head of the University Hospital of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust, was given a package worth £250,000 when he stepped down

The head of a health trust which had the highest mortality rate in England received almost a quarter of a million pounds in severance pay, it was revealed last night.

Tony Halsall was paid the sum after leaving his post at University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust in disgrace last year.

The trust in Cumbria is currently the subject of a police probe into up to 16 needless baby deaths as well as the deaths of two mothers.

And in a scandal which has been compared to that of Mid Staffordshire, recent data shows a total of 500 people may have needlessly died in the last four years.

Yesterday, politicians reacted with fury at the payout, saying it was cheating taxpayers and ‘rewarding failure’.

Mr Halsall stepped down in February 2012 but still receives his salary of £150,000 a year, which will only be cut off in October this year.

It is understood the payments, which equate to £225,000 overall, were viewed as a severance package.

Local Lib Dem MP Tim Farron said: ‘The level of this package will shock people – £225,000 is too much for the failure that he presided over.’

After Mr Halsall stepped down, he agreed to go on ‘secondment’ for 12 months. As part of the deal, he is also entitled to his existing benefits, his lease car and the costs of career management advice up to the value of £5,000. He will also be paid during a six-month notice period.

He was gagged from talking about  it and the trust has until now refused requests to reveal the scale of the payout.

MPs suggested they chose to release the information on Budget day in an attempt to ‘bury’ the news.

During Mr Halsall’s tenure at the trust, it was criticised on several occasions by watchdogs including the Care Quality Commission and the Commons health select committee.

Police are investigating deaths at Furness General Hospital, in Barrow, one of its two main maternity units.

A total of 30 families are reported to be taking legal action against the trust over mother and baby deaths and cases of cerebral palsy.

Managers have been accused of covering up patient deaths as they chased the prize of foundation trust status.

Morecambe Bay became a foundation trust in 2010 despite warnings from the regional director of the NHS regulator that patients’ lives were in danger. In 2011 it had the highest mortality rate of any trust in England.

A new report into the CQC’s regulation of the trust, due to be published this month, is expected to find that it had failed to take adequate action to protect patients.

John Cowdall, chairman of the trust, said the arrangement with Mr Halsall ‘avoided the potential for a long drawn out dispute that would have been expensive and time consuming’.

The deal involved going on secondment to NHS Confederation as an associate director. The national body represents all those organisations which provide health services and speaks on their behalf.

It is understood he took the role on condition that he would be paid his salary of £150,000 a year by the trust up to October 5, 2013.
