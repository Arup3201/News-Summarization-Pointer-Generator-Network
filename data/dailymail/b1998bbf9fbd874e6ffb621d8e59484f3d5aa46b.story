Williams have handed promising British driver Alex Lynn a boost in his bid to become a Formula One driver.

Lynn last season was crowned champion of GP3, one of the main feeder series to F1, and this year will drive in GP2 with one of the primary title-contending teams in DAMS.

To further assist the 21-year-old from Essex, Williams have appointed Lynn as their development driver for this season.

In the role Lynn will focus on using the team's simulation tools to help with the ongoing development of the new car, the FW37, as well as assist in its setting up ahead of each grand prix.

Lynn will also get behind the wheel of the car for one day's testing in Barcelona following the Spanish Grand Prix in May.

A delighted Lynn said: 'I hope with a strong year in GP2, while also helping to develop the F1 car throughout this season, I can follow in the footsteps of Valtteri Bottas who joined Williams in exactly the same development driver role.

'Through hard work and determination, he has gone from winning the GP3 title to earning his place as a Williams F1 race driver.

'Working with people like Sir Frank Williams and Pat Symonds is an incredible opportunity for me.

'There is so much experience here at Williams and I hope to be able to use the knowledge gained from these people to further develop my skills as a racing driver and respected member of this team.'

Highlighting Lynn's potential, deputy team principal Claire Williams said: 'As a British team we are always on the lookout for emerging home-grown talent and Alex has caught our eye with his impressive performances in GP3.

'He has been chosen on merit, and we are confident alongside Felipe (Massa), Valtteri and Susie (Wolff), Alex will help play an important role in making sure the FW37 shows continuous improvement over the course of the 2015 season.'
