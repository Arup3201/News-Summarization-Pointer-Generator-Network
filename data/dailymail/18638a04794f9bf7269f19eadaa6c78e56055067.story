Television weatherman Fred Talbot has been arrested by detectives investigating allegations of sexual abuse at a boys’ school up to 40 years ago.

Police said the 63-year-old, best known for appearing on a floating weather map for ITV’s This Morning, was held on suspicion of indecent assault and inciting a child to commit acts of gross indecency.

The allegations relate to four former pupils of Altrincham Grammar School for boys in Greater Manchester between the early 1970s and early 1980s.

Mr Talbot was appointed  biology master at Altrincham Grammar in the 1970s. He went into TV in 1984.

Yesterday police swooped on his 
£500,000 semi-detached cottage home in Bowdon, Cheshire, and conducted a
four-hour search of the property and gardens. Officers have said that 
the alleged offences did not take place within school grounds.

Detective Chief Inspector Koran Sellars called on former pupils to assist with the investigation.

She added: ‘Since allegations were 
made to police in December we have made good progress with this 
investigation and with tracing and speaking to former pupils of 
Altrincham Grammar School.

'However, I am eager to trace anyone who 
attended the school between the early 1970s and 1980s who feels he may 
have information to assist the investigation.’

The inquiry into Mr Talbot began after
publicity about a separate investigation into allegations of historic 
sexual abuse of pupils at a nearby Roman Catholic boys’ school. Last 
December, officers smashed down the front door of his 18th-century 
cottage while he was away lecturing on a cruise ship.

Mr Talbot was later taken ‘off air’ at
ITV’s Granada Reports North West news programme although he was not 
formally suspended as he was working on a freelance basis.

In a recent interview he said he had been ‘left in limbo’ after the police raid.

His agent Dave Warwick said officers had not been in contact and had never explained why they broke into his home.

He said: ‘Obviously, he has been worried and concerned about it the whole time. It has been hanging over him.

‘There was no need to raid his home like that. All they had to do was ask me for a key and I would have let them in.’

Tim Gartside, current headmaster of 
Altrincham Grammar School for Boys, said: ‘These are historic 
allegations and concern events, as reported, that took place outside the
school. We are co-operating fully with the investigation.’

Mr Talbot presented the weather from a
map moored outside This Morning’s offices in Albert Dock, Liverpool, 
often in a highly-coloured sweater, until the programme moved to London 
in 1996.

 In 1998, he was named Weatherman of the Year at the Annual International Weather Festival in Paris.

In 2007 he was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Science by Manchester Metropolitan University.
