The nation's students are set to launch the next stage in their angry campaign against the tertiary overhaul, as laid out in the Budget.

While the decision to provide support for the US mission in northern Iraq has diverted attention, albeit briefly, from stalled Budgetary measures in the Senate, they will shortly take centre stage again.

With more than $1 billion ripped out of higher education funding, universities have been offered a sweetener, effectively giving them the opportunity to charge what they feel is a market competitive price for courses.

University students have vowed to step up their campaign against the planned overhaul of tertiary education

Once upon a time. The PM (left), Treasurer (centre) and Education Minister (right) in their younger days. Collectively their university courses cost about $6000, according to the NUS. Students say the planned reforms to tertiary education means just one of the courses they undertook could cost upwards of $100,000 in future

Then and now. The marked difference between the fees when the Prime Minister, his Treasurer and Education Minister undertook tertiary studies and what those same courses cost today. The National Union of Students says law and medicine will top $100,000, if Budget measures on education get through

In essence, universities will need to recoup those losses by bumping up course costs by as much as 30 per cent by 2016. 

Ultimately, that means the most popular courses will be driven up, pricing many out of tertiary education, according to National Union of Students (NUS) President Deanna Taylor. 

'The government has made it clear that they intend to massively deregulate the higher education system and move towards a United States-style system, which would inevitably lead to fee hikes,' Ms Taylor said. 

'It's not an exaggeration to say you won't get much change out of $100,000 for the most popular.'

National Union of Students president Deanna Taylor (left) says future student protests against Budget measures to overhaul higher education will focus on Treasurer Joe Hockey's time as a campaigner against increased university fees and charges

She said those from lower socio-economic or disadvantaged backgrounds will find it almost impossible to 'follow their dreams'.

'Universities across the country which have the most market power, those with prestige and reputation on their side will be able to send what they charge for certain courses, through the roof,' she said. 

The National Union of Students president added that those proposing fee deregulation have short memories.

'Just stop and look at what our decision-makers paid for their degrees and what we are asked to pay now and what we will have to pay in the future, with no guarantees of a job or support after graduating.' 

The NUS has accused the Treasurer in particular of 'hypocrisy', referring to the then Arts and Law student leading protests in 1987 against the proposed $250 administration fee.

Ms Taylor said that back-flip by the one-time pro-student campaigner will be highlighted in the lead-up to the next national day of action on October 16.

'This is a massive overhaul they are proposing. It's not just the deregulation of fees, the huge cuts in funding, it's also the impact of interest rates and changes to the Newstart allowance,' she said.

Education Minister Christopher Pyne said tertiary students were in fact 'the big winners'.

He said Budget measures would ensure that there will be 80,000 more student places by 2018.

'They'll benefit by more revenue for universities leading to more research and better quality teaching.

'In return the government is asking on behalf of the taxpayers that students contribute 50 per cent of the cost of their education when they're currently contributing 40 per cent.

'We are asking for a 50/50 split, when currently it is 60/40 in favour of the student.'

The Education Minister has been a constant target of student anger since the plans for a tertiary overhaul were announced in the May Budget

But Ms Taylor said the Education Minister has missed the point.

'How is it right that anyone and everyone aspiring to be a lawyer or doctor, taking on those traditional degrees of law, medicine, dentistry and the like should have to pay off a debt effectively the size of a second mortgage, just to get an education?'

'These are people who will one day provide a vital service to the community and they're being punished for it, twice. If they can't find a job in the legal professions, they don't get any support from the government once they have finished studying, that's grossly unfair.'
