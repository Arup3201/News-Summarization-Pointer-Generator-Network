She's a picture of professionalism when on duty as a judge during BBC's Strictly Come Dancing.

But normally cool and composed Alesha Dixon lost control a little after she was offered a glass of wine on Alan Carr's Chatty Man last night.

As she worked her way through the rest of the bottle, the star offered her- extremely frank- 
thoughts on Strictly romances, the X Factor, and whether dancers are 
better in bed over the course of the rambunctious interview.

Loosening up: Normally cool and composed Alesha Dixon lost control a little after she was offered a glass of wine on Alan Carr's Chatty Man last night with Strictly fellow judges Craig Revel Horwood and Brunmo Tonioli

Things kicked off when Bruno accepted 
Alan's offer of a rosé, quipping 'Oh if you twist my arm', before 
admitting 'I'm anybodies after two glasses.'

Alesha took her generous helping with a civilised 'that looks lovely', while Craig demurred 'if it's the rosé'.

However things took a turn for the tipsy when Alesha let the boys shoulder most of the burden at the start of the interview, sipping steadily away as she sat between them.

The first sign of high spirits came when Alan asked the threesome how close they were to getting Pippa Middleton onto the show.

Can I tempt you? Everyone on Alan Carr's sofa was keen to quench their thirst

Alesha emitted a gleeful cackle, leaning back into the chair before agreeing enthusiastically to Bruno's suggestion that Alan should appear on Strictly.

Alesha admitted that she thought a 'boy could win this year', candidly saying 'The reality is, all the girls really like Harry.'

When Alan said that he felt sorry for aging dancer Anton de Beke Alesha, who'd nearly finished her tall glass of wine within a few minutes - interrupted with 'I don't' before bursting into yet more giggles.

Getting into her stride: Alesha drank the bulk of her first glass within minutes

She then plunged into juicier territory, declaring: 'Everybody is really frisky on the show though, you've got to be honest.'

She continued: 'Everybody is horny - the year I was a contestant everyone was really gagging for it' - at which point Bruno removed her now empty glass from her hand, exclaiming 'no more drink for you!'

Alan gasped 'This is chat show gold!', frantically grabbing the bottle to refill her glass.

Going to your head? Alesha was unable to stop laughing as her wine took effect

Two steps ahead, Alesha snapped 'give me the bottle'- seizing it with one hand and taking a long swig- lasting several seconds.

As Bruno and Craig collapsed with laughter Alesha picked up where the conversation had left off.

The audience still clapping, she ploughed on: 'As I was saying, eight to ten hours a day, rubbing up next to each other, of course you're going to get a bit frisky!'

Take it away! Bruno removed Alesha's glass as things started getting rowdier

Alan then pointed at Bruno, exclaiming 'look, he's touching  himself!' - to which the Italian replied: 'I can't help it, she gets me going!'

Bruno then commented on Alesha's claim, saying 'I've done it for nine years and I've never seen any boner.'

Alesha immediately rebuffed him, saying 'dancing is a very flirtatious sexual thing. Every year somebody gets together!'

'This is chat show gold!': Alan couldn't wait to pour Alesha another glass as her answers became increasingly graphic

She then contradicted herself, backtracking 'Well no-one this year, although there's always a rumour. I've not heard anyone this year. Boring.'

Alan then asked them whether they thought that good dancers are better in bed - to which Alesha enthusiastically replied: 'Well I should think so Alan!'

At this, Bruno removed the (nearly empty) bottle from her hand, and Alan showed the group a unbelievably raunchy clip from the Argentinian version of Strictly Come Dancing.

Throwing herself into the debate: Alesha said that the problem with X Factor is 'they focus too much on the drama, and everything else other the singing'

His tipsiest guest was stunned into a brief moment of calm by the sight of contestants across the pond gyrating naked on stage, but it wasn't long before she was back on exuberant form.

When Alan mentioned X Factor, Alesha gave a little victory jiggle, before diplomatically commenting 'I don't understand why we can't just enjoy both shows, I actually don't think the public give a sh**. It's the producers and the media. The public will just sky plus one and watch it later, they don't care.'

Alan commended her saying 'I can't believe Alesha's become the voice of reason after a whole bottle of wine!'

Rude not to! Alesha enthusiastically accepted Alan's offer of the whole bottle

He may have spoken too soon however, as Alesha continued 'The problem is Al, they focus too much on the drama, and everything else other the singing.'

Alan intercepted with 'You see at this point you've crossed the line from being a fun drunk to a violent one'.

Alesha took this in good humour, laughing uproariously once again before excusing herself 'you know what it is, I just feel like I'm at home with my mates having a gossip'.

Telling it like it is: When Alan asked whether dancers are better in bed Alesha immediately replied 'Well I should think so Alan!'

She then added: 'It's swings and roundabouts, next year they'll be beating us, the year after we'll beat them, who cares! Jog on Christmas.'

At this Bruno laughed 'If you can't beat them, join them, and downed his own drink.

A more bashful Alesha later took to Twitter  to excuse her uncharacteristic behaviour.

She wrote: 'Apologies for being pickled on Alan Carr! I did have fun though!'

'I am officially a light weight and clearly a cheap date!!! :) xxx'
