A dance student had her pelvis shattered when she was crushed against a wall by a giant snowball.

Nicole Wignall, 16, had spent almost four hours with seven friends making the snowball, which ended up 4ft wide and tall. The group then rolled it to the top of a hill near their homes in Blackburn.

But later, when Nicole was chatting to a friend outside her home, it was released by mistake.

‘I saw it happen but I froze,’ said Nicole. ‘I couldn’t move. I was screaming, trapped between the snowball and the wall. My friends moved it and I was carried to the house.

‘I thought I was going to die or be paralysed.’

Her pelvis was broken in four places at the front and fractured at the back.

Miss Wignall is now expected to be in a wheelchair for eight weeks before she can start walking again with crutches.

She has been told it will take a year or two before she can dance again.

‘It is so upsetting,’ she added. ‘But my pelvis was shattered, broken in four places at the front and fractured at the back.

'The doctor said it looks like I was on a motorbike and was smashed by a lorry. I could have been paralysed.’
