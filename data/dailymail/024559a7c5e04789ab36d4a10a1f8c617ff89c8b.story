The husband of actress Emma Thompson has said he and his wife will not pay a penny of tax until those involved in the HSBC scandal are sent to jail.

Actor Greg Wise said he and his Oscar-winning wife Thompson were 'disgusted' with the HMRC and HSBC after the tax row. 

He warned the couple were even willing to go to prison in their moral stand after the allegations earlier this month that HSBC's Geneva branch had helped its wealthy customers  dodge taxes.

'I want to stop paying tax, until everyone pays tax,' Wise told the Evening Standard.

The 'profound' socialist, who met Thompson on the set of Sense and Sensibility in 1994 when she was splitting up with Kenneth Branagh, claimed they loved paying tax but refused to pay any more until the row was resolved.

'I am disgusted with HMRC. I am disgusted with HSBC. And I'm not paying a penny more until those evil b******* go to prison,' he added.

'Em's on board. We're going to get a load of us together.  They can't send everyone to prison. But we'll go to prison if necessary.'

Although he claimed yesterday to live in a ‘poor bit’ of West Hampstead, Mr Wise and Miss Thompson in fact live on one of the most expensive roads in the upmarket North West London district.

Average house prices in the street, where Miss Thompson was born, are more than £2million – meaning that the Labour-supporting luvvies, who sent their daughter to private school, will also be expected to pay a mansion tax if Ed Miliband becomes Prime Minister.

Their peaceful tree-lined street, a 15-minute walk from Hampstead Heath, is home to Miss Thompson’s mother, the actress Phyllida Law, as well as Downton Abbey star Jim Carter. 

Other actors, television personalities, politicians and public figures living nearby include Stephen Fry and Bank of England governor Mark Carney.

The HSBC row came to light after an investigation by journalists claimed that its Swiss arm had helped wealthy clients such as sports stars, celebrities and politicians evade huge amounts of tax.

A trove of documents were leaked relating to accounts worth $100 billion held by more than 100,000 people and legal entities around the world. 

Details of thousands of UK-based clients of the branch were handed to authorities in 2007 by a whistleblower. But the reports did not reach Britain until 2010 after a deal between HMRC and the French authorities.

Officials say part of the deal was that the taxman could not pass on the details – but they have since been leaked.

Since then only one person has been prosecuted despite £135million being recovered. 

HSBC boss Stuart Gulliver has since admitted to the bank's shame over its Swiss tax scandal today as it disclosed profits slumped by 17 per cent last year.

But Wise, 48, was furious that HSBC had not been given even a slap on the wrist because, he claimed, the row fell into the grey area between avoidance and evasion.
