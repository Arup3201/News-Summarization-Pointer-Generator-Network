Two Waseca teenagers charged in a foiled explosives plot at a southern Minnesota school have pleaded guilty.

Austin Walters and Colby Radke both pleaded guilty last week to felony possession of explosive material. 

They were accused of helping classmate John LaDue detonate small 'test bombs' around Waseca, resulting in property damage. All three boys were 17 when they were charged.

John LaDue  (pictured being walked into Waseca County Courthouse in June 2014) was the instigator of the planned attack

LaDue is accused of plotting to kill his family and attack his school with firearms and homemade explosives, The Mankato Free Press reported.

Police and prosecutors don't believe the two teens were aware of his plot to attack Waseca Junior/Senior High School with explosives and firearms.

Waseca County Attorney Brenda Miller said she was pleased with the plea agreement.

'We tried to factor LaDue out of this case and treat them like any other young male who wanted to blow things up,' Miller said.

She added: 'We feel LaDue took advantage of them. So, we wanted to treat them like anybody else.' 

The teens are on probation for 180 days and must perform community service and write letters of apology.

Walters will also have to pay restitution for damaging an Oak Park slide and benches on the high school's softball field. Final sentencing will be on Februay 27.
