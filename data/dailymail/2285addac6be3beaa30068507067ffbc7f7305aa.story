Fiery end: The fossil, found in Turkey, is thought to be that of a large two-horned rhino once common in the Eastern Mediterranean region

The skull of a young rhino that was 'cooked to death' 9.2million years ago has been found preserved in volcanic rock in Turkey.

The preserved skull, found in Turkey, is thought to have belonged to a large two-horned rhino common in the eastern Mediterranean region during that period.

Unusual features of the fossil suggest the animal was baked to death in a volcanic flow similar to that which hit Pompeii in 79AD.

The rhino's grisly end was near-instantaneous.

'The body was baked under a 
temperature approximating 400°C, then dismembered within the pyroclastic
flow, and the skull separated from body,' researchers said.

This was followed by severe 
dehydration in the extreme heat of the volcanic ash, the flow of which moved 
the skull about 30km north of the eruption site, where it was 
discovered.

Less than 2 per cent of Earth's 
fossils are preserved in volcanic rock making the new find extremely 
rare, according to researchers from the University of Montpellier in 
France who unearthed it.

Although other researchers have previously identified fossils of soft-bodied organisms preserved in volcanic ash, organic matter near an active volcanic eruption is usually quickly destroyed by the high temperatures, they said.

Lead researcher Pierre-Olivier Antoine of the University of Montpellier in France told LiveScience his team found none of the rest of the rhino during their fieldwork.

'The articulated skull and mandible were found alone, and there were no other rhino bones in the surroundings, except for some rib fragments, potentially of rhino affinities,' he said.

The two-horned rhino, Ceratotherium 
neumayri, would have weighed between 3,300 and 4,400lb when alive, Dr 
Antoine said - about the same as a modern young white rhino.

The animal was a young adult between 10 and 15 years old when it met its fiery end.

Dr
Antoine said the external surfaces of the specimen were 'unusual', 
describing how 'the bony surface was rough and corrugated all around the
skull and mandible, and the dentine (the internal component of the 
teeth) was incredibly brittle, and even kind of 'corroded' [in] places.'

Microscope
examination of the remains revealed structural changes in the rhino's 
bones and teeth that suggested it had been heated to the high 
temperatures of the volcanic flows.

Dramatic landscape: Hot air balloons rise to the sky at sunrise in Cappadocia, central Turkey. Volcanic ash spread over millions of years then eroded produced the incredible scenery

'There was not a real volcano, but a caldera which spread huge amounts of volcanic ash over Cappacocia, during millions of years, throughout the late Miocene-Pliocene interval,' Dr Antoine told LiveScience.

Today the Çardak caldera is inactive, but over millions of years it has spread thick layers of volcanic ash across the surrounding area, creating a mangnificent landscape that surely holds many more wonders.

The find is described in a paper published in the open access journal PLOS ONE.
