First Fifty Shades: E.M. Hull published her erotic novel The Sheik in 1919 aged 39

We all know the story. 

One day, a frustrated, middle-aged housewife decides to write some erotic fiction for her own pleasure. 

The writing style is not brilliant, but what she writes is raunchy, involving a naive young woman forced to submit to a dominant older man, and pushed well beyond her sexual limits.

Quietly pleased, the author decides to publish. Interest is initially slow, but it picks up beyond her wildest dreams.

The book sells in its millions on both sides of the Atlantic, is made into a blockbuster Hollywood movie and the author earns a fortune.

All this success comes despite the fact this tale of abuse and sadomasochism is panned by critics, as ‘poisonously salacious’ and glorifying ‘lust and lechery’.

The author is not deterred. ‘I am old-fashioned enough to believe a woman’s best love is given to the man she recognises as her master,’ she states, and produces two equally saucy sequels.

You would be forgiven for thinking that this tale is about E.L. James and her mega-selling erotic novel, Fifty Shades Of Grey, the movie of which was released in cinemas at the weekend.

But it is actually the story of another British writer, a woman born 83 years before James, whose dazzling success with a piece of highly controversial erotica is an eerily familiar forerunner to Fifty Shades. Stranger still, even her name is similar: E.M. Hull. 

Today, her name is largely forgotten, but many will know the 1921 film that was based on her epically successful novel — The Sheik.

Starring Rudolph Valentino and Agnes Ayres, the film tells how a young British aristocrat called Lady Diana Mayo is kidnapped by a sheik, who holds her against her will until she falls in love with him.

However, the film is tame compared with the book, in which Diana is repeatedly raped — and there are strong hints that the sheik sodomises her — until she submits to his will and accepts she must be his for ever.

The notion that a woman can fall for her abuser is extremely unpalatable, and when Hull’s book was released in 1919, that sense of distaste was widely felt.

‘To state her theory concisely: the quickest way to reach a woman’s heart is a right hook to the jaw,’ wrote one critic.

B ecause of this apparent subtext, many believed E.M. Hull was a man. In fact, E.M. Hull was Edith Maud Hull, the 39-year-old wife of a Derbyshire pig breeder.

She was born on August 16, 1880 in London, the second child of a New York ship owner and his English opera singer wife.

The family was prosperous, and lived in a large house in Croydon. They holidayed on the Isle of Wight, and at some point moved to Hampshire.

Vanilla version: The film is tame compared with the book, in which Diana is repeatedly raped until she submits to his will and accepts she must be his for ever

In 1899, the 19-year-old Edith married a 30-year-old civil engineer called Percy Winstanley Hull, who came from a family of Derbyshire landowners. His father had been a barrister, and the Hulls lived in splendour in a large house called The Knowle, near the village of Hazelwood, five miles north of Derby.

A picture taken of Edith at her wedding — which is the only photograph of her to be published, and is printed here for the first time — shows the model of a Victorian bride, accepting of a life of predictable gentility.

In 1902, Edith gave birth to their only child — a girl called Cecil. The couple gave her a boy’s name because they’d wanted a boy — a measure of the immensely socially conservative world in which Edith lived, and against which she would rebel, at least on paper.

At the outbreak of war in 1914, Percy was called up. At 45, he would have been too old for the frontline, but it is likely his engineering skills were put to use.

It was while her husband was absent that a frustrated and bored Edith picked up her pen.

She said she wrote The Sheik ‘as a means of distraction at a time when I felt very much alone’.

‘Oh God! How she loved him!’ reads a typical passage. ‘Ahmed! And with a soundless cry the last remnant of her strength went all at once, and she fell weakly against the chief. He forced her to her knees, and, with his hand twined brutally in her curls, thrust her head back. There was a mad light in his eyes and a foam on his lips as he dragged the knife from his waistbelt.’

Another section reads: ‘Her body was aching with the grip of his powerful arms, her mouth was bruised with his savage kisses. She clenched her hands in anguish. “Oh, God!” she sobbed, with scalding tears that scorched her cheeks. “Curse him! Curse him!”’

Edith submitted her sadomasochistic tale to agent Curtis Brown, who sold it to a publisher in May 1919.

What happened nearly a century ago is a parallel to the Fifty Shades phenomenon. Publicised purely by word of mouth, the book was snapped up largely by women, despite — or more likely, because — it was described as ‘lascivious pornography’.

Copycat: Nearly 100 years later, an erotic novel written by a woman is once again dominating the bestseller lists and being turned into a Hollywood blockbuster - Fifty Shades of Grey

Unlike Fifty Shades, Edith’s book is not openly explicit, but the strong suggestions of violence, rape and sodomy were enough to make it sell 1.2 million copies in hardback alone.

We don’t know the total number of sales in all editions, but do know that The Sheik sold more than all the other bestselling books of the inter-war period put together.

Simiilarly, E.L James’s first novel in her Fifty Shades trilogy has outsold all seven Harry Potter books on Amazon’s UK site.

As a result, both women earned a fortune. For the last reported financial year, E.L. James’s limited company turned over £44 million, netting her a post-tax profit of £25.4 million in that one year.

Hull’s earnings were comparable. She sold the film rights to The Sheik for $5,000, which today would be around £500,000, and the theatrical rights for the equivalent of £100,000. Edith then sold the serial rights for three novels to a magazine for £300,000 at today’s value.

In 1923, an American film company bought the rights to another of Edith’s saucy novels, The Desert Healer, for £2.5 million in today’s money. And in 1925, she sold the sequel to The Sheik to Fox films for £2 million.

Including royalties for the eight books she published, she would easily have made the equivalent of £50 million.

Edith and her husband lived in luxury at The Knowle, where Percy took up breeding prize-winning pigs. Despite her success, Edith remained an intensely private figure, and did not even go to the first night of The Sheik when it was shown in Derby.

By some accounts, she was an austere figure. A great-niece recalled visiting her during the war, and being picked up from the station, despite petrol rationing, in a luxurious Daimler.

‘She was definitely of the “children should be seen, not heard” school of thought,’ the great-niece wrote.

In March 1944, Percy died at the age of 74. Edith died three years later, aged just 66.

Today, her legacy is still hotly debated. Some see The Sheik — aimed as it was at women — as being part of a rising tide of female emancipation, whereas other regard it as appallingly reactionary.

Whatever your view, there’s no doubt the phenomenon of Fifty Shades is a story that has been told before, and will be told again . . . by another unassuming woman who will make a fortune.
