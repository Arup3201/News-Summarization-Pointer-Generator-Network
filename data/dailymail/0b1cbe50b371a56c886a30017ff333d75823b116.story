It has hardly been a smooth ride, from the theft of cars to hackers stealing an early script - filming for the new Bond film Spectre has been hit by a string of disasters.

And yesterday it emerged the curse of Bond had struck again, after two crew members were injured in a car crash on set in Austria.

According to a source, filming was put on hold when one of the crew members was hit at high speed by a racing car during a stunt.

The driver lost control of the vehicle, sending it careering into the crew member and trapping them beneath the car.

Last night a spokesman for the EON productions, which is behind the James Bond films, confirmed  the accident had taken place.

And a relative of one of those injured in the crash said: ‘They were filming in Innsbruk [Austria] and the driver of the stunt car, a racing car, lost control. 

'The car crashed into someone, wedging them between the pavement and the car. And they had to be helicoptered to a hospital.

‘Another person was injured and was taken to a different hospital. The crash also damaged lots of the filming equipment, so none of the footage can be used.’

The crash is the latest disaster to hit Spectre since filming began at the end of last year.

Setbacks have included the theft of nine cars, hackers stealing an early version of the script and Daniel Craig, who is portraying Bond for the fourth time, spraining his knee while filming a fight scene at Pinewood Studios in London.

In recent days plans to shoot a funeral scene in a Rome cemetery were scuppered after a Christian confraternity banned the team from filming.

And they have also been blocked from shooting a chase scene at the Quattro Fontane site, where there are four 16th-century baroque fountains.

Last night filming had been put on hold to deal with the car crash. The cast and crew are thought to have been relocated to Rome, where filming it due to commence tomorrow.

According to a source, Bond bosses have got around the issue with the cemetery, which was to be the first Rome location, by agreeing to create a set nearby.

Among the material being shot in Rome is a car crash scene, which will see some of the city’s most famous streets shut down, with 800 security guards primed to accompany residents around the neighbourhood.

Spectre is the 24th film in the Bond franchise. It is due for release in October.

Last night a spokesman for the film said: ‘There was an accident on set today. Two crew members were taken to hospital, one has been released and another is being treated for a leg fracture.’
