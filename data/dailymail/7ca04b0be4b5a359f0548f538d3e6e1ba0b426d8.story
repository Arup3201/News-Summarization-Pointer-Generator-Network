These shocking images show Chinese vendors who guarantee their customers fresh donkey meat - by bashing the animals to death with a sledgehammer in front of them.

Lines of donkeys were seen tethered to the roadside awaiting execution so that the meat could be instantly butchered and sold directly to passing motorists travelling home for Chinese New Year. 

The pictures, taken in China's northern Hebei province, show the donkeys tethered next to strips of meat and parts of carcasses sitting on bloodstained tables or hanging from poles.

And a cut weighing around 1.5kg sells for the equivalent of £10.  

These shocking images show Chinese vendors who guarantee their customers fresh donkey meat by butchering the animals to order

Lines of donkeys were seen tethered to the roadside awaiting execution in China's Hebei province in order to be sold to customers travelling home for Chinese New Year

The animals that were killed were forced to the ground, and then as one of the men pulled the donkey's head forwards, the second belted it with the sledgehammer. 

Once unconscious, the donkeys have their throats cut with the blood being collected in plastic barrels.

Last week, photographs emerged showing a flourishing trade in roadside dog meat sales - with the animals kept alive and butchered to order from people who want to ensure they get a fresh cut.

Sales have been booming ever since people started heading back to their home towns for Chinese New Year celebrations and wanting to take a gift of fresh meat with them for friends and family.

Chinese animal rights activist Guo Li, 29, said: 'The law stipulates that animals need to be killed in a hygienic and contamination free location to make sure the meat is safe for eating. 

'Even on those grounds alone these roadside offenders should be arrested and locked up. 

'But as you can see they are carrying out this sickening trade in broad daylight with nobody doing anything.'

He added: 'They argue that in many cases people are sold meat which is not fresh and slaughtering animals live guarantees that it is.

Vendors are aiming to ensure they get the best price possible by selling the meat fresh after killing the animals in front of customers

'In addition, they argue that people know they're getting donkey meat because they can see it being cut off the bone in front of them.'

The pictures were reportedly taken in the city of Baoding and Mr Guo said similar scenes with dogs and donkeys and other animals are seen across the country, particularly at this time of year.

He said: 'There is no evidence that these animals don't have disease and in the case of the dogs they are often simply snatched off the streets and butchered to order.'

Donkey meat is regarded as a delicacy in China and fetches much higher prices than other cuts of meat.

By selling it fresh and killing the animals in front of customers, these vendors are aiming to ensure they get the best price possible.
