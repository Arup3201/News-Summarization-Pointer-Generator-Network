Lionel Messi could remarkably be honoured with a mid-match stoppage at the Santiago Bernabeu during El Clasico later this month.

Messi is just three goals from breaking Athletic Bilbao legend Telmo Zarra's record of 251 La Liga goals and could do it during the clash between Real Madrid and Barcelona on October 25.

Javier Tebas, president of Spain's professional football league, has confirmed that they are considering a tribute for Messi when he breaks the record, which may include a pause in the match in Madrid.

Telmo Zarra's tally of 251 goals has stood since 1955 but it is now inevitable that Lionel Messi will break the record.

Messi could make history before El Clasico if he scores a hat-trick in Barcelona's home match against Eibar on October 18.

If he fails to score three, then he will face the mouthwatering prospect of breaking the record at the home of Barcelona's great rivals Real Madrid. 

Spanish newspaper Mundo Deportivo contemplates the prospect of a 'Messi nightmare at the Bernabeu' with Barca midfielder Xavi saying 'it would be nice' if Tebas speaks about stopping the match.

Xavi also said: 'If it happens in the Clasico, it would be another stadium, another group of fans would easily recognize his achievements. He’s one of the greatest players ever so it would be a great opportunity for the Bernabeu to pay homage to him.’

Sport goes with the headline 'Messi threat Madrid' as it further discusses the prospect of the match between the two great rivals being stopped to pay homage to the Barcelona star. 

Tebas also features on the front page of AS after reiterating that Barcelona and Espanyol would not play in La Liga if Catalonia gains independence.

The quote reads: 'According to the Law of Sport, only one non-Spanish state's clubs can play in La Liga, ad that's Andorra.'
