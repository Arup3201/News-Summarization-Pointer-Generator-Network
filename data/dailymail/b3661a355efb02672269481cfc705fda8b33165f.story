Benefit cheats who claim millions of pounds in state handouts while living abroad face being extradited back to Britain to stand trial and possibly jail.

The Government is planning an unprecedented clampdown on the thousands of expat fraudsters who milk millions of pounds in bogus payments.

Under the new proposals it is understood British police could even travel to ‘abroad fraud’ hotspots such as Spain to bring back suspected cheats.

Britons moving abroad should notify the Government of their change of circumstances.

But investigators say expats are continuing to claim benefits. The most common scams include claiming up to £56.80 a week for Income Support and £22.89 a week Pension Credit top-ups.

Government figures estimate £79 million 
was illegally plundered from the system by Britons in foreign boltholes 
in 2011, with the money paid into their British bank accounts which can 
be accessed abroad via debit and credit cards.

A Department for Work and 
Pensions spokesman said: ‘Benefit cheats think once they are lying on 
the beach they are beyond our reach.

'But fraudulently claiming benefits while living abroad is a crime and we will investigate from Manchester to Marbella.’
