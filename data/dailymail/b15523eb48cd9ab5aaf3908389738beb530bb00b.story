In trouble: Sgt Gary Stein is facing dismissal from the Marines after saying he wouldn't follow orders from Obama

An American Marine sergeant who started a Facebook group that is openly critical of President Barack Obama is facing possible dismissal from the Corps.

Sgt Gary Stein - a Camp Pendleton Marine who started the Facebook page called Armed Forces Tea Party -Â  has been told that he is in violation of Pentagon policy barring troops from political activities.

Sgt Stein, who has been in the Corps for nine years, said he started the page to encourage fellow service members to exercise their free speech rights.

As well as posting comments saying he will not follow the unlawful orders of Obama - the commander in chief - he also criticised Defense Secretary Leon Panetta.

The Marine Corps said that Stein's commanding officer ordered a preliminary inquiry on March 8 after receiving allegations that Stein posted the political statements violating the Pentagon's directives.

'After reviewing the findings of the preliminary inquiry, the commander decided to address the allegations through administrative action,' the Corps said.

Sgt Stein said he planned to fight the charges. He had applied to extend his service, which was set to expire in a few months.

He added: 'I'm completely shocked that this is happening.'

'I've done nothing wrong. I've only stated what our oath states that I will defend the constitution and that I will not follow unlawful orders. If that's a crime, what is America coming to?'

In a statement on the Armed Forces Tea Party page this morning, he added:

'If I am guilty of anything it would be that I am American, a freedom 
loving Conservative, hell bent on defending the constitution and 
preserving Americas greatness.

Critical: The military has had a policy since the Civil War of restricting the free speech of servicemen, including criticism of the commander in chief

'I am no more the Leader of the Armed 
Forces Tea Party than any other of 18,000 members are. I just happen to 
be normal guy who started a Facebook page and who hold the Tea Party 
values close my heart and believes the Tea Party can enact real change 
in this country.'

In addition to being discharged, Sgt Stein said he would have his rank reduced to lance corporal if he is proven to be in violation.

He said he was removed from his job at the Marine Corps Recruiting Depot in San Diego yesterday and given a desk job with no access to computers.

According to Pentagon directives, military personnel in uniform cannot sponsor a political club, participate in any TV or radio program or group discussion that advocates for or against a political party, candidate or cause, or speak at any event promoting a political movement.

Defensive: Sgt Stein says he did not mean to be 
'disrespectful' but he believes Obama's policies are 'crippling this 
country'

Commissioned officers also may not use contemptuous words against senior officials, including the defense secretary or the president.

Sgt Stein was first cautioned by his superiors at Camp Pendleton in 2010, after he launched his Facebook page and criticised Obama's health care overhaul.

He volunteered to take down the page while he reviewed the rules at the request of his superiors.

He concluded he was not in violation and relaunched the page.

Last week, he said his superiors told him he could not use social media sites on government computers after he posted the message stating he would not follow the president's unlawful orders.

Stein said his statement was part of an online debate about NATO allowing U.S. troops to be tried for the Quran burnings in Afghanistan.

speaker but adds he does not 'represent the views of the United States Armed 
Forces'

In that context, he said, he was stating that he would not follow orders from the president if those orders included detaining U.S. citizens, disarming them or doing anything else that he believes would violate their constitutional rights.

Another Marine alerted his command about the statement, Sgt Stein said.

He said he respects the office of the president, but he does not agree with Obama's policies. He said he is within his rights to speak up.

The Marine Corps said Sgt Stein is allowed to express his personal opinions as long as they do not give the impression he is speaking in his official capacity as a Marine.
