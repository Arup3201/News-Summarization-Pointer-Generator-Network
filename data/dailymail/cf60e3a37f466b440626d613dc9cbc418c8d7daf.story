Tiger Woods
admitted for the first time on Wednesday he was worried about his long-term
future. Rory McIlroy came up with a risque joke about England’s football team
that will no doubt leave a few over-sensitive souls feeling outraged.

Some preview days are nothing more than
routine but that was certainly far from the case at the WGC-Cadillac
Championship. 

Let’s start with Woods and an interview
that was among the more revealing of his usually secretive career. On Sunday at
the Honda Classic he walked off the course with just five holes to complete
with a recurring back complaint.

Concern: The world No 1 is suffering with a recurring back injury with just a month to go until the Masters

The world No 1 and this
week’s defending champion is planning to play in the first round but will
do so having hit nothing but the odd chip and putt at the totally revamped
Doral.

Woods first started experiencing
spasms in his lower back last September. Back then he was curt when asked
whether there were any long-term implications but here he was more forthcoming. 

‘A bad back is something that is no joke,’ said Woods. ‘When I’ve had my
injuries over the years, it always hurt after impact. So it’s fine, the ball
has gone, it’s going to hurt like hell but I can do my job. 

‘But with the back it’s a totally different
deal, and that’s one of the things I’ve learned about this type of injury. On
Sunday I couldn’t twist and so couldn’t make a backswing and when it’s like
that there’s nothing you can do. So we’re going to have a proper look at it and
try to come up with something preventative but it’s a fact I don’t heal like I
used to do. I watch my kids bounce right back up after they fall down and I
think: ”Hey, I used to do that.”’ 

Woods came up with a nice line about meeting up
with his watching daughter Sam by the 13th green. ‘That was a very
interesting concept trying to explain to a six-year-old why you’ve just quit,’
he said.

Bouncing back: McIlroy blew a chance to win at the Honda Classic with a poor back nine last Sunday 

Tiger wasn’t the only one with problems during
that amazing final round, of course. McIlroy threw away the event with a poor
back nine but you’d never have guessed from his ebullient mood.  

As for that line about England, he
was asked whether he had ever employed a psychologist in light of England using
one. After answering the question, a broad smile spread across his
face. ’I think It’s more than a psychologist that England need,’ he said. 

In Australia in December last year, McIlroy got
in a bit of bother with the internet trolls for replying, when asked whom he
would be supporting in the forthcoming Ashes Test series: ’Anyone but England.’ 

Perhaps anticipating the Twitter reaction on this occasion,
he added: ’Please don’t print that.’  

A bit late for that given the interview was
broadcast live but it’s worth repeating: it was a joke, people.

It wasn’t his only good one, either. Some
of the $250million Donald Trump has spent on rebuilding this place has gone on
naming the refurbished blocks of villas after legends of the game. Wouldn’t you
know it, McIlroy is staying in the…Tiger Woods villa. 

‘There’s pictures all over my room of him,’ said
McIlroy, laughing. ‘I sent him a message last night saying: “I can’t get away
from you. I can’t go to the bathroom without looking at you.”’

McIlroy admitted he was disappointed with
the way he played down the stretch on Sunday. ‘I wasn’t as committed to my
shots as I should have been but there were a lot of positives to take out of
the week,’ he insisted. ‘It was my third strokeplay tournament of the year and
the third time I have been in contention so if you keep doing that you’re going
to eventually walk through the door and win, and then when you get into the
habit of it, everything becomes a bit easier.’ 

Amidst the flurry of mistakes McIlroy made
coming home there was one truly outstanding blow on the 18th. When
nothing else would do, he produced a stunning 240 yard five wood shot on that
dangerous par-five that finished just 10 feet from the flag. ‘That might be the
best shot I have ever played under pressure,’ he said. It earned him a spot in
the four man play-off but he couldn’t capitalize, with American Russell Henley
snatching first prize.  

Woods’s participation means the world’s top 50
are all present here among this elite field of 69 players. With a first prize of
a shade under £1million, any European victory will clearly have a huge bearing
on the race for places at the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles in September.
