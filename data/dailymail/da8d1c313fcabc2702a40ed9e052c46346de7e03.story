Multi-generational households are becoming increasingly popular in Britain, with almost 36 million over-18s having lived in a house containing two or three generations of adults, according to a recent report by insurance company Aviva.

But the Harland family has gone one step further. They are one of the few four-generational – or 4G – households in the country.

Mike Harland and his wife Cathy live in The Malt House, a seven-bedroom property in Crookham, outside Newbury in Berkshire, with Cathy’s mother, Ann Hayman, Mike’s son Dominic and wife Marina, and her son Michael, 12, and Dominic’s two sons, Timothy, 14, and William, eight.

The house is split down the middle, with Dominic’s family on one side and Mike and Cathy on the other, while Ann lives in a separate annexe. ‘You grow far more living together as one family,’ says Mike, 65, who co-owns the property with Dominic, 38. ‘You can do much more with the rest of the family than on your own.’

Ann, 77, says: ‘It works out very well for all of us. I look after the dogs during the day and keep things tidy and because I know when everyone’s coming home I can put something in the oven ready for when they get back.’

Sixteen years ago, Cathy, an admin manager, and Mike, a computer engineer, asked Ann to move in with them in a house in Diss, Norfolk.

The set-up proved a success but the area was less than ideal for them and they decided to make a move to Berkshire to be closer to Mike’s children and grandchildren.

‘Property prices were astronomical,’ recalls Mike. ‘So we suggested to Dominic that we consider pooling our finances and buying one big house, and he said yes.’

The hunt began for a property big enough to accommodate eight of them. The Malt House was the answer to their dreams – or at least had the potential to be. The red-brick property, built in 1850 and a former borstal, had lain derelict for years. But set in rolling countryside perfect for walking the family’s five border collies and with easy access to Aldermaston, where Dominic’s business is based, it seemed perfect.

They bought the house for £550,000 and
spent £300,000 renovating it and adding an extension. The goal was to 
create two separate homes under one roof.

The more traditional ‘west wing’, 
with its exposed beams, oak floors, rugs and large, cosy drawing room 
with wood-burning stove, belongs to Mike and Cathy.

The first floor, which in the borstal days was divided into tiny ‘cells’ for offenders, now has two guest bedrooms. The second floor – formerly empty roof space accessed via a trap door – contains a light-filled master suite, with bathroom and storage room that could be converted into a nursery.

The ‘east wing’ – which has its own front door but can be accessed through a connecting door on the first floor – is occupied by Dominic, Marina and the children. It has a younger feel, with underfloor heating, modern colours and a new kitchen with central island.

The Malt House offers slightly more than 4,000  sq ft of living space.

‘We can all disappear,’ says Ann. ‘There are enough bathrooms, so there’s no need to queue in the morning. It’s big enough not to step on one another’s toes. It’s been wonderful, as I would have been lonely living alone.’

James Dawson. of agents Jackson-Stops & Staff, says: ‘It is rare to find four generations living together – and unusual to find a property that lends itself to four generations so well.’

The Harlands’ arrangement is coming to an end because Dominic wants his own place, but Mike, Cathy and Ann hope to find somewhere to live in the same area. The house is on the market at £950,000.
