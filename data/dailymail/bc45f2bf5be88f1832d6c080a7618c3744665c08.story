A Detroit driver allegedly shot and killed a man who told him to slow down because there were children playing in the area.

Evans is accused of shooting Cleveland Dunklin, 23, on September 30 in front of his home in west Detroit.

Dunklin had seen Evans driving an SUV
at a high rate of speed in the 13900 block of Braile Street about 7pm 
and shouted at him to slow down because children were playing nearby, 
according to the Wayne County Prosecutor’s Office.

The prosecutor’s office said Evans returned to the same block about 50 minutes later and allegedly shot Dunklin.

Dunklin's devastated father, Cleveland Dunklin III, said the killing was 'senseless'.

'My boy didn't bother nobody,’ he said. ‘They had words and he went and changed cars and came back and killed my boy.’

Memorial: Balloons and a cross mark the spot where Dunklin was shot dead on September 30

A makeshift memorial of a wooden cross, balloons and candles sit outside the Braile Street home, marking the spot where he died.

The family says Dunklin IV had a job working in demolition. He was a happy homebody who looked out for his friends and family, according to Local 4 Defenders.

His sister, Shahara Horton, says her family is still trying to grasp the cruelty.

‘My two kids, all they talk about is my uncle D-house. My uncle D. That's the killer part,’ she said.

Dunklin III said: ‘All I know is I don't have a son no more. All I can do now is make arrangements to bury him properly because he is another victim that got killed for a senseless crime,’ he said.

The victim was taken to a local hospital and pronounced dead, according to the Detroit Free Press.

Evans is scheduled for a preliminary examination on Tuesday.
