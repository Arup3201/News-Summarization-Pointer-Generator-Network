Rap duo Run the Jewels's show during the SXSW festival in Austin was interrupted when an unruly fan rushed up on stage and took a swing at one of the hip-hop stars.

An unidentified man attempted to hit rapper El-P, though his bandmate Killer Mike pushed the fan off of the stage toward security.

Killer Mike was seen on video taunting the fan with expletives as security followed him into the crowd, knocking the man to the ground with a punch when it appeared he was heading back to the stage.

'Your mother should be ashamed you were born,' the rapper screamed. 

Guards are later seen fighting the man in the crowd after he got up.

Run the Jewels, who received critical praise for their second self-titled album last year, continued with their set after a break.

'Sorry for the brief interruption,' El-P said later on his Twitter account.

The rapper said that the attacker, who he called 'obviously mentally ill', had not been arrested and was let go by police.

'Its 1 thing for us and our crew, Its more dangerous for random people,' he said.

El-P called the man 'dangerous and loose' and added that he had been seen walking around SXSW talking to himself.

He said he was grateful for his 'crew' of Killer Mike and the security guards. 

Rapper El-P, a member of Run the Jewels, said that the man, who  was 'obviously mentally ill,' was not arrested by police 

The attacker was tossed from the venue by private security and Austin police did not investigate because the matter was already handled internally by the event, according to KXAN.  

Run the Jewels was performing at the Spotify House, and their show was not officially part of SXSW. 

A representative for Spotify said, 'We take security extremely seriously. (We) want to make sure we continue to use the best possible security practices for the continued safety of everyone here.'

A SXSW representative told Daily Mail Online that 'The safety of our attendees, artists, staff and volunteers is, and has always been, a top priority' and referred to the Austin Police Department.

Run the Jewels members El-P and Killer Mike continued with their Austin show after the interruption

The unidentified unruly fan was kicked out of the venue run by Spotfiy, but not arrested by the Austin Police Department
