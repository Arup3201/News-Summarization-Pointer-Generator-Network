A Dutch prince who has been in a coma ever since he suffered a ski accident eight months ago is showing 'minimal signs of consciousness'.

According to the Dutch royal family Prince Johan Friso, who is being treated at a London hospital following the ski accident in Lech, in Austria, has recently shown a slight improvement.

However, in a statement, the Dutch Royal House said 'it will take many months before there is more clarity' about the prince's chances of recovery.

It gave no further details, but urged the media 'to continue to respect the privacy of the family.'

Prince Friso, has been in a coma ever since he was buried in an avalanche during a ski outing at the resort in February.

Queen Beatrix's 44-year-old middle 
son, who gave up his right to the throne a decade ago, was skiing 
off-piste when he was caught
in an avalanche.

The accident, in which the Prince was trapped under the snow for 25 minutes before he was pulled out unconscious, attracted considerable media attention at the time.

His doctors said his brain was starved of oxygen while he was buried which resulted in a cardiac arrest that lasted 50 minutes.

He was later flown to London for 
treatment and doctors have previously said he suffered severe brain 
damage and might never come out of a coma.

The accident occurred as Prince Friso
was skiing with a childhood friend from the alpine village that the 
Dutch royal family had been visiting each winter for years.

The friend was carrying an avalanche 
'air bag' and escaped without serious injury. Friso was found after 25 
minutes with the help of a signaling device he was carrying and was 
flown by helicopter to an Innsbruck clinic.

Following the accident his
condition was at first described as 'stable but life-threatening', and the queen and his wife
came to be by his side.

At the time Stefan
Jochum, a spokesman for the 
Lech ski area where the accident occurred, said the incident 
took place as the prince and other skiers were on slopes away from
the marked Lech ski runs.

The trails were laden with snow after weeks of record 
falls.

Prince Friso, whose older brother is Crown Prince Willem-Alexander,
asked for permission in 2003 to marry Mabel Wisse Smit, Dutch media 
published details of her relationship with mobster Klaas Bruinsma, who 
was shot and killed in 1991 in front of the Amsterdam Hilton hotel.

Following the revelations, the couple decided not to get official permission for their marriage.

The couple publicly acknowledged having been 'naive and incomplete' 
during her vetting process before joining the royal family. Then-Prime 
Minister Jan Peter Balkenende signalled he could not recommend the 
marriage to parliament for approval.

They married anyway, a decision that meant Friso's removal from the line of succession.

The couple are still part of Beatrix's family and attend important royal
functions.

Mabel has been granted the title 'Princess Mabel' and Friso 
has an array of noble titles, including 'Prince of Oranje-Nassau' - but 
not 'Prince of the Netherlands'.

Prince Friso most recently worked 
as financial director at Urenco, the European uranium-enrichment 
consortium.
