Baby-faced: Morgan Halstead, 14, is banned from meeting friends in public without his parents

A 14-year-old tearaway has been banned from meeting his friends in public - unless his parents go with him.

Morgan Halstead was handed the unusual Asbo after harassing and intimidating residents for more than a year in Grantham, Lincolnshire.

The baby-faced schoolboy also caused criminal damage by throwing stones at people and property, and ignored notices banning him from shopping and leisure areas in the market town.

Grantham Magistrates' Court made the order earlier this month after an application by South Kesteven District Council.

It bans the teenager from meeting in a public place with more than two people unless he is accompanied by his mother or father.

He is barred from several areas of the town including a branch of Costcutters, a community centre, the Meres Leisure Centre and a footpath.

The order also bans him from publicly meeting five other teenagers, who cannot be named, or throwing objects towards people or property.

South Kesteven District Council operations director Ian Yates said: 'We are not going to tolerate poor behaviour of this nature in our neighbourhoods.

'We and Lincolnshire Police work in partnership with retailers and members of the public in South Kesteven to gain the evidence against these perpetrators of unacceptable behaviour.

'This young man has been responsible for 15 months of anti social behaviour on the Earlesfield estate where innocent people have been harassed and intimidated.'

One Grantham resident, Tony Billingham, 64, said: 'The kids around here have nothing to do so they just gather together after school and cause trouble.

'I have seen this kid and his gang of mates terrorising vulnerable old or disabled people and throwing things at them.

'And they cause hell for the local shops by trying to nick things and just making a mess of everything.

'He definitely deserves an Asbo but Iâ€™m not sure it will work because to someone like him it will just be seen as a badge of honour.

'Something needs to be done to give the young people something to do.'

Asbos are civil orders, but breaching them is a criminal offence.

A photo of Halstead was released so residents can report him if he causes more trouble.

Lincolnshire Police urged residents to keep an eye on Halstead.

PC Kay McManus said: 'If anyone sees a breach of these conditions set out by the court, police should be contacted on the non-emergency number 101.'
