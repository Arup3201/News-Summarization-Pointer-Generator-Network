The DNA of Ohio kidnapping suspect Ariel Castro was provided to the state crime lab yesterday afternoon and entered into a database to see if they can link the accused rapist to any more crimes.

The Bureau of Criminal Investigation lab
staff is rushing the DNA testing to provide investigators with results. The process usually takes around 22 days, but the lab can complete the testing in 24 to 48 hours if necessary.

The FBI will find out later today if there are any matches with any profiles in the database.

Cleveland schoolgirl Tammy Seals, 14, pictured left, was kidnapped and murdered in 1981. Lawyers are now investigating whether Ariel Castro, pictured right, who was this week accused of the kidnap and rape of three other Cleveland girls, was also responsible for the abduction of Ms Seals 

Since Castro has never been convicted of a crime, his DNA would not be stored in state or national databases.

Some DNA profiles in the databases are 
from unknown individuals who left behind their genetic fingerprint at a 
crime scene, such as a rape, murder or burglary, reported The Plain Dealer.

One crime that lawyers believe Castro may have responsible for is the murder of a newspaper delivery girl in the 1980s.

Orlando 'Chico' Morales was convicted
and jailed in 1981 for the kidnapping, rape and murder of Cleveland 
schoolgirl Tammy Seals.

But
Morales has always maintained his innocence and lawyers are now looking
into the possibility of whether the main suspect in the recent 
Cleveland kidnapping case may in fact be responsible for the death of 
14-year-old Ms Seals.

Now lawyers from the Ohio Public Defender's Wrongful Conviction Project, who have been working to clear Morales' name, are looking into whether Castro could also be behind the abduction of Tammy Seals. 

Wrongful Conviction Project Director Joe
Bodenhamer told Cleveland.com: 'There were so many similarities, that's
what piqued our interest.'

In prison: Orlando 'Chico Morales was found guilty by a jury of the kidnap, rape and murder of Tammy Seals but he has always maintained his innocence

The lawyers point out that while Ms Seals was kidnapped years before Castro's alleged victims, Morales was a similar age to Castro and lived in the same area when he was charged with her murder.

Ms Seals was abducted while delivering Plain Dealer newspapers and her body was found four months later in an abandoned house on Franklin Avenue near West 28th Street. She was tied up and had been sexually assaulted before being murdered.

Lawyers working on Morales case, who has already served more than 30 years in prison, claim there was no physical evidence to link Morales to the crime.

Detectives also found hairs found on Ms Seal's body which were 'dissimilar' to both those of Morales and the murdered teen.

Now with samples of Castro's DNA, they may be able to link him to the murder if he is responsible.

In 1985, two Plain Dealer reporters wrote an investigative piece looking into the case which found jurors said Morales' conviction was based mainly on the evidence of a convicted criminal who later changed his story.

Another witness later admitted to lying for reward money.

Lawyers also highlighted that hispanic Morales was featured in a lineup with all black suspects when witnessed had reported seeing two or three hispanic men chasing Ms Seals.

They also pointed out that witnesses claimed he was driving a car even though Morales couldn't drive and always used the bus for transport.

Amy Borror, a spokeswoman for the state office, told Cleveland,com: 'We have long believed in Chico's innocence, but hadn't been able to find any leads as to who the actual perpetrators may have been.

'The similarities between the details emerging (in the abduction case) and Tammy Seals' abduction and murder are striking, and have us wondering whether this might be the break in Chico's case we've been waiting for.'

Castro is currently in prison after a judge at Cleveland Municipal Court set his bond at $8 million.

Ashley Summers and, right, an 'age-progressed' rendering of her, as might would look now at 19

Ashley Summers is another missing Ohio girl whose disappearance was believed to have been linked to Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus' disappearance.

She was 14-years-old on July 6, 2007, when she was reported missing from her home in the same neighborhood where Berry and DeJesus had vanished.

Initially Ashley was considered a runaway as she had lived with her great-uncle and they had argued prior to her disappearance.

But a year later the police and FBI believed Ashley was an ‘endangered juvenile’ who could be ‘being held again her will.’

In 2009, the FBI said they suspected a link between Ashley’s disappearance and those of Berry and DeJesus.

Ashley's physical appearance and the proximity of her home to the other disappearances lead investigators to suspect the cases were linked and that all three might have been kidnapped by the same man.

Special Agent Vicki Anderson, of the FBI Cleveland Division told Cleveland.com on Tuesday that Ashley remains in their thoughts as they gather evidence at Ariel Castro's Seymore Avenue home.

‘We are keeping Ashley in our thoughts as we go every step of the way,’ she said. ‘Whether it is something we find at the house, or someone seeing the stories remembers something, we continue our search for Ashley.’

Ashley Summers was 14 years old when she was 
reported missing in 2007 from her home in the same neighborhood where 
Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus had vanished

A cadaver dog, along with various law enforcement officers, searched Ariel Castro's Cleveland home on Tuesday, said Anderson. It was not clear why a cadaver dog might be needed, or if it found anything amiss.

Prior to the disclosure of the naming of the women discovered on Monday, Summers’ family had briefly thought their daughter could be amongst those discovered.

'We're hoping that it's connected, and they knew where she was,' her aunt Debra Summers told CNN. 'We're hoping for a miracle.'

The Summers family is renewing their efforts to publicize Ashley's disappearance.

The FBI's missing person website says Ashley Summers has a tattoo of 'Gene' enclosed in a heart on her upper arm, and her birthday is June 16, 1993, making her 19 years old.

Investigators will speak to Gina DeJesus, Amanda Berry and Michelle Knight to see if they know anything about Summers' disappearance.
