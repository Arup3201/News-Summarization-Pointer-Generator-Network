Tennis stars Eugenie Bouchard and Heather Watson celebrated the start of the 2015 Hopman Cup on Saturday night at the annual ball in Perth.

The yearly tournament is officially opened with a black tie evening at a plush Perth hotel, and this year was no different as some of tennis's star names dressed up to the nines.

Bouchard and Watson posed for a photo during the event, which the latter posted to her Instagram account shortly after.

The Hopman Cup involves eight countries battling it out in two groups, before the final stages sees one country crowned champion. 

Watson, who is partnering Andy Murray to represent Great Britain, had a mixed start to the competition, losing 6-2, 6-2 against last year's female champion Alize Cornet, before teaming up with Murray to dispatch the French in a Mixed Double's match.

Bouchard, representing Canada, got off to a disastrous start, losing against the Czech Republic's Lucie Safarova 6-0, 6-4, before being defeated in the Mixed Doubles with partner Vasek Pospisil.

Watson will lead Great Britain's Fed Cup team at next month's Europe/Africa Zone Group I tournament in Budapest.

Watson, Johanna Konta and doubles team Jocelyn Rae and Anna Smith complete the line-up named by Judy Murray for the round-robin event, which takes place from February 4-7.

Britain are still without Laura Robson, who will not make her return to action until next month after a year out with left wrist problems.

Murray's side will play three group matches, with the winners going forward to a play-off and the winners of that playing off in April for a place in World Group II.

Bouchard did not fare well in her first two matches at the tournament, losing both to Czech opposition
