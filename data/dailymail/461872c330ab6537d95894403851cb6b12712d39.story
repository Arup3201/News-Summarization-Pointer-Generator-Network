A probation officer could be in trouble with bosses after he failed to get permission to appear on a TV show - where he has sex in a box.

Des Lashimba, a probation officer based at Manchester Magistrates’ Court, took part in the Channel 4 show Sex Box with partner Lynette Ellis.

He could now face disciplinary action as he did not ask bosses’ permission to take part - and promotional material made it clear he worked as a probation officer.

Trouble ahead: Manchester probation officer Des Lashimba, 41, right, could find himself in hot water after his bosses found out about his appearance on Sex Box, a new Channel 4 show airing this Monday, on which he has sex with partner Lynette Ellis, left

Bosses at Greater Manchester Probation Trust will watch the show, being broadcast on Monday night, to see if it has an impact on the reputation of the probation service.

In the show couples have 35 minutes to have sex in a large box on stage. They then discuss the act afterwards with presenter Mariella Frostrup and a panel of experts in front of a studio audience.

The audience do not see the couples having sex in the box. Channel 4 has billed the show as ‘a sex talk show with a difference’.

Channel 4 has defended the controversial new show, which airs on Monday and will feature three couples having sex in an opaque box before discussing the act with a studio panel.

It forms part of the channel's Real Sex season.

Channel 4's head of factual programming Ralph Lee told MailOnline: 'The idea of the box is that it will facilitate a conversation that's more immediate, more honest and more truthful than if we didn't have it.

'It's not about the technicalities of sex but more about discussing what it means to them as a couple.

'There has been a massive explosion of pornography but what there hasn't been is a conversation about real sex in people's lives today.

'This will add context to pornography.'

Colleagues at the Probation Trust are also understood to feel the show is an embarrassment - as Mr Lashimba is seen as ‘the face’ of the probation service at Manchester Magistrates Court.

When approached Mr Lashimba, 41, who lives in Manchester, declined to comment.

But in promotional material his partner Ms Ellis, 39, insisted they are not exhibitionists, adding: 'Des was terrified he wouldn’t be able to do what was needed. But I wore some sexy underwear and that seemed to do the trick.

'We have sex as part of a normal, healthy and loving relationship. I hope people will look at the programme in a positive light.'

Part of Channel 4’s Campaign for Real Sex season, Sex Box is described by the channel as ‘a panel discussion about the real sex lives of people’.

Bosses at Greater Manchester Probation Trust say they have yet to see the programme and will review whether Mr Lashimba has breached employee guidelines after it is shown.

A spokesman said: 'We did not know a GMPT employee was going to be appearing in the programme. As we have not seen the programme, we don’t yet know if it will have a reputational impact on either the Trust or on the employee, and we will review the situation after it has been televised.

'In the meantime, no disciplinary action has been taken against the employee.'
