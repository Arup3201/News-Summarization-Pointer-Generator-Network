Before Sydney siege Man Haron Monis came to Australia he had a life of wealth and success in Iran.

The self-styled sheikh was deliberate about making connections that would benefit him, marrying into a family who were closely tied to high-profile members of the Iranian Islamic Revolution.

'He was a powerful man, a very important man in Iran,' said the former friend of Monis.

'Anything he wanted, he could have.'

A member of the Muslim community has revealed that Sydney siege Man Haron Monis came to Australia after living a life of wealth and success in Iran

The man said that when he had heard about the Sydney siege, during which Monis and two of his captives, Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson, lost their lives, he asked himself "What idiot could do this?".

'This person who did this, it wasn't the person I knew.' 

Monis' former friend said that the gunman's life transformed when he fled Iran in 1996, leaving behind a circle of elite connections and wealthy friends.

Born Manteghi Bourjerdi, and raised in a religious family and given the opportunity to study at the most exclusive university in Tehran, Monis quickly made a name for himself as a successful and prominent figure in the city.

'In Iran, Man was one of those people who everybody wants to be around, because he had connections and he was successful,' his friend told The Sydney Morning Herald. 

'I would go to Man's house and see photos of him with famous people, with military people, with generals'.

Living in a privileged neighbourhood, Monis established himself as a savvy businessman through the connections he had made at university and through his marriage.

While Monis ran a travel agency, among other small companies, his main enterprise capitalised on the black market in Iran, selling television sets he was able to obtain cheaply through his government contacts.

The radical Islamist studied the Koran and published a collections of poems called 'Daroon and Boroon' (Inside and Outside), which made him famous among the Iranian literary scene and encouraged his radical notions.

His poems references 'the flame of hell', and 'wise drunks', as well as claiming that his literary skill was beyond the comprehension of most readers.

Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the hostage-taker, who at one point during last week's Sydney unfurled an Islamic flag at the window of the cafe, 'had a long history of violent crime history of violent crime, infatuation with extremism and mental instability'. 

Monis' friend said that the gunman was a very private individual, which remained an aspect of his life when he left his wife and two daughters in Iran and sought refugee status in Australia in 1996.

Monis allegedly kept his marriage to Noleen Pal a 'secret', and hid his work as a spiritual healer, a role which he allegedly exploited to abuse young girls. 

He told Australian authorities that he had been employed by the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security, reported The Sydney Morning Herald, a claim which his friend said he was inclined to believe.

Monis said he had witnessed the operating procedures of the Iranian government's terrorist actions and torture inflicted upon captives.

After being charged in 2013 with being an accessory before and after the fact of his ex-wife's murder, he withdrew from public life, becoming a 'ghost'.

Ms Pal was lured to the Werrington apartment block in western Sydney where Monis was living in April last year and allegedly doused with accelerant, set alight and then stabbed 18 times by Droudis.

At the time, Monis and Ms Pal were involved in a bitter custody battle over their two young sons. 

Monis' website, now taken down by the government, claimed that the children he had with his wife Noreen Pal had been taken away from him by the Australian government, and that he had been 'continuously been under attack & false accusation by the Australian government & media'.  

Monis was investigated in 2007 and 2008 for sending vile hate letters to the families of Australian soldiers killed by insurgents in Afghanistan, branding their children 'Nazis'. 

In April this year, he was arrested by Sydney's sex crimes squad detectives and charged with the 2002 indecent and sexual assault of a woman in the west of the city.

During a court appearance at Penrith in October he was charged with an additional 40 indecent and sexual assault charges.
