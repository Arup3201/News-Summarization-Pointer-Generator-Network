With his black notebook in hand, Alan Pardew started the task of reshaping Crystal Palace during their 2-1 victory over Tottenham on Saturday.

This has been his first full week working with his new charges since replacing Neil Warnock in charge.

So what were the first noticeable signs of change from the Warnock regime?

Possession

Following the FA Cup win over Dover last week, Pardew promised his team will take risks with the ball. 

They certainly lived up to that billing yesterday, keeping the ball on the deck; looking to play their way out of their defensive third rather than clearing their lines as was often the case under Warnock. 

One passage of play in the 14th minute in particular showed clear signs of Pardew's influence. The long-ball remains an option, but the instructions to keep the ball were fully apparent.

Barry Bannan

The diminutive Scot was a peripheral figure under Warnock and Tony Pulis. But the playmaker has started both of Pardew's games at Palace and looks like he's being reintegrated into the club's first-team plans. 

That, of course, could change when Mile Jedinak returns from international duty, but for now the former Aston Villa man is back in the game. He was substituted, having been booked in the first-half, and Spurs took the lead just four minutes later.

Versatility in attacking

Warnock's Palace was based on getting the ball wide to the likes of Yannick Bolasie, Jason Puncheon or Wilfried Zaha, relying on their pace to get behind opposition. 

There was still an element of that under Pardew, but without Bolasie, who is on Africa Cup of Nations duty, Palace explored alternative avenues of attack. 

There was crisper passing in front of the Tottenham back-four, the way they carved open the Spurs back-line for Glenn Murray's excellent chance in the 35th minute was testament to that. It doesn't look as if Palace will be one trick ponies under Pardew.
