Critics of Floyd Mayweather say that 'Father Time' may be catching up with the WBA and WBC welterweight world champion and on some new video evidence they may be right.

However, for fight fans looking forward to his upcoming bout against Manny Pacquiao on May 2 - they need not worry.

And that's because footage of the 38-year-old running has been slowed down for a visual effect.
