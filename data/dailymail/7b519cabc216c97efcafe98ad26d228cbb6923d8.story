That's your transfer news for today. Join us again tomorrow from 9pm for more deals, news and rumours. 

So, Jose Mourinho claims Andre Schurrle missed today's shock defeat to Bradford through injury - not because he is set to leave the club. 

We will leave you to decide whether you believe him or not...

According to Sky Sports, Chelsea and Fiorentina are still in talks over a £26m move for Colombian winger Juan Cuadrado.

The problem seems to be that Chelsea don't want to pay the winger's release clause but the Italians won't budge. So, who will blink first?

Sampdoria coach Sinisa Mihajlovic says Samuel Eto'o is set to join the club but has told his players not to be distracted by the Everton forward's arrival.

Eto'o is in Rome for a medical and is due to be presented to the crowd before Sunday's Serie A match at home to Palermo.

Mihajlovic said: 'Eto'o is joining this team but he must not be a distraction.

'He's a great player, who has won everything and that attracts a lot of attention from the media, but this should not distract us.'

Tottenham have been linked with a move for PSG midfielder Adrien Rabiot, but his manager Laurent Blanc wants to keep him in France. 

John Brayford has joined Sheffield United on a three-and-a-half-year contract for a fee believed to be £1.5m, reports Sportsmail's Riath Al-Samarrai.

Spanish journalist Kike Marin says Arsenal and Villarreal have agreed a fee of 18million euros (£13.45m) for Gabriel Paulista, who is travelling to London - presumably to complete the paperwork and a medical. 

So, have Arsenal finally got their man? Stay tuned for the latest update. 

Andre Schurrle has been left out of Chelsea's squad for their FA Cup tie with Bradford, sparking speculation that he could be on his way out of Stamford Bridge.

Jose Mourinho said on Friday that the midfielder would play in today's game, but also admitted he would sell if a 'phenomenal' offer was made for the 24-year-old. 

Joel Campbell did not train with his Arsenal team-mates on Saturday, fueling speculation he is set to leave the club and join Real Sociedad. 

Real Sociedad want the 22-year-old Campbell either on loan or in an £8million permanent deal.

Villarreal, Benfica, Inter Milan, Swansea City and West Bromwich Albion are also interested but are waiting to hear if Arsenal are ready to let him leave.

Reports flying around that Paris Saint-Germain striker Ezequiel Lavezzi has been told he can leave Paris Saint-Germain this month.

The striker failed to show up for a training camp in Morocco and now boss Laurent Blanc has reportedly had enough and wants to sell the 29-year-old.  

Brendan Rodgers is reportedly keen on Lavezzi as he looks to boost his options upfront.

Real Madrid have already signed 16-year-old wonderkid Martin Odegaard and now, according to Gazzetta dello Sport, they are after another young star in AC Milan's Hachim Mastour. 

Mastour has also been linked with Manchester United and is being closely watched by Real. 

Barcelona defender Dani Alves has been continually linked with a move away from the Nou Camp and reports in Spain suggest Manchester United are confident of signing him. 

Sportsmail reported earlier this month that Alves was in talks about extending his contract which runs out at the end of the season, but it seems progress has been slow and United are ready to pounce. 

This may not be the last we have heard of this one...

It has been claimed that Newcastle United striker Papiss Cisse has been offered a staggering contract by Sven Goran Eriksson's side, which would make him one of the best paid players in the world.

Cisse has 18 months left on his deal at Newcastle and the club would reportedly be willing to sell him for a fee in the region of £8million - rather than risk losing him on a free. 

Cisse's total package - £150,000 a week for three years - could see the 29-year-old earn an incredible £22.5m should he move to China. 

Paul Pogba will not be leaving Juventus in the January transfer, according to agent Mino Raiola.

The 21-year-old is reportedly wanted by the likes of Chelsea, Real Madrid and former club Manchester United but looks set to remain in Turin until at least the end of the season having only recently signed a five-year deal with the Serie A champions.

Reports this morning suggest that West Ham midfielder Ravel Morrison is set to join Serie A club Lazio on a free transfer this summer - as first reported by Sportsmail last week. 

He has reportedly agreed a deal with the Italians but not signed an official contract just yet.

Sportsmail understands that a team of agents flew to Rome two weeks ago to discuss the move. 

Radamel Falcao endured another frustrating night for Manchester United against Cambridge United, and his agent Jorge Mendes has a theory as to why the striker is struggling. 

Mendes claims his client would be better if Sir Alex Ferguson was still United manager, rather than Louis van Gaal. 

Cruzeiro manager Marcelo Oliveira says Real Madrid have signed a technically gifted player in midfielder Lucas Silva. 

Oliveira has backed the 21-year-old to be a success at the Bernabeu following his £11.5m move. 

He said: 'I have been behind him when he has shot from outside the area and believe me he has a lot of potential that can be further exploited.'

Cristiano Ronaldo was close to joining Arsenal in 2003 but the club didn't have the money to complete the deal because they were building the Emirates Stadium.

Instead, Ronaldo joined United in a £12m deal and, as they say, the rest is history...

Steven Gerrard may be leaving Liverpool for La Galaxy in the summer, but Brendan Rodgers says he wants to keep the rest of his senior stars at Anfield. 

Kolo Toure (33), Glen Johnson (30) and Brad Jones (32) are in the final six months of their deals, while Martin Skrtel (30) has 18 months left on his contract and Lucas Leiva has been linked with a move to Inter Milan. 

But Brendan Rodgers wants them to stay as he plans to mount a title challenge next season. 

Reports in Italy suggest that Inter Milan are lining up a £7m summer move for Yaya Toure.

The 32-year-old has had a rocky relationship with Manchester City in the last 18 months - accusing the club of disrespecting him by not celebrating his birthday. 

And Gazzetta dello Sport claim the midfielder would be happy to join up with former boss Mancini in the summer. 

Real Madrid have reached a deal to sign midfielder Lucas Silva from Brazilian club Cruzeiro on a long-term contract.

Madrid said on Friday that Silva has signed a contract tying him to the European champions until June 30, 2020. 

Silva had been linked with a move to Arsenal, but instead opted to join the Spanish club rather than the Premier League.

Arsenal appear to have received a boost in the race to sign Gabriel Paulista in January as Villarreal left the £15million-rated defender out of their squad to face Levante at the weekend.

Villarreal announced the 18-man squad to face Levante at El Madrigal and listed the players who would miss the match through injury or suspension.

However Paulista's name was left off the official club announcement altogether, which suggests he has moved a step closer to leaving the Spanish outfit.
