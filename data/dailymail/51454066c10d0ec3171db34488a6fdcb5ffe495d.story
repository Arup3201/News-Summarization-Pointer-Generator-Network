Wayne Rooney's best days are way behind him and Manchester United must look for a new captain, according to Stan Collymore.

The pundit, formerly a striker with Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, believes the Red Devils frontman is past his best despite Rooney's recent claims that fans are yet to see the  him hit the top form of his career.

Speaking to Bleacher Report, Collymore said: 'I think the best of Wayne Rooney unfortunately we've seen. That's natural, he's got a lot of miles on the clock. He came into the English game at 17, he's now (nearly) 29.

'For Wayne Rooney, I think his best years were probably playing alongside Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez. 

'Do you not think that Wayne Rooney will ever get to 30 League goals, 25 goals again? I don't think so.  

'Do I think the best is yet to come for Wayne Rooney? No not at all. I think that was three years ago, Collymore added. 'That doesn't mean to say that he can't be productive over the next two or three seasons because let's not forget he's a multiple Premier League winner, he's a Champions League winner, he's approaching 100 caps for England and is a very,very experienced and useful man to have in and around your team and your squad.'

The 43-year-old also claimed Rooney isn't a natural athlete and compared the frontman to Real Madrid stars Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo, saying: 'He's not a natural athlete. If you were to put Wayne Rooney just in his underpants alongside Gareth Bale in his underpants, or Cristiano Ronaldo, you'd see the evolution of a professional footballer in terms of the physique.'

Rooney, who celebrated ten years at Old Trafford last month, was handed the captain's armband by new manager Louis van Gaal at the start of the season.

However, when asked whether Rooney deserves to skipper Man United, Collymore said: 'I don't think Wayne Rooney or his representation have represented the best of Manchester United over the last four or five years.'

'For me, it would be a David De Gea, you very rarely hear anything of him other than being a very good goalkeeper.'

'Maybe Daley Blind could grow into the role but there are two things here: Should Wayne Rooney be thrown under the bus for being sent off? No, not really. Five years is a long time between sendings off. Should he be captain of Manchester United? No, I think Louis van Gaal should be looking elsewhere for the longer term.'
