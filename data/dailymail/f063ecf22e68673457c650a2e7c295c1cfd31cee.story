In demand: BlackBerry handsets are very popular with teenagers but now the company behind the brand is being asked to explain why people are able to download illegal content

BlackBerry has been ordered to a summit meeting with Ofcom to explain why children are still able to download pornography on its phones.

Young people are able to download pornography through the popular handset even if their phone operator has installed a filter because data flows through the BlackBerry’s own server.

Research In Motion, the company behind the BlackBerry, will be joined by other leading phone networks at the meeting called by the telecommunications regulator.

An Ofcom spokesman told The Telegraph: ‘It was brought to our attention that there is a problem. It is to do with the way the operating system works. We are very concerned and want to get this resolved as quickly as possible.’

Mobile phone networks have been able to apply filters to other handsets, such as the iPhone, but because of data flows through the BlackBerry’s own services leading operators have been unable to block pornography on the popular phone.

The phone is hugely popular with teenagers, mainly because of its BlackBerry messenger service, many of its of its eight million users are believed to be under 18.

Tory MP Claire Perry, for Devizes,has said she is so alarmed at children having access to pornography she has vowed to raise the issue in parliament.

Filter: Research In Motion has denied it asked mobile operators to pay for a pornographic block on handsets

It is the second blow to the company's reputation as this summer BlackBerry executives were hauled before MPs to explain how their service came to be so popular with rioters trying to dodge police.

Barring certain sites is standard procedure in the phone industry, which prides itself on its success with this form of self-regulation.

But mobile phone networks previously told Financial Mail that RIM demanded they pay to have bars installed on their customers’ BlackBerrys, something that is not standard practice.

Only T-Mobile is believed to have had a bar in place for BlackBerry users.

RIM, though, said this was not so, that it had never demanded money for installing the blocking software and referred questions on the issue back to the networks.
