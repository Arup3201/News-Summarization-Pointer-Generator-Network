Authorities in Northern California announced Thursday the arrest of a suspect in the killing of a beloved Catholic priest who was found dead in a church rectory.

A statement released by Eureka police says 43-year-old Gary Lee Bullock, of Redway, was taken into custody earlier today by Humboldt County deputies in the killing of the Rev. Eric Freed.

Bullock had been named in an arrest warrant. The statement says he had been in and out of police custody in the hours before Freed died.

Freed's body was found by staff Wednesday in the St. Bernard Church rectory after he failed to show up for morning Mass, leaving the parish in shock.

Rev. Freed, 56, was the only pastor in St Bernard Church, and had been working in the parish for three years.

Bullock has a criminal history that includes a conviction for cocaine possession last year, Redwood Times reported.

According to a press release from the Eureka Police Department, Bullock was first spotted in the Garberville area of Humboldt County and arrested for public intoxication on New Year’s Eve.

He was taken to jail, but was 'rejected' due to his erratic behavior.

The 43-year-old man was then transferred to a hospital for evaluation, where he became more agitated and had to be physically restrained. He was eventually booked into jail just after 4.30pm Tuesday.

He was released after midnight on New Year's Day. About two hours later, police officers responded to 615 H Street after getting a 911 call about a suspicious person, who turned out to be Bullock.

The 43-year-old, however, was no longer intoxicated, and so he was referred to an emergency shelter for the night.

Some time later, a security guard heard noises near St Bernard Church and came upon a person matching Bullock's description. After a brief conversation, the guard told the man to leave.

Father Freed's body was discovered in the rectory at around 9am. Police say the cleric suffered 'significant blunt force trauma' following a violent struggle with his assailant. The murder weapon was recovered at the scene. 

An autopsy will be performed later to determine the victim’s exact cause of death.

Eureka Mayor Frank Jager said Freed was a personal friend and a ‘tremendous person in this community.’ 

Days before his death, Rev. Freed sent his parishioners a message of thanks, wishing them happy holidays.

‘I cannot tell you how proud and honored I am to be your pastor,’ Freed wrote on the parish website.

‘Our parish is alive, joyful and full of faith, hope and charity that define us as Catholic Christians.’

Loved: Pastor Freed had been working in Eureka for three years, and had previously taught religious studies at a nearby California State University

Motive: Detectives are still trying to determine what prompted the suspect to kill the beloved cleric

Before arriving in Eureka, Rev. Freed taught religious studies at Humboldt University in nearby Arcata for over a decade and spent 'many years' in Japan.

He was also actively involved with the Catholic student 
group Newman Center on campus.

'He was a really, genuinely warm individual," Professor Stephen Cunha, chairman of Humboldt University's religious studies department told CNN.

‘This was not some stuffy clergyman. He was very much someone that you could sit down and speak with.

‘He connected with everybody.’

Investigation: Eureka Police Chief Andy Mills say police still have no solid leads in the investigation into the killing of Rev. Freed
