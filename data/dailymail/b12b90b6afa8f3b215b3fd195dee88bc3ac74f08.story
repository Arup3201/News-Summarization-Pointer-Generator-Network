A make-up-only studio in Manhattan's SoHo is taking grooming-on-the-go to new heights.

For $50, Pucker, which aims to be the blow dry bar of make-up, gives women the opportunity to have their face done professionally without the overbearing atmosphere of a department store.

'Right now the only options women have is
 hiring a make-up artist to come to their house for $150 an hour, or a 
department store where it's hit or miss,' co-founder Julio Sandino told MailOnline. 'Usually they're 
better sales people than make-up artists, because they're 
trying to push products on you.'

For $50, New York-based Pucker takes women from bare-faced to glam in 30 minutes -- without the overbearing atmosphere of a department store (pictured: the reporter before and after visiting Pucker)

Pucker has the appearance of a hair salon (there are eight spacious and hand-crafted make-up stations) with the atmosphere of your wealthy best friend's loft apartment.

A cozy waiting area at the back of the store offers a space 'where women can come and 
hang out with their friends, have cocktails and eat chocolate,' said Mr Sandino's partner in Pucker, co-founder Hiyam McKelvey.

'Or it can be for the gentleman who's
 waiting for their significant other!' chimed in Mr Sandino, a celebrity make-up artist who has worked with Angelina Jolie, Tilda Swinton and on runway and advertising jobs for the likes of Marc Jacobs, Dolce & Gabbana and Versace.

'When Hiyam presented the idea to me I 
thought it was an incredible idea.  Me being in the business for 21 
years, I knew exactly who to go to when I hired the Pucker make-up artists, people I have 
worked with for years on fashion shoots and runway shows.'

Mrs McKelvey, who is married to entrepreneur and WeWork founder Miguel McKelvey, was a stay-at-home mom who, 18 months ago, needed to
 get her make-up done for an event.

'I hadn't really been that social and
 I wanted to look as good as I could, but didn't really want to 
deal with a department store and the awkwardness and the 
pushiness associated with that,' she explained.

'I heard about Julio through a mutual 
friend and I just knew he was the one to help me with this event. Not 
only did we connect in a million different ways, but I had never 
felt as beautiful and glamorous in my life. And I thought, I need to get
 this out to everyone -- at an accessible price point.'

It took eight months to take Pucker from concept to the store's opening on February 1st. In another eight months, Pucker will open its second store in the Financial District. 'We decided to really go for it in 
October,' said Mrs McKelvey. 'We came to my husband with the idea 
and he helped us get it off the ground really quickly.'

Later this year Pucker will open its second store in the Financial District (pictured: Mr Sandino applying primer to a customer's face before he gets to work on her make-up)

A cozy waiting area was built at the back of the store 'where women can come and hang out with their friends, have cocktails and eat chocolate,' said Mr Sandino's partner in Pucker, co-founder Hiyam McKelvey

The make-up itself takes between 45 minutes to an hour, but Pucker can have you in and out in 30 minutes for those in a rush, 'and that includes putting on natural lashes,' explained Mrs KcKelvey

Downstairs, Pucker has four dressing rooms, a shower with fresh towels and robes, storage lockers and an area to touch up hair, complete with straightening irons, curlers and hairspray; all of which are complimentary with a make-up appointment.

'Everyone knows how hard it is to get ready in 
your office bathroom,' said Mrs McKelvey. 'We've all been the bag lady. So here you can store your bag; and for a small fee we can send a messenger to deliver it 
the next day or you can just pick it up.

'Basically you can go 
downstairs, put on your dress, store your stuff, get your make-up done 
and go.'

The make-up itself takes between 45 minutes to an hour, but Pucker can have you in and out in 30 minutes for those in a rush, 'and that includes putting on natural lashes,' explained Mrs KcKelvey.

Pucker offers six standard make-up looks that can be customized to your own needs and preferences

Pucker uses its own line of paraben and allergen free make-up, which Mr Sandino and Mrs McKelvey made in collaboration with a cosmetics manufacturer in Long Island, New York; but unlike department stores, only the lipsticks and lip glosses are available for purchase.

'It's great if a 
woman wants to take the color with them to touch up, which just feels 
natural,' said Mr Sandino.

For those who want to show off their new look on social media, Pucker set up a selfie station -- a private curtain-enclosed room with professional lights -- for the sole purpose of Instagram sharing. So get ready to pucker-up.
