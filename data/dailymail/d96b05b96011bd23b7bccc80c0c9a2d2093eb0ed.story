Three bus drivers in Paraguay have had their hands nailed to a cross as part of a hunger strike after they 'unjustly' lost their jobs.

Elvio Cristaldo and Eligio Martinez decided to crucify themselves in San Lorenzo, a suburb of the capital city Asunción, after they were sacked for refusing to work fewer hours.

Clemente Lovera has even had his mouth sewn shut and is  starving himself until he is allowed to return to his position.

 Lovera, 29, lies still, his lips sewn together with wire and his hands 
nailed to a wooden cross. The father-of-two is being force-fed liquid 
food through a straw

The 
father-of-two is being force-fed liquid food through a straw as he lies 
alongside his two former colleagues during the gruesome demonstration.

Mr Cristaldo, 39, told the Spanish news site Radio Interneconomia: 'I'm holding on, but it hurts a lot.'  

The trio are in a tent near the headquarters of the National Transportation Paraguay (Dinatran).

Reports claim they are being given medication to help ease the pain.

In
 August last year, eight bus drivers took part in a similar protest 
against their firing. Each of them were nailed to a cross for 20 
days near a bus terminal at Luque, 12km outside the capital Asuncion.

Each protester was positioned next to an empty coffin and all have vowed to continue until they are given their jobs back.

It
 is understood that the drivers are paid for every journey they take. 
The number of trips have been cut, which means there is less of an 
opportunity to work.
