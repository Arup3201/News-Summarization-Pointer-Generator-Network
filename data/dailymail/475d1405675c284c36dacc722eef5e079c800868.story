I was at Old Trafford on Saturday to see Manchester United comfortably beat Leicester City 3-1 and one of the standout players was Luke Shaw.

It occurred to me that this guy has every chance of going on to be a Manchester United legend over the next 15 to 20 years. But could he end up being United’s best ever left back, overtaking Denis Irwin, much loved by United die-hards, much underrated outside of the club?

That’s a tough ask given the amount of success Irwin enjoyed  - he remains United’s second most decorated player behind Ryan Giggs. He was a rare breed, as sound defensively as he was going forward, and I see both those qualities in Shaw.

The England international was full of running on Saturday... now he needs a long-term run of fitness

It’s hard to believe he is still only a teenager. But at just 19 he has the time to play more games than the 529 Irwin appeared in, and even more than the 602 made by another celebrated United full back, Gary Neville.

There are just two things missing from Shaw’s game right now, and one of them – a long-term consistent run of fitness – could hold him back for club and country.

Shaw heard Louis van Gaal’s public criticism of his fitness levels earlier in the season and admitted the United manager was right. On Saturday Shaw played the full 90 minutes, and gave an energetic display up and down the left flank no problem. He seems to have learned his lesson, after declaring he needed to achieve a far greater level of fitness at United than he had at Southampton. 

But he has picked up a few niggling injuries this season, keeping him out of action on three occasions. It could just be bad luck of course, but he’ll be keen to cut those spells on the sidelines down.

Irwin played more than 500 games for United, and was a favourite among the club's supporters 

Physically he’s on the way to being a beast, and his ability is obvious. Some have questioned his defensive strength – he makes mistakes like all defenders, but not a significantly high number of errors, his tackling generally looks effective, and his reading of opponents seems sound.

The other area lacking in his game is goals. In 79 first-team appearances with Southampton and United, he has yet to register a goal, and from what I’ve seen he’s not even looked like scoring.

Goals are not Shaw’s priority of course, and he shouldn’t be judged as a good or bad player based on the amount of goals he scores. But Irwin weighed in with a few, endearing him still more to the Old Trafford faithful.

I like Shaw a lot, and I suspect United fans already realise they have a quality player on their hands. If he applies himself, and stays fit, he’s set to be United’s left back – and probably England’s left back – for many years to come.

It’s not easy becoming a Manchester United legend, but Shaw has that opportunity right in front of him.
