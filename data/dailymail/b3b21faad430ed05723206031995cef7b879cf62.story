A flyer advertising 80p drinks at Electric in Birmingham

Nightclub promoters have been branded 'utterly irresponsible' for advertising an event which offered drinks at just 80p each.

Organisers had planned to sell cut-priced drinks at Electric in Birmingham, to coincide with the end of students exams.

Online flyers boasted that the 'Twisted Monday' event would be 'Birmingham's Biggest Monday Night.'

Former Health Minister Gisela Stuart, Labour MP for Edgbaston, said: 'It's utterly irresponsible, encouraging cheap heavy drinking on a Monday night.

'There's quite enough problems with overloaded A&Es. We don't need it on a Monday night with people getting drunk on cheap alcohol.

'We are increasingly coming to the point that responsible organisations already know that offering alcohol as a loss leader is irresponsible behaviour. It encourages quick, fast consumption of large amounts of alcohol.'

Debbie Bannigan, chief executive of alcohol charity Swanswell, said: 'It is not just about the consumer taking responsibility. It is also up to clubs, pubs, and bars to sell alcohol responsibly, and play their part in minimising harm.'

Katherine Brown, director of the Institute of Alcohol Studies said: 'We know that increased availability of cheap alcohol is fuelling problems up and down the country and it is often our hard working public servants having to mop up the mess.'

In online advertising revellers were told that tickets would be priced at £4.

A spokesman for Birmingham City Council, who are responsible for licensing, said the event did not appear to contravene Home Office guidelines on responsible drinking. 

Following widespread criticism the night, which was due to take place on February 2, has been axed. 

Before it was scrapped Ray Mohamed, a freelance promoter for GLM, who were marketing it, claimed the club would not allow irresponsible drinking.

 'If the bar staff see that people are overly wasted, the staff would say we can't serve you anymore,' he said. 

'It's up to a certain time for the 80p ones, so it's just some offer for us to pull people into the club.'

Electric manager Amo Taib denied the event had been cancelled because of  irresponsible pricing concerns but admitted that it was 'not cost-effective'.

He said promoters had 'jumped the bandwagon' and started advertising the night before it had been confirmed. 

'As a company and as a club it's not something I wanted to do,' he said. 'It was only ever in talks.' 

Promoters GLM were not immediately available for comment.
