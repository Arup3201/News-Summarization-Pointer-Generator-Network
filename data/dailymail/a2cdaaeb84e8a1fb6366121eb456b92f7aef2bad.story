Being a Bridesmaid, especially for your sister, should be one of the proudest days of your life and certainly not one of the most embarrassing.

But for mother-of-three, Martha Gudgeon, it was the latter scenario that turned out to be the case.

In fact, Martha, 32, from Westbury-sub-Mendip, Somerset was left very red-faced after she put so much weight on before her sister's wedding that she split her bridesmaid's dress just before the ceremony.

She tipped the scales at 14st 5lbs when she squeezed into her outfit for her sibling's big day and was

was then shamed into losing five stone.

Martha
 had previously avoided being a bridesmaid for her other two sisters 
because of her size but relented when she realised it was her last 
opportunity.

Then size 18, she had ordered a dress one size too small in the hope she could lose enough weight for the wedding.

But instead she managed to pile on the pounds and rip the dress just minutes before the ceremony.Embarrassed Martha was forced to fashion a bow to tie around the middle to hide her modesty as she walked with her sister down the aisle.

The extremely humiliating experience spurred her on to join her local Slimming World group and has now dropped to a very svelte 9st 5lbs and a trim size 10.

Martha explained: 'I tried to lose weight before the big day but obviously it didn't work.

'I had managed to lose a bit but just before the wedding I put on around half a stone because of what I was eating.

'When I put on the dress to go to church it split and my sister had to make a bow really quickly to hide the back of it.

'It was not one of my best moments and I was really embarrassed and just felt really stupid.

'I thought if I got the next size down it would spur me to lose weight, but I think I was in a little bit of denial.

'It was just horrible, one of my lowest points, but it kick-started me into losing weight for good.'

Martha first began piling on the weight eight-years-ago after the birth of her first child Ashton.

She developed 'quick and convenient' eating habits which saw her snack on takeaways, Greggs pasties, supermarket sandwiches and McDonalds.

'I never really cooked and would eat anything and everything that was easy and could be grabbed on the go,' she added.

'I just lived off rubbish easy convenient foods really.'

She then fell pregnant once more with Arabella, now six.

Despite her best efforts Martha's weight continued to fluctuate, and when her sister Jessica asked her to be a bridesmaid in the summer of 2011 she felt unable to say no.

Although spurred into action Martha fell pregnant again straight after the wedding and was forced to put her weight-loss dreams on hold until March 2012.

She joined her local Slimming World group and has now dropped to a stunning 9st 5lbs and a svelte size 10.

'I decided I wanted my active life back, I wanted to enjoy my children growing up and be able to wear what I wanted,' she said.

'When I was younger I had a really 
healthy, active lifestyle but each time I had a child I put a lot of 
weight on. I'd lose most of it and then fall pregnant again.

'I loved Slimming World because it taught me that I could eat what I wanted I just had to watch how much of it I ate.

'It was great for me because I lost all enthusiasm to go to the gym and the group focused on healthy eating.

'I cook everything from scratch now, it just tastes lovely, and I can't get enough fruit and veg. I just love my size now, I feel so much better.'

She added that husband Phil, 33, had been supportive throughout her weight loss.

'Phil told me that he didn't realise how much weight I had gained until I lost it, although he has always supported me no matter my size,' she said.

Martha is now training as a consultant for Slimming World and is opening a new group in Ubley Parish Hall, in Ubley, near Bladgon, on Monday.
