Arthritis sufferers have been given new hope following the success of a drug that appears to ease the crippling symptoms of the disease.

Patients who took Sarilumab were more mobile and suffered less inflammation to their joints, a study found.

The new treatment - involving an injection once a fortnight - also slowed progression of the incurable disease.

Hope: Patients who took Sarilumab found they were more mobile and suffered less inflammation to their joints

Scientists carried out a year-long study on 1,200 patients with active, moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis, who have not benefited from or been 
able to tolerate the side effects of current frontline treatment methotrexate.

They found Sarilumba improved their condition by up to 20 per cent, according to the Daily Express.

Developed by French drugmaker Sanofi and Regeneron, the new drug works by blocking an inflammation-causing protein called interleukin 6.

Patients given a 200 mg dose 
of Sarilumba every other week - on top of methotrexate - saw a 66 percent 
improvement in the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis after six 
months.

Meanwhile, those given a 150 mg dose saw
 a 58 percent improvement.

Reported
 side effects included infections, as well as increases in 'bad' 
low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholestoral and transaminases.

Last night, scientists, doctors and charities hailed the drug as a breakthrough in the fight against rheumetoid arthritis.

A
 spokesman for the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society (NRAS) said: 
'If this drug gives another option for those living with the disease to 
lead a fuller and more productive life then this can only be a positive 
development.'

Meanwhile, a spokesman for 
Arthritis Research UK said: 'The initial results from this trial look 
quite promising in terms of reducing painful symptoms - although Sarilumab is still under development and results of this study have not 
yet been published.'

More than 700,000 people in the UK suffer the agonising effects of rheumatoid arthritis, in which the 
body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue, causing 
inflammation and pain in the joints.

Although there is currently no cure, numerous treatments are used to alleviate sufferers' pain.

Common
 treatments include anti-inflammatory painkillers and anti-rheumatic 
drugs, such as methotrexate, which are used to slow joint damage .

The success of Sarilumba pushes the new drug one step closer to the production line.

It could be available in 10 years if it is officially approved.
