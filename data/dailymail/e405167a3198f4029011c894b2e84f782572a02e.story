Christian Benteke is edging closer to a return to action and could play some part when Manchester City visit Villa Park a week on Saturday.

This weekend's match against Chelsea comes too soon but Paul Lambert will decide whether the Belgian is ready for an Under-21 clash with Bolton on Monday as part of his re-integration following five months out with a ruptured Achilles.

The virus that spread throughout Lambert's squad and undermined their loss to Arsenal looks to have been eradicated after the ground was closed on Monday.

Christian's Benteke's imminent return to the Aston Villa squad will come as a huge boost to Paul Lambert

Aston Villa captain Ron Vlaar will return to Paul Lambert's squad after the international break

Captain Ron Vlaar will not feature before the international break due to his groin injury however.

But the news is more positive on Benteke. 'He's getting closer,' said Lambert. 'Next week we will see how he is for the Man City game. I'm not saying he'll start, or anything, but he's certainly getting close.

'He's had another good week under his belt. People forget he's been out five months, he's only trained three weeks. 'He's not done a pre-season. But playing football he's been getting a few kicks.

'The injury is totally fine, I'm not worried about that. He's taken a couple little kicks in training and has come through them. He's an athlete.

'It's just his lack of practise. You've got to watch he doesn't break down after too much too soon.

'Everybody is happy to see him come back. It's been a long road for him, missed the World Cup. Him coming back has been great. It will give everyone a lift when he comes back, supporters included.

'Common sense has to prevail. It would be a risk to throw him in.'
