A widow has been left distraught after the sea view she cherished with her late husband has been blocked by an extension next door.

Joyce Reynolds, 84, and her husband Kenneth bought the four-bedroom home in Newquay, Cornwall, 14 years ago to be near the sea.

Before he died last year, Mr Reynolds dedicated himself to building a terrace in the garden where they could sit to watch the waves.

Distraught: Joyce Reynolds, 84, once had sprawling views of the Cornish sea but is now faced with a 15ft wall

Blocked: This is the start of a brick wall built by the guest house next door that will block Mrs Reynolds' view

But now, just months later, the terrace is shrouded in shade cast by a 15ft-high wall, blocking the sight of the shore.

It is part of works on the Trewlawn Guest House next door, that will also see first-floor and second-floor balconies erected next to Mrs Reynolds' windows.

Blasting the works, which started in January, the grandmother-of-12 said: 'My husband built the terrace - he used to love looking out there.

'We had beautiful views of the sea from both the bedroom and kitchen windows.

'I
 used to love looking out during stormy days when the sea was rough. Now
 the only way I can see the sea is if I go right to the end of the 
terrace.

Before: Mrs Reynolds and her late husband Kenneth, who died last year, bought the home 14 years ago for its view of the sea. Kenneth dedicated himself to building a terrace where they could sit to watch the waves

Works: Mrs Reynolds last year objected to the plans, which were put into action in January

'My husband died last summer and a few months later this happened.

'This past year has been hell - it’s not what you expect at the end of your life.'

Mrs Reynolds, who also has four great grandchildren, said she objected to the plans when they were first drawn up months after Kenneth died at the age of 85 of acute myeloid leukemia.

Her neighbour and son-in-law have since written to the council to complain about their handling of the case, but they have had no progress.

'They
 started building in January and it’s still not complete. There are 
builders at the property five days a week making a racket.

'My husband used to love looking out there. We had beautiful views of the sea. Now I can't see anything'

'When the plans were first up drawn last year we objected twice 
but Cornwall Council passed them and we couldn’t do anything more.

'My
 son-in-law and neighbour wrote to the council a couple of months ago to
 complain about whether they’re fit for purpose to pass this type of 
planning permission as it goes against everything we believe.

'If we don’t have any success with them then we’re going to go to an ombudsman.'

Despite the concerns, Newquay Town Council supported the plans when it met to discuss the application last year.

But it ordered the guest house to erect 'screening' between the balconies and Mrs Reynolds' home to maintain her privacy.

The town authority also requested that the balconies are only used as outdoor seating to keep noise levels to a minimum.

Cornwall Council said: 'The occupiers of neighbouring properties were consulted in accordance with council procedure.

Balconies: Balconies have also been erected next to Mrs Reynolds' windows in Newquay, Cornwall

'Following receipt of objections from neighbours at numbers 20 and 26, two site visits were carried out in order to address their concerns.

'Having carefully assessed the proposal, it was concluded that any potential loss of view and light would not be so significant as to warrant a refusal of planning permission.

'The matter of possible loss of privacy from proposed balconies was addressed by the imposition of a condition requiring privacy screening.

'Potential loss of sea views and devaluation of property are not material planning considerations.'

The council said it is checking the development is being built in accordance with approved plans and will meet residents on site to explain the development.

The building’s owners - Isabel Fisher and Dirk Parker - did not wish to comment.
