An Australian Muslim convert who boasts about being the third most 'liked' extremist preacher on Facebook, has announced he is travelling to Syria to join the jihad.

Born Robert Cerantonio to an Italian father and a mother of Irish heritage, the former Catholic who is said to have renounced his Australian citizenship and has been living in the Philippines since 2013, posted on Twitter that he was heading to the war-torn country to join with his 'brothers' in the Islamic State of Iraq and the Sham (ISIS).

His message prompted a series of messages of support from his hardline followers, some of whom appeared to already be in Syria or Iraq.

Cerantonio received overwhelming support from his followers on Twitter when he announced his travel plans

‘Insha'Allah I will be arriving in Ash-Sham very shortly, keep us in your du'a, getting ready to travel,’ he posted on Wednesday, using the Arabic name for Syria.

Cerantonio, who is known to use social media to recruit supporters for a worldwide jihad against the West and encourage Muslims to join ISIS, received an overwhelmingly positive response from his followers about his travel plans.

Many comments wished him a safe trip while one excited supporter suggested ‘we'll go for the khilafahs finest falafel when you get here’.

Some followers also expressed concern after Cerantonio, who is under investigation by the Australian Federal Police for inciting Australians to fight in Syria, had been inactive on Twitter over the past three weeks.

‘Nice to have you back among us brother, I was worried about you, I heard that the police was (sic) looking for you’ @moslima999 posted. 

A study conducted in early 2014 by the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation found that one in four foreign fighters followed Cerantonio’s Twitter account and his Facebook page is the third-most ‘liked’ among jihadists.

Cerantonio boasted about the Federal Government looking for him on his Facebook page on June 27.

He gave an internet sermon sponsored by the now closed Islamic Al Risalah Bookstore in Sydney's Bankstown on April 2, 2013 in which he declared the 'crusaders and the Zionists' were the real terrorists, not Muslims.

‘So apparently the Australian Federal Police are looking for me – Let’s see how well they can hunt,’ he said. ‘Have fun finding me, I’ll be waiting for you or whichever dogs you send.’

Follower, Salafi Manhaj, then joined in on the joke: ‘HAHAHAHA lol good luck for them. May Allah always keep you safe my dear beloved brother.'

According to the Terrorism Research & Analysis Consortium think tank, Cerantonio once said: ‘I do not doubt that I have called upon all believers, whether young or old, to respond to the commands of God.’

He added that such calls were made to unite the ranks of all Muslims ‘as one nation under the leadership of a Khalifah (spiritual and political head) who rules by Allah's Law.’

The Catholic who converted to Islam at 17, and is said to also speak Italian, used to host the live English-language TV show, Ask the Sheikh, from Egypt on which he answered viewers' questions about Islam.

Cerantonio has five siblings and two daughters, Aisha and Sophia, converted to Islam in 2002 after visiting the Vatican left him disillusioned with Catholicism.

He was said to be particularly disgusted by Michelangelo's artwork on the roof of the Sistine Chapel – calling it 'idol worship'.

'And I felt in my heart that this, it's not right,' he said in a video titled, From Darkness To Light. 'Even though I've grown up being told this is what I'm supposed to believe, I reject it.'

Cerantonio expressed his frustration about not being able to put his religious views into practice.

'Even though my family considered ourselves to be the truth we weren’t very practicing,' he said in 2011. 'Whilst we were Catholic and Christian by name, we didn’t really do much we didn’t go to church except on Christmas or Easter.'

'I used to loved hearing about all of the gods - I used to really love it and it would touch my heart however I never had the access of turning that love into action,' he said.
