This is the moment that a thief was caught on camera as he came out of the wardrobe he had been hiding in for 13 hours, armed with a poker.

Aaron Bradford, 18, broke into Rosalinde Potter's house in Yelverton, Devon, for a third time in the middle of the afternoon but was disturbed when she returned at 2.40pm.

She saw the house had been ransacked and called police unaware that Bradford was still in her home and when police arrived he stayed quiet in his hiding place.

Armed with a poker, Aaron Bradford, 18, looks around one of the rooms of after hiding for 13 hours

He switched a light on briefly to have a look round the room to see if there was anything worth taking

He then plunges the room into darkness again and uses his mobile phone to make his way through the room

Bradford tiptoes through the home slowly and carefully before leaving the house with a camera and laptop

But what he did not know is that Ms Potter had installed CCTV cameras after being victim to burglaries in the past.

She said: 'We were all in the room while he was there - me, a police officer, another officer taking fingerprints, my partner. He was within arms reach of all of us.

'There’s a shelf inside and I assume he was sitting there like a gnome holding a fishing rod. He’s slim but 6ft tall so I think that’s the only way he could have done it.

Brazen: Aaron Bradford was disturbed by the owner just before 3pm and then hid in the house until 4am, when he sneaked out with a laptop, camera and cash

'We went into the spare room with the 
police three times while he was sat inside there. I went back into the 
room myself later too. It’s very disturbing to think that someone might 
actually want to hit me with a poker.

'It took me three weeks before I could even sleep at night just thinking someone could be in the house.'

The cameras filmed him as he tried to make a
getaway with a laptop and camera, brandishing a poker at 4am once his 
victim had gone to bed.

In one clip that Ms Potter released, 
Bradford can be seen going into a room where he stands for a short while
before turning a light on.

He surveys the room, turns the light off and then using the glow from his mobile phone he carefully tiptoes around.

He was arrested nearby and 
identified by the CCTV footage, which showed him entering the house on 
one day – and then leaving it on the next.

After his arrest police found
the stolen laptop in a bag that Bradford had with him.

Prosecutor David Gittins said: ‘The
householder returned home to find the patio doors forced and items 
moved within the house.

‘She reported the break-in to police. 
He hid in the wardrobe for 13 hours till 4am, then stole a camera, a 
laptop and a small amount of cash.’

Mr Gittins said CCTV of the break-in 
had shown Bradford  wearing a hood and entering the house on April 7, 
and leaving it on April 8.

The security cameras at his victim’s 
house had been installed after Bradford burgled it on a previous occasion. He took electrical items and jewellery worth £20,000.

Bradford, of Plymouth, admitted burgling the house on three other occasions and also a string of other offences.

In
June, he had been involved in a robbery in which ‘a girl was used as 
decoy or bait’, the court heard. She had contacted a man that she had 
been friendly with at school and said she would like to see him.

After the victim paid for her taxi to 
his flat, she brought with her a group of men who were armed, masked and
hooded, one of whom was Bradford.

They burst into the flat with knives and baseball bats and robbed the man of cash, his Apple laptop and his mobile phone.

Bradford also admitted using a bank card stolen from a woman’s handbag to draw cash from her bank account.

In addition, he stole a man’s bank 
details and used them to act as a guarantor for a loan, securing £466 to
pay for 45 mobile phone top-ups.

Jason Beal, for Bradford, said his client showed ‘contrition and remorse’ and had made ‘full and frank’ admissions.

He said: ‘This is terribly sad. He has
been in care as a child, been fostered by people who were kind to him 
and now shows contrition and remorse. His ambition is to join the Army.’

Bradford was sentenced to five years in a young offenders’ institution, less 57 days spent on remand.

Judge Graham Cottle told Bradford: ‘It is unclear what underpinned this sudden spate of serious offending.’
