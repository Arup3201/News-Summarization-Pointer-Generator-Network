A fellow television dad is weighing in on the numerous allegations of sexual assault  that have been leveled at Bill Cosby over the past few months.

Alan Thicke, who starred in Growing Pains and was a producer on Cosby's variety show Cos back in the 70s, said in a recent interview; 'There is no doubt in my mind Bill Cosby was a bad boy.'

This despite the fact that Thicke also states in the interview that he still considers Cosby a friend.

'When there’s that much conversation. When there’s that much smoke, there must be some fire,' Thicke told the Toronto Star.

'I’m sure that Bill must have been a bad boy. I think the issue will be to what degree.' 

That being said, Thicke was also quick to point out that he never once witnessed any of this behavior from Cosby.

'In my history with Bill, I saw absolutely nothing of the controversy around him now,' said Thicke. 

'I just saw a guy who was doing his job.'

And while he is quick to praise Cosby for all he contributed to the world of comedy, and for being 'one of the guys who really rescued the sitcom,' Thicke also says that he is not sure how to 'move forward' in his relationship with the  actor, noting that he has not spoken to him since women began coming forward last October claiming they were drugged and raped by the comedian.

Cosby meanwhile is continuing his North American stand-up tour, seemingly oblivious to the protesters who have begun gathering outside his shows.

That being said, the actor just suffered another major blow as a result of these allegations, with NBC revealing earlier this month that they would not be moving forward with a previously announced show featuring the actor.

'Fifteen women came out and accused him of what they accused him of,' said NBC Entertainment Chairman Bob Greenblatt.

He also said it was 'safe to say' the network would never again work with Cosby in any capacity. 

In other recent developments, Cosby's lawyer Martin Singer announced last week that he had evidence the actor was in New York City on the night model Chloe Goins has accused him of drugging and sexually assaulting her at the Playboy Mansion.

Goins, who claims she was attacked by Cosby in 2008, is the first woman to come forward whose allegations did not fall outside the statue of limitations.
