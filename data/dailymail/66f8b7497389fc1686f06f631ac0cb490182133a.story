A bus driver knocked down and fatally injured a 74-year-old pedestrian when he made ‘an error of judgement’ that could have been influenced by a green driving bonus scheme.

Great-grandmother Sheila Bowling was crossing the road pulling a shopping trolley and was only a step away from the pavement when hit by the bus driven by David Cameron, 59.

The single-decker bus was doing no more than 14mph and Cameron had time to brake or swerve to miss Mrs Bowling, but failed to do either, Sheffield Crown Court heard yesterday.

Cameron told police his employer First Bus gave weekly cash prizes – a £50 top prize and five £30 runner-up prizes – to the ‘greenest drivers’.

Drivers are evaluated by a computerised system which uses dashboard ‘traffic lights’ to encourage smooth driving. The system is supposed to improve safety and save money through fuel efficiency. Red and amber lights flash in front of the driver when inefficient manoeuvres such as sharp braking or jerking the steering wheel are performed. A green light indicates ‘low risk’ driving.

The accident happened in Sheffield city centre in November 2013. Mrs Bowling suffered serious head injuries and died four days later.

Cameron, of Gleadless, Sheffield, admitted causing death by careless driving. He was given a 12-month community order, 100 hours’ unpaid work and banned from driving for a year. He has also been sacked.

Judge Robert Moore said: ‘The system his company employs encourages gradual acceleration and deceleration and resistance as far as possible from turning the steering wheel fiercely.

‘It may have been possible had he used greater steering to avoid the lady who was in the last two metres of crossing this road. There was a clear error of judgement in that respect.’

The judge gave no opinion on what role, if any, the US-designed Drive Green system may have played in the tragedy. A First Bus spokesman said customer safety was a ‘priority’.
