A young violinist who could no longer play after her broken arm healed at a bent angle is now back performing on her favourite instrument thanks to a long flexible nail inserted into her forearm.

Eliza Andre-Browning, 14, broke her right arm during a PE lesson and could no longer play the violin after her arm healed at a bent angle.

Her parents were so concerned they took her for a second opinion to a surgeon at Southampton Children’s Hospital to ask if there was anything he could do to help her continue her musical career.

Surgeon Ed Gent then re-broke her arm and fixed it in place using a special titanium nail.

After a few weeks of rest, her arm healed in the correct position and now Eliza is back playing her violin.

Before and after: Eliza Andre-Browning's right forearm was left bent in the middle after it healed from a break, pictured right, but it is now straight again after a flexible nail was inserted by surgeons, pictured left 

She has recently received the most promising player award from the orchestra that she plays with.

Her mother, Rebecca Andre-Browning, 46, a teaching assistant, said: ‘We are just so thrilled. The operation has given Eliza her confidence back and she can play the violin again, which is wonderful to hear.

‘She was devastated when she broke her arm and couldn’t play the violin afterwards. Her arm was bent at such an angle that it made it impossible for her to play. Now she is back playing and loving every minute of it.’

Eliza suffered the injury whilst having a PE lesson at school in November 2011, when she tripped over a trampoline.

She went to Salisbury General Hospital where her arm was put in plaster for eight weeks.

But when the plaster was removed, Eliza’s arm had healed in a bent position, an occurrence which is rare but not unheard of and made it impossible for her to straighten it.

Jumping for joy: Eliza Andre-Browning had feared that she would never be able to play her instrument again

Mrs Andre-Browning, who lives with 
husband Gerard, 50, a primary school support worker, in Salisbury, said:
‘We were shocked when the plaster cast was removed as she couldn’t 
straighten her arm at all.

‘Eliza was very embarrassed about what it looked like, so she wore long sleeved tops all the time. But it also meant that she couldn’t play her violin anymore. She had been a very promising violinist up until the accident. It was a lot for a 12 year old girl to cope with.

‘She’s been playing since the age of nine, and has already passed her grade four examination. She loves playing the violin and it was heartbreaking that she couldn’t play it anymore. She couldn’t rotate or straighten her arm at all.’

So Mrs Andre-Browning took Eliza back to see her GP in August last year, and she was referred to surgeon Ed Gent at Southampton Children’s Hospital. He said he would try and re-break her arm and fix it using the special long flexible nail.

Mrs Andre-Browning said: ‘Eliza was so excited before her operation. We were nervous in case it didn’t work, but we wanted her to have the chance to play her violin again and live a normal life.’

The operation was carried out in November and was a success. She remained in a plaster cast for six weeks and when it was removed, her arm was perfectly straight.

Eliza is now back playing her violin and is due to sit her grade five examination. She is also studying for her music GCSE exam and has just been awarded the Most Promising Player award from her orchestra.

Mrs Andre-Browning said: ‘She is thrilled to be back playing her violin and its all thanks to the surgeon who has helped her achieve that. We are so grateful.

‘It is wonderful to hear her playing again. When her bone was so bent, we never thought it would be possible again. But now she can play beautifully again.’

Surgeon Ed Gent said: ‘We corrected her arm fracture and stabilised it with an intramedullary flexible nail. She has now healed up, has full rotation once more and is back playing her violin - a fantastic result.’
