It's the Aussie workplace that employees can't get enough of, with all-day nerf gun wars, midnight movie sessions, unlimited food, office pets and a basketball court.

The Townsville office is set to expand, with an exciting new Sydney office in the works which promises to be even more exciting.

'We're coming to Sydney to take on Google as one of the best places to work in Australia,' promises Luke Anear, the CEO of SafetyCulture.

The ten-year-old software development company started out in a garage, but 15 months ago moved into their incredible 1000 square-metre, multi-level complex.

The Townsville office boasts a basketball court, which is used to release tension and for team bonding

The SafetyCulture office gets daily deliveries from the supermarket to fully equip the kitchen with a range of foods, to ensure the team has 'unlimited food'

The company is growing rapidly, with some of the world's top international engineers flocking to north Queensland to work with SafetyCulture.

This year, 21 new employees started with the company in just ten weeks, thanks to the appeal of a happy workplace that is focussed on the well-being of the staff.

'We've got a culture that says that we value people,' Mr Anear told Daily Mail Australia.

'The number one thing is that we’re here to take care of and support our employees.

'Plus, it's amazing how a clash of visions can be resolved over a Ping-Pong table!' 

The office is a hub of innovation, which Mr Anear says translates to inspired work from the employees.

The pet-friendly office boasts a basketball court, 75-seat movie theatre, stand up desks, kitchen with unlimited supplies and even a 'chill out' room, fitted with sleeping bags.

'Having some down time is just as important, particularly the type of work we do where we work unusual hours because we provide 24 hour support for clients,' said Mr Anear. 

'It’s a pet-friendly place. Dogs are a particularly good de-stresser, it can be relief in a tense moment when they come up for a pat.' 

Mr Anear says that his investment in his employees' happiness is invaluable, and he is 'part of a trend that companies need to take'.

'With a compelling culture it feels like engineers can do their best work,' he explained.

'It's better than the traditional corporate environment where you work in a pale-coloured office and if you've got a window, you're lucky!'

Games and competitions lifts the mood in the SafetyCulture office, helping the individuals to enjoy their workplace and boosting team morale. 

CEO Luke Anear is always looking for new ways to make the office a more enjoyable place for employees

Standing desks, which can also be converted into sitting desks, have been found to increase the employees' energy levels and improve concentration

Every new employee is initiated with their own nerf gun.

'The nerf guns are a big thing, we have on-going battles. 

'It’s a team fun environment and we often have team nerf wars from one end of the building to the other.

'People often shoot each other while they're working, so then the person waiting for the opportunity to retaliate when the other person least expects it throughout the day.'

'It all that adds to the light-heartedness and keeps us on our toes!'

As CEO, Mr Anear says it's incredibly important that he also partakes in the fun.

'Having the boss involved can be a positive thing,' said Mr Anear.

'It helps me maintain a rapport and interact with different staff and it’s key to have the person at the top involved.'

'I certainly cop my fair share of nerf bullets!' 

The team is shown during an international Skype conference call. The office chooses to use stimulating bright colours, instead of the usual boring, pale office decor - including the use of an Anchorman movie poster!

He insists that the antics make employees more productive, rather than serving as a distraction. 

'When the business is busy and we don’t play games as much, everyone feels it, the energy tightens up – it turns into a normal work place!' he said.

'The activities help to maintain a good feeling.'

'Without them, tension in workplaces build up over time. People can get burnt out or jaded with the work they’re doing.'

The Townsville team is growing quickly and a Sydney branch will open next month in inner city Surry Hills

Mr Anear says that the theory is inspired by scientific research into employee happiness and productivity. 

'The company needs to be healthy and productive - you’ve got to strike that balance.'

'Science is behind our approach but the art is in finding balance.'

Young university interns are the only people that may take 'playtime' a little too far. 

‘We only have to put our foot down with some of the uni interns,' Mr Anear explains with a laugh.

'We have nine interns who come from uni, see all these nerf guns and great facilities and they tend to lack a bit of discretion in finding balance’  he said.

‘So it’s really just with them that we need to make a bit of a rule book!'

The CEO insists that the approach increases the office's productivity, rather than distracting employees. 'It is all about having the right balance'

The activities, as well as the use of 'stand up desks', are found to result in heightened concentration and energy levels, according to the SafetyCulture CEO.  

'The stand up desks increase the amount of oxygen flowing through to keep your body moving,' said Anear.

'It helps you to stay alert, youdon’t hit the wall like you mostly do in a normal office.'

With the help of a quick basketball, chess or Ping-Pong game, the team can avoid the dreaded 'three-thirtyitis'

Everybody has reported positive benefits from it in that regard; everybody has felt that they can concentrate better

'I feel more alert, and can think clearly without the lull or any daydreaming.

'And the threat of a nerf gun keeps everybody on their toes!' 

SafetyCulture will start a Sydney engineering team in Surry Hills in December, and are looking for new ways to 'raise the bar.'

'We're always looking for new ways to make sure more fun is being had at work.

'We have fun and do great work.'
