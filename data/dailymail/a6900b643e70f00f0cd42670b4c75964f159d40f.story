On Thursday afternoon radical new measures were announced for Parliament House, set to force women wearing the burqa to sit in an enclosed room behind glass screens.

However on Thursday evening it was revealed by Fairfax Media that Prime Minister Tony Abbott had backed down on the plans proposed by Speaker Bronwyn Bishop and Senate President Stephen Parry earlier in the day.

Mr Abbott is said to have been forced to ask Ms Bishop and Mr Parry to reconsider the plan due to extreme public backlash.

Despite this, the prime minister is likely to maintain that different measures apply for more secure areas of the building.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott has backed down on new measures set to be put in place which ban Muslim women wearing the burqa from sitting in certain parts of parliament

Labor and the Greens are worried parliament is signalling it's OK to treat Muslim women poorly, and Independent MP Andrew Wilkie has slammed it as 'religious apartheid'.

'The decision by the government to isolate, in their own rooms, burqa-wearers observing the parliament has no security merit at all,' Mr Wilkie said.

Mrs Bishop's office told AAP on Thursday night they were yet to have any contact from the prime minister on the matter.

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said Mr Abbott let the divisive debate on banning burqas and niqabs drag on too long.

'If we're asking our troops to stand up to sectarianism, intolerance and prejudice overseas, we should be prepared to do the same in our parliament,' he told AAP. 

Labor also wrote asking Mrs Bishop to reconsider the move, saying every Australian should feel welcome visiting Parliament House.

Senate President Stephen Parry says security officers need to be able to quickly identify people shouting out from the public galleries.

Some senators have condemned the planned move saying it has no security merit, while others said Mr Abbott does not have the power to veto the decision

He insists it's an interim measure until Australian Federal Police and ASIO advise him and Mrs Bishop on screening policies in relation to garments that hide identity.

Liberal Senator George Christensen said on Thursday night people shouldn't get their hopes up over the prime ministerial intervention because Mr Abbott didn't have a veto over the presiding officers' decisions.

The ABC report that two ministers told them that the move to discriminate against Australians with face coverings was a mistake, and one apparently described the plan as 'incredibly foolish'. 

Reports from Fairfax Media earlier on Thursday revealed the changes that were set to be introduced for the presiding officers regarding access arrangements.

Article C of the changes stated: 'Persons with facial coverings entering the galleries of the House of Representatives and Senate will be seated in the enclosed galleries. This will ensure that persons with facial coverings can continue to enter the Chamber galleries, without needing to be identifiable'.

It meant women who wear face coverings will still be allowed to enter parliament and view the proceedings and overcome potential problems for security staff who are required to identify all visitors seated in the lower public gallery. 

The enclosed space (on a floor above) is usually reserved for children on school excursions, to limit noise disruptions.

The move comes as outspoken Senator Jacqui Lambie clashed on live TV with a  Muslim woman as she continued to call for burqas to be banned.   

Spat: Senator Lambie appeared on the program with Muslim Women's Association spokeswoman Maha Abdo

In a spirited debate on the Seven's Sunrise program, Palmer United Party Senator Ms Lambie said the debate was a 'national security issue' because people needed to be identifiable.

But Muslim Women's Association executive officer Maha Abdo, who wears a hijab, laughed off her comments, insisting someone wearing a burqa is not a threat..  

'How is that going to be a threat? That's a question for you,' Ms Abdo said.

Ms Lambie said she needed to be able to see people's faces and 'body language' at all times. 

'We need to be able to identify people walking on the streets, that's what's going on,' she said. 

But Ms Abdo insisted Muslim women were allowed to lift their veil to show their faces to authorities.

Debate: Maha Abdo, the executive officer of the Muslim Women's Association

'It is a given that for identification purposes, Muslim women, within reason, can just lift up and show their ID,' she said. 

Under further questioning, Ms Lambie said she would not ask people to remove hats, overcoats or other clothing as she could see their faces. 

Ms Abdo replied that she could easily ask to see the face of a woman wearing a burqa if she asked. 'You can see it! No one's stopping you from not seeing it.'

Ms Lambie fired back: 'I cannot see who is under that clothing. I can't see if there's a man or woman under that clothing.'

'No one's stopping you from seeing it though!' Ms Abdo said.

Fiery confrontation: Ms Lambie came under questioning from Ms Abdo

Ms Lambie also admitted she had never asked a Muslim woman to show their face to her. 

'Is there any reason -  why do you -  do you feel offended that I'm asking you to show your face?' she asked Ms Abdo. 

'We live in this wonderful country. And I'm very aware, that, you know, you have beautiful faces, and... it would be nice to be able to see them.

'But it still comes back to a national security issue'.  

The senator also praised Prime Minister Tony Abbott for his 'courage' and 'strength' in publicly branding the burqa 'confronting' yesterday. 

'I've said before that I find it a fairly confronting form of attire, and frankly I wish it was not worn,' Mr Abbott told reporters. 

'Confronting'. The Prime Minister Tony Abbott (pictured centre) yesterday repeated remarks he had made in the past about the burqa

'But we are a free country and a free society and it's not the business of government to tell people what they should and should not wear.'

Mr Abbott also said that, as far as he was aware, no woman has ever worn a burqa into Parliament House.

Liberal Senator Cory Bernardi has written to Parliament's presiding officers requesting the burqa be banned from the premises.

Last month, Ms Lambie re-posted a meme of a woman wearing a burqa holding a gun which was captioned: 'For security reasons it is time to ban the burqa'.

Outspoken Independent MP Andrew Wilkie said 'the decision by the Government to isolate, in their own rooms, burqa-wearers observing the Parliament has no security merit at all. The segregation of one group of people like this is nothing more than religious apartheid and deeply wrong'.
