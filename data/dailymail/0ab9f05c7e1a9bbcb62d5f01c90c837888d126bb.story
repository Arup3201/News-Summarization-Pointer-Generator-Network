When she bought 14 of Princess Diana's dresses at Christie's in June 1997, Maureen Rorech Dunkel had no idea that in just three months, they would become virtually priceless.

After Diana's death in a Paris car crash, the Florida businesswoman set up a charitable foundation which was supposed to display the gowns around the world and continue the princess's legacy.

But instead Ms Dunkel racked up at least $2.5million in debt through failed exhibitions, and tomorrow faces the embarrassment of auctioning off all 14 dresses to pay off her creditors.

It's a sad end for the historic dresses, which include the stunning midnight-blue Victor Edelstein gown the princess wore when she danced with John Travolta at the White House in 1985, and two used in her iconic Vanity Fair photoshoots with Mario Testino.

Although they went on display across the world, including at Kensington Palace in London, they also wound up at less-than-glamorous locations including Downtown Disney and an old furniture shop in Hyde Park Village, Tampa.

Ms Dunkel, 50, hopes to make around $4million from tomorrow's auction in Toronto, which comes ahead of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's official visit to the country next week.

Auctioneers Waddington's say some of the proceeds will go to the National Ballet School of Canada, but much of it will be used to pay off Ms Dunkel's debts.

She filed for bankruptcy in 2010, after using the dresses as collateral to secure a $1.5million loan for a housing project which ended in failure.

Her attorney, Jeffrey Warren, told the St Petersburg Times: 'A lot of her money was spent on that real estate development that went 
sour. But she worked out a 
plan to pay all her creditors in full.

'After these dresses are sold, her
 creditors will be paid first. And the dresses are far more valuable 
than what she owes.'

She bought the gowns at Christie's in New York in June 1997, when Princess Diana auctioned off 79 of her dresses, raising $3.25million for her favourite charities.

At that time they cost Ms Dunkel $670,000. Tomorrow, many will go for that sum each, with the iconic Edelstein expected to fetch around $1million.

All but one of the dresses were made especially for Diana, and half were designed by Catherine Walker.

They include a black halterneck dress she wore at Versailles, which is expected to fetch up to $275,000, and an elegant red dress and coat in which she attended the 1990 première of Steel Magnolias.

There is also a Bruce Oldfield 
gown, in dramatic black velvet, which she wore to the première of Les 
Misérables in London in 1995 and is listed at $175,000-225,000.

Shortly after Diana's death in September
 1997, Ms Dunkel announced her plan to take the dresses around the 
world, hoping to inspire young girls and make millions for charity in an
 exhibition entitled Dresses For Humanity.

She
 set up the People's Princess Charitable Foundation, which intended to 
'perpetuate the charitable objectives supported by the late Diana, 
Princess of Wales', according to an IRS form at the time.

By 2001, the dresses had toured Canada, the UK and New Zealand, netting more than $1.5million for the foundation, which gave the money to Metropolitan Ministries and the Boys and Girls Club, the St Petersburg Times reports.

But the foundation was already running into trouble as expenses began to mount. In the first year alone, Ms Dunkel spent more than $1milion on legal fees, public relations consultancy and building the exhibits, and she had to loan it $1million of her own money just to keep it going.

By 2001, the foundation was beginning to
 flounder, according to its tax filing for that year. It read: 
'Insurance on the dresses during transportation was very high, and 
attendance and retail sales at each venue were well below projections.'

'The exhibit was shown at three venues, however none provided a profit.'

She
 loaned the exhibition to Kensington Palace for a short time in 2002, 
but her attempts to hold a glamorous charity fundraiser at Diana's 
former home failed miserably when sponsors failed to materialise.

The foundation lost $115,878 in preparing for the event, and had to refund $47,250 in ticket sales.

In
 a 2004 tax filing seen by the St Petersburg Times, the foundation 
borrowed $38,000 from the Bank of Tampa, and another $50,000 from 
Patricia Sullivan, whose former husband founded Outback Steakhouse.

Two
 years later she decided to turn to real estate development, and 
borrowed $1.5million from HRH Ventures - using the dresses as collateral
 - to fund a housing project.

But that, too, failed to go ahead, and in 2009 HRH Ventures sued Ms Dunkel and the foundation, asking for five of the dresses.

By the time she filed for bankruptcy in January the following year, Ms Dunkel owed around $3.5million, including $1million to Sumter Homes, 
Bank of Florida, Holland & Knight, Bank of America and Northstar Bank.

With auctioneers estimating the 14 gowns could make as much as $4.15million, Ms Dunkel will at last be hoping the dresses can bring her financial help rather than woe.

In the auction catalogue, she wrote: 'It is time to close the "Diana Dress" chapter of my life and focus on my greatest love, my desire to use my time, talents and treasure to serve God.'
