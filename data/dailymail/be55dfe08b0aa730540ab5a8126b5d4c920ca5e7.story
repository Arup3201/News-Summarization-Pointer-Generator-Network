A Thai tourist faced down a charging elephant and stopped it in its tracks with just a wave of his hand.

Tor Bowling, 27, was visiting Phu Luang Wildlife Sanctuary, northern Thailand, when the elephant came charging straight towards him out of the dense jungle.

But rather than understandably screaming and running for his life, Mr Bowling simply held up his hand up to the animal, which stopped, turned around, and walked away.

You shall not pass! Brave Tor Bowling wards off an elephant charge with a wave of his hand

Maybe I won't squash you after all, human: The rampaging elephant amazingly seems to comply

Err, yes: The beast gives an almighty shriek and turns away from the intrepid tourist

... who wastes no time in holding up his camera and firing off a few frames of the departing pachyderm

A video of Mr Bowling's bravery has now been viewed millions of times online.

Mr
 Bowling, an engineer from Chonburi, near Bangkok, told the New York 
Daily News that he had quit his job out of boredom and was spending a 
month travelling around his country while he looks for new direction in 
life.

It was the afternoon 
of February 28 when he was making his way along a dirt path at Phu Luang
 with his friend Navee Kittisak, on their way back to civilisation after
 going to see a dinosaur footprint.

The
 reserve is home to around a hundred wild Asian elephants, cared for by 
the Thai royal family-sponsored Elephants Rehabilitation Project.

Mr
 Bowling was visiting during the local summer season, when Phu Luang 
blossoms with colourful dendrobiums, white wild orchids, and white and 
red rhododendrons.

Mr Bowling told Daily News reporter Joel Landau that when he first saw the elephant, a moment not included in the clip, he froze and stared at it for a long time.

He tried to edge away, but the elephant tracked his every move, he said. Then the beast charged.

Mr Bowling admitted he was afraid. Extending his hand at the animal was merely his first reaction, he admitted - a completely unpremeditated response.

'But I'm sure,' he said. 'It didn't want to hurt me.' And indeed it didn't for, as the video shows, mere inches from Mr Bowling's outstretched arm, the elephant stops, lets out a fierce shriek, and turns away.

Fear: Mr Dowling said he had spent a long time frozen to the spot staring after he saw the elephant in the bush

He said he was frightened when it charged, but looking back he thinks it didn't want to hurt him

As it pads off into the bush, Mr Bowling showed just how much composure he had maintained by holding up his camera and capturing a few shots of the retreating animal for his photo album.

He then turns to Mr Kittisak, who was filming the incident, and chuckles.

Mr Bowling told the Daily News his sanguine reaction in the face of near certain death beneath the stomping feet of the elephant was just down to his positive attitude.

'I always think (everything that happens to me) is a special moment and I think I'm lucky to have had the chance to experience that,' he was quoted as saying.

'I don't need (to think of things) as bad memories. So I smile to make it a good situation.'

Despite their popular association with Thailand, often as domesticated beasts of burden, Asian elephants are an endangered species because of the illegal trade in ivory.

They grow up to 10ft tall and can weigh as much as 5.5 tons.
