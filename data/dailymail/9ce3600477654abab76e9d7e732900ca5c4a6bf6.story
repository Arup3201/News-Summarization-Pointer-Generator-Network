In one of the most partisan speeches of his presidency, an under-fire Barack Obama today went back to his core supporters to try to revive his flagging fortunes.

President Obama was expected to preview his ideas for job creation and economic growth in Detroit, Michigan, after world stock markets slumped.

But it turned into far more of a Democratic political rally, leaving him open to accusations of being short on important details and high on rhetoric.

Warm-up: Barack Obama was previewing his ideas for job creation and economic growth at a rally in Detroit after world stock markets slumped

Mr Obama, 50, even alluded to his first campaign slogan of 'yes we can', ahead of his vital jobs speech to Congress on Thursday.

The President's appearance follows 
last Friday's dismal jobs report, which showed employers added no jobs 
last month for the first time since 1945.

President Obama mentioned a speech made by Harry Truman in Detroit on Labor Day in 1948.

Mr Truman, right, had said the government managed to turn 'the greatest depression in history into the most prosperous era the country has ever seen'.

He talked of a 'danger...for those who do not belong to unions' and said there was 'much to hope for' from a Congress 'friendly to labour'.

Mr Obama said 'things haven't changed' and that the gains of labour will help U.S. prosperity.

Global stock markets also took a hit on 
Monday after the awful data that revived fears the world's largest 
economy is heading back into recession.

Supporters chanted 'four more years' before Mr Obama began speaking.

'This day belongs to you,' he told 
the labour union crowd. 'You've been working hard to make ends meet and 
build a better life for your kids.'

'We've gone through a difficult decade - where wealth was valued over work and greed was valued over responsibility,' he said.

'We've got a lot more work to do to recover fully from this recession. We've got to fully restore the middle class of America.

'There is work to be done and the workers to do it. We just need to get Congress on board. Let's get America back to work.'

He pushed for Republicans and Democrats 
to 'work together'. 'The time for Washington games is over,' he said. 
'The time for action is now.

'We've got a lot more work to do to recover fully from this recession. We've got to fully restore the middle class of America'

President Barack Obama

'We're fighting to give our kids a better life than we had' and for a system where 'everyone's got a shot at the American dream'.

Mr Obama insisted he will stand up for collective bargaining - and that every American has the right to have a voice in labour negotations.

'We are one nation - we are one people,' he said. 'I'm not scared of tough times because I know we're all going to be marching together.'

With a steady 9.1 per cent unemployment 
rate, he needs to help millions of jobless people back into work - and 
improve his re-election chances.

Public polls show the economy and jobs
are top concerns, with approval of Mr Obama's economic stewardship at a
new low of 26 per cent.

Mr
Obama’s GOP critics who are hoping to take him on for the 2012 
presidency have also been given fresh ammunition to use against him.

'(Mr Obama) is very mindful of what the 
needs and concerns are of those individuals who have been out of work 
for so long'

Labor Secretary Hilda Solis

Mitt Romney, set to unveil his own jobs 
plan on Tuesday, called the report unacceptable and ‘further proof that 
President Obama has failed’.

Mr Obama's plan is expected to include a combination of individual and business tax credits and public works spending.

Labor Secretary Hilda Solis said on Monday that both political parties should get behind Mr Obama's efforts to improve hiring.

Mr Obama ‘is very mindful of what the needs and concerns are of those individuals who have been out of work for so long’, she told NBC.

‘We need to focus like a laser beam on this right away,’ she told ABC.

Concerns: German traders monitor the DAX index board after a five per cent fall

Mr Obama spent part of the holiday weekend at Maryland's Camp David presidential retreat, ‘putting the finishing touches’ on proposals.

Meanwhile, oil prices extended losses to below $86 a barrel as the jobs data suggested a weak U.S. economy will lessen demand for crude.

European stocks tumbled four per cent on Monday, with banks plumbing a more-than two year low, as fears for the future of the euro zone intensified.

Britain's FTSE 100 dropped 3.6 per cent, Germany's DAX fell 5.3 per cent and France's CAC-40 toppled 4.7 per cent on a bad day for the markets.

It was the FTSE's second-biggest fall of the year, although its losses were smaller than Paris and Frankfurt's. U.S. markets are closed for Labor Day.

Japan's Nikkei 225 stock average sank 1.9 per cent to close at 8,784.46 as the Yen shows persistent strength, which hurts exporters.

Investors were staying out as 
expectations mounted the Federal Reserve would take action at its 
September meeting to support the U.S. economy.

Analysts said that a third round of bond purchases, dubbed quantitative easing III or QE3, could take place.

‘Right now the possibility has increased,’ said Linus Yip, a strategist at First Shanghai Securities in Hong Kong.

‘I think they have to do something. The markets are expecting QE3.’

The Dow Jones industrial average closed 2.2 per cent lower on Friday, wiping out its gain for the week, after the August jobs report.

It lost 253.31 points to close at 11,240.26 in its biggest fall for two weeks.

The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 2.5 per cent to 1,173.97 while the Nasdaq composite fell 2.6 per cent to 2,480.33.

'Obama will face a decidedly colder 
and more sceptical audience on Thursday, when he presents his jobs plan 
on the House floor - in front of the lawmakers he is increasingly 
decrying as obstructionist and out of touch.'(Zeke Miller, Business Insider)

'The rally at times felt like a campaign event, with enthusiastic supporters wearing Obama buttons and hats'(David Nakamura, Washington Post)

'The tone of the Labor Day speech indicates advisers inside the White House pushing for a jobs agenda to trump talk of debt and deficits have momentum going into Thursday's speech'(Ryan Grim, Huffington Post)

'Anyone who thinks Obama has lost his mojo should watch (the) Detroit speech. He had a godawful summer but only a naïf would underestimate this guy'(Jonathan Alter, Bloomberg)

'It was feisty and framed in part as a challenge to Republicans to join his jobs push and, as the President put it, to prove they care as much about the middle class as they say they do.'(Naftali Bendavid, Wall Street Journal)
