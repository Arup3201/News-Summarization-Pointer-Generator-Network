It seems everything in the technological world was bigger and better in 2014.

From ballooning smartphones to a tidal wave of Uber, it was the year to reap the benefits of an increasingly digitised age.

But with virtual reality beginning to make a splash and on-demand streaming just around the corner, what can we expect in 2015?

PHONES GET BIGGER

After Samsung paved the way with the 2011 Galaxy Note, competitors have followed suit with larger modelled smart phones

Initially dismissed as a fad, large-screened mobile phones are becoming the norm. Analysts thought Samsung had lost its marbles when it popped a 5.3-inch display on its 2011 Galaxy Note. This year's phones make that model look puny. Apple joined the phablet party with its 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus, while Google and Nokia went one better with 6-inch offerings. The extra screen space is better for games, videos, and heavy web-browsing. Analysts predict the trend will continue.

UBER DRIVES ON

Despite an increasingly controversial reputation, Uber continues to propser around the world

The car-hailing company accelerated its rollout, irking taxi operators and posing tough questions for regulators worldwide. Its app-based services reached Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Geelong and the Gold Coast this year after launching in Sydney and Melbourne in 2013. It's met opposition from regulators concerned about the safety of its ridesharing service, Uber X, which lets users book lifts in everyday cars. Uber ploughs on regardless and remains confident regulators will see the light.

BITCOIN AT A CROSSROADS

Despite the emergence of bitcoin ATMs and debit cards, the value of Bitcoin has not recovered from a suspected cyber-hack in February

The pre-eminent cryptocurrency was dealt a severe blow in February when the biggest exchange, Tokyo-based Mt Gox, collapsed after a suspected cyber attack. Bitcoin's value plummeted and hasn't recovered. It's now trading at about half its January high of about $US800 ($A865.57). Analysts remain concerned about security and the lack of regulation, but Australian entrepreneurs are keeping the faith. To try to take it mainstream, one company began rolling out bitcoin ATMs and another has launched a bitcoin debit card.

FACEBOOK WINS FRIENDS

This year saw Facebook bolster its position of utter dominance, reaching 1.35 billion monthly users

The world's premier social network bolstered its position of utter dominance. It has 1.35 billion monthly users at latest count, 64 per cent of whom use it daily. Third-quarter revenue grew 59 per cent from the same period in 2013 to reach $US3.2 billion ($A3.46 billion). Most of those dollars come from advertising to the mobile users marketers so dearly want to reach. CEO Mark Zuckerberg spooked investors with some wacky thoughts on future investments, but the business ends the year in excellent shape.

GLASS HALF EMPTY

Google glasses became a byword for intrusion, with the public uneasy that wearers could be covertly filming everything they see

This was meant to be the year Google took Glass, its pioneering head-mounted computer, mainstream. Instead, the company has gone quiet. The gadget has become a byword for intrusion, with the public uneasy that wearers could be covertly filming everything they see. Google has yet to put it on general sale, focusing instead on mobiles and smartwatches. App developers have likewise lost interest. Other companies such as Epson and Huawei are working on their own takes. If they can find a market for them, perhaps Google will revisit the technology.

- WHAT 2015 HOLDS -

WATCH THE WATCHES

Despite failing to crack the mainstream, the technology and software of smartwatches are rapidly improving

Smartwatches have been around for a while now. Samsung, LG, Sony and, most recently, Motorola, have all had a crack at the gadgets. But, bulky and geeky-looking, none has cracked the mainstream. That could change in 2015. The technology and software is improving and - crucially - they're beginning to look half decent. Apple's first attempt, revealed to much fanfare in September, is set to hit the market early in the year. The world's premier tech company has a knack for timing and rarely misreads the market, though it might take a couple of tweaks to get it right.

FROM A STREAM TO A FLOOD

After years of anticipation, Netflix confirmed in November  it will launch in Australia in March

Broadcast bosses can ignore it no longer: the future of TV is online, and 2015 is shaping as the tipping point. Netflix confirmed as much in November when it announced that it will launch in Australia in March. Foxtel has already slashed subscription prices in anticipation. Channel Nine and Fairfax Media have announced their own service, called Stan, while Channel Seven is expected to reveal its plans soon. These are in addition to local streaming services such as QuickFlix and EzyFlix. It's scary for the incumbents, but good news for Australians crying out for more choice.

VIRTUAL TO BECOME REALITY

Samsung and Google this year released impressive headsets that use smartphones for a virtual reality screen

Twenty years since its potential was first discussed, virtual reality is poised to hit the mainstream. Breakthroughs in 3D graphics and sensor technology have brought prices down to a palatable point for everyday consumers. Samsung and Google this year released impressive headsets that use smartphones for a screen. Next year, we can expect Sony's Project Morpheus, which will tie in with the PlayStation 4, and the pioneering Facebook-owned Oculus Rift. It raises new possibilities for immersive gaming and entertainment, but, like most new technologies, success will hinge on the appetite of app and game developers.

PAYMENTS GO MOBILE

In 2015, users will be able to store credit card information on new iPhones and tap-and-pay at registers

Tech companies haven't enjoyed much success in trying to nudge their way into in-store payments. That could begin to change in 2015 with the rollout of Apple Pay. Users will be able to store credit card information on new iPhones and tap-and-pay at registers, using the fingerprint scanner for verification. Early reviews from the US have praised the system's ease of use. Deloitte research suggests only about a third of Australians are prepared to use their phone as a payment device, but analysts suggest this percentage will grow. Trust is the biggest issue. The entry of a company of Apple's prestige could be a game changer.

TABLET WITHDRAWAL

It's believed that Tablet sales, which slowed to 7.2 per cent this year, will continue to dwindle in the coming year

Tablet growth slowed to 7.2 per cent this year - a dramatic fall from the 52.5 per cent of 2013, according to market-tracker IDC. There is little sign things will pick up in 2015. Tablets are being squeezed as phones get bigger. People also tend to hold onto them for a year or two longer than they do smartphones. iPad sales are predicted to flatline, with Windows and Android tablets faring slightly better. Apple left its iPad Mini practically unchanged this year, suggesting it could soon be shelved. Forrester researchers expect Apple to launch an iPad about the 13-inch mark to compete with hybrid laptop-tablets such as Microsoft's Surface Pro 3.
