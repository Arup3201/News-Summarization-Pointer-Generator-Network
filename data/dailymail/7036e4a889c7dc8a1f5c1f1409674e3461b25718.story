Maverick midfielder Ravel Morrison has posted a picture of himself striking a unique pose on his official Instagram account.

The 22-year-old, who was released from last his last contract at West Ham following a series of disciplinary problems, is currently training with Serie A side Lazio ahead of a planned summer move. 

Morrison signed a pre-contract agreement with the Rome-based outfit in January, but was unable to make his debut for them this season, because of a delay in squad registration.

 Morrison was released from his last contract at West Ham following a string of disciplinary problems

He started his career at Manchester United and was once compared by Sir Alex Ferguson to legendary Red Devils midfielder Paul Scholes. 

However, for all Morrison's precocious talent, he found himself consistently involved in off-field dramas. In February 2011, he pleaded guilty to witness intimidation and was fined £600 three months later for throwing his girlfriend's phone through an open window during an argument. 

By the summer of 2012, Ferguson had seemingly had enough of Morrison's antics and he was allowed to join West Ham. 

But at Upton Park, the problems persisted and Morrison was fined £7000 by the FA for writing an allegedly homophobic Tweet shortly after signing. 

Following only a handful of first-team appearances and some loan spells at Birmingham, QPR and Cardiff, Morrison had his Hammers contract terminated.
