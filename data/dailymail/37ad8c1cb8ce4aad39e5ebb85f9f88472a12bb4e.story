A man who blew up his house when his 
girlfriend left him, killing his neighbours’ two-year-old boy, was 
jailed for ten years yesterday.

Unemployed joiner Andrew Partington, 
28, sawed through gas pipes then sent his girlfriend a text message 
warning ‘gas pipe cut, already filled up, boom’.

The following morning, Partington lit a
cigarette, igniting the gas and causing a huge explosion. Toddler Jamie
Heaton, who had been watching his favourite television programme, Peppa
Pig, was killed next door.

His distraught mother Michelle escaped injury only because she was outside hanging up washing.

A passing policeman crawled through the rubble to reach Jamie, but he had already been crushed to death.

Partington was pulled from the 
wreckage of his house in Shaw, near Oldham, with 40 per cent burns and a
broken back. He admitted manslaughter.

Jailing him at Manchester Crown Court,
Mr Justice Hamblen said his reckless actions had in effect produced ‘a 
bomb that you created and detonated’, killing Jamie and wrecking the 
lives of his parents.

Afterwards Mrs Heaton and her car 
salesman husband Kenny, 37, said: ‘No sentence imposed would ever bring 
Jamie back nor would it ever give us satisfaction.’

The court heard Andrew Partington (left) and Tanya Williams had a stormy relationship

Jamie, who had been diagnosed with 
autism, should have been at nursery on the day of the blast last June 
but was poorly. Mrs Heaton, 32, stayed home from her job at Boots to 
look after him.

Hard-drinking Partington and his 
girlfriend, Tanya Williams, had moved in four months before the blast.

He regularly beat her and shortly before the explosion had been given a 
conditional discharge for common assault. Miss Williams, 28, has five 
children, the two youngest by Partington, who has a daughter from a 
previous relationship.

On June 25, the court heard, 
Partington had been drinking heavily and rowed with Miss Williams, 
calling her ‘fat’ and ‘ugly’.

She left, taking the children. Partington 
bombarded her with angry messages from his BlackBerry phone.

One read: ‘Told you next time you 
leave me, house goes up with me. You left your kids with no Dad, no 
home, goodbye, boom, gas pipe cut, already filled up, boom.’ He also 
called her a ‘bitch’ and said he loved his two sons by her.

Partington, who had cut the gas pipes in two places, then apparently fell into a drunken stupor.

The following morning, the defence claimed, he changed his mind, turned off the gas and opened windows.

National Grid was alerted to the leak 
after a neighbour reporting a smell of gas at 10.42am. Engineers were 
minutes from the scene when at about 11.15am Partington lit a cigarette,
causing the catastrophic explosion that police said left the street 
‘like a war zone’. It was ‘sheer luck’ that no one else was killed or 
seriously injured.

The external wall of Partington’s 
end-of-terrace home was torn from its foundations, slamming into the 
Heatons’ house, from which it was separated by an alley, and causing the
roof to cave in.

Mrs Heaton told how her first thought was that her son
would be terrified by the deafening blast.

‘I knew Jamie would be frightened, but I couldn’t get back in the back door,’ she said.

The Heatons – who also have a son, 
Jack, nine, and daughter Jodie, five – said of Jamie: ‘He was a 
beautiful, healthy and loving little boy who was full of life. Above all
he was great fun.

Kenny and Michelle Heaton arrive at Manchester Crown Court for the trial of gas fitter Andrew Partington. The couple's son Jamie died in a gas explosion at their home in Oldham last year

‘The fact that [the explosion] was deliberate and totally avoidable has made the grieving ever harder to manage.’

They have set up a charity, Jamie’s Something Special, in his memory to raise funds for children’s play equipment.

Several other families lost homes and 
possessions in the blast, which damaged seven houses beyond repair and 
left an estimated bill of £1.2million.

A fund to support victims of the blast has so far paid out £207,000 to 91 households.

Partington admitted eight charges of destroying houses and received concurrent seven-year sentences for each.

Mr Justice Hamblen accepted that he had not deliberately ignited the gas.
