One Wisconsin town dealing with frozen waterways and clogged drains caused by melted snow has tried an explosive new approach: blowing up a creek.

Town of Onalaska officials hired a blasting company to stick several hundred sticks of plastic explosives in the frozen Sand Lake Coulee Creek and detonate it.

Officials
 turned to explosives after a February 23 downpour which caused the water to run on the ice and around a dike that protects about a dozen homes.

officials used dynamite instead

Town of Onalaska Chairman Rolly 
Bogert said the board approached lawmakers and the Department of Natural Resources for permits to break up the ice.

'That fractured the ice out and the explosions took what ice 
came out straight up in the air and came back down. There's no debris 
outside of the creek bed,' he told news8000.com.

After the blast, crews dug out the ice and created a channel for the 
water. No homes in the area were damaged in the blast.

Jerry McManigle says in 50 years in the business, he's blown up barns, foundations and beaver dams - but never a creek.
