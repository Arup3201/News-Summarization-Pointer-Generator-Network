The developer behind 2013’s hottest mobile app has revealed the secrets to his success.

Plain Vanilla CEO Thor Fridriksson’s QuizUp is a runaway success that has overtaken the Apple App Store’s games charts and has over 3.5million registered users only three weeks since being released.

QuizUp is a trivia game modeled after TrivialPursuit that allows people to compete in specific categories against friends or anyone else around the world. Mr Fridriksson detailed his creative process to New York Magazine.

The most important key to any app is 
to build on an existing idea, the San Francisco-based executive said, explaining that games 
such as Words With Friends and Draw Something took an offline game and 
made it addictive.

QuizUp’s success comes from its simplicity. Mr Fridriksson designed the game to be simple and intuitive, but also familiar.

‘Having
 gameplay that’s familiar to you is a huge advantage, because you can 
get right into the game,’ he explained. ‘We don’t have an onboarding 
mechanism. You just start.’

Once
 gamers have opened the app they can just select a category and begin 
answering questions. There are no gimmicks like other games commonly 
have, just trivia.

‘You get
 to a level, it’s addicting, but in order to continue you need to share 
it or ask your friends for help,’ the Iceland native said about smash 
success Candy Crush Saga.

Exclusivity: The app is currently only available on iPhones, which Mr Fridriksson believes has contributed to its success

‘We are trying to do the exact opposite,’ he explained. ‘We don’t really reward people at all for sharing.’

If the game's success has been simple and sudden, Fridriksson's rise to fame has not been.

Rather than some overnight success, the tech entrepreneur studied at Oxford University before working his way up through various leading telecommunication firms.

And selling his trivia plan wasn't a walk in the park either.

'It… wasn’t easy,' he told techcrunch. 'I thought I’d just charm my way in front of these VCs, share my big idea for a quiz platform, and they’d throw money my way. Not quite.'

'Just connecting with the right people was a challenge. I’d cold call and ask for meetings, and they’d maybe be willing to set something up for 2, 3 months later. I had to be creative to get in front of these VCs. It maybe even bordered on stalking. In hindsight, maybe it was a bit creepy.'

Since it's launch on November 7 QuizUP has signed more than 1.5 million users playing more than 70 million games - quickly dominating Apple's download charts. 

Players soon start ramping up 
experience points (XP) and begin ranking in their city or state in 
specific categories and post those achievements online.

Those postings are what has led to the game’s remarkable organic growth.

‘Most
 of the new players are coming through Facebook and Twitter shares,’ Mr 
Fridriksson explained. ‘They’re proud of being No. 1 in their state in 
botany, or something.’

Beautiful simplicity: THe game is easy to use and intuitive

The latest mobile app mastermind also learned a lesson from other successful apps, don’t fragment.

Developers are not releasing multiple
 versions of the game, they have instead provided users the ability to 
upload their own questions to the game from within the app.

There are over 200,000 currently in the app, but that number grows daily.

Comparison: Players can compare their performance against friends and others

‘You have to be able to constantly refresh content,’ said Mr Fridriksson.

Having the app only on iPhones has also made it successful, according to the executive.

‘It's made it a kind of status symbol,’ he said. ‘If there’s one person in a school or university who gets the game, there are twenty the next day, and the next day, everyone who has an iPhone has it.'

An android version is coming next month, New York Magazine noted.

The firm with just 30 employees now has $1.2million in venture funding and have made the gamble to drop all their other projects to purely focus on Quizup.

'We’ve evolved from being a game studio that has multiple titles into 
just being QuizUp,' he told the magazine although admitting he knows 
trends can be fickle.

'It’s every man’s dream to have a hit product. Enjoy the ride.'

The game also doesn’t try to force players to open their wallets to generate income like many other games do, it instead partners with brands for sponsored categories.

The final piece to the success puzzle was making it a quasi-social network.

Each category has its own message board that users can have discussions about various topics on.

Mr Fridriksson readily admitted to the magazine that some of the discussions are ‘just noise’ but also said topics like physics have ‘really intellectual discussions.’
