Neil Lennon would be interested in switching Celtic for Norwich City – but only if a concrete offer was on the table.

Norwich are on the lookout for a new permanent manager, with Neil Adams expected to return to his academy role despite wanting a full-time crack at the job.

And even though Lennon could have another season of Champions League football, it is believed he would be open to new challenges south of the border even in the Championship.

Stepped down: Neil Adams is likely to return to his role in the Norwich academy following the club's relegation

Chief executive David McNally knows Lennon from their time together at Celtic and the 42-year-old is on Norwich’s shortlist. Sportsmail first reported the interest in January.

Striker Gary Hooper would also be more inclined to stay with Lennon, who managed him for three years at Parkhead, in charge at Carrow Road. Hooper signed for Norwich for £5million last summer.

Lennon, who has won three Scottish titles and two Scottish Cups in the last four years, said last week that he retains a healthy and open dialogue with chief executive Peter Lawwell and Irish major shareholder Dermot Desmond.

‘There’s going to be a bit of to-ing and fro-ing over the next few weeks,’ Lennon said. ‘When I’m asked I say I am pretty happy where I am. I’m pretty stable.

‘There has been no offer, there has been no concrete phonecall or anything like that, so I haven’t really had a decision to make on it.’

Malky Mackay has been linked and is free from litigation having dropped his claim for compensation against Cardiff City but he would prefer to remain in the Premier League.
