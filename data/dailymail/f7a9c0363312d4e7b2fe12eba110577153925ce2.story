A teacher has been arrested and suspended following allegations from pupils that he tickled and sniffed primary school children's feet.

The staff member was held on suspicion of 'assault by touching', and four young boys have been quizzed over the allegations by officers.

Parents said they were stunned when they heard police had been called to the school, in Blackburn, Lancashire, on Tuesday.

They were then contacted and told to come into school for a meeting, in which they were told their children had been ordered by the suspect to remove their shoes and socks in lessons.

One parent said her son told her had been made to remove his footwear and sit on a desk. Children then had to play 'a game' in which they were told to go barefoot and chose a card.

Children's feet were then either 'tickled or sniffed by the staff member' depending on which card they chose.

The suspect has suspended and an investigation has been launched by Blackburn with Darwen Council.

One mother said: 'I didn't know anything about this and was called into school to be told my son had been questioned by police.

'I am deeply concerned and I feel everyone should know what has been happening so it can be properly looked into. This is so confusing for children.

'My son said he was picked up and put on a table, his shoes and socks taken off. Then he had to pick a card saying tickle or sniff. How can under-tens make any sense of that?'

Another parent said: 'It's just really worrying to me. My daughter wasn't one of the kids questioned, but I am just as concerned as those parents are. The kids think it is all a game but I think it needs looking into.'

Because of the 2011 Education Act 
which came into force last year, the staff member or the school where 
the incidents allegedly took place cannot be identified.

The
 authority's education councillor Dave Harling said: 'The school has 
responded swiftly and robustly to the concerns and will be conducting an
 internal investigation.

'In addition, the matter has been reported to police and is currently being investigated.

'I
 understand that the community will naturally be concerned about this 
matter, but I'd like to appeal to people not to speculate while we await
 the outcome of the investigations.'

A
 spokesman for Lancashire Police said: 'We have been contacted by the 
local authority in relation to a complaint about a member of staff at 
the school.

'While we are in
 the very early stages of an investigation, we have spoken to a number 
of people and we are determining whether any criminal offences have been
 committed.

'A man has been arrested and has been bailed pending further enquiries.'
