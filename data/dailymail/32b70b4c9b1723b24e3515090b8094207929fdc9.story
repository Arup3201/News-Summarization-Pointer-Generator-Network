A World War I-era house frozen in time from 100 years ago has gone on sale, complete with bedpans, outdoor toilet and a wireless.

The Paddington home in inner-city Sydney, has been kept by one family since 1915 and is still completely in its original condition, having never been renovated.

The Victorian home on 6 Broughton Street could be one of the last examples of the suburb's early 'workers cottages' and comes complete with an Arnotts biscuit tin and a fly swatter.

Nestled on a laneway amongst renovated cottages, the house is easy to bypass but inside it is hidden with historic gems. 

There are also a huge fly swatter next to the old-fashioned stove and vintage furniture adorns the house. A modern refrigerator has been added to the house.

In the two-bedroom house, two ornate dressing tables sit in the corner of the master bedroom, along with bedpans and a fireplace. 

A combined laundry-bathroom-kitchen complete with the double wash tub and hot water cooper fill up the bathroom area 

Outside, two paths run parallel down the garden. A little outdoor toilet is as the bottom of the garden, near the laneway

A kettle sits on the stove in the bathroom and a dresser features towels and jugs which would have been used for washing in that era.

The house is open for inspection starting from February 25th and will go on auction on March 17th

The grass is withered but the time capsule house is well-kept and nothing is overgrown. 

It is expected that the house will sell for well over $1 million. A similar house in Paddington, which hadn't been touched in 40 years sold for over $2.5 million in 2013.  

The house is open for inspection starting from February 25th and will go on auction on March 17th. 

Bradfield Cleary auctioneers believe the 'home offers a truly unique and exciting opportunity to capitalise in one of the east's most sought-after locations'.
