When it comes to cross-Channel relations, it is perhaps fair to say that the French are as fond of us as we are of them.

But in case there was any lingering doubt that relations just might thaw ahead of the Olympics, you should take a look at these images first.

They are part of a Eurostar poster advertising campaign to encourage the French to take the high-speed train to London 2012.

Sacre bleu! This cheeky Eurostar poster features a spoof Greek statue of naked men pursuing popular pub sports

The posters, which were created by a 
French ad agency, invert the usually athletic form of ancient Greek 
statues to portray Les Rosbifs as pot-bellied, beer-swilling slobs with a
 penchant for pub games.

Two portly actors were recruited to 
model for the job, in which the ‘sculptures’ were created in digital 3D 
and based on photographs.

Far from displaying a chiselled physique, the figures appear to carry more than a little weight around the belly.

Instead of holding the discus or 
crouching in athletic pose, one clutches a snooker cue while the other 
holds a dart. Last night, Leg, the agency behind the ads, insisted they 
were in good fun and a ‘homage to English popular culture’.

The posters are aimed at attracting the French to take the high speed train to London 2012 - possibly to poke fun at our Olympic aspirations

The ads were designed by Paris ad agency Leg with whom part British-owned games sponsor Eurostar has been working for more than a decade

Its previous creations for the campaign included a redesign of a British banknote showing Mr Bean in a tiara.

Former West End star Howard Crossley was one of the actors used in the latest campaign.

Unmasked as the pot-bellied snooker 
player, the 59-year-old ex-Royal Shakespeare Company actor said: ‘I’m 
not in the best of shape these days but that’s obviously what they were 
looking for. I am what they think is a typical middle-aged Englishman 
whose idea of sport is drinking beer and playing snooker.

‘I knew roughly what the idea was and that it was the French’s idea of a joke.’

Leg president Gabriel Gaultier 
insisted the Eurostar adverts have been universally well received. He 
added: ‘The public awaits the next ads religiously, wondering “what will
 they think up next?”’

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the advertisements do not appear in England.

Eurostar said the campaign was ‘a tongue-in cheek campaign playing on the age-old Franco-British rivalry’.
