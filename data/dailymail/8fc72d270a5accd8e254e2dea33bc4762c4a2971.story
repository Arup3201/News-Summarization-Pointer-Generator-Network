So when did you think Brazil would crumble on home territory at this World Cup? Was it when Croatia took a shock lead in Sao Paulo to stun the hosts on their big opening night? What about when Mexico keeper Guillermo Ochoa kept everything fired at him out, or even when Cameroon equalised in the final group game?

There was of course when Chile hit the crossbar with victory in sight during the dying stages of Brazil’s last 16 clash, while local nerves were shredded after Colombia pulled a goal back late on in the quarter-finals.

Brazil, of course, pulled through – they always do. No one should be surprised because keeping the Selecao pinned in their own back yard when it matters most is something no team has done for an incredible 39 years.

Luiz Felipe Scolari’s outfit line up against Germany in a World Cup semi-final on Tuesday and aside from looking for a place in the Rio final, Brazil will be hoping to protect a streak which has seen no team beat them at home in a competitive international since 1975.

That long lasting run which spans 63 games is surely facing one of its biggest threats when Germany turn up for battle.

Brazil will be without star forward Neymar through injury, while captain Thiago Silva is suspended for the clash with Joachim Low’s outfit – who in Belo Horizonte will surely prove to be one of the biggest credible threats to the streak during those 39 years.

As fate has it, it’s Belo Horizonte where this particular story starts.

In the very same Estadio Mineirao (albeit with a bit of revamp work these days) where Germany will look to upset the locals, Peru did the very same back on September 30, 1975.

Two goals in the final eight minutes helped them see off Brazil 3-1 in a first-leg Copa America semi-final, a tie they would eventually win before going on to lift the trophy.

It was a Brazil team in transition – still a good side – but missing key men from the 1970 World Cup winning team as well as proving slightly too early for the class of 1982.

Expectation: Brazil expect their national team to emerge victorious on home soil and lift the World Cup

The likes of Pele, Carlos Alberto and Jairzinho had all moved on, while the crop of Socrates, Zico and Falcao had yet to come through.

Typically Brazil remained competitive during this period. The 1974 and 1978 World Cups rewarded fourth and third place finishes respectively, while Selecao also recorded two semi-final appearances in the Copa America.

For all their undoubted improvement in class, even the stars of ’82 failed to match any of the 1970s performances, while the 1986 side fared little better as beaten quarter-finalists in Mexico.

A year later, the Copa America format changed to allow a host nation to stage all the games, but Brazil were soon under pressure on home soil again when they hosted the tournament in 1989.

A less than vintage team stormed to victory unbeaten during the campaign and conceded just one goal in the process. Home soil seemed to get the very best out of them because a last 16 exit at Italia ‘90 a year later was their worst World Cup performance since a group stage exit in 1966.

The build up to the 1994 World Cup provided another setback, but only away from home as Brazil lost their first ever World Cup qualifier when Bolivia scored twice in the final two minutes to record a famous 2-0 win in 1993.

Losing the odd qualifier then became regular for Brazil but none were on their territory. Even the side that limped into the 2002 World Cup that suffered a record six defeats were bullet proof on home turf.

Last year’s Confederations Cup was another home obstacle easily overcome with five straight victories.

These are not poor teams that Brazil are playing against neither. Argentina, Colombia and Uruguay are for instance regular visitors but simply cannot get the job done in Brazil’s backyard, while European champions Italy and world champions Spain also offered little resistance.

In an even bigger sign of what’s to come, it’s not just competitive games where Brazil are so strong at home.

The South Americans are unbeaten in their last 42 international matches on home soil in all games, since losing 1-0 in a friendly match in Fortaleza against Paraguay in August 2002.

Germany’s chances of ending this formidable home streak are arguably higher for them than it has been for any other team during this 39-year period.

But they will need to find something extra in the tank to slay a Brazil side who somehow, someway, always stop their opponents from leaving their country with all the glory.
