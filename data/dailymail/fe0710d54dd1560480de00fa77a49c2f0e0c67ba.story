They have a reputation for faultless efficiency and planning events with meticulous detail.

So perhaps we should be worried that Germans already believe London 2012 will be an 'Olympic-sized disaster'.

Germany's leading news magazine has launched an attack on Britain’s preparations for the Olympics, poking fun at facilities and warning that the Games are destined to go down in history as a gigantic 'soggy mess'.

Provocative: A German magazine article has poked fun at Britain's preparations for the Games, warning we can expect an 'Olympic-sized disaster'

Venue: An aerial photograph of the Olympic stadium in Stratford, east London. Germans say it will host a 'soggy mess'

The article in Der Spiegel trashes numerous aspects about the Games, from the 'clattering' Tube system that will transport most spectators to Olympic venues to pavements that are 'too narrow' and a passport control situation at Heathrow bordering on chaotic.

'London and the Olympic Games are clearly not made for each other,' it said.

'Visitors will need determination and, most of all, patience to reach the venues at all. And, for the locals, it all can’t end soon enough.'

Controversial: The article appeared in this edition of Der Spiegel, Germany's leading news magazine

The article claims that the Olympics, which will run from July 27 to August 12, will be an 'arduous obstacle course for everyone'.

'Starting this week, the world’s biggest financial centre will be gripped by a special condition usually only seen in wartime,' it reads.

'Its 7.8million inhabitants are about to be joined by an average of 1million additional visitors per day.

'The already overloaded public-transportation system will be burdened with an additional 3 million fares per day.

'A total of 109 miles of the city’s streets will be closed off to normal traffic.

'Almost twice as many soldiers as Britain has in Afghanistan, a helicopter carrier and special forces units armed to the teeth will make the city look like it’s under siege.'

The Germans, whose last efforts at 
hosting the Olympic Games saw Israeli athletes murdered in Munich in a 
security fiasco in 1972, then criticise an aspect beyond our control - the weather.

It reads: 'And then there’s England’s classic bad weather, which has some wondering whether the Summer Games will turn into a fiasco.

'The weather has been cold, wet and gloomy since the spring, with last month proving to be the wettest June on record.

'The meteorologists’ Olympic forecasts are nothing short of dismal: rain, rain and, yes, more rain. And it won’t just be falling on the athletes, but also on the most highest-priced seats in the Olympic Stadium.

 3 The number of times London has held the Olympic Games (1908, 1948 and 2012)

30 New bridges built inside the Olympic Park in Stratford, east London

200 Number of buildings that had to be demolished to accommodate the site

587 Acreage of Olympic Park

3,000 Square footage of world's biggest McDonald's - just 200 yards from stadium

200,000 Total workforce needed

700,000 Total capacity for all venues

4billion People expected to watch the Opening Ceremony

9.3billion cost in pounds sterling of staging the Games

'Optimistic planners decided not to cover those seats, unlike the rest of them.'

The long and rambling article takes aim at many features of British life, even making fun of child obesity.

'And the children? They haven’t become athletes, either,' it states.

'On the contrary, the boys and girls of the British Isles are among the fattest in the European Union.

'London’s poor East End now has an Olympic Park and the largest shopping centre in the EU -- but it’s still poor.'

The
article finishes: 'Though London has many natural gifts, they aren’t of
the kind that makes it ideal to host such a major event.

'And because Great Britain is both a 
debt-ridden and democratic country, it wasn’t possible to radically 
reshape London for the event, as the Chinese did with Beijing in 2008.

'The
2012 London Olympics will probably end up looking like the host city 
itself: a little chaotic, a little infuriating, never perfect, but with a
lot of room for improvisation, charm and talent.

'Those who live there will be delighted, of course, but only once it’s over.'
