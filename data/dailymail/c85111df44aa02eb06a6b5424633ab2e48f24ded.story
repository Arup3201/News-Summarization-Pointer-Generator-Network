Georgia fear they will have to play September's Euro 2016 qualifier with Scotland behind closed doors.

Sunday's 2-0 defeat by Germany in Tbilisi was twice interrupted by supporters invading the Boris Paichadze Stadium pitch.

The Georgian Football Federation has vowed to tighten up security in the wake of those crowd disturbances.

But in a statement posted on its website, it also admits to concerns that UEFA will decide to shut the stadium for the September 4 meeting with Gordon Strachan's side.

European football's governing body has yet to announce if it will be opening disciplinary proceedings against the GFF although it has launched investigations into Friday night's clash between Montenegro and Russia, which was abandoned midway through the second half after a brawl between players. Russian goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev had earlier been struck by a flare.

Scotland currently sit third in Group D, a point behind leaders Poland. Georgia are fifth, with just one win from five games.
