The Montana Supreme Court has ordered the reinstatement of charges against a married mother first charged with repeatedly fabricating false rape claims in 2012.

Prosecutors believe Christina Nadine Nelson, 23, of Billings made several false rape or assault claims between 2009 and 2012.

The charges had been dismissed last July by Judge G. Todd Baugh, but last week the state’s supreme court overruled his decision and ordered a reinstatement of the accusations.

Christina Nadine Nelson, 23, of Billings will face trial after the Montana Supreme Court ruled that there was sufficient evidence to prosecute her over repeatedly fabricating false rape claims

The justices ruled that there is sufficient evidence to let a jury decide the case, reports the Billings Gazette.

The first accusation against Nelson dates back to 2009, when she said she was raped on her way to prom.

Nelson, a foreign exchange student from Germany, was a student at Columbia Falls High School.

She claimed her prom date raped her and cut her with a knife, but detectives found inconsistencies with her statements. An investigation found she suffered no cuts on the night of her prom.

When detectives asked if there was blood on her prom dress from the cuts, Nelson told them there was blood but she had washed it off.

It is unknown if Nelson, a married mother, is in Billings or if she has returned to Germany, where she was born

A month after the prom, Nelson stated she wanted to drop the charges against her date.

After her initial rape report, the boy was expelled from school and not allowed to return to campus.

'He moved out of state because he felt that his reputation was destroyed by Christina's allegations,' court documents state.

In 2012, Nelson claimed she was raped by her ex-boyfriend. She said he approached her in the parking lot of her workplace and hit her repeatedly before forcing her into the back of his van and raping her.

Nelson said after the assault, she went to a bar to have a drink with a friend, before going to the gym with her husband.

After having intercourse with her husband later that night, Nelson told him about the rape. He took her to Billings Clinic for an exam.

But when detectives reviewed parking lot surveillance footage from that night, they found no evidence to substantiate her claims.

Video showed Nelson walking from her workplace to her car and driving away. Detectives also learned that her ex-boyfriend was out of town on the night she claimed he raped her.

Between 2009 and 2012 a total of five medical rape exams were conducted on Nelson and she made two reports of assault.

'Christina had a motive or pattern of accusing young men that she had dated of raping her and assaulting her when no such rape or assault had occurred,' prosecutors state in court documents.

It is unknown if Nelson is in Billings or if she has returned to Germany, where she was born.

After Baugh dismissed the case, Nelson was allowed to travel out of the country.
