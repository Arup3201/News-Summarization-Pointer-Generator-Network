Double standards: Inspector Mohammed Razaq, 52, was responsible for evicting anti-social tenants - but his own property was the scene of drinking, violence and drug-taking

A senior policeman who ran a 'zero tolerance' crackdown on nightmare tenants owned a house that became notorious for wild parties, drug taking and violence.

While Inspector Mohammed Razaq, 52, was fighting to evict thugs from a council estate in Bolton, Greater Manchester, his ten-bedroom house five miles away had descended into chaos.

Neighbours created a dossier of 49 incidents in which drunken tenants at the Victorian townhouse had thrown bricks at them in the street and jumped up and down on cars.

One recalled how feral dogs belonging to the 'house from hell' would roam the street and an occasion when a woman threatened to throw herself from the second floor.

Meanwhile, Insp Razaq was acting as a figurehead for a major police operation attempting to reduce anti-social behaviour including street drinking and vandalism.

Now the Asbo laws he uses on his own beat have been called upon to have his house in Higher Broughton, near Salford, boarded up and the tenants moved on.

A neighbour said today: 'Closing down that house will give us our first good nights sleep for several years.

'He may have been been the public face 
of policing anti social behaviour on his beat but it is an absolute 
disgrace that he can’t keep his own house in order - literally.

'There were always late night parties 
going on there and at one time there was a woman threatening to jump 
from the second floor. They had feral dogs roaming around the 
neighbourhood and attacking other animals.

'At times the tenants themselves would 
jump on my car and throw bricks out the window. It was a house from hell
- and I find it unbelievable it is owned by a senior police officer who
should know better.'

Insp Razaq - one of Britain’s longest serving Asian officers and known as 'Mo' - has more than 33 years experience, including spells in CID, Tactical Aid, a firearms unit and on community cohesion projects.

During the 1980s, he helped to police the Toxteth riots, and was part of the team which escorted the Moors Murderer Myra Hindley back to the Saddleworth Moor to locate victims’ bodies.

He was eventually put in charge of policing the Johnson Fold estate in Bolton, where he introduced extra high visibility police patrols and more CCTV surveillance. Groups of youths were regularly stopped and asked to account for what they were doing.

His use of dispersal orders helped cut anti-social behaviour in the area by a third. Insp Razaq was a regular at local area meetings and warned that problem tenants would be thrown out of their homes if they repeatedly brought misery to the community.

After one eviction, Insp Razaq, who lives in the Great Lever area of Bolton, said: 'There has been a lot of anti-social behaviour, alcohol-fuelled problems and this house was the focal point.

'We’re sending out a strong message that if people engage in anti-social behaviour they can expect low-levels of tolerance from the police. We will do all we can to resolve the problem and if that means evicting people, then so be it.'

Black-spot: The ten-bedroom house was boarded up by the council after neighbours recorded almost 50 incidents of trouble from tenants

But Insp Razaq had problems at his own property, for which his son Usman holds the landlord licence.

Manchester City Magistrates' Court was told of almost 50 incidents involving tenants of the house between July last year and June this year.

They included loud music being played at night, foul language, fights and repeated thefts from neighbours’ houses and the local shop. A dog from the house also mauled a passer-by.

Salford City Council won a three-month closure order on the house after their legal application was supported by Insp Razaq’s colleagues at Greater Manchester Police.

They said the property had a 'high turnover' of tenants and issues dated back to 2009.

A council spokesman said: 'The Anti-Social Behaviour Team received reports of residents and their guests drinking at the front of the property, shouting, arguing, fighting, shop lifting from the local shop and even stealing from other residents at the address.

'There were also reports of rubbish being dumped around the property, dogs allowed to roam around and on one occasion of a dog attacking a passer-by.

'A meeting was called with all tenants to warn them of the implications of their behaviour.

Serious problem: Magistrates heard that rubbish was dumped outside the house and neighbours' homes were burgled

'When none of the tenants attended, Anti-Social Behaviour Officers then tried to work with the owner of the property to resolve the problem, but when this failed they took the decision to apply for a closure order.'

Salford deputy mayor David Lancaster said: 'A trouble-making group of residents like this can terrorise a local community.

'In this particular case, local residents were left feeling threatened and unsafe in their own community, which is absolutely unacceptable.

'The work the Anti-Social Behaviour Team has done will move these individuals out of this house, meaning they can no longer pose a threat to this area. I hope this will also make the tenants see the error of their ways and make sure there is not a repeat of this behaviour in future.'

The case is the first time an Asbo has been served on a property in Greater Manchester rather than an individual.

Insp Razaq said he had been the victim of a ‘witch hunt’ on the evidence of just one witness. He said he and his son had fully complied with everything council officers had asked of them.

Insp Razaq is currently suspended on full pay from his post after being arrested in May 2011 on suspicion of unrelated allegations of corruption and fraud.

He was cleared of any wrongdoing on duty but was charged with six offences of fraud and three offences under the Proceeds of Crime Act relating to insurance and mortgage fraud.

It is alleged he exaggerated insurance claims following flood damage at his house and secured a mortgage at a lower rate by failing to disclose that he was buying to let.

He will 'strenuously' deny all charges and is awaiting trial.
