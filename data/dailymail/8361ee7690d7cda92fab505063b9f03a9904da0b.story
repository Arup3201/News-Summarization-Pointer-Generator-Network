Manchester United have warned fans that if they do not buy a ticket for their FA Cup replay with Cambridge United they will have their season tickets suspended.

The club have written to those who have not yet paid out for the televised fourth-round clash with the League Two side and told them that if they do not do so they will not be allowed entry to their Premier League home fixture against Sunderland.

United operate a system in which season card holders agree to buy additional tickets for cup matches - although there are opt outs for Capital One Cup games and under 16s can opt out of FA Cup matches.

Those that do not incur an automatic one-match suspension.

The club say that fans are made aware of this before they buy season cards and by doing so they agree to the rules.

But one fan told Sportsmail he is considering boycotting both the Cambridge and Sunderland matches.

Card details given by Sam Stonier to United at the start of the season expired recently meaning they were unable to take payment for the Cambridge match.

As a result the club emailed the supporter and told him that he had until the end of Wednesday to shell out - or be banned.

Sam, a 30-year-old database analyst from Levenshulme, Manchester, raged: 'I find it unbelievable that the club think they can treat loyal supporters like myself that spend thousands with them like this - sending an email making threats and setting deadlines.

'This isn’t the first time this has happened and I’m sure it won’t be the last. I’m sick to death of having emails like this.

'To be honest I would be willing to miss both the Cambridge and Sunderland games as a matter of principle.'

United declined to reduce prices for the match, which will take place on Tuesday following a 0-0 draw at the Abbey Stadium.

Manchester United season ticket holders have been told they must by a ticket or have their card suspended

That will mean many face the prospect of forking out more than £50 to see Louis van Gaal's side take on fourth-tier opponents.

A United spokesman said: 'We notify fans that failure to pay for a game in the cup scheme would mean a suspension from the next game.

'The terms and conditions are clear: “in respect of each home cup match for which the Ticket Holder fails to provide valid payment card details or for which the Ticket Holder’s card or payment is declined, the Ticket Holder’s Season Ticket may be suspended for one home league match.

'This measure was introduced at the start of the season before last. If we successfully sell the ticket the fan has failed to pay for, they can apply for a refund of the Sunderland ticket at the end of the season.'
