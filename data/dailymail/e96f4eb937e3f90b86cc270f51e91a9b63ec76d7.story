With 17 whiplash accidents in eight years, Mohammed Saeed might have been considered the unluckiest motorist in Britain.

But after hearing details of a recent compensation claim, a judge decided the 30-year-old may really be an unscrupulous fraudster riding the ‘crash for cash’ bandwagon.

And in an unprecedented move, Judge Simon Brown QC ordered a perjury inquiry into the previous payout bids of the serial claimant and his gang, who may have made thousands of pounds from 23 ‘bogus’ accidents.

Persistent claims: Saeed's claims were brought to light when a claim that he was in a car hit by a National Express coach (file picture), was challenged by the firm

Saeed and three other people alleged they were in a parked car in March 2011 when it was hit by a National Express bus.

The motorist said he pulled the bus over several miles down the road and told the bemused driver he had damaged his vehicle.

However, investigations revealed the damage to the car couldn’t have been done by the bus and National Express decided to challenge the compensation bid in court – a case that brought Saeed’s previous claims to light.

At the hearing at Birmingham County Court, the address given for an orthopaedic surgeon who is said to have signed the driver’s medical report was revealed to be that of a taxi company.

Saeed and his friends were found to be lying. Judge Brown said he ‘disbelieved the claimant’s evidence in its entirety’ and ruled that the bus ‘accident’ had never happened.

The unemployed motorist was ordered to pay £15,700 towards the bus firm’s legal costs.

At least two other people were in the process of claiming compensation for injuries they said they had suffered in the same incident. One of them was Saeed’s girlfriend Adele Raven, 27, who has made a total of three accident compensation bids in recent years.

Judge Brown also ordered a transcript 
of the hearing to be sent  to the Director of Public Prosecutions with a
view to a possible prosecution for perjury in relation to this and all 
the previous accident claims.

The judge said the investigation should include Saeed’s witnesses in the car, his solicitors and the medical expert.

He
added that he ‘found it incredible’ that Saeed had filed yet another 
whiplash compensation bid against another party since the bus crash 
claim.

The motorist began 
his compensation requests in September 2003, sometimes claiming for 
three separate whiplash accidents a  year – there were six bids in total
for 2010-11.

It is not 
known whether the DPP or the police have begun a perjury investigation, 
but National Express said it was willing to make a criminal complaint.

Joanne Francis, solicitor for the bus company, promised to defend against ‘dishonest claims’ and ‘prosecute where necessary’.

A National Express spokesman said the firm was ‘delighted’ with the result of the case, adding: ‘We always fight claims in which evidence raises serious concerns.

‘We hope this will make anyone thinking of making a dishonest claim think again.’

The scale of ‘crash for cash’ scams is driving up insurance premiums for innocent motorists.

Experts believe about £60 of a motorist’s annual car insurance premium pays for losses in the industry caused by fake compensation claims.

A gang in County Durham swindled so much money, car insurance firms raised bills in the area by about £100 a year.

The 60 gang members were all either convicted of the estimated £3million fraud or admitted the crime during the past 18 months.

Insurance experts recently told MPs that half of all whiplash claims from car crashes – an estimated £1billion a year – are fraudulent because symptoms are ‘too easy to fake’.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
