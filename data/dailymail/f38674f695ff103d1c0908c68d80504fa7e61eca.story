When most women think of games consoles, thoughts of boyfriends sitting for hours slaying enemies on Call Of Duty or building the dream football team on Football Manager spring to mind.

But one new piece of technology looks set to become a girl's best friend.

Xbox One has launched Xbox Fitness - an interactive fitness app with celebrity personal trainers that's bound to be a hit with gym phobics and couch potatoes.

The future of fitness? Xbox One has unveiled a new app called Xbox Fitness, which allows you to work out with personal trainers such as Tracey Anderson, famed for working with Gwyneth Paltrow and Madonna

You turn on your console and begin by adding your age, height and
 weight. You then choose a workout from one of the trainers, each workout ranges between 10 and 60 
minutes in length.

Trainers include Tracey Anderson, who
 has worked with the likes of Madonna and Gwyneth Paltrow, and Shaun T, 
who created Insanity, a 60-day total-body conditioning workout renowned
 for being insanely challenging yet effective.

Other trainers include Jillian 
Michaels, whose no-nonsense, straight-talking style has whipped dozens of overweight contestants into shape on The Biggest Loser, and Tony Horton, who is the 
master behind some of the bestselling fitness programs in America, 
including P90X, an extreme fitness regime which combines exercise, yoga and martial arts. 

The new system uses Kinect technology, 
which allows it to monitor your movements, map your muscles and measure 
your heart rate without a monitor.

The programme, which prides itself as the 'one place for all your workouts', can read your whole body and then mimic the shape of it on the TV.

It also has personalised commentary, which gives you instant feedback on your performance and tips on how to improve your workout.

There are also personalised and social challenges so you can compete online against your friends.

While the Xbox Fitness app is free, only Xbox Live Gold membership subscribers will be able to access unlimited classes, while an Xbox One console will set you back around Â£500.

Microsoft, the makers of the Xbox, while be hoping that the Fitness app will help fight off strong competition from the Sony Playstation 4, which became the fastest-selling games console in British history at the weekend. It sold 250,000 copies in just 48 hours, beating the Xbox One by 100,000 copies and toppling the previous record, held by the Sony PlayStation portable when it launched in 2005. 

Hundreds of gamers camped for hours, and in some cases days, to be the first to get their hands on the fourth-generation console as shops across the UK opened at midnight on Thursday.
