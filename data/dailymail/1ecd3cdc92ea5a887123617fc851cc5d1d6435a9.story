The family of a mother who police say was brutally murdered in a motel room in front of her three children by her estranged husband are fighting for changes to 911 laws that may have saved her life.

Kari Rene Hunt Dunn had agreed to meet Brad Allen Dunn, whom she planned to divorce, at the Baymont Inn and Suites in Marshall, Texas, with her kids, aged 9, 4 and 3, on December 1, 2013, for a short visitation. But he apparently ambushed her in the motel room and stabbed her to death in the bathroom, police say.

While the alleged attack was happening, Hunt Dunn's nine-year-old daughter tried to call 911 on the motel room phone, following instructions her mother gave her in case of emergencies. However, she wasn't able to call for help because she didn't know she had to press '9' to dial out before calling 911.

'We are attempting to ensure that any person needing police, EMS or the Fire Department at any hotel or motel location may be able to dial the numbers 911 and receive emergency response,' Hunt Dunn's father Hank Hunt wrote on a Change.org petition demanding lawmakers make hotel phones allow 911 calls more easily.

'In a panic, any under age child, or for that matter anyone in an emergency situation should be able to depend on dialing 911 from any phone in the United States and receiving assistance.'

Kari's Law would force all hotel and motel chains, including all 'Mom & Pop' locations to update their phone systems to accept 911 as an emergency call, and use 8 instead as a 'dial out' number.

Divorce: In late November, Dunn, pictured left and right, wrote on his Facebook page that his wife wanted to leave him after a decade together and that he was heartbroken and wanted to fight for his marriage

Signs: 'I asked to go to counseling and (she) said no,' he wrote. 'I am so stressed. They just left with her stuff and kids. This is so hard. Maybe venting on here will help me not freak out in my house'

'We pray the lawmakers in our Congress and Senate hear the cries of Kari and her children,' he wrote. As of Tuesday, the petition had received more than 4,489 signatures.

Dunn is being held on $5 million bond.

Jay Webb, administrative deputy with the Harrison County sheriff's office, confirmed the 31-year-old victim was stabbed.

'I don't know what the situation was. I'm speculating it was from a pending divorce (matter),' he told Marshall News Messenger earlier this month.

Petition: 'We pray the lawmakers in our Congress and Senate hear the cries of Kari and her children,' the woman's father wrote. As of Tuesday, the petition had received more than 4,489 signatures

'I asked to go to counseling and (she) said no,' he wrote. 'I am so stressed. They just left with her stuff and kids. This is so hard. Maybe venting on here will help me not freak out in my house.'

He added that he hated his life at the time.

After the slaying, Dunn fled the scene with his four-year-old daughter prompting an Amber Alert to be issued.

A short time later, Dunn was apprehended near Linden in Cass County by the Cass County Sheriff's office. His daughter was taken into police custody safely then returned to her family.
