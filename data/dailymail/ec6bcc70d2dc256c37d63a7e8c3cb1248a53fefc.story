John Carver has told Newcastle’s hierarchy they will have no chance of finishing in the top half of the Premier League if they sell Moussa Sissoko.

United have insisted it would take an ‘exceptional’ bid for them to consider letting the France midfielder leave the club this month.

But fans fear they are courting such an offer from the likes of Arsenal or PSG, to whom they sold Yohan Cabaye for £20million 12 months ago.

Moussa Sissoko joined Newcastle from Ligue 1 side Toulouse in 2013, but has now hinted he wants to leave

Sissoko has twice given interviews in his homeland in recent weeks in which he speaks of his respect for both of those clubs, and it is thought the player who cost the Magpies just £1.5m from Toulouse two years ago will move on, be it now or in the summer.

It was confirmed earlier this week that Carver will remain in caretaker charge until the end of the season, and he was immediately handed the remit of returning a top-10 finish.

The 50-year-old, however, has made it clear to managing director Lee Charnley that losing star player Sissoko would all but extinguish those hopes.

Newcastle caretaker manager John Carver is to stay in charge of the Magpies until end of season

Newcastle are currently 11th in the table but have lost five of their last seven and are still searching for a first win under Carver, who could land the role on a permanent basis if he impresses and No.1 target Steve McClaren decides to stay with Derby.

But many supporters believe the club have written off the remainder of this campaign and are threatening to cancel their season-ticket direct debit for next year before tomorrow’s deadline.

Carver, though, has rejected the claim that this term is as good as over.

'Everybody on the outside is talking about our season petering away but I am not going to allow that to happen,’ he said.

The French international is reportedly attracting interest from Paris St Germain

'Those who are saying that don't know me, don't know the people around me and don't know this group of players.

'We're much more professional than that. We can't afford to let the season drift away and I won't allow it to happen.

'I'm too demanding and I won't allow anyone to slacken off between now and the end of May.' Newcastle have reacted to supporter concern by announcing yesterday that season-ticket prices will be frozen this summer. But the club also warned that tickets for higher-category games – such as the Tyne-Wear derby and matches against the top four – would be restricted for members only.

Top scorer Papiss Cisse could return for Newcastle at Hull after Senegal went out of the Africa Cup of Nations

Meanwhile, Carver has confirmed that Dave Watson – former Everton defender and FA Cup-winning captain – has been promoted to his backroom staff, but will also continue as Under-18 coach.

Watson will be in the dugout when Newcastle travel to Hull City for Saturday’s lunchtime kick-off.

So, too, could Papiss Cisse. United’s nine-goal top scorer has been eliminated from the Africa Cup of Nations with Senegal and is due back on Tyneside this week.
