Merchiston Castle School teacher James Rainy Brown, 75, hanged himself at home in Colinton, Edinburgh after claims of inappropriate conduct

A veteran teacher at a private school for boys committed suicide as police probed claims of his 'inappropriate conduct' towards pupils.

Bachelor James Rainy Brown, 75, who had worked for 52 years at Merchiston Castle School in Edinburgh, hanged himself at his home shortly after being told of the investigation.

It is understood the claims involved lewd and inappropriate comments to pupils rather than physical abuse.

Mr Brown had been a respected member of staff at the school, which charges fees of up to £26,655 a year.

Shortly after his death two weeks ago, head teacher Andrew Hunter posted an online tribute stating that it was 'too early yet to be definitive about the circumstances of his passing'.

Parents were not briefed about the latest revelations surrounding the teacher's death until last week, after the Scottish Daily Mail contacted the school.

Mr Brown, who had two nieces, killed himself soon after police visited the school and he was confronted about the allegations.

Now his 'heartbroken' family say they hope his name will be cleared.

The 'historic' claims were deemed credible enough by Police Scotland to begin an investigation, which is still technically ongoing despite Mr Brown's death.

A source close to the probe said: 'A detailed letter was sent to the police which made clear allegations about Mr Brown.

'The police went to the school to speak to the headteacher about the claims which involved inappropriate comments that had been made to pupils of a lewd nature - not physical offences.'

It is believed that Mr Brown hanged himself at his home in Colinton, Edinburgh, only an hour after learning about the allegations - although officers have not yet been able to confirm the timescale.

A Police Scotland spokesman said: 'There are no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death and a report will be sent to the procurator fiscal.'

Mr Rainy Brown was a popular figure at Merchiston Castle School in Edinburgh where he taught for 52 years

A spokesman for Mr Brown's family said: 'This is simply a tragedy. It is so unfair that it should happen to a man who dedicated his entire life to teaching and helping generations of children.

'He was the most dedicated, honourable and popular teacher you could imagine. The school was his life and his lifelong commitment to it belonged to another age.

'We are 100 per cent confident that, when the police have finished their work, his name will be cleared - but that won't bring him back and we miss him terribly.'

A spokesman for the school said: 'The events of the past fortnight have been extremely traumatic for everyone associated with Merchiston Castle.

'James was a hugely respected and popular figure here, as shown by the tidal wave of letters, emails and expressions of shock and sympathy from all over the world. His death has come as a tremendous blow to the entire school population.'

In an online tribute, Mr Hunter said the news that 'JRB' - as the teacher was affectionately known - had died was 'a tremendous blow to the entire Merchiston Castle community'.

He added: 'Boys, parents, staff, Merchistonians and former parents have expressed their shock and deep sorrow that this seemingly ever-present figure will no longer be seen on our sports fields or in our classrooms.'

The teacher had been 'an enduring and almost ever-present fixture at Merchiston' since arriving as a pupil in 1951.

After gaining his physics degree from Edinburgh University, Mr Brown rejoined the school as a science and maths teacher in 1960.

Mr Hunter said: 'His wide and varied interests, his unflagging energy and his unmatched commitment to the life of the school over the following 52 years are the stuff of legend.'

Mr Brown was called 'an outstanding teacher and academic, sports coach, outdoors enthusiast, housemaster and tutor and leaves an indelible mark across so many aspects of the history of this place'.

A 'fitting tribute' was planned, Mr Hunter said. He concluded that Mr Brown's 'unstinting' service to Merchiston 'belonged to another age' and it was 'no exaggeration to say that we will not see his like again'.

On a separate Facebook page, someone with the name 'Alice Taxidermist' wrote: 'Why would JRB kill himself? 'Deeply religious, fairly good health, I saw him just past December.

'Huge tragedy in my mind! Why?' The school stated that Mr Brown had requested a private funeral as he had wanted only 'the minimum legal requirements' to be fulfilled.
