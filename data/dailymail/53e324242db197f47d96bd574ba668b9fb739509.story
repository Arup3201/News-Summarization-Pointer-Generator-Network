Wood used as a biofuel could make air pollution worse and cause almost 1,400 deaths a year in Europe, scientists have warned.

Trees grown as a biofuel have been seen as a greener, cleaner alternative to fossil fuels but could be having a detrimental effect on air quality.

According to a new report they release a chemical into the air that, when mixed with other pollutants, can damage human health and reduce crop yields.

The red hotspots show where deaths are expected to rise the most as a result of trees planted as biofuel crops.

‘Growing biofuels is thought to be a good thing because it reduces the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,’ said Nick Hewitt, who worked on the study with colleagues from at Lancaster University.

‘What we're saying is “yes, that's great, but biofuels could also have a detrimental effect on air quality.

‘Large-scale production of biofuels in Europe would have small but significant effects on human mortality and crop yields.

‘As far as we know, no one has looked at the air quality of growing biofuel crops before.’The report, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, looked into the impact of a European Union scheme to slow climate change by producing more biofuels.

A similar impact would be expected wherever biofuels were produced in large quantities in areas suffering air pollution, including the United States and China.

Poplar, willow or eucalyptus trees, all used as fast-growing sources of renewable wood fuel, emit high levels of the chemical isoprene as they grow, the study said.

Isoprene forms toxic ozone when mixed with other air pollutants in sunlight.

The report estimated that ozone from wood-based energy to meet the European Union's 2020 goal would cause nearly 1,400 premature deaths a year, costing society £4.4 billion ($7.1bn).

The European plan would also reduce the annual value of wheat and maize production by £900 million ($1.5bn) since ozone impairs crop growth, the study added.

Changes in monthly mean ozone levels in July caused by trees grown for biofuel. Red shows the highest rises.

Air pollution from extra isoprene is likely to reduce wheat and maize crops. Red indicates the worst hit areas.

Other scientists said the findings showed that the impact of biofuels on human health needs to be taken into consideration when planning crops.

But they said it is one of many factors and that the advantages of replacing fossil fuels with biofuels should not be ignored.

Dr Angela Karp, Scientific Director of the Cropping Carbon Institute Programme, Rothamsted Research, did not see the study’s findings being a reason to reverse the UK’s biofuels policies.

‘It is well known that many trees emit isoprene and efforts have been placed on reducing this,’ she said.

‘We have flagged this up as a target for research, pointing out that reducing isoprene emissions from willow would not only reduce greenhouse gases but reduce loss of carbon from the plant.

‘Having said that, at least one previous publication I know of does not suggest that the levels harm air quality.

‘For all these reasons we do not see that the UK needs to reconsider its interest in biofuels.’

Wheat is one of the crops likely to suffer a fall in yield.

Prof Ottoline Leyser, of the University of Cambridge, added: ‘There are many different biofuel crops, cultivation methods, production and processing systems post-harvest, and different final biofuels. ‘Each one has advantages and disadvantages, which must be compared to the advantages and disadvantages of alternative options.

‘The key is to ensure that the policies driving biofuel development and adoption are properly formulated to take account of these complexities.’

Siting new biofuel plantations far away from polluted population centres would help limit ozone formation, the study suggested. Genetic engineering might be used to reduce isoprene emissions, it said.

Ozone can cause lung problems and is blamed for killing about 22,000 people a year in Europe.

Overall air pollution, mainly from fossil fuels, causes about 500,000 premature deaths in Europe a year, according to the European Environment Agency.

He noted that the main reason to shift to biofuels was to cut emissions of carbon dioxide, mainly from fossil fuels, that U.N. studies project will become ever more damaging this century.

The United Nations' World Health Organization estimates global warming has caused more than 140,000 deaths annually worldwide since the 1970s.

The biggest impact was recorded in developing nations where floods, droughts and other disasters blamed on climate change left millions of people suffering from diarrhoea, malnutrition, malaria and dengue fever.

Burning biofuels is viewed as neutral for climate change because plants soak up carbon when they grow and release it when they burn or rot.

Fossil fuels, by contrast, add carbon to the atmosphere from underground stores millions of years old.
