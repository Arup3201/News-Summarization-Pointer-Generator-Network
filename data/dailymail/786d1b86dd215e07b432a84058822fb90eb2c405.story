Pele, who is in a Sao Paulo hospital for treatment for a urinary tract infection, has been moved to a special care unit hospital wing.

This after the Albert Einstein Hospital issued a short statement saying the soccer great had been moved after suffering 'clinical instability.'

The hospital did not provide any further details but did say that contrary to previous reports, he is not in the Intensive Care Unit.

All time great: Over the course of his career he scored 1281 goals in 1363 games, including 72 goals in 92 World Cup games

Jose Fornos Rodrigues, Pele's personal aide, said Pele was 'completely fine' and the move was primarily to protect his privacy.

'He was uncomfortable with so many people coming. It'll be quieter now,' Rodrigues said by telephone. 

Pele was discharged from the same hospital on Nov. 13 after undergoing surgery to remove kidney stones.

Over the course of his career he scored 1281 goals in 1363 games, including 72 goals in 92 World Cup games.
