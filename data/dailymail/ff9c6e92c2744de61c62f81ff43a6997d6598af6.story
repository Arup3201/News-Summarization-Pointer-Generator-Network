The recordings of frustrated emergency responders have been released showing the havoc that the George Washington Bridge closure wreaked in Fort Lee, New Jersey after Governor Chris Christie’s aides plotted retribution against a political enemy.

Responders who were searching for quick routes to get an ambulance to an elderly woman in distress and police to the hunt for a missing boy frantically tried to find quicker routes to the emergencies but were stuck in unmoving traffic like thousands of residents.  

'Fort Lee traffic is a nightmare,' one dispatcher is heard saying in the call that came as police responded to the report of a missing 4-year-old boy.

About 10 minutes later, someone tried to ascertain the scope of the gridlock as responders tried to get to the scene on September 9.

'It's backed up, probably, all the way into Cliffside,' he said, meaning the neighboring town of Cliffside Park.

That same day, someone in Fort Lee called for an ambulance but a dispatcher had to be creative on the spot in issuing directions to deal with the traffic jam that came as a result of lane closures on the GW Bridge into New York City.

'The George Washington Bridge is totally gridlocked,' a dispatcher said, giving alternate directions to a driver to help circumvent the traffic.

Hours of similar dispatch tapes were released Friday that span the week in September when traffic jams clogged streets and trapped motorists in their cars for hours.

A 91-year-old woman died at her Fort Lee 
home while the gridlock was at its height, but family members have said 
they don't believe the traffic was a factor in her death.

Plot: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's chief of staff Bridget Kelly (seen at right with him on September 12, 2013 as the lane closures were in effect) allegedly planned the 'traffic study' to get back at the mayor of Fort Lee for not endorsing Christie

An Associated Press review of dispatch tapes and call logs and interviews from neighboring towns shows the traffic jams appeared not to lead to anyone's death or seriously compromise their medical care. The missing 4-year-old was also found safe.

The 911 records, obtained over several weeks through public records requests, included reports of chest pains, traffic collisions, false fire alarms and a dead goose in a parking lot.

And dispatchers not only had to deal with the usual phalanx of calls for medical help.

'We're getting calls from irate motorists,' one dispatcher said.

In each call, dispatchers and first responders voiced frustration and exasperation as streets that normally carry heavy amounts of traffic during the morning rush hour turned into virtual parking lots.

'Lemoine is packed. Fletcher's packed,' a responder radioed in about streets near the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee.

Co-conspirator: Other documents released earlier this week show that David Wildstein, Christie's number 2 at the Port Authority who helped approve the closures with Kelly, joked about the traffic and didn't take it seriously

Officials said response times were doubled or quadrupled because of the traffic.

The traffic jams occurred from September 9 to 13, and have led to dozens of people being subpoenaed.

Those summoned include many in Christie's inner circle, his re-election commission and the state Republican party.

At least four people have lost their jobs because of the traffic jams, which were believed to be aimed at Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich after he did not endorse Christie for re-election.

Christie has apologized for the lane closures and said he was 'embarrassed and humiliated' by a former aide who called for the shutdown.

The governor also has said he was not involved and had no knowledge of the lane closures beforehand.

The U.S. Attorney for New Jersey and the state legislature continue to investigate.

Town officials have said the traffic jams caused unnecessary delays for first responders.
