Following a deluge that has blighted the end of August, Britain is expecting a return to summer next week.

As Hurricane Christobal makes its way across the Atlantic, forecasters predict it will create an area of high pressure, leading to glorious sunshine.

But before rushing to grab a pair of sunglasses or planning an impromptu trip to the beach, the UK will have to endure a wet and windy weekend.

The steam fair in Dorset usually attracts around 200,000 visitors, although rain may have put off many form coming to the event this year

The storm is currently moving north east and will change to an ex-hurricane in the coming days as it reaches warmer waters where it formed. 

However it will miss the UK and will therefore not wreak the havoc caused by ex-hurricane Bertha.

The spell of sunshine, which will see temperatures rise above 20C, is expected to last for around a week.

A spokesman for the Met Office said that after seven days of warmer termperatures, northern and western areas may see the return of unsettled weather, before it heads to the south and east a couple of days later.

Next week will be largely warm and sunny thanks to an area of high pressure moving in to southern England, but this week has seen heavy rain

But before the glorious conditions returns, heavy, showery rain is expected across the country from tonight and is forecast to last through the weekend.

Tomorrow, central, southern and south-eastern England will have sunny intervals, but they will be interrupted by downpours.

It is expected to be an unsettled day elsewhere across the UK with showers or longer outbreaks of rain, some of which will be heavy and give the risk of thunder.

Hurricane Cristobal has ravaged parts of the Caribbean, including the Dominican Republic, and has also hit the Bahamas.
