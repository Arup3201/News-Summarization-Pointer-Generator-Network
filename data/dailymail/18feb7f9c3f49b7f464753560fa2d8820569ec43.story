A Sangatte-style refuge camp for Asian and African migrants bound for Britain has been opened up  in the French port of Calais.

The town's mayor Natacha Bouchart said the number of people crossing the Channel had become ‘untenable’ and required radical action.

She had previously called on locals to report squats, parks and campsites being used by illegal immigrants in a bid to shut them down.

Shelter: Migrants sleep in makeshift tents pitched near the Channel ferry terminal in Calais, France. They will now be able to access running water, heating and a sanitary block at a £70,000 winter refuge in the town

Now, she has decided to spend £70,000 on a winter refuge - providing migrants with running water, heating and a sanitary block.

The
camp - situated in the centre of Calais - is similar in concept to the 
infamous Sangatte asylum centre, which attracted thousands of UK-bound 
migrants before it was closed by the 
French authorities in 2002.

It opened its doors early last Thursday to a queue of more than 100 Syrians, Eritreans and Afghans.

The
migrants had been forced to beg for shelter due to stormy winds which 
had blown away their makeshift tents pitched within walking distance of 
the Channel ferry terminal.

Shut down: Sangatte, which attracted thousands of UK-bound migrants, was closed by authorities in 2002

Billed as a ‘humanitarian gesture’, the camp will remain open to migrants from 7pm to 7.30 am when temperatures fall below freezing during the day and minus 5 at night .

However, its opening has sparked anger among a group of residents calling itself ‘Save Calais’.

The
outraged locals plan a sit-in demonstration in front of the Town Hall 
to protest at the port falling prey to ‘massive immigration’. 

Last week, it emerged that Calais's council has been forced to employ a security firm to patrol the seafront to prevent desperate migrants from breaking into beach huts.

The immigrants were also sleeping rough on sand dunes and inhabiting the town's parks.

Speaking today to justify the new winter refuge, Ms Bouchart said there were ‘between 10 and 15’ illegal squats in the town which are now subject to legal moves to evict migrants.

The largest squat - situated at Boulevard Victor Hugo - belongs to an 80 year old woman.

It was occupied by the British anarchist group No Borders and is currently home to up to 90 migrants.

Sub Prefect of Calais Alain Gerard said that all evictions will be handled with ‘the maximum of humanity and respect’.
