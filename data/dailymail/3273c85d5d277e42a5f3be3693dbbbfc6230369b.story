Boom to bust: Gregg Wallace has seen his third company shut down, following two others last year

His cooking advice may be lapped up by millions on Masterchef, but Gregg Wallace may need to listen to some of his own tips as he appears to be on the brink of going bust.

The TV chef’s already crumbling business empire has suffered yet another blow with a third company being shut down following two others in the last year.

The 49-year-old MasterChef judge has been forced to close his Wallace and Co restaurant in Putney, South West London and sell its parent company Wallace Cafes after it failed to attract enough customers and received poor reviews.

The closure comes after the father-of-two closed Gregg’s Bar and Grill in Bermondsey, South London in August and his greengrocers, West Veg Ltd, collapsed in March with debts of more than £500,000.

A source close to the former market trader, who has been married three times, told the Sun on Sunday: ‘Gregg’s not in a happy place - his business empire is collapsing around him.

‘He was forced to sell the restaurant so no one would go bankrupt. But it’s devastating for him after pouring so much cash into it.’

The star has now hired show business agent Jonathan Shalit, who represents Myleene Klass, in a bid to turn his fortune after reportedly sacking his agent of ten years Rosmary Scoular.

‘He has demanded to make millions more from the BBC and other celeb ventures, because he needs the money,’ the source added.

According to Companies House records Wallace, who is dating Anne Marie Sterpini, 21 years his junior, was once the director of nine firms, but six of them have been dissolved with liabilities between £50,000 and £1.8m.

Wallace’s West Veg Ltd is in administration after collapsing with £500,000 worth of debts. Documents showed it owed £78,991 to 15 former employees, £166,915 to partners, £77,839 to NatWest and £143,591 in taxes despite a gross profit of £700,000.

He was forced to close Gregg’s Bar and Grill in London’s Bermondsey Square Hotel when the chain dropped his restaurant after he was involved in a brawl with a fan in another one of its luxury hotels.

The restaurant had a rocky start when it was set up in February 2012, receiving scathing reviews by critics who branded it a ‘travesty’ and a ‘joke’.

Now Wallace Cafes - the company behind his first restaurant Wallace and Co, has been sold with its most recent accounts showing it had a net worth of -£146,639, assets of £65,812 and liabilities of £405,841.

His Lobster Enterprises is now Wallace’s only remaining directorship.

Wallace, who was born in Peckham, began his career selling vegetables at a stand in Covent Garden.

He started George Allan’s Greengrocers in 1989, a company that built up to an eventual turnover of £7.5 million.
