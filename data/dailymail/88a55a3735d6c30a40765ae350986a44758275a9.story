David Cameron blocked a peerage for Ann Widdecombe allegedly because of her opposition to fox hunting, the former Tory MP says.  

In a new book, serialised in The Mail on Sunday, she says that as a former Minister she ‘had a strong probability’ of joining the House of Lords when she left the Commons in 2010.

But she says Mr Cameron, a supporter of hunting, was determined to stop it.

Unburdened: Former Tory MP Ann Widdecombe has revealed the details of her rise to the top of politics in her memoir

Agree to disagree: David Cameron and Ann Widdecombe were on opposite sides of the fox hunting debate. She writes that rumours circled Westminster that the PM had 'set his face against' her getting a peerage

In her blockbuster memoirs, Strictly 
Ann, Ms Widdecombe says she knew she wouldn’t get a peerage ‘because I 
had received private intelligence from an unimpeachable source that 
Cameron had set his face against it’.

Ms
Widdecombe claims that Tory peer Lord Strathclyde ‘said in front of 
others it was because of hunting,’ though she observes: ‘I cannot 
believe Cameron is that petty or so much in the grip of the 
squirearchy.’

Ms Widdecombe
says she opposed ‘big-headed’ Mr Cameron becoming Tory leader because 
of his inexperience, claiming it was ‘madness’ to give him the job.

She says the party became ‘image obsessed’ under his command.

Former
Prisons Minister Ms Widdecombe also uses the book to reopen her feud 
with her former boss, Michael Howard, whom she once famously described 
as having ‘something of the night’ about him.

On the hunt: Ann Widdecombe said she struggled to believe that David Cameron would be as petty as to deny her of a peerage

Ms
Widdecombe gives the first full account of her explosive fallout with 
the former Home Secretary over his sacking of jails boss Derek Lewis 
after a series of prison escapes.

Nearly 20 years after the event, she offers a fresh, devastating critique of Howard’s character.

At various points, she calls him ‘gloating’, ‘vindictive’, ‘gratuitously vengeful’, ‘nasty’, ‘autocratic’ and ‘bullying’.

She says he lacks ‘humanity’ and he was ‘given to kicking men when they were down’.

She
reveals Howard begged former Prime Minister John Major to order her not
to wreck Howard’s Tory leadership bid in 2001 – but Major refused.  

Instead,
Ms Widdecombe writes:  ‘I saw him smile slightly as he said, “I will 
tell Michael you are of fixed purpose,” ’ she writes.

Astonishingly,
Ms Widdecombe says Sir John went further and told her he had rebuked 
Howard over anonymous briefings which tried to smear her by falsely 
claiming she was ‘in love’ with Lewis.

Sir
John said the briefings were ‘a disgrace’– and had told Howard so.

Describing her battle with Mr Howard as ‘mortal combat’, Ms Widdecombe 
says that when her attack killed off his first leadership bid she sent 
a  triumphant message to Mr Lewis: ‘MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.’

Straight shooter: Ann Widdecombe gives the inside story on her dealings with Frances Maude (left) and Michael Portillo (right) who she calls 'arrogant'

In
one of the most sustained political attacks by one senior Tory on 
another, Ms Widdecombe says of Mr Howard, who did become Tory leader in 
2003: ‘He could have been a political giant had he only learned to 
distinguish between toughness and bullying and decisiveness and 
autocracy, if he had known when to stop delivering punishment, if his 
smile did not remind me  of the face of the proverbial tiger, and if he 
had some humanity.

‘I would
trust him with anything except people. I would fight alongside him in 
the jungle...but if the battle went wrong he would look for 
someone to court martial – or just shoot.’

Nor
does Ms Widdecombe pull her punches in describing other Tory foes. She 
suggests ‘arrogant’ Michael Portillo could have been ‘jealous of her’; 
lambasts Portillo’s ‘henchman’ Francis Maude, said Iain Duncan Smith 
‘lacks charisma’ and John Redwood undermined her with ‘silly games’.
