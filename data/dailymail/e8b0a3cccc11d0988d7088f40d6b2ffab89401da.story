A businessman embroiled in a High Court cash fight with his estranged wife 'transferred assets and shares after his marriage got into difficulties', a judge was told today.

Lawyers for Michelle Young suggested to Mr Justice Moor that assets belonging to her husband Scot Young had been transferred to a 'lieutenant' via other people.

They indicated that transfers had come to light after a financial investigator examined Mr Young’s finances.

Battle: Michelle Young, 49, told a High Court judge that her estranged businessman husband Scot once spent £1 million a year on dining out as she launched a High Court divorce settlement battle

Mrs Young, 49, estimates that Mr Young, 51, is worth 'a few billion at least' and says 'there was a vast fortune hidden'.

Mr
Young has yet to give evidence. But he disputes Mrs Young’s claims and 
has said he is 'penniless and bankrupt', a victim of 'financial 
meltdown' and 'hopelessly insolvent'.

Financial
investigator Burke Files today gave evidence about Mr Young’s finances 
and was questioned by Rex Howling QC, for Mrs Young.

Mr
Howling said there appeared to be occasions where assets or shares had 
been transferred by Mr Young then later appeared in the name of his 'lieutenant'. Mr Files agreed.

'The
various schedules suggest that Mr Young could have been telling his 
advisors that he was worth as much as £500 million in 2005/06,' Mr 
Howling has told the judge.

'Mr Young has resolutely failed to provide evidence of where his money has gone.'

He added: 'Mrs Young asserts that Mr 
Young has transferred his beneficial interest in the majority of his 
assets to a number of closely-allied third parties.'

High seas: Mrs Young said her husband Young paid '£2 million to £4 million' for a boat - 'a flash gin-palace, Sunseeker-type boat' - and had talked about buying a 'very expensive helicopter' to fly between a home near Oxford and London

Michelle Young has said she would ‘settle for £300million’ of her husband’s money, plus legal bills.

Michelle
Young and Scot Young – once a successful property tycoon – embarked on 
the final chapter of a seven-year court divorce battle this week.

Mr
Young insists he has no wealth or 
assets to fund the vast divorce settlement his wife demands.

Earlier
this year he served three months of a six-month prison term for 
contempt of court after he failed to reveal information about his 
finances.

Mrs Young, mother to his two children, continues to insist 
he is hiding the truth, and told the High Court he had ‘a vast
fortune hidden’.

She has refused to complete their divorce until the
settlement is agreed, stopping him marrying his fiancée Noelle Reno, a 
29-year-old model.

Plans: Once divorced Mr Young plans to wed his fiancee, 29-year-old model and actress, Noelle Reno

Mrs Young told Mr Justice Moor of the extravagant life she had enjoyed with her husband before they separated in 2006.

‘We
had vast estates. We had staff,’ she said. ‘We had a very luxury 
lifestyle.’ Mrs Young, a former model, said she had jewellery which 
cost a million pounds and which she auctioned at Sotheby’s for between 
£160,000 and £180,000.

She added: ‘We had a chandelier in our drawing room. The other chandelier sits in the White House. They were valuable assets.

‘I
paid £10,000 for a beautiful piece of furniture around 15 or 18 years 
ago. It was a beautiful side piece. I bought that at Sotheby’s.’

Mrs
Young said they had moved house a number of times and the profit on one
house was ‘£10million’. She said Mr Young paid ‘£2million to £4million’
for a yacht – ‘a flash gin-palace, Sunseeker-type boat’ – and had 
talked about buying a ‘very expensive helicopter’ to fly between their 
homes in Oxfordshire and London.

The couple lived in Belgravia, 
central London, for three or four years and in Miami where they owned 
three Porsche cars, she said.

Mrs Young told the judge: ‘My husband 
has never produced a shred of real evidence about where one asset has 
gone to.’ She accused him of being ‘incredibly’ secretive about finance 
and accused him of hiding his ‘vast fortune’ offshore.

‘He was 
constantly on the phone to his high-profile friends and advisers talking
about  multi-million-pound deals he was involved with,’ she said.

‘If
I heard it... he would quickly run off... or jump out of the Phantom or
Ferrari so I couldn’t hear.’ She added: ‘He was  secretive. I wasn’t 
made aware very much regarding the business side.’

Mrs Young, who in
the past has described herself as a  ‘pioneer’ for divorcing women, 
said she wanted a £25million house and wanted to live in Belgravia. She 
was previously awarded £30,000 a month to pay for rent and school fees 
for their two daughters, Scarlett, 20 and Sasha, 18.

In court hearings earlier this year she claimed she was owed more than £1million in unpaid maintenance.

Mr Young denied his ex-wife’s allegations yesterday and at one point asked the judge if her ‘ranting’ was allowed.

He
was made bankrupt over a £1.8million debt in 2010 and claims to be 
living off the generosity of friends including entrepreneur Sir Philip 
Green and the late Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky.

The estranged 
couple began their relationship in 1989 and married in 1995, before 
separating in 2006. After a hearing due to last four weeks Mr Justice 
Moor will make a final decision about how much Mr Young is worth.

The trial is being staged in private but Mr Justice Moor has given permission for it to be reported.

The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
