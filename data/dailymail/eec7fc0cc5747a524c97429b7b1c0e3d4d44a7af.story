Former NFL player Chad Johnson was about to get off on a probation violation with a slap on the wrist—but then he slapped his lawyer's butt.

Johnson, nicknamed 'Ochocinco' for his old football jersey number, was sentenced 30 days in jail for a domestic violence probation violation by a judge because he slapped his male lawyer's butt in court Monday, according to the Associated Press.

Florida's Broward County Circuit Judge Kathleen McHugh was about to sign-off on  a plea agreement the former wide-receiver had reached with prosecutors calling for community service and counseling instead of jail, but McHugh said she didn't think he was taking the proceedings seriously.

McHugh asked Johnson, 35, if he was satisfied with his attorney Adam Swickle and in response Johnson reportedly smacked Swickle's backside, causing the court to erupt in laughter.

But McHugh wasn't amused.

'I don't know that you're taking this whole thing seriously. I just saw you slap your attorney on the backside. Is there something funny about this?' McHugh said. 'The whole courtroom was laughing. I'm not going to accept these plea negotiations. This isn't a joke.'

Johnson tried to apologize.

'This is your courtroom. I have no intent to make this a joke. It's not funny,' he said. 'My life is in a shambles right now and I try my best to laugh and keep a smile on my face.'

As Chad Johnson discovered Monday, slapping, spanking or otherwise hitting someone's behind is not appropriate courtroom behavior - however commonplace it is on football fields and in locker rooms of most American sports.

No one really knows when the practice began, but congratulatory butt slapping between male athletes - as well as female athletes - has long been used to say 'job well done'.

Kind of like a fist-bump or more old fashioned high five, the butt slap shouldn't be considered sexual.

Johnson turned himself in on May 20 
for failing to meet with his probation officer and attending an 
intervention program. In September, the ex-Miami Dolphin pleaded no 
contest to a misdemeanor domestic battery charge a month after being 
arrested for headbutting his new wife, reality star Evelyn Lozada, 
during an argument.

McHugh wouldn't head his apology.

'It's not the first time he's behaved that way in my courtroom,' she said.

Swickle, the subject of the offensive slap, tried to reason with the judge as well.

'He has suffered. He has lost everything,' Swickle said.

Johnson was handcuffed in court and taken to jail. His probation, which would have been over in September, was extended through the end of the year, according to TMZ. In addition to jail time , Johnson also has to serve 25 more hours of community service and complete more therapy.

While his future now seems a little uncertain, in court Johnson expressed hopes that he might sign with another football team this year.

When Johnson was arrested in August, the Miami Dolphins released him and he hasn't played in the NFL since.
