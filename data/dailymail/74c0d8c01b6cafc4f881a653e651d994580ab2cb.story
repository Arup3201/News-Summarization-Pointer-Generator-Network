Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has revealed he never feared Liverpool would beat his side to the Barclays Premier League title last season.

Ahead of Monday night’s clash at The Etihad the Chilean hinted Brendan Rodgers’ team struggled to handle the pressure as the finishing line moved into sight in May.

Big game: Manuel Pellegrini appreciates the importance of the clash with Liverpool

Liverpool pulled clear at the top of the table in April after defeating City 3-2 at Anfield but, rather than glory, their season ended in tears and trauma.

A costly slip from captain Steven Gerrard contributed to a home defeat by Chelsea and one week later they threw away a three-goal advantage at Selhurst Park to draw 3-3 with Crystal Palace.

City, by contrast, won their final five matches to overcome their Merseyside rivals and lift the Premier League trophy.

‘I was not surprised,’ Pellegrini admitted. ‘I was absolutely convinced when I said the words that I said, “careful it’s not finished because they have to play four games more and the pressure when you are at the top of the table is increasing after every game”.

Raring to go: Frank Lampard has been declared fit to play his part against Liverpool 

‘The most important thing for us was not to think about Liverpool but think about what we had to do. From my experience, when you are finishing the season the pressure increases every week for every team, not only for Liverpool.

‘That’s why I was absolutely sure they weren’t going to win the five games they had to play.’

Pellegrini, who described Monday’s clash as a ‘game of six points’, believes Liverpool will be a rather different proposition without Luis Suarez.

He said: ‘It is so difficult to answer after just one game but maybe they will always miss Luis Suarez. He is a very important player but they have brought a lot of important new players and they continue to have a very strong squad.’

Pellegrini is considering handing Sergio Aguero a first start of the season after his goalscoring impact from the bench in the 2-0 win at Newcastle last weekend.

Bosnian forward Edin Dzeko is expected to lead the line against Liverpool days after penning a new deal but £32million signing Eliaquim Mangala is not ready to feature after joining the club from Porto last week.
