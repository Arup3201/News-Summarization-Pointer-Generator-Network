Wayne Rooney deserves his place in the 'pantheon of English football's finest', according to former Three Lions striker Gary Lineker.

After three World Cups, two European Championships and 43 goals, the 29-year-old is on Saturday set to bring up a century of caps when Slovenia arrive for a Euro 2016 qualifier.

It is a feat just eight players have previously achieved in an England shirt and one which Rooney plans to celebrate by walking out at Wembley with his children, Kai and Klay.

The Three Lions skipper's 100th cap will see him bracketed alongside the likes of Bobby Moore, David Beckham and Sir Bobby Charlton - illustrious company which Lineker, who scored 48 goals in 80 appearances for his country, believes the forward deserves to be recognised alongside.

'He has to rank right up there in the pantheon of English football's finest,' Lineker told BBC Radio 5 live.

'He has scored 40-odd goals for his country and has been a consistent performer.

'It has not quite happened for him in major tournaments for various reasons, barring the first one, where he exploded on to the scene in 2004 and played so well,' he added.

'He has very rarely gone to a major tournament in prime condition. On other occasions the team has not performed that well.

'There is no doubt he is a great player. He is brilliant at finding space and dropping deep. He is a good all-round footballer and scores plenty of goals.

'He has been a massive scorer for England, particularly in qualifying games.'
