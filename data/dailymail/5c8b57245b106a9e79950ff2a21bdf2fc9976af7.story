We all get a bit grumpy on an empty stomach - but there's no need to get angry and violent about it.

But try telling that to these two herons, who were literally at each other's throats after fighting over a fish.

The pair were fishing for their supper in the Camargue area of southern France and it seems that one may have snatched the tasty catch right out of the other's mouth.

And as these pictures, by Italian photographer Pino Magliani show, his friend didn't take to kindly to it.

That was mine! This hungry heron gets ready to give its friend a few choice words and well-aimed pecks after missing out on a tasty fish supper

Magliani, 45, was delighted to capture the hilarious exchange.

He said: 'I spent a couple of hours photographing the herons, and these two had been standing together looking for fish for a long time.

'They were obviously getting very hungry, and probably a bit grumpy. Suddenly, another heron in the group caught a fish, and there was a squabble for it.

'One of the herons didn't end up getting any of the fish, and was obviously a bit put out.

'The flock got really angry and quite aggressive, and they stood in silence for a while.

'Then, one of them suddenly approached the other, and went right up into his face.

'It made me chuckle because he looked so angry - and his friend was taken completely by surprise.

Back off! The heron looks quite horrified that his friend should take losing a fish so personally

And another thing! The pictures were taken by photographer Pino Magliani in the Camargue area of southern France

Calm down! The attacker finally backs off, as the other heron looks on haughtily

'I love photographing the birds, but they are very shy creatures.

'I have to use a hide when I'm taking pictures. I use a very light hide that is similar to a poncho - it covers just me and the tripod with the camera. It is very portable and light.

'There are so many birds and they're all different. There is a different way to photograph each species and this is very stimulating because you have to take a different approach every time.'
