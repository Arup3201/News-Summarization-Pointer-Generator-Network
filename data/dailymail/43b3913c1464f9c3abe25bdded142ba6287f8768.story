Brave: Stephanie Brown suffers from a rare skin condition which means any form of anxiety can lead to her breaking out in large spots

For most schoolchildren, slipping up in the playground can cause the odd graze and a bit of embarrassment.

But for Stephanie Brown, any form of anxiety could trigger a head-to-toe rash - and leave her entire body covered in scabs.

The six-year-old suffers from an extremely rare skin condition called Diffuse Cutaneous Mastocytosis (DCM).

Any form of emotional or environmental stress triggers a flare up, causing thickening of the skin and blistering.

In the past, the only part of her body that hasn't been affected is the tip of her nose.

Stephanie's condition is so extreme that people often stop and stare at her in the street during a flare-up.

Her mother Maria, 42, said: 'If she's anxious or gets upset, or even if it's just too cold, she comes out in big red blotches.

'Within seconds, her whole body is covered in big pinky brown coloured spots, and they won't go away until she calms down.

'It's events that trigger it, so if she falls over in the supermarket or if someone says something she's not sure about.

'Only the other day, one of her friends asked her to come and play. But because she didn't know what to say, it sparked a break out.'

'Depending on the flare up, I will give her antihistamines, but generally a cuddle with her mum will help her to calm down.'

Stephanie's condition is caused by her body producing too many 'mast cells'. These are blood cells formed in the bone marrow to help fight off infection and illness.

Mrs Brown, a learning mentor, and her husband Nigel, 40, a lorry driver, first noticed something was wrong when Stephanie was born.

Battle: Stephanie as a baby. Her condition, called Diffuse Cutaneous Mastocytosis (DCM),  means any form of emotional or environmental stress trigger a flare up

Anxiety: 'Within seconds, her whole body is covered in big pinky brown coloured spots, and they won't go away until she calms down,' says Stephanie's mother, Maria

'We spotted a hive on the middle finger 
of her right hand,' said Mrs Brown. 'We asked the midwife about it but 
she said it was nothing - it was quite common and her skin just had to 
get used to the environment.'

Over the next few months the couple were given yet more reasons, such as a clothing or dog allergy.

In the end, Mrs Brown was so desperate for a diagnosis she took Stephanie to Dewsbury and District Hospital, near the family home in Mirfield, West Yorkshire and pleaded with doctors to help.

'By sheer luck there was a dermatologist there and he recognised it as a form of mastocytosis,' she said.

Diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis is an extremely rare condition.

It is caused by the accumulation of mast cells in the skin.

These cells contain substances, such as histamine, that regulate allergic reactions.

The condition is usually found in children and typically resolves itself by puberty.

It causes thickening of the skin and agonising blisters.

There is no cure but treatment helps most patients.

Typical treatments include taking antihistamines to prevent the effect of mast cell histamine.

Stephanie's official diagnosis of DCM came the following month after she was referred to a clinic in Newcastle, Tyne and Wear.

Despite their daughter being only one of three children in the country with the condition at the time, Stephanie's parents say they were relieved to finally have a diagnosis for her.

Mrs Brown said: 'When it all started and no one could tell me what the real problem was, I did a lot of my own research on the internet.

'After about two weeks I was pretty certain it was DCM. It affects 1 in 500,000 people in the UK but Stephanie suffers with a rare strain of it - which meant it was harder to diagnose.'

Stephanie, whose two-year-old sister Gracie does not have the condition, is said to be the first infant in the UK to undergo a pioneering course of 'sun bed' treatment to blitz the disease, where she was showered in bursts of ultra-violet light.

While the treatment has dramatically improved her skin condition, she still has behavioural swings and phobias as a result of the condition, her mother says.

'Some days it will cause her to just run away and hide - but other days she copes well with it. 

'She even shames people in the street who gawp at her by shouting "What's that lady looking at, mummy?"'

'I tell her, "she's looking at you because you're so beautiful."'

The six-year-old was told by a doctor that the rash would have a drawback, however. 

Discussing her future, Mrs Brown claims the doctor told her daughter: 'It won't stop her doing anything she wants to do - unless she wants to be a model.'

Recovery: Since having treatment with UV light, Stephanie (left with Maria, her mother and Gracie, her sister) has shown an improvement. Many children grow out of the condition by the time they are teenagers

But the comment upset Stephanie and her family, who have always encouraged her that her condition is nothing to be ashamed of.

Mrs Brown said: 'As a first time mum to a little girl, I was devastated to hear these words.

'I would love her to get a shot at modelling. Not a career, just a one-off thing, so that we could say "well actually she is".'

There is an 80 per cent chance that Stephanie will grow out of the condition by her teenage years, but either way, her mother hopes the condition won't hold her back from anything.

She added: 'It's not just a condition, it's a place - and in the early days it was a really dark place.

'We've come so far, and we want people to know about the condition, so that those who suffer from it are treated no differently to anyone else. 

'The condition itself has been easier than the prejudice we have had to face.'
