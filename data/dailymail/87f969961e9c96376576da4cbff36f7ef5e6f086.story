He was long-blamed for the failure of Captain Scott's ill-fated expedition to the South Pole in 1911.

However, a historian now believes Edgar Evans - whose injuries were thought to have contributed to the Antarctic mission's demise - was actually an unsung hero.

Legendary Captain Robert Scott led his four-strong team to the South Pole as part of the Terra Nova Expedition.

The group died on the return leg of their journey having lost the Polar race to the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen.

Until now, Welshman Petty Officer Evans was believed to be largely responsible for the failure of the mission due to a head injury he suffered when he fell and hit his on a crevasse, during the expedition.

It was said his deteriorating condition delayed the explorers, diminishing their food supply and leading to their desperate demise.

But now new light has been shed on his role.

Historian Isobel P. Williams claims that Edgar Evans was actually a key player in the expedition and his injury played no part in the men's deaths.

According to Williams they died as a result of the extreme cold and exhaustion, coupled with a 'completely inadequate' diet.

Williams, a former medical consultant in Respiratory Medicine, said her research proved beyond doubt that Evans was an unsung hero.

The historian, who has now published a book about her findings, said: 'Edgar was the first to die and when the news reached England, he was unfairly blamed by some, for the tragedy.

'We now have a better understanding of the appalling physical conditions endured by all members of the Polar assault.

'And my medical knowledge has given me insight into the problems suffered by the explorers on their return and particularly the difficulties that Edgar encountered.

'Edgar died due to circumstances entirely beyond his control and that his determination, endurance and loyalty to Scott makes him a hero of the British Expeditions.'

The Terra Nova Expedition began on 
November 26, 1910 when Captain Scott and his crew left Lyttelton, New 
Zealand, in the hope of becoming the first people to reach the South 
Pole.

Despite atrocious weather conditions, Scott and four companions reached the pole in January 1912.

However
their hopes of snatching the international ‘Polar race’ were dashed 
after they discovered that a team led by their Norwegian rival, 
Amundsen, had beaten them to it.

All
five of Scott’s men died of exposure on the return journey from the 
Pole, with the last three survivors being just 11 miles from the next 
depot of food and fuel.

Scott
held Edgar Evans in high regard, writing in his journal that he was 'a 
giant worker - he is responsible for every sledge, every sledge-fitting,
tents, sleeping-bags, harness, and when one cannot recall a single 
expression of dissatisfaction with any one of these items, it shows what
an invaluable assistant he has been'.

In spite of this, for almost a century, his name has been linked with the party’s failure. Evans was believed to have suffered a serious head injury following a fall into a crevasse on the Beardmore Glacier.

His worsening physical condition delayed the party and what little food they had gradually diminished.

Edgar Evans, a father of three, deteriorated rapidly on the return journey, with little his companions could do to help him. He finally collapsed and died on February 17, 1912.

But in Captain Scott’s Invaluable Assistant, Edgar Evans, Williams reveals that Petty Officer Evans was, in fact, an 'invaluable team member' who was 'far' from incompetent.

The book, Captain Scott's Invaluable Assistant, Edgar Evans is on general sale now, priced £12.99.
