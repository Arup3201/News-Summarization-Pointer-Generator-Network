Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has slammed FIFA for their 'bad organisation' which has led to inconsistent fixture scheduling and poor pitches at the 2014 World Cup.

The Portuguese does not believe that teams from the same group should play their final matches having had an extra day's rest, as is the case in Group G.

Germany and Ghana played their second group match 24 hours earlier than USA and Portugal but both of the final games in Group G are scheduled for Thursday.

Blast: Jose Mourinho has slammed FIFA for their 'bad organisation' during the World Cup in Brazil

Scheduling: Mourinho does not think it is right that Portugal and USA played 24 hours after Germany and Ghana

Rest: Germany played 24 hours before the USA but will face them in their final Group G match on Thursday

And Mourinho thinks that the scheduling problems are down to 'bad orgainsation' from FIFA, and not football's world governing body favouring one side or another.

Speaking as Yahoo's Global Football Ambassador, Mourinho said: 'That situation of 24 hours more from one team to another
team that have to play the third match now, like is the case of our group with
Portugal and the US, is FIFA trying to protect Germany and Ghana, and not
Portugal and US?

'I don't think so. I think it's just bad organisation. So, I
prefer to go in that direction.'

Mourinho also insists that his experience as a spectator trying to watch the World Cup has been limited by the poor pitches in Brazil.

He believes the surfaces used during the World Cup are not 'acceptable' for a tournament of that magnitude.

The 51-year-old said: 'When I look to the matches, there is one that is
clear in my eyes, which is the bad quality of the pitch.

Angry: Mourinho is not happy that his World Cup experience has been disrupted by poor pitches

State: The condition of the surfaces in Brazil have not been 'acceptable' according to Mourinho

Beautiful: Mourinho believes top class football has been harmed by the state of the pitches in Brazil

'Almost every pitch has
not the best qualities to play high quality football.

'And for me, in this
moment, I am not a coach involved in the tournament.

'I'm just somebody that is
in front of the screen trying to enjoy the best football, is something that I
don't think is acceptable at that level.

'The pitches are not the best.'
