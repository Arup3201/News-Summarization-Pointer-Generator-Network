London has been captured as 'a city that never sleeps' by a photographer who shot thousands of images from dusk till dawn for eight days.

Paul Richardson took 20,000 shots and patched them together to make an intricate timelapse video that shows the capital teeming with life.

The dedicated 25-year-old was out on the streets from 10am to 5am capturing shots - from Oxford Circus to Covent Garden to Big Ben.

Nocturnal life: Boats sail up and down the River Thames all through the night. Photographer Paul Richardson, 25, spent up to 19 hours each day on the streets of London to capture life in the city

Referring to Frank Sinatra's song 'Theme from New York, New York,' he said: 'I love the city as it never sleeps, there's always something going on which is interesting to shoot.'

Even when the light dims and the last of the rush hour commuters make their way home, London continues to buzz with activity.

Boats chug up and down the River Thames in front of St Paul's Cathedral even as day turns to night.

Buzzing: Piccadilly Circus is full of Londoners going about their daily lives. In the midst of all the chaos Paul sits patiently photographing the world go by

Calm: Sunrise at Primrose Hill gave Paul a break from the hustle and bustle of London life

He said: 'In London everyone's always got something to do, somewhere to be. Everyone is always busy, busy, busy. I wanted to capture that in this video.'

Paul, from Manchester, spent up to five hours in one position watching life go by and snapping away.

He said: 'In the midst of all that chaos I was able to relax. Especially at Primrose Hill where I watched the sun rise. For a change, everything was quiet.

'It was just me, my lens, and a few other photographers capturing the sun rise.

'As the sun came up, more and more people appeared. First the joggers, then people on their way to work, then the tourists. Another day in London had just begun.'
