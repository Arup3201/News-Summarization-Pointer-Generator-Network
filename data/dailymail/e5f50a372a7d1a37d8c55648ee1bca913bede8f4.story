American expats are giving up their passports as new government rules target tax evaders 

The number of Americans renouncing their U.S. citizenship remains near a record high, ahead of new rules being introduced to clamp down on tax evaders.

In the first half of the year, 1,577 Americans gave up their nationalities at U.S. embassies across the world, according to Federal Register data. This was only the second time the figures have been more than 1,500 since records began in 1998.

Harsher asset-disclosure rules came into effect on July 1, under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (Fatca), meaning that foreign banks such as those in Switzerland are turning over data on their American clients to the U.S. government.

More than 100 Swiss banks are handing over information to avoid prosecution for helping tax evaders, leading 576 American expatriates to renounce their citizenship in the second quarter.

Matthew Ledvina, a U.S. tax lawyer at Anaford AG in Zurich, told Bloomberg: 'Fatca and the Swiss bank disclosure program has intensified the search for U.S. nationals beyond all measure.

'It's shocking the levels of due diligence they are going through to ensure they have cleaned house.'

The USA is the only Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development nation that taxes citizens wherever they live.

This means that to expats who want to avoid paying higher, U.S. level taxes, the idea of giving up their passports is becoming more attractive.

Almost 9,000 Americans have given up their nationalities in the past five years. This year's figures are down 13 per cent on the same time last year, but still remain far higher than ever before.

Up until 2010, the number rarely exceeded 200 per quarter. For the first quarter of 2014, it was 1,001.

Swiss bank UBS AG was fined $780m and forced to hand over data on 4,700 accounts in 2009, triggering the U.S. government's clamp down on expatriates evading tax

According to a survey held last November by the deVere Group in Zurich, the number of Americans renouncing their citizenship could continue to stay high. 

Of 400 expatriates questioned, more than two thirds said they had considered it. It is estimated that around six million Americans are currently living abroad.

The government's step up in their search for tax evaders was triggered in 2009, when UBS AG (UBSN) paid a $780m fine for aiding them, and was forced to give up information on around 4,700 accounts. 

Swiss banks are now going back through their records as far as the 1990s to find any traces of American clients, including people with U.S. addresses or phone numbers, or even those who were schooled there.

All the people they find are either being asked to leave the bank, or being placed into separate, U.S.-only sections, where they will pay American tax rates. 

Fatca was enacted in 2010 by Congress to target  U.S. taxpayers who were using foreign bank accounts and were not complying with U.S. tax laws. 

It came into effect on July 1, after being delayed for 18 months in order to give foreign banks time to comply with it.

It requires banks to report information to the IRS  about  accounts held by U.S. taxpayers, or by foreign entities in which U.S. taxpayers hold a substantial ownership interest.

It also requires U.S. financial institutions to impose a 30 per cent withholding tax on all payments made to foreign banks that do not agree to work with the government by sending them information on account holders. 

It allows the U.S. government to obtain data from more than 77,000 institutions and 80 governments about its citizens’  financial activities abroad.
