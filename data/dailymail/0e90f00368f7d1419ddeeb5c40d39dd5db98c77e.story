Determined: Cheryl Maddison has spoken of how she rebuilt her life after she was stabbed and raped in her Majorca flat

A model has spoken of how she rebuilt her life after she was stabbed and raped in her Majorca flat.

Cheryl Maddison, 25, was knifed repeatedly in the neck, throat and back after being attacked as she returned home from work in a bar in Magaluf.

Moroccan waiter Mohamed Fadel el Anssari, 31, is alleged to have carried out the brutal sex attack with a seven-inch kitchen knife before leaving her for dead in May 2008.

Miss Maddison had only been on the Spanish holiday island for six days when the horrific attack occurred, leaving her to battle physical and mental scars.

The ordeal left her too scared to go to bed or even be in the bath on her own.

'I couldn’t get the image of his hands out of my head. I used to think about his hands coming towards me and around my neck. It was horrible,' she told The Sun.

'I even took all the door handles off in my house so nobody else could open the doors. Eventually I told myself, "I can’t carry on like this".'

She decided to face her fear and spent two summers  working in Zante, Greece as a Club 18-30 rep in 2011.

She explained: 'I was determined not to let the attack stop me enjoying my life and travelling.

Mohamed Fadel el Anssari, 31, is accused of preying on vulnerable British tourists in the party resort of Magaluf. One of them was model Cheryl Maddison

'I
did my best to get back to my normal self and worked away and got my 
life back to normal and I am a stronger person than I was before,' she told ITV's Daybreak.

In the interview she called her boyfriend of one year, Kaine MacDonald, 21, her 'rock' as he attended the trial with her every day.

Last week prosecutor Jaime Guasp said Fadel was 'evil serial rapist' who should be jailed for 23 years after

Mr Guasp said he preyed on vulnerable British tourists in the party resort of Magaluf.

Fadel,
who has Spanish residency, should spend more than two decades behind 
bars and should then be deported to his native Morocco, the prosecutor 
said.

Support: She called her boyfriend of one year, Kaine MacDonald, 21, her 'rock' as he attended the trial with her every day

In his closing arguments following Fadel's three-day trial for rape and attempted murder, Mr Guasp said police believed Fadel was responsible for a number of violent sex attacks.

He said: 'The majority of foreigners who come here are hard-working, decent people. But there are some who come here who are bad people. This was a terrible, wicked act.

'Spain gave Fadel the chance to work and reside here and this is how he pays Spain back. We are dealing with an evil person, a serial rapist.'

Calling for Fadel to be jailed for 23
years - 12 for attempted murder and 11 for rape - Mr Guasp added: 'If 
we want to stop this sort of crime we need severe, harsh sentences.

'He
should spend all of those years in prison and should then be sent back 
to Morocco, and he should never be allowed back here.'

The
prosecutor said Miss Maddison had gone to Majorca to work and was not one of 
the 'British hooligans' who behave appallingly in the resort of Magaluf.

Brave: Miss Maddison came face-to-face with her 
attacker Mohamed Fadel El Anssari as he admitted the crime in court in 
the Majorcan capital Palma

Petite Miss Maddison was attacked at around 4am on May 30, 2008 as she returned home to her rented flat after working a shift in a bar.

She
was raped, stabbed repeatedly in the neck, throat and back and left for
dead. She spent two weeks in hospital and doctors said she was lucky to
survive.

Fadel was arrested in July 2011 following a lengthy undercover police investigation.

Detectives recovered a cigarette he discarded in the street and found his DNA matched that found at the scene of the crime.

The court heard he has twice confessed to raping and stabbing Miss Maddison and to a second rape on a British tourist in Magaluf in 2010.

He was once arrested for a sexual assault on a minor and regularly beat his wife, the court heard.

In 2011 Fadel told police and an investigating magistrate he had attacked Miss Maddison because she refused to have sex with him when he approached her in the stairwell of her apartment block, the court heard.

Injuries: Cheryl Maddison, 25, was left for dead by her attacker in Magaluf. Neighbour Laura Pamela said she heard the cries but assumed they were from an arguing couple

Bandaged wound: Cheryl Maddison, pictured aged 21 in 2008, said she only realised he had stabbed her in the chest when she came round and stood up to find she had been lying in a large pool of blood

Fadel told police he had taken at 
least two grammes of cocaine on the night of the attack, and forced his 
way into Miss Maddison's apartment when she refused to let him in.

He
told officers: 'I didn't want to hurt her, only to have sex. I lost 
control. I took a knife from the kitchen. I didn't know what I was 
doing.

'I thought either I kill her or I leave. I saw so much blood. I don't remember what happened next.'

In
his closing speech, defence lawyer Carlos Portalo called for Fadel to 
be acquitted, claiming his privacy had been breached by police when they
tested his cigarette butt for DNA.

Mr
Portalo also said police had failed to follow procedure by carrying out
the DNA tests without the prior authorisation of a judge.

The
prosecutor dismissed those arguments as 'totally absurd'. The panel of 
three judges will give their verdict in a written ruling.

Holiday isle: Magaluf is the number one destination for British package tour holidaymakers

They gave handcuffed Fadel the chance to say something at the end of the trial, but he only said: 'I have nothing to say.'

Outside court Miss Maddison,  from Houghton Le Spring, County Durham, explained why she had waived her right to anonymity.

She told ITV's Daybreak: 'There were so many stories going about that were not true, so I wanted to get the story put straight.

Miss Maddison said she had travelled to Majorca to give evidence to try to bring some closure to her ordeal.

She said: 'I'm glad that I came. I have been with my partner for a year and I have totally moved on and have my life back.'
