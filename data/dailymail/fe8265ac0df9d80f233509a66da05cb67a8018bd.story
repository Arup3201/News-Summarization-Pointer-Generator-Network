It has been the stage on which political rivals have fought for hundreds of years.

But drama of a different  kind could soon be coming to Westminster – after MPs agreed plans to hire out the Houses of Parliament to  Hollywood film studios.

The move, which would allow action blockbusters and period dramas to be filmed inside for the first time, is designed to help pay for repairs to the increasingly rundown 19th Century Palace of Westminster.

Any refurbishment, which will include
 removing asbestos, fixing leaky roofs and replacing the 1930s 
electrical and heating systems, could cost more than £1 billion.

MPs reckon that film studios would pay at least £10,000 a day to hire the buildings.

One said last night: ‘We’d be mad not to hire the place out to the highest bidder.

‘Other imposing 19th Century 
buildings make a fortune  providing interiors of what is supposed to be 
inside the  Commons. Let’s give them the real thing and save the 
taxpayer some cash into the bargain.’

Although TV cameras have been 
recording Commons proceedings for more than a decade, any filming 
connected to ‘advertising, fundraising or for commercial purposes’ is 
banned.

A fake House of Commons was built for the filming of Jeffrey Archer's First Among Equals in 1986, it was then used for The Iron Lady

The Iron Lady was filmed in a 5,000 sq ft replica of The House of Commons instead of the real thing

The Treasury's circular court was used as a nightclub in the latest installment of The Fast and the Furious

Even dramas supposedly  set in 
Westminster are filmed elsewhere, with Manchester Town Hall doubling as 
Parliament’s neo-gothic corridors and meeting rooms.

In the 2011 film The Iron Lady, which
 saw Meryl Streep win an Oscar for her portrayal  of Margaret Thatcher, 
the  Commons chamber was actually a 5,000 sq ft replica.

Earlier this year, the imitation 
chamber – first used in Granada TV’s 1986 adaptation of Jeffrey Archer’s
 First Among Equals – was sold on eBay for more than £123,000.

Plans to allow filming in the House of Commons are designed to help with repairs to the building, including updates to the heating and electricity

But last week the Commons 
Administration Committee agreed to allow ‘appropriate commercial 
filming’ on days when the House is not sitting.

Officials stressed that the final 
decision will have to be made by Speaker John Bercow and the ruling 
House of Commons Commission.

But one MP said: ‘Each bid for 
filming would have to be assessed on its merits. However, if Steven 
Spielberg turns up offering us a big cheque, and we’re not using the 
building that day, it would be silly to turn it down. The money will 
come in useful for all the repairs.’

Other Whitehall buildings are already
 hired out, including the Treasury’s circular court, which was recently 
used as an underground nightclub in Fast Six, the latest in the Fast And
 The Furious film series.

The Department of Energy and Climate 
Change, which  has spectacular views of the capital, was also used in 
the James Bond blockbuster Skyfall. But last night, one  senior Tory MP 
raised doubts over the Commons film plan.

Former defence Minister Sir Gerald 
Howarth said: ‘There is an aura and mystique about Parliament which we 
must be very careful not to damage. We are trustees of one of the most 
iconic and famous buildings in the world.’

He also warned that there would be ‘security implications’ over letting commercial film directors inside.
