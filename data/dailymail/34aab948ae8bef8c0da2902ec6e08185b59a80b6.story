Sherri Shepherd's surrogate gave birth to a baby boy in Pennsylvania on Tuesday.

The 47-year-old was not present but her estranged husband Lamar Sally was at the hospital, according to TMZ.

The child has been at the centre of a bitter row and legal dispute between the former couple.

Shepherd has no genetic connection to the infant who was conceived through IVF with an egg donor and her estranged husband's sperm.

'Sherri doesn't want anything to do with the child and refuses to pay any child support,' FOX411 has also reported. 'She is not budging and is completely detached. She feels very just in her actions and claims the child is not hers.'
