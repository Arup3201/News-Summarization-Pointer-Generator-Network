Police arrested a prominent former Canadian Broadcasting Corp. radio host on sexual assault charges on Wednesday.

Toronto police said in a statement that former CBC star radio host Jian Ghomeshi has been charged with four counts of sexual assault and one count of what they called 'overcome resistance — choking.'

The allegations, first reported in the media in October, rocked the Canadian public broadcaster, a vaunted Canadian institution.

Jian Ghomeshi, a prominent former Canadian Broadcast Corp. radio host, was charged with four counts of sexual assault on Wednesday

Ghomeshi, 47, was released Wednesday afternoon on $100,000. He was told he must stay in Canada and live with his mother, reports Mashable.

He had hosted 'Q', a CBC radio show on culture, since 2007. His show was also heard on National Public Radio and Public Radio International stations in the U.S.

Ghomeshi arrived at a Toronto courthouse in the back of police car ahead of what's expected to be a brief appearance.

Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair declined comment earlier, saying the matter is now before the courts.

CBC fired Ghomeshi in October, saying his firing was prompted by the emergence of 'graphic' evidence that he had caused physical injury to a person.

Ghomeshi defended his actions in a 1,500- word statement on Facebook then, saying he had consensual 'rough sex' with women and is the victim of a disgruntled ex-girlfriend. 

After the Toronto Star reported several more allegations days later, Ghomeshi posted that he would confront the allegations 'directly,' but wouldn't discuss them with the media.

Police urged in late October for other women to come forward. Police began the investigation after nine victims had contacted various media sources to report incidents of assault and sexual assault involving Ghomeshi.

One of the women who contacted police was actress Lucy DeCoutere, a star of the long-running TV and film series 'Trailer Park Boys.'

DeCoutere, who also serves as a captain in the Royal Canadian Air Force, was the first woman who made allegations against Ghomeshi to speak on the record about her experience. 

DeCoutere said she went on a date with him and alleges that when they returned to his home, he pressed her up against a wall, choked her and slapped her across the face several times.

Author and lawyer Reva Seth became the second woman to go public, writing in the Huffington Post that Ghomeshi put his hands around her throat and sexually assaulted her, although it was not known if she was one of the women who filed a complaint to police against Ghomeshi.

Seth described in the blog how Ghomeshi was 'funny and charming,' when the pair first started seeing each other casually.

But one evening, she claims, his behaviour suddenly changed.

She wrote: 'When it was over, I got up and it was clear I was really angry. My sexual interactions until then had always been consensual, enjoyable and fun.

'He gave me some weird lines about how he couldn't tell if I was actually attracted to him or not. And somehow this was meant to explain his behaviour.'

Afterwards she decided not to involve the police and opted not to come forward fearing the impact of online trolls.

But she eventually decided to reveal her identity after hearing Lucy DeCoutere speaking on CBC about her 'remarkably similar experience'.

None of the allegations from any of the women have been proven. Ghomeshi's lawyer didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

After he was fired, Ghomeshi launched a $55-million lawsuit against the CBC for breach of confidence and defamation. He dropped that lawsuit Tuesday. A union grievance alleging dismissal without proper cause remains.
