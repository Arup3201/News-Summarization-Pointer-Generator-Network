A U.S. army officer who tried to escape being jailed by blaming his twin brother for a string of sex offenses in three states has pleaded guilty to the crimes.

Lt Aaron Lucas initially claimed that he was being framed for trying to abduct 11 young girls and sexually assaulting three others close to his military base in Fort Carson, Colorado.

Instead, he tried to blame his twin Brian Lucas with whom he shares the same DNA.

But the artillery officer, who was awarded the Bronze Star for valor, has now pleaded guilty to the charges according to the El Paso County district attorney's office.

Change of plea: Decorated artillery officer Lt Aaron Lucas, left, of Fort Carson, Colorado, initially blamed his twin brother Brian, right, for a series of sex offenses but has now pleaded guilty

Lucas was arrested last year in connection with a child abduction and an attempted child abduction over the summer.

But detectives realized the 32-year-old matched the description of a suspect in as many as 11 attempted abductions.

DNA taken from an attempted abduction in Colorado matched samples taken from crime scenes in Alabama in 2007 and Texas two years later.

His lawyers were given permission by a district court judge to pursue the claim the DNA was from his twin brother Brian, who lived in both states at the time of the attacks.

But the attorney's office maintained that there was no evidence to back up that claim.

Aaron Lucas' attorneys also claimed that an unidentified third man is responsible for the Colorado assaults.

Ruling: A judge had ruled that Lucas's lawyers could pursue the mistaken identity claim

But the army officer will serve 20 years to life for the assaults after his legal team reached a plea agreement with prosecutors which was approved by a judge.

The Colorado Springs Gazette has quoted Lucas's lawyer as saying that the mistaken identity claim was a 'legal, tactical decision'.

He added: 'He loves his family. He doesn't want to create problems for them.'

El Paso County prosecutors had said that the Colorado victims' ages ranged from six to nine and that they were targeted at random in Colorado Springs and nearby Fountain by a man who tried to coax them into sex with promises of money and ice cream.

Prosecutors contend three girls were assaulted during the encounters.

The incidents began shortly after Aaron Lucas' arrival at Fort Carson with the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division.

A Colorado Springs police detective, Fred Walker, has testified the assaults stopped while Aaron Lucas was deployed to Afghanistan.

Lucas received 
the Bronze Star, the fourth-highest honor given to members of the 
military, for valor during a deployment to Afghanistan.

In his four years of active duty, Lucas amassed a glowing military resume including 10 medals and awards.

He was due to go on trial in January, but will now be sentenced on Friday.
