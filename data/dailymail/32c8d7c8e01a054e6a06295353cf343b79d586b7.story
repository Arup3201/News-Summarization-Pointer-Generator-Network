A couch that can store up to 30 rifles and with cushions that can stop a .44 Magnum bullet at point blank range is now available in America.

The world's first 'CouchBunker' comes complete with bullet-proof cushions fitted with straps so they can be worn as armour when on the move.

It sounds like something from a Hollywood film, but the fire-proof weapon-store is now available to buy, in a range of colours and materials, for a mere $6,700.

Don't be fooled: It may look like a regular couch, but this piece of furniture can store up to 30 rifles and those soft-looking cushions can stop a 44 Magnum at point blank range

The 'CouchBunker' is available in a wide range of styles, leather and fabric coverings, 'creating choices from game room casual to living room formal,' the company says.

But those living in an apartment without an elevator may want to consider the logistics of how to get the 900lb couch into their home.

Manufacturer Charles Alan Inc., in Fort Worth, Texas, US, will build your bespoke fire-rated, weapon-storage couch to order. 

The hidden safe, which is the size of 1/2
a queen sized bed is lined with a two-hour fire wall, is manufactured 
by Heracles Corporation, owner of the BedBunker system.

The vault is quick and easy to access, they say, under the sofa cushions, with one key opening the double lock.

Inside, up to 30 rifles can be stored - enough to arm a small insurgency.

The company says on its website: 'The CouchBunker is ideal for home, office or apartment.'

It
continues that, in addition to being an 'attractive, comfortable couch,
with cleverly disguised, full-size vault,' it also makes 'a comfortable
guest bed'.

It is also available in a light weight line, in various configurations, for boats and RVs.

'No one would ever know that they were looking at, sitting or sleeping on a "gold mine",' the company adds.

Disguise: Guests will never know they are sitting on a 'gold mine', the company adds

Product inventor/designer John Adrain, CEO of Heracles Research Corporation Spokane, Washington, conceived the idea at the request of a client looking for a creative  way to place a high capacity, hidden gun safe in his condo floor plan.  

Heracles also produces the BedBunker, SUV ConsoleBunker, and TruckBunker. In addition, the company builds custom safes for other needs. Heracles was formed in 2007 to provide 'innovative solutions to critical safe storage and other personal security needs'.
