A town which holds a service every time a soldier is killed in Afghanistan stood still today to honour tragic Lee Rigby.

For the past three years, silence has descended upon the small town of Sedgefield, in County Durham, each time the body of a dead soldier has been repatriated.

The services, held by the Sedgefield Veterans, take place on the village green where poems are read out beneath a union jack flag, lowered to half mast.

Tribute: A memorial service is held in Sedgefield, County Durham, for murdered soldier Lee Rigby

Mark of respect: The Sedgefield Veterans hold a service for every serving solider who dies on duty with today's service passing over 250 since 2009

Emotional: Dozens attended the service, with many weeping as one single bugle sounded out across the village green outside St Edmund’s church

Usually, the services are held only when a soldier, or group of soldiers, are killed in Afghanistan.

But on learning of the horrific death of Drummer Rigby, 25, of the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, on the streets of London, the Sedgefield Veterans decided to make an exception.

Dozens attended the morning service, with many weeping as one single bugle sounded out across the village green outside St. Edmund’s church.

The Sedgefield Veterans have held in excess of 250 services for dead soldiers since they first began around three years ago.

Veteran Timothy Spearey, 64, of Sedgefield, said: 'It might be a slightly unusual thing to do, but we want to show the families of dead soldiers our support.

'Normally we hold services for soldiers who have been killed during service in Afghanistan, but we were moved by what happened to Lee Rigby, and wanted to show our solidarity.

'The Sedgefield Veterans are all ex forces, and we believe in offering as much support to the armed forces as we can.

'The services are usually very well attended and are moving. We lower the flag to half mast, read out the dead soldier’s name and then a poem.'
