A federal probe has revealed a staggering 26 percent increase in employee misconduct within the beleagured Transportation Security Administration over the last three years, as more workers have been caught stealing from luggage,  sleeping on the job and engaging in abusive behavior. 

The report by the Government Accountability Office found misconduct cases rose from 2,691 a year in 2010 to 3,408 in 2012. The TSA has roughly 56,000 employees.

About a third of the cases involved being late or not reporting to work, while a quarter involved screening and security failures, such as sleeping on the job, according to CNN.

Ten percent of the cases involved inappropriate comments or abusive behavior.

'These findings are especially hard to stomach since so many Americans today are sick of being groped, interrogated and treated like criminals when passing through checkpoints, Rep. Jeff Duncan, a South Caroline Republican, told USAToday. 'Stop with the napping, the stealing, the tardiness and the disrespect.'

About one in five workers was fired as a result of their misconduct while nearly half given a letter of reprimand, which can prevent employees from receiving a bonus or promotion. Other forms of punishment included temporary suspensions.

Overall, among the 9,622 offenses detailed in the report, roughly 1,900 were labeled as security threats, 384 were found to be ethics and integrity violations and 56 cases involved theft. 

In one case detailed by the GAO, a 
TSA agent was suspended for seven days for trying to carry a relative's 
bag past security, so it wouldn't get flagged for the numerous 
prohibited items inside. The report did not specify what those items 
were. 

'There’s not even a way to properly 
report some of the offenses, so this may be just the tip of the iceberg 
of some of the offenses,' Rep. John Mica, a Florida Republican, told 
CNN.

TSA Deputy Administrator John 
Halinski told lawmakers that the agency is working to better monitor the
cases and how employees are punished.

'I've
given you my word – if they're stealing, doing drugs or breaching the 
security system intentionally and I can prove it, they're out,' Halinski
told a House Homeland Security subcommittee hearing.

Pythias Brown, a former TSA agent who spent three years in jail for stealing from 
passenger luggage, told ABC News in September 2012 that robbing luggage 'was very 
commonplace.'

Brown, who worked at Newark International Airport,
said he stole more than $800,000 worth of goods from luggage and 
security checkpoints over the course of four years. He was finally caught when he tried to sell a 
stolen CNN camera that was later tracked down because he forgot to remove the stickers that 
tied the camera to the news network.

In another case that was covered nationally, federal officials arrested several Transportation Security Administration screeners in April 2012 for allegedly taking part in a scheme to let large amounts of marijuana and narcotics pass through X-ray machines in security checkpoints at Los Angeles International Airport.
