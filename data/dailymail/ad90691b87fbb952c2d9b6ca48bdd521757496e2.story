The grieving mother of murdered schoolgirl Tia Sharp has spoken of the agony of losing her child and of her torment after sick trolls pretended to have taken her daughter.

Natalie Sharp, 30, said in the days leading up to the discovery of her daughter's death, people began calling her partner's mobile phone saying they had 12-year-old Tia.

Speaking publicly for the first time, Natalie also told how she had desperately hoped her daughter would be found but as time went by, she knew in her heart that she wouldn't be.

She told The Sun newspaper: 'It has been pure hell. You see yourself become the family everyone watches on the news.'

Natalie and partner David Niles, 29, also said their two sons, aged three and one still do not know their sister is dead.

Police launched a 100-strong manhunt after the disappearance of Tia in August, with members of the public joining in with extensive searches to help find her.

Her body was eventually found wrapped in a sheet inside a plastic bag in the loft of her grandmother's home in New Addington, South London, more than a week after she went missing.

This was despite police visiting her grandmother's terraced property four times.

Tia, who lived 10 miles away in Mitcham
with her mother and her partner David 
would often spend weekends with her grandmother.

Tia's grandmother, Christine, 46, was arrested in connection with Tia's death and is on bail.

Christine's partner, Stuart Hazell, 37, is due to appear at the Old Bailey on November 19 accused of the child's murder.

In the days leading up to the discovery of Tia's body, the ordeal suffered by Natalie and David was worsened when callers began taunting the couple.

David was out searching for Tia's body, after she had been missing for around three days, when he got the first call on his mobile by a couple of boys who had seen his number on the T-shirts he wore for the TV appeals.

He said: 'They were saying, "We've got her and we'll tell you where and when you can have her".'

Police traced the call back to Scotland where they discovered it was a couple of drunk boys making prank calls. Natalie added: 'It wasn't the only time. We had lots of false messages'.

They also told The Sun how they don't know how they are going to be able to tell Tia's younger brothers she is dead.

Solemn: Tia Sharp's coffin arrives at Morden Cemetery last week for the funeral service of the schoolgirl

Natalie said: 'One of them has already started to notice. He's called out to a few girls in the street, thinking it's Tia.'

Last week the couple said goodbye to Tia at a private funeral service in South London.

Tia's coffin was covered in red and pink hearts and a pink feather bower. A sign saying 'little angel' rested on top.
