The 76-year-old stepfather of Prince Harry's girlfriend died overdosing on a prescription drug, toxicology tests have revealed.

Former merchant banker Christopher Shaw was the fourth husband of Cressida Bonas's mother, Lady Mary Gaye Curzon, and played a big part in her upbringing until she was 11.

They split up in 2000 after an unhappy four-year marriage.

It is the end of an agonising seven week wait to see why Mr Shaw, who celebrated his 76th birthday on New Yearâ€™s Day, died so suddenly.

An inquest in Salisbury, Wiltshire, was told a post mortem examination had shown his death was not natural.

The cause of death was discovered by toxicology tests.

The inquest heard he was found in January in his bedroom of his rented home at The Close, near Salisbury Cathedral in Wiltshire, by housekeeper Nicola Smith.

He was dead at the scene. She identified him.

Last month Cressida was pictured arm-in-arm with her half-brother Jacobi Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe at Mr Shaw's funeral at Hinton Ampner Church in Hampshire.

The first thing 24-year-old dance graduate Cressida did when she entered the church was warmly embrace his housekeeper.

The son of a country parson and a former head boy at Eton, father-of-three Shaw lived with Mary Gaye at the sprawling National Trust mansion Hinton Ampner in Hampshire, where he entertained in style with eight servants and five gardeners.

He also had a set in the Albany building. Guests at his parties included Sir Richard Branson and Rupert Murdoch.

Shaw was married first to banker Loel 
Guinnessâ€™s niece Liza Gard, then to a Frenchwoman, and fell for 
thrice-married Mary Gaye in 1994. They were together for six years, 
married for four, but divorced in 2000.

Wiltshire Coroner David Ridley adjourned the inquest to a date to be fixed.

After he was found in January Mr Ridley ordered an investigation into his death

It had been thought he may have died from natural causes.

But the inquest was eventually ordered several weeks later because his death was 'unnatural'.
