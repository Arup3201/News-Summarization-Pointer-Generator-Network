A relaxing Sunday on California's ski slopes turned deadly when two people were killed and another person was injured in three separate accidents, according to authorities.

Tim Cohee, the owner and general manager of China Peak Mountain Resort located northeast of Fresno, says a 30-year-old man was snowboarding alone when he fell head-first into the snow and suffocated.

Another visitor to the 
resort spotted the snowboarder and rushed to his aid a few minutes later, but it was too late.

'That's why we always tell people to go with a buddy,' Cohee told the Fresno Bee.

He added that this marked the first death at China Peak so far this year.

In Northern California, a skier identified as 54-year-old Yiwei Hu, of Gold River, died after falling into a hole created by an underflow of water at the Sierra-at-Tahoe Resort.

El Dorado County Sheriff's Lt. Tim Becker said in a statement that Hu was found by other skiers at around 1:43 p.m.  in an expert ski part of the resort.
