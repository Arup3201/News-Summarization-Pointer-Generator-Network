Scout badges have traditionally been 
awarded to youngsters for reaching a certain level of prowess in skills 
such as camping and tying knots.

But
 the modern scout needs modern skills - and the movement is now 
rewarding achievements in fields including fundraising, media relations,
 and sending emails or posting 'selfies' on the internet.

Tasks
 to win the badge range from assessing disability access to public 
buildings, to sending emails and posting photographs on the internet 
appropriately.

There is 
also a badge for 'geocaching', which is similar to orienteering and 
involves locating a series of way points – but using the GPS 
capabilities of a smartphone.

Nineteen
 new badges are being introduced, across all age groups of the Scout 
movement, as part of the biggest overhaul of rewards in almost ten 
years.

The changes are intended to modernise the Scouts, ensuring that the badges better reflect young people's interests.

Nine of the new badges are aimed at Beaver Scouts – with awards for 
disability awareness and an understanding of outer space among them.

The
 communicator badge for Beavers (aged between six and eight) includes a 
requirement to spell your name in semaphore or Morse code, as well as an
 ability to send an email or text message.

The
 launch of these new badges follows an extensive 10-month consultation 
process within and outside the movement, during which the Scout 
Association contacted more than 12,000 members through focus groups, 
surveys, social media and events.

The consultation identified the need to create new badges that allow younger Scouts to develop a wider range of skills.

Traditional
 Scouting skills are not ignored with new badges being made available to 
those who go camping, hike or sleep out under the stars.

Badges
 are now available for those who clock up 200 nights away camping 
throughout their Scout career and for the survival skills badge 
candidates must prepare meat, such as a rabbit or a fish, to cook over 
an open fire and eat.

Leaders
 are told they can use traps or snares, but must be 'made aware of the 
law and issues surrounding inhumanity to animals outside of a real 
survival situation'.

Chief 
Scout Bear Grylls said yesterday: 'We're delighted to be launching a new
 range of badges that guarantee fun and adventure while encouraging 
Scouts to develop a greater understanding of modern society and the 
contribution they can make to society.

'Throughout
 its 107-year history the Scouting movement has continued to evolve – 
these new badges make sure we are able to keep offering activities that 
educate and enthuse young people in equal measure.'
