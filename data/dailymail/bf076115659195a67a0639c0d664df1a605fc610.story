Colin Birdsall, 72, who died when his organs failed was due to be buried in a metal coffin last Thursday

A family were left horrified after council officials turned up at their father's funeral to tell them they couldn't bury him in a metal coffin because they are banned. 

Stella Birdsall, 48, ordered a £3,000, vacuum-sealed, navy blue metal casket with steel handles for her father Colin, 72, but  his funeral in Knottingley, West Yorkshire was halted last Thursday.

She said the service at St Botolph’s Church ‘went beautifully’ but then the official ‘ambushed’ the funeral cortege beside the open grave.

Miss Birdsall, a control room operator, said he told the family that the interment could not go ahead because it breached Wakefield Council’s policy barring the use of metal caskets – and that she had two options, either to postpone the burial or to change the casket. 

‘Everybody was in a state of shock,’ she said. ‘I was dumbfounded.’

'A council official was on the phone in front of the coffin and no one knew what was going on.

'After about 10 minutes, we were told the council wouldn't allow us to bury my dad because his casket was metal.

'We were all in total shock. We were given two options, whether to postpone the burial or to swap dad’s coffin and continue.

'We chose the latter because all the guests were already there, but we never had a choice in the coffin.'

After a hurried discussion, the family decided that the hearse should return to the undertaker’s parlour so that the body could be transferred into a wooden coffin.

She said her father’s body was put in a plain, plywood box which was the only one they had in stock.

'There was then confusion over which way my father was laying and he was spun twice over his own grave,' she added.

'Before we left the cemetery, the bulldozers were already filling in the earth.

'But because the grave was dug for the original metal casket, which was bigger than the one he ended up in, there were two feet spare all the way round the edge.

'There musn’t have been enough soil to properly fill the grave so it had already sunk by the time I visited again on Friday.

'I am devastated and very angry. He was just discarded like a piece of rubbish.

'The whole ordeal was just absolutely disgusting. There was no compassion, respect or dignity. I wanted that day to be perfect because it was the last thing I could have doen for my dad.

'The council ruined that and I can never get that day back. Our lasting memories of dad are of this, it is heartbreaking and has been haunting me ever since.' 

His family were forced to bury him in a wooden coffin at the last minute after they were told by the council at the funeral they could not use the metal one

Her brother Reece Birdsall, 38, said: 'Instead of talking about my dad’s life, people are talking about the utter farce of the funeral. It is a disgrace.'

Miss Birdsall said the way her father- a former contractor - was treated on the day of the funeral was worse than the day he died.

'What happened that day, as horrible as it was, could not have been avoided but what happened at his funeral could have, and should have, been avoided.

'It had gone to far by that point, if they had a problem with the coffin they should have told us before we got to the graveside.'

Their father passed away after a long illness where his organs failed.

Miss Birdsall said she did not blame the undertaker, Jennings Funeral Services, but added: ‘It was like Wakefield Council ambushed my father’s burial.’

Miss Birdsall said she is looking at exhuming her father’s body for reburial in a more suitable coffin. She added: ‘Nobody has been talking about what a beautiful service it was. It has all been about what happened at the graveside.’

Wakefield Council has since apologised for the incident and said it would make arrangements for Mr Birdsall to be reburied in the original metal coffin and would cover the costs.

Glynn Humphries, the council’s service director for environmental and street scene, said: 'We would like to apologise to Ms Birdsall and her family for the distress out actions caused them during what was already a very difficult time.

'Having looked into the issue we could have acted differently and, on this occasion, carried out the family’s wished and given them the funeral they originally planned, including the metal casket.'
