The military is reviewing its new regulations involving soldiers' appearance following criticism that the changes in hair requirements are racially biased.

Earlier this month, the Army issued new
 appearance standards that ban most twists, dreadlocks and large 
cornrows - styles used predominantly by African-American women with 
natural hairstyles. Black women make up a third of the armed forces.

Soldiers are 'not authorized to wear braids, cornrows, or dreadlocks (unkempt, twisted, matted, individual parts of hair) while in uniform, or in civilian clothes on duty,' the guidelines note.

New guidelines: The hair rules for the military are being reviewed after complaints said the banned styles - twists, dreadlocks and large cornrows - are largely used by African-Americans

But Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel called for the review after 16 female members of the Congressional Black Caucus wrote to him, complaining about the updated guidelines.

In their original letter, they wrote: 'Though we 
understand the intent of the updated regulation is to ensure uniformity 
in our military, it is seen as discriminatory rules targeting soldiers 
who are women of color with little regard to what is needed to maintain 
their natural hair.'

They also said that the guidelines calling hairstyles worn mostly by black women 'unkempt' and 'matted' show a lack of 'cultural 
sensitivity'.

'I think that it primarily targets black 
women, and Iâ€™m not in agreement with it,' Patricia Jackson-Kelley from 
the National Association of Black Military Women added to the AP. 'I donâ€™t 
see how a woman wearing three braids in her hair, how that affects her 
ability to perform her duty in the military.'

Under review: The Congressional Black Caucus said they knew the guidelines were meant for uniformity, but that it was discriminatory not to consider what black women might need to maintain their natural hair

Assessment: Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, pictured in Mexico last week, wrote back to the women to say he took the matter seriously and would be holding a review over the next three months

In a response letter, obtained by the Military Times, Hagel wrote: 'I want to assure you that, while none of
 the Army's revised grooming and appearance policies were designed or 
intended to discriminate or disparage against any service members, I 
take your concerns very seriously.'

Pentagon spokesman Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby says Hagel will have the deputy secretary of defense 'work with the service secretaries and military chiefs to review their respective policies' over the next three months.

Each service will review its policy 'as they pertain to African American 
women to ensure standards are fair and respectful of our diverse force, 
while also meeting our military services' requirements', he wrote.

Hagel will then make whatever adjustments
 to the policy are appropriate after the review.
