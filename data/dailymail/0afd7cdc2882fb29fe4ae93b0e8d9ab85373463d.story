These are the stunning scenes of famous cities that make landmarks in London and far away destinations look like toy towns.

New York photographer Richard Silver took photographs of commuters and day trippers mingling on streets before using digital photograph technology to give them a 'tilt-shift' effect. The effect makes cars, public transport and people look like figures in fantastic landscapes used for toys.

Richard, 52, said, 'Position wise I need to be high up like on top of a building, mountain or hill. Taking the photograph takes seconds, post processing takes about 15 minutes [for] each photograph using Photoshop.

'There is an actual lens that is called tilt-shift, I choose not to use it and do all of my tilt shifting in post-production. 

'After doing this for almost six years now I know exactly what and how to photograph.

'I travel around for work so for me to do this project – it is something that I almost feel the need to do. I try to Tilt-Shift every place I travel to.'

The photographer has captured St Mark's Square in Venice, Westminster in London, Krakow in Poland and Rome's Colosseum and the Vatican, among others in a new light. 

Richard was inspired by Olivo Barbieri, an Italian photographer and says his Tilt-Shift work 'blew me away so much that I figured out how to shoot similar to his style'.

Richard works with an international gallery based in Paris called YELLOWKORNER, who display his extraordinary work.

Toy town: London's famous landmark is dwarfed in photographer Richard Silver's work. The tilt-shift effect makes vehicles, people and buildings look like toys

The Great Wall of China: Tiny figures dot along the famous wall, and dwarf trees and shrubs look unreal. The style allows the viewer to look at familiar sights in a whole new light 

St Mark's Square, Venice: In order to achieve this effect, Mr Silver has to position himself high on top of a building, mountain or hill

It's hard to believe that this scene of Mexico's stunning Tulum beach is real and full-size. The sea and surrounding landscape look almost make-believe and the people look like dolls

Optical illusion in Singapore: Mr Silver said that it only takes seconds to take each photography but post-production using Photoshop software can take 15 minutes

Austria's Belvedere Palace: Mr Silver was inspired by Italian artist and photographer Olivo Barbieri who is well-known for this style of shooting

Lake Titicaca, Peru: The majestic lake and its sprawling surroundings are, if possible, even more mesmerising in miniature

Amsterdam's beauty is magically transformed using the method.  'I try to Tilt-Shift every place I travel to,' Mr Silver said. Barges look like toy models and the buildings like they're made of Lego 

The Vatican and its constant swarm of visitors if completely is altered in Mr Silver's photo. The Brooklyn native has been working on this form of photography for almost six years

Krakow, Poland: The Tilt-Shift effect makes cars, public transport and people look like figures in fantastic landscapes used for toys

Dubai Mall: Mr Silver took photographs of commuters and day trippers mingling on streets before using digital photograph technology to give them a 'tilt-shift' effect

St Mark's Square: Little people holding miniscule umbrellas feeding tiny pigeons. Just a normal day in Venice but seen from a different perspective

Krakow: Traditionally this perspective was acheived using a tilt-shift lens but Mr Silver chose to do all of his tilt shifting in post-production

The big picture: Rome's Colosseum looks like a model in a museum. Mr Silver needs his subject to 'sort of line up' for him
