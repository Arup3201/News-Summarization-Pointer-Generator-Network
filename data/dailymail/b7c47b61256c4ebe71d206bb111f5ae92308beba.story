STANLEY I RESUME: FURTHER RECOLLECTIONS OF AN EXUBERANT LIFE  By Stanley Johnson (Robson Press £25)

The start of the second volume of Stanley Johnson’s memoirs finds him alone in his house in Exmoor on his 40th birthday having just been dumped by his American girlfriend, Bobby.

Sitting at the kitchen table, feeling uncharacteristically glum, he tries to work out what, if anything, he ever did for her. At first his mind is blank. Then, with a tiny glimmer of pride, he remembers that he once helped her to resurface a tennis court.

Later on, to buck himself up, Johnson goes off to do a bit of tree-trimming with a chain-saw. ‘I decided to attack a large, solid branch some 20 feet off the ground. Unfortunately, it happened to be the one I was sitting on.’

Some people, rather unkindly, have suggested that Stanley is a paler version of his son, Boris but it seems he is in a class of his own

Some people, rather unkindly, have suggested that Stanley is a paler version of his son, Boris — a kind of early draft of the real thing. But as swiftly becomes clear, when it comes to inserting every last millimetre of his foot into his mouth, Stanley is in a class of his own.

To begin with at least, barely a page goes by without some example of his forgetfulness, clumsiness, or incompetence, all driven home with a liberal smattering of exclamation marks.

Soon after Bobby dumps him, he meets his new next-door neighbour in London — a slim, dark-haired woman called Jenny. Keen to ingratiate himself, Johnson offers to take her two dogs for a walk. Within seconds of letting the dogs out of the car, he manages to lose them both. Jenny, however, is evidently the forgiving type. Not long afterwards, they get married.

Stanley pictured in 1980. Much of Johnson’s life has passed in a chaotically unreflective whirl, unimpeded by any self-doubt, he does have his serious side

When he takes his children on a motor boat, the engine drops off; when he helps himself to a midnight snack at the house of some friends, he destroys their fridge; when he’s asked to come out to Nairobi to do a piece on animal migration, he gets on a flight to Houston instead.

But while much of Johnson’s life has passed in a chaotically unreflective whirl, unimpeded by any twinge of self-doubt, he does have his serious side. As he’s keen to remind us, he was an MEP for five years, sitting in ‘the second-safest Euro seat in the EU’, and when he was in Brussels, he proposed several important pieces of legislation, all to do with animal welfare.

If you’re going to read about the inner workings of the EU, then Stanley Johnson is probably as good a guide as any. Even so, there are several times here when his normally bouncy prose style seems to have put on a large pair of diving boots. ‘I have already mentioned that I was responsible for drafting the European Community’s Fourth Environmental Action Programme (4EAP),’ he notes at one point. Indeed you have, indeed you have . . .

Mercifully we don’t stay stuck in the EU quagmire for too long. Inbetween drafting environmental legislation, Johnson writes a number of novels — one of which, The Doomsday Deposit, must be a leading candidate for the most unappealing title ever published. Another, The Commissioner, was made into a film starring John Hurt. ‘You can still buy the video on Amazon,’ he notes helpfully.

But anyone who thinks that writing a novel automatically involves being plunged into creative agonies should think again. Rather than sit down and sweat at a desk, ‘I bought a pocket Dictaphone and spouted away in taxis or airport lounges’. Not surprisingly, the results were somewhat patchy: ‘Once I even forgot what sex one of the key protagonists was.’

Although it seems barely credible, Johnson won the Newdigate Prize for poetry when he was at Oxford. His fondness for versifying has not dwindled with the years and he includes some examples of his efforts here. I’ll spare you these on humanitarian grounds, but suffice it to say that the Poet Laureate, Carol Ann Duffy, is unlikely to be shaking in her shoes.

Johnson and his wife Jenny who he met after offering to take her dogs out for a walk, but then lost both of them

Along the way he manages to father another two children, to go with the four that he had with his first wife. It comes as no surprise to learn that Johnson couldn’t remember their names when he was being interviewed on live TV, prompting one of his daughters to burst into tears.

‘How could you, Dada?’ she sobbed. ‘How could you forget our names like that?’

Johnson has a spasm of guilt, but like any dark cloud in his life it soon passes and his normal sunny surface is resumed.

As for his theories on child care, these seem unlikely to find much favour with Dr Maggie Atkinson, the Children’s Commissioner for England: ‘Having had a great deal of experience of such matters, I have long since concluded that there is absolutely no need to be within earshot of young children.’

But he’s clearly done something right. All his children seem cheerful, bright and well-adjusted, albeit hell-bent on world domination.

The ambition, as far as he can tell, comes from Stanley’s French mother, who taught him that ‘basically anything was do-able and that, as she would put it, there is no such word as can’t’.

By the end of this maddeningly uneven yet still thoroughly engaging book, Johnson has brought his story up to date. At 74, there is no dimming of the light, still less any desire to slip into the shadows. Recently, he and the former BBC foreign correspondent Kate Adie were guests on the TV game show Pointless, which, he writes, ‘goes out at 5.15 every afternoon and apparently has between five and six million viewers’.

And then he can’t resist adding: ‘We very much hope to be invited back.’
