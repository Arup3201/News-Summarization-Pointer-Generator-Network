It could mean the end for lightbulbs - and turn any object in your home into a light.

Researchers have revealed lightpaper, a way to print sheets of 'paper' infused with tiny LEDs.

They say it can be applied to walls, and even printed onto other objects - turning anything into a light.

 Idaho researchers have revealed lightpaper, a way to print sheets of 'paper' infused with tiny LEDs - and it can even be used to print wallpaper that doubles as a light.

Lightpaper is manufactured by mixing ink and tiny LEDs together and printing them out on a conductive layer. It can even be used as wallpaper

Lightpaper is manufactured by mixing ink and tiny LEDs together and printing them out on a conductive layer. 

That object is then sandwiched between two other layers and sealed. 

The tiny diodes are about the size of a red blood cell, and randomly dispersed on the material. 

When current runs through the diodes, they light up. 

The breakthrough has been likened to the emergence of 3D printing, and the firm behind it admits even it isn't sure how it will be used. 

The world's thinnest light, it is printed and flexible, Rohini, the firm behind it says.

'Today's lighting methods require soldering LED to circuit boards - now you can just print light on what you want'.

The firm has shown off wallpaper , car logos and even snowboards with display using the paper built in.

'With Lightpaper it's more of a platform of light that we don't even know how it's going to be used,' Rohinni CMO Nick Smoot told Fastco.

'All we know is that we're trying to unlock the ability to create light.'

 'The magical thing about this solution is it's brighter, it's thinner, it's flexible, it's addressable, and programmable. 

'You can address the sections of the diodes, which is a whole other space when you start thinking about solutions of light that you can address sections of,' he said.

'Anywhere there is a light, this could replace that.'
