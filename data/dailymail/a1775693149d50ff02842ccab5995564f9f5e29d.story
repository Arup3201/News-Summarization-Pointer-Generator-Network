Authorities say they have discovered an incomplete smuggling tunnel along the U.S.-Mexico border in Nogales, Arizona.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection says the unfinished tunnel was found this week during a joint effort by U.S. and Mexican authorities.

Authorities noticed freshly disturbed dirt within the channel floor of a drainage system near a port of entry in Nogales.

Unfinished: The tunnel extends 133 feet into the United States from Mexico

Discovery: The tunnel was discovered Wednesday, in Nogales, west of the DeConcini Port, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection

They later discovered a tunnel that begins in Mexico and extends 133 feet into the U.S., but it did not yet have an opening from the ground.

The tunnel is three-foot-high, meaning anyone intending to use it would have to crawl on hands and knees.

According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesperson Nicole Ballistera, the tunnel was discovered in a routine patrol.

She said its root was only seven feet into Mexico but extended 133 feet into the United States.

As U.S. border security has surged on land, drug cartels have turned to the sky, sea and tunneling beneath the ground to avoid detection.

By chance: Authorties noticed fresh dirt within the floor of a drainage system led them to the tunnel

Incomplete: The three-foot high tunnel did not yet have an opening in the U.S.

More than 75 such underground passages have been found along the border since 2008, concentrated largely in California and Arizona.

In December, authorities reported another tunnel, also in Nogales.

In November 2013, a sophisticated tunnel was found that ran from near Tijuana airport to San Diego.

It was fitted out with an electric rail system, ventilation and lighting.

Authorities seized eight-and-a-half tons of marijuana and 327lb of cocaine in connection with the tunnel's discovery.
