Jawaid Ishaq, 72, who lives in Scunthorpe but is originally from Kuwait, is accused of stealing £124,000 from sick friend Ali Salem Sultan

A serving Labour councillor and former town mayor who helped to organise the Queen's first visit to a UK mosque has gone on trial accused of fraud and theft.

Jawaid Ishaq, 72,  originally from Kuwait, moved to this country in 1970 and went on to become town mayor of Scuthorpe, deputy chairman of Humberside Police, and was awarded an MBE. 

But today he was accused of stealing £124,000 from a sick and elderly friend as part of a fraud lasting for 15 years.

Sheffield Crown Court was told that Ishaq began his deception in 1997 when Ali Salem Sultan, a close friend of his who used to go to his shop and attended mosque with him, retired.

Mr Sultan, who was then 72 but who has since died,  wanted to return to his native country of Yemen where his wife and children lived.

However, he owned several assets in Scunthorpe, including two rental properties, which he wanted Ishaq to look after.

On July 7 the former steelworks painter drew up a legal power of attorney which granted Ishaq the power to collect rent on the properties and maintain them.

This paper clearly stated it applied to 'no other assets whatsoever', but some time later Ishaq is alleged to have created a handwritten forgery.

This second document gave him access to all of Mr Sultan's stocks bank accounts, and pension.

Craig Hassall, prosecuting, said Ishaq then used the forged document to sell all of Mr Sultan's shares, and withdraw his pension in cash every week.

Meanwhile, in Yemen, Mr Sultan became aware of the deception in 2001 after he had trouble accessing his Halifax bank account, Mr Hassall said.

Despite falling gravely ill and having to have his leg amputated, Mr Sultan began writing letters to the bank, urging them to give him control of his accounts back, it was claimed.

However the jury heard that back in Britain Ishaq had instructed the bank to ignore any letters being sent from Mr Sultan in Yemen.

Mr Hassall said: 'His attempts to have his pension paid into his bank account in Yemen were thwarted by the defendant.

'Pension payments were paid in to a new account and were being withdrawn by the defendant in cash on a regular basis.'

Eventually Mr Sultan tried to draw up a new power of attorney with his son, who lives in New York, but this had little or no effect, Mr Hassall added.

Ishaq has been a Labour councillor since 1983, served as mayor of Scunthorpe in 2008, was deputy chairman of Humberside Police, and organised the Queen's first visit to a UK mosque (pictured, Ishaq third left)

Ishaq became a Labour councillor in 1983 in Scunthorpe while the fraud was going on, then served as chairman of the South Humber Racial Equality Council and held the position of former deputy chairman of Humberside Police Authority.

He was also awarded an MBE in 2000 for services to community relations, and is still serving as a councillor on North Lincolnshire Council.

Mr Hassall said: 'Clearly he was and still is a prominent and influential person in the community as well as the Muslim community in North Lincolnshire.

'This meant people trusted him and were less inclined to check what he was telling them if he had not held such positions of power.'

When police raided Ishaq's house in October 2012 they found the handwritten power of attorney, which was dated just eight days after the original was drawn up.

However, it had a stamp from a solicitor's firm on it featuring a name that the company did not adopt until 2004. It also had two signatures, whereas the law only requires one.

Mr Hassall said: 'It makes no sense that a second power was granted just days after the first one when [Mr Sultan] had been so careful to limit the powers to just the two houses.

Sheffield Crown Court was told Ishaq forged a will of attorney and used it to sell Mr Sultan's stocks, withdraw his pension, and access his bank account after he retired to his home country of Yemen

'The second one is hand-written and there’s nothing in it that says a legally qualified person had anything to do with it. And the legal stamp must have been applied eight years later.'

Ishaq is charged with four offences of fraud, four of theft, one of forgery, and of obtaining a money transfer by deception.

He is also accused of two charges of using a false instrument with intent, making or supplying articles for use in fraud, possessing an article for use in fraud and perverting the course of justice.

He denies all of the charges against him. The trial, which is expected to last four weeks, continues.
