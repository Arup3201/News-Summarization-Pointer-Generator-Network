Burnis Hurd, 44, of Richmond, California, is accused of attacking an 11-year-old student on a school bus because he believed the boy was bullying his 9-year-old son

A father has been accused of attacking and threatening to kill an 11-year-old boy who he believed had been bullying his autistic son.

Burnis Hurd, 44, is said to have followed his son onto a school bus in the Bay Area suburb of Richmond, California, before the nine-year-old pointed out the boy who he said had been bullying him.

'The father grabbed the 11-year old by the hair, pulled hard and raised the child out of his seat, then shoved him on the side of the bus where the window meets the wall,' Richmond Police Lt. Mark Gagan told CBS San Francisco.

Gagan said Hurd also threatened to kill the student during the incident on Friday, May 30.

Hurd has now been charged with child abuse and corporal injury to a child.

He remained in jail on Monday on $50,000 bond, according to The Daily Caller.

Both of the students reportedly attend a special education programme at a school in Richmond.

Last month it was reported children as young as kindergarten-age could face misdemeanor charges for bullying under a proposed law advancing in the Southern California city of Carson.

The Carson City Council gave preliminary approval early in May to an ordinance aimed at persons, including other youths, who cause anyone from kindergarten to age 25 to feel terrorized, harassed or threatened with no legitimate purpose.

The legislation, which would have made Carson the first city in California to criminalize bullying, was however narrowly voted down by the city council by 3-2 on May 20, according to myfoxla.com.

The legislation would have meant first-time offenders could have been ticketed for an infraction and fined $100.

A second infraction would have cost $200, and a third-time offense could have brought a criminal misdemeanor charge.

Meanwhile, it was reported yesterday that a 33-year-old man had been accused of throwing the punch which sparked a 20-strong brawl during a kindergarten graduation ceremony in an unrelated incident.

Raymond Walker allegedly hit another man in the cafeteria of Cincinnati's Mt Healthy North Elementary School, as newly graduated five-year-olds snacked on punch and cookies on Monday morning.

The domestic dispute allegedly triggered a violent melee which shut down the school and ruined the special day of the little children.

Amid the panic, Mt. Healthy Schools Superintendent Lori Handler ordered a lockdown to ensure no one else wandered into the fight scene.
