A pistol and other possessions belonging to a one-time Old West outlaw who later ran for governor of Oklahoma and also became an actor are going up for auction next month.

The .45 Colt revolver owned by infamous outlaw Alphonzo 'Al' J. Jennings could go for as much as $30,000 during an auction June 5 in Woodward, said Ira Smith, auctioneer with Smith & Co. Auction and Reality Inc.

Jennings was born in Virginia in 1863 and moved to El Reno, Oklahoma, where he became the prosecuting attorney for Canadian County, according to the Oklahoma Historical Society.

Al Jennings - pictured here in the Winter of 1913-1914 - was an attorney in Oklahoma Territory who at one time robbed trains. He later became a silent film star. A pistol and other possessions belonging to him are going up for auction next month

Prized possession: The .45 Colt revolver owned by famed outlaw and one-time candidate for Oklahoma governor Alphonzo 'Al' J. Jennings before his death in 1961 will under the hammer in Woodward on June 5

In 1895, he joined his two brothers in a law practice in Woodward. Later that year, one brother was killed and another wounded in a shootout with a rival attorney.

Jennings later formed an outlaw band that attempted to rob trains and general stores before he was captured and sentenced to life in prison.

One of his brothers got his sentence reduced, and Jennings was released just a few years later.

He ran unsuccessfully for Oklahoma governor in 1914 and then moved to California, where he appeared in at least two westerns before dying in 1961.

'Al Jennings is probably one of the most enigmatic characters in Oklahoma history,' Oklahoma Historical Society executive director Bob Blackburn said.

'He was a potential candidate for governor, so he had a professional side to him — an ambition to be accepted by the community — and at the same time, he had this urge to get rich quick.

'He was not successful at either one.'

In 1897 Jennings and joined a gang of bandits and robbed trains, general stores and a post office, with little monetary success. In 1899 he was sentenced to life in prison but, due to the legal efforts of his brother John, the sentence was reduced to five years

Blackburn said Jennings was probably most successful at getting into the movie business.

After
 Jennings' death, his possessions, including the pistol, trickled down 
through family members, who have now decided to put up the items at a 
public auction.

Other items 
include a picture of Jennings attending Wyatt Earp's funeral, a poster 
from his failed attempt to become governor and a book signed by 
President Harry Truman, said Karen Rampy, Jennings' great-great niece.

The auction will be streamed online, too, Smith said.

'It's
 hard to put a value on this thing, but in my mind — which I've been in 
this business 32 years so I've watched this happen before — that gun 
could easily bring $20,000 to $30,000.

'(But) you never know at a public auction,' he said.
