The jailed Australian wife of a murdered millionaire podiatrist blew kisses to her supporters during a court appearance in the Bahamas.

Donna Vasyli, who is charged with stabbing her husband Phillip Vasyli to death at their Caribbean home in the exclusive gated community of Old Fort Bay, told family and friends: ‘I’ll be out.’

Mr Vasyli, 59, also an Australian, was found lifeless in the dining room of the luxury home with multiple stab wounds.

During the court hearing on Monday Chief Magistrate Joyann Ferguson-Pratt told Vasyli, 54, she was ‘not required to enter a plea in this matter’.

Flanked by security personnel, Donna Vasyli is taken to court in the Bahamas where she was later accused of her husband Philip's murder

‘It is claimed that you, on Tuesday, February 24, at New Providence, by means of unlawful harm, did intentionally cause the death of Phillip Vasyli,’ Chief Magistrate Ferguson-Pratt said, The Bahamas' Tribune newspaper reported.

The judge denied Vasyli bail and scheduled her to reappear in the court on May 20, but she could apply to the Supreme Court for bail.

Mr Vasyli was the owner of multiple podiatry clinics around the world and also founded an orthotic footwear company that sells Vionic with Orthaheel Technology products.

Ms Vasyli has been in custody since the body of her husband was found with numerous stab wounds in the couple's luxury home just west of Nassau, the Bahamas' capital.

Local police said the married father-of-two had been dead for seven hours before a worker found him.

Detectives originally took Ms Vasyli into custody following the discovery, saying she was a person of interest in the investigation.

She is now said to have hired the legal services of high profile local lawyers Elliot Lockhart QC and Murrio Ducille.

Bahamian newspaper The Tribune's website includes video footage showing a handcuffed Donna Vasyli apparently arriving at court flanked by security personnel. 

Police removed the 59-year-old's body from his house last Tuesday morning as his wife was questioned

Mr Vasyli established three podiatry clinics in Sydney and later founded an orthotic footwear company that sells products in the US, the UK and elsewhere. 

He set up his first practice in western Sydney and had lived in the Bahamas with his wife and two children for at least 15 years. 

In his 30-year career, Mr Vasyli has treated more than 50,000 people and established three Sydney practices, according to his website. He has since sold the businesses. 

The range includes over-the-counter orthotic footbeds, slippers, sandals and walking shoes. 

A friend left a heartfelt tribute to Mr Vasyli on his Facebook page.

'RIP Phil, It's comforting to know you are finding peace with the Angels [sic]. You will be missed,' she said. 

Another woman wrote: 'Devastated to hear of Phil's passing. I'm an old school friend. Praying for comfort for his family. RIP Phil.' 

Donna Vasyli is the mother of Mr Vasyli's two children, Aron and Lauren.

The podiatrist's not-for-profit organisation provides health support to third world countries and Ms Vasyli is a 'kind soul and bright spirit', according to its website.

She was a dental technician in Sydney before she met her husband.

The mother-of-two works for the Vasyli Foundation, alongside her children.
