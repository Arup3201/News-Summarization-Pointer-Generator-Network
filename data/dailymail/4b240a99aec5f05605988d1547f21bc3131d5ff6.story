Wonder drug: A new heart drug has shown to cut deaths by a fifth and reduce hospital admissions

Thousands of lives could be saved by a new drug for heart failure that researchers claim outperforms the current best treatments.

Clinical trials for the new drug – currently called LCZ696 – were halted early because of the ‘emphatic’ results delivered by the treatment.

Research on more than 8,000 patients found that it saved 20 per cent more lives than the current ‘gold standard’ treatment – the ACE inhibitor enalapril.

A co-leader of the trial, Professor John McMurray of the University of Glasgow, said: ‘We have what we believe is a much more effective replacement for one of the gold standard drugs for the treatment of heart failure. This is a major advance in the treatment of this terrible problem.’

Heart failure affects almost 900,000 Britons, most of them elderly, and claims 140,000 lives a year. It causes symptoms of fatigue, breathlessness, increased heart rate and swollen ankles, and can lead to serious complications.

It occurs when the heart cannot pump blood around the body effectively, possibly following a heart attack. The body responds to the low flow of blood by producing hormones such as angiotensin II and noradrenaline. But these hormones constrict blood vessels and actually make it harder for the failing heart to squeeze blood into them.

Over time, the constant production of these hormones further damages the heart, blood vessels and kidneys. Enalapril, the current treatment, works by blocking them, which slows or halts the progressive worsening of the condition.

Professor McMurray said LCZ696 has a similar impact but the twice-a-day tablet has additional benefits. ‘What this new drug does is simultaneously inhibit the bad hormones – like enalapril – but in addition boosts the production of beneficial hormones,’ he told a meeting of the European Society of Cardiology in Barcelona.

‘Several of these stimulate the kidneys to produce more urine – to excrete sodium and water – and act to relax blood vessels. All of these actions unload the failing heart. By having this dual effect LCZ696 had extra beneficial actions compared with enalapril and in this way improved patient outcomes.’

In the trial 8,400 patients with heart failure were given either 200mg of LCZ696 twice daily or 10mg of enalapril twice daily – in addition to recommended therapy – in a bid to compare mortality and hospitalisation rates.

Early results published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that 914 (21.8 per cent) of patients in the LCZ696 group died of cardiovascular causes, compared with 1,117 (26.5 per cent) in the enalapril group.

A further 711 (17 per cent) of patients receiving LCZ696 and 835 (19.8 per cent) of those receiving enalapril died of other causes.

This represented a 20 per cent reduction in death from cardiovascular causes and a 16 per cent reduction in death from any cause for those in the LCZ696 group.

Improvement? Sicentists claim it will prevent more deaths than the current heart treatment Enalapril does

The new compound also reduced hospitalisation for heart failure by a fifth, experts said. The ‘emphatic’ results prompted researchers to bring the trial to an early close after 27 months.

Another study leader, Professor Milton Packer of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Centre, described the findings as ‘highly statistically significant and clinically important’.

The drug’s manufacturer, Novartis, plans to apply for a licence early next year, meaning LCZ696 could be available in 2015.

Professor McMurray said: ‘Compared with our current gold-standard bedrock treatment enalapril, LCZ696 made patients live longer, stay out of hospital and feel better, fulfilling all our goals of treatment.

‘This is a remarkable finding.’

Nick Hartshorne-Evans, CEO of the heart failure charity The Pumping Marvellous Foundation, said: ‘Heart failure is a major and growing public health problem in the UK. Almost one million people in the UK live with the syndrome but awareness of it is low. We welcome the results of large-scale clinical trials, especially those that might advance the medical treatment of such an under-invested area.’
