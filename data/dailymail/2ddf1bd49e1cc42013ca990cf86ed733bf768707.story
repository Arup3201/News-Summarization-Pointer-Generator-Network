Georgia Salpa was voted as one of FHM's Sexiest Women In The World this year and we must admit, it's easy to see why.

The glamour model, who was also ranked the sexiest woman in Ireland in the annual list, has been unveiled as the face and body of Alexis Smith's first-ever swimwear range and is pictured lounging around by a swimming pool in the sizzling shoot.

The Greek-born Irish model last month replaced TOWIE star Jessica Wright as the face of the brand, which specialises in lingerie designs for petite women with D+ bra size.

Speaking about her first foray into swimwear, designer Alexis Smith said: 'It's so exciting to be launching our first swimwear collection, and Georgia looks stunning in the campaign. 

'The collection captures the bright fun time of year that summer is, whilst also offering a more sexy side for all those pool and beach parties.

'I have drawn inspiration from our bestselling lingerie styles - the pink candy stripe set and the leopard print set, which look equally as gorgeous as swimwear.'  

Georgia, 28, has the kind of body that most women could only dream of possessing but she sure works hard for it, often posting selfies at the gym or wearing skimpy sports kit.  

Georgia, who often uploads snaps of herself wearing skimpy gym wear to Instagram, shot to fame after a stint on Celebrity Big Brother where she was the third housemate evicted.

As well modelling Georgia has made other several TV appearances on shows such as Celebrity Salon and Catwalk to Kilimanjaro.

And sorry boys, but the London-based star is currently engaged to millionaire British hedge fund manager Joe Penna.

Enviable physique: Georgia showcases the body she works hard to achieve in the new swimwear campaign, which also includes glamorous kaftans perfect for pool parties
