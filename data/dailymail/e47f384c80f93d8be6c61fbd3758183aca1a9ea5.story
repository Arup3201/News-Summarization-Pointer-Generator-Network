Two primary schools are the  first in the country to teach pupils meditation techniques using Maltesers.

Youngsters are taught self- control skills in a simple exercise where they have to resist eating one of the sweets.

The training improves pupils’ performance by helping them concentrate, stay calm and cope with stress, teachers say.

What a Mal-teaser:  Bilal Khalid, ten, a student at Stanley Grove Primary Academy in Manchester is learning mindfulness and meditation techniques by seeing how long he can resist a Maltester

It is being introduced at three Manchester schools run by Bright Futures Educational Trust – Stanley Grove and Gorton Mount primaries, and Cedar Mount Academy, a high school.

The weekly lessons were originally introduced for teenager students at Altrincham Grammar School for Girls, which is also part of the trust.

But teachers believe that even younger pupils can benefit from the fun mental exercises, which include controlled breathing and a will power-based activity which challenges students to hold off from eating a tasty Malteser sweet.

The classes - known as 'mindfulness' training - was pioneered in America but has been running in a handful of UK secondary schools.

However the schools in Gorton, which started covering the exercises in September, are among the first British primary schools to introduce the scheme.

Resisting temptation: The training helps pupils such as Bilal and his friends Aicha Sadeg, nine, and Zarren Jemshaid, ten, by improving their ability to concentrate, stay calm and cope with stress

A psychologist linked to Manchester University is currently carrying out research into the impact of the hour-long lessons.

Amanda Bailey, from Bright Futures, said: 'It's not about the children sitting crossed legged at the table. There are a number of highly-structured practical activities.

'The same techniques have been used to treat adults with recurring episodes of depression to improve their capacity to cope. Organisations such as Google also offer mindfulness training to all their employees.

'The course for primary students is a version of the same thing.

'We are already starting to see some benefits in terms of the improved focus. Just as you might go to the gym and train your body, this is a way for pupils to train their minds.'

She added early lessons in how to bounce back from stressful situations, such as exams, could help students when older.
