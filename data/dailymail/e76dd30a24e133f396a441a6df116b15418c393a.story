French first lady Valerie Trierweiler should stop co-habiting and become a ‘legitimate wife’, her predecessor Carla Bruni said today.

Ms Trierweiler has become one of the most unpopular women in the country since moving into the Elysee Palace with her boyfriend, President Francois Hollande, in May.

One of the reasons the French dislike the 47-year-old so much is that they object to a live-in-lover being their Premiere Dame.

Ms Bruni, the 45-year-old former supermodel turned pop singer, famously became the third wife of President Nicolas Sarkozy following a whirlwind romance lasting just 80 days.

She made it clear at the time that her wild days as the lover of a host of celebrities including English rock stars Mick Jagger and Eric Clapton were over, and that she wanted to be a respectable first lady.

Now, almost six months since leaving the Elysee, Ms Bruni tells the new edition of French Elle magazine that Mr Hollande, who has never been married, should finally wed Ms Treirweiler, who has been divorced twice.

‘I think it is simpler to be the legitimate wife of the head of state rather than being his partner,’ said Ms Bruni.

She added: ‘Maybe I’m wrong and their choice is a modern one. But for my part I felt a real easing of the general worry about me when I married Nicolas.’

Just a year before her marriage to Mr Sarkozy, Ms Bruni had told Madame Figaro magazine that ‘monogamy bores me’, with many believing that she was solely going out with the president to boost her own profile.

Italian-born heiress Ms Bruni has been in the spotlight all her adult life, and is currently publicising her fourth album, which comes out in the spring.

The Paris home she shares with Mr Sarkozy was raided by anti-corruption police after Mr Sarkozy lost his presidential immunity from prosecution.

He is facing a string of serious criminal allegations, including claims that he accepted illegal cash from Liliane Bettencourt, the L’Oreal heiress and France’s richest woman.

In the interview with Elle, Ms Bruni suggested that Mr Sarkozy’s days as a high-profile conservative politician were probably over.

‘His return seems improbable, although I am no expert on movements in politics,’ said Ms Bruni, who was once a self-styled champagne Socialist, before transforming herself into a firm supporter of Mr Sarkozy’s right-wing policies.

Mr Sarkozy has denied any wrong-doing, while Ms Bruni has yet to comment on any of them.

Ms Trierweiler became particularly unpopular in June when she posted a tweet supporting a political rival of Segolene Royal, the ex-girlfriend of Mr Hollande and mother of his four children.

This infuriated both Mr Hollande and Ms Royal, and ensured that their three sons and daughter stopped speaking to Ms Trierweiler.

It later emerged that Ms Trierweiler had at one stage been the shared lover of both Mr Hollande and a married conservative minister. This was while Mr Trieweiler was also still married, and Mr Hollande was living with Ms Royal.

Ms Trierweiler is pursuing a civil action against Christophe Jakubyszyn and Alix Bouilhaguet, who exposed her alleged double-dating of Hollande and Patrick Devedjian. Both Ms Trierweiler and Mr Devedijian are suing for defamation and breach of privacy.
