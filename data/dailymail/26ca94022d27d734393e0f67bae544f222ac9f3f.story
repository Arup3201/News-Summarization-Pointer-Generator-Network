Former NFL superstar Chad Johnson left a $300 tip for a waitress at a restaurant in Montreal on Sunday and wanted the world to know about it. 

Leaving modesty aside, the footballer tweeted the check for his meal adding a reason for his generosity: 'Sundays are slow, this should help,' he wrote.

Giving himself a huge pat on the back, the footballer formerly known as Ochocinco attempted to dish out some wise words along with the cash, 'The tip is in the message not the money...' he posted to Twitter.

Tipped off: Former NFL superstar wide receiver Chad Johnson left a $300 tip for a waitress on Sunday

Wise words: According to Johnson, who still uses 'ochocinco' for his Twitter handle, 'The tip is in the message not the money …'

While he may be renowned for his skills on the field, it's when it comes to math where Johnson appears to be lacking. 

He racked up a bill for $351.92 and left a tip of another $300.92 making the bill total $652.84. 

Owning up: Many on Twitter laid into Johnson over his math skills after incorrectly adding up the total

However, perhaps distracted by his own good deed, Johnson incorrectly added the total up as $651.92. 

Bizarrely, he also wrote 'I LOVE YOU!!!' at the bottom of the check. 

His generous gift was well received on Twitter although a number were mocking him for his poor math skills.

It's believed Johnson is desperate to make a return to the NFL and is doing whatever he can to draw attention, however he appears to no longer in demand.  

He didn't have a bad season in the CFL for the Montreal Alouettes but there do not appear to be any options for him to move south of the border any time soon. 

Johnson was a six-time Pro Bowl selection in his 11-year NFL career, spent primarily with the Bengals.

His last NFL action came in 2011 as a member of the Patriots. He was invited to training camp with the Dolphins in 2012 but was released after he was arrested for domestic battery. 

Johnson reached a plea deal which allowed him to avoid jail time and was instead sentenced to probation.

During a court appearance for violating his probation in June 2013, Johnson reached a deal to avoid jail time but the judge rejected the deal after Johnson playfully smacked his attorney's behind. 

He was sentenced to 30 days in jail.
