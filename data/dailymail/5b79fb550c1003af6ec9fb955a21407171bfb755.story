This is the moment that glowing Vicky Clayton held new born daughter Elle-Mae in her arms hours after giving birth.

Tragically just six days later the seemingly healthy mother-of-two collapsed and died in an Asda car park.

She was celebrating her 33rd birthday as well as that of her son Bobby junior who turned one on the same day.

Distraught husband Bobby, 28, is now facing the daunting task of bringing up his two children alone.

Speaking for the first time at the family home in Hartlepool, Country Durham, he said: 'I still cannot believe what has happened.

'I don't want to believe what has happened. It doesn't seem real. How will I ever tell our children what happened to their mummy.'

Bobby revealed that Elle-Mae was born on May 9 after a short labour weighing 8lb 7oz at around 7am.

Healthy and well, mother and baby were out of hospital just a few hours later.

On Tuesday, Vicky was celebrating the double birthday and had gone on a shopping trip to Asda for a few items with her children and mother, Leanne.

Bobby had rang Vicky to check how she was getting on with their new arrival.

He said: 'She was fine on the phone and she told me the little one was having his porridge and the baby was asleep.

'She was planning on going to Asda to get some clothes for the kids that  afternoon.

'I said I'd see her later that night when I finished work and that was it.'

But Vicky began to feel ill as she walked around Asda with her sister and by the time she reached the check-out she was struggling to remember and had pains in her back.

As she got into the car park, Vicky suddenly collapsed.

Frantic staff ran to Vicky's aid and paramedics rushed to the scene and desperately tried to help Vicky as her horrified family looked on.

Asbestos supervisor Bobby said: 'I got a call at work after lunchtime from her sister Leanne telling me to get home straight away because Vicky had collapsed at Asda.

'I just assumed she'd fainted or something like that, and set off home. As I was driving, I kept ringing to see how things were, and Leanne was crying saying things weren't looking good and the paramedics were working on her.

'My dad then rang me to say go straight to North Tees as that's where they were going in the ambulance.

'I got there first, and then they brought her in. I was allowed to go and see her, and she had all of these tubes coming out of her.

'I couldn't believe it. The doctors told us all that they weren't going to give up on her, and that gave us all hope.'

As Vicky's condition deteriorated she was rushed to James Cook Hospital, in nearby Middlesbrough, where she was put on a life support machine - but medics were unable to save her.

Bobby said: 'After 20 minutes they gathered us in a room and said she'd gone.

'I was listening to what was being said, but didn't want to hear it. At first I felt like asking "gone where?" I knew what they meant, but I didn't want themto tell me she had died.

'I think it hit Leanne first, she started to cry. I just remember my legs buckling below me, and my dad had to catch me.'

Bobby says Vicky - who worked at plant hire firm Kramer in Sedgefield before leaving to have her first child - had no problems at all during her pregnancy,lived a healthy lifestyle and had not complained of any illness prior to her sudden death.

The day after Vicky died, Bobby had to keep a prearranged appointment to register Ellie-Mae's birth and he added the middle name Victoria as a tribute to his wife.

 The results of a postmortem examination are expected later today.

Bobby said: 'We don't know why this has happened. I wanted us to be together forever, and I can't believe we won't be.'

'The last few days have been a blur, but now I've got the children to look after and a funeral to arrange.

'I'll also have the job of telling the children about what happened to their mammy as they get older.'

Breaking down in tears, grief-stricken Bobby added: 'I'll have to tell Bobby that his mammy died on his birthday. How do you tell that to a kid?'

Bobby said he would like to thank friends and family who have left tributes at the scene and Asda staff for allowing them to use the site for tributes.

Vicky's funeral takes place at 1pm on Friday, May 25.

As well as Bobby and her two children, Vicky leaves parents Elizabeth and Les,brother Christopher and sister Leanne.
