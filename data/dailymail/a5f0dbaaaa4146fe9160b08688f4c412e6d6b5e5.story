Conservative MP John Whittingdale said the licence fee was ‘unsustainable’

The BBC licence fee is ‘worse than the poll tax’ and needs to be overhauled, the chair of the influential Commons Culture, Media and Sport committee has said.

Conservative MP John Whittingdale said the licence fee was ‘unsustainable’ and needed to be brought up to date with how people now watched TV.

He suggested that the licence fee could be added on to people’s council tax to make it cheaper for the poor.

Earlier this year, Culture Secretary Sajid Javid suggested the licence fee could be cut if the Tories win the election.

He said £145.50 a year is a ‘large amount’ of money and ‘needs to be looked at’.

Mr Javid also raised the prospect of a fundamental reform of the flat-rate licence fee to reflect the amount of TV watched on the internet.

Mr Whittingdale’s call for a fundamental change to the way the corporation is funded increases pressure on the Government to reform the licence fee.

He said: ‘I think in the long term it's unsustainable. 

‘I think most people, almost everybody, accepts that the licence fee as it currently stands need some tweaking to sort out anomalies.

‘People's viewing habits have changed and it needs to reflect that. That's a very simple change and I think people see that.

‘You then have the question of whether or not it should remain a flat poll tax, collected through some fairly draconian measures, and whether it should still be criminally enforceable.'

Mr Whittingdale added: ‘Government has already announced consultation on decriminalisation. I've been looking at other countries and I think there's quite an attractive option of linking it to a specific household tax - maybe council tax.

‘I think in the longer term we are potentially looking at reducing at least a proportion of the licence fee that is compulsory and offering choice.’

He added: ‘It's a question of introducing choice. I'm not saying I wouldn't pay the licence fee - I would go on paying the licence fee.

‘[But] It is a poll tax. It's actually worse than a poll tax because under the poll tax, if you were on a very low income you would get a considerable subsidy.

‘The BBC licence fee, there is no means-tested element whatsoever; it doesn't matter how poor you are, you pay £145.50 and go to prison if you don't pay it.’

He added the era when ‘everybody either watched or listened to the BBC’ was becoming ‘less true’, in the face of the catch-up services, online streaming, and more choice.

Mr Whittingdale said there was not a 'serious possibility of the licence fee going in the next charter renewal' adding: 'When I say it’s unsustainable I am talking about over 20-50 years.'
