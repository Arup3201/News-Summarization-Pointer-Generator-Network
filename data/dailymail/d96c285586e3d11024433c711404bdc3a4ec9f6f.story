Alastair Cook was left clinging to the England captaincy by his fingertips on Friday as a leading member of the emerging group beginning to blossom under him dragged his team back into a second Test they are doing their best to throw away.

It is not without irony that the latest failure of a captain who is now close to his tipping point should come on a second day at Lord’s when Gary Ballance demonstrated again there is considerable potential in England’s ‘new era’.

The big question is whether Cook will decide that promise would be better fulfilled without him at the helm - there is no chance of him being sacked - if India turn their position of superiority here into their first win in 16 overseas Tests.

The nightmare continues: Alastair Cook was dismissed for just 10

Cook is running out of chances to show
 that his attempt to prove he is the best man to move England forward is
 not undermining the batting that made him his country’s leading 
century-maker.

Cook’s swish 
of his bat, after he was trapped on his crease and offered MS Dhoni a 
catch with just 10 to his name, betrayed the  feelings of a man who has 
now gone 26 innings without adding the 26th hundred of his Test career.

Lord’s,
 with a green pitch made to order by England, should have been the 
perfect stage for the captain to get back on course by attacking India 
with the ball and then cashing in with the bat when conditions eased 
under the baking sun.

Yet the fact Cook managed neither leaves him with 
much to ponder even if a superb century from  Ballance, who has not 
enjoyed the best of weeks himself, at least delayed England being hoist 
by their own very green petard for a while yet.

That
 England are still waiting for their first Test win since the  halcyon 
days of last summer has little to do with the introduction of the 
cluster of newcomers who have largely taken to Test cricket like ducks 
to water.

Instead it is the 
‘spine’ of senior players, charged by England with providing the 
backbone and right example to the inexperienced group, who are mainly 
responsible for the failures that have left the captain on the brink.

Cook
 is the man under extreme pressure for his job but his life could have 
been made so much easier had Matt Prior, Ian Bell and, in this game at 
least, Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson made more of an impression for 
England.

Anderson at least 
ended up with four wickets in India’s 295, even though  he bowled poorly
 for much of Thursday, while Broad seems to be feeling the effects of 
his knee injury that will surely require  surgery sooner or later.

Prior
 appears to be on his last legs as a keeper, while another soft  
dismissal for Bell in England’s  miserable 219 for six on day two, still
 74 behind, showed he is struggling to accept responsibility as 
England’s senior middle-order man.

It
 will take a huge effort from Prior and the tail now to earn a lead 
after India, with four wickets for Bhuvneshwar Kumar (right), outbowled 
England, just as Sri Lanka did earlier this summer. Only India have now 
done it, embarrassingly for England’s attack, on an archetypal English 
pitch.

At least England 
could be thankful for Ballance’s third century in three  first-class 
appearances  at Lord’s and to a lesser extent for Moeen Ali, his partner
 in a stand of 98 that, for a while at least, promised a significant 
first-innings lead.

It was a
 display of character from Ballance, who was embarrassed on Wednesday by
 the emergence of pictures showing him topless  and the worse for wear 
in a Nottingham nightclub at the end of the first Test.

He
 could have sunk into his shell but snaffled two good catches on the 
first morning and then batted in a mature manner that  provided further 
evidence of his suitability to step into the big shoes left by Jonathan 
Trott.

It was a contentious 
call by Peter Moores to ask Ballance rather than Bell or Joe Root to bat
 at three this season, but with centuries here at Lord’s against both 
Sri Lanka and now India he seems assured of a long top-level career.

If
 only Ballance, missed by Dhoni on 32, could have survived to the close 
England would have been on top — but, frustratingly, he lost Moeen Ali 
to the part-time off-spin of Murali Vijay and then fell to the new ball 
himself, strangled down the leg side off the outstanding Kumar.

That
 leaves England, who have had much the better of the conditions, in 
another pickle that will seriously test the resolve of Cook.

There
 is no way Paul Downton, England’s managing director, and national 
selector James Whitaker will even consider replacing Cook until this 
series is lost, but their captain could fall on his own sword if things 
do not improve rapidly.

England
 do not have a history of sacking captains, with only Kevin Pietersen 
being pushed rather than jumping himself since Alec Stewart was harshly 
dismissed after the 1999 World Cup debacle.

Not least among the problems is a lack of viable alternatives to Cook.

There
 is no way Bell, the unofficial deputy, is an England captain while 
Prior will do well to hold on to his place beyond this series. Broad has
 injury concerns and far too much on his plate to be considered.

That
 just leaves Root. He is the long-term replacement for Cook but they did
 not expect to have to consider him when he is just 23 with only 18 
Tests under his belt.

Such is the mess England find themselves in, but without Ballance it would already be so much worse.
