A married American chemistry teacher with a young son was shot dead by gunmen in the Libyan city of Benghazi on Thursday.

Ronald Smith, 33, a teacher at the Benghazi International School, was killed while out for a routine morning jog.

No one has claimed responsibility for the shooting but his death comes days after an al Qaeda chief urged Libyans to attack American interests due to a U.S. special forces op which saw a terrorist suspect snatched off the streets of Tripoli.

Mr Smith, who is originally from Texas and has the words 'Libya's best friend' posted on his Twitter account, was a much loved teacher at the school. He had been with his wife for 16 years. 

The teacher was reportedly jogging in an area close to the U.S. Consulate, according to one security source. The U.S. ambassador to Libya Christopher
 Stevens and three other Americans were killed on September 11, 2012 
when Islamist militants assaulted the consulate in Benghazi.

Mr Smith tweeted this picture on November 15 of his wedding day with wife Anita with the message: '16 years with my besty'

He was shot in the central Al-Fwihet 
neighborhood of Benghazi then brought to Benghazi Medical Center where 
he was pronounced dead of gunshot wounds. 

Security official Ibrahim al-Sharaa told The Associated Press that the 
victim was jogging near the  U.S. Consulate at the time of the shooting although this report has not been confirmed.

'He was doing his morning exercise when gunmen just shot him. I don't 
know why. He was so sweet with everyone,' said Adel al Mansouri, 
director of International School Benghazi. 

The director added: ''He 
loved being in Benghazi and he loved Libya and the kindness of its 
people.'

Mr al Mansouri said that the teacher had been looking forward to going home for Christmas to see his family. 

Mr Smith was fondly remembered by students as a fun-loving teacher who was dedicated to helping them learn

Mr Smith was a dedicated teacher and had stayed on in Libya to see his students through their midterms while his family went to the U.S. for the holidays

Student Yomna Zentani, 18, told NBC: 'He was going back home to see his mom and his family where he hadnâ€™t been for some time.

In the latest government advice, dated June 7, 2013, U.S. citizens are strongly advised against all but essential travel to Tripoli - and all travel to Benghazi, Bani Walid and southern Libya.   

The State Department writes: 'The security situation in Libya remains unpredictable.

'Sporadic episodes of civil unrest have occurred throughout the country. U.S. citizens should avoid areas of demonstrations and exercise caution if in the vicinity of any large gatherings, protests, or demonstrations, as even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence.

'U.S. citizens traveling to, or remaining in, Libya should use caution and limit nonessential travel within the country, make their own contingency emergency plans, and maintain security awareness at all times.'

'He was supposed to leave this week but he said he would stay around for our midterms and sent his family. He was going to join them.'     

Mr Smith's students took to Twitter to post emotional tributes about their chemistry teacher with the tag #ThankYouSmith.

Sara tweeted: '#ThankYouSmith for being a great teacher and an amazing friend.'

@umyeahidek posted: '#ThankYouSmith for risking your life every single day to help reach our full potential in life. I am sorry you had to go this way.'

The teacher's death comes just days after al-Qaeda's American spokesman called for Libyans to 'stand up for revenge' on America after U.S. special forces snatched an al-Qaeda suspect from the streets of Tripoli.

Adam Gadahn, a former Osama bin Laden spokesman, says the kidnapping of Abu Anas al-Libi from Libya is a crime of piracy, urging Libyans to attack U.S. interests everywhere.

Gadahn
 released an audio speech to militant websites last Saturday saying that
 al-Libi had no role in the 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in 
Africa because he had left al-Qaeda and formed a new group.

U.S.
 special forces snatched al-Libi in October and detained him on a U.S. 
warship before bringing him to the U.S. to stand trial.

The American teacher worked at the Benghazi International School where students and teachers were grieving today for a much loved member of staff

'The
 kidnapping is a new episode in a series of U.S. crimes of piracy,' 
Gadahn said, urging Libyans to 'stand up for revenge' and attack U.S. 
foreign and domestic interests.

Similar
 calls were made by al Qaeda chiefs in the days running up to the 2012 attack on the U.S. Consulate which claimed the life
 of Ambassador Stevens.

Three other Americans - Sean Smith, Tyron Woods 
and Glen Doherty - also perished in the assault.

The State Department's deputy 
spokesperson Marie Harf said on Thursday: 'We can confirm that a U.S. 
citizen was shot and killed in Benghazi. We offer our condolences to the
 victimâ€™s loved ones.

'We are in contact with the family and are providing all appropriate consular assistance.

'Out
 of respect for the privacy of those affected, we have no further 
comment at this time. For questions on the investigation, I refer you to
 the Libyan authorities.'

Benghazi has become a flashpoint for violence in Libya with the city at the heart of the 2011 revolution against leader Muammar Gaddafi.

Libyan special forces have been battling
 militants from Ansar al-Sharia, the group that U.S. officials blame for attacking the U.S. consulate in the eastern city in September 
2012.

Security sources said three soldiers were also killed in separate attacks on Thursday in Benghazi.

Two years after a NATO-backed uprising ousted veteran leader Gaddafi, Libya's armed forces are struggling to contain militias, former fighters and Islamist militants who control parts of the vast oil-producing country.
