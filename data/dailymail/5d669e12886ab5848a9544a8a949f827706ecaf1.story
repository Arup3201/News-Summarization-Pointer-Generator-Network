Disease-causing bacteria can linger on surfaces in commercial airplane cabins for up to a week, researchers have found.

They say the seat-back pockets and armrests are particular hotspots for germs.

The team found E-Coli and MRSA bugs can survive for several days.

A major airline carrier supplied researchers with material from armrests, plastic tray tables, seat-pocket cloth, window shades and metal toilet buttons for the experiments.

In the study researchers simulated the temperature and humidity levels typically found during commercial flight.

MRSA survived the longest -168 hours -on material from the seat-back pocket, while E. coli O157:H7 lived for 96 hours on the material from the armrest.

Kiril Vaglenov, a graduate student in Auburn University's Department of Biological Sciences, conducted a two-year study -funded through the Federal Aviation Administrationâ€™s Airliner Cabin Environmental Research Center -to determine how long E. coli O157:H7 and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, would survive on commonly touched surfaces under typical airplane conditions.

A major airline carrier supplied researchers with material from armrests, plastic tray tables, seat-pocket cloth, window shades and metal toilet buttons.

'Our data show that both of these bacteria can survive for days on these surfaces, particularly the porous material such as armrests and seat-pockets,' said Vaglenov.

'Air travelers should be aware of the risk of catching or spreading a disease to other passengers and practice good personal hygiene.'

In order for bacteria to be transmitted from a cabin surface to a person, it must survive the environmental conditions in the airplane.

The study was presented this week at the annual meeting of the American Society for Microbiology.

In the study Vaglenov simulated the temperature and humidity levels typically found during commercial flight.

MRSA survived the longest -168 hours -on material from the seat-back pocket, while E. coli O157:H7 lived for 96 hours on the material from the armrest.

'The point of this study is not to be alarmist, but to point out to the airlines the importance of providing a sanitary environment for travelers,' said Professor Jim Barbaree, director of the study and mentor for Vaglenov.

Beware of the bugs: Researchers say seat-back pockets and armrests are particular hotspots for germs. They team found E-Coli and MRSA bugs can survive for several days in aircraft cabins.

'We want to work with them to minimize the risks to human health.'

The Auburn team is currently investigating how long pathogens that cause other diseases such as tuberculosis survive in an airplane environment.

Vaglenov said future steps include exploring effective disinfecting procedures and testing other surfaces and materials that have antimicrobial properties to determine if they can help reduce health risks.
