A pet refuge in Utah has said it wants to adopt Bela, the dog whose owner willed him to be put down after her death.

But Connie Lay's cousin, the executor of the estate, hasn't decided to spare the German shepherd's life, WXIX-TV reports. 

In the meantime, volunteers and workers at the PAWS Humane Center have fallen in love with Bela - but are powerless to save him if Lay's cousin decides he should die.

Cruel fate: Bela is due to be euthanized after his owner stipulated that he should be with her for eternity after her death last month

When Ms Lay died at her home in Aurora, Indiana, she stipulated in her will that Bela should be given to her cousin, who is the executor of her estate. If the cousin didn't want to take him, then he should be sent to the Best Friends Animal Society in southern Utah. 

Ms Lay's cousin has no interest in keeping Bela, Doug Denmure, the attorney in charge of the will, told the Cincinnati Enquirer. And Ms Lay neither contacted Best Friends refuge nor did she set aside money to send her pet to the shelter. 

So now Bela is in danger of falling victim to the final provision of Ms Lay's will - that he be euthanized and cremated and his ashes mixed with Ms Lay's. 

The Best Friends Animal Society issued a statement to WXIX on Tuesday saying: 'We want to save Bela's life and bring him to our sanctuary, but the decision to send him to us or have him put down and cremated is out of our hands. 

Bela is currently being boarded at the PAWS Humane Center while he awaits his fate. Several families have offered to adopt him

'The decision needs to be made by the person designated in Ms. Ley's will and we are hopeful that she will agree. Please be patient as we educate her about Best Friends life-saving mission and demonstrate that Bela will be in good hands.'

Ms Lay's cousin still hasn't decided to send Bela to the shelter. 

Hundreds of people have tweeted out with the hashtag #savebela since the story of his plight went public. Dozens of families have offered to adopt the pooch. 

However Mr Denmure, Ms Lay's lawyer, says only the executor of her estate has authority to decide his fate.  

'The dog was owned by my client and now it’s part of her estate,' Doug Denmure told WCPO-TV. 

'And those are her wishes, as far as the future of the dog is concerned. Outsiders don’t have the grounds to rewrite the provisions of my client’s will and impose what they want.'

Under Indiana law, pets and other animals are considered property. Owners must treat them humanely, but otherwise get allowed to decide whether they live or die. 

Lay died on November 25 - but before her death she made arrangements with her lawyer and a close friend to 'dispose' of all her property  - including Bela. 

Mr Denmure told WCPO that the dog is aggressive and that Ms Lay kept a record of his aggressive behavior before she died. 

When she passed away at her home, Bela fiercely guarded her body and would not let anyone enter the house. 

However, volunteers who have worked with Bela since he was taken to the shelter say that he hasn't shown signs of being overly aggressive, according to WXIX-TV.
