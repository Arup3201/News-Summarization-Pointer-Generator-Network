A teenage model was today jailed for seven years after being unmasked as an underworld gunman when police caught him keeping pictures of himself posing with a loaded pistol on his iPhone.

Marcel Maden, of Salford, Greater Manchester, took photos of himself playing with a Smith & Wesson revolver in the mirror - before storing them on his phone.

Police raided a house linked to the 19-year-old after a tip off last October and discovered an arsenal of weapons stored under the floorboards, including three handguns.

Officers also seized a 12-bore double-barrelled shotgun with two magazine clips, and a plastic bag of live 
ammunition ranging from 9mm casings to shotgun cartridges.

The incriminating photo was found when
police arrested Maden and seized his iPhone. Maden had claimed he had 
just bought the phone earlier in the year and had the memory wiped.

But officers examined it and found 
various pictures of Maden posing with the firearm whilst wearing a red 
face covering and standing in front of a mirror dressed in a distinctive
striped polo T-shirt.

Another photo showed him holding the 
gun with the barrel exposed. Police matched the incriminating photo to 
others of Maden dressed in the same polo shirt.

He also pleaded guilty to separate charges of being concerning in the supply of Class C drugs.

DC Gary Kelly of Greater Manchester 
Police said after the case: ‘When we examined the phone, we found images
of Maden wearing a polo shirt that had a unique pattern across the 
chest area.

‘When we examined further photos on Maden's phone, we discovered the same t-shirt was being worn on each occasion.

Dangerous weapon: This picture shows a knife with 19-year-old Marcel Maden's name engraved on the blade

‘That, alongside him having the same physical appearance and wearing the same watch as Maden as well as the photographer holding the same iPhone was enough evidence to put him behind bars.

‘Thankfully, these dangerous weapons have now been taken off our streets and I would ask anyone who may have information as to where guns and ammunition may be stored to contact us.

‘I would like to stress that the information you supply to us will be treated with the strictest of confidence.’
