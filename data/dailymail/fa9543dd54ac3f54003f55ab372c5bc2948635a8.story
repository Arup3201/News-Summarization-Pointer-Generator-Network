Harrowing family photographs have revealed how a Virginia father posed with his newborn son just weeks before he began the relentless abuse that led to the infant's death four months later.

Cory Daniel Walls, 24, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and felony child abuse Thursday after admitting there was enough evidence to prove he killed little Shane Daniel Walls.

Little Shane was born prematurely and spent much of his 120 day-life in hospital, initially because he was so underweight and then from injuries his father inflicted.

The photos show the baby in his mother's arms with Walls leaning over, hugging the woman. The child's mother - Walls' girlfriend - hasn't been named and her whereabouts are unknown.

Another image shows Walls asleep with the baby in his arms.

Walls faces 20 years in prison when he's sentenced later this year.

In testimony, he was described as a brutal caregiver, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch. The baby weighed just 14 pounds when he died.

An autopsy showed evidence of broken ribs and signs of cranial bleeding, both old and new, that stemmed from being vigorously shaken.

He told 911 responders and emergency room doctors that the child was having breathing problems, was crying and kept vomiting, but never mentioned his rough treatment of his son.

Either he or his girlfriend confessing to the abuse would have led to scans that would have revealed the child's brain damage, Deputy Commonwealth's Attorney Nancy Oglesby said in court Thursday.

In turn, little Shane's life may have been saved.

Oglesby also revealed Walls drained the family's resources to feed his habit for painkillers.

Shane Walls died last February 9, and Walls was arrested in May. A 21-word obituary for the baby listed no survivors.
