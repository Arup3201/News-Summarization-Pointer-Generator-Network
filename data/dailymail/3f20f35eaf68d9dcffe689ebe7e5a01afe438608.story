British Islamic State hostage John Cantlie twice tried to escape his terrorist captors and suffered 'weeks and weeks' of torture as a result, a freed ISIS prisoner has revealed.

Cantlie's punishment for trying to flee the Sunni extremists was so severe that the journalist almost drowned during one waterboarding session in northern Syria.

Both of Cantlie's attempts to escape ISIS were carried out with the American journalist James Foley, who became the first Westerner to be beheaded on camera by the terror group's British executioner-in-chief Mohammed Emwazi - also known as 'Jihadi John' - last August.

According to the former prisoner, during one of the escape attempts,  Foley, 40, had the chance to escape but refused to take the opportunity after his friend Cantlie, 43, was caught by the guards.

The details of Cantlie's punishment were revealed by Javier Espinosa, a Spanish journalist who was held by the radical Islamists between December 2013 and March last year.

Mr Espinosa, a correspondent for Spanish newspaper El Mundo, wrote in the Times: 'Foley and Cantlie tried twice. The first was a failure before it started. They were caught trying to get off their handcuffs with a skeleton key they made.

'On the second occasion, the American showed his true humanity. After getting out of the room where the prisoners were, he had to wait for Cantlie who was to escape second. 

'The guard saw that Cantlie (had freed himself) and Foley could have tried to escape on his own, but gave himself up. "I couldn't leave John on his own", Foley said.

'The attempts by Foley and Cantlie caused them weeks and weeks of punishment. Blow after blow. Attempted drownings. More blows. "They were literally trying to kill us for weeks until they realised that we had given up trying to escape", Cantlie had said.'

Cantlie, who has been held captive for over two years, has appeared in multiple propaganda videos for the extremist group, often dressed in an orange jumpsuit and sitting behind a desk. 

Foley was the first of several hostages to be beheaded in a video posted online by ISIS last August.

Three British teenage jihadists were in custody last night after a dramatic security operation stopped them joining Islamic State fighters in Syria.

A pair of 17-year-old schoolboys and a 19-year-old man were intercepted in Turkey after their parents realised they had fled to join the terrorist group.

They dialled 999 and British police quickly tipped off their Turkish counterparts. Officials swooped on the group within minutes of their flight touching down in Istanbul.

The three were brought back to Britain where they were questioned at a high-security London police station on suspicion of preparing acts of terrorism.

But last night they were released on bail. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'They have been bailed to return to a central London police station pending further inquiries.'

Investigators hope to discover how they planned to reach the war zone and why they decided to try to do so.

The case highlights the difficult balancing act the security services face in dealing with would-be jihadists desperate to sign up to the militant Islamist cause.

The details of the escape attempts follow hints by Cantlie that he suffered waterboarding - a torture technique associated with America's CIA - in a propaganda video released by ISIS.

In the fifth episode of a series titled Lend Me Your Ears, released in November, he said: 'Now, unless we tried something stupid like escaping or doing something we shouldn't, we were treated well by the Islamic State.

'Some of us who tried to escape were waterboarded by our captors, as Muslim prisoners are waterboarded by their American captors.'

Cantlie last appeared in a documentary-style production titled From Inside Halab, the ancient name for the Syrian city of Aleppo, reporting on a range of topics including education, drone strikes and Sharia law.

The hostage seems well in the film released last month, appearing dressed in black trousers and a brown coat, although he ominously described it as 'the last in this series'.

Mr Cantlie's father Paul, 80, died from complications following pneumonia last year. 

His sister, Jessica Cantlie, has previously appealed for 'direct contact' with the militants holding him.

ISIS has posted a number of videos of hostages being murdered, including British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning last year.
