An Australian held hostage in Iraq nine years ago says he came remarkably close to dying after Islamic extremists planned on beheading him before his 24-hour ransom was up.

Douglas Wood, who was 63 at the time, had been working as an engineer on a construction project in Iraq when he was captured by extremists in 2005.

His captors, who released footage of him pleading for his life surrounded by masked men, had demanded Australia and the United States remove troops from Iraq in exchange for Mr Wood's release.

Douglas Wood, who was 63 at the time, was rescued after six weeks by Iraqi and United States troops after being held captive by Islamic extremists in 2005

'Had I not been rescued, they had planned to cut my head off before the next 24 hours were up,' Mr Wood told ninemsn.

He was rescued after six weeks by Iraqi and United States troops in Baghdad as they carried out a routine raid at the compound where he was being held captive.

'There were five of us in there initially. The first time one of the others was killed, I heard three shots, and I thought, "Maybe I'm next, maybe I'm the one after",' he said.

Mr Wood's family had campaigned for his release by launching television advertisements in Arabic pleading with his captors to release him

'It turned out it was one guy. They did that on four different occasions. I rationalised that they were going to do the same to me.

'I hoped that I would be strong enough to not give them any pleasure out of it.'

His family had campaigned for his release by launching television advertisements in Arabic pleading with his captors to release him and setting up a website showing him as a loving family man.

Mr Wood said he wasn't aware of the planned execution until after he was rescued and his captors had been interrogated.

He arrived back in Australia at Melbourne International Airport in June 2005

The disturbing footage of an American journalist James Foley being beheaded this month brought back memories from Mr Wood's 'hell-hole' experience.

'I was very disappointed and upset. It was very sobering, at a minimum,' he said.
