A man has been reunited with his old wallet, and a host of memories, some 24 years after he lost it whilst water-skiing as a teenager.

Burton Maugans, 44, lost the wallet - which included his first driver's licence and ATM card - when he was a 19-year-old staying with his grandparents near Holden’s Beach in North Carolina.

Last week he was driving home from work in Hiram, Georgia, when he got a phone call out of the blue.

Class of 87: Inside the wallet was a host of cards belonging to Maugans including his high school ID from 1987

The voice on the other end of the phone 
asked for his name and said, ‘My name is Jim Parker and you don’t know 
me but I know your name, birthday, height, weight and address.’

Despite being slightly freaked out by the strange introduction, Maugans didn’t immediately put the phone down and decided to hear the man out.

‘I was at Holden’s Beach in North Carolina on vacation and I think I found your wallet,’ said Parker.

Maugans was initially thrown by the remark as he had his wallet in his pocket, but then he remembered back to years before - when he was 20 – and he lost a wallet.

‘My grandparents (and now my parents as 
well) live near Holden’s Beach and one summer we had gone to visit them 
for our annual vacation at the beach,’ explained Maugans, who first 
posted about the usual experience on Reddit.

‘I often water-skied in the Intracoastal Waterway and one fateful day I had ridden down with my wallet in my swim trunks and had forgotten to take it out before going skiing,’ he reminisced.

The soggy package was found by Jim Parker, 49, he was walking along Holden Beech with his wife when he noticed the dirty-looking velcro wallet washed up on the shore.

After giving it a good wash with fresh water, Parker noticed that there were several plastic ID cards inside.

He was shocked when the information on the cards revealed that they were from more than 20 years ago.

‘I had thought that maybe it might have been a week or two old, but no way did I think it would be 24 years old,' he told MailOnline.

Park, who lives 80 miles away from the beach in Lumberton, North Carolina, typed the mans’ name and home town into an internet search engine and quickly found contact details for Maugans.

After the pair spoke, Ryan posted the wallet and all its content back to their rightful owner.

When Maugans, who works as a councilor with people suffering from mental health and substance abuse issues, received the package he found the wallet and its contents to be remarkably well-preserved despite having spent more than two decades lost at sea.

A host of memories came flooding back as he looked again at photos of his teenage self on his first driver's license and ID’s for college and high school. An old ATM card and library card were also inside.

‘It was the one and only wallet I’ve ever lost in my entire life, and I assumed it was gone forever,’ recalls Maugans.
