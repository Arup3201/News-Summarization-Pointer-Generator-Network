Team news

Swansea 

Swansea boss Garry Monk might change a winning league line-up for the visit of West Brom on Saturday.

New £8million defender Federico Fernandez made his debut in the much-changed Capital One Cup side against Rotherham in midweek and stands by to replace Jordi Amat for his Premier League bow as Swansea seek to build on opening wins over Manchester United and Burnley.

Swansea are still without knee victims Marvin Emnes and Leon Britton, the veteran midfielder having suffered a further fitness blow this week when told he would need a scan in three weeks' time before he could get the all-clear to play again.

Provisional squad: Fabianski, Rangel, Fernandez, Williams, Taylor, Ki, Shelvey, Routledge, Dyer, Sigurdsson, Bony, Tremmel, Tiendalli, Amat, Montero, Gomis, Bartley, Richards, Carroll, Fulton, Sheehan, Kingsley.

West Brom 

Georgios Samaras must wait for his West Brom debut with the striker yet to regain match fitness.

The former Celtic forward will not play in the Baggies' Barclays Premier League outing with Swansea at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday and will instead go away with Greece over the international break, where Hawthorns head coach Alan Irvine hopes he will get some game time with his country. 

New man in: Former Celtic striker Georgios Samaras is yet to make his West Bromwich Albion debut

Fellow new signings Silvestre Varela and Joleon Lescott are also unavailable as they strive for fitness, while Sebastien Pocognoli is a doubt with hip and groin problems.

Provisional squad: Foster, Myhill, Wisdom, Baird, Davidson, Olsson, Yacob, McAuley, Dawson, Gamboa, Morrison, Brunt, Dorrans, Gardner, O'Neil, Mulumbu, Sessegnon, Ideye, Anichebe, Berahino.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Swansea have won four of their six previous Premier League clashes with the Baggies (L2).

Both Barclays Premier League fixtures between Swansea and West Brom last season were won by the team playing away from home.

Wilfried Bony has hit more shots on target (4) than any other Premier League player this season.

Bony has scored 12 Premier League goals this year, only Daniel Sturridge (13) has scored more.

Swansea have made fewer touches in the opposition box than any other team (17) this season, yet have taken maximum points from their two games.

Stealing the points: Youssouf Mulumbu (second left) scored five minutes from time to help West Brom come from a goal down to win 2-1 at Swansea in their previous Liberty Stadium meeting in March

WBA drew more games (15) than any other Premier League side in 2013-14 and have started the current season with two more.

West Brom remain the only team to score a penalty in the Premier League this season.

Swansea have scored three goals this season and Gylfi Sigurdsson has been involved in all three (one goal, two assists).

Nathan Dyer became only the third player to make 100 Premier League appearances for Swansea last weekend, and only Michu (24) has been involved in more goals than he has for the Swans in the PL (23 – 15 goals, 8 assists).

West Brom have failed to score in their last three Premier League away games (L2 D1).
