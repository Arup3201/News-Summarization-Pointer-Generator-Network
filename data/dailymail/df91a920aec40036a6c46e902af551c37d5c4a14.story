Garry Monk has called for the introduction of retrospective action to stop players diving after being ordered by the FA to explain his criticisms of ‘cheating’ Victor Moses and referee Michael Oliver last Sunday.

Monk has been given until Monday by the FA to explain the scathing comments he made following Swansea’s 2-1 defeat at Stoke.

But Swansea’s manager insisted he stood by his remarks, which included telling Moses he should be ‘ashamed’ of the manner in which he won a soft penalty – a decision by Oliver that Monk branded ‘disgraceful’.

'The penalty against is a disgrace. It's a disgraceful decision. 

'Not in a million years is it a penalty and the problem we'll have with it now is a lot of games we're having this season a match-changing decision is going against us constantly and I don't see anything being done about it.'

Monk, who says he would fine any member of the Swansea team who dives in a match or training, went on to claim that retrospective bans and financial penalties would be the only way to deal with simulation.

He added: ‘I've spoken to all our players. I'm not saying a Swansea player will never do it but the rules are there, the players know about it and they know how I feel.

‘I'd like to see retrospective punishment in these situations - a fine and a ban. It's something we need to consider.

‘I don't think the majority of football likes to see it. That's the only way I can see it would make players think twice about doing it.’

Referring to the FA’s call for his ‘observations in relation to post-match media comments’, Monk added: ‘I stand by comments. I spoke about how I felt at the time about Victor Moses and the situation. It was clear for me and I stand by my comments.’
