A nurse was allowed to force-feed her baby daughter to death under the noses of social workers who believed she was ‘concerned’ for her child.

Gloria Dwomoh, 31, faces jail after being found guilty yesterday of killing ten-month-old baby Diamond by pouring food into her lungs from a milk jug.

The disturbing case is the first of its kind in Britain and doctors nationwide are being warned about the dangers of force-feeding.

The Old Bailey heard how social workers, doctors and police missed a series of opportunities to save Diamond’s life.

The blunders included:

Guilty: Dwomoh was convicted of causing or allowing the death of her daughter

An independent review of the case 
also found officials did not realise the Ghanaian mother was obsessed 
with the weight and size of her children.

It said health workers were ‘inexperienced’ at dealing with force-feeding and under-estimated the danger to the new baby.

Baby Diamond died in a London hospital after fragments of food in her lungs triggered a bout of pneumonia in March last year.

Detectives
from Scotland Yard’s child abuse command were brought in when a 
post-mortem examination revealed she may have been force-fed for up to 
six months.

The pathologist who examined her body told police he had ‘never seen so much food’ in the lungs of a dead child before.

Dwomoh
admitted using the spout of a small china milk jug to hold baby 
Diamond’s tiny mouth open to tip in food as she weaned her.

She
fed her baby rice, African corn porridge and chicken soup up to three 
times a day at their home in Waltham Forest, East London.

The
nurse admitted that her baby often vomited after being fed, but said it
did not worry her because her other children had been the same.

She
insisted the feeding technique was ‘entirely perfect’ because she had 
seen it being used in Ghana, adding she also used a syringe to feed her 
baby milk.

She told the 
court: ‘I was scared – I come from a place where children don’t eat and 
they starve and they die, and I don’t want my child to starve and die.’

But experts are convinced Diamond must have been obviously distressed, choking and spluttering as the torture continued.

Dwomoh,
a committed Christian, travelled to Britain in 2000 to study fashion 
but switched to nursing before being granted indefinite leave to remain.

She
was suspended from her job at St Thomas’ Hospital, London, where her 
duties included feeding terminally ill patients, as police uncovered a 
history of abuse.

They 
found she had been confronted about force-feeding her other children, 
now aged between five and nine, as far back as 2006 and 2007.

She
blamed her senile 68-year-old mother, who cared for them for long 
periods in Ghana during their early years. But officials still failed to
act after doctors sparked a formal child-protection inquiry when she 
went to hospital to give birth to Diamond in 2009.

One
medic spotted that Dwomoh’s youngest daughter had a mouth injury that 
later required plastic surgery. Investigators concluded it was caused by
the rough rim of a plastic cup as she was force-fed.

Officials
found all three siblings suffered breathing difficulties, growth 
problems and were left so traumatised by force-feeding that they were 
scared to eat.

Police later realised the nurse had a dangerous obsession with food.

Neighbours
said she was always cooking and she was counselled by a psychologist in
an attempt to get to the bottom of her desire to constantly feed the 
children.

Just 24 hours
before her death, Diamond was examined by a GP who diagnosed her with 
ringworm but said she had no other injuries or symptoms of pneumonia.

Laura
Eades, of the Waltham Forest Safeguarding Children Board, admitted 
there were ‘weaknesses and shortcomings’ in the work of the authorities.

She insisted Diamond’s death was ‘not predictable’ but added that if proper procedures had been followed she may not have died.

As Judge Brian Barker QC remanded Dwomoh in custody after the three-week trial, he said it was a ‘very disturbing case’.

Dwomoh
was convicted of causing or allowing the death of a child, which 
carries a maximum jail sentence of 14 years. She will be sentenced next 
month.

Hospital worker was 'obsessed with daughter's weight' and poured food into her mouth

@highlight

Infant died from pneumonia caused from meat and cereal found in her lungs

@highlight

Knowing that all three of Dwomoh’s older children suffered similar abuse and serious health problems as a result of inhaling food;

@highlight

Failing to follow up a warning at least four years before the baby’s death that the shocking practice should stop;

@highlight

Being ‘insufficiently sensitive’ to the ‘significance of cultural values’ attached to eating in the family;

@highlight

A belief that Dwomoh’s actions were motivated by genuine concern for her baby; and

@highlight

Failure to intervene even after doctors realised one of her other children needed plastic surgery to repair a force-feeding injury.
