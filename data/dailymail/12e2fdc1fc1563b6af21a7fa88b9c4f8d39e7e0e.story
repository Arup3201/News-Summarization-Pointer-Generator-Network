With arms opened wide and a slight hint of a frown, the leader of this group of raccoons seems to be warning their saviours to keep back as they are rescued after an overnight stay in a dumpster.

But the raccoon behind him isn't quite so confident, putting its paws protectively around a smaller raccoon as it inspects the human who will get them out.

These adorable photos were taken in Albany, New York, after resident Danique Peynado went to take the rubbish out with her boyfriend.

'What took you so long?'  The trapped - and hungry - raccoons look less than welcoming as salvation arrives

As she opened the lid to throw the trash into the dumpster, she stopped when she saw four pairs of beseeching eyes looking up at her.

The raccoons had got themselves trapped overnight while foraging for food in the large green bin, but were not at all sure about the people who wanted to help them out.

Ms Peynado and her boyfriend Jeff made a ramp for the notoriously shy creatures out of cardboard and retreated to give the animals the confidence to come out.

The raccoons emerged blinking in the morning sunshine and then fled, probably to the next garbage bin.

Dumpsters are a popular source of food for raccoons, who tend not to think before they leap, and who are usually able to climb onto rubbish to get out once they have eaten enough.

But when the dumpster has recently been emptied, as this one had, there is nothing to climb onto - let alone eat - and the scavengers are stuck until a kind-hearted human comes and helps them out.

Raccoons are shy but clever - studies have shown they learn which night trash is put out in a neighbourhood
