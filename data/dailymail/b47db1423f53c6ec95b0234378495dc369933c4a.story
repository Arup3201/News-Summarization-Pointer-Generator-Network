Amy Robach has returned to the small screen after having a double mastectomy and said that she will begin chemotherapy treatment in less than two weeks.

'Physically I feel remarkably well. Mentally, that's another challenge because that was phase one,' the Good Morning America correspondent said during the show Thursday morning.

As MailOnline reported yesterday, ABC initially announced that Robach would be back on the morning news program this past Monday but much of the show earlier this week was dedicated to celebrating Sam Champion's sudden departure for The Weather Channel.

She's back: Amy Robach made her return to Good Morning America on Thursday and explained how she is scheduled to begin four months of chemotherapy on December 16

At the table: Robach said that she plans to work at ABC through her treatment, citing fellow breast cancer survivor Robin Roberts as her inspiration

Robach, who first discovered she had a malignant tumor in her right breast after an on-air mammogram, said that it was only after she had a double mastectomy three weeks ago that doctors realized there was a second tumor in the same breast and some abnormal cells in the left breast.

After the surgery it also became clear that the disease had spread to her sentinel lymph nodes, meaning that the mastectomy was far from the final step.

Staying positive: The 40-year-old mom said that her age and young children were the driving force behind her decision to pursue an aggressive treatment regime

'That was the devastating news for me. When I woke up, the first question I asked was "Did it spread to my lymph nodes?" because that’s the difference between chemo and no chemo,' she explained.

The 40-year-old, who opted for the most aggressive form of treatment because of her age and the fact that she has two young daughters and three stepsons, begins her four-month chemotherapy treatment on December 16.

'Anyone who has gone through this battle- as Robin has- knows, (surgery's) the first step but the next couple ones are going to be tough, and mentally I think is the toughest part of this,' she said referring to GMA anchor Robin Roberts' own battle with breast cancer.

'I'm going to work through it. I saw Robin do it. I know how strong you were and you give me strength, Robin, because it is important to get up and have something to do each day even if you don't feel great and even if you feel crappy and I know they have all these new drugs to make it a little less difficult.'

‘There are days where if you let your mind wander, it's fairly devastating.’

Ever since her diagnosis on October 30, Robach has said how she was hesitant to get the test done because she had no family history of the disease and there are certain medical authorities that suggest women first have the test when they are 50-years-old.

Today, Robach said that she had had the prescription to have a mammogram for a year before she actually went in for the exam.

'40 for me was the right time but 39 probably would have bneen better,' she said, adding that if she waited much longer 'that could have meant the difference between life and death for me.'

Her on-air discussion this morning coincides with the publication of this week's People magazine where her cancer battle is featured as the cover story.

'It’s going to be a crappy year, and then
 I'll be on drugs for probably the next 10 years and there are other 
issues down the road that we're discussing and we're dealing with. It's 
about being vigilant and taking care of myself,' she told People Magazine.

Staying positive: After an on-air mammogram revealed that she had a tumor in one of her breasts, further tests revealed that she had a second tumor, more abnormal cells and the cancer had spread to her lymph nodes

Due to the location and size of the tumors, Robach's surgeons were able to save her nipples and insert expanders that are placed where the removed breasts once were.

They will stay in place behind the chest muscle for a few months in an effort to stretch it out before implants are put in during a second surgery.

Even though she remains 'resolute' in her decision to choose the most aggressive form of treatment, it has been an emotionally taxing process.

'I'll be honest: there have been a couple of nights where I've sobbed myself to sleep,' she said.
