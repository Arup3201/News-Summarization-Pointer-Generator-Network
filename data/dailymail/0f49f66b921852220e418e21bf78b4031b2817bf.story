One out of three non-Latino Americans mistakenly believe that a majority of
Hispanics are undocumented immigrants, and according to a new poll, the media
is largely responsible for this misconception.

The Pew Hispanic Center released data which suggest that more than 30 per cent
of Americans are certain that more than half of all Latinos living in the U.S.
are here illegally, although the actual figure stands at around 18 per cent.

In addition, only 37 per cent of U.S. Hispanics are actually immigrants from
other countries.

Misconception: More than 30 per cent of non-Hispanic Americans believe that a majority of Latinos are in the U.S. illegally

One of two non-Latinos think 'welfare recipient' describes more than half of
all Latinos very or somewhat well, as well as 'less educated' and 'refuse to
learn English,' NBC Latino reported.

Results of a new poll released 
by the National Hispanic Media Coalition and
Latino Decisions point an accusing finger at the media, which feature 
negative portrayals of Latinos that help shape public opinion.

'The media is doing a disservice with coverage that is misleading the public
about Latinos who live in the U.S.,' said National Hispanic Media Coalition president
and CEO Alex Nogales.

'It is producing attitudes among non-Latinos that contribute to hate speech
and hate crimes. We must demand that the media do a better job with its
coverage.'

Latino Decisions conducted an online interactive experiment with over
3,000 non-Latino participants who were randomly shown either negative or
positive one-minute clips of Hispanics.

According to the study, being exposed to just one negative clip made it more
likely that the viewer would associate Hispanics with crime, families that are
too large and illegal immigration.

Bad rep: Seventy one per cent of those polled said they usually see Hispanics depicted as criminals or gang members

For example, 49 per cent of participants in the poll who heard a negative
radio clip thought Hispanics take jobs away from Americans, whereas 33 per cent
of those who heard a positive radio story shared that view.

After seeing a positive news clip, 68 per cent of respondents thought
Hispanics were ‘honest,’ compared to 53 per cent who saw a negative clip, and
61 per cent thought Hispanics were ‘neighborly and welcoming.’

Image problem: The study found less than half of non-Latinos describe Hispanics as patriotic, even after watching positive TV news coverage of the community

One of the most enduring misconceptions about Hispanic-Americans, however,
is their legal status in the U.S. Even after watching Latino actor Jimmy Smits
play a U.S. president on West Wing, 54 per cent of respondents still thought ‘illegal
immigrants’ applied to Latinos.

The study also found less than half (47 per cent) of non-Latinos describe
Hispanics as patriotic, even after watching positive TV news coverage of
Latinos.

And according to the study, what non-Hispanic Americans choose to watch and
listen to plays a major role in shaping their view of Latinos.

For example, 41 per cent of conservative radio talk show listeners
think Latinos take jobs away from other Americans, over twice the rate of
National Public Radio listeners.

As part of the study, 900 non-Hispanic participants were asked about their
views of Latinos and their portrayals in movies and on TV.

Seventy one per cent of respondents said they usually see Hispanics depicted
as criminals or gang members. In contrast, only five per cent of the participants
said they see Latinos cast in roles of doctors, lawyers or judges.

Stigma: Many Americans who are exposed to negative press coverage f Latinos associate them with families that are too large

However, there are also some positive trends that emerged from the survey.

Over 75 per cent of those polled think Latinos are family-oriented,
hard-working, religious and honest. Another positive bit of news is that young people are more likely to develop relationships
with Latinos, which may help break down the old stereotypes.

While only 12 per cent of 40-to-69-year-olds report strong interactions with
Hispanics, 55 per cent of 18-39-year-olds have close ties to Latinos.
