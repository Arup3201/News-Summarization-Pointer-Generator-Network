Manchester United have placed security guards at Angel di Maria’s house after an attempted break-in on Saturday night.

United’s Argentinean star was left shaken by an attempted robbery as he watched TV with his wife and young daughter in Cheshire.

Now United have given the record signing round the clock security from members of their own CES security group.

Sportsmail understands that a patrol from Control Event Solutions have been sent to Di Maria’s house for a week at least while security at the premises is beefed up.

The Manchester United star was the victim of a terrifying raid  when burglars are believed to have used scaffolding poles to smash their way in to his home.

Three thieves used the metal poles to break through patio doors as the Argentina winger reportedly ate dinner with wife Jorgelina Cardoso and one-year-old daughter Mia at his Cheshire mansion.

The break-in occurred at 7.30pm, just hours after the 26-year-old starred for United in their 3-1 win over Leicester City at Old Trafford in the Barclays Premier League.

Di Maria and his family were  whisked away by United's security team and later taken to a hotel by police, according to The Sun.

The former Real Madrid winger was shadowed by a security guard on Sunday as he drove from his hotel in his Range Rover, while images of his property showed a window boarded up. 

A source told the newspaper that none of the raiders entered the house because the alarm went off  and that when police turned up they were 'long gone'.

'From what I heard Di Maria and his family were very shaken up - as you would be,' the source added. 

Di Maria's agent confirmed the incident on Sunday and Cheshire police are investigating reports of a burglary.

'At 7.30pm on Saturday, January 31, police received reports of a burglary at a house in Prestbury,' a spokesman told Sportsmail.

'A number of offenders tried to gain access to the property by trying to smash the back door. 

'The alarm was raised before the men got inside and they fled the scene.'

Di Maria swapped the Bernabeu for Old Trafford in a £59.7million deal in August, and exclusively told Sportsmail in November he was loving life in Manchester.
