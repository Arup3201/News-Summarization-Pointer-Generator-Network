Brazilian authorities are investigating claims that organs have been illegally taken from unidentified bodies and sold for medical research.

The organs were allegedly removed from bodies which had not been reclaimed by family members at the Coroner's Service (SVO) in Sao Paulo.

They were then reportedly sold for research purposes, while the bodies were illegally buried as paupers in a cemetery in Perus.

Brazilian prosecutors are investigating claims that organs were illegally taken from unidentified bodies and sold for medical research. The bodies were then reportedly buried as paupers in a Perus Cemetery, Sao Paulo

This is despite no 'proper' efforts having been made to locate relatives and obtain their consent, prosecutors told the BBC.

Prosecutors launched an investigation last November after family members complained they had not been contacted before their loved ones were buried in Perus Cemetery.

They discovered 3,000 people possessing documents clearly identifying them could have been illegally buried in mass graves, marked only with numbers, as paupers over the past 15 years.

In these cases, the deceased had died in the street or a public hospital - and their bodies had not been reclaimed by relatives within 72 hours.

Shockingly, some of these bodies may have been buried with few - if any - organs, say prosecutors. 

The SVO, run by pathology teachers from one of Brazil's most prestigious universities, says it has since improved its procedures, but denies any illegal activity.

However, during their inquiry, prosecutors were told by two witnesses that organs had been illegally taken from unidentified bodies and sold for medical research.

They currently have no material proof to back up the allegations.

Dr Luiz Gernando Ferraz da Silva, the SVO's director, told BBC Brasil that the service operates 'within the law' and has no legal obligation to locate relatives of bodies taken to its premises.

He said the deceased are 'generally... buried intact', adding: 'There are specific situations in which organs are used, but always with the purpose of being used for research.

'But where patients' bodies are not claimed, that does not happen.'

Dr Ferraz da Silva said the service now collects detailed information about bodies - including photos of the deceased and their fingerprints and tissue fragments - before passing it on to the police.

In 2010, hundreds of thousands of Britons were caught up in an NHS blunder that saw organs being taken from dead patients and used without their consent.

Donors 
who expressly stated they did not want certain body parts taken after 
their death had their details changed so their records showed any of 
their organs could be removed.

More than 21 bereaved families were contacted by health officials to be told the disturbing news 
that tissue was mistakenly taken from their loved ones. 

The
 error, which affected 800,000 people, happened when details concerning 
the body parts that donors do not want to be removed was deleted from 
the NHS Organ Donor Register.
