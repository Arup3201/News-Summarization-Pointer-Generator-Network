More than 20 Anglo Saxon skeletons have been unearthed on a proposed building site in Suffolk - and archaeologists believe they could have connections to members of the royal family.

The remains were found in Exning, Suffolk alongside a host of jewellery, brooches, a glass bowl, weapons and beads, which experts believe points to them being wealthy and of high social status. 

The skeletons and objects date back to the time of King Anna of East Anglia at around 650AD.

More than 20 Anglo Saxon skeletons have been unearthed on a proposed building site in Suffolk (pictured) - and archaeologists believe they could belong to members of the East Anglian royal family

Initial searches had missed the location of the burial ground, despite one of the bodies found buried just one foot (0.3 metres) below the ground.

There was also a double burial, in which two bodies were found in the same grave, and what is known as a 'bed burial' involving an intricate wooden frame. 

A bed burial was typically reserved for women of high status during the 7th century and involved literally burying a person in the ground on a bed. As a result, they are extremely rare.  

The dig was carried out by Archaeological Solutions on behalf of Persimmon Homes, which is planning to build 120 homes on the site.   

Anna was the son of Prince Eni and nephew to King Redwald of East Anglia. 

During this time, King Penda of Mercia wanted to expand his borders into East Anglia, and in 635AD, pushed to take control of the Middle Anglia. 

During the battle, a number of members of Anna's family died, including his brother King Erica - who was also referred to as his cousin -  and Anna took the throne.

He was a Christian, and is said to have had five daughters including Saethrith, Sexburga, Etheldreda, Withburga and Ethelburga.  

Few records of his reign survive, so it is not known exactly how many children he had, or how he related to fellow members of royalty in the region. 

In 645AD, reports claim he was exiled to King Penda or Mercia, and during that time converted to Christianity. 

King Anna died during another Mercian invasion in 654AD and was buried at Blythburgh. 

Andrew Peachey, from Archaeological Solutions, said the finds date back to around 650AD and were 'totally unexpected'.

Mr Peachey, 34, said: 'One burial was very intricate with a wooden or iron frame possibly underneath the body.

'It may be what's known as a bed burial, but again it's too early to tell until everything is cleaned up properly.

'Another appears to be a warrior burial. A spearhead and dagger were found with the bones.'

Initial searches had missed the location of the burial ground, despite one of the bodies (pictured left) found buried just one foot (0.3 metres) below the ground. There was also a double burial, (pictured right) in which two bodies were found in the same grave, and a so-called 'bed burial' involving an intricate wooden frame

The remains were found alongside a host of jewellery, brooches, a glass bowl, weapons and a link and beads (pictured), which experts believe points to them being wealthy and of high social status

This glass bowl was discovered in the burial ground, and it is possibly from the Rhineland. Andrew Peachey, from Archaeological Solutions, said the finds date back to around 650AD and were 'totally unexpected'

'It is incredible that there was absolutely no disturbance caused to the graves, when you think ploughs must have just about been skimming across them.'

Although the burial site is believed to date back the 7th century, some of the items may be even older, including a dagger that could have been made as early as 7AD.

Most of the skeletons were found with so-called 'grave goods' including a glass bowl, brooches and other items of gold-plated and copper jewellery. The glass bowl is possibly from the Rhineland.

The team at Archaeological Solutions have now recovered the skeletons (pictured) and the items, and will be carrying out further tests to discover more about their identities. The 'excellent preservation' of both the skeletons and items meant the finds were of 'high analytical value'

A total of 20 graves were found, containing 21 skeletons (an example pictured) with so-called 'grave goods'

The quality of the items indicate the bodies may have had 'royal connections', and the area had close links with King Anna, who ruled East Anglia in the 7th Century. 

The region is also reported to be the birthplace of King Anna's daughter, Queen Etheldreda.

The items of jewellery will be analysed by the Portable Antiquities Scheme to determine their value and significance.
