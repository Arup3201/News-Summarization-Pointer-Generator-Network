Britain could pull out of the European Court of Human Rights because it has lost its legitimacy, Chris Grayling announced yesterday

Britain could pull out of the European Court of Human Rights because it has lost its legitimacy, Chris Grayling announced yesterday.

The Tory Party will publish draft legislation over the ‘next few months’ to rein in the influence of the Strasbourg court, the Justice Secretary revealed.

Mr Grayling admitted the Government will not act before the election because changes would be opposed by the Liberal Democrats.

But he said the Conservatives would go into the national poll with plans to ‘curtail’ the role of the court in the UK, ‘replace’ the Human Rights Act introduced by Labour and make the British Supreme Court supreme over UK law.

Mr Grayling said he had no argument with the European Convention on Human Rights, the body of principles that Britain helped draw up after the Second World War.

He praised its ‘sensible balance’ of rights and responsibilities.

But he said the Tories would act to stem the creeping tide of interference by the ECHR in the way they implement the convention.

He told Radio 4’s Today Programme: ‘Whatever we try to do as a party – because this is not an issue that unites the Coalition – the Conservative Party’s intention is to go into the next election with a clear plan for change.

‘It is absolutely clear Parliament has the sovereign right to implement that change should it choose to do so. We have been looking at a number of options, of which leaving the Convention is one.

‘It’s not the only option we are considering and we will bring forward plans in the next few weeks which will set out very clearly what we will do and how we will do it.

‘Later in the year we will publish a draft bill which will set out precisely how that legal change will take place.’

Mr Grayling spoke out after former Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge warned that the European Court of Human Rights is undermining Parliament’s sovereignty.

The Justice Secretary said: ‘We have to curtail the role of the court in the UK, we have to replace the Human Rights Act, which as Lord Judge rightly says is one of the key reasons why the European Court of Human Rights seems to have such sway in the UK.

'We have got to ensure there is a balance of rights and responsibilities in our laws – and that balance of rights and responsibilities does exist in the original convention.

‘And above all, we have to make our Supreme Court supreme. I do not believe decisions about the way this country is governed – we are a democracy after all – should be taken elsewhere.’

Mr Grayling spoke out as one of the country’s leading retail bosses said the European Union had become ‘hungry for power’. Lord Wolfson, a Conservative peer, said that the EU needed to change in the ‘direction of free trade rather than a government of governments’.

‘The question about whether we stay in or out depends on whether it changes enough,’ the Next boss told the Today programme.
