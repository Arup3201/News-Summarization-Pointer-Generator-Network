The ObamaCare website is 'easy' to hack, critics say, and has become the focus of security concerns as the second year of enrolment approaches. 

The healthcare site is one of the largest federal collections of personal information ever assembled in the U.S., containing the first and last names, home address, social security number and payment information - including credit card data - of people who enrol.

 

President Barack Obama's ObamaCare website is 'easy' to hack, say critics who are drawing attention to data security concerns as the second year of enrolment approaches

The website was hacked on July 8, but the security breach wasn't spotted until August 25

Lamar Smith, chair of a congressional committee looking after the security of the website, said there had been hearings on the 'lack of security' around the website.

He told Fox News: 'What we've discovered is that it seems to be easy to be hacked, the security is not secure.' 

For example, the website was hacked on July 8 but the security breach wasn't discovered until August 25.  

Last month, a Government Accountability Office report said, 'Until these weaknesses are fully addressed, increased and unnecessary risks remain.'

But officials say they have met 19 of 22 GAO recommendations.

One security specialist, David Kennedy, warned that hacking cases had risen 400 per cent this year, saying 'it's a mess out there right now'.  

Congressman Smith had concerns last fall, but the former chief technology officer to the president, Todd Park, testified last November that he knew nothing about security problems.

Mr Smith contends that problems were known but ignored, and is issuing a subpoena to force Mr Park to testify again. 

There is no law that requires the federal government to notify anyone that their personal information has been hacked.   

About 20 million Americans have gained medical insurance under the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as ObamaCare, since it was signed into law in 2010.

The law was designed to make health insurance simpler and more available to Americans, but critics have lambasted it as a waste of money.
