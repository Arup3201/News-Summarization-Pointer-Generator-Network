Sugar sickness: Cara Dillon had all the signs of diabetes, but thought she was just 'stressed'

The symptoms pointed to a text-book case of diabetes: unexplained sudden weight loss,  an unquenchable thirst, a craving for sugary food, and a life-sapping exhaustion that left Cara Dillon too tired to lift her baby twin boys.

Yet the Irish folk singer simply put the gradually growing list of problems down to ‘tour stress’.

Cara was 31 at the time, in 2007, and had been a healthy size eight her whole adult life, always about eight stone.

But, a year before, she had given birth prematurely to twins Noah and Colm, going into labour while performing on stage in Swindon – and felt she had never ‘bounced back’.

She explains: ‘We were on tour in Northern Ireland – I’m from Derry – and I was exhausted.

I was eating the same as usual but then got a craving for chocolate muffins and doughnuts.

And I was constantly thirsty.

‘My clothes were hanging off me. When I weighed myself, I was under six stone.

'The crunch came when we got back home to Somerset

'I crossed the room to lift one of the boys out of his cot and I couldn’t pick him up. I was so weak.

'My husband, Sam, put his foot down. It was time I went to the doctor.’

Cara was immediately referred  to the Bath hospital where the twins were born. Later that day she was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.

Cara says: ‘I felt my body had let me down. For three days, I was cast into a deep depression, almost as though I was in mourning. I thought I’d have to give up my career. How could I tour? How could I look after the boys properly?

'And I certainly wasn’t going to be injecting myself three or four times a day. It’s impossible to prove this, but one consultant said my immune system had taken a bit of a battering following my emergency caesarean. So that could have acted as a trigger for my autoimmune system to stop functioning properly.’

There are 3.2 million diabetics in the UK, ten per cent with type 1.

Diabetes affects the body’s ability to process glucose, the molecule most carbohydrates are broken down into by digestion before passing into the bloodstream. The hormone insulin is produced to help this sugar enter cells, where it is used for energy.

Dietician Douglas Twenefour, clinical adviser for Diabetes UK, explains: ‘People develop type 1 diabetes because the immune system attacks the cells that naturally produce insulin. We still don’t understand why. Typically, this form of diabetes occurs in people under 40, quite often in children once they reach double figures.’

In type 2 diabetes, usually linked to obesity, the gland that produces insulin – the pancreas – stops working. Although it is not fully understood, some studies suggest that a virus or other environmental stress might trigger this.

New lease: Cara, pictured holding Noah with Sam and Colm at the piano, dropped two stone and was too tired to pick up her own children before she was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes

The acute symptoms that Cara experienced – frequent urination, increased thirst, blurred vision and extreme tiredness – are a result of sugar building up to damaging levels in the blood, affecting the function of all organs.

Last year Home Secretary Theresa May revealed she had been diagnosed with type 1 aged 56 – ending speculation about her dramatic weight loss. Singer Susan Boyle has also been affected as an adult.

Once, type 1 diabetes was fatal but regular injections of synthetic insulin mean it is now easy to manage.

Cara says: ‘On the fourth morning my depression gave way to determination. I wasn’t going to let this thing beat me. I wasn’t going to die of diabetes; I was going to live with it.

‘We were due to tour Europe and America. So I asked the consultant how to cope with the time zones. Normally, she said, she’d recommend a week-long course to teach me how to count my carbohydrate intake.

Helping hand: It was Cara's husband Sam who made her go to the doctor in 2007

'But she arranged a half-day crash course. Then I bought scales to weigh the food and work out the carbs. I became pretty obsessive, eliminating everything with added sugar. But I realised this was the diabetes controlling me.

‘So I worked out how much insulin I’d need depending on what I planned to eat and then had whatever I wanted, which might include a couple of glasses of wine.’

Cara injects herself ten minutes before a meal and once each evening at 10pm to last through the night.

‘I never thought I’d be able to do it but it’s amazing what you get used to,’ she says. If she’s doing a gig, though, she has to adjust her insulin levels. Performing increases adrenaline which raises blood sugar levels. ‘I have to compensate with an injection before I need it to take account of the adrenaline rush that will kick in as soon as I start singing. Get it wrong and it starts making my voice go wobbly.’

In October 2010, her daughter Elizabeth was born. ‘I had to have very tight blood glucose control throughout the pregnancy because your sugar levels are so random as your hormones are all over the place. I have a small device to test the level.

‘Your blood sugar level should be around five. Being pregnant made  it shoot up, which is why I needed regular insulin. But if it falls too low, you risk a hypoglycaemic attack and blacking out. I had to have a blood test every six weeks.’

At 38 weeks, Elizabeth was delivered by caesarean weighing a healthy 7lb 14oz.

Although type 1 diabetes is not  an inherited disease, a first-degree relative is six times more likely to develop it. Cara’s children are currently all well, but she adds: ‘I had a cousin who died of the condition.’

‘This will sound odd,’ she says,  ‘but I honestly think diabetes has made me a better person. I’m certainly much more disciplined.’

And the career that was nearly killed off by her debilitating illness? With a new album just recorded and a tour of China around the corner, it’s looking better than ever.
