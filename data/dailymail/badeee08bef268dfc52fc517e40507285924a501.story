John Yates, 59, pictured outside court today, met Ukrainian Marina Ivleva, 49, online but their marriage  ended acrimoniously

An internet bride who made her fortune in the UK after marrying a British man she met online is now fighting her in the divorce courts for a 'fair share' of her wealth.

Ukrainian Marina Ivleva, 49, left Crimea for Leicester in 1999 after meeting John Yates through an international dating site and went on to earn more than he did.

She had left for Britain for love and a better financial future because the average annual wage can be as low as £2,000-a-year at home.

In her 12-years in the UK she has risen to a senior administrator at De Montfort University and amassed assets and cash.

Now her truck-driving husband, who lives in a council house after they split two years ago, is taking her to court because he claims he deserves the 'fair share' of her wealth.

Mrs Ivleva is living in their home in Leicester with her grown up son from a previous marriage, Robert, 26.

Mr Yates says he is languishing with 'nothing' in council accommodation and insists he is due a 'fair share' of her money.

The Court of Appeal heard that Mrs Ivleva told Mr Yates that she had divorced him in Ukraine, and this has sparked a bitter legal battle.

She then tried to get her foreign divorce recognised in England in March but High Court judge Mr Justice Peter Jackson refused. 

He said that Mrs Ivleva had 'trailed her coat' by keeping her husband in the dark about details of the Ukrainian proceedings until it was too late for him to do anything about them.

Describing their relationship as a 'limping marriage', he said 'basic fairness' to Mr Yates demanded that he be given the opportunity to divorce his wife in England.

In his 'emphatic' ruling, the judge said that, although the divorce had been advertised in a Ukrainian newspaper, Mr Yates spoke very little of his wife's native language.

In the latest legal skirmish Mrs Ivleva's son spoke on her behalf as she challenged the judge's decision at the Court of Appeal.

She claimed to have suffered discrimination as a foreign wife and that the ruling amounted to an 'attack on the integrity' of the Ukrainian courts.

However, sitting judge Lady Justice King sided with Mr Yates and described the judge's refusal to recognise her Ukrainian divorce as 'exemplary' and 'unimpeachable'.

The ruling opened the way for Mr Yates to pursue his county court divorce petition and seek financial orders against his wife.

He said outside court after the ruling: 'She's got everything. I've got nothing and I'm entitled to a fair share.

'I'm living in council accommodation from day-to-day. She can afford to go on holiday. I can't'.

He added that he expected his decree nisi to go through on January 5, finally ending his marriage.
