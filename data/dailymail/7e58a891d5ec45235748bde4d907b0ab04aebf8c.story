With only a month to go before sport's global spotlight rests on London, organisers of the Olympic Games began the countdown in spectacular fashion.

Giant Olympic rings suspended from Tower Bridge have been unveiled, making a striking statement on one of the capital's most iconic landmarks.

London 2012 chairman Lord Coe and mayor Boris Johnson were among the VIPs who watched as the rings - 25 metres wide and 11.5 metres tall - were lowered into place on the central London bridge on the River Thames.

The rings, which weigh three tonnes, cost £259,817 to produce and installing them is estimated to have cost £53,000.
