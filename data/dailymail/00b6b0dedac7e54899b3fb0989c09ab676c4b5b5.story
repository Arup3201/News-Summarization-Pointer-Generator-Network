David Cameron has accused the First Minister of ‘desperate’ tactics over his claim that separation will protect the NHS from privatisation.

The Prime Minister stressed health is devolved to Holyrood and controversial changes at Westminster cannot be imposed on Scots.

Alex Salmond, who went green bowling in Arbroath with Scotland's Commonwealth medallists today, has argued that NHS budget cuts south of the border would be replicated in Scotland – despite the fact Holyrood has received an extra £1.3billion from Westminster over five years.

He has persisted with the argument despite claims of hypocrisy after it emerged the Scottish Government’s own spending on private contractors rose by almost a quarter last year to more than £80million.

Mr Cameron said: ‘Health is a devolved issue. So the only person who could, if they wanted to, introduce more private provision into the NHS in Scotland is Alex Salmond.

‘I think this is a desperate man recognising the argument is going away from him making a pretty desperate argument.

‘Actually because of the protection on NHS spending that the UK Government has given that we would not cut NHS spending while we have had to make difficult decisions elsewhere - that has actually made sure under the Barnett formula that money is available for Scotland as well.

‘So I think that argument does not stack up at all.’

Mr Salmond has even claimed he would legally protect Scotland’s NHS from privatisation in the constitution in an attempt to woo left wing voters.

And the pro-independence Yes Scotland campaign say the message is winning over voters on the doorsteps.

Campaigning in Glasgow yesterday, chief executive Blair Jenkins said: ‘There are real threats and risks if we stay in the UK.

‘People in Scotland are really waking up to the extent to which the NHS in England is being privatised, that’s coming up a lot.

‘People know if we stay in the UK the austerity agenda, the pressure on public services, budget cuts, and all of that will continue.

‘There’s no doubt this is touching a real emotional nerve with people, particularly women. They can see there is a really strong argument on that front for voting for independence.’

Scottish spending on private sector healthcare rose by 37 per cent in the first five years after the SNP came to power in 2007.

In 2012/13, the most recent Audit Scotland figures available, private spending had reached more than £80million – that was 23 per cent higher than the previous year alone.

Unaudited figures for 2013/14 show a slight dip to £79million, but is still far higher than all previous years.

Mr Salmond has argued privatisation south of the border will lead to a cut. In fact, the budget for England’s NHS is expected to increase from £105.6billion in 2013-14, to £110.4billion in 2015-16.
