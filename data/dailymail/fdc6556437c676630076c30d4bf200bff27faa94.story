One-way trip: A PhD student from Manchester is one of 1,000 people shortlisted for the trip to Mars

Danielle Potter’s lifetime ambition is out of this world... on Mars, in fact.

The 29-year-old PhD student has been shortlisted for the Mars One project to create a settlement on the Red Planet.

Among the many drawbacks is the fact that, if she’s picked, she can’t come back.

Miss Potter, who is completing a PhD in cancer therapies, is one of 1,058 hopefuls whittled down from more than 200,000 global applicants for the eight-month, one-way trip in 2025.

The Dutch organisers will now pick 24 from the shortlist to be trained as astronauts for ten years.

The former hairdresser, of Moss Side, Manchester, said she would miss her family, friends – and Coronation Street.;

She added: ‘I would be doing something that no-one man or woman has ever done before.

‘It’s very daunting, but it is still a long way off and I would only go if I was 100 per cent confident that it would be feasible to get there. It would be an enormous challenge, both physically and mentally.

‘I know it would be a one way mission. I would miss my family and friends and they would miss me, but we would still be able to Skype. I love Manchester and I would miss the city too, but hopefully I would get Coronation Street up there to remind me of home.’

The Mars One project was set up in 2011 by two
 Dutchmen and aims to establish a human settlement on the Red Planet.

Miss Potter, who has a sister and twin brother, is completing her PhD at 
the Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute based at the University of Manchester after studying an undergraduate 
degree in molecular biology.

Colony: The mission will aim to set up a permanent manned outpost on the Red Planet which could later expand

She added: ‘It’s so exciting to be part of his project and to be shortlisted 
for what would be a truly historic event.

‘My family have mixed views about it and my friends have said they would get a petition to stop me from going.

‘My boyfriend isn’t too keen either, but 
[we] already have a long-distance relationship and I’m hoping I would sneak 
him on board as an engineer.’

‘It would be a bit like living in Antarctica. My family would be able to speak to me on the TV screen, but they would not be able to come to see me. It’s not like I would lose contact with them.

‘If I’m successful in getting into the 
next round, I’d get to train with some of the best of the best in the 
space industry and get a lot of experience with training in the Arctic 
circle.

More than 1,000 people including 36 Britons have been shortlisted, including Dr Keith Evans, a 27-year-old post doctoral research fellow at the University of Warwick. The shortlist will be whittled down to just 24

‘With my scientific research background I’d be trained to look for possible extraterrestrial life on the planet.

‘What
 has always driven me with my research is that hunt to find something 
new. When I learnt about this opportunity I thought it would be great to
 be a part of the most historic thing to ever happen in our galaxy.

‘I
 never thought going to space would be within my grasp but it would be 
great to do research there and look at something no one has ever seen 
before.’
