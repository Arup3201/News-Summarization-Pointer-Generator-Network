Gone: Accomplished sci-fi and fantasy writer Richard Matheson died on June 23 at the age of 87

Famed sci-fi and fantasy writer Richard Matheson has died at the age of 87. Matheson was best known for his stories 'I Am Legend' and 'The Shrinking Man.'

Matheson's daughter Ali announced his death on Sunday, saying he died 'surrounded by the people and things he loved.'

Matheson passed away on June 23.

Matheson was a prolific writer, and many of his works and were turned into films.

'I Am Legend' the story about the last man alive after an apocalypse, spawned three film adaptations - 1964's 'The Last Man on Earth' starring Vincent Price, 1971's 'Omega Man' starring Charlton Heston and the most recent 2007 version 'I Am Legend' starring Will Smith.

Other stories turned into films include 1953's 'Hell House,' 1956's 'The Shrinking Man,' 1958's 'A Stir of Echoes,' and 1978's 'What Dreams May Come.'

He also penned a few episodes of 'The Twilight Zone' including a popular episode called 'The Nightmare at 20,000 Feet' which starred William Shatner

Matheson also helped inspire a new generation of storytellers. Anne Rice said his short story 'A Dress of white Silk' was part of what got her interested in vampires.

When writing Cell, Stephen King drew heavily upon Matheson's work and Steven Spielberg's first film was based on a Matheson story.

The thing that set Matheson apart from other writers in his genre was that he kept his stories grounded in a recognizable world.

In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Matheson said: 'I wrote about real people and real circumstances and real neighborhoods. There was no crypts or castles or H.P. Lovecraft-type environments. They were just about normal people who had something bizarre happening to them in the neighborhood. I could never write about strange kingdoms. I could never do Harry Potter or anything like that. Even when I did science-fiction I didn’t write about foreign planets and distant futures. I certainly never did fantasies about trolls living under bridges. I had to write about realistic circumstances. That’s the way my brain works. And I think that gave me a sort of place in the field.'

Legendary: One of Matheson's stories 'I Am Legend' was turned into a film three times, most recently starring Will Smith

Honorable: Matheson was scheduled to receive a visionary award at the Academy of Science Fiction, Horror and Fantasy Film's Saturn Awards this Wednesday

Tragically, Matheson was going to receive a visionary award this Wednesday at the Academy of Science Fiction, Horror and Fantasy Films' Saturn Awards. Their 39th annual ceremony will be dedicated to Matheson, and his award presented posthumously.

'We are heartbroken to lose a writer of towering talent, unlimited imagination and unparalleled inspiration,' Robert Holguin, the academy's president told the AP. 'Richard was a genius whose visions helped bring legitimacy and critical acclaim to science fiction and fantasy.'

Matheson was born in 1926 in New Jersey and raised in Brooklyn, New York. He published his first short story in 1950 and moved to Los Angeles in 1951. The following year he married his wife Ruth Ann Woodson and together they had four children, three of which became writers themselves.

Matheson is survived by his wife and children.
