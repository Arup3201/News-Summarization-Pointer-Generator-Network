This is the heart-stopping moment a woman almost died when a car left the road and ploughed into a tanning salon – and she only escaped because of her ‘lightning’ reactions.

CCTV images show the woman walking down a pavement in Hathershaw, Greater Manchester, wearing a dark coat and carrying a bag at her side.

She reaches the crossing just moments before a car hurtles in her direction from the main road and crashes into the side of Tanning Salon 365, which was closed at the time.

Her quick reactions meant she spotted the car and had milliseconds to turn and flee as it headed straight for her.

The car was slowed by the impact after hitting a pelican crossing post, allowing the woman enough time to escape.

The frightening scenes were captured on CCTV at around 8.15pm last Wednesday – when the woman appeared to escape without injury.

Footage also showed that moments before the crash a couple with a child passed the very same spot.

Kate Mellor, from Keep Active Mobility - a shop linked to where the CCTV was filmed, said: ‘I was absolutely shocked, we had seen the lamppost and things, I just can't get over that poor woman.

‘I've heard the sound on the CCTV and there's no sound of screeching of tyres or anything to warn her. I walk my dog around there and if it had been me it would have had me over.

Seconds before a couple can be seen walking past the same spot with their child and speaking to the woman

‘Just before there was a couple walking up with a little girl, they do actually talk to the lady for a matter of seconds before she walks down to where the car hit - it could have been those seconds that saved her life.’

A Greater Manchester Police spokesperson confirmed that they had responded to a two vehicle crash involving a blue Audi and a black Mercedes on Aston Road in Hathershaw shortly after 8.15pm on August 13.

The road was closed for some time after the accident and three people in the cars reported minor injuries.
