These CCTV images show the shocking moment a soldier sped through the streets of a busy city centre after a drinking binge.

Corey Eastwood had drunk 15 bottles of beer before the crazed rampage in which terrified pedestrians dived out of the vehicle's path.

Driving uncontrollably through the centre of Hull, he smashed into two men as he mounted the pavement.

He pinned another man against the wall of a pub after driving straight into it.

Lucky escape: Drunk driver Corey Eastwood can be seen reversing his car down a main street in Hull on October 27, before crashing into a pub, bottom right.

Paused for thought: Security guards and members of the public approach Eastwood's vehicle. The former soldier had drunk 15 bottles of beer

To the rescue: More members of the public begin to approach the vehicle as Eastwood sits inside

His terrifying rampage behind the wheel was only stopped when one of the victims, whose foot had been broken in the ordeal, ran after the car and pulled the keys out.

Eastwood, who has now been discharged from the army, was only sentenced to a suspended jail sentence when he appeared at Hull Crown Court on Friday.

Weeping as he stood in the dock, Eastwood was told how it was simply 'luck' that nobody had been more seriously injured.

Recorder Graeme Cook told him: 'You had a lot to drink and you decided to drive your car in what can best be described as an extremely dangerous way.

'There are three injured victims here, perhaps more, but thankfully they were minor injuries compared with what they could have been.

He added: 'How on earth you smashed into a pub and no one was seriously hurt was only luck. You also tried to move away to avoid arrest by driving down the road again.'

In pursuit: Eastwood's vehicle is chased down as he can be seen mounting the pavement when another vehicle drives towards him

The court heard how Eastwood had been on leave from the army when the incident occurred on October 27 and that he was traumatised by the recent 
death of his older brother.

During the incident Eastwood drove into the side of Caroline Watson, before running over Andy Pearce.

Lucky: Andy Peace, 32, broke his foot when Eastwood's vehicle ran over him. He eventually pulled the keys from the vehicle's ignition

The 32-year-old, who later pulled the keys from the vehicle's ignition, had dived in front of the car to push his friend out of the way.

He also crashed into the patio tables outside a pub as terrified customers jumped out of the way.

Jonathan Steel was trapped by the furniture as the vehicle hurtled into the pub.

He said: 'He just ploughed into the pub. I was pinned against the wall. I count myself lucky I was not seriously hurt.'

In a bizarre sequence captured on 
CCTV, Eastwood then reversed off as men in fancy dress, security guards 
and Mr Peace chased him along the road.

Recalling
the incident, Mr Pearce said: 'He mounted the path. I heard an engine 
and I turned and saw the car in front of me and it ran straight over my 
feet. I ran after him, I swung my arm into the driver's window and 
grabbed the keys to stop him driving off again. I wanted to hit him.'

He added: 'It was like there was 
nobody behind the wheel. When I looked at him, he looked out of it. It 
was like he was looking through me, not at me.

'The police said he was so legless, he couldn't stand up'

Eastwood, of Thanet Road, east Hull, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving and drink-driving.

His solicitor, Jo Golding, described the CCTV as a 'graphic depiction of dangerous driving'.

She said: 'It is right to say it was a
moment of motoring madness. Mercifully, there were no serious injuries 
as a result of his actions.'

Approaching: Officers close in on Eastwood but he attempts to drive off, top of the screen

'The
Army has a zero-tolerance on drink-driving and he is now effectively 
out of the Army. He wanted to fight for his country and he will not be 
able to do that now.'

Recorder
Cook told him: 'It seems to me you have lost a lot in life in the last 
few months. You tragically lost your brother and your Army career. You 
were prepared to go to Afghanistan and put your body on the line and I 
think you should have credit for that.

'You need to move on. If you drink, drink in moderation and stay well clear of cars.'

Eastwood was given a 12-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, and ordered to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work.

He was banned from driving for 18 months and ordered to take an extended driving test.

Making a scene: Crowds of revellers begin to approach the scene after being alerted to the commotion

All over: As a crowd looks on, Eastwood is eventually pulled from his vehicle, out of picture
