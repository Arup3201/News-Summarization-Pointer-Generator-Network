Oldham Atheltic have revealed the club's fans and staff received death threats as the club attempted to sign convicted rapist Ched Evans.

The League One side were forced to pull out of a deal to sign the former Sheffield United striker after intolerable pressure from sponsors and fans  extended to threats and 'vile abuse' on social media aimed at the club's staff.

In a statement released on Thursday afternoon, the Latics said proceeding with a deal to sign the former Sheffield United striker 'could have placed significant financial pressure on the club and continued to be a divisive influence.'

The statement released on the club's official website, which was also read out to the media by chief executive Neil Joy, said: 'It has been widely reported that Oldham Athletic will not be signing Ched Evans, which we can now confirm.

'The whole issue has divided opinion and the club has been put under unbearable pressure as a result.

'Proceeding could have placed significant financial pressure on the club and continued to be a divisive influence. As a consequence the deal could not go ahead.

'As a club we condemn all crime including rape and irrespective of any appeal procedure it was always the case that we were prepared to withstand the barrage of abuse that is evident within the country and on social media.

'We deplore and condemn the vile and abusive threats, some including death threats, which have been made to our fans, sponsors and staff whilst this process has been in the public domain.

'Finally, we would like to place our gratitude to all who have supported the club during this difficult period, including the club staff, who have acted with professionalism at all times.

'We understand Ched has released his own statement on his website.

'The club will not be making any further statement on this matter.'
