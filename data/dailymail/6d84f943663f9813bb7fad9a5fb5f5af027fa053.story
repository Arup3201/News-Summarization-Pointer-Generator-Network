Actor Michael Jace has waived his right to a preliminary hearing of the charge that he murdered his wife.

The decision on Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court means the case will proceed to trial without an initial presentation of evidence to a judge.

The actor's attorney, Jason Sias, said outside court that the case is still under investigation and the defense will be presented at trial.

Jace, 51,is accused of shooting his wife, April Jace, in their Los Angeles home on May 19. He pleaded not guilty during his June arraignment. 

The couple's children, both under 10, were home at the time and unharmed. The boys are now living with relatives. 

Police have not disclosed a motive for the slaying but have said they were looking into whether financial or other domestic issues may have been involved.

The family of April Jace has called her death a senseless act of domestic violence. Police said Michael Jace called 911 to report the killing.

Audio of Jace's call has not been made public, but fire officials have released a 911 call from April Jace's father in which he says the actor told him he had shot the victim.

'My son-in-law called me, and (texted) me, and said come get the kids because he shot April, our daughter,' the caller, whose name was redacted from the audio, told a fire department dispatcher.

April Jace, 40, a financial aid counselor at Biola University, had three sons, including the two with Michael Jace.

Jace played a police officer on The Shield TV series, appeared in the show Southland and had small roles in such movies as Boogie Nights and Forrest Gump.
