Nick Pollard has admitted not including the claim that then-director general Mark Thompson knew about the Newsnight investigation into Savile

BBC chairman Chris Patten is facing claims he helped cover up key evidence about the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal.

For
three months, Lord Patten has been aware of a secret tape in which the 
author of the official £3million inquiry into the debacle said he made a
‘mistake’ in his final report.

In
a recording leaked online yesterday, Nick Pollard admitted ignoring 
bombshell claims suggesting the BBC’s former director-general was 
specifically warned about the disgraced DJ’s sex abuse yet allowed 
glowing tributes to be screened after Savile’s death.

Despite
being handed a transcript of the conversation in September, Lord Patten
has repeatedly refused to reopen the investigation and even warned one 
MP he could be sued if he attempted to publish it.

At
the heart of the row is a conflict between one of the BBC’s most 
powerful female executives, director of radio Helen Boaden, and former 
director-general Mark Thompson, now chief executive of the New York 
Times.

Mr Thompson was in 
charge of the BBC when a devastating TV report into Savile’s predatory 
past was shelved, sparking a wave of recriminations that culminated in 
the resignation of his successor.

His
repeated assurances that he was never told about the sex-abuse 
allegations were accepted by the Pollard inquiry. In the official report
published a year ago, Mr Pollard said he had ‘no reason to doubt Mr 
Thompson’s account’.

But in 
the tape recording, Mr Pollard privately admitted to a journalist that 
his report had been flawed. He had been handed a letter by lawyers 
acting for Miss Boaden which directly contradicted Mr Thompson’s 
evidence.

She said she 
warned Mr Thompson about the contents of the Newsnight investigation in a
phone call in December 2011, weeks before a Christmas tribute to Savile
aired.

Mr Pollard was asked to examine the events which lead up to Newsnight abandoning its investigation into allegations of abuse against Savile, which were later revealed in an ITV documentary

Former BBC director of news Helen Boaden informed the Pollard review that she had told then-director-general Mark Thompson about a proposed Newsnight report into Savile - something Mr Thomson denies

The BBC Trust denied that chairman Lord Patten had threatened Tory MP Rob Wilson with legal action if he released the tape

In the recording, Mr
Pollard – who was paid £96,000 for eight weeks’ work – admits it was a 
‘mistake’ to leave the claims out of his report. Pressure is now growing
on Lord Patten to explain why he has not reopened the inquiry.

He
was accused of trying to suppress the truth by warning  Tory MP Rob 
Wilson, who tried to publish the recording this week, that he should be 
‘weighing up the legal liabilities that might arise’.

Tory
MP Philip Davies, who sits on the Commons culture media and sport 
committee, said the chairman’s position is ‘untenable’, adding: ‘Lord 
Patten has become a joke. Any credibility he had left has completely 
evaporated.’

Last night, the
BBC Trust said it was taking the recording ‘seriously’ and had passed 
it on to Mr Pollard so he can give his version.

A
spokesman added: ‘There was no legal threat – the letter merely 
suggested Mr Wilson might want to satisfy himself the recording was not 
defamatory, should he decide to release it.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
