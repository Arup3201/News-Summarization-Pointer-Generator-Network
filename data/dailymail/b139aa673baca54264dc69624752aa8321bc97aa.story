Menelik Watson always harboured dreams of playing at Wembley Stadium when he was growing up in Manchester, but he never believed he would be appear there today as an NFL player.

The League’s International Series returns to the capital as the Oakland Raiders ‘host’ the Miami Dolphins in the ninth fixture to be played in London since 2007, when Sunday’s ‘away’ side first ventured to the UK to play a regular-season game against the New York Giants.

Seven years ago the idea of a career in American Football was completely alien to Watson, who grew up in impoverished conditions in Longsight wanting to play for his beloved Manchester City only to see those hopes — along with his aspirations of playing professional basketball — dashed. 

Menelik Watson is over the moon to realise one of his childhood dreams and play at Wembley this weekend

Now, after just three seasons in his new sport, he is back home in England hoping to help the Raiders kick-start their season with their first victory in front of his mum and daughter, who have never seen Watson (left) play live before.

‘As a kid, we all had dreams to play in the Premier League and that sort of stuff,’ he said.

‘Playing in the FA Cup at Wembley was always something you dreamed of as a kid. But American Football-wise, no. Not even after I got drafted.

‘I watched the Pittsburgh Steelers out here last year versus Minnesota Vikings and then I didn’t really think about it until the schedule came out. It’s like a dream, really.’
