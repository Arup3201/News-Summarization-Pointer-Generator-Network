An irate monkey attacked a small boy during a trip to a zoo while the child's father and a zookeeper fought to prise them apart.

The boy - named locally as Raghav - was seriously hurt at an animal centre in Ratlam, Madhya Pradesh, India.

Pictures taken by a bystander show the child pinned to the floor by the primate with blood on his hands and face.

The attack comes weeks after a bear was videoed attacking a man in the Krishnagiri district in Tamil Nadu, India, after he had helped rescue it from a well.

Large parts of India are plagued by monkeys who steal food, mug people and break into homes.

It has resulted in monkey-catchers being employed to help keep them in check.Â
