She is famous for her unorthodox style 
and outlandish views on fashion, and even at 71 years of age Vivienne 
Westwood's eponymous label is still going from strength to strength.

But super fans like the Duchess of Cornwall and Anne Hathaway will be unable to snap up the Dame's latest collection, because it's been designed solely for Richard Branson's staff.

The high priestess of quirky British fashion has teamed up with Virgin Atlantic to redesign its iconic red uniform.

What a team! Vivienne Westwood has joined forces with Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic to redesign their iconic red uniforms

The collaboration between the two British brands is a long-term partnership which will see a total re-design of the uniform across all areas.

Known for their pristine work attire and lashings of red lippie, the trolley dolly's will be kitted out in glamorous yet practical clothing, which will reference 40s couture cuts and Saville Row tailoring.

The ladies will don an iconic red 
Westwood suit with a very feminine silhouette, 
nipped in at the waist and with double pleats.

While the men will wear a three-piece Saville Row suit 
in a rich burgundy colour.

Always one to promote his own brand, Richard Branson posed in some pictures alongside the fashion designer and could not be more excited about working with her.

The President of Virgin Atlantic said: 'Virgin Atlantic has a distinct spirit and from a design perspective we continually try to challenge the norm and stand out from the crowd.

'Our current uniform has been around for more than 10 years and we have seen other airlines start to copy it.

'When we were choosing the designer for this project, we wanted to work with a group of people who share our spirit of adventure, who believe in challenging the status quo and creating something truly memorable.'

Vivienne Westwood added: 'My clothes have always got a very strong dynamic rapport with the body- they are very body conscious, they help you to look glamorous, more hourglass, more woman.

'I design things to help people to hopefully express their personality.

'I am always trying to find fabrics that are more friendly to the environment - working with Virgin Atlantic they managed to research into this and find more eco fabrics.'

As an avid charity ambassador, Westwood has also introduced 
recycled bags for the ground staff which will be produced for Virgin 
through the Ethical Africa Programme, in collaboration with the 
International Trade Centre (ITC).

The bags will be created using 
recycled canvas, reused roadside banners, unused leather off-cuts, and 
recycled brass, produced in the Kibera slum, Nairobi, where discarded 
metal like padlocks and car pieces are collected then melted down.

Quirky: Vivienne, whose fans include the Duchess of Cornwall and Anne Hathaway, is known for her quirky style but her designs for Virgin will be a lot more classic

Over 7,500 lucky members of staff including cabin crew, pilots, Clubhouse staff and Virgin Holidays employees will be kitted out in the stylish new uniforms from the iconic designer and employees have been involved throughout the design process.

Passengers will receive a sneak peek of the new uniforms from July 2013 when cabin crew and ground staff trial the uniform at the airports and on board.
