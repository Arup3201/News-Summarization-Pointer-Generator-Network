Ashley Giles has been confirmed as Lancashire's new cricket director and head coach.

Former England limited-overs coach, and Ashes-winning spinner, Giles fills the vacancy created after Lancashire stalwart Mike Watkinson stepped down from his position as cricket director.

A statement on Lancashire's website said: 'Lancashire County Cricket Club is delighted to announce the appointment of Ashley Giles as its Cricket Director and Head Coach.'

Ashley Giles was England's limited-overs coach between 2012 and the start of this year

Giles added: 'Lancashire is a massive club with a rich pedigree and history, and I am thrilled by the prospect of coaching them.

'Emirates Old Trafford is a stunning international venue with excellent facilities, and I cannot wait to work with the players and staff.

'It is our intention to return to Division One - but our main aim is create something both successful and sustainable, which a club with such an incredible history deserves.'

Giles' twin role suggests veteran club captain Glen Chapple will not be combining the responsibility of leading the team on the field next season and coaching off it.

The task facing Giles will be to revive Lancashire's fortunes, after they were relegated from LV= County Championship Division One on the final day of the season in last month's shoot-out with Middlesex at Old Trafford.

Giles, 41, was England's limited-overs coach between 2012 and the start of this year.

He missed out to former Lancashire coach Peter Moores when the England and Wales Cricket Board combined the posts in charge of the Test and limited-overs teams six months ago. 

He has now joined Lancashire CC as coach, the club that fellow Ashes-winning team-mate Freddie Flintoff (right) made a return to cricket with earlier this year

Giles had a successful period coaching Warwickshire, after retiring as a player.

He was most recently linked with the coaching vacancy at Somerset - and when Matthew Maynard landed that job, Giles immediately became a front-runner should the opportunity arise at Old Trafford.

Lancashire chairman Michael Cairns said: 'Ashley Giles is a highly respected and regarded coach with a track record of success in the county game, and has a tremendous amount of international experience garnered through a playing and coaching career.

'He is an exceptional candidate for a county like Lancashire, and we are delighted to have secured his services.'
