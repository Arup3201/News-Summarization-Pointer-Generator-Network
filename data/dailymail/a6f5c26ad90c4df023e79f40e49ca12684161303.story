Excavations of an ancient synagogue found in a city where Mary Magdalene is thought to have lived have thrown up clues about how the Jewish and Christian religions developed.

Jewish artefacts found at the site in Migdal on the shore of the Sea of Galilee - previously known as Magdala - include a table carved with a Menorah, yet the temple itself, as well as a coin, discovered on the site dates back to the time of Jesus and the rise of Christianity in the region. 

Archaeologists believe this combination suggests Jews and Christians may have once used the holy site to worship together, according to Israeli news site Haaretz, and it could lead to discoveries about how and when Jesus and Magdalene met. 

Excavations of an ancient synagogue in the town of Migdal in Israel, pictured, have thrown up clues about how the Jewish and Christian religions developed. Jewish artefacts have been found at the site on the shore of the Sea of Galilee - previously known as Magdala - yet the temple itself dates back to the time of Jesus

The synagogue ruins, pictured, were first uncovered in 2009 and they are thought to date back around 2,000 years. The mixture of Jewish artefacts and a coin found from 29AD - a year before Jesus is said to have arrived in the area - suggests Jews and Judeo-Christians may have once used the holy site to worship together

Migdal is the modern-day name for the village of Magdala,  situated on the northwestern shore of the Sea of Galilee at the foot of Mount Arbel.

Magdala is said to have been the hometown of Mary Magdalene, one of 
Jesus' most loyal followers.

She is referred to in the gospels as Mary, and it is believed that her name was a variation of 'Mary from Magdala'.

Researchers are studying the site looking for clues about how and when Magdalene first met and began following Jesus.

The synagogue was first uncovered in 2009 dating back to the 1st Century - around 2,000 years ago.

It measures 11 x 11 metres, and the walls of the room plus the six columns that supported the ceiling, which was probably made of wooden beams and mortar, would have been covered with frescoes painted in seven colours including dark red, yellow and blue panels in black and white frames.

The excavation revealed the synagogue was renovated in around 40 of 50 C.E, before being abandoned shortly before 68 C.E.

This year is significant because it was the time of the Great Revolt of the Jews against the Romans.

Archaeologists have also uncovered  various Jewish artefacts, which Haaretz describes as 'firsts in archaeological excavations, in Israel and even worldwide.'

However, a coin found on the site dated back to 29 A.D - a year before Jesus is said to have arrived in the area and four years before his crucifixion - making it potentially a location of interest for Christianity as well.

Migdal is the modern-day name for the village of Magdala,  situated on the northwestern shore of the Sea of Galilee at the foot of Mount Arbel. Magdala is said to have been the hometown of Mary Magdalene.

Magdalene is described as one of Jesus' most loyal followers and it is also thought she was one of the first people to speak to him after his resurrection. 

She is referred to in the gospels as Mary, and it is believed that her name was a variation of 'Mary from Magdala'.

However, there is no direct connection with Mary and the town of Magdala in the bible.

Researchers are studying the site looking for clues about how and when Magdalene first met and began following Jesus.

Father Juan Maria Solana, director of the Magdala Center told Public Radio International: From the Jewish point of view, the 
position is clear; it’s a first-century synagogue.

The dig is being carried out by archaeologist Dina Avshalom-Gorni and Arfan Najar with Marcela Zapata. They are hoping to find clues as to how and when Jesus came to the town and met Magdalene. The project is being underwritten by the Ark New Gate Company, which is building the Magdala Center, pictured

'From the Christian point of 
view, we cannot doubt that Jesus would have been there sometime.

Yet Marcela Zapata, from the Anáhuac University of Southern Mexico City told on The Huffington Post: 'there is no archaeological evidence to prove Jesus ever set foot inside.'

The dig at Magdala is co-directed by Israel Antiquities archaeologist Dina Avshalom-Gorni and Arfan Najar in collaboration with Marcela Zapata from the Anáhuac University of Southern Mexico City.

It is being underwritten by the Ark New Gate Company, which is building the nearby Magdala Center.
