Click here for your ultimate stats guide from the game including Fernando Torres' winning goal

And so a season in which Jose Mourinho has regularly bemoaned his lack of a quality striker ended with a match-winner from Fernando Torres.

The Â£50million British record transfer did not appear especially overjoyed to find the net. He rarely does, these days.

Likewise Mourinho did not appear too thrilled to finish with a win which could not prevent him recording the lowest league position in any full season of his managerial career.

Cardiff were already doomed but Craig Bellamy's heavily deflected shot gave them the lead before Andre Schurrle turned the game, scoring an equaliser six minutes after coming on as a sub, and setting up Torres, two minutes later.

Mourinho said it was 'no drama' to 
trail in third behind Manchester City and Liverpool after 11 years of 
never finishing below second. Chelsea have seven points more than last 
year and are closer to the champions.

'We
 need to improve, we know that,' said Mourinho, set to become the first 
manager to survive a trophyless season under Roman Abramovich. 'We can 
improve as a team. We can improve our killer instinct and score more 
goals with less chances.

'We
 won't run from that responsibility, the club won't run from the 
responsibility to bring in a couple of important players and I will not 
run from my work.

'We don't 
need a new spine or a new structure. It's a couple of players of a 
certain level to help the team go immediately to a different level. Our 
work in the summer is not big. It's just the right choice and being 
successful, because many clubs know what they want and they try but they
 cannot get it.'

Torres, with two years on his contract, is among those 
most likely to leave, although the manager was not about to confirm it.

'I
 think he will be at Chelsea,' said Mourinho. 'I don't know. The summer 
is long and a lot of things can happen. We want to bring in a striker. 
Fernando and Demba Ba have contracts. No problem if they stay at the 
club if they are happy and committed.'

Ashley Cole, out of contract, 
captained the team and there was another lingering exchange with the 
travelling fans.

'He was not
 the captain to say goodbye in a nice way, he was captain because he was
 the player with the most years at Chelsea,' said Mourinho, but it was 
not convincing. It certainly looked like a farewell.

Cardiff
 bid goodbye to the Barclays Premier League with a blue protest. Owner 
Vincent Tan told the BBC ahead of the game that he would consider 
reverting to traditional colours if they returned to the top flight, but
 if he really wants to unite this club there is only one place to start.

Fans
 made their feelings clear on Sunday, raising their blue-and-white 
scarves in defiance and unfurling banners which accused him of ruining 
the club.

Manager Ole Gunnar
 Solskjaer talked for three-and-a-half hours with Tan on the eve of the 
game and has agreed to be part of the future. Local hero Bellamy is out 
of contract and among those who could leave.

'There
 will be a few changes,' said Solskjaer. 'It has been a long and trying 
season for everyone and we need time to reflect and think about where we
 are going. In the Championship, the spirit of the squad will be as 
important as the quality.

'Mentally,
 it is testing. There is less glamour. We've got to have lads who love 
playing football and not those who love the other side of football, with
 the cars and all the flash bits.'
