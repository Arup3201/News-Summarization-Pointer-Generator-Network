Mother-of-three Lucy Mbugua of Selly Park, Birmingham, lied on a social security form by claiming she had the right to live in Britain. She claimed £26,000 over nearly four years

A fraudster who stole more than £26,000 in benefits after being ordered to quit the UK has been spared prison.

Mother-of-three Lucy Mbugua of Selly Park, Birmingham, lied on a social security form by claiming she had the right to live in Britain.

In fact, the 40-year-old’s bid to stay in the UK had already been rejected three years before she filled in the document in September 2009.

Mbugua, from Kenya, had been convicted of three offences of dishonestly claiming taxpayers’ cash while having no right to remain in the country.

She picked up a total of £26,356 over a period of almost four years.

Mbugua was handed a nine-month suspended sentence at Birmingham Crown Court.

Judge Elizabeth Fisher told her: 'I could send you to prison but I don’t intend to do so.

'You are a lady of hitherto good character and have shown a capability to work hard and undertake your family responsibilities.'

The court heard Mbugua entered the country legally from Kenya in 2003.

But she lost the right to work when her application to remain after 2006 was turned down.

She was forced to quit her job as a housekeeper, prompting her bid for benefits, when a former employer asked to see her passport.

Simon Mortimore, prosecuting, said she ticked a box confirming she was entitled to live in the UK when she made her claim on September 17, 2009.

He said: 'She admitted she knew she would not have received benefits if she ticked "no".

'She says she never intentionally lied.'

Mr Mortimore said Mbugua now had the right to remain in the UK until 2016 pending her latest appeal to stay in the country.

Theresa Hunt, defending, said Mbugua had been shunned by her community after her fraudulent claims were revealed.

She told the court: 'She found herself in a difficult position. She lost her job and was unable to care for the basic needs of her daughters.

'So she chose to tick the box on the form
 saying she had a permanent right to remain. She only had the right to 
stay as long as her appeal was with the Home Office.'

Miss Hunt said Mbugua was now training to be a carer and wanted to repay the cash she claimed.

Judge Fisher was once labelled Britain’s softest after 10 of the sentences she dished out to criminals were increased on appeal.

In 2009 the Birmingham Mail reported that she had the most decisions overruled for excessive leniency between 2003 and 2008.

The attorney-general’s office released the list and most of the judges on it had only one case referred - Judge Fisher had seven.

In five of them, involving a total of 10 defendants, the sentences were increased.

In one case involving a sexual assault, her sentence was described by senior judges as 'wholly inadequate'.
