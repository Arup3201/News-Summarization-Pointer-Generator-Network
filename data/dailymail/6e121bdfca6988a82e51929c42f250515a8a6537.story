There are no brutal climbs, terrifying descents or ferocious man-eating beasts, but walking London's Thames Path has been named one of the world's greatest escapades.

The capital's section of the trail that runs from its source in the Cotswolds almost to the North Sea came second in Lonely Planet's top 10 'city hikes'.

The 29-mile section of Thames Path from Kingston
 eastwards to Greenwich is described in the book as 'a London highlights
 reel, passing Kew Gardens, Battersea Park and power station, 
Westminster and Big Ben, the Millennium Eye, Shakespeare's Globe and so 
on'.
