The 'Peru Two' arrested for smuggling drugs in South America are set to spend Christmas in jail after a strike by court staff delayed attempts to get them released.

Melissa Reid and fellow smuggler Michaella McCollum, both 20, were due to appear in court today but industrial action meant the case could not be heard, it was reported.

The pair, who had hoped a plea deal would get them home to Britain for Christmas, have now been warned they will not be seen by a judge for at least another five months.

Reid and McCollum had hoped the deal would be agreed with a judge so they could apply to serve their sentence in the UK.

A source close to Reid, of Lenzie, near Glasgow, and Ulsterwoman McCollum told the Daily Record: 'It is devastating news for them.'

The women were caught in August smuggling £1.5million worth of cocaine out of Peru.

McCollum
and Reid initially claimed they were kidnapped, held at gunpoint and 
forced to board a flight from Lima to Spain with 24lbs of cocaine in 
food packets hidden inside their luggage when they were arrested.

But
in September McCollum, from Dungannon, Co Tyrone, and co-accused Reid, 
from Glasgow, pleaded guilty to drug smuggling when they appeared before
a judge.

In a video, Reid says she was forced to take 'these bags' in her luggage. She says she didn't know there were drugs inside them

They had hoped the behind-closed-doors admission would be enough to secure a shorter sentence

Prosecutors have now approved the deal, leaving a judge to make the final decision,the Daily Record reported.

If
their pleas are turned down by the court, prosecutors could force them 
to return to the interrogation room and give more details about the 
smuggling gang which allegedly gave them the drugs.
