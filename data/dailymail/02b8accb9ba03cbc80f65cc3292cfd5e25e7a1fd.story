President Barack Obama has launched a new program to help African American and Latino boys with a personal speech during which he talked about the low points in his youth.

'I made bad choices. I got high, not 
always thinking about the harm it could do. I didn't always take school 
as seriously as I should have. I made excuses. Sometimes I sold myself 
short,' Obama said in the East Room of the White House on Thursday.

His comments about his teenage years came as he launched the program called 'My Brother's Keeper' which plans to strengthen efforts in creating more opportunities for young black and Latino men.

Men of color: President Obama introduced a new program that will spend $200million over five years in an effort to help increase mentorship opportunities for young minorty Americans and strengthen family life

He said that the program aims to improve conditions that keep these young men impoverished and imprisoned in disproportionate numbers.

Obama said these young men consistently do worse in society, with odds stacked against them.

'By almost every measure the group that's facing some of the most severe challenges in the 21st century in this country are boys and young men of color,' Obama said, ticking off statistics on fatherhood, literacy, crime and poverty.

'We assume this is an inevitable part of American life instead of the outrage that it is,' Obama said, to applause.

He was not entirely pessimistic, noting that the fact that he was elected as a mark of improvement.

'My presence is a testament to that progress,' Obama said.

Obama spoke while flanked by teenagers involved in the Becoming a Man program to help at-risk boys in his hometown of Chicago. He said he sees himself in them.

Historic: The launch of the program is set to calm minority critics who have faulted the president for not doing enough while in office

Under Obama's initiative, businesses, foundations and community groups would coordinate their investments to come up with, or support, programs that keep youths in school and out of the criminal justice system, while improving their access to higher education.

Several foundations pledged at least $200million over five years to promote that goal.

Meanwhile, Obama signed a presidential memorandum creating a government-wide task force to evaluate the effectiveness of various approaches, so that federal and local governments, community groups and businesses will have best practices to follow in the future.

Valerie Jarrett, a senior White House adviser, said Thursday marks the start of an effort that the president and first lady Michelle Obama plan to undertake 'for the rest of their lives.'

'That's a moral, social responsibility that they feel will transcend the time that he's president,' Jarrett said.

Connecting: The President was introduced by Christian Champagne from Chicago, and the pair bonded over their mutual love of the hometown baseball team, the White Sox

Leadership: Like the other young men on the stage, Christian is a part of the Becoming A Man program which runs in Chicago that was used as a roadmap for the larger nationwide program launched today

Obama's pledge to take action came during his State of the Union address last month, when he warned that young, black men face "especially tough odds to stay on track and reach their full potential.'

Obama himself grew up in a single-parent household, and has said he and some members of his staff were challenged and tempted by the same societal ills plaguing younger generations of minority males.

The White House listed a litany of facts showing the need for the effort: the unemployment rate for African-American men over the age of 20 was 12 per cent last month, compared with 5.4 per cent for white men.

Hispanic men over the age of 20 faced an unemployment rate of 8.2 per cent.

Special guests: Trayvon Martin's parents, Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, were in the audience at Thursday's speech- the day after the second anniversary of Trayvon's death

Famous face: Former Los Angeles Laker Magic Johnson attended both the speech and a meeting about the initiative on Thursday

The U.S. Census Bureau showed a 
poverty rate of 27.2 per cent in black households and 25.6 per cent for 
Hispanic households in 2012, compared with 12.7 per cent in white and 
11.7 per cent in Asian households.

The
 phrase 'my brother's keeper' comes from the book of Genesis in the 
Bible, where God asks Cain, the son of Adam and Eve, for the location of
 his brother Abel, who Cain had killed.

In
 some versions, Cain replies: 'Am I my brother's keeper?' Obama has 
quoted those Bible verses several times during his presidency, saying 
Americans should look out for each other.

Freed from the pressure of seeking re-election, Obama also has taken a more visible role on issues affecting minorities.

The
 president, who famously said â€” 'I'm not the president of black America.
 I'm the president of the United States of America' â€” has moved to 
commute sentences for nonviolent drug offenders, hoping to combat 
sentencing disparities that disproportionately imprison minorities.

Mayors in (and out of) charge: Chicago Mayor and former Obama chief of staff Rahm Emanuel and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg attended the event on Thursday

Attorney General Eric Holder, this month encouraged states to repeal laws that permanently bar felons from voting even after they have served their sentences.

And Obama identified personally with the issue last year when he declared, after the acquittal of George Zimmerman, that Trayvon Martin, the black teenager killed in an encounter with Zimmerman in Florida, 'could have been me 35 years ago.'

Both Trayvon's parents and the parents of Jordan Dunn, who was killed by a white man who got into an altercation with him about the volume of his music, were in the audience at Mr Obama's event today.

The White House has been strongly criticized by some civil rights leaders for not using the presidential bully pulpit to do enough to address generations of disadvantage borne by the African-American community.

But things are changing, said NAACP Interim President Lorraine Miller, who along with other civil rights groups met with the president in the White House last week.
