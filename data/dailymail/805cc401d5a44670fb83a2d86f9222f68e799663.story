Clad in a red sweatshirt with a special message, the little boy searched anxiously for his father amid a sea of camouflage and Tam o’Shanters.

Luckily, father and son were soon reunited as Corporal Scott Boyle spotted his two-year-old son - also called Scott - and gathered him up in his arms.

The little boy beamed as he was hugged by his father, home again after eight months in Helmand Province.

To mark their return, The Royal 
Highland Fusiliers, 2nd Battalion of the Royal Regiment of Scotland, 
marched in a homecoming parade through Ayr town centre yesterday.

A
 bystander said: ‘He was delighted to see his dad – he ran up the road 
to him, his arms outstretched. His dad, who seemed a bit shy, picked him
 up and hugged him. His mum looked delighted.’

The
 battalion of around 400 soldiers attended a service at the Auld Kirk of
 Ayr, before parading through the town and disbanding to meet loved ones
 at the town hall.

The local council honoured the battalion with the Freedom of South Ayrshire as a mark of respect. However, the day was tinged with sadness for those who didn’t make it back from Helmand – where three soldiers were killed and a further six injured when a patrol was struck by a bomb.

Lieutenant Colonel Robin Lindsay, commanding officer, said: ‘2 SCOTS are delighted to be home from a hard tour and to be reunited with our loved ones.

‘However, our thoughts have been and will continue to be with the families of the three soldiers who were killed on operations.

‘We have been overwhelmed by the exceptional support received from local communities. It is an honour to accept the Freedom of South Ayrshire.’

The battalion had been based in Helmand since April, with tasks including advising the Afghan police and handing over Nad-e Ali District to Afghan control.

Appropriately accompanied: No parade would be complete without pipes and drums - so the 2 SCOT band joined the Royal Highland Fusiliers as they marched

On April 30, three soldiers were killed and a further six injured when a patrol was hit by an improvised explosive device (IED) in Lashkar Gah.

Though the title no longer confers any special privileges, South Ayrshire Provost Helen Moonie said: ‘The Honorary Freedom of Ayr is given to very few people and that is what makes it such a special thing.

‘I think it’s a very appropriate way to show our appreciation for everything these men and women do for us and others around the world.’

Eyes right: The Fusiliers were honoured with the Freedom of South Ayrshire, before joining their loved ones for an emotional reunion
