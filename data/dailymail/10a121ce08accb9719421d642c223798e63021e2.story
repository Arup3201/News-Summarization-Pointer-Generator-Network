A micro-brewery based in Tooting may have to stop producing an award-winning Citizen Smith-themed beer following objections from actor Robert Lindsay.

The small By The Horns Brewing Company claims to have been told it must stop producing its popular Wolfie Smith Amber Ale if it insists on carrying a label with an image of Lindsay in the guise of Citizen Smith - the hapless Marxist he played in the popular sitcom of the same name between 1977 and 1980.

The brewery, which created the 5.2 per cent strength ale last year as part of a range celebrating life in London, says an agent working for Lindsay made contact to say the actor did not want to be linked with an alcoholic beverage.

By The Horns sells bottles of Wolfie Smith Amber Ale in pubs and shops across London, but says it did not want to risk a legal battle over the label design as it is still only a small business.

Speaking to the Evening Standard, brewer Alex Bull, 28, said: 'We did not feel we could go down the route of a court case.'

'We have considered ways of changing the bottle and cask. We might put a red star over his face, but we want to keep the name,' he added.

'It's a big shame but we are going to have to get rid of Wolfie Smith's well-known face and redesign the bottle that everyone loves,' Mr Bull went on.

Linday's spokesman declined to comment.

The former City finance analyst founded By The Horns with his friend Chris Miles, 29, with the company producing a range of beers based on London life, including Lambeth Walk, Diamond Geezer and Stiff Upper Lip.

But it is their Wolfie Smith Amber Ale product - described as having a light caramel flavour with a big hop finish and a bitter bite - that has proven most popular.

By The Horns began as a Sunday morning hobby, with Mr Bull and Mr Miles using a homebrew kit to create a new batch of beer once a week.

Eventually they realised the beer they were producing was of high enough quality to sell, hich led them to purchase brewing kits big enough for commercial production, which they housed in an industrial premises in Summerstown, south west London.

It was this location that led them to name on of their creations Wolfie Smith Amber Ale, as the site was less than a mile from the setting of the popular 70s sitcom Citizen Smith.

The programme, which was created by Only Fools and Horses writer John Sullivan, starred Lindsay as Marxist 'urban guerilla' Wolfie Smith, whose plans to establish the south London suburb as a Marxist enclave continually fail due to his disorganisation.
