January is the most miserable month of the year. 

Christmas is over, we're recovering from a month of lavish eating, drinking and spending - and there is no end in sight to the cold, dark mornings.

So Femail has teamed up with happiness experts Andy Cope and Andy Whittaker to provide a plan to keep the January blues away.

British happiness experts Andy Cope and Andy Whittaker have a list of cheering daily activities for January

The two men, who have written the best-selling book The Art Of Being Brilliant, devised a month-long plan that includes one chore every day designed to bring happiness.

The challenge is to do the exercises daily until they become happiness habits. 

Read on to learn how to beat the winter blues:  

1 January: Upgrade your knickers so every bit of underwear oozes confidence. Stop saving your special pants for a special occasion and wake up to the fact that life is the ultimate special occasion.

2 January: Do an act of kindness for someone else. This can be as simple as letting someone out in the traffic or buying flowers for the bus driver.

3 January: Catch somebody doing something well and tell them. For example, make a point of thanking someone who gives good customer service or thank your teenager for bringing the plates and cups down from their room.

Your fanciest pants aren't just for special occasions. Breaking out your best underwear will boost confidence

4 January: Practice the 10/5 principle, for instance, smile at everyone who comes within 10 feet of you and make eye contact and say ‘hi’ to everyone within five feet (except on the Tube. I tried it and nearly got arrested).

5 January: Say nice things about people behind their back. This is a double whammy because it gets back to them plus people think you’re a lovely person (which, of course, you are).

6 January: Write a list of ten things you really appreciate but take for granted. ‘Health’ and ‘relationships’ will almost certainly be on there. Stop taking them for granted!

7 January: Every morning, appreciate that you don’t have toothache and that your kidneys are working. Being able to get out of bed is the best thing ever.

8 January: Write a list of the top ten happiest moments of your life and you’ll realise that most of the things on the list are ‘experiences’ rather than ‘products’. Set your stall out to have more experiences.

9 January: Think of someone who has really helped you, perhaps given you time or supported you. Write them a letter from the heart, that says how wonderful they are and what they mean to you. Read it to them (I dare you).

10 January: Instead of asking your partner/kids ‘how was your day?’ change the words and ask (with enthusiasm), ‘what was the highlight of your day?’ Then listen with genuine enthusiasm.

11 January: Walk tall and put a smile on your face (not an inane grin, you will scare people.) Your brain will immediately think you are happy and you’ll feel a whole lot better.

12 January: Change your aim. Stop setting your sights on ‘getting through the week’ or ‘surviving until my next holiday’. Raise your game. Set your aim to ‘enjoy the week’ or ‘to inspire people’.

13 January: Write down your top five personal strengths. Be aware of them and start seeing opportunities to play to them more often.

14 January: Reduce your moaning - as a Brit, it’s almost impossible to stop completely - and always remind yourself it's a First World problem.

15 January: When setbacks occur, ask yourself, where is this issue on a scale of one to ten (where ten is death). If it is death, you are allowed to feel down. Anything else, get over it.

16 January: Most people have an internal voice that is very critical. Challenge it. When your inner voice is telling you you’re an idiot, firmly disagree. Find a positive inner voice. Note, this conflict is best done in silence in your head. And if you have lots of inner voices, you need to see your GP.

17 January: Spend less time on electronic friends and more time with real flesh and blood ones.

18 January: Say ‘yes’ to things, all day.

19 January: Praise your children for effort rather than ability. So, for example, if they get a good grade in maths don’t say, ‘Genius, you are the next Einstein.’ Do say, ‘Brilliant! That shows what you can achieve with hard work.’

Spend less time on electronic friends and more time with the real flesh and blood people in your life

20 January: Practice the four-minute rule; that is, be your best self for the first four minutes of arriving at work, being in a meeting or getting home. Your brilliance is infectious.

21 January: Lose the word ‘try’. Instead of setting a resolution of ‘I’m going to try and lose some weight’ or ‘I’m going to try and get a bit fitter’, go with ‘I’m going to lose some weight’ or ‘I’m going to get fitter’. 

Yoda was spot on when he said ‘Do or do not, there is no ‘try’.

22 January: Appreciate that your happiness is bigger than you. It has a ripple effect and infects people three degrees removed from you.

23 January: Read a bedtime story to your kids like it is the most exciting book in the world.

24 January: Reframe situations. For example, a leaking gutter means you have a house; paying tax means you have some income and your teenage son spending hours on his X-Box means he’s not wandering the streets.

(But don’t overdo reframing otherwise you become Pollyanna; ‘Whoopee, grandma’s died, what a fabulous opportunity for a funeral and some lovely sandwiches’ is almost certainly a reframe too far).

Read a bedtime story to your children as if it is the most exciting book in the world

25 January: Rather than a New Year’s resolution, set yourself a HUGG (Huge Unbelievably Great Goal). This is something that is massive and that inspires you, for instance, to write your novel, to run a marathon or to be the best mum in the world.

26 January: Be genuinely interested in other people -  ask loads of questions about them. In a bizarre twist of quantum psychology, people will find you insanely interesting.

27 January: Remember children spell ‘LOVE’, ‘T, I, M, E’ (* see point 23).

28 January: Make sure that you use more positive than negative language. The ratio needs to be about five positives for every negative, so catch people doing things well and tell them.

29 January: Notice the ‘beautiful ordinary’ - the small things that other people rush past. Appreciate that happiness is in the moment so notice sunrises, raindrops, smiles, flowers and smiling children.

30 January: When setbacks occur, rather than beating yourself up in your head, ask yourself, ‘what will I do differently next time?’

31 January: Ask yourself, if there was a version of you sitting on a cloud, watching you go about your tasks today, what advice would the ‘cloud you’ give the ‘earthly you’? 

How would they say you should walk, talk, think and behave? Take that advice.

· At the end of the day, spend five minutes writing down three things that have gone well, and why.

· Commit to doing some exercise. Don’t kill yourself, 20 minutes a day is fine. It might feel like a chore at the time but it releases all sorts of lovely chemicals which will infuse you with a Ready Brek glow.

· Listen (and I mean really listen) to people. Stop finishing their sentences. Tune in and show an interest

· Watch out for the 90/10 principle. This states that 10 per cent of your happiness depends on things that happen to you while a whopping 90 per cent depends on how you react to these events. Make a conscious choice to be positive.

· If you have small children practice what The Happiness Project author Gretchen Rubin calls ‘gazing lovingly’. This means downing tools at the end of the evening and standing at your children’s bedroom door, watching them sleep. The modern world dictates that you only ever do this with your own kids and there is an age limit of ten. After that, the general rule is that you NEVER go in your kids’ bedrooms, just in case).
