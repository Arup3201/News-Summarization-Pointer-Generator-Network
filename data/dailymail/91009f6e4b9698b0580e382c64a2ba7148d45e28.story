Britain's youngest parents went on a romantic weekend away together shortly before their baby was born, it has been revealed.

The mother, 12, and father, 13, who cannot be named for legal reasons, spent time together in a caravan in Clacton--on-Sea last month, shortly before she gave birth to their daughter last weekend.

The pair, from North London, apparently bought a 'True Love' bracelet which they split in half, keeping one part each, and wrote each other's names in the sand.

According to The Sun the young mother then wrote a gushing message about her partner on Facebook and posted pictures of the break, alongside another picture she posted of her primary school leaving party.

The trip took place a month ago, around the time the girl's father claims he found out about the tryst, which he claims was carried out behind his back.

In an interview with LBC Radio, a man claiming to be the girl's father said he had only found out a month ago that his daughter was pregnant, around the same time the two went away together.

He said: 'Unfortunately kids this age are going to grow up to have boyfriends and partners or whatever.

'If they do things behind their parents back that's something we're never going to be able to find out.

'We only found that she was actually pregnant a month ago. For us what can you do?'

The pair are thought to have stayed in a static caravan, much like this one (file picture). They also bought a bracelet with 'True Love' written on it which they split in two, keeping one half each

He also said that the family are 'not scroungers' and will be paying to bring up the child themselves, rather than relying on benefits.

However, in Middlesbrough, the UK's teen pregnancy capital, other teenage mothers are unashamedly admitting to having children for the sake of getting a council house.

Speaking to The Sun, Bryony Fisher, 21, said: 'Many girls do it for the benefits and to get a house. They're quite open about it.'

The former factory town, which boomed in the mid-1800s on the back of the iron-working industry, has a teen pregnancy rate which is more than double the national average.

In 2012, for every 1,00 girls aged 15-17 in Middlesbrough, 68.6 got pregnant, an unexpected rise after several years of falling numbers.

Middlesbrough is the UK's teen pregnancy capital, where the number of young mothers is more than double the UK average. It is also the youth unemployment capital, with some young mothers admitting they got pregnant to increase their benefits

Middlesbrough is also the UK's youth unemployment hotspot, with one in three people under 25 out of work, and is among the worst areas in school results too.

Kelly Warren, who first fell pregnant aged 17, said: 'There's no jobs here so people get bored. They binge drink and then just start fighting.

'A lot don't want to work and just use their kids to get more benefits, but not me. I worked before I was pregnant and I want to work again when my baby is older.'

Middlesbrough Mayor Ray Mallon, a former police superintendent known as 'Robocop' for his no-nonsense attitude to crime, has previously despaired of some of Middlesbrough's worst families.

He alleged that one family had cost the council Â£600,000 a year due to council interventions, and that another mother gave her 13-year-old daughter three ecstasy pills to celebrate her becoming a teenager.
