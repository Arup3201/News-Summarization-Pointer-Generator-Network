A video gamer specializing in role playing fantasy games has been issued two Guinness World Records for her virtual adventures as a night elf, sorcerer, wizard and warrior.

Hecaterina Kinumi Iglesias, who goes by the gaming name Kinumi Cati, holds endurance-based records for popular role playing games Final Fantasy and World of Warcraft.

After two particularly long gaming sessions, the 16-year-old from Spain claimed the Longest Videogame Marathon on Final Fantasy (38 hours and six minutes) and the Longest Videogame Marathon on World of Warcraft (29 hours and 31 minutes).

Final Fantasy is a long running Japanese fantasy role-playing game. The massively successful series is comprised of 15 installments, although there have been countless spin offs for other gaming platforms as well as several movies based on its characters and the world they inhabit.

First created in 1987, players take on the role of a character inside a fictional universe usually filled with fantasy creatures similar to Lord of the Rings, in which good characters and species use magic, sorcery and brawn to battle villains and other evils.

The series is famed for its depth, in which the gamer is immersed into the characters' lives, with a plot that canvasses typical human emotions and experiences such as tragedy, death, love and anger.

Players are motivated by the opportunity to develop their characters with 'experience', making them more powerful and allowing them to use better weapons or magic powers. Experience is typically gained by killing enemies and progressing through the plot.

Ms Iglesias' inspiration behind her records came from wanting to be recognised as a 'good gamer' and to grant her more exposure on her Youtube channel, where she also shares videos of her singing.

Other new gaming record holders include a Tomb Raider fanatic, a Minecraft addict and a German teenager with the highest score on FIFA.

Spaniard Rodrigo Martin Santos owns a staggering 2,383 related Tomb Raider items which has earned him the record for the Largest Collection of Tomb Raider Memorabilia.

The 27-year-old's collection includes the original costume worn by model Rhona Mitra in Tomb Raider 2 and a life size Lara Croft and Rose statue, of which only 50 were made.

Perhaps one of the most quirky new entries is Austrian Minecraft endurance player Martin Fornleitner, 19.

He played the phenomenally successful crafting game for a staggering 24 hours and 10 minutes on his Sony Xperia Play handset, earning him the record for the Longest Videogame Marathon on Minecraft.

He achieved the record in a glass container watched by the public in Vienna back in 2011 and claimed tiredness was his biggest battle throughout the record attempt.

But the score to make FIFA fans around the world envious was achieved by German Patrick Hadler, aged 19, from Hannover.

The teenager holds the title for the Highest Margin of Victory against the Computer on FIFA World Cup 2014 with a 321-0 scoreline.

Patrick believes commitment, focus and a keen eye for goal was at the heart of his success and wanting to 'feel as good as the real life Germany football team'.

A Polish man has set a new world record for the longest ever individual video game session by managing to play a Second World War sniper game for 141 hours and 41 minutes before finally giving up.

Hubert 'Gordon' Blejch picked the shooter game Sniper Elite 3 as his game of choice to set the world record, which was carried out at the Poznan Gaming Arena event in the western Polish city of Poznan.

Mr Blejch was allowed a ten-minute break every hour, which he used to make trips to the bathroom, have medical check-ups, receive massages and take very short naps.

He originally wanted to man the controls for a week, but fatigue got the better of him and he gave in.

Craig Glenday, the Editor in-Chief of Guinness World Records, said: 'Gaming is so dynamic and fast-moving that there's never any shortage of exciting new superlatives for Guinness World Records to explore.

'Speed runs, high scores, technical achievements, collections, cosplaying, you'll find it all the new Gamer's Edition.

'And this year, we're focusing on the most popular games as chosen for by our readers, peppered with interviews, features, hardware profiles and annual awards.

'Video gaming is sure to become the most significant art form of the 21 century and the Gamer's Edition - now in its eighth year - is committed to recording and documenting the increasingly impressive progress being made.'

Guinness World Records 2015 Gamer's Edition is out on November 6.
