Cinemas could be banned from serving supersized fizzy drinks as part of a Government crackdown on obesity.

Department of Health officials are planning a summit meeting of drinks companies and leisure businesses to thrash out a voluntary ban on large sugary drinks, which can contain more than 500 calories each and be more than two pints.

The Government wants to slash the nation’s consumption of fizzy drinks and there are calls by health campaigners for a tax on high-sugar products to be included in next month’s Budget.

The summit will be chaired by Dr Susan 
Jebb, who heads the Government’s Responsibility Deal food network and is
head of diet and population health at the Medical Research Council.

Summit chair: Dr Susan Jebb said some of the drinks on sale were 'huge'

Dr Jebb told The Grocer magazine that some of the drinks on sale were ‘huge’.

The plan comes a week after a national campaign was launched by Weight Watchers in a bid to persuade cinemas to offer healthier food and smaller portions.

Treats sold in cinema foyers, such as large buckets of popcorn, jumbo bags of sweets, hot dogs and giant fizzy drinks are fuelling Britain’s obesity crisis and creating a ‘toxic environment’ for consumers, according to diet experts at the weight-loss organisation. 

Fizzy drinks have been linked to a wide range of ills, including aggression in teenagers, the risk of dying from a stroke and liver damage.
