A young couple who found themselves longing for a simpler life decided to take the matter of their marital abode in their own hands - quite literally.

Malissa and Christopher Tack live in a perfect miniature home which, despite the fact that their combined knowledge of construction amounted to bare minimum, they built themselves.

The Tiny Tack House, as the pair have 
named their cottage-on-wheels, is a 140 sqft wooden structure, complete with kitchen,
living room, bathroom and a sleeping loft in  
Snohomish, Washington.

Malissa, a 3D artist, and Christopher, a graphic designer and photographer, stumbled upon the 'tiny homes' movement online and knew it held the key to their perfect home.

Despite having little to no knowledge of how to build a house - or anything at all for that matter - they spent 800 hours over seven months to build their own home and everything within it.

Thanks to Malissa’s skills as a 3D artist the pair were able to designed it themselves and make a virtual version of their future home, ahead of grabbing hammer and drill.

‘We just had some basic shop class skills from High School’, Malissa Tack explains on their website.

Simple is good: Chris and Malissa Tack traded in the busy life for what they think is the good one - as small as it may seem

Welcome inside: As you enter the Tiny Tack House you walk straight into the living room and office with the bathroom on the left, and the sleeping loft above it and the small kitchen

Cramped kitchen: The couple say living small has made them more considerate and a better couple as there is no way squeezing past unnoticed in the kitchen

Ready, steady, cook: Although the pair relied on professional advice regarding electricity and plumbing, they installed it all themselves

‘The work was done by Chris and myself. There was a few days where the parents flew in to help out with the roof.

‘We had advice help with the electrical and plumbing from a certified person.

‘Just about everyone we know thought we were crazy, but now, everyone loves the idea of the house!'

The
house has four solar panels and is supplied by a 40 gallon fresh water 
tank, making it environmentally, as well as financially, friendly.

Meals on wheels: The pair fit their entire lives, work, sleep and eat in this petite cottage

Picturesque: The house has all the components of a dream home - although some may struggle with the size

The green stuff: The Tiny Tack House is parked on rented land and is partly powered by four solar panels

A
mere six months after the pair moved in to the Tiny Tack House they 
reaped further benefit from their downsizing as Chris lost his job as a 
‘lead creative’ at Apple.

Thanks to their choice to live small,
they are able to ride out the storm as both maintenance and building 
costs were relatively low.

The
Tacks expect to have paid it off completely within two-three years and 
keep costs to bills and rent of the land where the Tiny Tack House is 
parked.

Nighty, night: The sleeping loft is located underneath the roof above the kitchen and bathroom

Cat not included: The pair are now devoting a lot of their time to the tiny homes movement helping others in their bid to downsize and build their own home

Handy work: The married couple have built everything in the Tiny Tack House themselves (apart from the iMac double-functioning as a television)

Back to nature: Despite working in high-tech fields, Malissa as a 3D animation artist and Chris previously at Apple, they wanted a simpler life outside their professions

‘Without the substantially lower cost of living, we would be struggling financially,’ Chris Tack told the Huffington Post,

The Tacks add that living small made them stronger as a couple, and nicer to one another.

The cramped situation forces them to respect the individual's right to their own space and to be more polite, as the tiny kitchen barely allows a squeeze-past.
