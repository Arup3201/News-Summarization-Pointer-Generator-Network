In recent years, astronomers have been astounded by just how much Saturn's moon Titan resembles Earth.

Like our planet, the surface of Titan is covered with lakes and seas; it has islands, mud, rain clouds, river channels and, according to some scientists, even rainbows.

And now the first hints of waves on the seas of the moon have now been revealed. If confirmed, this would be the first discovery of ocean waves beyond Earth.

This image shows the first flash of sunlight reflected off a lake on Saturn's moon Titan. The glint off a mirror-like surface is known as a specular reflection. It confirmed the presence of liquid in the moon's northern hemisphere, where lakes are more numerous and larger than those in the southern hemisphere

In 2012 and 2013, Nasa’s Cassini spacecraft captured several unusual glints of sunlight off the surface of Punga Mare, one of Titan’s hydrocarbon seas.

Those reflections may have been created by tiny ripples, around 2cm high, said Jason Barnes, a planetary scientist at the University of Idaho in Moscow.

Professor Barnes presented the findings at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, according to a report in Nature.

Researchers expect more waves to appear in the next few years, as winds pick up in Titan’s northern hemisphere as it emerges from winter and approaches spring.

With its thick atmosphere and organic-rich chemistry, Titan resembles a frozen version of Earth, several billion years ago, before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere.

Because Titan is less massive than Earth, its gravity doesn’t hold onto its gaseous envelope as tightly, so the atmosphere extends 370 miles (600km) into space.

As on Earth, the climate is driven mostly by changes in the amount of sunlight that come with the seasons, although the seasons on Titan are about seven Earth years long.

Titan's ‘water’ is liquid methane, CH4, 
better known on Earth as natural gas. Regular Earth-water, H2O, would be
 frozen solid on Titan where the surface temperature is 140°C (290°F) 
below zero.

With Titan's low gravity and dense atmosphere, methane raindrops could grow twice as large as Earth's raindrops. As well as this, they would fall more slowly, drifting down like snowflakes. Scientists think it rains perhaps only every few decades.

Knowing how the waves form will help scientists to better understand the conditions in Titan’s lakes and seas.

A Nasa mission proposal, which was beaten by a proposal to return to Mars, would have sent a probe to float in one of Titan’s lakes.

‘If we drop a lake lander in there, is it going to splat instead of splash?’ Professor Barnes asked at the conference.

Regular Earth-water, H2O, would be frozen solid on Titan where the surface temperature is -140°C (-290°F).

The idea that Titan is a wet world with its own alien waters is widely accepted, but the lack of waves has stumped scientists for years.

On Earth, bodies of water are rarely still. 

Breezes blowing across the surface cause waves to ripple and break; raindrops striking sea surfaces also provide some roughness.  

Yet on Titan, the lakes seemed eerily smooth, with no discernible wave action down to the millimetre scale, according to radar data from Cassini.

Centered on the north pole, this map shows Titan's bodies of methane and ethane in blue and black. Roughly heart-shaped, the lake above and right of the pole is Ligeia Mare. Just below the north pole is Punga Mare. This is where Cassini spied several unusual glints of sunlight off the surface in 2012 and 2013

Titan’s gravity, which is only 1/7th that of Earth, also provides very little resistance to wave motion.

Researchers had previously toyed with several explanations, including that the lakes may be frozen or covered with a tar-like substance that damps wave motion.  

If waves appear over the next few years, Cassini should be able to detect them.  Radar reflections from wavy lake surfaces can tell researchers a great deal.  

Wave dimensions, for instance, may reveal the viscosity of the underlying fluid and, thus, its chemical composition.  

Also, wave speeds would track the speed of the overlying winds, providing an independent check of Titan climate models.

Alex Hayes, a planetary scientist on the Cassini radar team, is excited about ‘bringing oceanography to another world. All we need now,’ he said, ‘are some rough seas.'
