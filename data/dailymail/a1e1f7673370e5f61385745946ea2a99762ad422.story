Buckingham Palace has announced it is to lease a new helicopter for members of the Royal Family to fly on official engagements.

The luxury £8 million AgustaWestland A109S can carry up to nine people including the pilots, has leather-covered seats and a top speed of 180mph.

The chopper will be used by all members of the Royal Family, including William and Kate.

While William is a qualified helicopter pilot and has flown with the RAF, it is not known whether he will try his hand at flying the helicopter.

In 2008 William got into trouble after using a £35million Chinook helicopter to fly to a stag do, stopping off in south London to pick up Harry along the way.

The stunt took place just hours after Wills received his wings, meaning he qualified to fly RAF aircraft, and was defended by the MoD as part of his training.

The
new chopper will be used for a year on a trial basis to ascertain whether 
it is more cost effective than hiring out several different aircraft at a
 time.

Safety is also 
utmost in the palace's mind after a Sikorsky S-76C helicopter carrying 
Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall was forced to make a 
terrifying emergency landing last year.

The
 Agusta, which will bear the Royal crest along with its own marking, 
will be based at at RAF Odiham in Hampshire alongside Her Majesty's own 
helicopter.

It will be paid 
for out of the Sovereign Grant - a sum of money given to the Queen by 
the Government each year - which this year stands at £37.9million.

The
 news comes after it was revealed that the cost to taxpayers of 
refurbishing the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s Kensington Palace 
apartment has quadrupled to £4million.

Building
 work on the 22-plus room home has soared by £3million in the last year 
and includes the bill for William and Kate’s new kitchen and several 
bathrooms, the Mail can reveal.

The
 vast project has seen Apartment 1A, which had been used as office space
 since the death of Princess Margaret, transformed into a ‘family home’.

Although
 the couple are personally paying for all fixtures and fittings like 
curtains, carpets and furniture, the cost of building their new bedroom 
and even Prince George’s nursery has come from the public purse.

One
 courtier last night insisted that the Kensington Palace project 
actually offered taxpayers ‘great value’ given the state of the 
crumbling apartment.

But 
questions will be asked as to whether Buckingham Palace, which has 
forked out for the refurbishment, is spending public money wisely.

Fantastic: The Cupola room - part of the King's State apartments at Kensington Palace. Renovations of the couple's Palace flat have now reached £4million

External work: More renovations are made on the building. A spokesman for the Duke and Duchess said the Palace is their 'one and only official residence', where they will live for 'many years to come'

MPs
 have already questioned the use of money on private accommodation after
 discovering that £1million had been spent in 2012/2013.

A
 spokesman for the Duke and Duchess said the Palace is their ‘one and 
only official residence’, where they will live for ‘many years to come’.

But it was last refurbished in 1963 and needed a ‘significant amount of work’ to make it habitable again.

He
 added: ‘The work included significant costs for the removal of 
asbestos, the installation of a new roof, the complete overhaul of 
electrics and plumbing and a significant amount of internal building 
work to return the residence to function as a living space.

‘To put it in perspective, there wasn’t even any running water.’
