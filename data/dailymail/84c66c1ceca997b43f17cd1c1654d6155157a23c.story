One in five immigrants in Europe arrives in Britain, shocking new figures have revealed.

More than 560,000 people moved to Britain in 2011, the highest number in the EU and almost 20 per cent of all migrants moving in and around the continent.

Most of the people moving to the UK come from outside the 27 European Union member states.

One in five of all migrants in Europe settled in Britain in 2011, according to the European Commission's statistics body Eurostat

Latest figures from Eurostat, the 
statistics body of the European Commission, reveal the full scale of 
immigration across nations.

In 2011, the UK topped the immigration league table welcoming 566,000 people, much higher than second place Germany which saw 489,400 migrants arrive. The next highest was Spain with 457,600, followed by Italy on 385,000 and France’s 267,000.

Of those arriving in the UK, 174,100 were from elsewhere in Europe while 313,500 came from outside the EU – by far the largest number and three times the 90,000 who moved to France.

Ministers have been under pressure to curb immigration, ahead of the relaxation of limits on Romania and Bulgaria next year.

Home Secretary Theresa May yesterday announced she was scrapping the dysfunctional UK Border Agency after a disastrous five years in which the backlog of immigration cases grew to 320,000.

A Commons committee this week warned it would take 24 years to clear.

David Cameron used a keynote speech on Monday to pledge to curb access to benefits, housing and the NHS to deter migrants moving to Britain.

According to the Eurostat figures, just over 3 million people arrived in EU countries in 2011, either from around the globe or from other member states.

It means that 18 per cent of all migrants settling in the EU choose Britain.

UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage said: ‘The  statistical evidence is clear. The UK is clearly the one of the favourite ports of call for migration from within the EU.

‘According to the EU, almost half of the 4.8 million people living here who were born elsewhere came from other EU countries.

‘That is a city twice the size of Birmingham. And whatever Mr Cameron says, while we remain in the EU, there is absolutely nothing he can do about it,’ he told the Daily Express.

The coalition insists that more recent figures show immigration into Britain has fallen to its lowest level in nearly a decade.

The number of people coming to live here fell by 74,000 in the 12 months to June last year as curbs on students and workers from outside Europe began to bite.

But Conservative MP Andrew Turner said the EU statistics were ‘alarming’. He told the newspaper:

‘These levels are quite unsustainable. It shows that the Prime Minister’s drive to curb benefit levels for non-UK residents is desperately needed.  We must stop being the easy touch of Europe.’
