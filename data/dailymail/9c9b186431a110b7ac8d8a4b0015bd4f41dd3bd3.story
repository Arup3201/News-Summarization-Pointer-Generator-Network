As BBC cultural icons go, Dave Lee Travis was one of the biggest, and certainly the loudest.

His DJ contemporary Jimmy Savile looked and sounded like the deceitful, dangerous weasel that he was.

Dave Lee Travis, on the other hand, was the big, genial, self-proclaimed ‘Hairy Monster’, a huge personality who in his 1970s and 1980s heyday made millions of loyal female fans feel that he was the kind of man they would turn to in a crisis.

Perhaps even the sort of crisis when a woman realises the attentions of a man have become predatory, and she could do with some help.

None of these fans would have believed then that decades later he would be charged with being one of those predators, surely not DLT who liked to say, ‘Everyone treats me as a friend in the home’.

DLT was one of those BBC superstars – and in his day there were many – who attracted young girls like iron filings to a magnet.

His wife Marianne accepted that he was a flirt, that his style was tactile.

For decades as a Radio 1 institution, and on the television, the bushy-bearded DJ was cheery, loud, and zany. For his early-morning show he adapted his nickname to the ‘Hairy Cornflake’. What other DJ would have introduced the puzzling concept of snooker and darts competitions on a radio show?

He was always publicly opinionated on his shows, and continued to be so. In recent years, after the Savile scandal led to celebrity arrests, he demanded indignantly: ‘Why can’t we list the names and addresses of all the paedophiles they’ve got?’

When they were both BBC DJs, Travis, now 68, would sometimes join Savile at parties.

He admitted he knew of Savile’s reputation with young girls. By young, he added, he meant girls who were 16, 17 or 18.

But he told the police after he himself was arrested: ‘If I knew at that time that Jimmy Savile was a paedophile I would be the first one to get him arrested because it’s the worst crime in the world as far as I’m concerned.’

One of his accusers, now a mother of two, who alleged he assaulted her in an empty studio when she was 17, told the jury: ‘These DJs were big, big stars. They were like pop stars. There would be crowds of people hanging around outside the building to see them. They were like demi-gods.’

No one has suffered heavier blows since DLT was arrested in November 2012 than his blonde Swedish wife, Marianne, whom he married 43 years ago.

She is a small and rather quiet woman described by acquaintances as ‘very sweet and very patient’, and there she was yesterday – as her husband was told he was free to go after almost a month in the dock – calmly brushing a speck of dust from the lapel of his jacket.

Marianne has had breast cancer, from which she is recovering. And she has lost the lovely rambling £1.8 million Buckinghamshire farmhouse where they lived for many years – it had to be sold to pay for her husband’s legal defence.

Home is now a modest cottage into which they moved before the trial began. Selling the house meant removing Dave Lee Travis’s large, semi-nude photographs of women on the walls of the kitchen, as well as the sculpture of the lower half of a woman wearing just a thong that stood by the fridge.

It meant dismantling the unique library that Travis – ‘a permanent adolescent’ according to one friend – kept in the downstairs loo. The books were all about flatulence.

Unlike the family of William Roache, who was acquitted of sexual charges last week, childless Marianne had kept away from the trial until Monday, when the jury retired to consider its verdicts.

‘Marianne has a rare tolerance,’ says a family friend, ‘never seeming to be bothered by his inveterate flirting with young women.

‘She was cool about his fame when he became a bigger star than he had ever thought possible on Top of the Pops and Radio 1.

‘And when his career was on the wane, she persuaded him to accept it with grace, saying that he’d had a good innings. I would say Dave is a very lucky man where Marianne is concerned.’

Marianne even sometimes assisted his lifelong hobby of photography. Those huge photographs in the kitchen were his work.

His subjects, he explained in court, could be a girl he spotted in the pub or walking in the street. He said he would hand them a card so that they could contact him later to arrange a shoot, but only after they had asked their parents’ permission.

He has taken lots of photographs of woman naked and semi-naked, but insisted they were not ‘tacky’. He once persuaded a woman to get her clothes off for a nude shoot after meeting her in the park and telling her he was impressed by a large tattoo on her back.

‘Women just have such fabulous shapes and I wanted to utilise those shapes,’ he declared.

Did Marianne really approve of the photography? ‘It’s fine,’ she told a visiting interviewer.

‘Only fine?’ interjected Travis during the interview.

‘It’s great,’ said Marianne, correcting herself ‘ . . . I don’t know what you want me to say.’

‘The secret of a happy marriage,’ Travis told the interviewer, grinning and putting both hands on her knee in full view of his wife, ‘is never look at another women or touch her knees! That’s the secret of a happy marriage.’

Was he always that flirty, the interviewer asked Marianne. ‘Oh, yes,’ came the reply.

One has to wonder how different things would have been if DLT had remained plain David Patrick  Griffin, born in Buxton, Derbyshire, the son of a stage manager; and if he had stuck to his first job of graphic designer and not felt the pull of the nightlife and excitement of being a DJ.

Once the boy from Manchester Grammar School – then a direct grant grammar but  now one of our leading private schools – realised it was what he wanted, there was no stopping him.

From part time DJ-ing at Manchester’s Oasis club as a 20-year-old (playing the music on his own Dansette record player) he moved in 1965 to the original pirate radio station, Radio Caroline, broadcasting from  off the Essex coast and the  Isle of Man.

Two years later, the BBC launched the new pop station Radio 1, and beckoned in  his direction. It was the start  of 25 years with the BBC  during which he became a household name.

In 1978, he became Radio 1 Breakfast Show host when he took over from Noel Edmonds. At his peak he had nine  million listeners.

By now his face, along with that megawatt voice, was familiar to millions because he was a regular host on Top of the Pops, gold bracelets and pendant necklaces jangling, and always surrounded by waves of excited, star-struck young girls.

He adored the fame. ‘An ego trip,’ he admitted. ‘I love people to come up and greet me with a “Hiya, Dave, how y’doin”.’

In 1980, the National Hairdressers’ Federation named Travis ‘Head of the Year’. In 1992, the pipe-smoking DJ was made Pipe Man of the Year.

But then in 1993, he suddenly resigned from the BBC – on air. ‘Changes are being made here which go against my principles, and I just cannot agree with them,’ he announced to startled listeners.

The reality was that Radio 1 had a new controller who wanted to bring in new voices, and DLT’s contract had only ten weeks to run. He knew his time was up.

The veteran DJ claimed he had faced a 'trial by media' during the proceedings. He said he was 'not delighted at all' by the mixed verdict

Since then he has worked for minor stations such as Classic Gold, BBC Three Counties Radio and Spain’s Spectrum FM.

Most recently, Dave Lee Travis was broadcasting each weekend from his own studio in his home for Magic AM, going out to eight radio stations in the North.

He also presented a music request programme called A Jolly Good Show on the BBC World Service with upwards of 40 million listeners round the world. One letter from India addressed simply ‘DLT, England’, arrived safely on his desk.

Another fan was Burmese pro-democracy leader and Nobel prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, who revealed after being freed from 15 years of house arrest that listening to his show had made her world ‘much more complete’.

The job didn’t pay anything like the big money he used to earn, of course, but almost 50 years after he started out as a DJ, he was at least working.

And the Hairy Cornflake could still lay claim to playing a key role in a golden era of British broadcasting, a time of family programmes, an age we still like to describe as innocent.
