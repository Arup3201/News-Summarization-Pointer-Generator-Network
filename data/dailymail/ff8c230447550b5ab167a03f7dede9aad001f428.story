David Cameron has fuelled speculation that Wimbledon champion Andy Murray will be awarded a knighthood, saying: 'I can’t think of anyone who deserves one more.'

The Prime Minister, who watched Murray become the first British player to win Wimbledon since 1936, said that the tennis star had 'lifted the spirits of the whole country'.

Downing Street sources indicated last 
the Government would pass Murray's name to the Honours Committee because he 
had matched the achievement of cyclist Bradley Wiggins, who was knighted
for winning the Tour de France – Britain’s first victory in the event’s
100-year history.

Delight: Andy Murray is interviewed today after his dramatic straight sets win over Novak Djokovic on Centre Court yesterday

Murray beat Serbian world Number One Novak Djokovic on Centre Court yesterday 6-4 7-5 6-4 in sweltering conditions to end the country's 77-year wait for a homegrown male winner.

The 26-year-old said that he wasn't sure he deserved to become 'Sir Andy' but he admitted the title would be a 'nice thing to have'.

Murray was awarded an OBE in the New 
Year’s honours list for services to tennis after he won Olympic gold and
triumphed at the US Open last October.

It
is usual for public figures to wait for four years before being given a
higher honour. But senior government sources said that was ‘not a hard 
and fast rule’.

Honour: Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured today on This Morning, was asked if Andy Murray should receive a knighthood and he replied: 'I can't think of anyone who deserves one more'

Cameron, who watched the final from the Royal Box, said: 'It was a fantastic day for Andy Murray, for British tennis and for Britain.

'I think he lifted the spirits of the whole country. We were wondering yesterday morning "Do we dare to dream that this is possible?" and he proved absolutely that it was.'

Questioned about whether he deserved a knighthood, Murray said: 'I think it’s a nice thing to have or be offered.

'“I think just because everyone’s waited for such a long time for this, 
that’s probably why it’ll be suggested, but I don’t know if it merits 
that. I don’t know.'

The Queen sent a private message of congratulations to the triumphant Scot yesterday after his Wimbledon win.

A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: ‘I 
can confirm that the Queen has sent a private message to Andy Murray 
following his Wimbledon victory.’

Sources close to Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, another keen tennis player, said he would also back a knighthood.

A senior No 10 source said: ‘This is a major achievement. It’s the first British win for 77 years.

‘If
you look at what happened with Bradley Wiggins, it’s a fairly safe bet 
that Andy Murray is going to be recommended for a knighthood.’

Andy
Roddick, former world tennis No 1, tweeted: ‘Pretty sure @andy_murray 
might have to change his twitter name to @sirandymurray . . . Well 
played and deserved!’

The
nomination will be passed to the Sports Honours Committee, which give 
its recommendations to the main Honours Committee, chaired by Sir Bob 
Kerslake, the head of the civil service.
