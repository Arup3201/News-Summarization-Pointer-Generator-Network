Hill ponies are being shot with contraceptive darts to stop them overbreeding on Dartmoor in a battle to save their existence.

Conservationist Charlotte Faulkner has been roaming moorland in the Devon national park firing doses into the hides of mares using a gas powered rifle.

The unusual move to dose 300 of the ponies is the latest attempt to control growing numbers.

Ms Faulkner, founder of the Dartmoor Hill Pony Association, is quick to point out that all owners must give permission and the horses hardly feel a thing.

'They just bounce forward and carry on eating, as if they had just had a bee sting,' she told the Exeter Express and Echo.

'Everything is about making it the very best as we can do it and it seems to be working very well.

'At the moment there is a problem – we need the ponies to look after the habitat but the by-product of that is foals – we need the stallion to keep the mares in the right place and this is the end result.

'We now have about 100 on this drug but we won't know the final result of the trial until May.'

Each gas-fired dart contains a dose of the drug Improvac, a much cheaper and longer-lasting way to prevent mares becoming pregnant than the old system of injections.

'The gun has been brought over from America and uses an infra-red beam to judge the distance so you don't overshoot or hit them too powerfully – their welfare has been really carefully worked out.'

Once the pony has been dosed a sharp-eyed assistant needs to retrieve the tiny dart. 

Ms Faulkner has previously spoken out in favour of eating ponies to save their species, saying a meat trade should improve a pony's chances of finding a new home.

'Strangely, having a meat trade should improve a pony's chances of finding a new home at sales,' she wrote in a letter to South West Equine Protection (SWEP),

The numbers of hill ponies have declined from over 25,000 in the 1930s to around 1,000 today

The native ponies – not to be confused with their pure-bred Dartmoor cousins – are an essential part of the ecology of the national park by keeping the gorse on the moorland under control.

But their numbers have declined from over 25,000 in the 1930s to around 1,000 today.

With ponies selling for as little as £10 at auction, they have been left to breed unchecked and there are now fears of overpopulation.

In 2013 it emerged that unwanted Dartmoor ponies were being slaughtered and fed to lions and tigers in zoos and their hides were being crafted into 'wild pony' drums.

Ms Faulkner said she believes herders will only continue to keep the animals if there is a 'sustainable market' for them. 

The tails of the ponies shot with contraceptive darts are trimmed back to mark them out in the autumn.

The initiative has been backed by Exmoor Pony Society and the Exmoor National Park Authority.
