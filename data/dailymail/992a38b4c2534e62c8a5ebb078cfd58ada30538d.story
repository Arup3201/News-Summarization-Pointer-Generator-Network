A former National Farmers' Union chairman has been arrested and quizzed by police over an alleged cannabis farm.

John Shears, 69, of Lower Nattadon, Chagford, Devon was said to be among four men quizzed after a drugs raid on barns and outbuildings.

He is an unelected member of Dartmoor National Park Authority's Development Management Committee based at its headquarters in Bovey Tracey and a prominent farmer in the area.

Police, who have not confirmed the identity of those detained, revealed that 189 large cannabis plants with a street value of £75,000 were taken away from an apparent drugs factory near Chagford on Thursday last week.

Others questioned by officers at Launceston Police Station, Cornwall, after the swoop were a 25-year-old man from Kingsteignton, a 49-year-old man from the Chagford area and a 34-year-old man from Cullompton.

All four were later released on police bail pending further inquiries, including analysis of the plants and growing equipment seized from the farm buildings.

It is understood police hired a large vehicle to take away what they described as a 'significant' haul.

Dartmoor National Park Authority confirmed it was reviewing Mr Shear's status as a member while the police investigation continued.

A spokesman said: 'This matter is part of a police investigation. He is assisting police with their enquiries.

'We are reviewing his status as an authority member pending the outcome of the investigation.'

West Devon police sector commander Insp Andy Oliver said: 'All those questioned were arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the production and supply of cannabis.

'Some 189 plants were taken away. They had an estimated street value of £74,800. This was a big operation.'

He added: 'It was a significant find and comes on the back of one just a few weeks before in Okehampton where drugs and cash seized were valued at £100,000.'

He said all four men would be questioned again by officers in August.

A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall police said: 'A warrant was executed at a rural property in Chagford around 9.20am on May 7.

'Officers seized more than 100 suspected cannabis plants and suspected drugs equipment.

'Four men arrested on suspicion of production of Class B drugs. Aged 41, 34, 69 and 25 and from Chagford. All four taken into custody at Launceston and bailed until August 7.'

Growing cannabis can attract a substantial prison sentence depending on the offender's role in the crime.

Mr Shears has been an active member of the National Farmers' Union where he has served as a chairman and vice-chairman.

He is also chairman of Chagford Commoners' Association.
