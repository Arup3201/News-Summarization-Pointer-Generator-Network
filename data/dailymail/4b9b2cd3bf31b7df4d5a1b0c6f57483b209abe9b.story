Charles joked with Indian actress Rani Mukerji, a top Bollywood star who glittered in a stunning gold sari. 

Meanwhile, Camilla more than held her own against such a backdrop of such sparkling glamour in a stunning diamond serpent necklace, matching bracelet and large amethyst and diamond drop earrings.

The Duchess's necklace, which consists of round and square-cut diamonds in a platinum frame, with two tiny rubies for eyes, is thought to be a wedding gift from Charles.

Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall also greeted children's rights advocate Kailash Satyarthi, Coronation Street star Sair Khan and Bend It Like Beckham director Gurinder Chadha.

The royals joined the 300 guests who were treated to performances by Former X Factor contestant and Ghost singer Ella Henderson and stand-up comedian Romesh Raganathan.

Charles was also joined by celebrity guests including X Factor supremo Simon Cowell and one of the show's judges Louis Walsh.

The British Asian Trust operates in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka  to end abuse and exploitation, as well as improve education, healthcare and livelihoods in impoverished areas.

The  event this year marked the launch of a new anti-trafficking fund for India supporting the work the Trust has undertaken in support of at risk girls affected by abuse and exploitation.

India is home to almost half of the world's trafficked population, according to royalcentral.co.uk, and the British Asian Trust has supported many programmes to embolden young, vulnerable girls, to take back their lives, including many who trafficked in the past.

The inaugural event in 2014 raised more than £500,000 to support grass-roots programmes across South Asia. 

The British Asian Trust Ambassador, Nihal Arthanayake hosted the evening festivities while Chelsea footballer Cesc Fàbregas, Shahid Khan (aka Naughty Boy) and Goodness Gracious Me comedian Sanjeev Bhaskar OBE were also there.  

While many stunning dresses were worn, Camilla's lavish diamond serpent necklace kept her in the spotlight

The pair may have swapped baby news as Holly's daughter Luka is 14 months old and Lauren is mother to Eric who celebrates his first birthday on 14 February.

Meanwhile, Charles talked and laughed with former BBC and ITV newsreader Tasmin Lucia-Khan, who looked stunning in an outfit that looked both sexy and modest.

Wearing a high-necked gown with sheer sleeves and a cut-out neckline, Tasmin wore a diamond and gold forehead pendant and a jewelled cummerbund that showed off her slim waist.

Prince Charles, who is President of the British Asian Trust, started the charity after he was moved  by the poverty he witnessed in South Asia
