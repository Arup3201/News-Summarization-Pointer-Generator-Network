On trial: Cody Legebokoff, 24, allegedly killed 3 women and a teenager between 2009 and 2010

An alleged serial killer told Canadian authorities who had pulled over his vehicle that he was covered in blood because he had just clubbed a deer to death, it has emerged.

But Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers knew there was more to the story when they stopped Cody Legebokoff, 24, for speeding on a rural road near Prince George, British Columbia.

He is now on trial for the murders of Loren Leslie, 15, Jill Stuchenko, 35, Cynthia Maas, 35, and Natasha Montgomery, 23, who all died in 2009 or 2010.

Legebokoff had allegedly just killed Leslie, whom he met after they chatted online, when he was pulled over on a quiet stretch of highway on November 27, 2010, the National Post reported.

RCMP Constable Aaron Kehler, who was just a rookie at the time, had spotted the truck speeding through a forest and thought it was strange when the vehicle didn't slow down when it hit the highway.

He guessed that the driver was speeding so signaled for him to stop and waited for another officer, K.P. Sidhu, to meet him. The two constables had been about to meet to exchange a lost purse.

When they approached the vehicle, Legebokoff had blood smears on his face and chin, blood on his legs and a pool of 
blood on the driver's mat. But it was an open beer can that allowed the constables to conduct a thorough search of the truck under the Liquor Control Licence Act, the Post reported.

Loss: Loren Leslie, 15, was found killed near to a rural road where Legebokoff was pulled over by suspicious police officers in November 2010. They found him with blood on his face and legs

Inside they found a multi-tool and a wrench covered in blood. Legebokoff claimed that he had been poaching - but the constable asked why the items were covered in blood.

'He said they took turns clubbing it [the alleged deer] to death,' Kehler told the court.

When Kehler asked Legebokoff if he did much poaching, he replied: 'Yeah, I'm a redneck. Thatâ€™s what we do for fun.'

Inside the vehicle, they also allegedly found a monkey backpack on the passenger seat, a wallet containing a children's hospital card with Leslie's name on and bottles of drinks favored by teen girls.

'I told him I was looking for the truth of what was going on,' Kehler told the court.

Victims: Leslie, left, was his youngest alleged victim at age 15. After her body was discovered, Legebokoff, was allegedly connected by DNA evidence to the death of 35-year-old mother Cynthia Maas, right

Killed: He also allegedly killed 35-year-old Jill Stuchenko, left, and Natasha Montgomery, 23, right. Montgomery's body has never been found but her DNA was allegedly found on items in Legebokoff's apartment

'From the things I've learned, people who enjoy killing animals, taking turns clubbing a deer - I said that sometimes they could turn out to be serial killers.'

Mr. 
Legebokoff was arrested under the Wildlife Act for poaching but Kehler 
also requested a conservation officer to check the area for signs of 
poaching - and Leslie's body was found.

'I asked (the conservation officer) if it was what we expected or if everything is OK,' Kehler said. 'He replied back to me: "It's worst-case scenario".'

Leslie's body was partially buried near a gravel pit close to the road with her pants pulled down. While there was no signs of life, she was still warm to the touch, the court heard.

Legebokoff was charged with her murder.

'Immediately after the charter warning, Mr. Legebokoff turned to me and said, "I found her like that",' Kehler said.

He was later allegedly linked to the 
deaths of the three other women. Montgomery's body was 
never found but items in his home, including sheets and her clothes, allegedly had 
evidence of her DNA.

'Evidence': Constables allegedly found blood-covered tools in his truck, pictured, but he claimed the blood was from beating a deer to death as he poached. Authorities also allegedly found Leslie's backpack inside

All
 three adults had been cocaine users and involved in the sex trade, the court heard.

Legebokoff allegedly met Leslie in November 2010 after exchanging text messages and talking on the social media site Nexopia and arranging to buy alcohol, the Post reported.

He initially claimed they had met each other by accident and agreed to have sex - but he later changed his story and claimed she became agitated and started stabbing herself, so he struck her to put her out of her misery.

His trial is expected to last six to eight months. Legebokoff has pleaded not guilty.

Loren Leslie's family have launched a foundation in her name that aims to spread her intention of treating others with dignity and respect. For more information, visit their website.
