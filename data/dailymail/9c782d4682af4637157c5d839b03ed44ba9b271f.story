Stephen Hodson accomplished a huge weight loss achievement when he shed an impressive 16 stone in just 18 months.

But instead of celebrating his weight loss success, the 32-year-old virgin has been left feeling insecure and unattractive after the weight loss has left with huge flaps of skin all over his body.

Blaming his saggy skin for his unlucky love life, Stephen is desperate to make drastic changes.

Stephen Hodson lost a remarkable 16 stone in just 18 months but is still unlucky in love after he has been left with handfuls of skin flaps

Stephen, who consumed a stomach-churning 6,000 calories a day, decided to go on a diet in order to find love

The NHS clinical auditor decided to take control of his weight after tipping the scales at 30 stone 12lbs with a whopping 68in waistline after years of gorging on takeaways and beer.

He consumed a stomach-churning 6,000 calories a day but decided to go on a diet in order to find love.

Stephen even hired a personal trainer after he got stuck in a caravan while on holiday in August 2010.

After 18 months eating just 1,200 calories a day and exercising for up to two hours a day he now weighs a svelte 14st 10lbs and has a size 38in waist.

But Stephen, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs., says he is still scared to go on a date in case his saggy skin repels women and still has to wear extra-baggy clothes in order to hide his unsightly skin.

He said: 'From an appearance point of view it’s just as embarrassing to have the loose skin as it was being 30 stone.

'People don’t point in the street like they used to but I know it is under my clothes and it affects my confidence. It’s heavy and uncomfortable and when I am naked the skin hangs down over my genitalia.

Stephen survived on just 1,200 calories a day for 18 months

'I lost the weight because I wanted to find Miss Right and to feel healthier but I’m afraid that if I did pull I’d put them off because of my saggy body.

The saggy skin caused by the weight loss has made Stephen shy and the thought of taking his shirt off fills him with fear, especially when on holiday with his friends.

Sometimes he even has to tuck it in which he finds wholly embarrassing.

Stephen, who works at University Hospital North Staffordshire, was twice turned down for a £10,000 operation to have the excess skin removed.

But after losing even more weight, the NHS changed their decision and he will go under the knife to remove the skin from his chest, stomach, groin, arms and legs in August.

Despite his huge weight loss, he is still too embarrassed to take his top of because of his flappy skin

Stephen hopes that surgery to remove the excess skin with help his love life

He originally applied to have the operation done when he was 18 stone after his doctor told him he needed to take action but the NHS board twice refused his application.

Luckily for Stephen, this year they decided he met the criteria.

'One of the reasons was because I had lost over half my body weight and the other was that my BMI was still above the level it should be for a man of my current weight.

'What they do is they cut across your abdomen and they roll it out. It sounds really crude but they just cut it off.

'And they have to take my belly button and nipples off and then re-position them and sew them back on.

'I won’t have a body ready to show off this summer but I’ll hopefully look good in time for the Christmas party season.

'I just can’t wait to start dating. I just hope women find me attractive,' he says.

After the operation, Stephen is expected to weigh just 13-and-a-half stone.
