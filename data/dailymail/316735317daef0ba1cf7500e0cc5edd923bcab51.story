Managing money better, getting fit and spending more time with friends and family are top of the list of resolutions for the New Year.

With changes to the retirement age recently announced nearly four out of ten adults (37 per cent) have pledged to sort out their finances, particularly focusing on their retirement income.

Forty eight per cent of those questioned for a poll said they aimed to improve their fitness and health this year, while 43 per cent promised to spend time with family and friends.

Meanwhile 17.6 per cent want to learn a new skill.

The OnePoll survey, carried out for pensions provider Friends Life, also found that nearly a third of those questioned (32 per cent) are more confident about their finances at the beginning of 2014 than a year ago, while 27 per cent are less confident

TV presenter Julia Bradbury, who hosts the BBC's Countryfile, is among those forced to look again at what pension she might expect.

Julia, who is 43 and could work until she is 67 or more, has a two-year-old son with partner Gerard Cunningham and homes in Rutland and West London.

She said yesterday: 'Even though I am only in my early 40s, my resolution this year is to carefully review my pension arrangements in light of the increased working age.

'I want to ensure that my pension is fit for purpose in 30 years' time.'

Another well-known figure, leading rugby player Richard Hill, has also made a New Year pledge to take advice about his retirement income.

The former Lions legend, who won 71 caps playing with his country and also played for Saracens, will be 41 in May.

Gym memberships, diet books, juicing machines, vitamin pills, lotions and potions and unflattering items of Lycra-heavy clothing all add up to an expensive set of new year's resolutions

He said: 'Retiring from the game brought home to me how important it was that I sought professional advice for my future career.

'My New Year's resolution is to work with my financial adviser to give me the freedom to pursue my passion for sport in retirement.'

The OnePoll survey, carried out for pensions provider Friends Life, also found that nearly a third of Britons (32 per cent) are more confident about their finances at the dawn of 2014 than a year ago, while 27 per cent are less confident.

David Still, managing director for retirement income at Friends Life, said: 'It is clear to see that many of us are feeling more hopeful about the year ahead and are resolved to fix our finances while the going is good.'

Researchers, who questioned 1,071 women and 929 men, also uncovered a great deal of ignorance about financial planning among the 27 per cent who are less confident.

Only 33 per cent of this group understood the word 'annuity' and just 23 per cent 'enhanced annuity.'

Only 25 per cent of this group would trust a financial adviser, although 32 per cent would probably take advice from family or friends.
