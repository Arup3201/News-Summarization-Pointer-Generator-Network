A lorry driver has thought of a novel way to keep his beloved dog safe at work - making her wear a Hi-Vis jacket.

Trucker Sam Bloor, 58, has taken 10-year-old Tilly to work every day for the past year to keep him company on long drives up and down the country.

And although she rarely leaves the cab of the lorry, Mr Bloor makes the cross breed West Highland Terrier wear a tiny high-visibility jacket while at work - just in case.

Safety first! 10-year-old Tilly the dog wears her Hi-Vis jacket to work everyday

Standing out: Although Tilly, a cross-breed West Highland Terrier, rarely leaves the cab of the lorry Mr Bloor likes to make sure she is safe by wearing her jacket

Mr Bloor, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, says Tilly usually sits in the passenger seat looking out of the window as he delivers bricks and concrete.

He says she is great company for his 12-hour shifts, and he couldn't imagine life on the road without her.

Speaking on Thursday, Mr Bloor said: 'I put her jacket on at 6am, she looks quite funny in it but she needs it for health and safety reasons, and then we both jump in the lorry and off we go until 6pm that evening.

'I have to take Tilly to work with me as I am single and have no one to look after her at home - but I love it.

'People love her, she’s so friendly and she loves the ride, she doesn’t go to sleep, she is quite a nosy dog so sticks her head out the window most of the time.

'Obviously on some days we hit a bit of traffic and if we pull up alongside a family with kids, they love her and she loves them, she’s just so friendly and great company.

Man's best friend: Mr Bloor says Tilly certainly turns heads in her jacket

'We’re together for 24 hours a day, we’re best mates, she is just like a child to me and is like a mascot for the firm.

'I’ve had her since she was born, I bred her, so we have a strong bond.

'But she isn’t just a delight to be with when she’s with me, all the guys at work love her too.

'She’s friendly to everyone and is just a ball of life.'

Terry Adnams, 54, the company director at CMR Demolition LTD, where Sam works said that the animal has proved a popular addition to the team.

He said: “Tilly is a very pleasant and small dog.

Good company: Mr Bloor says Tilly, who usually sits in the passenger seat and watches out of the window on long drives, is great company on his shifts

'She is very friendly and goes everywhere with Sam, she sits in the passenger seat and stays there all day.

'She doesn’t leave the vehicle and she’s not allowed on the site for health and safety reasons.

“So she just looks out the window in her little high-vis jacket and people seem to respond in a nice way to her.

'It is unusual, but it brings a smile to people’s faces when they see her.

'Tilly has been here for around 12 months now, he has brought her along since virtually his first day of work.

'However, she is somewhat of an exception, if other workers started bringing in their dogs and other pets we would have to stop it.

'We understand the reason for Sam bringing Tilly to work and we are fine with that.'
