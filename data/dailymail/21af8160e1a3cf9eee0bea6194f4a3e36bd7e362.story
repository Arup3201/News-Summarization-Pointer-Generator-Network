Labour's big beasts were last night at war over Ed Miliband’s controversial election campaign tactics.

Lord Prescott reacted with fury after two former Cabinet colleagues questioned their leader’s relentless focus on the health service, rather than the economic legacy of New Labour.

The former deputy prime minister branded John Hutton and Alan Milburn ‘Tory collaborators’.

And Mr Miliband came under further pressure over claims that he said privately he is aiming to ‘weaponise’ the NHS as a campaign tool.

Controversy: Lord Hutton and Mr Milburn had questioned Ed Miliband's relentless focus on the health service

Lord Hutton and Mr Milburn, two senior Blairites, yesterday accused the Labour leader and Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls of failing to defend the economic record of the last Labour government.

‘They have worked harder to distance themselves from New Labour than to defend its record,’ the two former ministers said in a joint article for the Financial Times.

‘This hands the Tories a needless advantage. If Labour is to win in May, the two Eds need to set the record straight and reclaim ground foolishly bequeathed to their opponents.’

On Tuesday – the day of a big NHS campaign launch by Mr Miliband and shadow health secretary Andy Burnham – Mr Milburn warned Labour was making a fatal mistake if it positioned itself as the party that would put more money into the health service, without saying how it would introduce further reforms.

‘You’ve got a pale imitation actually of the 1992 general election campaign. Maybe it will have the same outcome, I don’t know,’ he added.

And Lord Hutton said: ‘We should avoid a re-run [of 1992]. We can win the next election, we ought to win the next election. But we shouldn’t imagine that there aren’t some really difficult, hard choices to be made, not just about the economy, but also about the future shape of public services.

‘Labour has got to talk about the economy and have a message about what it will do to keep the economy moving ahead.’

Yesterday Lord Prescott raged: ‘I see those Tory collaborators Milburn and Hutton are attacking Labour’s brilliant NHS plan.’

In a reference to consultancy jobs undertaken by the pair since leaving office, the former deputy prime minister added: ‘Go back to advising Pepsi and the nuclear industry.’

But even some shadow ministers fear Labour is losing the battle on the economy – with latest figures showing the UK is now pole position to be the strongest growing country in the developed world.

Labour’s plans suffered a further blow as Tony Blair’s former senior adviser on health warned its plans to use a mansion tax on expensive homes to fund more NHS staff would take two years to come fully on stream. 

Professor Paul Corrigan also claimed Mr Burnham is planning his own ‘top-down re-organisation’ by shifting responsibility for commissioning NHS services to ‘health and well-being boards’.

Mr Burnham insisted Professor Corrigan had ‘misunderstood’ his proposals. In a bruising interview with BBC Newsnight, Mr Burnham came under pressure over Labour’s claim that the use of private sector firms to provide free NHS services would mean ‘the end of the health service as we know it’.

He was confronted by official figures showing less than six per cent of the NHS budget is outsourced to private and not-for-profit sectors – a small rise on the 4.4 per cent that involved such providers under Labour. 

He repeatedly refused to say by how much Labour intended to reduce the involvement of alternative providers for free care if the party returns to power.

The interventions by senior Blairites are said to be part of campaign to prevent Mr Burnham becoming Labour leader if Mr Miliband loses the election and is ousted.

In the Commons, Mr Miliband insisted the NHS was in ‘crisis’, despite figures from the British Social Attitudes survey showing dissatisfaction with the health service is at a record low.

The Prime Minister said Mr Miliband was ‘in a desperate mess’ over the NHS and said Labour had wrecked services in Wales, where it is in government.

He repeatedly called on the Labour leader to withdraw ‘disgraceful’ remarks he reportedly made in a briefing to BBC executives about ‘weaponising’ the NHS as an election issue. 

Labour’s health plans include bringing in an extra 20,000 nurses and 8,000 GPs, as well as guaranteeing GP appointments in 48 hours.
