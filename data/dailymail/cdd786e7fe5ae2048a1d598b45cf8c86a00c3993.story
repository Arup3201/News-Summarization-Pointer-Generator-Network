An assistant principal has resigned after a former student that she allegedly molested 15 years ago confronted her in a phone call before posting the conversation online.

Jamie Carrillo posted a YouTube video last Friday where she can be seen calling her alleged teacher rapist Andrea Cardosa at her office in Alhambra Unified School district in California where she was currently working.

The now 28-year-old mother said that she made the video post as the statute of limitations has run out for her to be able to prosecute and that she didn't want Cardosa around other children.

Andrea Cardosa has been accused by a former student of sexually abusing her when she was 12 years old

Jamie Carrillo confronted a teacher on the phone last week whom she alleges sexually abused her when she was 12 years old. She said that she did so as she did not want the woman, who is still a teacher, around other children

In the call, she tells the woman, who identifies herself as Andrea Cardosa, that she did something terribly wrong at Chemawa Middle School in Riverside 15 years ago. Cardosa replies: 'Yes, and I regret it.'

Ms
 Carrillo then asks what the woman would do if a student told her that 
she was having a sexual relationship with a teacher to which she replies
 that she would involve law enforcement.

She asks: 'So how is that any different from what you did when I was at Chemawa Middle?'

To which the alleged molester answers: 'It's not.'

Ms
 Carrillo goes on to tell her alleged attacker that she has children of 
her own and that her former teacher's actions ruined her life and that 
she is 'disgusting'.

When she hangs up the phone, Ms Carrillo shows that she made the call on the screen and reads out the number. She says: 'And I’m shaking like a leaf... not even an ''I'm sorry.'' Or anything. Just that she regrets it.'

Ms Carrillo said that the teacher (pictured right) took her on out of town trips and made her feel 'special'

Alhambra Unified School District 
Superintendent Laura Tellez-Gagliano released a statement saying the 
YouTube link was emailed to the school and they passed it to the 
Alhambra Police Department.

Cardosa, who was named by Ms Carrillo in the tape now seen 300,000 times, has stepped down from her job. She had worked at the school for four months, according to officials.

Ms Carrillo's lawyer questioned whether Chemawa Middle School investigated Cardosa who reportedly met the young girl when she coached her at basketball.

Ms Carrillo alleges that the coach kissed her in the locker room and put her hand down the 12 year old's pants.

The former student then claims Cardosa, who is believed to have been in her mid-twenties at the time of the alleged assaults, organized out of town trips so that she could have sex with the underage girl.

The 28-year-old alleges that her former teacher abused her when she was a student at a California high school

Ms Carrillo alleges that she was just 12 years old and a player on the school basketball team when the abuse started

At
 a press conference on Monday, Ms Carrillo said that she expected others
 who had allegedly been abused by the teacher to come forward.

The 28-year-old told KTLA: 'Everything was stolen from me. She just completely manipulated me into thinking that I needed her and I wanted it.'

Alhambra Police Department have investigated but said there were no victims or crimes reported at Cardosa's new school.

The case has now been forwarded to police investigators in the school district where the alleged crimes took place.
