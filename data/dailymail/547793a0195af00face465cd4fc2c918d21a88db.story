The thoughtful parents of twin boys who brought sweets, ear plugs and a kind note for the people on their cross country plane trip today explained why they went to such great lengths to appease their fellow passengers.

Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, Christina Diaz, 38, and Michael Rubinstein, 32, said the bemused travelers thought Ms Diaz was a flight attendant handing out on-board snacks when she distributed the 'apology' bags.

And, despite hours of hard work preparing the kits, their 14-week-old twins Arrow and Jasper didn't even let out a murmur throughout the five-hour flight from San Francisco to Washington, D.C.

Ms Diaz and Mr Rubinstein have detailed their first flight with their adorable baby boys as well as the new notoriety their simple act of kindness has earned them.

Generous: In an exclusive interview with the MailOnline, Ms Diaz and Mr Rubinstein spoke about their first flight with their adorable baby boys as well as the new notoriety their simple act of kindness has earned them.

Mr Rubinstein, 32, a geographic specialist for Google Earth, and Ms Diaz, 32, a photographer, live together in Berkley, California.

They were terrified of visiting Mr Rubinstein's family on the East Coast, nervous not only about the trip, but of what they would do if Arrow Wyatt and Jasper Caleb were fussy on the flight.

'I was really, really nervous about getting on the flight with them,' Ms Diaz told the MailOnline.

'There's always that stigma of getting on the plane with babies because people get annoyed if they're crying.'

She continued: 'We didn't want to encroach on people's personal space when they didn't have an option to go any where else.'

Then, she remembered having read about a new mother who brought gifts for the other passengers on her flight and decided to do the same.

With about $20, Ms Diaz went out to the store to pick up some candy and ear plugs.

She printed out sweet notes to explain to the flight that they were new parents and that they would do the best to keep Arrow and Jasper quiet during the journey from San Francisco to Washington D.C.

The two spread out the gift bag ingredients and got to work the night before the flight, rushing to finish them in time.

'She was working on them until midnight the night before,' Mr Rubinstein said. 'I was relegated to cutting up the little notes.'

'We're twin baby boys on our first flight and we're only 14 weeks old!

We'll
 try to be on our best behavior, but we'd like to apologize in advance 
just in case we lose our cool, get scared or our ears hurt.

Our mom and 
dad (AKA our portable milk machine and our diaper changer) have ear 
plugs available if you need them.'

'We're twin baby boys on our first flight and we're only 14 weeks old!' the note read.

'We'll

just in case we lose our cool, get scared or our ears hurt. Our mom and 
dad (AKA our portable milk machine and our diaper changer) have ear 
plugs available if you need them.'

The couple packed the 20 or so Ziploc bags in with the twins and headed for the airport.

They got through security without a problem as the TSA agent had twins himself, and understood their fears of traveling with the boys.

Once they settled in their back row, Ms Diaz got up and started passing around the packages, unsure how they might be received.

'People just took it thinking I was a flight attendant,' Ms Diaz said, 'and then a few minutes later, I guess they read it, and they started laughing.'

Mr Rubinstein said that though he was busy watching the twins, he did notice the passengers' attitudes change once they receive their gifts.

'There was a guy who I was eyeing that kept looking back seeing the babies and he didn't look too happy. After she gave him the candies, he would look back and smile,' Mr Rubinstein said. 'That was definitely one person who was moved by it.'

Mr Rubinstein said he also heard another passenger who was pleased by their generosity: Andrew Merritt, the man who posted the photograph of the goodie bag that was shared by millions of people.

'I overhead him say, "This is so cool I'm going to take a picture," Mr Rubinstein said.

And the karma definitely paid off: the boys miraculously stayed calm throughout the whole flight.

'It was still stressful,' Ms Diaz said. 'Until we landed, I was like, "I don't want to fly home!"'

When they arrived in Washington, D.C., Arrow and Jasper met their grandparents for the first time. The family spent the next few days swooning over the babies, completely unaware of their mounting fame.

Ms Diaz showed her sister-in-law a leftover package in passing and a few days later, her sister-in-law showed her the hundreds of articles the kind couple.

'At first we were a little incredulous,' Mr Rubinstein said. 'Then we spent the evening reading the comments.'

The pair are still on vacation with their family and have already begun making more goodie bags for their flight home on Saturday.

'It was met with such a warm response,' Ms Diaz said, still slightly afraid of the journey. 'Maybe it's a lucky charm.'

Thoughtful: Andrew Merritt received the package at the start of a journey to bike from Paris to Istanbul

Journey: Upon receiving the gift package, he 
said he was 'overwhelmed with a positive view on mankind’s potential'. 
He was also thrilled with his new notoriety on Reddit

'Brilliant and thoughtful parents handed these out to everyone on my flight,' Andrew Merritt wrote on Reddit, posting a picture of the Ziploc plastic bag filled with goodies and a note of explanation.

Mr Merritt, a San Francisco jack-of-all-trades, explained that the mini travelers and their parents ended up being absolutely delightful. 

'The parents were fantastic and the kids were better than would be expected. Mom was super nervous and obviously very tired, but still extremely nice to everyone around her. Not a mean or frustrated word from dad either. Saw them meeting his parents at baggage, who were seeing babies for first time, and got a bit teary,' Mr Merritt explained.

Mr Merritt's tale occurred at the start of a very personal journey, the Redditor said on his blog.

The 27-year-old from San Francisco just embarked on a bicycle trip from Paris to Istanbul after a bad break up.

'Last night I left San Francisco to begin my journey. I’ve left my job, home, and those closest to me to seek something I’m not sure I even understand at times,' he wrote.

'Once onboard, I realized that I was sitting in a row with not one 14 week old baby, but twins.'

Upon receiving the gift package, he said he was 'overwhelmed with a positive view on mankind’s potential'. He was also thrilled with his new notoriety on Reddit.

'I should also add that I submitted this photo on Reddit.com and it currently has more points that Barack Obama’s AMA (he came to the site last Wednesday). For those who are as addicted to Reddit as myself, this is quite a big deal,' he wrote.

The idea immediately sparked chatter on the social news site, garnering over 3,000 comments and one million views after it was posted over the weekend.

Most of the reaction was positive with one user calling it the 'most considerate thing I've ever seen ... it has fully restored my faith in said consideration.'
