I will not bow to pressure when picking my starting XI, was the gist of what Mauricio Pochettino said.

The Tottenham Hotspur manager is yet to opt for Harry Kane as a starting striker in the Premier League over Emmanuel Adebayor and Roberto Soldado, two players that earn significantly more but have contributed far less.

'My decision is always about my analysis on the training,' Pochettino insisted, asserting he rotates his strikers to give ‘balance to the team'.

It begs the question, what more must Kane do to earn his chance as Tottenham's go-to striker? The preferred duo at White Hart Lane have been AWOL or, at the very least, not justifying the fat pay packets they receive while Kane is paid a fraction of the cost.

And yet the club’s current top goalscorer is regularly relegated to the substitutes’ bench, having played just 95 minutes in six Premier League appearances so far.

Pochettino has been scratching his head over finding that ‘balance’ but the numbers tell it better. Kane this year has averaged a goal every 72.9 minutes, while Adebayor trails on 415.5 and Soldado, 300.

Sportsmail columnist and former Tottenham midfielder Jamie Redknapp believes Kane has earned the right, despite being relatively new. ‘If you compare him to Adebayor and Soldado there is no comparison,’ he told Sky Sports. ‘I’d be amazed if he doesn’t start next week (against Stoke City).’

Before that, though, the man eight years younger than Soldado and nine than Adebayor travels to Greece to face Asteras Tripolis in the Europa League on Thursday evening.

The Road to Warsaw is inviting to Kane. It has become the England Under 21 international’s stomping ground, scoring four goals in a competition that offers Champions League football to the winner.

Kane is poised to start in Tripolis as he did against the Greek club at White Hart Lane a fortnight ago, where he scored a hat-trick before replacing goalkeeper Hugo Lloris who was sent off.

Three days later he was dropped in favour of Adebayor as Tottenham lost 2-1 against Newcastle United at home.

The former Manchester City and Arsenal striker has not travelled for a Europa League tie in more than a year, and has been left in London again.

It implies Asteras will be another chance for the Tottenham youth product to give Pochettino food for thought.

And yet, will it hinder him? With Pochettino hellbent on rotation, Kane is poised to subsequently be overlooked for Sunday’s Premier League match against Stoke.

There’s no doubting the striker’s enthusiasm - ‘I feel fit and ready and I feel I could play a game every day if I could,’ he says - although Pochettino will suggest he’s protecting a Young Lion from being burned out.

Kane isn't the most technically gifted, nor is he the fastest or most skilful. But he has shown ability to gain half a yard on his opponent and be clinical in doing so, outshining £26million signing Soldado in the process.

Take, for example, the striker's latest appearance against strugglers Aston Villa on Sunday.

Such confidence saw the 21-year-old come on for Adebayor with Tottenham a goal down and dismiss Erik Lamela, a £30m buy, to take charge of an inviting free-kick in the dying moments.

The Argentina international wanted to take it, Kane was having none of it. He scored with technique more than power, albeit via a wicked deflection from Nathan Baker, and completed a 2-1 turnaround for Pochettino.

‘Without a doubt it was one of the greatest moments for me in a Spurs shirt,' man of the match Kane said afterwards.

Tottenham have stalled in the Premier League, leaving a top-four finish an ambitious ask.

For the first time, the Champions League awaits the winner of the Europa League and Kane, with Tottenham’s Greek obstacle looming, can continue to raise eyebrows - if given the opportunity.
