After reaching a low point in the 1980s, average attendances have been steadily on the rise since the induction of the Premier League in 1992.

A total of 13,944,100 fans attended 380 matches in the top flight last season, surpassing the previous Premier League record set in 2007-08.

Over 17 million fans watched 462 matches in the record-breaking 1949-50 season.

The top flight was reduced from 22 to 20 teams from 1988 until 1991, and then permanently from 1995.

The figures emerge despite increasing fans' protests against escalating ticket prices.

A Premier League spokesman told Sporting Intelligence: ‘Attendances are of the utmost importance to the Premier League.'
