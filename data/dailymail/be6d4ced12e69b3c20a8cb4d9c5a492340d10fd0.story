Recognize this man? Police are looking for the suspect who stole his date's phone and pretended to be her online

Some people handle rejection better than others but a man proved he wasn't one of them after his date with a  22-year-old student didn't go as planned so he stole her cell phone and hacked into her account.

'I'm available for threesomes,' wrote the bitter gentleman on his date's account after swiping her cell phone 'because she wouldn't go back to his Williamsburg apartment.'

The man, whose identity has not been disclosed, went as far as uploading photos on his date's account, reports The New York Post.

He also made sure to text his date's friends pretending to be her and allegedly said things like, 'I’m all right everyone, just a little drunk but I’m home now.'

The woman, a student at St. John's University in Queens, said her date began normally at a popular venue in Union Square.

'It started pretty well,' the 22-year-old single mother of one 2-year-old.

'We talked for two weeks before we met in person.'

The woman, who wished to remain anonymous, shared the gentleman's OKCupid photos with police who are now looking for the suspect.
