A New Zealand couple whose two-year-old triplets died in a horrific shopping mall blaze in Qatar last year told of their joy today following the birth of twins.

Jane and Martin Weekes announced the birth of twins Poppy and Parker, who were delivered by caesarean in Auckland just over a year since the terrible fire that claimed the triplets and 16 other people.

'We're very, very happy and very relieved that babies and mum are doing well,' Mr Weekes told the Dominion Post newspaper.

He said that while the twins were born
 through IVF just after 36 weeks and will not be leaving the hospital 
for 'a wee while', he and his wife were relieved that the twins were 
born healthy.

But he 
admitted that the arrival of Poppy and Parker would 'never fill the 
void' of the triplets they lost, Lillie, Jackson and Willsher, in the 
fire.

'The twins are just another addition to our family, 'said Mr Weekes at his Auckland home.

'The sad thing is that Lillie, Jackson and Willsher weren't there to greet them.

'They would have had enormous fun with their new brother and sister.'

Five people were sentenced to six years imprisonment following the fire at Doha's Villagio mall on May 28 last year.

All 19 victims were foreigners, including 13 children, four teachers and and two firefighters.

Investigators said that the fire that broke out next to the unlicensed Gympanzee nursery was caused by an electrical fault.

At
 the time Mr Weekes said he and his wife, who lived in Doha where he was
 working, mourned the loss of 'the sunshine in our world.'

'Tragically they left together after only two short years,' he said.

'A
 time that was lived to the full every day with us laughing, playing, 
waking us at all hours of the night and simply being the sunshine in our
 world.'Â 

After the five people were sentenced, Mr 
Weekes told the New Zealand Herald that he was relieved and grateful 
that people had been found accountable for the fire.

'I think it was not a verdict that any of us were contemplating,' he said. 'It's been such a dreadful, dreadful year we were just expecting the worst.

'So we are pleasantly surprised - if you ca say you are surprised and happy about the fact that people have been held accountable for the death of your children.'

Among those convicted were Sheikh Ali Bin Jassem al-Thani, a co-owner of the nursery from the ruling family and Qatar's ambassador to Belgium.

The rest of those found guilty included a second co-owner of the nursery and members of the mall's management.
