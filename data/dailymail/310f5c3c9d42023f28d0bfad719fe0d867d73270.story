There are those who love nothing more than the adrenaline rush of amusement park rides... and then there's this teenager.

During a visit to Orlando's Magical Midway Thrill Park, the man passes out three times during a one-minute ride on the Sling Shot.

In between fainting, the unnamed rider wakes up and screams in terror when he finds himself dangling 390 feet above the ground.

Not for the faint-hearted! A teen passes out on the Sling Shot ride at Magical Midway Thrill Park in Orlando

The whole traumatising episode is captured on video on the ride's camera.

At the start of the clip the boy, who is riding with his friend Jordan Van Schalkwyk, looks decidedly nervous as they prepare to be catapulted into the air at a g-force of 3-5Gs.

The ride promises to enable you to experience total weightlessness as you are flung into the air at breakneck speed - a feeling this guy does not appear to enjoy.

For thrillseekers: The ride catapults riders 390 feet into the air with a g-force of 3.5g

As they are catapulted, he screams and squeezes his eyes shut, before suddenly losing consciousness.

He is passed out for eight seconds before coming to and, seeing that he is suspended 390 feet in the air, screams in terror again before fainting for a second time.

His amused friend can be seen laughing and nudging his buddy trying to stir him.

'Dude, wake up': The young man faints three times in the minute-long ride

The frightened teen wakes, briefly passes out for a third time, and eventually manages to remain conscious.

Jordan, who posted the footage online, finds the experience hilarious, and comments that they have to buy the video so they can watch him passing out three times in a row.

He tells the ride operators: 'Three times, he passed out! Three times!' 

Far from a unique reaction, there are a handful of other viral videos on YouTube which show riders passing out multiple times on the Sling Shot ride.
