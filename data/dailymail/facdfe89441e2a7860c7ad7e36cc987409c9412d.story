MMA fighter Cody Gibson told a man to Google his name before being punched in the face and knocked to the ground at a Las Vegas bar. 

The 27-year-old, nicknamed 'The Renegade', was captured on video in an altercation with another man, wagging his fists after the man had pushed him to the floor.

Gibson had already lost a fight that night, to Manny Gamburyan at UFC 178, and he found himself on the floor again after saying: 'Google me, b****'.

Age: 27 Nickname: The Renegade

From: Blackwell, Oklahoma, USA 

Height: 5ft 10in Weight: 135lbs

Record: 12 wins, five defeats

He was caught with a right hook before attempting to lift the assailant to the floor. 

The two grappled but the fight was broken up before the situation got out of hand and Gibson had a chance to use full force.

Gibson spoke of his regret about the incident the next day on Sherdog Radio. 

He said: 'When I woke up this morning, I definitely had that pit in the bottom of my stomach, like, "Holy c***. Could I be that guy?" You know, who gets fired over some stupid stuff. 

Gibson was floored, but then got up and lifted the man from the floor and took him down

A few onlookers got involved before the fight was broken up before any real damage was done

'This guy was being a typical kind of bro and started saying some stuff to me. At first, I told him I did not want to fight, two or three times. 

'He was definitely egging on the situation, and then he started to irritate me,' said Gibson, who said he was intoxicated. 

'Then I told him who I was, which was probably the worst idea, because then, after that, I feel like he really wanted to fight.'
