A young deaf woman was refused a job interview at a Darwin catering company after a staff member turned her away because she couldn't 'speak English'.

Miranda Reardon has now lodged a formal complaint with the Northern Territory Anti-Discrimination Commission after she felt disappointed with the way she was treated. 

When she arrived at the office, she met with an interviewer named 'Angela' but was knocked back when Ms Reardon asked if she could write down what she was saying.

The 20-year-old told Daily Mail Australia that the company had invited her to an interview after receiving her CV but when she got there, she didn't get a chance to be interviewed.

'I introduced myself to Angela by writing on a piece of paper but she shook her head and said something,’ Ms Reardon said.

'I asked her to write down what she was saying. I even told her that the team and I can find ways to communicate with each other.

But the staff responded by writing: 'Staff need to be able to tell you what to do. No time to write notes.’

'I felt like an immigrant who can’t speak English. I am deaf but I didn't ask for it - to be discriminated,’ Ms Reardon said.

The interviewer told Ms Reardon: 'I need someone who can speak English to communicate with other staff'

'She didn't even ask me questions or give me any chance to be interviewed and I felt really upset so I left the office.

'This is blatant discrimination and I have never experienced anything like it in the past.’

Ms Reardon, who recently moved up from Melbourne with her partner said she has over a year of experiences working in a fast paced kitchen, hospitality and food handling.

'I work in a busy inner Melbourne local café, cooking breakfast for customers every Saturday morning and we've all got on fine without communication issues. I even have a certificate in Hospitality II.

After hearing about a position that was vacant in the kitchen, she was invited to attend a formal interview in Woolner of Northern Territory after exchanging emails with the company.

'It’s difficult for deaf people to find a job even if they have applied for so many jobs and still get no answers.

'It’s ashamed that the company couldn't see my skills and knowledge because they refused to interview a deaf person or a non-English speaking people.

'It’s not about whether I can hear or speak but it’s about what I can do.’

Ms Reardon said the company sent her an email to apologise after the interview.

'She didn't mention my qualification or skills but she stated how communication between staff is so important – Her apology was not good enough and I haven’t replied.

'They never mentioned what qualifications and skills the staff needed to be able to work there either.

'But what I don’t understand is, let’s say my skills and qualifications weren’t good enough – why did they approach me for an interview in the first place?’

'It’s disappointing to see it still happening today when it should not have happened at all.

Ms Reardon said that when hiring people, their abilities should be looked at, not their disability.

'I don’t think there is enough awareness of deafness or resources for deaf people in Darwin,' she said

JebFab Catering Services owner Mitchell Smart told NT News that Ms Reardon had stormed out of the interview, frustrated at the inability to communicate with the interviewer. He said she also did not have the necessary skills for the position.
