Floyd Mayweather's potential blockbuster fight with Manny Pacquiao is not likely to happen, according to rapper Curtis Jackson, better known as 50 Cent.

A mega-fight between unbeaten Mayweather and eight-division champion Pacquiao had appeared to be edging closer with May 2015 being touted as a potential date.

But 50 Cent, who previously worked with the pound-for-pound king as a business partner in Mayweather Promotions before the pair had a falling out, has doubts that the fight will take place.

'I don't see him taking that fight, I don't. I know Floyd and I know [that he feels] he doesn't have to,' the rapper told boxingscene.com.

'He knows that no matter how they feel, they will watch the next one and he'll leave when he's ready to leave boxing on top.'

'A lot of the choices he makes are collective, it's not just him - it's his whole team. But when I get mad I blame it on him, I say it was him.'
