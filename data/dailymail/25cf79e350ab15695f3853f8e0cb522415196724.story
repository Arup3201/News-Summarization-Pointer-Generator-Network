Wayne Rooney's father was arrested yesterday by police investigating a football betting scam.

The officers, who swooped at dawn on 
the £450,000 home of Wayne Snr, also arrested the England striker's 
uncle, Richie. They are probing a rash of suspicious bets placed on a 
sending-off.

The investigation centres on the red card given to Motherwell's Steve Jennings in a match against Hearts last December.

The former Tranmere Rovers player, who hails from Kirkby, near Liverpool, was arrested at his home in Scotland.

The investigation comes at a bad time
for Rooney, who has been working to clean up his image following 
damaging revelations about his private life.

It emerged that the £180,000-a-week Manchester United star had slept with prostitutes while his wife, Coleen, was pregnant.

He is currently in Montenegro with 
the England team for today's Euro 2012 qualifier. Team manager Fabio 
Capello insisted Rooney had not been upset by his father's arrest.

'I found him relaxed and calm,' 
Capello said. 'There is no problem for the game, he will play against 
Montenegro. He told me there are no problems.'

But Rooney's estranged cousin Stephen, 27, a homosexual and cross dresser, said the arrests were 'embarrassing'.

'It's hysterical, but I'm quite 
surprised it's just the two,' he said. 'And they have the cheek to tell 
me that putting a dress on is embarrassing for the family.'

A spokesman for Merseyside Police 
confirmed nine men, aged between 22 and 68, had been arrested in 
Liverpool and Glasgow on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud as part of a
joint operation with the Gambling Commission into suspicious betting.

There was no sign yesterday of 
unemployed Wayne Snr, a 48-year-old former boxer, at the home he shares 
with Rooney's mother, Jeanette, in West Derby, Liverpool.

Anthony Barnfather, the lawyer 
representing him, said: 'Mr Rooney vigorously denies all of these 
allegations. We are co-operating fully with the investigation. No 
further comment will be made at this time.'

Neighbours at 54-year-old Richie 
Rooney's home, in Croxteth, Liverpool, confirmed a police car had been 
parked outside the modest semi in the early hours. He refused to comment
when he returned home on bail yesterday afternoon.

Members of the Press soon arrived outside the house of Wayne Rooney snr this afternoon

He spent 20 minutes inside before 
being driven off in a Ford Focus by his daughter, Claire. One visitor, 
who described himself as a member of the family, said: 'He doesn't know 
anything about all this.'

England captain John Terry, who has 
experienced media attention on his own family, also backed Rooney. 
'Wayne is focused on the game tomorrow,' Terry said.

'We all realise the importance of 
that. It's important for him to go out there and play his football, 
which he loves doing. He'll always be fully focused on the pitch.'

Police were alerted after the 
Association of British Bookmarkers raised concerns about a number of 
irregular bets, ranging from £200 to £500, on Jennings being red-carded.

Some of the activity is understood to have taken place via a new account opened in Liverpool – Rooney's home town.

One bet of £500, placed at odds of 10/1, netted £5,000.

Jennings had already been booked by referee Stevie O'Reilly when he was shown a straight red card seven minutes from time.

The 26-year-old reportedly asked the referee when he was going to 'stop cheating' Motherwell.

Speaking in the wake of the incident,
Jennings said: 'I want to make it clear I had no involvement whatsoever
in any betting scam.

'I want to clear my name as quickly as possible.'

It is understood Jennings became friends with the Rooney family after striking up a friendship with Richie's son, Thomas, 26.

By last night all nine men had been released on bail.
