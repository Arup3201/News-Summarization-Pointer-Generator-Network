Convicted: Kimberly Gale, 30, got behind the wheel of her Jeep after a night out in Plymoyth, Devon, before mounting the kerb, hitting a van and flipping her 4X4

A drunk mother who was arrested for driving on a pavement and flipping her Jeep told police they should be 'out catching real criminals'.

Kimberly Gale, 30, got behind the wheel after a night out in Plymouth, Devon, before mounting the kerb, hitting a van and tipping her 4x4 on to its side.

She then clambered out of her wrecked vehicle before telling officers they 'should be out catching real criminals'.

The mother-of-two was more than twice the legal limit when she tried to drive home from a pub, Plymouth Crown Court heard.

Handing Gale a six-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, Judge Paul Darlow told her that people who drive large vehicles dangerously count as 'real criminals'.

He said: 'You drove your 4x4 erratically and it ended up on its side, in my judgement causing a real and present danger to anyone else in that residential street.'

The court heard Gale had been drinking wine at her local pub on April 25 when she decided to drive home after an argument with the father of her children.

Prosecutor Alistair Verheijen said an off-duty police officer watched her climb into her vehicle before swerving from side to side as she pulled away.

As he followed behind he watched her mount a kerb at about 25mph before driving 'half-on, half-off' - two wheels in the road and two on the pavement - for 40 metres.

Mr Verheijen said the Jeep then clipped a parked van and rolled over on its side.

Gale, who is expecting her third child in February, was not badly hurt but the car was written off.

She had 85 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, more than twice the legal limit of 35.

However the court heard that when she was arrested for drink driving she told officers they 'should be out catching real criminals'.

Nigel Hall, defending, said Gale had only drunken two large glasses of wine before deciding to drive rather than walk.

He said: 'She tells me this court will not see her again. She feels incredibly ashamed of what she did.

'She realises what could have happened and thank goodness nobody was injured, including herself. It was that close she could have walked home from the pub but she made a bad decision.'

Gale, of Plymouth, Devon, admitted dangerous driving and driving while over the legal alcohol limit.

She was also banned from driving for two years and ordered to pay £500 in prosecution costs and an £80 victim surcharge.

Rant: The mother, who is expecting her third child in February, clambered out of the wrecked vehicle and told police officers they should be out catching 'real criminals'. She was then found to be twice over the legal limit

Scene: Gale was seen getting into the car by an off-duty police officer who then followed her as she drove along Radford Park Road in Plymouth
