Bleak future: Sir David Attenborough said big-budget programmes would lose funding

On and off screen, he has been responsible for some of the most enduring BBC programmes of the past 60 years.

But Sir David Attenborough fears that quality programming could soon become an endangered species because of the huge rise in on-demand internet services and digital networks.

The veteran wildlife presenter, who was controller of BBC2 in the 1960s, said the boom in satellite TV and online services such as Netflix – which has almost 50million subscribers – is leading a decline in viewing figures that will result in budget cuts.

He fears that output such as 
big-budget adaptations of Shakespeare plays will eventually only appear 
on niche networks which don’t have mass audiences.

Speaking at an event to mark the 50th anniversary of BBC Two, the 87-year-old was shown a series of clips highlighting its major cultural programmes, including a production of Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar by the National Youth Theatre.

The presenter of the renowned Life On Earth series said: ‘I think in another 25 years, or another fifty, that kind of stuff you see there…I don’t believe people will be producing Shakespeare.

'I really don't think they will, because the television audience is becoming split and split and split.

‘I saw figures the other day and Life 
on Earth got 17million viewers on the first showing and has had hundreds of 
millions since.

'You could sink money into making a production like that 
because you know what’s going to happen.

A BBC impartiality review that gave 
its coverage of the EU and immigration a clean bill of health was 
‘seriously flawed’, a report has found.

Last year’s Prebble report – commissioned by the BBC Trust – found its 
coverage was ‘broad and impressive’.

But
 a fresh study published by respected think-tank Civitas yesterday shed 
doubt on its methodology, saying a series of basic errors meant it was 
‘not independent and not worth the paper it was printed on.’

Civitas
 identified several flaws in the BBC report’s research methods and 
questioned the independence of its author Stuart Prebble.

The
 63-year-old – who is the former chief executive of ITV – has spent 
years making programmes for the BBC through his independent production 
company.

It
 said: ‘In particular, its analysis of output on BBC Radio 4’s Today 
programme was severely limited because it monitored less than half of 
the Today programme and then focused rigidly on the 7am to 8.30am block 
and ignored Saturday’s broadcasts altogether.’

Yesterday,
 Mr Prebble defended his report, saying: ‘I regard this as an 
ill-founded smear and the authors should be ashamed of themselves.’

A
 BBC Trust spokesman said: ‘We stand by the report and the conclusions 
that the Trust drew from it, and we do not recognise this inaccurate 
characterisation of it. 

‘The
 approach Stuart Prebble took in reaching his conclusions is consistent 
with that taken by all previous authors of impartiality reports for the 
Trust.’

‘But every time you get another satellite on the air, you are diminishing the audience. You won’t get audiences of 17million again.

'So eventually you won’t get the budget to make those sorts of programmes.’

‘So what will happen? Well, I suspect 
that specific organisations will decide they are going to circulate 
natural history programmes or Second Wold War documentaries, or operas 
or Shakespeare in a different kind of way, and it won’t be available as 
it is at the moment, and should be at the moment, to the universality 
that comes from a licence.’

As Controller Sir David was 
responsible for commissioning programmes such as Man Alive, Call My 
Bluff, Chronicle, Life, One Pair of Eyes, The Old Grey Whistle Test and 
Civilisation, a ground-breaking 13-part series on the history of Western
 art.

He later went on to present the world-renowned Life series for the BBC.

Recent years has seen a huge increase in on-demand online streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime and LoveFilm Instant.

Netflix now accounts for more than half the video streamed over the internet and has almost 50m subscribers. It now produces its own series like House of Cards and Orange is the New Black.

Sir David’s comments were echoed by the BBC’s creative director Alan Yentob, who said: ‘The great thing about British television is that the traditions that broadcasting has emerged from are traditions of intelligence and inclusivity.

‘Those values have been shared by the whole of public broadcasting. Now we are living in a different world. This is a very tricky moment we are talking about. You’ve got Netflix, you’ve got Amazon, you’ve got what might seem like benign predators who are no longer as benign.

‘They’re all public companies now and they’ve got very vast pockets.

‘The BBC is about to do a huge Shakespeare season thanks to the licence fee, and the public consensus needs to support the idea of these things if you still want to see the kind of things that we have valued for a long, long time.’

It was earlier this year that the BBC announced it was closing youth-orientated arts channel BBC Three following a series of cost-saving measures. The channel will be broadcast only online from Autumn 2015.
