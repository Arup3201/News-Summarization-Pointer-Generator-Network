Hurt: Distraught Anita Grinham, 37, says her life had been wrecked after she was attacked when her drink was spiked on a night out

A mother has told how her life was left in ruins after police made her feel like a liar when she reported being raped.

Anita Grinham told officers she was sexually assaulted in her own home by a man who had spiked her drink in a nightclub.

But she says the detectives did not take her allegations seriously and sided with her attacker.

Her claims were backed up by an internal inquiry that found key witnesses were not interviewed and the suspect’s house and car were left unsearched.

Although a suspect was arrested, the case did not reach court through lack of forensic evidence – another failing in the police investigation.

Miss Grinham, who has waived her anonymity to detail her ordeal, said her life was in ruins despite being vindicated by an apology from Suffolk police.

‘I know what happened to me – I was violated in the most horrendous way,’ said the 37-year-old mother of four.

‘Someone raped me and no one’s been punished. But I was made to feel like a liar. My whole life has changed. I went from being bubbly and outgoing to being paranoid and scared.

‘Because of this horrendous experience I lost my business.

‘I now suffer from panic attacks, depression and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Sorry is not good enough. My life stopped when I was raped. I have spent all my time since then trying to get justice.

‘I just hope what I have been through helps change things for other victims.’

Miss Grinham was attacked on a night out with friends in her home town of Ipswich in July 2008 to celebrate the opening of a beauty salon she had set up.

Because she was driving, she bought only one glass of wine, which she asked a doorman to look after while she went to the lavatory.

‘I vaguely knew this guy, as I had seen him in my local gym and I thought as a doorman he would be responsible,’ she said.

‘After I finished my drink I started to feel very peculiar – my legs felt funny and my friends said we should go home.

‘Apparently this doorman offered to drive my car home, as I felt awful and my friends had had too much to drink. The next thing I remember is waking up and he was on top of me.

‘I wanted to scream and scream but nothing would come out of my mouth – it was as if I was paralysed. My young children were asleep next door and I was just terrified.

Apology: Det Ch Supt Andy Henwood, of Suffolk Police, has said a new structure was now in place for 'allegations of rape are always taken seriously.'

‘I must have passed out as when I woke up again my head really hurt, I was totally naked and he had gone.

‘I was so terrified and distraught I went straight to the bathroom and started scrubbing myself with a nail brush.’

Miss Grinham said her attacker had warned her ‘not to do anything stupid’ after the incident.

She defied this harassment and  reported the crime to the police five weeks later. However, the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to proceed with charges due to lack of evidence.

After making a complaint to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, Miss Grinham was told in May 2010 that Suffolk police’s professional standards department would review the investigation.

Her complaint was upheld last June when the force apologised. Officers reopened the investigation but could not re-interview the suspect as there was no new DNA evidence.

Miss Grinham said the force’s response had made her feel she was being branded a liar.

The investigation stated: ‘Forensic opportunities were not considered, telephone evidence not sought, key witnesses not interviewed regarding the connected harassment incident, or re-interviewed in the case of the female acquaintances who had been with the complainant.

‘Equally, searches of the suspect’s home or the car used were not carried out, neither was he re-interviewed after conflicting accounts were obtained from the witnesses.’

While revealing that the officer who interviewed Miss Grinham was trained to deal with rape inquiries, the report states the officer in charge of the inquiry had no specialist training in sexual offences.

Detective Chief Superintendent Andy Hendwood of Suffolk Constabulary said: ‘Anita Grinham made a complaint to Suffolk Police via the IPCC in relation to how her case was investigated, which was reviewed by our Professional Standards Department.

‘As a result the PSD made a number of recommendations, which assisted with the new structure for rape investigations. Suffolk Constabulary has created a countywide Gemini Team with specialist rape-trained officers who work with the victim from the outset to ensure they receive the best possible support, advice and guidance. They follow national protocol and best practice compiled from forces throughout the country.’

Earlier this week a criminal justice joint inspection study criticised police in England and Wales for dismissing more than one in ten rape allegations to secure a higher conviction rate and meet targets.

It warned that target cultures have put forces under pressure to keep recorded crime to a ‘minimum’ and that foreign rapists could be escaping justice because police are failing to check the background of suspects.
