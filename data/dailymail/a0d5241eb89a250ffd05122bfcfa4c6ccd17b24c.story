A vigilante speed campaigner has been sacked by police for catching 'too many motorists' after he trapped more than 40,000 drivers.

David McCandless, 69, and his team of volunteers at Speed Watch caught around 1,600 speeding drivers every month in the Cambridgeshire towns of St Ives and Ramsey.

The group use hand-held speed cameras by the side of the road and then pass on the information police, who can then issue a warning letter to offenders. 

David McCandless, 69, was sacked from volunteer role at Speed Watch after he caught 'too many motorists'

But he claims his relationship with the force began to deteriorate when he was told he could only report less than 500 motorists a month.

Police told him staff could only process 2,000 cases across the whole country, so he would have to let some drivers off.

But the decision led to increasing tensions between the two parties before the former RAF engineer was dismissed by the force.

Mr McCandless, from St Ives, said: 'The police believed that we would exceed the resources of the business support unit.

'The fear of the police was that if we continued to issue 1,500 letters a month than we would prevent other schemes in the country from issuing their letters.

'We were basically letting speeders off. We would go with an extra 10 people who had been doing 45mph in a 30 zone but they wouldn't go over the quota.

'In the end because I kept going on at them I got a bit of a reputation but basically we were a victim of our own success.

'Because we were turning in these high numbers and they were so accurate they became suspicious that something was going on.'

He added: 'I basically got sacked for doing a good job and being too accurate.

'We were thorough and professional and we had a pride in what we were doing. I'm ex-armed forces and I always do everything by the book.

The volunteer scheme Community Speed Watch was rolled out by several police forces across the country to help educate people about speeding on the roads.

It currently manages 647 trained volunteers distributed across 88 local CSW groups.

Volunteers operate at the roadside in areas with 20, 30 and 40 mph limits, monitoring speeds with the aid of a portable speed indication device (SID).

They record and report the speed and identifying details of vehicles travelling at or above nationally-specified speed thresholds (25, 35 and 46mph respectively). 

Vehicle checks are undertaken by the police and letters sent to the registered keepers advising them of the speed and reminding them of why it is a community concern.

It is a form of education rather than enforcement, however, if problems persist enforcement can be undertaken by the police Safer Neighbourhood teams. 

People wishing to set up the scheme in their area have to be prepared to fund it, which can cost up to £3,000 for the equipment. 

'They are experts and they are professionals but none of them have "kerb-side" with us so they don't know what they are talking about.'

Mr McCandless had been coordinator of the volunteers since 2010 and his team increased the accuracy of their speed detectors using the same technology as the Dambusters.

They clipped on a wooden sight similar to those used by airmen to pinpoint the dropping point for the bouncing bombs designed by Barnes Wallis used in the dams raid.

He said his volunteers caught more motorists than any other scheme in the county because they targeted drivers at rush hour. 

Mr McCandless now plans to set up his own independent group and has complained to the Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) Sir Graham Bright about his treatment.

A spokesman for the PCC said they had written to the Chief Constable and asked him to respond to the claims.

But Cambridgeshire Constabulary has said Mr McCandless's position became 'unsustainable' as he was 'unable to share our vision of education'.

A police spokesman said: 'As a force, we support the great work of our SpeedWatch volunteers, and the work they do to help us educate drivers to change their behaviour through high visibility deployments in areas of community concern.

'We have 155 groups across the county - all made up of local volunteers, and we continue to work with those groups to make the county's roads safer.'
