A British schoolgirl had four abortions before her 16th birthday, new figures today revealed.

The unnamed teenager, who underwent her fourth termination in 2012, is among more than 200 under-16s to have had repeat abortions in the past three years.Â 

Shockingly, a further five of these girls had three abortions before reaching the age of consent.

It comes amid concern that terminations are being used by teenagers as an alternative form of contraception.

In 2011, a total of 84 under-16s had abortions for a second time or more, according to the Department of Health figures obtained by The Sun.

The total rose to 89 out of 2,925 under-16s to have abortions in 2012, but fell to 68 of 2,538 girls last year.

Last night, Norman Wells, of the Family Education Trust, said too many teenagers were having sex without thinking about the consequences.

'Too many are being taught that they have a right to sex without consequences and are free to dispose of any unborn child that threatens their lifestyle,' he said.

Last year, 185,331 British women of all age groups had terminations. Of these, 50 were treated for a staggering nine abortions of more.

Earlier this year, a 13-year-old schoolgirl was given the right to choose whether to have an abortion by a High Court judge.

Mr Justice Mostyn ruled that the youngster was capable of making up her own mind as to whether or not to keep the child.

The teenager, who lives with her parents, only realised she was pregnant when her grandmother spotted her growing bump and took her for medical tests.

She is believed to have thought she had been gaining a little weight for other reasons.

A scan at a local hospital confirmed she was pregnant, but the devastated girl said she was not ready to start a family at such a young age and wanted to have a termination.

She was 21 weeks pregnant when the case went before the High Court as an emergency hearing in mid-March.
