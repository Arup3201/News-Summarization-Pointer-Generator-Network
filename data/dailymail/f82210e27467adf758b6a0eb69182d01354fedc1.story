Passengers have revealed their terror after an aeroplane carrying 230 people was forced into an emergency landing at an airport following a catastrophic equipment failure.

The pilot was forced to bring the Boeing 767 in to land at Warsaw airport with no wheels after all its landing gear failed. The aircraft skidded along the tarmac on its belly, sparks flying, and a fire broke out in the starboard engine before it came to a halt.

Incredibly nobody on the flight, which came from Newark, New Jersey, was injured but after disembarking passengers spoke of their alarm.

'I was praying for the pilot not to lose control because we started to make circles over the airport. It was terrible,' said passenger Teresa Kowalik.

'We owe everything to the pilot. He really did a great job.'

The pilot told passengers 
four hours into the flight that the plane faced technical problems said a
 passenger who only gave her first name, Malgorzata.

'The pilot addressed us a 
number of times and said we should follow instructions. Later, a flight 
attendant said there might be a fire, and at that point people began to 
get nervous and uncertain,' she said.

The landing was not 
especially hard but the situation became alarming when sparks and black 
smoke rose from the plane, said Krzysztof Rozycki, a 17-year-old 
passenger.

A relative of a passenger said some on board panicked, crying and bidding final farewells to each other.

Relatives of passengers waiting at the airport sought information as the emergency unfolded.

Joanna Dabrowska, 29, 
managed to speak to her mother-in-law, a passenger, via mobile phone 
after she evacuated the flight. Dabrowska said some of the passengers 
apparently feared the worst.

'People were saying their final farewells to each other and some were sobbing,' she said.

Dabrowska was among a 
group of relatives waiting at the airport in a special room. Her 
mother-in-law was returning home after a month-long visit to Clinton, 
New Jersey.

According to the mother-in-law, passengers removed their shoes and evacuated the plane using the emergency slide.

'She was in shock, but she
 was fine,' said Dabrowska. She declined to give her mother-in-law's 
name because she didn't have her permission.

Other relatives at the 
airport would not talk to reporters. One woman whose husband and two 
sons were on board said she was relieved, but was shaking and declined 
to give her name or say more.

Passengers were taken to a
 medical center and were examined by doctors, said Przemyslaw 
Przybylski, a spokesman for the Warsaw airport.

Miraculous: Passengers escaped down the plane's emergency chutes after the landing at Warsaw. No one was injured

The captain, Tadeusz Wrona, has been hailed a hero by Poland's President Bronislaw Komorowsk, as well as by the airport staff and the Polish media.

LOT airlines president, 
Marcin Pirog, said that Captain Tadeusz Wrona and co-pilot 
Jerzy Szwartz carried out a 'perfect emergency landing,' which prevented
 anyone from being injured.

'It is the first time a 
LOT plane had to land without the landing gear out,' said Pirog, before 
adding that such landings do not always end well.

Poland's President Bronislaw Komorowski congratulated and thanked the crew and emergency workers for ensuring no one was hurt.

'I thank everyone with my whole heart in the name of Poland,' said Komorowski.

The airport has been 
closed until 8am on Wednesday. Flights which had been scheduled to land 
in Warsaw have been diverted to Lodz, Gdansk and Krakow.

Safe landing: The Boeing 767 came down on foam sprayed on the tarmac in an attempt to dampen any fires that broke out

As the situation unfolded emergency services were waiting at the 
end of the runway to deal with any potential disaster, while two F-16 fighter jets escorted it to the ground.

The pilot had radioed 
ahead to let the control tower know there was a problem with deploying 
the landing gear. After several attempts, however, it was decided that 
the aircraft would have to come down without any wheels.

While the plane circled 
the Polish capital for an hour, dumping excess fuel and repeatedly 
trying to solve the problem, ground crews prepared for a crash landing, 
closing the airport to all other flights and clearing nearby streets. 
Waiting fire crews also sprayed the runway with foam in a bid to prevent a fire 
from breaking out.

The
 pilot lifted the nose of the aircraft slightly as it approached the 
tarmac. As it slid along the runway, smoke billowed from the 
undercarriage followed by bright flashes from under the engines.

When
 it came to a halt, fire engines that were waiting along the sides and 
at the end of the tarmac rushed towards the plane, dowsing it with foam.
 Meanwhile, passengers were quickly taken off down the inflatable chutes
 on either side.

News
 channels and TV crews were on the scene soon after learning about the 
emergency and the incredible landing was beamed live around the world.

'All safety procedures 
worked perfectly fine and, thanks to this, nobody was injured,' said 
Leszek Chorzewski, spokesman for the Polish national flag carrier LOT, 
operator of the plane.
