Caitlin Hunt who died after being 'knocked off her scooter' and hit by a bus

A mother has paid tribute to her 'beautiful' nine-year-old daughter after she was knocked down and killed by a bus as she rode her scooter near her home.

Caitlin Hunt was playing with her brother and a friend outside a parade of shops when she apparently darted out in front of the single-decker.

Neighbours living nearby heard screams which 'went on for an eternity' and dashed to find her pregnant other Claire, 42, while paramedics tried to save her life.

However,  by the time the mother-of-nine arrived, Caitlin had died at the spot in Swindon, Wiltshire - which is now marked with floral tributes and cuddly toys.

Caitlin's older brother Aidan, 10, was with her when the accident happened at 5.50pm on Tuesday.

It is the second tragedy to befall the family in recent months after Caitlin’s eldest sister, Jamie, died from pneumonia aged just 22 last October.

Ms Hunt - who is pregnant with her tenth child - paid tribute to her daughter who dreamed of becoming a professional singer.

She said: 'Caitlin absolutely loved to sing. She loved having her photo taken and videoing herself. Caitlin wanted to be a star when she grew up.

'She said when she reached the age of 16 she wanted to go on Britain’s Got Talent and was also going to go on The X Factor.

'She was always singing. She seemed to start when she was just six months old and then didn’t stop.

'Her favourite band was One Direction, but she loved everything really.

'She was always asking to borrow my make-up, saying she wanted to look like me, but I just told her she didn’t need it as she was beautiful enough.

'I’m just feeling empty at the moment.

'She was loved by all of her brothers and sisters and absolutely adored her 13-month-old sister Georgia.

'Aidan is very quiet but he is coping and wants to go back to school.'

Dozens of flowers have been left at the scene, outside a row of shops in Blair Parade, Moredon, paying tribute to nine-year-old Caitlin Hunt who was killed after being 'knocked off her scooter by a bus'

Neighbours described the scene of the accident as 'carnage'.

'I was in my back garden and I heard this scream,' said Nicki Turnbull, 39.

'It was a girl and it went on for what seemed like eternity. I came out the front and it was carnage.'

Another neighbour who did not want to be named said she called the ambulance to the small parade of shops in Moredon.

She said: 'I heard just lots of noise and shouting and I thought it was dogs fighting.

'I looked out and saw the bus and called the ambulance. I didn’t know it was a little girl at the time.'

Ms Hunt thanked residents who tried to help her daughter before she arrived.

She added: 'Several people rushed over to try and save her and we are very grateful for that.'

Fellow pupils and teachers at Rodbourne Cheney Primary School, where Caitlin was a pupil also paid tribute to the ‘popular’ schoolgirl, 
who has been described as ‘a vibrant and passionate learner’.
