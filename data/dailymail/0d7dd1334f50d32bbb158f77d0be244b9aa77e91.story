Top barrister: Amal Alamuddin is defending a suspected Libyan war criminal accused of masterminding the Lockerbie bombing

Having won the heart of the world’s most eligible bachelor, Amal Alamuddin is getting used to being the centre of attention.

But George Clooney’s fiancée has also hit the spotlight for a very different reason – defending a suspected Libyan war criminal accused of masterminding the Lockerbie bombing.

It has been just a week since her engagement to the Hollywood heart-throb was revealed but it is already clear that the high-flying barrister is not about to let her career take a back seat.

The international human rights lawyer is representing Abdullah al-Senussi, Colonel Gaddafi’s former right-hand man, who is accused of numerous atrocities against his people.

She is helping the 64-year-old appeal against the decision to allow his trial to take place in Libya, where he could face the death penalty.

Beirut-born, Oxford University-educated Miss Alamuddin, 36, previously represented WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange during his fight against extradition to Sweden on sex assault charges.

She was also a legal adviser to Bahrain’s king, Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa, who has been accused by human rights groups of systematic torture and repression.

al-Senussi was convicted in absentia by a French court for the 1989 bombing of a French airliner. In Libya he is accused of overseeing a prison massacre of 1,200 inmates as well as torture and hangings. He was charged along with Gaddafi’s playboy son, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, with war crimes and crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court.

Under United Nations rules, the Hague court was due to hear the case unless Libya could prove that it was capable of overseeing it.

Libya was given approval last October, despite allegations that al-Senussi had been mistreated  in custody.

But Miss Alamuddin said Libya refused to allow her or any of his ICC-appointed defence team to visit him, which, she says, should have been a red flag to the ICC.

The trial began last month in controversial conditions as al-Senussi appeared in a steel cage looking emaciated and prosecutors refused to let him see the evidence against him.

Miss Alamuddin said: ‘The whole point of the ICC is to be there when national systems cannot do the job. Instead, it is giving a flawed, dangerous process the stamp of approval.’ When asked why she is defending a suspected war criminal, she declined to comment.

However, her colleague at London’s 
Doughty Street Chambers, John Jones QC, said: ‘Justice needs defence 
lawyers. The system only works if there’s robust advocacy on both 
sides.
