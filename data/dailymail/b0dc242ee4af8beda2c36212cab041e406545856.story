The business of cleaning up the trail of space junk left by more than 60 years of space exploration has long baffled scientists.

Now British space experts think they may have the answer - a space harpoon.

Next week, at a European Space Agency conference in Darmstadt, Germany, experts from across the globe will discuss the state of our skies and the growing threat posed by space debris.

British space experts think they may have the answer to clearing up the trail of space junk - a space harpoon. A 'chase' satellite would be fitted with five or more harpoons which can fire at a moving target

Using laser and radar guidance systems, a piece of space junk would be targeted, and then captured with a gas-propelled harpoon on a tether

Once the space junk is secured, a smaller sub-satellite detaches from the chase satellite and pulls the junk downwards to burn up as it re-enters the Earth's atmosphere

Once the space junk is secured, a 
smaller sub-satellite detaches from the chase satellite and pulls the 
junk downwards to burn up as it re-enters the Earth's atmosphere.

Then the chase satellite would then search out another target

But Britain already has a unique answer.

Dr Jamie Reed, from Astrium UK, told the Times: 'We've built a harpoon'

It comes as the Stevenage based company announces it has been awarded a study contract by the French space agency CNES to tackle the problem of space junk.

The study, awarded as part of the Orbital Transfer Vehicle (OTV) 
programme, will focus on the removal of large pieces of space debris 
between now and 2020. 

The Earth is surrounded by an 
ever-growing cloud of space junk, which Nasa has estimated contains 
500,000 objects bigger than a marble, and 22,000 bigger than a cricket 
ball.

Space has become a critical part of our infrastructure - from weather 
forecasting and Earth observation, to GPS and telecommunications.

It is 
feared that space junk could pose a very real threat to these vital 
services.

Experts hope the system could remove around five pieces of space debris a year.

The first space tests of this harpoon 
are scheduled within the next three years.

Since the first object, Sputnik One, was launched into space 53 years ago, mankind has created a swarm of perhaps tens of millions of items of debris.

ever-growing cloud of space junk, which Nasa has estimated contains 
500,000 objects bigger than a marble, and 22,000 bigger than a cricket 
ball.

The rubbish circling the planet comes from old rockets, abandoned satellites and missile shrapnel.

It is estimated that there are 500,000 pieces of space junk floating in Earth's orbit.

If they are successful a 
working device could follow before 2020.

'Through this latest study, Astrium will pave the way to solving a major issue for all space users,' said Astrium Space Transportation CEO Alain Charmeau.

Recent
studies by the European Space Agency and Nasa have shown that the 
amount of space debris, particularly in low­-Earth orbit, could cause 
'collision cascading' also known as the Kessler effect, which would 
hamper all space activity for 50 years.

These
studies also point out that the effect can be stabilised by removing, 
between now and 2020, between five and 10 items of large space debris.

'In mobilising our industrial resources in conjunction with those of national agencies, we will put forward innovative solutions and technologies capable of dealing with space debris and thereby ensuring the sustainable development of space,' Mr Charmeau said.

Germany's space
agency DLR is experimenting with a projectile net that can envelope a
piece of space junk before pulling it out of orbit and a 'litter-picker' that grabs debris with a robot arm and pulls it back to Earth.
