Secret audio recordings of New Mexico governor Susana Martinez lambasting her opponent in the 2010 gubernatorial race as 'little b****' were revealed on Wednesday.

The country's first female Hispanic governor is also caught on tape questioning the purpose of a cabinet-level position for a member of the state's commission on women.

The controversial recordings, released by left-wing publication Mother Jones, also include a clip of a Martinez adviser condescendingly discussing the inability of one of the state's Hispanic legislator's to fluently speak English.

Secret recordings of New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez, pictured in January, were released Wednesday that frame the popular governor unfavorably

'I'm so tired of that little b**** calling me a liar,' Martinez can be heard saying of then-Lieutenant Governor Diane Denish in a five-second clip.

The clip provided by Mother Jones provides no context for the statement, but the publication's accompanying story claims Martinez made the comment while watching a tape of their recent debate, and the Martinez campaign has not refuted it.

In a longer clip Martinez refers to a woman who came up to her at an event and said she worked for for the state's commission on the Status of Women and claimed to be a cabinet-level official.

'What the hell is that?' Martinez asks.

After her deputy campaign manager confirms the position to her, Martinez reiterates her confusion about the purpose of the position.

'I just don't know what they do. I understand that we have ten cabinet 
positions, more than the federal government, but some of these seem to 
be in name only,' she says. 'I don't get what the hell does a position on women's 
cabinet do all day long?'

'But she sure was my best friend all day long,' Martinez adds, laughing, at which point the male deputy campaign manager makes a joke about another male campaign adviser wanting to be appointed to the commission so that he can study women.

'Oh, s***,' Martinez responds, still laughing.

In the audio recordings a Martinez adviser says that former New Mexico House Speaker Ben Lujan sounds like a 'retard' when he speaks in English. Lujan is pictured here in Feb. 18, 2010. He passed away in 2012

Martinez's deputy campaign manager can also be heard in another clip making fun of the state's former speaker of the House, Ben Lujan.

'Somebody told me he's absolutely eloquent in Spanish, but his English? He sounds like a retard.'

Lujan passed away in 2012 after a battle with cancer.

Mother Jones is the publication responsible for releasing the infamous '47 percent' video that irreparably damaged former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romeny's 2012 presidential bid.

The audio clips Mother Jones released of Martinez were part of a longer profile the publication published framing Martinez as 'nasty, juvenile, and vindictive.' The article's author, Andy Kroll, likens Martinez to 'brash,' embattled New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.

Martinez, a Republican who is up for reelection this year, and her advisers seem unfazed by the recordings, however.

In a statement posted on Martinez's campaign website, spokesman Chris Sanchez played Mother Jone's article and its release of the recordings off as 'cheap political attacks,' as well as an attempt to 'smear' Martinez in order to undercut the Republican Party's standing with Hispanics.

'Today, an extreme left-wing blog posted four-year-old material from private conversations undoubtedly sent to them by individuals or their allies who are either under federal indictment, or have had their homes raided by the FBI for their role in stealing or distributing Governor Susana Martinezâ€™s email,' Sanchez wrote.

'That the national Left is trying to smear the first Hispanic woman governor in American history because they view her as a threat is about as surprising as the National Enquirer reporting that Elvis is still alive.'

The statement goes on to snarkily address the Governor's use of the b-word in the recordings.

'Yes, the Governor used salty language in a private conversation four years ago with close advisers and will pay the appropriate penalty to the cuss jar.'

A strategist familiar with the campaign's thinking predicted that the recordings would actually help Martinez in her governor's race. 'People actually want a tough Governor,'  the source said, adding that New Mexico is still a 'Wild Wild West' of sorts and that the 'machismo' spirit is rewarded there.

'Strong women advance in politics,' the strategist continued. 'She is a woman, and she can kind of get away with that more.'

'People want 
her to do well. People look at her and want her to stand up and fight.'

The strategist admitted that what the campaign's adviser said about Lujan was 'crazy, but its certainly not a Bridgegate'

In its article on Martinez, Mother Jones likens the New Mexico governor's behavior in the secret recordings to that of embattled New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. A source close to Martinez rejected that comparison, saying the recordings are no 'Bridgegate'

Bridgegate is the scandal afflicting Chris Christie's adminstration in which the governor's staff took retribution on a political foe by closing lanes on a major bridge in New Jersey, trapping cars on the bridge for hours.

Martinez has consistently had one of the highest approval ratings for a state leader since she took office. A recent poll of New Mexicans put her approval rating at 52 percent. The same poll found her leading her most likely opponent, state Attorney General Gary King, by five points with 47 percent of the vote. She is expected to win the Governor's race and is considered a potential dark horse candidate in the 2016 election.
