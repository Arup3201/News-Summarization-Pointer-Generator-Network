MAN CITY MUST DOMINATE IN EUROPE TO KEEP SHEIKH MANSOUR SATISFIED

JENKINSON, GAYLE AND WICKHAM DESERVE ENGLAND RECOGNITION

In May 2013 Ashley Cole left the Wembley pitch having captained England against the Republic of Ireland. He said this: 'It’s a very proud moment for me and one I’ll never forget. I wanted to be captain, it was a dream come true. I’ve lived a little boy’s dream today.'

Less than a year on Cole has retired from international football, after he got the dreaded call from Roy Hodgson, telling him he wouldn’t be going to the World Cup.

Where did it all go wrong?

I blame Jose Mourinho – he’s had a detrimental effect on Cole’s career twice now, and that’s sackable in my book.

Dream come true: Ashley Cole is presented with a golden cap by England manager Roy Hodgson to mark a century of caps for the national team prior to the friendly with the Republic of Ireland last May

Lionheart: Cole has been England's first choice left-back for a decade but announced his international retirement after being omitted from the World Cup squad

Ruined: Jose Mourinho ended Cole's World Cup chances by making him a bit-part player at Chelsea this season

Cole was a marauding, dynamic, attacking full-back at Arsenal. He was sometimes the Gunners’ biggest threat – here’s one example: he was described as Arsenal’s 'most menacing attacker' when he got the winner at Manchester City in September 2004, which is incredible when you think that Dennis Bergkamp, Thierry Henry, Freddie Ljungberg and Jose Antonio Reyes were all playing that day.

Cole claimed Arsenal went back on a promise so off he went to Chelsea where Mourinho barely let him go over the halfway line. He regularly got into the opposition box at Arsenal – he has never scored for a Mourinho team.

Cole’s game changed – he won medals at Chelsea of course, but his development hasn't reached a high level - he should have gone on to be the very best attacking full-back in the world for a decade.

Mourinho returned and single-handedly wrecked any chance Cole had of going to another World Cup. He picked a right-back at left-back, leaving Ashley out in the cold.

Sure, Azpilicueta had a good season, but ultimately Chelsea had an unsuccessful season. Was it worth it? What point was Jose making by leaving Cole out?

Cole played over 50 games in 2012-13, and ended the season as England captain. He had no reason to think a year on he wouldn’t be a Chelsea regular, and wouldn’t be going to the World Cup.

Competition: Cole's place at left-back has been taken by Cesar Azpilicueta this season, a natural right-back

Solid: The Spaniard has adapted well to the Premier League and Cole has been unable to regain his place

When he looks back on his career, Cole will be able to count a lot of medals – he has won everything the club game can bring. But he will also realise Mourinho ruined his career not once, but twice.

I’m gutted for Cole, I’ve interviewed him a few times but I don’t know him as a person. As a footballer he has amazing talent.

Mourinho has robbed him of the chance to be the undisputed best player in his position in the world by not allowing him to express himself on the pitch. And now the Chelsea manager has robbed Cole of a chance to play at another World Cup.
