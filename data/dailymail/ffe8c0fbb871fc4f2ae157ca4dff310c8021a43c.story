Cars buried under feet of snow, canceled buses and icy sidewalks might be  things of the past in New York City.

A report from the New York Panel on Climate Change found that a dramatic shift in temperature will make winters in the city resemble those of Birmingham, Alabama, by 2050.

Snow long: Climate researchers in New York said that winters in the city will look more like Alabama's by 2050, with a similar warming for summer

With an increase of around five degrees in the average temperature, the number of days where temperatures drop under 32 degrees will go from 72 to a range of 42 to 48.

More worryingly, the temperature rise will push the number of days above 90 degrees to a range of 39 to 52 and increase the rate of heat waves.

WNYC reports that with the increase in average temperature, the number of heat-related deaths is predicted to rise up to 500 percent if the city doesn't adapt.

One brutal heat wave in Chicago in 1995 killed about 750, while a sweltering 2003 in France killed 15,000 people, most of whom were elderly.

The transformation of the city to Alabama's milder winter weather will leave New York seeing much less snow but more precipitation.

According to the Weather Channel, Alabama's average low currently never goes below freezing, and winter weather is extremely mild, even warm.

Birmingham has never had a true white Christmas according to the National Weather Service - though in 2010 flurries and some slush fell over the city for a short period of time.

Future spikes in temperature are not likely to keep this year from bringing another snowy winter.

Farmer's Almanac has predicted that 'winter will bring a frosty bite' for much of the United States, making it possible that 2015 is a repeat of two years ago, when snowstorms pounded the Northeast.

The nation has already experienced a snowy autumn, with areas of South Dakota setting a new record for earliest snow, and parts of the Rockies and Great Plains experiencing significant snowfall in September.

The almanac's predictions can be dicey at best, and there is nothing suggesting extreme weather, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration meteorologist Anthony Artusa told CBS.

NOAA's long-term forecast, which gives a three-month outlook, will be delivered later in October.

An increase in the average temperature of about five degrees will also raise how often and how long heat waves are in the city

Farmer's Almanac has predicted a 'frosty bite' this winter, though NOAA's long-term forecast has not been released
