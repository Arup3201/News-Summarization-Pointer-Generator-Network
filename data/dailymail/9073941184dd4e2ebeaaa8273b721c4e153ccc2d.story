It is set to be the ultimate mobile phone for the paranoid, able to keep your texts and pictures away from prying eyes.

A Swiss firm today revealed plans for the 'world's most secure' mobile phone.

Called the Blackphone, it runs a special version of Google's Android software designed to make privacy settings far easier to use.

The blackphone will run special 'secure software' and its maker say it will be completely secure

Although the exact specs have not released, the firm says the handset will:

Make and receive secure phone calls

Exchange secure texts

Exchange and store secure files

Have secure video chat; browse privately

Anonymise your activity through a VPN

'Blackphone, powered by a security-oriented Android build named 
PrivatOS, is a carrier- and vendor-independent smartphone giving 
individuals and organizations the ability to make and receive secure 
phone calls, exchange secure texts, transfer and store files, and video 
chat without compromising user privacy on the device,' the firm said.

It plans to unveil the phone in February.

'It comes preinstalled with all the tools you need to move throughout the world, conduct business, and stay in touch, while shielding you from prying eyes,' the firm's website says.

'It's the trustworthy precaution any connected worker should take, whether you're talking to your family or exchanging notes on your latest merger & acquisition.'

The handset is being made by two firms, Silent Circle and Geeksphone, who have created a new Switzerland-based joint venture to sell it.

They have worked with several well known computer security experts, including Phil Zimmermann, creator of PGP, a widely used system to allow secure communication via email.

the Blackphone is claimed to be far more secure than current mobiles - although the firm behind it has yet to reveal exactly how it will work

'I have spent my whole career working towards the launch of secure telephony products,' said Zimmermann.

'Blackphone provides users with everything they need to ensure privacy and control of their communications, along with all the other high-end smartphone features they have come to expect.'
