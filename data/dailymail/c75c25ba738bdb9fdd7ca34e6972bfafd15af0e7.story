A three-year-old boy has died after falling into a pot of boiling sugar syrup when a rickshaw crashed into his mother, knocking him out of her arms, in a busy Delhi street.

The boy, named only as Dev, fell into the steaming sugar which had been left outside a sweet shop, and later died in hospital.

In response, Delhi High Court has ordered an immediate ban of the battery-powered rickshaws which often carry double the recommended four passengers at high speeds in the Indian capital.

Tragedy: Three-year-old Dev, pictured with his mother Pinky, died after falling into a pot of boiling sugar syrup outside a sweet shop in Delhi when an e-rickshaw knocked him out of his mother's arms

The accident took place on Wednesday, as Dev’s mother Pinky was holding her son while standing by a sweet shop in the Trilokpuri area of Delhi.

A three-wheeled e-rickshaw carried into them at high speed and knocked Dev out of her arms and into the pot of boiling sugar.

'I was carrying Dev in my arms, when suddenly we were hit by the speeding e-rickshaw while we were standing outside a sweet shop, Pinky said.

'I lost my balance and my son fell inside the pot filled with hot syrup prepared for jalebis.

'I started screaming for help, but no one came forward.'

Grief: Dev's mother Pinky, pictured during a family protest outside the local police station, suffered severe burns on her arms as she attempted to save her son from the steaming vat of syrup

Fatal incident: Family members, with Pinky seen right, grieve during the protest on Wednesday, shortly after Dev died in hospital from his injuries, as they demanded the culprit be found

Pinky suffered severe burns on her 
hands and arms as she pulled her son out of the pot, and both were taken
 to the Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi, where Dev later died.

The
 e-rickshaw driver fled the scene, but despite leaving the vehicle 
behind, police are struggling to identify the owner as it was not 
registered with the city government's transport department.

Family
 members have been protesting outside the local police station, 
demanding that authorities take action against the culprit.

In
 the meantime, the family are considering pressing charges against the 
owner of the sweet shop for placing the boiling pot on the road.

Unregulated and overcrowded e-rickshaws have been an issue in Delhi since they first began to grow in popularity in 2008.

‘The
 state cannot allow e-rickshaw drivers to take law into their hands. The
 government and authorities will forthwith take steps to prevent plying 
of e-rickshaws without fail,' A Delhi High Court division bench said on Thursday.

‘There
 is no specific load or number of passengers that they are required to 
carry. They are not registered. They have no insurance,’ the bench also 
observed.

A hearing at Delhi High Court on August 14 will discuss new rules for the vehicles, and a potential complete ban.
