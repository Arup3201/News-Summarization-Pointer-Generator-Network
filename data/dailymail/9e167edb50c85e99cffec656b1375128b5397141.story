Residents of a town in western Mexico set fire to at least three trailer trucks on Thursday to protest the arrival of 600 vigilantes to their community.

The burning trucks blocked roads leading into Paracuaro in Michoacan state before federal police and soldiers removed them.

The ‘self-defense’ group arrived Saturday in pickup trucks and SUVs and set up a checkpoint at the entrance to Paracuaro, a town of artisans and lime farmers.

The situation in Paracuaro is akin to a civil war, with drug dealers, the police, vigilantes and locals, all fighting each other

Vigilante
 groups have formed to confront drug cartels in parts of Michoacan, a 
rich farming state that is a major exporter of limes, avocados and 
mangos.

Rumors circulate 
that some self-defense groups have been infiltrated by the New 
Generation cartel, charges that the groups vehemently deny.

New Generation has been fighting a turf war with the Michoacan-based Knights Templar cartel.

Some
 people in the region say members of the Knights Templar have also tried
 to use self-defense groups as cover for illegal activities.

The
 vigilantes drove into the town in black armoured vehicles shouting 
'don't be frightened, we are vigilantes', before expelling drugs 
traffickers.

Local vigilantes armed themselves to take control of Paracuaro back - they accuse police of being in league with the gangs and say they have to protect themselves

Michoacan has 
been rocked by repeated explosions of civil unrest since February last 
year, as vigilante groups have sprung up in communities where people say
 they are not being protected from drugs trafficking gangs.

Over
 in the neighbouring state of Guerrero, which produces half of Mexico's 
heroin and is riddled with drugs gangs, members of the Public Safety 
System, or the Guerrero community police, marched yesterday to 
commemorate the first anniversary of their foundation in Ayutla de los 
Libres.

Insecurity dominates
 the lives of millions of Mexicans, for whom taking the law into their 
own hands has become the only option.  Drugs cartels make millions of 
dollars producing and selling drugs, so the land where they produce 
opium poppies and marijuana is highly prized and often fought 
over.
