A man Oregon prosecutors described as 'evil' has been found guilty of multiple felonies stemming from his 'methodical' plot to kill the father of his grandson.

Lester 'Earl' Reger,
57, of Ontario, found guilty of attempted aggravated murder, 
conspiracy to commit murder, felony possession of a firearm and assault 
in the second degree.

Malheur County District Attorney Dan Norris described Reger's horrific plot including a plan to turn his garage into a 'death chamber'.

Death chamber: Reger had covered his garage in plastic wrap to hid the evidence

Evil: Prosecutors called the Reger's plan 'diabolical'

'It was the entire methodical plan. It was the plastic. It was 
packing the car so that they'd have room for the body,' Norris said.

Reger was sentenced to 11 years in 
prison. Reger, his wife Erlene Reger and 
two men, plotted to lure Ramon Fry into the Regers' garage where they would murder him.

Erlene was found guilty of her part that month and is now 
serving a 90-month prison sentence. The garage had already been plastic-wrapped so they could hide the evidence.

'In 26 years of violence, very few things have scared me as much as 
walking into that garage that night,' Norris said. 'It was a death chamber.'

Reger faked an arm injuring so he could hide a gun in a sling. Then he asked Fry if he could do him a favor.

'They ask him to pick these three little pieces of wood up [from 
under a work bench], and when he was down there picking those up, the 
defendant Earl Reger put the 25-caliber gun up to the back of his head 
and pulled the trigger and tried to execute him,' Norris told KTVB.

Regers thought Fry was abusing 
their grandchild despite investigations by multiple agencies clearing him.

The shot didn't kill Fry who began to run, while Reger again fired at him.

Fry was able to escape before they murdered him.

'Once Ramon Fry was dead, they would have taken the plastic down, 
wrapped the body up, they had duct tape and additional plastic 
available,' Norris said. 'They had a change of clothes laid out in the garage. They 
also had a change of clothes in the car.'

Another defendant, Todd Mulvaine, had already dug a grave on his own property to hide Fry's body.

Mulvaine has also been found guilty of charges stemming from his involvement.

'This was so methodically planned. But for the fact that the first 
shot didn't kill him, they might have gotten away with this,' Norris 
said.

Reger had testified in his own defense, claiming the garage was plastic wrapped to refinish and spray furniture. He also claimed Fry was the one who brought the gun into the garage.

'Next thing I know, I see a pistol in his hand and it goes off. I 
grabbed the gun from him and he tackles me. As I'm starting to go down, I
put the gun to the back of his head and pulled the trigger,' Reger told jurors.

Reger claimed he was on his back with Fry above him, and that he then fired on him again.

'Probably the best thing I ever heard was when I called the victim 
yesterday and told him, 'We're going to sentence at 10:30 tomorrow 
morning. Can you make it? And if you can't we'll reschedule.' And he 
just said, 'You know these people have taken enough from me. I have my 
son tomorrow. You sentence him and tell me what happens,'' Norris said.
