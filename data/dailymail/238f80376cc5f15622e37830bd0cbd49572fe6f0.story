Bizarre rubber 'beauty masks', gruesome artworks made from dried human skin and a porcelain fruit decorated with sexual scenes are among an eclectic array of pieces set to go on display in London from this month.

Part of a new display at the Wellcome Collection in London, the A to Z of the Human Condition begins with 'Acts of Faith' and ends with 'Zoonoses' - diseases transmitted to humans by animals.

But unusual though zoonoses are, what really catches the eye are the alternatively touching and revolting snapshots into human life through the centuries, starting with a beauty treatment that no modern woman would want to try - rubber beauty masks.

Beauty: These rubber 'beauty masks', seen in a photo taken in 1921, were thought to remove wrinkles

The masks, a British invention, peaked in popularity during the 1920s thanks to the belief that they helped remove wrinkles and blemishes.

Equally popular at the time was another British invention, the Claxton earcap, which was patented by inventor Adelaide Claxton in 1925 and was thought to correct 'outstanding ears'.

But unpleasant sounding beauty gizmos weren't just the preserve of the British: The exhibition also includes a pair of tiny shoes made to be worn by Chinese women with bound feet.

Once common in China, the practice - also known as 'Lotus Feet' - involved bending the toes backwards and breaking the arch of the foot before binding them in a bid to create attractively tiny extremities.

Uncomfortable: The Claxton Earcap was patented in 1925 and was designed to cure sticking out ears

Tiny: These shoes, which were made circa 1870, were designed for a wearer with bound feet

Uncomfortable: Another dodgy U.K beauty gizmo, this brass corset was worn in a bid to whittle down the waist

Although binding began to lose ground among the elite from the mid-1800s onwards, it took until 1949 and the advent of Communist rule for the tradition to be banned entirely.

But the exhibition isn't all foot binding and beauty masks. Among the more gruesome exhibits is a pair of sandals featuring a thicket of iron spikes that point up towards the foot.

The shoes, which were worn by Indian fakirs (Muslim Sufi ascetics), were designed to cause maximum pain, with wearers believing that mastering the agony was a route to achieving enlightenment.

Even more revolting is a set of preserved tattoos on human skin which date from the 1950s and feature a series of jolly motifs.

Excruciating: These sandals, made circa 1871, were worn by Sufis in a bid to gain enlightenment through pain

Revolting: This French-made 'Souvenir du Sahara' was made using dried human skin circa 1850

Vast: 50st Daniel Lambert was born in Leicester in 1770 and became the Britain's 'most corpulent' man

'Rather than attempt to define the human 
condition, this A-Z gives an imperfect and impressionistic presentation,' comments curator Danielle Olson.

'As meaning-seeking and empathetic creatures, I hope visitors will enjoy
 the opportunities it offers to pause for thought, to wonder and to 
share experiences.

'Although the exhibition doesn't reveal the meaning of
 life, it grapples with many of its questions and offers glimpses of how
 others have done so before.'

The exhibition, which runs until 12th October, also includes paintings by Hieronymus Bosch and a porcelain fruit decorated with graphic sexual scenes.

In a nod to modern lifestyles, also on display is a 19th century oil painting of Daniel Lambert who, until recently, was immortalised in the Dictionary of National Biography as 'the most corpulent man of whom record exists'.

Weighing 50st when he died, Lambert, who was born in 1770, claimed he ate and drank moderately but cashed in on his corpulence with circus appearances.

The A to Z of the Human Condition runs until 12th October at the Wellcome Collection. For more information, see wellcomecollection.org
