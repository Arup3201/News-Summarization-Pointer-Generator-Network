Jessa Duggar bucks tradition and opts for a pale blush pink bridal gown instead of classic white on tonight's new episode of 19 Kids and Counting, as TLC reveals that last week's season nine return was the show's highest-rated premiere ever.

Not surprisingly, the 22-year-old's wedding to Ben Seewald, 19, is a major plot point on this already record-breaking season, and Tuesday's episode shows Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar's fifth child heading to the Tesori Bridal in Fayetteville, Arkansas with her family in search of the perfect dress.

Although Jessa and Ben married last November, fans are only now seeing the moments that led up to their highly-anticipated ceremony - and her unconventional choice of color for her wedding gown.

Breathtaking: Jessa Duggar, 22, tried on a cap-sleeved lace wedding gown on Tuesday night's episode of 19 Kids and Counting

Bride-to-be: The 22-year-old posed in a veil at Tesori Bridal in Fayetteville, Arkansas as she prepared for her wedding to 19-year-old Ben Seewald 

A clip from the episode first captured Jessa modeling a form fitting white lace gown for her family, including her mother and her now mother-in-law Guinn Seewald.

'Even though Jessa is not a starry eyed bride-to-be, she is still my little Jessa Blessa,' Michelle told the cameras. 'And if I picture her walking down the aisle to be given away to Ben I realize this is a very special moment.'

While her family was filled with gasps as she walked out, Jessa announced that she wasn't entirely sure about the dress. 

Jessa was then compared to Cinderella when she tried on her next gown, a pale pink A-line dress featuring cap-sleeves and a fully beaded bodice.

While Ben's mother started to tear up as she watched her future daughter-in-law search for a dress, Jessa began falling in love with the blush bridal gown because of its unique color.

Race to get ready: While Jessa was determined to find a wedding gown because there wasn't enough time to order a dress, her mom Michelle Duggar, 48, noted that the trip to the bridal boutique is 'very special moment'

Difference of opinion: After seeing Jessa try on a pale pink bridal gown, five-year-old Josie (left) and six-year-old Jordyn (right) discussed what colors they want their wedding dresses to be 

'I've seen some pictures of blush-colored dresses in magazines, and I thought: "That's pretty cool. That's different,"' Jessa said. 'It's not your traditional white gown.'

The footage captured the youngest Duggers, Jordyn, six, and Josie, five, having an on camera debate about what color a wedding dress should be.

While Jordyn thought a bride should wear white, Josie chose the unconventional color blue before she revealed that she too wanted to wear pink.

For her final dress, Jessa put on another white lace gown, which featured sheer three-quarter sleeves.

But she was still clearly taken with the blush dress.

Her third option also reminded her of the gown that her 23-year-old sister Jill Duggar wore to marry 25-year-old Derick Dillard last June.

Imitation game: Jessa said this dress looked too much like the one her 23-year-old sister Jill wore to marry 25-year-old Derick Dillard last June

Fan club: Michelle watched her daughter model dresses along with the other female members of the Duggar family

Emotional moment: Jessa's now mother-in-law teared up while watching Jessa try on gowns 

'I don't want to have the exact same dress as Jill,' she explained. 'Our weddings are pretty close together, and so I thought maybe it would be fun to have something a little bit different.'

Although it is still unknown as to whether or not she purchased her dress on that particular day, fans of Jessa know that she ended up walking down the aisle in the same blush-colored gown that she favored in the store.

Tonight's episode of 19 Kids and Counting follows last week's record-breaking premiere, which focused on Jill's announcement that she was pregnant - just one month after walking down the aisle.

According to Nielson ratings, the episode was the series's highest-rated premiere ever, as well as the number one ranked cable program on prime time among women.

The show was also last Tuesday's second most tweeted reality series across cable and broadcast. 

The Duggar's successful season nine return was followed by the debut of TLC's newest series Our Little Family, which chronicles the lives of the Hamill family, whose five members all have achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism.
