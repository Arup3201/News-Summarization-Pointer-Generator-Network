She unveiled a stellar autumn/winter 2015  collection at New York fashion week on Sunday, but Victoria Beckham ins't the only member of the family to be making waves in the fashion world.

Her three-year-old daughter Harper, who is clearly keen to follow in her mother's fashionable footsteps, has been championing some stylish outfit choices in recent weeks.

The youngest Beckham has obviously adopted her mother's love of the Little Black Dress and was seen sporting a chic Tamara black pleated dress FW14 by Bonpoint to watch Victoria's AW15 show.

Harper Beckham, pictured landing in New York this weekend, definitely takes the crown as the world's trendiest tot. Here, she wears trendy skinny jeans, a fedora and brown Chelsea boots - thought to be from Chloe's yet-to-launch collection - and a £213 Monnalisa coat

The Peter Pan collared frock, which costs £185, has already sold out - proving that Harper is already a style icon in her own right.

The day before, Harper wore trendy skinny jeans with a smart pea coat and brown Chelsea boots, accessorised with a beige felt hat which covered her ever-growing locks.

Speaking about Harper's style, Lulu Rayne, buyer of the Step2wo childrenswear concession at Harvey Nichols, said: 'Brands are always keen to get their clothes worn by celebrities and children are no different, particularly children with a global profile like Harper's.

'They could have made up these pieces especially for Harper if they were keen for her to showcase their new collection to the world.'

It's official: two of New York Fashion Week's most watched women, Kim Kardashian and Victoria Beckham have been upstaged by their adorable daughters.

But whilst little North West has been hitting the headlines for her tantrums, Harper Beckham managed to hold it together for her mother's Fall 2015 catwalk show. Well, when surrounded by Anna Wintour, as well as David, Brooklyn, Romeo and Cruz Beckham, who wouldn't be stunned into silence?!

As ever, she looked ridiculously cute, this time wearing a black pleated dress by Bonpoint, which features a cutesy contrast Peter Pan collar. We love this formal frock, and Harper has clearly inherited her mum's love of the little black dress!

Unfortunately, this exact style flew off the shelves as soon as Harper was spotted in it, but luckily there are plenty of options to help you dress up your little darlings. This Fendi number in particular is just too cool for school.

The Peter Pan collared dress, which costs £185, has  sold out, proving Harper is  a style icon in her own right

Her chic navy coat is a £213 design by Monnalisa, described on the brand's website as a 'beautifully tailored coat made from a thick, mini waffle textured viscose that has a super soft backing.'

'This is a perfect coat for any special occasion or simply worn over an everyday outfit,' adds the site.

According to HarperBeckhamFashion.blogspot.co.uk, Harper's hat, red and beige colourblock turtleneck and boots are all from the upcoming AW15 Chloe collection.

Want to dress your child like Harper? Sadly, without two of the world's most famous parents, you can't, because the collection doesn't even land in stores until June.

At the start of the month, the youngster  wore a faux fur hooded coat from Chloe's AW14 collection while on a walk around London with her father, accessorised with £145 Chief boots by Stella McCartney

At the start of the month, the youngster championed Chloe once more. She wore a faux fur hooded coat from the French brand's AW14 collection whilst on a walk around London with her father. 

The trendy tot jazzed up the outfit with her favorite £145 Chief boots by Stella McCartney. Other brands she's championed include Little Marc Jacobs, Eliza Eyelet and Billieblush.

'Harper is the ultimate child style chameleon,' said Izabela Minkiewicz, owner of childrenswear store Blue Almonds on Walton Street, London.

'She’s classic, but fun and keeps it real with her finger very much on the fashion pulse. She can carry off everything from a chic LBD to a more traditional printed smock dress or even a football kit.'

She may be the youngest member of the family but Harper has a mind of her own when it comes to getting dressed, her father recently revealed.

'[Harper] gets her outfit ready the night before and then she gets up in the morning, we go down to get her ready and she changes her mind,' the athlete said on The Jonathan Ross Show.

He added:'Then I'm in the room with Harper trying to pick out an outfit and anything which I pick out, which I think looks great, she puts back in.'

Lulu Rayne commented: 'Ever since we were first introduced to Harper Beckham, she's had a style which many adults would aspire to. Her look is girly and effortlessly co-ordinated. She opts for outfits by chic, mainly traditional brands including Burberry and Bonpoint.'

David recently admitted that Harper gets her outfit ready the night before and then she gets up in the morning, they go down to get her ready and she changes her mind

Sharing her tips for copying Harper's look for less, she said: 'Victoria loves to dress Harper in beautiful dresses, which don't need to cost a fortune. 

'They can be finished off with a simple cardigan or a chic cape, which can be used to accessorise any number of outfits. Finish the look off with an adorable bow for the top knot.'

Isabel Garreton, founder and designer of her eponymous childrenswear line which is loved by the likes of Sarah Jessica Parker’s children, added: 'Harper is definitely informed by her mother’s sense of style and commitment to elegance; think simple lines, good fabrics'

Another toddler hogging headlines is Kim and Kanye West's daughter, North. Lulu believes that Harper wins the battle of the trendiest tots, though. 

She said: 'I think it's a shame that Kim and Kanye dress North West exclusively in black and dark colours. Little girls love to wear colour and it doesn't have to be the traditional gawdy pinks. For SS15 there are lots of great citrus colours for girls, I particularly love the colour palette from Roksanda Blossom's SS15 collection, which contains lots of yellow and orange. 

'These colours would look great on North West so let's see some colour, Kimye!'

Lulu thinks it's a shame that Kimye dress North West exclusively in black and dark colours. 'Little girls love to wear colour and it doesn't have to be the traditional gawdy pinks,' she said
