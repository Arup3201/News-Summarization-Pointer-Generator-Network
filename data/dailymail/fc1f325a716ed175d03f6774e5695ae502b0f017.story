Steven Gerrard has fuelled speculation that he will return to Liverpool at some point in the future, by admitting that managing the club is 'a big dream' of his.

The Liverpool captain, who has been at the club for his whole career, will leave Anfield at the end of the season to play for MLS side LA Galaxy, but refused to rule out the possibility of a return to his boyhood club in a managerial capacity.

'I still see myself as a player, and I know how tough it is to be a manager,' Gerrard told ITV ahead of the Reds' Europa League last 32 clash with Besiktas.

'Who knows [if I'll become Liverpool manager]? It is obviously a big dream of mine, but you have to be good enough first and foremost. It's not just about saying you want to be a manager or you are going to be a manager.' 

Gerrard's comments came in reaction to a Daniel Sturridge interview, in which the England striker remarked that he is sure Gerrard will manage the club in his lifetime.

It is a view that many Liverpool supporters hold, due to Gerrard's affiliation with the club throughout his entire life.

Continuing, 34-year-old Gerrard remarked: 'If you want to be a manager, you have to go out and prove yourself. It's a long way away, I've still got a few years left to play and that is my main focus at the moment.'
