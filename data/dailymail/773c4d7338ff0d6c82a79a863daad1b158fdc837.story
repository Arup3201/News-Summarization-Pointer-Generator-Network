'Exceptional officer': Captain James Townley, 29, was found dead in a toilet cubicle just a week after being deployed at a base in the Nad-e Ali district

An army officer who was found dead in a toilet block in Afghanistan with gunshot wounds to his head, placed himself under a lot of pressure to succeed, an inquest has heard.

Captain James Townley, 29, from Glastonbury, Somerset, had a first class degree and was described as an 'exceptional officer' who was 'unbelievably clever'.

But an inquest in Wells heard that Oxford Graduate Cpt Townley was like a 'coiled spring' who put himself under immense strain.

He was found dead the day before his 30th birthday and only a week into his deployment at the Shawqat base in the Nad-e Ali district.

Three empty bullet cartridges were found on the floor of the the cubicle next to a pistol.

Colleagues said it was unlikely his death was an accident or that enemy action was involved.

His room mate, Captain Christopher Finbow, said Cpt Townley got up unusually early and left their tent at around 6.30am on 21 September 2012.

Cpt Finbow did not hear gunshots but entered the toilet and shower block one minute and 56 seconds later to find blood coming from inside the third cubicle.

He told the inquest: 'At the time I made the assumption that someone had shot themselves or had suffered a nasty accident.

'There was blood on the floor which was coming from inside the cubicle. I hadn’t heard anything to concern me - I definitely hadn’t heard gunfire.'

Colleagues used a knife to unlock the door and found Cpt Townley sitting on the toilet but slumped to the floor with gunshot wounds to the head.

He was found with a Sig Sauer 9mm pistol - a weapon which soldiers would carry with them at all times.

Up to three empty bullet cases were on the floor of the cubicle and there was a bullet hole in the wall, the inquest heard.

Just three minutes and 18 seconds after Townley had entered the block he was on a stretcher, en route to the base’s medical centre.

Medics battled to save the officer’s life but he was later pronounced dead at Camp Bastion, Helmand Province.

Cpt Townley’s colleagues told the inquest that they did not know him well as he had only recently been posted to Shawqat operating base.

Treatment: Captain Townley was pronounced dead at Camp Bastion. Doctors tried desperately to save him but he died a short time later

However, there was nothing to suggest an underlying issue.

Regiment Sergeant Major Andrew Faupel of the Corps of Royal Engineers said: “He came across as quiet and reserved.

'From what I could see James put himself under a lot of pressure to do a good job.

'He was trying to do a good job, and do the job to the best of his ability. He was a coiled spring.

'But I don’t know much about him and I’m not sure whether that behaviour was normal.'

His colleagues told the court it was unlikely his death would have been an accident.

Lieutenant Timothy Barker said: 'You need a conscious, positive thought to discharge the weapon, it is not something that could be done by accident.

'I believe it was a self-inflicted gun-shot wound. I did not think it was a green on blue threat, which is where rogue members of Afghan security take out British troops.'

'Unbelievably clever': The Oxford graduate, who also worked as a tax associate at Pricewaterhouse Cooper, had only been at the base for a week

Captain Duncan Fraser added: 'At the evening briefing James was asked questions by the commander.

'He appeared to be hesitant and he was swallowing a lot more than you would usually expect a person to.'

Cpt Townley, of 28 Engineer Regiment, had a first class degree in engineering and computer science from Oxford University

He worked as a tax associate for Pricewaterhouse Coopers before attending the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst.

The five-day inquest continues.
