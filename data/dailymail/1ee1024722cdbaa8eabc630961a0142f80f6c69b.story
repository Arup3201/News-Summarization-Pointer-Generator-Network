City trader Robin Clark has said he thought he was going to die after he was shot as he got out of a car at Shenfield railway station, in Essex

The City trader dubbed the 'Wolf of Shenfield' has described how he said a prayer as he thought he was going to die after being shot in the leg while on his way to work.

Robin Clark is currently under armed guard in hospital while he is treated for a serious leg injury.

The 44-year-old was shot by a man in a balaclava as he got out of his friend's car at Shenfield railway station, in Essex, at about 5.45am on Friday.

Speaking to The Sun from his hospital bed, Mr Clark has described the moment he was shot.

He said: 'I put my hand over the wound and felt a reasonable amount of blood come out.

'I said a quick prayer because I thought this was going to be the end.

'I thought I was going to bleed to death before any help would come.'

Mr Clark said he could not think of why anybody would have attacked him, ruling out links to money or relationships.

British Transport Police, who have made no arrests in the case, interviewed Mr Clark yesterday after letting him recover from his injuries.

Detective Superintendent Gary Richardson today said: 'We are continuing our investigation into the incident at Shenfield rail station on Friday, 24 January and are currently pursuing several lines of enquiry.

'I can confirm we have now interviewed the victim at some length. This has provided us with a number of investigative leads. He currently remains in hospital.

'Officers have undertaken a range of enquiries in relation to this investigation, including liaising with local police, interviewing witnesses, and conducting visits to the railway station.

'We will be carrying out another 
return visit to the railway station on Friday morning, one week after 
the attack, during which we will be distributing information to 
commuters in an attempt to identify anyone who might be able to assist 
the enquiry.'

Just days 
before the shooting, Mr Clark hinted that he was in financial trouble as
 he shared a message on Twitter stating: ‘At what point on a first date 
do you mention you are emotionally unstable and in financial ruin?'

The
 comment – originally made by another Twitter user before being 
retweeted, or forwarded, by Mr Clark – was his penultimate message 
before he was wounded.

Officers have said they have been unable to establish a motive for the shooting so far.

Mr Clark, a twice-divorced father-of-four, last year rented out his £2.2million five-bedroom house in nearby Ingatestone after running into debt.

Also last year, a county court judgment was filed against him for debts of £14,653 and he was director of a number of companies that were shut down while owing money.

Armed officers from Essex Police were scrambled to the scene on Friday while a large section of the car park was taped off

The day before the shooting Mr Clark had tried to sell his Range Rover for £10,000.

He
 is thought to have already sold two Porsches. Luxury car dealer Steve 
Hurn, from Stowmarket in Suffolk, said Mr Clark had been a ‘prolific car
 buyer’ until he went through a ‘messy divorce’ around 18 months ago.

Over the past few years he had bought a number of expensive cars including Lamborghinis, Ferraris and Maseratis.

Mr Hurn said: ‘His great love is classic cars and particularly Porsches. But from what I understand Robin is having a few money difficulties. I think he used to have two Porsches but he had to sell them because he hasn’t got any money.

Former home: Mr Clark had lived in this £2.2million house in the village of Stock, Essex

‘I spoke to him for about ten minutes on 
Thursday about his Range Rover which he wanted me to sell. He wanted to 
get rid of it and said it was sitting on his drive.’

Mr Clark works as a euro derivatives trader at RP Martin, a  brokerage firm in the City of London.

He is reportedly known as the Wolf of Shenfield – after the recent Leonardo DiCaprio film The Wolf of Wall Street – because of his playboy lifestyle.

Affluent Shenfield is 24 minutes by train from central London and is a popular place for City workers to live.
