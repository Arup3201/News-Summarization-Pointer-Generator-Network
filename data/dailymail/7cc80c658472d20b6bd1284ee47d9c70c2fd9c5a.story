The British terrorist dubbed ‘Jihadi John’ has been described as a 'dead man walking' by commentators as the UK's security services seek to track him down and bring him to justice.

But while some experts have suggested he has been identified by MI5 and MI6, his sickening appearance in this ISIS video is a reminder of how much work British agents must do before they bring his reign of terror to an end.

The best hope for eliminating him may come from the skies. Last week it was revealed the US has begun sorties using drones equipped with the latest cameras and weapons over Raqqa in northern Syria – where it is believed ISIS is holding Western hostages.

Search: The hunt for 'Jihadi John' was sparked by the release of the first beheading video in which US journalist James Foley was killed by a man with a London accent

It is hoped footage taken by US drones in northern Syria may help in tracking him down and targeting him

It has also been reported that President Obama would approve an immediate strike on Jihadi John if drone operators reported they had found him.

Intelligence experts are certain to forensically examine the latest video for new clues as to his whereabouts.

On first viewing, the outline of the desert background behind David Haines looks similar to the scene behind Steven Sotloff, the US aid worker whose beheading was also broadcast online by IS.

The video only shows the bleak ground immediately behind them. 

This would suggest that IS has learned from the video of the beheading of US journalist James Foley, where a green plain in the distance was enough to allow computer experts to pinpoint the exact location in the hillsides of Raqqa. 

British and US security forces are said to have been studying the fighter's movement, speech and the weapon he used in a bid to work out who he is

Experts have also called attention to the high level of production in ISIS videos, which use multiple cameras and professional microphones. 

The militant who appears in the David Haines beheading video appears similar to the man who featured in recent clips of US hostages being murdered, a security expert has said.

Raffaello Pantucci, senior research fellow at defence think-tank the Royal United Services Institute, said there were numerous similarities in the films showing the killings of British aid worker Mr Haines and Americans James Foley and Steven Sotloff.

All three open with a media clip of the leader of the hostage's home country - Barack Obama in the first two and David Cameron in the video featuring Mr Haines - before the captive reads what appears to be a prepared message.

In each video the militant is dressed in a similar all-black outfit with only his eyes visible, while all three hostages are seen kneeling in orange boiler suits in what appears to be a desert location.

He speaks with what appears to be a British accent. The apparent killer stands to the left in all of the videos and holds a knife in his left hand.

Mr Pantucci said: ‘They are posed in a very similar way, opening with a message from Obama or Cameron. Then there is the similarity of having the hostage make a false statement to the camera.’

He said he was ‘pretty sure’ the same Islamic State fighter appeared in all three videos.

‘The voice sounds the same,’ he said. ‘He is clearly dressed in the same manner and his stature looks the same. It looks like the same figure. They are clearly setting this person up to be a figure.’

These are in contrast to the grainy, low-definition videos of other terror groups.

It is understood that hundreds of British Special Forces and intelligence-gathering personnel are currently working in the region in an effort to capture Jihadi John.

The operation also involves liaison with Kurdish and Iraqi soldiers. They are using an array of sophisticated equipment to track him down and free other hostages. 

Jihadi John is believed to have travelled to the war-torn country from London over a year ago after becoming radicalised and raising money for the jihadists whilst in Britain.

US authorities believed they had worked out the fighter's position shortly before the first video - showing US journalist James Foley's execution - was released on September 2.

However, the militants had moved on from the camp shortly before American commandoes arrived at the scene.

Security forces drew up a shortlist of possible extremists who could be the murderer after Mr Foley was killed.

Experts then used high-tech analysis of the man in the video's body and voice to try and narrow down the potential suspects.

Britain's Ambassador to the U.S. Peter Westmacott has told CNN that security services in Britain and the US are pumping huge resources into finding out who he is and where he is hiding.

He said: 'We're putting a lot into it. And there are some very sophisticated technologies, voice identification and so on, which people can use to check who these people are.'

The masked man, who speaks with a clear London accent, has appeared in two chilling videos showing him beheading American journalists and issuing threats to President Obama.

The videos have been filmed in barren desert, but experts have gleamed some clues to the group's location

The same killer is thought to have appeared in the first two films - in which James Foley and Steven Sotloff (pictured) were killed, and authorities will now analyse the latest video in a bid to find further clues

He was at first suspected to be Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, the so-called 'hip hop jihadist' who left his £1million home in Maida Vale to join Islamist militants fighting for the ISIS in Syria.

However, earlier this month, officials appeared to rule out Abdel Bary as the killer and focused their attention on another man, whose name has not yet been released. 

They are reportedly confident they have worked out the fighter's identity using high-tech analysis of his body and voice and do not believe it to be Abdel Bary.

European hostages freed earlier this year have identified the man as being one of three jailers they dubbed 'The Beatles', who guarded them and oversaw torture and mock executions.

The militants are thought to be in northern Syria, hiding in the swathe of the Middle East now under ISIS control

During extensive 'debriefings' with intelligence officers, the hostages were shown pictures of suspected UK and other European jihadists.

The former captives are understood to have been able to recognise around eight Britons they had 'come into contact' with during their months of captivity in a dozen locations around Syria.

The Daily Mirror reported earlier this week that MI5 had identified a prime suspect and was on the verge of arresting known associates still believed to be in the UK.

The latest video of Mr Haines' execution will however raise fears that - despite two weeks having passed since the first execution video was released - the killer still appears to be able to carry out further killings.
