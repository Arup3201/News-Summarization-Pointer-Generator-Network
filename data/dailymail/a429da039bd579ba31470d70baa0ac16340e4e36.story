The manuscript of Joey Barton’s long-awaited autobiography has been delivered to publishers Michael Joseph ahead of an August launch.

The Barton life story had been due for release in spring 2013 but was delayed for more than a year because the QPR midfielder was allegedly not satisfied with the chapters written by his first ghost writer, award-winning sports journalist Matthew Syed.

This is despite Barton tweeting to his 2.46million followers how much he enjoyed book meetings with his ‘friend’ Syed, a former British No 1 table tennis player and an expert on the psychology of sport.

It seemed an ideal partnership with Barton starting a philosophy degree at Roehampton University.

But it’s understood Barton felt there was too much of Syed’s style in the first draft leading to another ghost writer working with the footballer, who tweeted on Tuesday: ‘Can’t wait for my book.’

Barton has promised a tell-all tome, threatening when Syed started work on the project to expose Match of the Day host Gary Lineker, whom he described as an ‘odious little toad, with a vast closet of skeletons’.

Lineker called it ‘scurrilous nonsense’, adding: ‘I had a good look in my closet and only found a few packets of crisps.’

Michael Joseph said only the book would not disappoint while Syed couldn’t comment for ‘contractual reasons.’

Tesco, official supermarket for England’s World Cup campaign in South Africa, have not renewed that deal for Brazil 2014, as well as exiting the FA Skills programme.

The FA need to find a backer for their kids’ scheme at a time £1.6m Sport England funding has been withdrawn for failing to meet participation levels. The FA have put licensed goods in various supermarkets rather than one partner.

MANCHESTER United are prepared to wait until September to secure their next kit sponsorship deal. However, such a late agreement before United’s new kit cycle starts in 2015-16 would mean all replica strips being flown in rather than shipped, reducing United’s profit margins on those likely £90 shirts.

A sign the Premier League are preparing for Barclays not renewing their £120m title sponsorship in two years is that preliminary talks have reportedly taken place with Guinness, who backed the English rugby equivalent for five seasons.

Jose’s Canal+ revenge

Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho, still furious about French network Canal+ filming a private conversation in which he made disparaging remarks about Samuel Eto’o, is making sure he doesn’t speak to the network while in France for Wednesday's Champions League tie against Paris Saint-Germain.

Mourinho is asking every French media representative whether they work for Canal before answering questions. Chelsea say UEFA have sympathy with Jose’s stance, so will not fine him for breaching media regulations.

Got time: Manchester United will wait to reveal their new kit sponsorship

No way: Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho will refuse to speak to Canal+ while in Paris

Former England cricket chief Andy Flower, now technical director of elite coaching, is not even the most senior member of that ECB department.

His boss is Gordon Lord, head of elite coaching development, which begs the question why Flower was kept on the payroll after the Ashes debacle with his presence sure to complicate life for his successor.

Meanwhile, the ECB say it is ‘right and proper’ for Lord, the former Warwickshire batsman, to be in the interview group picking the new England head coach because he helped to pick Flower.

Football reporter Jeremy Butler has become Tranmere Rovers’ new chief executive. Butler will now be buying and selling rather than  writing about deals such as Manchester United signing Lionel Messi last June — described by one website as the worst transfer story ever.

Franz Beckenbauer has opted out of UEFA and FIFA politics but continues as global ambassador for Russian energy giant Gazprom, the Champions League sponsors. Gazprom are ‘unable to share details of the agreement’ but informed sources say it is worth €5m a year to the Germany legend.
