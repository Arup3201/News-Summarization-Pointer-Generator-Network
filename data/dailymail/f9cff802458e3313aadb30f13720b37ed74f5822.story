Troubled: Richie Incognito has been admitted to a psychiatric unit, according to reports

Disgraced former Miami Dolphins player Richie Incognito has been involuntarily admitted to a psychiatric facility following a string of bizarre outbursts, according to reports.

Incognito, who has been named as the ringleader of a bullying culture within the Miami Dolphins, went to the facility in Arizona late on Thursday night - just hours after confessing to smashing up his own Ferrari with a baseball bat.

TMZ Sports reported that the trip to the unit came after an emotional conversation with a friend, in which they agreed that the stress of the NFL investigation and Incognito's parents' divorce was taking its emotional toll on him.

Incognito concluded that he needed help but they realized they were too drunk to drive to the hospital - so called police and asked to be taken there, TMZ reported.

But once at the hospital, Incognito reportedly had second thoughts and asked to leave - however, an involuntary commitment order was secured and he is still being held there, awaiting an evaluation.

The police would not confirm the latest developments on Friday morning.

On Thursday morning, the 30-year-old former linesman reportedly took a baseball bat to his $300,000 car in a fit of rage.

When MyFoxPhoenix asked
 him about the damages on Thursday, he said: 'Oh that was that was just 
me venting, that was self expression, that's a piece of art.

'The happiest day of my life was when I got that car and now the second happiest day will be when I donate it to charity.'

Police had gone to Incognito's home in Scottsdale after a neighbor called to report the damage, including dents to the hood and half a baseball bat sticking out from its grill.

When
 officers arrived, they found Incognito and the car were missing. When 
they later called to ask if he wanted to report a crime, he confessed 
that he did the damage himself.

The attack, first reported by TMZ, is just the latest bizarre outburst by Incognito, who was suspended from the Dolphins on November 3 following allegations that he led a bullying ring that forced tackle Johnathan Martin to leave.

On Friday a report was released which named him as the ringleader within the Dolphins' locker room, prompting a Twitter rant from Incognito that he couldn't be defined 'in 144 years let alone 144 pages'.

He also criticised former teammate Martin, saying the report would 'bury' the claims against him.

However, on Monday and Tuesday night 
he returned to the social networking site to 'apologize for acting like a
 big baby the last few days'.

He added: 'This has all been so much on 
me and my family. I just want to play football.'

Incognito also changed tack with Martin by calling him his 'brother' and saying 'no hard feelings'.

Last week, after a report was published naming Incognito as the figurehead of the alleged bullying ring, Incognito launched into a Twitter rant before apologising to teammates and coaches

Last week, the investigation into the racially charged Miami Dolphins bullying scandal detailed widespread harassment in the team's locker room that extended beyond the two players at the centre of the probe.

The NFL-ordered report stated there was a 'pattern of harassment' committed by at least three players and extended to two lineman and an assistant trainer, all targets of vicious taunts and racist insults.

Lawyer Ted Wells released the report, saying guard John Jerry and center Mike Pouncey followed Richie Incognito's lead in harassing Jonathan Martin, who left the team in October.

They threatened to rape his sister, called him a long list of slurs and bullied him for not being 'black enough.

Incognito's attorney, Mark Schamel, released a statement calling Wells' report 'replete with errors' and said Martin 'was never bullied by Richie Incognito or any member of the Dolphins' offensive line.'Â
