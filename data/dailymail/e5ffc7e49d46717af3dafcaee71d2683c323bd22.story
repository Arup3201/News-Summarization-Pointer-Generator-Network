A two-year-old boy has lost part of his finger after being caught in a check-out gate at a Tesco store.

The toddler, who has not yet been named, was airlifted to hospital after the incident at Tesco Metro in Swindon, Wiltshire, yesterday.

Police, fire and ambulance crews attended at around 3pm before the boy was airlifted to Frenchay Hospital in Bristol.

Shoppers watched as he was carried to the helicopter which had landed in a nearby road before making the 40-mile trip to Bristol.

A spokesman for South Western Ambulance Service said: ‘We received a call shortly after 3pm on Thursday to reports of a child being injured at the Tesco store in Swindon.

‘An ambulance was dispatched along with two rapid response teams, one of which was from the Wiltshire Air Ambulance team.

‘At the scene the child was in pain and distressed but behaving very well considering the situation. He was given pain relief and later taken to Frenchay Hospital by air.

‘He has suffered a partial loss of one of his fingers.’

It is believed a worker accidentally trapped the boy's finger while closing a check-out gate at the branch in Swindon, although the exact cause is not yet known.

The toddler, who has not yet been named, was airlifted to Frenchay Hospital in Bristol after the incident yesterday afternoon

The store was shut for several hours while the child was treated and an investigation was carried out.

A Tesco spokesman said: ‘We were very sorry to hear about the accident that took place in our store earlier today and we are doing all we can for the boy and his family.

‘As a precaution we have removed the checkout barriers in the store while we conduct a thorough investigation.’

John Ainslie, 41, of Swindon, who arrived at the scene just after the incident, said the check-out barriers were an ‘accident waiting to happen’.

The toddler was treated for his injuries, which includes the partial loss of one of his fingers, at Frenchay Hospital in Bristol

He said: ‘When I got there the paramedics were treating the child and the woman with him was clearly very upset. I obviously hope the boy is okay as I have child myself.

‘I have said for some time it was an accident waiting to happen.

‘When you are designing these barriers you have to take into account the worst case scenario. Hopefully, this will force them to change.’

A Wiltshire Police spokesman said: ‘We were called out to assist the paramedics in carrying out their treatment of the child.

‘We helped them to land the helicopter and later getting the child into the ambulance.'
