A rude grandmother who unleashed a flurry of insults at her neighbour after he trimmed one of her hydrangea plants has been given a community order.

Foul-mouthed Margaret Perry, 87, branded her Irish neighbour a 'menace' and told him he should go back to his own country during a 20-minute rant in Cheam, Surrey.

She screamed 'b**** up your a***' and told Brian Kelly that he could not speak 'proper English' after losing her temper.

Rant: Margaret Perry, 87, told the magistrate today 'this is all bloody ridiculous' as she was sentenced

The grandmother, who admitted harassment at an earlier hearing, was today given a six month community sentence.

When asked if she had anything to say, 
Perry told chief magistrate Keith Sillitoe: 'This is all bloody 
ridiculous, it is a waste of my time, and a waste of yours.'

Mr Kelly claimed he was merely cutting the 
plant back after it had grown into his garden and said it was blocking the 
sunlight from his tomatoes.

But Perry lost her temper when she saw him in her garden trimming her 'pride and joy', Croydon Crown Court heard.

By talking to Mr Kelly, the grandmother had breached a restraining order imposed last year after she had stolen one of his plant pots.

Perry pleaded guilty to harassment in
March, but since then, the court heard how she had thrown a toilet roll
into next door’s garden.

During the hearing, the court gave Perry permission to stand next to prosecutor Terry Curtis because she is hard of hearing.

Mr Curtis told magistrates: 'The 
victims, who are elderly themselves, feel Mrs Perry is motivated in her 
harassment by racial prejudice.'

In sentencing Perry to a six month 
community order and ordering the former Greater London Council employee 
to pay £75 in costs, chief magistrate Keith Sillitoe, said: 'We have 
dealt with you as leniently as we can Mrs Perry. You must not contact 
them again or you will find yourself back in here.'

Perry also threatened to cut her 
neighbour’s internet cable which she had confused for a water pipe, 
Croydon magistrates’ court heard in March.

The grandmother, a former Greater 
London Council employee, denied shouting abuse at her neighbour, but 
admitted asking him what he was doing to her hydrangea, thereby 
breaching the order.
