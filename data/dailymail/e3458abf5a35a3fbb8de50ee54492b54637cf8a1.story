A man has been charged with the murder of his 17-year-old neighbour more than 30 years after the high school student was found dead in a ditch.

Kenneth Lee Hicks, now 49, was a neighbour of Lori Billingsley at the time of her death in Oregon in October 1982. The teenage girl had been beaten, stabbed, strangled and sexually assaulted.

At the time police had insufficient evidence to arrest Hicks - who was the last person to see Miss Billingsley alive and a prime suspect in the case - but this week saw him charged with aggravated murder following advances in DNA technology.

Cold case: Kenneth Lee Hicks, now 49, has been arrested over the murder of his then neighbour, high school student Lori Billingsley, in Oregon in October 1982

Hicks, of St Helens, was 19 when Miss Billingsley's body was found in a drainage ditch in Aloha, west of Portland. He pleaded not guilty to the charge yesterday, according to a Fox News report.

Sergeant Bob Ray, from the Washington County Sheriff's Office, said evidence from the case had been submitted to the Oregon State Police Crime laboratory in 1991 as DNA was beginning to gain recognition as an investigative tool. But assessments yielded nothing concrete and the murder remained unsolved.

In December 2010, retired sheriff's office detective Mike O'Connell returned to work on a part time basis and began looking into the 1982 murder. He went on to serve a search warrant to obtain Hicks' DNA in April last year.

This led to Hicks' arrest on Wednesday, said Sgt Ray, who added that the work of the officer leading the investigation at the time of Miss Billingsley's death, the late Detective Jim Welch, had been 'invaluable' to the officers re-examining the case.

'The DNA was just the last piece of the puzzle,' he said.

District Attorney Robert Hermann is set to act as prosecutor in the case he was assigned 30 years ago.

The victim's sister Vickie Billingsley claims Hicks was 'infatuated' with her older sibling.

'...She had a big heart, was beautiful and nice,' she told SalemNews.com.
