Fourteen lifeguards who were sacked for making a 'Gangnam Style' spoof video at the California swimming pool where they worked have been rehired.

The young workers, who are mostly students, lost their jobs last month after bosses at the El Monte Aquatic Center labelled their two-minute routine, which comprised synchronised swimming, complicated choregrography and plenty of hip-thrusting, 'inappropriate and disgusting.'

But the lifeguards should soon be back at work after the El Monte City Council voted on Tuesday to rehire the workers pending a review of the leisure centre's management and procedures.

Spoof: Fourteen Californian lifeguards who were fired from a city pool in El Monte, California, after making a racy parody of a pop song have been rehired

In a 3-2 vote, council members 
approved a recommendation made by Mayor Andre Quintero to direct Interim
City Manager Dayle Keller to rehire the group, according to the San Gabriel Valley Tribune.

The lifeguards clearly put a lot of work into the video, which was a spoof version of a Korean rapper’s music clip. 

But their bosses did not appreciate their efforts and all 14 lifeguards were fired on September 5.

Lifeguard Style, the two-minute video is a parody of pop star Psy’s 
Gangnam Style music video.

It became the unexpected internet sensation 
of the summer, clocking up more than two million views on YouTube in 
just three months.

In the hilarious spoof, red swimsuit-clad lifeguards and their young male colleagues strut their stuff, mimic Psy's dance moves and rub sun cream into each other.

One clip in the video shows a man straddling another male lifeguard in an elevator while giving some impressive hip thrusts.

But rather than being amused or entertained by the film, the lifeguards’ superiors 'said the entire video was inappropriate and disgusting,' fired lifeguard Gabriel Gonzalez told NBC.

The city claim that the group were fired for using city property, the pool and their uniforms, for private use.

All but one of the lifeguards are college students who were working at the pool to raise money before going back to school.

Desperate for their jobs back, the group set up a Facebook page 'Bring Back The El Monte Aquatic Center 14,' which has attracted more than 17,360 'likes' and they managed to get almost as many signatures on a petition.

'We just felt it was really unfair and not really grounds for termination,' former lifeguard Alexander Huerta told CBS.

Another fired lifeguard, Juliet Gilek, told the TV station he was stunned when he heard the news.

'I was in shock. Because I really didn't think that it would escalate to termination,' he said.

'I loved what I did. I loved teaching the kids. I loved making sure everybody was safe. So I would never have wanted to hurt the pool in any way. This was just a fun thing to capture our memories with.'

The Californian lifeguards' jobs are no longer on shaky ground, and Psy’s music career is similarly going from strength to strength.

His music video, in which he performs his now signature horse riding move, became an internet hit attracting 117 million on YouTube since its July release and Psy recently attended the VMA's.

Psy - real name Park Jae Sung - was the first Korean artist to be invited to the industry event since 2005.

His undeniably catchy song was meant as a commentary on the rampant materialism and emphasis on appearance of today's South Korea - particularly in relation to Gangnam, which Psy terms Seoul's Beverly Hills.

While Psy has won millions of YouTube hits, the lifeguards' spoof video has impressively garnered more than 74,000.
