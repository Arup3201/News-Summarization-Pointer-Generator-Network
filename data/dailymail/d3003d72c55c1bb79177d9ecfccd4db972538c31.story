A North Carolina restaurant with a 'no concealed firearms' sign on the door has found itself in the midst of a political firefight after it was robbed by three thugs with pistols this week.

The Pit Authentic Barbeque in Durham, North Carolina, is getting heaps of criticism from pro-gun advocates who claim that the robbery on Sunday night is proof that banning law-abiding citizens from having weapons means that only criminals will be armed.

Police say three men entered the restaurant through the back door and forced all the employees to lay down on the ground.

Two of the employees were assaulted during the jostling to subdue them, WTVD reports. Police said they injuries were minor.

Several customers were in the dining room, but waiters were able to get them out the front door quickly and none of them were harmed.

Surveillance video shows the robbers wearing masks and black hoodies as they point pistols at the employees in the kitchen.

The three suspects ran off with cash and are still at large.

Owner Greg Hatem has offered a $2,000 reward for information leading to their capture.

'We take this very seriously. We want to make sure our guests and our staff are taken care of,' he told WTVD. 

Sean D. Sorrentino, who writes An NC Gun Blog, published a photo with a sign on the front door of the restaurant that says 'No weapons' and 'No concealed firearms.'

He says the policy ensured that his employees were at the mercy of the armed robbers.

Several customers were inside at the time, but they were safely shuffled out of the restaurant

'No one could resist them. Why? Because the owner of The Pit Authentic Barbecue has banned guns in his restaurant,' Sorrentino writes.

The owner, he added, 'went out of his way to make custom signs to make sure we gun owners felt unwelcome.'

The restaurant's Facebook page has since been flooded with negative reviews by gun owners who criticize the no concealed weapons policy.

'You INVITED those robbers with the sign you posted... Good job victimizing yourselves. I hope you appreciate the reality check and open up your eyes,' wrote Nicholas Rodgers.

Facebook user Robert Tillman said: 'No gun/weapon signs only give criminals confidence that they can get away with their behaviors without resistance. I for one will never set foot in any place, buisness or other wise with a sign in the window prohibiting lawful cary of any weapon (sic).'

The owners of The Pit did not respond to the MailOnline's request for comment on Thursday night.
