Michael Owen-owned Brown Panther will attempt to banish memories of a painful Canadian experience by running at the Breeders' Cup fixture at Santa Anita.

The Tom Dascombe-trained stayer was withdrawn from the Canadian International at Woodbine on Sunday after he unseated jockey Richard Kingscote on the way to the start.

Brown Panther will get the chance to set the record straight in the Breeders' Cup Turf, for which he will be ponied down to the starting gates, on Saturday week.

Owen also confirmed that the six-year-old entire will remain in training next season.

He told Racing UK: 'The track is not ideal, the trip is not ideal and that downhill start won't be ideal.

'He's a blooming good horse and I want him to continue next season.

'I might never have a horse like this again.'
