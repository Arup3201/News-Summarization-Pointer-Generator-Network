As a society, we've become used to May to September relationships - just look at Madonna and her latest backing dancer; Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones and their 25-year age gap. No one bats an eyelid any more.

But one 'exteme toy boy' does raise a few eyebrows when he steps out with his lover - because baby-faced Kyle Jones, 31, is in a relationship with a 91-year-old great-grandmother.

Kyle, from Augusta, Georgia, dates numerous pensioners at the same time and even takes them home to meet his 50-year-old mother. For the last five years he has been in a 'casual' relationship with 91-year-old Marjorie McCool.

Kyle Jones, 31, says he has never dated a woman his own age, shares a tender kiss with Marjorie McCool, 91 at a local park

Kyle, who says says that he always been attracted to older women, has even taken girlfriend Marjorie McCool, 91 (L) home to meet his mother Ceceila Jones (R)

And despite the 60-year age gap, the pair have an active sex life and can't keep their hands off each other.

Kyle said: 'Everyone's brain is wired differently, some guys prefer blondes, some brunettes, some like other guys - I like old ladies.'

The call centre worker was just 18 when he first acted on his attraction for older women and began a sexual relationship with a 50-year-old.

Now Kyle uses dating websites to find women as well as chatting them up in his daily life.

He said: 'Most of the time, the average age I go for is between 60 and 80.

'Whenever I'm trying to speak to an older woman, the first reaction I get is 'you're way too young'.

'I find persistence is good so I tell them it'll be fun.'

Although officially single, Kyle regularly sees up to five women at a time and takes them on dates - and even home to meet his mother.

Despite a 60 year age gap, the couple say they have an excellent and active sex life

In 2009 he met great-grandmother Marge - short for Marjorie - in the bookstore where she was working and asked for her number.

Marge, who had been single for 37 years since splitting with the father of her six children, agreed to go on a date.

She said: 'In the beginning I got jealous of his other women but he keeps coming back to me and tells me I'm the best.

'The physical side of our relationship is wonderful. I amaze myself, he amazes me. There's nothing better.

Kyle mother Ceceila, (R) says she has realised that her sons preference for older women like Marjorie (L) is more than a phase

'I wear sexy outfits to bed. I try to keep my bra on though because I don't have much left.

'My family consists mostly of boys, and they don't really care - what I do is my business.

'Their ages are 71, 63, 61, 52 and 50.

'When people see us out together they probably think that he's my son, or maybe even a grandson. I have grandsons older.'

And while many of the women he dates can't believe such a young man would find them attractive, Kyle is adamant he does.

He said: 'Often, the things women are so self-conscious about is what I'm into. I like the neck lines and wrinkles.

'Women worry about their boobs sagging but I think the natural hang looks great. I'm really not a fan of plastic surgery.

'I don't like to say gray, I'm a fan of platinum hair. I prefer it natural.'

However, due to his girlfriends' advancing years, most of his relationships face a limited future.

He said: 'Perhaps I would like to meet the right person and settle down, but I know they would die before me.'

Kyle's preference for the elderly has drawn criticism from those who see him as opportunistic.

He said: 'The most common criticism I hear is 'you're after money' or 'you're after inheritance'.

'Or people think these women must be buying me things.

'But it's not true at all - I do this because I like it and they like it too. I've dated women from various ends of the financial spectrum, but it's never about what they have.'

Kyle's mother, Ceceila Jones Clark, 50, initially thought it was a phase her son was going through.

She said: 'I think a lot of children have crushes on their teachers, so it didn't strike me as strange.

'I really wasn't sure if that was something that he was going to stay with or if it was just a cougar phase some young men go through.

'However, later when I saw the kind of women he was spending time with I knew it wasn't a phase.'
