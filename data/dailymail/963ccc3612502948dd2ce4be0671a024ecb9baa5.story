Education Secretary Michael Gove yesterday faced a growing backlash over plans to drop US literary classics from new English Literature GCSEs.

To Kill A Mockingbird and Of Mice And Men are among the American novels being ditched by an exam board as well as Arthur Miller’s play, The Crucible, amid government reforms.

The OCR exam board said the decision was due to Mr Gove’s desire for the exam to be ‘more focused on tradition’ as well as fewer opportunities to include such texts on the new British dominated syllabus.

However, the decision has sparked a storm of protest, with complaints trending on Twitter and thousands of people signing online petitions to keep American classics on GCSE syllabuses.

Anger: Education Secretary Michael Gove yesterday faced a growing backlash over plans to drop US literary classics, such as To Kill A Mocking Bird from new English Literature GCSEs

Authors, academics and booksellers have condemned the shake-up, with some describing it as ‘backward-looking’ and a traditionalist attempt to reinstate the idea of a ‘canon’ of English literature.

The Department for Education has insisted that its document about content for the subject, published in December, ‘doesn’t ban any authors, books or genres’.

The new GCSE course will include at least one play by Shakespeare, at least one nineteenth century novel, a selection of poetry since 1789 including representative Romantic poetry and ‘fiction or drama from the British Isles from 1914 onwards’.

Exam boards can add extra books, but experts have pointed out that the rules leave very left little room for 20th century writing outside Britain.

Of Mice And Men, the classic novel by John Steinbeck, has also been dropped

Referring to new specifications, Paul Dodd, OCR’s head of GCSE and A-level reform, said in an interview: ‘Of Mice and Men, which Michael Gove really dislikes, will not be included.

‘It was studied by 90 per cent of teenagers taking English literature GCSE in the past. Michael Gove said that was a really disappointing statistic.’

Speaking yesterday, Mr Dodd said the Department for Education ‘restrictions’ mean there is ‘no room for texts such as Of Mice and Men or To Kill a Mocking Bird’ any more.

He added: ‘The essential thing is that in the new GCSE English Literature you cannot do fiction or drama from 1914 unless it is British.’

A series of online petitions have been launched in protest. One, signed by 2,567 people already, states that: ‘Modern texts from outside the UK are equally, if not more, important as British texts.’

Children’s Laureate, Malorie Blackman, retweeted a newspaper story on the controversy, saying: ‘Surely diversity in the curriculum is vital to encourage more extended reading and to expand our teens’ minds?’

She said her 18-year-old daughter had described To Kill A Mockingbird as a book that ‘kids should be reading’.

In a blog, children’s author, Alan Gibbons, said that To Kill a Mockingbird’s themes of racism, prejudice and difference are ‘highly relevant’ to today’s children.

He added: ‘There should be a balance of pre-20th century texts and more modern ones and this balance should reflect the breadth of writing in English, with US, Canadian, African, Indian and other writers present.’

Another author, Marcus Sedgwick, who has been nominated for the prestigious Carnegie Medal for children’s literature, also attacked the move.

Referring to Mr Gove, he told teenagers on Twitter to ‘march up to your parents right now, show them this (story) and demand they vote this man out of office’.

Meanwhile Waterstones in Braehead, Glasgow tweeted: ‘Don’t be alarmed if we put your copy of To Kill A Mockingbird in a brown bag today. We hear Michael Gove might be doing spot checks.’

It said that copies of The Crucible had been relocated to its ‘irony’ section.

Bethan Marshall, a senior lecturer in English at King’s College, London, and chairwoman of the National Association for the Teaching of English, described the new syllabus as being ‘out of the 1940s’.

She said: ‘Kids will be put off doing A-level literature by this.’

A DfE spokesman said: ‘In the past, English Literature GCSEs were not rigorous enough and their content was often far too narrow.’

A spokesman for Edexcel said it was still finalising its English Literature GCSE specification and would publish it later this week.
