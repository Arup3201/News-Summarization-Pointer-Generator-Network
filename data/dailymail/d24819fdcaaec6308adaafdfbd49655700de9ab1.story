The England football team is to check in to a 'rundown' hotel overlooking a gun and drug-ridden slum when they arrive in Brazil for next year's World Cup finals.

FA chiefs have been forced to book rooms at the Royal Tulip Hotel in Rio De Janeiro for the team's base after plans to stay in a luxury establishment on glamorous Copacabana Beach fell through.

Despite charging Â£180-a-night, the Royal Tulip has attracted scathing reviews with some guests describing it as 'third world' and others claiming that it 'stinks'.

Slum: Many of the rooms look out over the notorious Rocinha favela - a crime ridden shanty town controlled by ruthless drug gangs

And in 2010 it was the scene of a vicious gun battle between two rival drug gangs in which an innocent bystander was shot and five guests and 30 members of staff were taken hostage.

Many of the rooms look out over the notorious Rocinha favela - a crime ridden shanty town controlled by ruthless drug gangs.

Last year the Brazilian government sent hundreds of police and commandos into Rocinha in an attempt to regain control of the streets prior to next summer's tournament.

In August 2010 the Royal Tulip, then called the Rio InterContinental, was the scene of a 40 minute gun battle between two drug gangs fighting a turf war.

Gangsters, wielding automatic weapons and wearing bullet-proof vests stormed into the hotel foyer taking members of staff and guests hostage.

One witness told the Sunday Mirror: 'It was a shocking incident. It was very nasty even by Brazilian standards.

'They just stormed into the hotel and took it over. The guests were terrified and that poor lady got shot and killed.'

The 418 room, establishment claims to offer four-star luxury and one of the best locations in the city.

But reviews on website Tripadvisor paint a wholly different picture.

One report reads: 'An open sewer outside the place insures that the following is literally true: this hotel stinks.'

Others complain about 'black mould' in the bathrooms, poor hygeine standards and 'horrible customer' service.

It appears to be a far cry from the luxurious establishments England players have stayed at in the past.

In the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, they stayed at a luxury resort in Rustenburg.

And in the 2006 Germany World Cup they enjoyed trendy bars and designer boutiques in Baden Baden
