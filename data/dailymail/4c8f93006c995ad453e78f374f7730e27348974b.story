Members of a Texas hunting club have received death threats over plans to auction off a permit to kill a critically endangered black rhinoceros, despite insisting all the proceeds will go towards conservation efforts.

The FBI is reviewing multiple threats made against members of the Dallas Safari Club which plans to auction the permit granted to them by the African country of Namibia on Saturday.

The club's executive director, Ben 
Carter, said about a dozen threatening messages were sent by email and 
posted on the group's website.

Critically endangered: A Texas hunting club has received death threats 
over plans to auction off a permit to kill a Black Rhino, of which there
 are only an estimated to be 4,000 remaining in the wild

Other messages have been left with club sponsors criticizing support for the organization.

'I've had death threats on my family,' Mr Carter said. 'We've had a number of death threats to our members and (threats about) what would happen if we sell the permit.

The club's executive director, Ben Carter, said about a dozen threatening messages were sent by email and posted on the group's website

'Some crazy stuff,' he said.

FBI spokesman Katherine Chaumont said: 'The
 FBI is aware of the threats,' Chaumont said. 'If a violation of federal
 law is determined, additional action or investigation as necessary will
 take place.'

The auction is being held amid tightened security as part of the club's three-day annual convention in Dallas, which is expected to draw about 45,000 people.Â 

The group announced in October that 
it would auction the permit, one of only five offered annually by 
Namibia. The permit is also the first to be made available for purchase 
outside of that country.

An
 estimated 4,000 black rhinos remain in the wild, down from 70,000 in 
the 1960s. Nearly 1,800 are in Namibia, according to the safari club.

Poachers long have targeted all species of rhino, primarily for its horn, which is valuable on the international black market.

Made
 of the protein keratin, the chief component in fingernails and hooves, 
the horn has been used in carvings and for medicinal purposes, mostly in
 Asia. The near-extinction of the species also has been attributed to 
habitat loss.

Mr Carter
 said the permit could fetch $1 million. But organizers hope to at least
 break the previous high bid for one of the Namibia permits, which is 
$223,000.

Wildlife groups have criticized 
the promotion of a hunt targeting an endangered animal, but Mr Carter said 
it's meant to cull aggressive rhinos in an effort to protect the larger 
herd.

He said the Namibia hunt will focus on an older, nonbreeding male with a pattern of aggression toward other rhinos.

Mr Carter said that wildlife experts say culling a herd is an acceptable habitat management practice.

'When you have the science and facts behind it, and people don't want to listen and just become emotional, you just wonder how people's brains work sometimes,' he said.

Wayne Pacelle, president of the Humane Society of the United States, said culling a herd is acceptable for a population that's abundant, but not for a species on the federal endangered species list.

'We've had a standard for more than 40 years that you don't shoot an animal that's endangered,' he said Wednesday.

Jeffrey Flocken, North American regional director of the Massachusetts-based International Fund for Animal Welfare, also said Wednesday that culling the herd is the wrong approach, given the limited number of black rhinos in existence.

The better approach is to protect the rhino by establishing a secure habitat that welcomes the paying public to view the animal, he said.

'This auction is telling the world that an American will pay anything to kill their species,' Flocken said.

'This is, in fact, making a spectacle of killing an endangered species.'
