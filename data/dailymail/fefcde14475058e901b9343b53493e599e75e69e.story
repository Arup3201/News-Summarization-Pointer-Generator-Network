Storm clouds gathered around Lord’s as gloom enveloped Alastair Cook and an England side who will surely crash to defeat in a second Test the captain could not afford to lose.

Not even the rain that lashed much of London could save Cook as Lord’s remained stubbornly dry but dark and threatening, a reflection of the mood that has taken hold of the England captain and his developing side.

Cook battled so hard to reach 22 off 93 balls and hand England a tantalising glimpse of a successful pursuit of 319 to win this crucial match before he fell in what has become a grimly predictable fashion outside off stump.

It left England, who were looking good at 70 for one, in tatters at 72 for four and Cook with the agonising task of deciding whether he can carry on at the helm of a team in transition he was told to rebuild in his own image.

What a pickle England will be in if an India team who have not won abroad for three years go on to take the last six wickets and claim a 1-0 lead with three to play in this Investec series.

India have won just one of their 16 Tests at Lord’s before now and only five Tests anywhere in England, a reflection of the travel sickness that should have made them perfect opponents for the ‘new’ England.

That is how bad defeat here would be but there remains no appetite within the ECB nor among his team for Cook to stand down now. Not after England have invested so much in him in the wake of an Australian disaster that claimed so many high-profile English casualties. 

The ECB believe that Cook and Peter 
Moores are creating the culture and environment for young players to 
flourish they wanted post-Ashes and that it is the senior men who are 
letting the captain down at the worst possible time.

Only
 if Cook falls on his sword ahead of next Sunday’s third Test will there
 be a sad end to his captaincy now and even if he is inclined to do that
 there will be influential voices who will urge him to fight on.

No-one
 at Lord’s would have believed at the start of this season that England 
would lose in all formats to Sri Lanka and then go one down to India, 
with the captain extending his long run without a century to 27 innings.

Yet
 that will be the sorry scenario unless Joe Root and Moeen Ali 
extend their unbeaten partnership of 32 to the point where the second 
highest successful run chase in England’s history once again comes into 
view.

It is conceivable, with England batting so far down, that they could yet score the 214 runs they still need but this is a team who have forgotten how to win, an England side enduring a run as bad as any suffered in the last 21 years.

Even if Cook and England stand firm and battle on they will still have to accept that this would be the most horrible, embarrassing defeat in conditions that were tailor-made for them once they had won a crucial toss.

England could justifiably claim that their groundsmen, who had provided subcontinental pitches this summer before now, were doing nothing to help them but Mick Hunt gave them the perfect stage here to finally flourish.

This indeed has been close to the perfect Test pitch, with help for the seamers on day one, then decent if challenging batting conditions before spin started to play its part on day four. It is a model every ground should follow.

But that simply exacerbates England’s misery. They did not bowl well enough again on Sunday as India, 145 ahead overnight, were able to move into a position where they would become hot favourites in a compelling Test.

There was hope for England when they took two wickets for one run just ahead of the new ball but once again they allowed the tail to wag vigorously, a stand of 99 for the eighth wicket between Ravindra Jadeja and Bhuvneshwar Kumar leaving the wheels well and truly off England’s wagon.

How painful for England that their tormentor should be Jadeja, the man at the centre of the incident at Trent Bridge that leaves Jimmy Anderson facing a suspension when a preliminary hearing begins via Skype on Tuesday.

The combative all-rounder signalled his intention to attack from the off, and could easily have holed out to Moeen, who was again under-used by Cook, before he settled in to smash 68 from 57 balls that should prove decisive.

Alongside him again was Kumar, who should have been caught by Root on two, a hugely costly miss, but who then went on to score his third half-century of the series from No 9 to add to his six-wicket first-innings haul.

Anderson and Broad, in particular, could 
do little to stem the flow, 66 runs coming in 10 overs after lunch, and 
it would be no surprise if Broad’s badly hurting knee stops him playing 
at the Ageas Bowl. He is woefully short of his best.

It was Jadeja, struck on the helmet by Anderson when he batted, who was again a thorn in England’s side with the ball, trapping Sam Robson on the front foot with his first ball to gain a correct decision that never would have been given before the decision-review system.

Cook and Gary Ballance steadied the ship, helped by some bizarre captaincy from MS Dhoni, until England’s house came tumbling down with those three quick wickets, the captain trudging off to a sympathetic reception from MCC members that is a reflection of the affection he still commands.

The question now is whether that is enough for Cook to ride a storm far greater than the thunder and lightning that rumbled around the home of cricket but refused to come to England’s rescue.
