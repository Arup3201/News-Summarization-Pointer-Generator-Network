Roma boss Rudi Garcia has rubbished claims suggesting he has fallen out with former Chelsea left back Ashley Cole.

Cole has been linked with a move away from the club after finding games hard to come by at the Stadio Olimpico.

The 33-year-old, who joined the Serie A giants  on a free transfer at the end of last season, has not featured in Roma's last four games despite Garcia insisting Cole is an 'important player'.

Cole has found games hard to come by since swapping Chelsea for Roma in the summerÂ 

Garcia, speaking to reporters ahead of Roma's league match against Genoa on Sunday, said: 'I have no problem whatsoever with Cole.

'He remains an important player for us.

'But Jose Holebas is also playing well and helping the team.'

Roma will be hoping to bounce back from their midweek Champions League defeat against Manchester City when they travel to Genoa to try to close the gap on Juventus.
