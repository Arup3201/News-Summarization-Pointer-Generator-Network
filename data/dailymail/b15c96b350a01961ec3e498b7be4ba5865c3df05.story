Three Pennsylvania men kidnapped a 15-year-old girl while she was on her way to her father's house, ripped her clothes off, raped and sodomized her repeatedly as they held her for three days of hell.

Police have charged Eddie A. Johnson, 37, of Philadelphia, and Alfred Kulah, 35, and Mortiman Kesselly, 41, both of Upper Darby, for the unthinkably horrific crime.

The girl told police that the men took her from the street on September 28 and assaulted her repeatedly until the 30th, when she was able to flee and flag down a passing driver.

According to Upper Darby Police Superintendent Michael Chitwood, the men picked up the girl as she was walking along the 6600 block of Upland Street in Southwest Philadelphia.

She had been visiting her father at around 11p.m. when a car pulled over and the three men grabbed her.

'One of the men jumped out of the vehicle and grabbed her by the right arm,' Superintendent Chitwood said to the Daily Times.

'She tried to pull away and they struggled. That’s when a second man got out of the car and the two men grabbed her and put her in the back seat.'

They held her down so she could not see where they were taking her and a half hour later, they brought her into their Long Lane apartment in Upper Darby.

There, the men took turns sodomizing and raping her for three days.

Kesselly was the first to assault the girl, she told police, as Johnson and Kulah undressed her and held her down.

She woke up Saturday morning and Kesselly was in bed next her, she said, and threatened her family.

'He said, "Do your mom look like you? We gonna get her too,"' the police report states. 'The victim began to cry and told him she wanted to go home.'

The men forced her to wear basketball shorts and took her to another house to shower because the apartment's water wasn't working, police said, and fed her at a local McDonald's.

'Once back inside the apartment, Kesselly put her back in the same bedroom. Kulah entered the room and held her down by her arms,' while Kesselly allegedly raped the girl and Kulah took a turn.

'She stated she began to cry and as she was crying, Johnson got on top of her,' the report said. 'She stated that all three repeatedly raped her throughout the night on Saturday.'

On Sunday morning, Kesselly and Kulah assaulted her again, before the three handed her the TV's remote control and left her alone, police said.

'She was able to flee from captivity and flag down a passing motorist who called her father,' Superintendent Chitwood said. 'I can’t imagine the mental and physical angst she felt.'

Her father took her to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia where she was treated for the assault. She reported the rape on Monday.

'Do your mom look like you?

We gonna get her too.'

Alleged rapist, Mortiman Kesselly

With detectives, she was able to locate the Long Lane apartment where the attacks took place and officials found Mortiman and Kulah. A vehicle matching the girl's description was also found, which was registered under Johnson's name.

Officials said they found the girl's underwear as well as 'significant forensic evidence in the apartment that there was an assault.'

The three were charged with rape, statutory sexual assault, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, sexual assault, aggravated indecent assault, kidnapping, unlawful restraint, false imprisonment of a juvenile and assault, according to the District Attorney's office.

They were arraigned on Tuesday and held on $100,000 bond.

The men claim she willingly entered their car and engaged in the activities.
