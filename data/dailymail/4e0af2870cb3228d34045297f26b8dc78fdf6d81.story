An Italian-American’s attempts to pronounce a classic Great British sauce has left close to a million YouTube viewers in stitches.

Pasquale Sciarappa, 75, of New Jersey, started uploading his recipe videos to YouTube in 2008 - wanting his passion for cooking to be experienced by the world, and not just his family.

But his YouTube channel, OrsaraRecipes, really started getting views with his Stuffed Mushroom Recipe - specifically, his attempts to pronounce Worcestershire Sauce.

The Italian chef may be a whizz in the kitchen, but when it comes to pronouncing Worcestershire Sauce he truly struggles.

As Mr Sciarappa battles with the pronunciation, the cameraman can be heard calling different takes, in a bid to capture the chef saying the name of the sauce correctly.

But after struggling for several attempts, Mr Sciarappa resorts to jokingly trying to pronounce Worcestershire Sauce in Italian- suggesting that may be easier.

At the end of the video he can be heard saying: 'I don't what kind of country come this from but I'm Italian, I don't know what to say.' 

Mr Sciarappa’s passion for cooking started back in his native Italy.

‘I started cooking in Torino in 1957 for 12 years. When I came to this country [America], I worked in a restaurant for a few years,’ Mr Sciarappa told MailOnline.

The chef struggles in various outtakes before giving up and asking where on earth the sauce comes from

Citing his mother as his biggest food inspiration, he has shared her love of food and providing for family.

‘She has not only taught me how to cook, but to love cooking and to provide a delicious meal for family and friends,’ he said.

‘Cooking is an everyday thing for me, but since it was only limited to my family, I wanted to spread my love for cooking with the rest of the world through YouTube,’ Mr Sciarappa said.

The latest celebrity chef has a tip on how to make brilliant meals for MailOnline readers: ‘I don’t think it has much to do with secret ingredients. I think it’s more about passion and love for cooking. If you love cooking, you’ll always create a delicious meal!’

His secret for enjoying his time in the kitchen, even at 75: ‘I enjoy a glass or three of vino while I cook.’

The video of Mr Sciarappa trying to pronounce Worcestershire Sauce has been viewed almost 1 million times on YouTube.
