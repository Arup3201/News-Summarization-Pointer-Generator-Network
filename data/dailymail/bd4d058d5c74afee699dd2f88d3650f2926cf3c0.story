When Gus Poyet lost his temper and took out his anger on a cooler box — emptying dozens of drinks bottles and scattering ice on the touchline — it was in protest at so much more than Jack Rodwell’s booking for diving.

The yellow was merely the tipping point which made the Uruguayan see red. Rather, there was frustration at the rapid unravelling of Sunderland’s season and his reputation.

He chose to take it out on Steve Bruce, marching over to the Hull boss in apparent offering of a friendly handshake before sarcastically applauding in his face. Bruce, understandably, reacted and only the intervention of the assistant referee prevented a physical confrontation.

All eyes were on the technical area as the opposing bosses threatened to come together

Poyet had lost his head. Twenty-four hours earlier he had lost star winger Adam Johnson — his four-goal top scorer — after his arrest on suspicion of sexual activity with an underage girl.

He responded by naming four central-midfielders in a 4-4-2 system. It was a bizarre decision which smacked of protest at what he perceives to be a lack of attacking options provided by the club’s hierarchy. That they escaped with a draw was more to do with good fortune, Rodwell’s late equaliser having appeared to go in via his arm.

But there was enough to worry followers of the Black Cats after another insipid display.

As for Poyet’s indiscipline, it soon spread through the team. Lee Cattermole was booked for a blatant kick on David Meyler in the second half and will miss the next two matches. He was substituted moments later. Earlier there had been a reckless lunge by Liam Bridcutt, for which he was lucky not to be sent off and Wes Brown could have seen red for the foul which led to Dame N’Doye’s opener. 

Poyet was sent to the stands for his antics and could face further punishment after the game

Poyet had been vanquished to the stands just before half-time and the concern must now be that Sunderland, too, could be vanquished to the Championship.

The head coach said before the game he was shocked by Sunderland’s involvement at the wrong end of the table.

Perhaps he should take a closer look at the numbers. His team have now won just one in 11 league games and have scored just once in more than eight hours of football.

Poyet talks of implementing his own style of play which will, in the long term, excite supporters.

There is precious little evidence of that offensive brand at present and, Rodwell’s leveller apart, they barely mustered an effort on goal.

The body language of Jermain Defoe told its own story. Dropping deep in an attempt to enjoy a rare feel of the ball as they trailed after the break, he was robbed of possession by one of his own players.

Defoe flapped his hands in dismay. It was yet another show of a side sadly lacking in organisation and discipline.

But when you have a boss who starts with four central-midfield players and is himself sent off just when you need his guidance more than ever, what chance do you stand?

That they got a point had little to do with their absent manager.
