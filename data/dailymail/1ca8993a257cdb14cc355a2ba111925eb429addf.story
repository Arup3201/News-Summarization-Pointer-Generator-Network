Nico Rosberg continues to wind down before returning to Formula One action with Mercedes in 2015 - by enjoying a coastal drive in his classic car.

The 2014 drivers' championship runner-up posted a picture on Twitter showing his Mercedes-Benz 280 SL Pagoda - worth around £80,000 - by a sunny coastal scene on Sunday.

He accompanied the photo of his classic 1970 car with the caption: 'Took a great picture of my amazing car on my sunday cruise... @MercedesBenz #classic #loveit.'

Rosberg will be hoping to go one better in 2015 than he did last season by lifting the drivers' championship

German driver Rosberg was pipped to the 2014 championship by Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton and will be hoping to go one better this campaign.

Speaking in December, the 29-year-old said: 'I look forward to the battle again next year when I will try to be even stronger.

'It's going to be an awesome challenge. Lewis' level is extremely high, and this year Lewis was the best driver on the grid.

'But as we saw in the last race in Abu Dhabi when Williams were right there with us, the competition is strong, and other teams aren't going to be asleep either.

'It's impossible to say now, but we're confident we can keep it up for next season because we have a really strong team at the moment.

'Who knows how strong the opposition is going to be. We all need to wait and see.'

Rosberg gave credit to Hamilton, who won 11 races to the German's five. Despite the acrimony that surfaced between the pair in Monaco and Belgium, Rosberg feels he has learned his lessons.

As to whether he had any regrets, he replied: 'There are things I would do differently, yes of course, that's natural.

'It's often in a difficult experience you grow and learn the most, but regrets, no.

'It's not worth going into details now as to what he would do differently, but all in all it's really been a great year.

'Of course the end result didn't go the way I wanted, but with taking a step back, it's still been such an awesome experience.'
