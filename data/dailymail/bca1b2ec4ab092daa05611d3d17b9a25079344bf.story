One traffic reporter's mission to get a fish sandwich for breakfast was caught live on camera when an anchor cut to his segment as he was ordering at a McDonald's drive-through. 

Jimmy Uhrin, known to his fans as 'Traffic Jam Jimmy', was trying to figure out if it was too early to get a fish sandwich when Baltimore Fox 45 reporter Candace Dold tossed to him in the middle of a live morning newscast.

'Oh Candace, we live?' he asked after suddenly realizing he was on-air. 'Whoops!'

Baltimore Fox 45 traffic reporter Jimmy Uhrin, better known as 'Traffic Jam Jimmy,' was trying to figure out if it was too early to get a fish sandwich when reporter Candace Dold cut to him in the middle of a live segment

He may have been caught off-guard, but Jimmy made sure to still deliver the news - even if it had to be reporting what he could see from the drive-through line. 'I'll tell you folks, stay put, its bad out here,' he said

But Jimmy was quickly unfazed. 

'Hey I've been in the car since four o'clock, I am starving,' he said in the Fox 45 video. 'I'm just getting something really quick.' 

Nothing could stand between Jimmy and his fish sandwich. Except maybe the breakfast menu. 

'Is it too early to get a fish sandwich?' Jimmy asked a drive-through employee, only to be told the fast-food restaurant was solely doing breakfast. 

It would have to be an Egg McMuffin and a black coffee instead for Jimmy - medium-sized please.

He may have been caught off-guard, but Jimmy made sure to still deliver the news to the people - even if it had to be reporting what he could see from the drive-through line.

'I'll tell you folks, stay put, its bad out here,' he said as the camera panned outside his front window to a parking lot covered with snow.

'I've been out since four folks, stay put, trust me.' 

Jimmy, who is such a big fan of McDonald's he had a pillow emblazoned with the logo in his backseat, told Candace not to tell the boss - but said he did not feel guilty about his need to eat.

Jimmy finally did get his fish sandwich. Candace, who was wiping away tears of laughter after his segment, later tweeted that he brought back an entire bag for the office that day

'I didn't know we were coming live, I'm sorry,' he said. 'Anyway I'm hungry. They expect you to work for eight hours in the car, you gotta eat Candace.' 

But Fox 45 general manager Bill Fanshawe said he was happy to see that Jimmy's big personality was translating on air, even if that makes him 'a little nervous at times,' he told the Baltimore Sun.  

'He also has a big heart and truly cares about the community,' said Fanshawe, who pointed out that Jimmy's beard is bright orange in the video because he dyed it for Multiple Sclerosis week.
