With its bone-crunching tackles, and fast-paced action, rugby is one of the world's toughest games.

But trying telling that to grandfather Easton Roy who has pledged to keep on playing - just days after scoring a
try on his ninetieth birthday.

Affectionately known as 
'the oldest winger in town', Mr Roy has played for Stirling County RFC every
week for 60 years.

He was a first team star from 1947 to 1973 and only thought about hanging up his boots after taking part in the prestigious Golden Oldies World Cup in 2008 - at the age of 85.

At the weekend, the superfit granddad turned the clock back to play a match as part of his ninetieth birthday celebrations.

Now he aims to turn out in County's famous red, black and white hoops again.

He said: 'I had a great ninetieth birthday, and the highlight was pulling on my Stirling County strip and playing rugby again.

'I'm limping a bit now, but you have to remember I haven't played since I was 85.

'I keep fit - I've got a gym at home and I go jogging and do yoga, but it's different to playing rugby.

'I wasn't sure I'd last the pace as the other players were younger than me - I played with some of their fathers in the County first team in the 1950s, 60s and 70s.

'But I'd like to play on if I can. After the match I cleaned my boots and washed and pressed my shirt, then packed them back in to my kit bag so they'll be ready.'

Saturday's match at Stirling County's Bridgehaugh home, was arranged after Mr Roy revealed his birthday wish.

He scored his side's try in a 5-5 draw against a team of County players and stalwarts aged from their 20s to 60s.

The former roofer, thought by many to be the world's oldest rugby player, began playing when he joined the RAF during World War Two.

He began his 60-year playing career at Stirling County after he returned home, and starred for the first team for 27 years.

He later played for County's 2nd and 3rd XVs before turning out for the club's 'Wolfhounds' and several other 'old crocks' teams.Â

Fit: Mr Roy trains every morning to keep himself in shape

He was active behind the scenes at County when Scotland international Kenny Logan was starting his career at the club.

Mr Roy, who was also a champion RAF boxer, was a star of the over-35s Golden Oldies World Cup at Murrayfield in 2008.

His team, the Baggy Pipers, took on a side containing Scotland legend and former Lions skipper Gavin Hastings.

The same year he was honoured with a 'local hero' Stirling civic award at Stirling Castle for his contribution to sport.

His daughter Sheila, 58, said today: 'My dad trains every morning and if someone organises another game for him he'll be up for it.

'He's always been very sporty - he was a champion boxer and rower too - but rugby is very much his game. He loves to get together with the boys.'

The Scotland Rugby Union honoured Mr Roy with a public birthday message at half time during Saturday's Six Nations defeat to Wales.

Former Stirling County and Scotland hero Kenny Logan said: 'Easton's a real character at Stirling County.

'When I was in the first team he'd watch me play and speak to me afterwards.

'Everyone at Stirling County knows him, and he's well-loved by young and old.

'I got the chance to play in a game with Easton once, when he was in his seventies.

'I presented him with the Scotland shirt I'd worn against Ireland the previous day as I thought that would be his last game - I never thought he'd still be playing at 90.

'I'll be pleased just to be alive at 90, but he's an inspiration.'
