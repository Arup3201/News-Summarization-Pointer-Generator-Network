Glenn Beck says he was crippled by excrutiating pain from a mystery ailment he has battled for years

Conservative TV and radio host Glenn Beck has revealed he has been battling a serious illness for years.

Beck, 50, says he was crippled by excruciating pain from a mystery ailment that he has been battling for years.

Speaking on TheBlaze, a media network he set up, he said: 'While I was at Fox, the pain would get so bad that my camera crew, our executive producer Tiffany and I, had worked out hand signals so they would know when to take the camera off of me.

'We didn’t know at the time what was causing me to feel as though, out of nowhere, my hands and feet, or arms and legs would feel like someone had just crushed them, set them on fire or pushed broken glass into them.'

On top of this, he had memory problems, vocal paralysis and eyesight trouble. 

He went from medical expert to medical expert but his symptoms confounded them all.

'Most afternoons my hands would start to shake, or my hands and feet began to curl and eventually - if I didn't stop and rest, I began to curl into a foetal position,' Beck said.

'This has baffled some of the best doctors in the world.

'It has frightened me and my family, and I didn't know what was happening.'

He described how his wife Tania had to tie his shoes and button his shirts because the seizures became so bad. Medics told him he had just a decade before he would become unable to function.

His health issues were among the reasons he decided to move to Dallas from New York for its warmer climate.

Eventually, he went to Carrick Brain Centers, which discovered he had a variety of ailments, including an autoimmune disorder and adrenal fatigue.

He added: 'We went and after a few short visits they found that I had several things going on -- from an autoimmune disorder to adrenal fatigue, and they found the connection on everything that was going on.'

Beck was given months of treatment and made huge changes to his diet and lifestyle. Now says he is  on the mend.

'My brain is back online in a big way.I have received a clean bill of health,' he said.
