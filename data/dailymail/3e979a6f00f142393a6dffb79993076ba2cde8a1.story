A shelter in place warning has been lifted at the University of Oklahoma following reports of a possible shooting but further investigation led campus and city police to question whether there had been any shots fired.Â 

University president David Boren held a press conference at 1pm local time saying that the students who called in the alleged shots may have heard 'machinery backfiring' and assumed the worst.

'At this time, there is no evidence that shots were fired,' Mr Boren said at the press conference.

'It appears to be a false alarm. We have not been able to confirm that any shots were fired.'

On the scene: Police are still searching one building on the Norman, Oklahoma campus but all others have been urged to resume regular activity

False alarm? The no injuries have been reported

Back to business: Tensions were running high after a shooting on a college campus yesterday in Indiana

'Classes are going on as normal in all
 other buildings except Gould Hall. Additional search of Gould Hall 
being conducted just in case.'

The
 original order was issued at 11.20am local time and few details were 
released, with school administrators only telling students to avoid 
Gould Hall on the Norman, Oklahoma campus.

Just
 over 30 minutes after the initial report of a shooting was issued, a 
new tweet was sent out saying that normal campus operations had resumed 
everywhere except for Gould Hall.

There have been no reports about possible suspects or any injuries.

Scare: A shelter-in-place order was issued and later lifted after police found no evidence of a shooting at the University of Oklahoma on Wednesday

There are more than 30,300 students who 
attend the state school, and Gould Hall is the home of the school's 
architecture program.

Classes were in session when the text alert was sent out to students.

Though it was later decided by police that no shots had actually been fired, many were on high alert because there was a shooting on another college campus just yesterday.

On Tuesday afternoon, a male student brought a gun onto Purdue University's West Lafayette, Indiana campus and killed a fellow student.
