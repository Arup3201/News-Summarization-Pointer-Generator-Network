An Alabama man awoke from a routine circumcision to find doctors had mistakenly amputated his penis, according to a lawsuit.

Johnny Lee Banks Jr., 56, and his wife, Zelda Banks, 55, filed the lawsuit against Princeton Baptist Medical Center in Jefferson County Circuit Court in Birmingham on Tuesday.

'My client is devastated,' their attorney, John P. Graves, said.

It is not known why Banks underwent the circumcision last month, but the lawsuit says he had been receiving treatment from the Urology Centers of Alabama when he went for the procedure.

'Botched procedure': A patient is suing Princeton Baptist Medical Center, pictured, after he went in for a routine circumcision operation but awoke to find doctors had amputated his penis

In his lawsuit, he says he was never warned that the procedure might result in an amputation, and he never gave his consent for a full or partial amputation.

He has now been left in extreme pain and has spent additional time recovering in the hospital - costing him more money, according to the lawsuit, AL.com reported.

His wife is also suing for loss of consortium due to the botched operation.

The suit names the hospital, Urology Centers of Alabama, the Simon-Williamson Clinic and two doctors as defendants in the case.

Banks, who does not work due to a disability, is seeking an unspecified dollar amount in the suit.

A hospital spokeswoman says the claims lack merit but that they cannot provide further comment due to the ongoing litigation.

The other defendants didn't return messages seeking comment.

A similar lawsuit was brought in Kentucky in 2011 after a man's penis was partially amputated when a doctor found potentially deadly cancer while performing a circumcision surgery.

But a jury concluded that the doctor exercised proper care in performing the amputation without consulting the patient.
