Shopkeeper Imran Pervais (pictured) is accused of deliberately trying to short-change a customer so he could keep the winning amount himself

A shopkeeper tried to claim an £80,000 lottery jackpot by telling the lucky ticket holder he had only won £10, a court heard.

Imran Pervais is accused of deliberately trying to short-change Callum Crosier, who was part of syndicate of 28, so he could keep the winning amount himself.

Mr. Crosier said his winning ticket was found screwed up in a ball under the counter at Pervais' store after he had been given just £10 for it.

The alleged con came after Mr. Crosier went to Moores Convenience Store in Gravesend, Kent, and handed over four tickets from the previous Saturday's National Lottery draw.

Each contained seven lines and the first produced a £10 win with a corresponding pink receipt-type slip of paper.

The second ticket produced nothing but when the third was checked it also produced a pink slip.

Mr. Crosier told Maidstone Crown Court he asked Pervais 'What's that, another tenner?' and the 26 year-old shopkeeper allegedly replied 'Yes'.

Having been told he had won a total of £20 Mr Crosier used the money and a further £8 to buy another 28 lines for the next draw.

The court heard he then left the shop and spent the weekend in Germany watching Chelsea beat Bayern Munich in the Champions' League Final last May.

On his return he checked his numbers on a spreadsheet he used for an additional 'in-house' bingo game played by his syndicate of 28 work colleagues at Morrisons Utility Services in Chatham, Kent.

It was then that he realised they had won more than £10 and he went back to the store to double-check the ticket which he had given Pervais.

He mistakenly thought they had successfully picked out five numbers and stood to win £1,000 - when in fact they also had the bonus ball and had won £79,887.

The jury heard that Pervais was there when Mr Crosier arrived and appeared to be 'taken aback' when he told him about their win.

Pervais and other staff agreed to search for his ticket and told Mr Crosier to return a few hours later.

The court heard that Mr. Crosier then told Camelot what had happened and gave them the unique number for the store's lottery terminal.

Having returned to work still without the missing ticket, Mr Crosier checked his numbers again online and discovered the true size of their win.

'I just sunk,' he told the jury. 'I was gutted because this had gone from £10 to £1,000 to almost 80 grand.

'I went and told my boss and he hit the roof and told me to get back down that shop and find that ticket.'

Pervais was in the shop when Mr. Crosier went back to look for his ticket - this time with two colleagues.

He said: 'You can imagine my mood had changed slightly from winning £1,000.

'I said: "I'm not leaving this shop until I have this ticket in my hand. It's worth £80,000 and something is not right here." I wasn't messing around, I wanted my ticket.'

The court heard that staff, including Pervais, gave Mr Crosier and his pals bin bags to search and after about 15 minutes he was invited to search behind the counter.

Wooden platforms were removed from the base of the counter and when one of the shop staff swept underneath with a broom out came a lottery ticket rolled up into a ball.

Mr Crosier added: 'As he opened the ticket I saw the date and grabbed it out of his hand straight away and said: "That's my ticket." I then recognised the numbers.

'I was just relieved to have the ticket,' he said. 'I wasn't suspecting anything.'

During cross-examination he agreed Pervais had offered him the winning tickets and corresponding pink slips back when he initially went to the store on May 18.

'That's my fault for being too trustworthy of someone I have known for a few years,' added Mr Crosier.

The court heard Camelot launched their own investigation, which led to Pervais' arrest the following month and the money was paid out to the syndicate.

The prosecution claim that Pervais 'deliberately and dishonestly' misled Mr. Crosier and the only 'logical conclusion' was that he could claim the winning £79,887 himself.

But the defendant - who denies fraud by false misrepresentation - claims the short-changing was a mistake.

The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
