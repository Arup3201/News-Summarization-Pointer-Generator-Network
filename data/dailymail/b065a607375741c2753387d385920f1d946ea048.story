The moment that New York nanny Yoselyn Ortega plunged a
knife into her own throat after killing her two charges was witnessed by the 10-year-old son of the Super at
the family's Manhattan home.

The childrens' mother, Marina Krim, 
returned to her Upper West Side home on October 25 to find her six-year-old daughter Lucia 
and two-year-old son Leo dead in a pool of blood in the bathtub.

On hearing Mrs Krim's screams, the building's super ran to the Krims apartment - with his young son trailing behind him to confront the horrific scene.

As Marina cradled her surviving daughter, Nessie, the father and
son witnessed Ortega, 50, apparently attempt to inflict a fatal wound across her throat. Her
wrists had already been slit.

The young boy will almost certainly undergo therapy to overcome
the trauma.

This latest detail emerged as removers packed up boxes of
the Krims' belongings. Sources have suggested the family will not
return to the apartment where Lucia and Leo were
killed.

Ortega, Lucia and Leo had been due to meet Mrs Krim and Nessie at a dance studio, but the mother became concerned when they failed to turn up and returned to the home.

After learning from the doorman that the nanny had not left the building, Mrs Krim frantically searched the apartment and came across the grisly scene in the bathroom.

Ortega's suicide bid failed and she was put in a medically-induced coma. She has now been brought out of this and charged with first degree murder.

When
questioned by police for the first time Saturday, the nanny attempted 
to paint Mrs Krim in a bad light, shifting part of the blame for the 
tragedy on her.

Ortega, who had told neighbours and family that she was short of money, revealed she resented her employers because they kept telling her what to 
do and asked her to do the housework.

Law
enforcement officials told the New York Post that the Krims asked
their her to do simple housework as a way to 
earn money, thinking they were helping. All this did was 
enrage her.

'She said 
something like, "I'm paid to watch the children, not clean up and do 
housework",' a law-enforcement source said of Ortega’s statements to 
police after she woke from the coma.

Yoselyn became extremely animated 
when she discussed the incident with police, telling officers that  she 
had numerous disagreements with mother 
Marina about how the kids were being cared for.

Ortega waived her right to have a lawyer
present during questioning when she ominously told the detective, 
'Marina knows what happened', a source told the New York Times.

Reports claimed Marina didn't think 
Yoselyn was interacting with the kids enough and was giving them junk 
food when she was out of sight.

The Krims were also reportedly worried
about Ortega's job performance in the weeks leading up to the killings 
and had told her that if she didn't improve, they might need to replace 
her.

But the Krims' extended family dispute they treated her poorly, explaining that they paid for her to travel on holidays and even visited her family in the Dominican Republic.

In a brief interview this week, Karen
Krim, the slain children's paternal grandmother, said that they 
continue to grapple with the horrific crime.

'Under the circumstances, we are all doing as well as can be expected,' she said.

The family paid tribute to the murdered youngsters at Manhattan's Avery Hall on Monday.

Breaking down in tears, Kevin 
Krim recalled the happy days he and his wife Marina shared with their 
children and asked that the lives of
their 'best friends' be celebrated rather than mourned.

Krim, his wife and their surviving daughter, Nessie, have been in seclusion since the murders.
