Smashed: The property is held up by scaffolding and the brick wall show the impact of the lorry

A recluse weighing 35-stone was forced to abandon his home yesterday after a council lorry smashed into it - leaving his house for the first time in years.

Mark Dawson, was named by his neighbours who said they have never seen leaving his home with the only activity outside the cottage being supermarket and takeaway deliveries to his door.

Mr Dawson was forced to abandon his cottage in Bishop’s Stortford, Hertfordshire, on Tuesday after a council cleaning truck reversed into it smashing the front window and door.

Firefighters were called to secure the scene at 12.30pm and brought Mr Dawson out through the back.

Friends said they believed Mark, who neighbours estimate weighs 35-stone had either been rehoused, or was staying with relatives.

One neighbour, who lives three doors from the damaged house, said: ‘I have never seen him. I have lived here for three years and I have never seen him leave.

‘He even has his shopping delivered from supermarkets so he didn’t have to go anywhere.

‘He would probably never have left if it wasn’t for the council lorry.’

Another neighbour, who witnessed the incident, said: ‘The truck was parked up across the street, the driver had got out to go to the toilet and forgotten to put the hand break on.

‘Next thing you know, the bin lorry starts rolling towards our row. I heard a loud thud and came out to have a look at the damage.'

The neighbour said that Mr Dawson rarely leaved the house and was now likely to be staying with family until his house was safe.

Another eye witnesses said Mr Dawson seemed very distressed about leaving his home.

Recluse: Mr Dawson is said to rarely leave home and has all food delivered to the door. It may therefore be the first time in years he has been outside his Hertfordshire property

An ambulance was called to collect the stunned resident and the property was boarded up earlier today with scaffolding appearing to hold up the front wall.

The East Hertfordshire District Council vehicle rolled from the cemetery across a roundabout into the terraced cottage in Bishop’s Stortford, on Tuesday morning.

The driver, who had pulled up to use the public toilets at the cemetery, told police the handbrake had failed.

Mr Dawson, who was unhurt, was reassured by an officer while police climbed over the back garden wall using a ladder to access the property.

Fire and rescue crews cordoned off the area and used props and boards to stabilise the front of the cottage and the neighbouring property in preparation for the truck to be recovered.

A structural engineer arrived on the scene at about midday to assess the damage’

Hertfordshire Fire and Rescue Service Incident commander Dean Risley said: ‘The porch is only staying up because it’s sitting on the roof of the vehicle.

‘The chances are it will probably come down but we’re hoping it might not.

‘It will have to come down eventually anyway because it’s unsafe.’

East Herts District Council confirmed today that they are investigating the situation.
