Generous donors have contributed more than $55,000 to the family of an 8-year-old boy who saved his relatives from a fire before dying in the flames - but his parents are now fighting over how the money should be spent.

A friend and neighbor of Tyler Doohan's mother, Crystal Vrooman, set up the online fundraiser through the website YouCaring and initially hoped to raise $5,000 to 'give this baby the (funeral) service he deserves.'

But the incredibly heroic actions of the boy who went back into the burning mobile home to rescue his disabled grandfather made headlines the world over, resulting in more than 10 times that amount flooding in for the family.

Fundraiser: A friend and neighbor of Tyler Doohan's mother, Crystal Vrooman, set up the online fundraiser through the website YouCaring and initially hoped to raise $5,000 to 'give this baby the (funeral) service he deserves'

'My intention was to pay for the memorial service,' Theresa Fiorica, 28, told FoxNews.com. 'I didn't think that it was going to go as far and as big as it did.'

The account names Vrooman as the beneficiary, and the distraught mother, who did not live in the Penfield trailer that burned, said she hopes to use the money to buy a new home.

'My son just got lost in a huge tragedy,' Vrooman told FoxNews.com. 'Do you think I want to move into a trailer? I want a nice house (as) I have always been telling the kids, and to give my kids a great school district.'

But the boy's father, Jason Doohan, has attacked his ex-girlfriend, claiming she's not fit to be handling the money.

'My actual fear is that she is not going to use the money properly,' Doohan said. 'My son is the greatest kid Iâ€™ve ever known. Use (the money) the right way, on what Tyler would want it to be spent on.'

The boy's uncle, Joseph Breyette, 43, 
who is speaking for the fire's survivors agrees, and pointed out 
Vrooman's previous substance abuse problems, which she claims are 
'years' behind her.

'My 
biggest concern is that the money is going to be mismanaged and the 
people who went through the tragedy are going to be forgotten,' Breyette
 told FoxNews.com.

'I would prefer someone court-appointed, not her, should have control of that money.'

Vrooman
 insists she hasn't touched any of the money yet and said she plans to hire an attorney to handle the account. She also wants to thank everyone 
who donated for their support.

'I
 will hire an attorney to do this right and have receipts to do 
everything,' Vrooman said. 'I planned on having receipts to show 
everyone what we used the money for and to send out thank you cards... 
to say thank you to these people.'

News
 of the disagreement came as Penfield Fire Chief Chris Ebmeyer said revealed Thursday that 
he was so impressed with the child's bravery that he is considering giving Tyler an honorary firefighter's 
funeral to recognize his heroic actions.

'From
 our standpoint as a fire department, this kid definitely played a role 
in saving six individuals' lives, and he lost his life trying to save a 
seventh and an eighth. It brings it into a different arena...This hero 
deserves to be recognized for what he did,' Ebmeyer said.

Smile: Vrooman recalled hugging her son, pictured, goodbye before the sleepover with his grandfather, and he had a big smile on his face

On Wednesday, a tearful Vrooman described being 
'really proud' of her son for what he did but said she just wanted him back.

Tyler
 and his grandfather, who Vrooman said was his 'best friend,' were found
 together on a bed in the back room of the charred mobile home. 
Authorities said it appeared the child was trying to lift the elderly 
man off the bed when he was overcome by smoke and flames.

'All I could think about is how he couldn't breathe, how scared he must have been, Vrooman told WHAM Wednesday.

She added: 'I'm just so grateful that he went with people that he loved. He didn't go alone.'

The boy, from East Rochester, was staying with relatives in nearby Penfield overnight on Sunday.

Vrooman recalled hugging her son goodbye before the sleepover, and he had a big smile on his face.

But
 around 4.45 a.m. Monday, Tyler noticed a fire had broken out in the 
narrow trailer when his 4-year-old cousin's blanket set alight. 

Vrooman
 told the station that, after waking five of his relatives and ensuring 
they got out safely, Tyler broke away from his aunt and ran back inside 
the burning trailer.

'He just ran to the back steps and my sister followed him and tried to stop him,' said Vrooman.

The boy's grandfather was disabled and would have been unable to get out of the home on his own, Ebmeyer said.

'By that time, the fire had traveled 
to the back of the trailer,' said Ebmeyer. 'Unfortunately they both 
succumbed to heat and smoke.'

Vrooman said her sister initially had Tyler's hand when he stepped into the trailer.

'I
 guess he let go of her and tried to get to my dad. She opened the 
window and he wasn't there anymore. She started feeling around through 
the smoke,' she said, crying.

'It was his best friend, and he just tried to save him.'

Ebmeyer said the trailer had no working smoke detector.

He said that with so many people in one small mobile home, one alarm could have easily woken everyone in time to survive.

There was at least one space heater inside the trailer, he said.

Another relative was killed in the fire along with several pets - including dogs, cats, a rabbit and hamsters, Ebmeyer said.

Fatalities: The raging blaze killed Doohan, his grandfather and amputee uncle, who were unable to flee in time

Horrific find: Tyler's body was found in the rare of the scorched home, just feet away from the bedridden family member he was trying to rescue

Earlier Wednesday, Cpl. John
 Helfer of the Monroe County Sheriff's Office said nine people were in 
the single-wide mobile home when the electrical fire started.

The Democrat and Chronicle reported
 that Tyler asked his mother if he could stay with his grandfather at 39
 Fondiller Avenue because he knew he was off from school Monday for 
Martin Luther King Jr. Day.

The boy's uncle, Joseph Breyette, said his young nephew heard his grandfather calling for help inside the house and rushed in to get him. 

'The
 kid has got more guts than I know of,' Breyette said. 'I mean to run 
back in there and go through what he went through to try to save him, 
what can you say for the kid? He was a great kid.'

The
 child's body was discovered by firefighters in the rear bedroom just a 
few feet away from the bed of his disabled grandfather.

The boy's relatives who managed to flee from the trailer were taken to Strong Memorial Hospital.

Ebmeyer said if it weren't for Tyler's actions, the number of fatalities could have been much higher.

'He saved those other people,' he said.

Makeshift memorial: Tyler's friends and members of the community have been leaving teddy bears, flowers and other tokens in honor of the brave fourth-grader

Neighbors at the trailer park said the
 reason the mobile home was overcrowded with people Sunday night was 
because he often welcomed down-on-their-luck relatives who needed a 
place to stay.

Those 
who knew the family described Tyler as a rambunctious boy who liked 
playing kickball and tag with other children in the area.

According to his education records, the child had been in and out of several different schools over the past few years.

He was currently enrolled as a fourth-grader in the East Rochester Central School District, where officials called the boy a hero this week.

'He was the kind of young man who would bend over backwards for anybody. He was a very caring individual always came to school with a smile on his face. Always asking what can I do to help,' Interim Superintendent Richard Stutzman Jr told the station WHEC.

Stutzman added: 'In bravely and selflessly giving his own life, he was able to save the lives of six others - and he truly is a hero.'
