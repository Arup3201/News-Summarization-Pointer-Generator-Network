Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich is today facing questions that he may have ignored child labour laws by allowing his daughter to work as a church janitor when she was 13.

During a presidential debate in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, on Monday, the former House speaker revealed that in the 1980s his daughter Jackie Gingrich Cushman worked in the part-time, minimum wage job.

He was defending remarks he had made in December, when he said poor children in low-income households should be given the opportunity to be janitors at their own schools.

But federal child labour laws in effect today and during the 1980s specify that children are not allowed to hold such cleaning jobs, and that there are no exceptions made for places of worship.

Reid Maki, of The Child Labor Coalition, told MSNBC: 'I definitely see it as a child labour violation. When you put a kid in a situation that's designed for adults you're asking for trouble.'

The law only permits 13-year-olds to 
deliver newspapers; babysit; work in a business solely owned or operated
by their parents; and work as an actor or performer in film, TV, 
theatre or radio.

Newt Gingrich's second wife claims she could end his presidential campaign with an explosive television interview, it emerged today.

Marianne Gingrich, who was married to the GOP candidate from 1981 to 2000, has recorded an interview with ABC News.

No details of what Marianne actually 
told ABC have yet been made public, but the apparent debate within the 
network as to when the interview should be aired suggests that her views
will be controversial.

But the network is debating when to show the interview amid fears it could be seen as biased if it contributes to wrecking Mr Gingrich's election prospects.

Newt and Marianne Gingrich were married from 1981 to 2000, after he divorced his first wife Jackie and before his marriage to Callista, a fixture on the campaign trail.

Mr Gingrich is a staunch opponent of the legislation, which he has described as 'stupid'.

During Monday's debate, he offered other examples where children as young as 11 have earned their own money.

He said: 'They'd be getting money, which is a good thing if you're poor. Only the elites despise earning money.'

'Iâ€™m going to continue to find ways to help poor people learn how to get a job, learn how to get a better job and learn someday to own the job,' he added.

In December, the former Georgia lawmaker had told a crowd in Des Moines, Iowa, that children in poor neighbourhoods have 'no habits of working and nobody around them who works'.

Throughout his campaign, Mr Gingrich 
has reiterated the point that successful people have started out working
early in life, shovelling snow, babysitting and delivering newspapers.

He has questioned child labour laws and spoken of the need for people to help break themselves out of a cycle of poverty.

But Professor Hugh Hindman, of 
Appalachian State University and the author of Child Labor: An American 
History, told MSNBC: 'Substitution of child labour for adult labour is 
never an economic bargain.

'Not
only are adults with full-time jobs earning living wages displaced by 
kids with part-time jobs earning minimum wages, but the competition 
between children and adults will also depress the wages of those adults 
who hold on to their jobs.'

Sticking to his guns: Mr Gingrich is a staunch opponent of the current child labour laws, describing the legislation as 'stupid'

Candidate: Mr Gingrich waves to supporters as he arrives for a town hall meeting with his wife Callista at Mutt's BBQ in Easley, South Carolina, yesterday

He added: 'Poor kids do need this kind of opportunity, but I'm not sure janitorial service is the ticket.'

Mr Gingrich said his daughter did janitorial work at the First Baptist Church in Carrollton, Georgia, when she was a teenager and that the example could be turned into a model for the entire country.

Her father also took a swipe at New York City unions saying that 30 schoolchildren could be hired to replace one janitor because the unions had negotiated such high pay for their workers.

Recalling her time as a janitor, his daughter Jackie today said: 'I was actually proud of my clean bathrooms. I learned work has value.'
