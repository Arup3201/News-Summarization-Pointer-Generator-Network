Jeremy Darroch, chief executive of BSkyB requested that an article about a controversial deal be removed from the Sky News website

The chief executive of British Sky Broadcasting ordered Sky News to remove a story from its website about a controversial Formula 1 deal following complaints from racing teams.

Martin Turner, executive producer of Sky Sports' new F1 channel contacted his boss Jeremy Darroch from Melbourne on Sunday ahead of the Australian Grand Prix, it was claimed.

The broadcaster spent tens of millions of pounds securing the rights to jointly show most of this season's races live with the BBC, as well as a number of exclusive races.

The channel was due to air its first F1 broadcast but there had been a strong negative reaction from some racing teams that Mr Turner relayed to Mr Darroch.

The story outlined an deal being struck between Bernie Ecclestone, F1's chief executive, Red Bull and Ferrari.

Mr Darroch ordered for the article to be taken down and John Ryley, head of Sky News started a review of the story, according to the Financial Times.

The article was republished but parts were missing including a direct quote from confidential documents.

A spokesman from BSkyB said: 'The piece was withdrawn for further review.  We stand by the story and, following that review, took the decision to re-publish on Monday.'

A source added: 'Really it was a question about how we published the story rather than when.

'We should have made Sky Sports teams aware because they were in the pits and were getting a reaction late on Saturday night.'

The source declined to comment further on whether the news arm of BSkyB should cow-tow to demands from other branches of the organisation.

Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation 
withdrew its BSkyB takeover bid of Sky News as the phone-hacking scandal
erupted after questions were raised over whether it was right to buy 
the rest of the broadcaster.

The story outlined an deal being struck between Bernie Ecclestone, F1's chief executive (pictured, Red Bull, and Ferrari.

Ofcom said it would launch an investigation into News Corp to see whether it was 'fit and proper' for such a takeover and what whether it would affect the diversity of the UK news industry.

The documents appeared to show that an agreement had been made between Bernie Ecclestone and CVC, the company that owns F1's commercial rights, and racing teams Ferrari and Red Bull.

Sky News reporter Mark Kleinman said in his blog that 'Goldman Sachs had been asked by CVC to examine plans for a placement of part of its stake in F1 potentially as soon as the next few months, which would form part of a process leading to an initial public offering of the business'.

In the papers he had been handed, he said that Ferrari could buy a share in CVC because it had competed in the most seasons since 1959.

The FT said that seven of the 12 teams that take part in Formula 1 met on Sunday to co-ordinate a response to the report.

Mr Ecclestone and CVC have negotiated separate deals with Red Bulll and Ferrari,  sources told the paper, as part of an obligation to divide revenues with all teams until 2020.
