They say it ain’t over till the fat lady sings, but calling an opera singer ‘dumpy’, ‘stocky’ and a ‘chubby bundle of puppy fat’ is a different matter — as male critics who commented on rising star Tara Erraught’s appearance are discovering.

Fellow opera singers have accused them of sexism while music websites have been swamped with messages of support for 27-year-old Miss Erraught.

The row erupted after the mezzo-soprano performed for the first time at the Glyndebourne Opera Festival in the comic opera Der Rosenkavalier.

Storm: Tara Erraught, left in the male role of Octavian, received unflattering comments on her figure in reviews of her performance

Row: Rival opera experts have come out in defence of Ms Erraught, saying that the quality of a performers' voice is the only relevant quality

Dispute: Ms Erraught was palying a leading role in Richard Strauss's Der Rosenkavalier

The reviews provoked a furious 
backlash because though her singing was widely praised, some included 
disparaging remarks about her shape.

Rupert
 Christiansen of the Daily Telegraph said Miss Erraught is ‘dumpy of 
stature and . . . her costuming makes her resemble something between 
Heidi and Just William’.

The Times described her as ‘unbelievable, unsightly and unappealing’.

The
 classical music website Slipped Disc hit back saying: ‘Tara Erraught 
may carry slightly more heft than a size eight, but what has that to do 
with performance?

‘Does excess body weight affect artistic performance on stage? Obviously not, as Luciano Pavarotti loudly demonstrated.’

Alice
 Coote, a leading mezzo-soprano, said: ‘We cannot people our operatic 
stages with singers that above all are believable visually or sexually 
attractive to our critics — that way lies the death of opera . . . opera
 is all about the voice.’

A
 spokesman for Irish-born Miss Erraught said: ‘Tara is focused on the 
music and  preparing for her upcoming performances. There will be no 
further statement at this time.’

However,
 her parents, who live near Dundalk and went to the opening night at 
Glyndebourne on Saturday, voiced their distress at the row to the Mail.

‘Tara is concentrating on her work and not getting involved in the debate,’ said her mother Brianain, 50.

‘So,
 we are not saying anything, even though there’s lots I would like to 
say. She has a show tonight and just needs to concentrate on that.

‘Tara
 has such inner strength. She takes the view that what’s said is said, 
it’s out there now, and it would be much worse if they were criticising 
her singing rather than her body.

‘She is getting tremendous support from everyone around her. She is a professional and is just getting on with it.

‘We’ve never had to face this before. She’s been reviewed in a lot of places and there’s never been an issue like this before.’

Miss
 Erraught’s father Joe, 63, added: ‘I am so, so proud of my beautiful 
daughter. You have to meet her to know you are living with an angel. All
 of us — her family and people around here — are so proud of her. She is
 a young woman of substance and I’m delighted to be able to say that 
about my lovely girl.

‘I saw
 her performance in Der Rosenkavalier and she was fantastic. She got a 
standing ovation — what more could you ask for? She couldn’t have done 
any better.

‘I wouldn’t like
 to comment on the people who made the remarks about her. She’s a 
sensible girl — it won’t affect her too much.’

Tara
 began singing lessons at school when she was ten, but it was a family 
holiday to Italy that set her on the path to becoming an internationally
 acclaimed opera singer.

‘We
 went to Verona and experienced a stunning production of [Verdi’s] Aida,
 a life-changing experience and my first-ever live opera performance,’ 
she said in a recent interview.

‘I
 already knew that I loved to sing, but this opera experience was a new 
firework that interested me beyond belief. And that was it: I had 
decided!’

After opera 
singing lessons, she went on to study at the Royal Irish Academy of 
Music in Dublin and then joined the Bavarian State Opera company.

She
 was catapulted to world-wide acclaim three years ago when she replaced 
an ailing colleague in the role of Romeo with just five days’ notice to 
learn the part.

One German 
reviewer said at the time: ‘They call it a breakthrough when a star is 
born . . . Tara Erraught creates moments of wonder.’

She
 has won several prestigious awards, toured the U.S. and made her London
 recital debut at the Wigmore Hall in April. Fellow opera singers have 
joined the protest at the Glyndebourne reviews and have spoken out in 
support of the young singer.

'Derisive': The criticism of Ms Erraught has been characterised as fat-shaming

Mezzo-soprano
 Jennifer Johnson said: ‘How have we arrived at a point where opera is 
no longer about singing but about the physique and looks of the singers?
 Clearly overt sexism is still rife.’

And
 bass baritone Trevor Bowes has published a hard-hitting open letter to 
Tara. ‘The hideous, immature, low-life trash that we saw hurled in the 
name of music criticism could have landed on anyone,’ he said.

‘I am so deeply angry it happened to a radiant, beautiful performer bubbling with talent and technique.

‘You
 have taken a bullet, but it will not be in vain. You have taken that 
bullet for all of us, and it is our responsibility to make change in our
 world.

‘We singers have all
 been nagged or bullied about our bodies, though usually in private, and
 it has done nothing but harm to us and to the artform.

‘It
 is my hope that this has not only exposed certain critics as perverted 
schoolboys with no imagination, but that it has also exposed everything 
that has gone wrong in the opera world over the last generation or so.

‘I
 believe this critic debacle and the backlash has been a catalyst to 
usher in a new era where singing and artistry matter most, once again. 
It is  long overdue!’

Yesterday,
 Daily Telegraph critic Mr Christiansen said he is ‘distressed to learn 
that Miss Erraught has been upset by the hoo-ha’, but said he stands by 
every word he wrote.

He defended his review, saying he felt she had been cast ‘against type’ in a ‘principal boy’ role.

He added that Miss Erraught is ‘a very pretty girl with a delightful smile and endearing stage presence’.

Yes, it’s true that the Irish soprano Tara Erraught is never going to win Miss World, or even Miss Dundalk, any time soon.

But then none of the shockingly ungallant critics who have described her as fat is a candidate for Mr Universe.

Their complaint is that her role is unconvincing because she lacks the gamin, androgynous qualities of a principal boy.

It is true that she suffers by comparison with her lover, sung by Kate 
Royal, who is lissom and appears stark naked at the opening of the work.

Even so, Miss Erraught sings fabulously, which is all that matters to some of the more old-fashioned of us.

She
 may not look remotely masculine, or have heart-throb qualities, but if 
you can’t suspend disbelief, you shouldn’t go to the opera.

What’s
 more, I’ve seen much fatter singers — including one playing Wagner’s 
great character Isolde, who was nearly the size of Yorkshire.

Der Rosenkavalier is a comedy — not quite a Carry On, but not far off.

As such, Miss Erraught should ignore her critics.

A great future in opera awaits her, whatever they say.

Ms Erraught, from Dundalk, Ireland, graduated from the Royal Irish Academy of Music in Dublin and has been a member of the opera studio at the Bavarian State Opera in Munich since 2008.

In summer 2010 she joined internationally celebrated French pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet for the Prinsengracht-concert telecast from the canals of Amsterdam and made her debut at the Glyndebourne Festival Opera.

Ms Erraught won First Prize in the Jakub Pustina International Singing Competition in the Czech Republic along with the Zdar nad Sazavou Audience Prize in May 2008.

In that same year she was awarded with both the Houston Grand Opera Prize and the Washington National Opera Prize at the International Hans Gabor Belvedere Singing Competition in Vienna.

In March of 2010 she was awarded the National Concert Hall's Rising Star Award in Dublin. She has also won the Dermott Troy Award for the Best Irish Singer.

Her professional debut came last year when, aged 26, she sand Il Barbiere di Siviglia at the Wiener 
Staatsoper, and has performed in many acclaimed roles since.
