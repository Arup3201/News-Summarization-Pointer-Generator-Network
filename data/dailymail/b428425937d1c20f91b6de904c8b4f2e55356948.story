Former Vice-President Dick Cheney has revealed he once feared that terrorists could use the electrical device that had been implanted near his heart to kill him. and had his doctor disable its wireless function.

Mr Cheney, who has a history of heart trouble and suffered the first of five heart attacks at age 37, ordered his doctor to disable the wireless function.

He was reminded of his concerns while watching the popular TV series Homeland, where a senator was killed by a terrorist who tampered with his pacemaker.

'I was aware of the danger, if you will,
that existed, but I found it credible,' Mr Cheney told 60 Minutes, in a 
segment to be aired on Sunday.

Medical record: Dick Cheney and his doctor, Jonathan Reiner, have written a book together

'I know from the experience we had 
and the necessity for adjusting my own device that it was an accurate 
portrayal of what was possible,' he added.

The former Vice-President, who had a heart transplant last year when he was 71, said doctors replaced an implanted defibrillator near his heart in 2007.

Mr Cheney said that cardiologist Jonathan Reiner turned off the wireless function of the device, which controls irregular heartbeats with electric jolts, in case a terrorist tried to send his heart a fatal shock.

While the Homeland scene may at first have appeared far-fetched, Australian researcher Darren Pauli claimed it was possible to deliver deadly shocks to pacemakers from 30ft away,

Mr Cheney and his doctor are currently promoting a book they co-authored, entitled Heart: An American Medical Odyssey.

In the 60 Minutes interview, Dr Reiner said he was worried for Mr Cheney's health during the September 11, 2001 terror attacks.

Medical
tests seen that morning showed Mr Cheney had elevated levels of 
potassium in his blood, a condition called hyperkalemia, which could 
lead to abnormal heart rhythms and cardiac arrest.

Going strong: Vice-President Cheney had a heart transplant last year

Dr Reiner said as he watched news coverage of the tragic events on television he thought, 'Oh, great, the vice-president is going to die tonight from hyperkalemia.'

Mr Cheney underwent numerous heart-related procedures over the years, including angioplasties, catheterizations and a quadruple bypass operation.

However, he said the health problems never affected his job performance during his eight years as vice-president in George W. Bush's administration.

Asked if he worried about his physical health impacting his judgment and cognition, Mr Cheney replied: 'No.'

He said he was aware of potential side effects from limited blood flow to the brain and effects on cognition and judgment but didn't worry about it.

'You know, I was as good as I could be, given the fact I was 60-some years old at that point and a heart patient,' Mr Cheney said.

He dismissed stress as having had an impact on his heart disease, adding: 'I always did what I needed to do in order to deal with the health crisis in the moment.'
