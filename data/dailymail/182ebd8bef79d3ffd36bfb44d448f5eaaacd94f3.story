Andrew Flintoff, nicknamed Freddie for cartoon character Fred Flintstone, said it was wife Rachael who helped him get over the eating disorder

On the cricket field, Andrew Flintoff was a swashbuckling force of nature.

But the former England captain has spoken of how he was secretly battling bulimia – and might never have recovered without his wife’s support.

The sportsman, nicknamed Freddie for cartoon character Fred Flintstone, said it was wife Rachael who helped him get over the eating disorder.

As a young man, poor diet and heavy drinking saw his weight soar to 17st 12lb.

Speaking to Piers Morgan for his Life Stories TV series, he pointed to a newspaper article from 2000 stating that he was heavier than the boxer Lennox Lewis.

The 36-year-old, said: ‘I did [get upset] but I thought I couldn’t really tell anyone because in the world I was in … you want to come away as being almost bulletproof.’

It is the first time he has spoken in depth about his cycle of bingeing and making himself sick – even during international matches. Flintoff, who shed two stone during his illness, said: ‘Everyone was happy with me, I’d gone from that fat fella you saw making his Test debut to getting into some sort of shape. 

'I was doing it a lot. I was doing it at lunchtime, I would come off and have something to eat and go and bowl again.

‘I was cautious, you’d see if anyone was in the toilets with you and you’d find somewhere to go.’

He recalled a talk given to the England squad by a dietician: ‘She started saying … she dealt with models, actors, athletes who have had eating disorders. I thought, “Oh, I can have a chat with her after this,” and then she said, “But I can’t imagine there’s any of that in here,” and I thought, “I can’t tell her now, jeez”.’

Flintoff said he could not have recovered without Rachael, 36, who he met in 2002.

That year marked a turning point in which he found his form and hit his maiden Test century after being criticised for inconsistency. He said it was ‘no coincidence’, adding: ‘Professionally, I don’t think I could have done all the things I’ve done without her. She’s always there.’

They married in 2005. Having retired in 2010 due to injury, he has this year returned to cricket, playing for Lancashire.

The 36-year-old, who made a return to professional cricket last month, said: ‘I did [get upset] but I thought I couldn’t really tell anyone because in the world I was in'
