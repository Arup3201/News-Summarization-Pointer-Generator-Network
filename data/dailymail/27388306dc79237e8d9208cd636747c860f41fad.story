A 19-year-old Massachussetts man this weekend became the first known person to have bail paid after requesting someone pick him up from jail on Facebook.

Arrested Saturday evening for disturbing the peace, David White’s calls home seeking assistance went unanswered, so he made the unusual step of asking police if he could post on Facebook asking for help.

A friend soon arrived to pay the $40 fee needed to spring him from his cell, according to the Newburyport Daily News.

The first-ever Facebook bail request: David White was released from jail this weekend after making a request on Facebook for someone to help him with bail

Police responding to a raging house party Saturday night in Beverly, on the coast about 25 miles north of Boston, encountered as many as 150 uncooperative, underage drunk people, they told the Daily News.

The unruly mob forced the officers to call for backup from state police and two neighboring towns before the party was brought under control.

Among the arrested was Mr White, for disorderly conduct, officials said, and his calls home went unanswered.

Noting that most people don’t memorize phone numbers anymore, because they can look them up on cell phones, a detective told the Daily News that it often takes more than one call for people to find their way out of a predicament.

‘If they call mom and they can’t get her, we’re not going to say you can’t have another call,’ the detective added. ‘Not as long as they’re respectful and cooperative.’

The unruly teen soon ran out of numbers to call and came up with an unorthodox solution – Facebook.

Noting that detainees like Mr White can be given access to their cell phone, the detective explained it must be under strict supervision.

‘A lot of people don’t want to put it on Facebook that they’ve been arrested,’ he added.

With people routinely bouncing on Facebook just to see what friends are up to, someone was bound to answer the plea for help, the detective continued.

After an initial Facebook post noting the unusual circumstance over the weekend, some who read it criticized the department in comments.

‘We allowed it; it worked,’ the department responded. ‘We are only required to allow one phone call, but when people are cooperative with us, we work with them, and that was the case here.’

‘Another good reason to own a smartphone,’ the post finished.

Others arrested at the bash include Ronnie Alford, 42, and wife Kimberly Alford, 43, for providing alcohol to minors. Briana Doody, 20, for drunk driving. Shawn Sequeira, 18, for possessing alcohol under the age 21. As well as a 17-year-old minor for both disorderly conduct and possession of alcohol.
