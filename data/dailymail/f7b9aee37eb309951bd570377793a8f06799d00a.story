Judge Paul Batty QC deferred Musgrave's sentencing for six months so he may spend Christmas with his 14-year-old daughter for the first time

A drug dealer who has spent the last 14 Christmases in prison has been spared jail by a sympathetic judge so he may spend the festive season with his daughter. 

Richard Musgrave, 35, begged Judge Paul Batty not to send him to prison after spending every Christmas in his teenage daughter's life behind bars for a string of drug-related crimes.

The father from Carlisle, Cumbria, was told to 'stay out of trouble' for the next six months in return for a non-custodial sentence after admitting one count of methadone, a Class A drug.

Carlisle Crown Court heard how Musgrave, who appeared alongside two others, also pleaded guilty to two counts of theft before being told he could spend the festive season at home.

Judge Batty said: 'I am going to give you the best Christmas present you could ever hope for now - your liberty, but it will be in measured terms.

'If you stay out of trouble for the next six months you can expect a non-custodial sentence - because I always keep my promises. If you offend, to custody you will go.'

Prosecuting David Potter described how Musgrave used an old key to let himself into the home of his former long-term partner where he stole £40 from her purse in June.

He later stole a pack of bacon from a Spar shop, the court was told.

In his defence, barrister Tim Evans described the man as 'a hopeless, long-term drug addict' who 'has tried to do something about his addiction.'

In light of his efforts to overcome his long history of drug abuse, the judge deferred sentencing for six months.

Musgrave’s co-defendants John Thompson, 34, and Kirsty Davidson, 25, admitted being concerned in the supply of heroin and methadone, while Davidson also pleaded guilty to the supply of methamphetamine.

Mr Potter described how police raided the Cumbria home shared by Davidson and Thompson and found various drugs - including cocaine hidden in a Kinder egg - and drug paraphernalia.

Traces of heroin and methadone were found in plastic sandwich bags, while as much as £93 worth of methadone was found in two bottles in the house.

Thompson and Davidson admitted being addicted to drugs, yet initially denied supplying them to others.

However the former's defence told the court the pair dealt the illegal substances to fund their own habits.

Brendan Burke, for Davidson, said his client played a lesser role in the drug supply offence, and that she had returned to drug abuse after the death of her father.

Judge Batty jailed Thompson for 32 months, while Davidson received a sentence of two years.
