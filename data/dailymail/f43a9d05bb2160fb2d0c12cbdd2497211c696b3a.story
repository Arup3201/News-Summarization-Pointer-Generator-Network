Daley Blind says Manchester United's win over Tottenham was a team effort with no single player deserving the plaudits. 

The 25-year-old shone at left back, while goalscorers Wayne Rooney, Michael Carrick and Marouane Fellaini were also impressive in the 3-0 win on Sunday.

But Blind believes Louis van Gaal's side deserved a 'team of the match' award as recognition of the way they played a whole.

'In the last few weeks and months, we have been improving and I think we've played good halves before but we were really aggressive for almost 90 minutes. And that's a step [forward] for this team,' Blind told MUTV.

'Everybody was working so hard together and fighting for each other, winning every ball that we could. And we played like a team.

'It was really enjoyable to play. I think maybe there should be a "team of the match" [instead of man of the match].'

Blind was also happy that United got back to winning ways after losing to Arsenal in the FA Cup last Monday.  

He said: 'If it's a cup game, it's very disappointing, but if you lose in the Premier League, you want to win the next game.

'If you look at 90 minutes, it is [our best game of the season].'
