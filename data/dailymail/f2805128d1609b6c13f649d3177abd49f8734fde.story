You might struggle to see them, but these tiny artworks prove that small can be incredibly beautiful. 

The microscopic creations were handcrafted by Willard Wigan, from Birmingham, and set within the eye of a needle.

The 57-year-old artist first became interested in micro-sculpture aged five when he began making houses for ants because he thought they needed somewhere to live.

The universe - in the eye of a needle. Each piece sits in a needle, or on a pin-head, and is crafted between heartbeats, allowing the self-taught artist to reduce hand tremors

Having been described by experts as 'the eighth wonder of the world', Wigan's works are so minute that they are only visible through a microscope.

Each piece sits within the eye of a needle, or on a pin-head, and is crafted between heartbeats, allowing the self-taught artist to reduce hand tremors.

The works are set to go on display in his home city, giving a cash boost to local literacy and learning initiatives.

It takes him up to three months to create each amazing and unique sculpture, which usually sits within the eye of a needle or on a pin head

Mr Wigan said he became a patron of the Library of Birmingham Trust so that, whatever a child's background or ability, there will be a chance for them to be original and creative, to make their mark on the world

'Literacy and learning initiatives can support, encourage, challenge and enhance them, whatever their abilities. These initiatives are even more important in Birmingham where literacy levels are amongst the lowest in the country.

'I became a patron of the Library of Birmingham Trust so that, whatever a child's background or ability, there will be a chance for them to be original and creative, to make their mark on the world.'
