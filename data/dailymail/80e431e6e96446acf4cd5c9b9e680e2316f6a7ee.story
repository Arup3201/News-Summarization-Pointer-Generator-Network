Guy Fieri appeared in court on Monday to testify in the unusual case brought against a San Francisco teen accused of stealing the celebrity chef’s bright-yellow Lamborghini in 2011.

Along with the theft, Max Wade, 19, is charged with the attempted murder of a teenage girl who had spurned his romantic advances and her then-boyfriend.

Fieri took the stand for a testimony that lasted just a few minutes to confirm that he didn’t not know Wade and did not give him permission to take his $200,000 car out of a San Francisco dealership on March 8, 2011.

The celebrity chef¿s bright-yellow Lamborghini was worth $800,000 and was missing for over 18 months

Prosecutors allege that Wade stole the car in a ‘Mission Impossible’-style heist to impress the girl, Eva Dedier, who is now 19.

Then in April 2012 he attempted to kill Dedier and her former boyfriend, Landon Wahlstrom, as they sat in Wahlstrom’s truck.

That investigation led authorities to Wade's storage container in Richmond, where they found the Food Network star's stolen yellow Lamborghini.

Fieri told reporters outside of court that he is relieved the ordeal is nearly over. ‘It's been a really crazy story,’ he said.

He had been in Chicago filming his show ‘Dives, Diners and Drive-ins’ for the Food Network when he heard the car had been stolen.

‘I thought it was a bad joke,’ Fieri told NBC Bay Area.

During the 18 month period that the car, the chef said he constantly received calls from people who had spotted the vehicle.

Fieri said he thought Wade’s story would make a great movie.

‘I'm sorry to see laws get broken,’ Fieri said. ‘This has so many other facets that are far more important than my car. My car is a very small portion of it. There's a bigger issue on the table.’

He said the insurance company took ownership of the car after it was found in Wade's possession at a storage unit.

During closing arguments on Monday afternoon, Deputy District Attorney Yvette Martinez told the jury that Wade though he was a celebrity who ‘committed a celebrity crime to get the beautiful blonde girl.’
