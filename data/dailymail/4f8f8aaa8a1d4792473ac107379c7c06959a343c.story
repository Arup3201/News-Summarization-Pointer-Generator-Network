Career criminal: Harry Hankinson, 64, who blames his 501 convictions on a head injury he suffered falling out of a window in 1970

Britain's 'most prolific thief' has walked free from court despite clocking up crime number 501 after five decades of offending.

Harry Hankinson, 64, claims his incredible criminal career started in 1970 because his personality changed when he fell out of a window and banged his head.

The shoplifter says he is now a 'kleptomaniac' and simply cannot stop himself.

Over the years, Hankinson has targeted dozens of shops in his hometown of Bolton and even once took his unsuspecting wife on a shoplifting expedition during a sightseeing coach trip.

Hankinson was hauled before Bolton Magistrates' Court again yesterday after his latest spate of thefts in April and May.

The court heard he snatched £203 of clothes from a fashion store in Bolton, Greater Manchester, £295 of perfume from Boots, toiletries worth £350 from Debenhams, and £8 of chocolate from Pound Empire in Manchester.

He also walked into a branch of the Body Shop in Blackburn town centre and asked staff if the shop sold any expensive perfume - then stole the £42 gift set pointed out to him by a store assistant.

Hankinson, from Halliwell, Bolton, admitted five charges of theft over his £900 spree and admitted: 'I'm ashamed of myself'.

He was given a four-month prison sentence, suspended for 18 months after JPs told him: 'We want to help you', to the fury of his victims.

After the case Anwar Fozdar, 52, manager of the Pound Empire in Manchester which was raided by Hankinson said: 'This guy should be in prison not get wrapped up in cotton wool and molly-coddled by some probation officer.

'Shoplifters cause us nothing but misery and at this guy's age, a leopard is never going to change his spots.

'I just cannot understand how someone can get off scot fee when he's committed over 500 offences. What more does it take to get locked up?

'We get loads of shoplifters coming in stealing toiletries because they see this crime as easy to do and knowing they'll probably get a soft sentence if they are caught.

'We lose on average at least £100 a month because of crime - maybe more and its causes us all sorts of economic problems. Giving this man help rather than prison just sends out the wrong message - and tells people shoplifting is not taken seriously.'

The court was told that over the last 43 years, Hankinson had 416 convictions for theft, seven offences of violence, four sexual offences, two offences 
against property, 28 relating to police courts and spells in prison, 
three drug offences and 36 'miscellaneous' crimes.

The record is thought to make him Britain's worst offender.

In 1996 his offending became so prolific his long-suffering wife Linda, then 46, spoke out to condemn an 18-week stretch he received for stealing cigarettes, spirits and groceries.

She said: 'He should have got at least 18 months. The only way he will stop is by being in prison. If he's in there long enough he might stop and think and get some proper help while he's locked up.

'When he's out after short stretches its just too easy for him to go and do it again. A psychiatrist has told me that he's a kleptomaniac, I don't think there's much doubt about that.'

But although she vowed to stand by her man, in 2008 Mrs Hankinson was unwittingly caught up in another thieving expedition when she and her husband went to Ripon, North Yorkshire, for a day out by a coach - to celebrate his release from another prison stretch.

While browsing around the shops in the historic market town, light-fingered Hankinson helped himself to more than £1,000 worth of jewellery from two shops after telling staff he had won the Lottery.

He then took jumpers and biscuits while waiting at Edinburgh Woollen Mill shop for his wife to meet up with him.

In mitigation, his lawyer Stephen Teasdale said: 'All this behaviour is impulsive or compulsive. There's nothing sophisticated. There's no planning, he goes straight into the shop, picks up a select three or four items then walks out.

'There's no violence or damage to the shop. There are many many convictions of shoplifting but there is no violence or damage and normally items are recovered all of the time.'

He said the defendant's personality changed after an accident in 1970.

'He decided to attend a family function and the windows were open, they were the type you could pull up. He fell out backwards and it wasn't a ground floor window.

'That has changed his personality. A psychologist is going to be most help to him.

'He doesn't steal from vulnerable victims - every time it is a large retailer - like Boots and Asda. He has a long suffering sister who has supported him. His sister does his shopping. He does not want to go to shops and be around temptation.'

Chairman of the magistrates Nat Ayisi-Biney also ordered Hankinson to comply with a electronic curfew between 10am and 5pm for six months and to pay an £80 victim surcharge.

Mr Ayisi-Biney told Hankinson: 'It's up to you now, we want to help you.'
