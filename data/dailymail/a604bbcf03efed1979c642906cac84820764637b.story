Super-rich investors flocked to auctions this year to make world record purchases on everything from classic cars to embroidery and stamps.

With interest rates low and a lack of trust in banks, wealthy people have been looking for ways to get decent returns on their money.

As a result, more and more are visiting the likes of Bonhams, Sotheby’s and Christie’s to bid on assets they can enjoy and profit from.

High price: 'Still Life, Vase with Daisies and Poppies' was one of only a few Vincent van Gogh pieces to be offered publicly in decades. The 1890 piece, painted shortly before his death, was offered with an estimate of £19million. It ended up selling for £40million, a record for a still life painting by the artist

Tick tock: The Henry Graves Supercomplication, a Patek Philippe watch regarded as the Holy Grail of Timepieces sold for a world record £15.1million at a Sotheby’s sale in November. This was a £5.5million increase on the £9.6million it sold for in 1999 - itself a world record

Astonishing rise: A very rare, 19th century stamp from British Guiana was sold for a record-breaking £5.6million at Sotheby’s sale in June. This is almost one billion times its original face value

Auctions houses have achieved world record prices for classic cars, watches, paintings, drawings, stamps and vases.

A very rare, 19th century stamp from British Guiana was sold for a record-breaking £5.6million at Sotheby’s sale in June. This is almost one billion times its original face value.

Sotheby’s also set a world record for the most expensive wine lot. 

At a sale in Hong Kong, in October, 114 bottles of Romanee-Conti Superlot sold for £1million - working out a more than £1,100 per glass.

John Collins, who runs classic car dealership Talacrest, paid a record-breaking £518,000 for the registration plate 25 O in November. 

Top car... for a top price: At Bonhams’ Monterey sale in August, a Ferrari 250 GTO - one of just 36 built - was sold to a British-based collector for a world record £22.8million. It was also a record year for RM Auctions as company, with the auction house selling £300million worth of classic cars. The sales were led by Ferraris

More than expected: Poise, a piece by Scottish artist John Duncan Fergusson’s which was discovered in a French attic, sold for £638,000 at a Christie’s sale - five times its initial estimate

Specialist: John Collins, who runs classic car dealership Talacrest, paid a record-breaking £518,000 for the registration plate 25 O in November.

The registration plate is going on his Ferrari 250 SWB, but it could easily go on the world’s most expensive auction car, the Ferrari 250 GTO.

At Bonhams’ Monterey sale in August, a 250 GTO - one of just 36 built - was sold to a British-based collector for a world record £22.8million.

Gooding and Co and RM Auctions also set records for different Ferraris during the same week, with another Briton paying £6million for Steve McQueen’s old Ferrari 275 GTB.

It was also a record year for RM Auctions company, with the auction house selling £300million worth of classic cars.

The firm’s sales were led by Ferraris, which have outdone just about every asset over the past ten years with prices rising by more than 400 per cent.

Mr Collins has only worked for five months this year and but has racked up sales of more than £70million. Despite his incredible year, he employs just one other person, his secretary. 

Astonishing price: In November, a Chinese billionaire paid £28million for a silk embroidery - a world record for any work of Chinese art. The 600-year-old thangka, from the Ming dynasty Yongle period, depicts the majestic Raktayamari, the red Conqueror of Death, embracing his consort, Vajravetali

Whopping sale: The thangka was only expected to fetch £6.5million but sold for more than four times that figure at a Christie’s sale in Hong Kong (above)

Willy, nilly, silly old bear: A drawing, by EH Shepard, of Winnie the Pooh sold for £314,500 - three times its estimate and a world record for an illustration when it was auctioned in London earlier this month

 

‘Still Life, Vase with Daisies and Poppies’ was described as the most important painting of its kind to go on the market in two decades.

It was produced by the Dutch artist in 1890 at the house of his close friend Dr Gachet near Paris - not long before he shot himself with a revolver, aged 37.

Van Gogh painted just a few hundred works in his career, the majority of which are now displayed in museums. The artist is believed to have suffered from bipolar disorder, where manic episodes of high energy and creativity succumbed to spells of depression.

The painting was seen as particularly poignant because Van Gogh picked the flowers for the picture from the meadows where he is thought to have shot himself the following month.

And the classic car dealer expects the ‘crazy’ market to continue and has just taken two 1960s Ferrari prototype race cars into stock - with each model for sale for £15million.

He said: ‘In 2008, before the collapse, you were getting £700,000 in interest for every £10million in the bank but that soon disappeared. Now all people want is assets.

'The car and art markets in particular have gone crazy. People are scared of banks. They are scared they could collapse and they would lose their millions so they would rather have assets.

‘A right-hand drive Ferrari 250 Lusso, which is a run-of-the-mill classic Ferrari, has gone from £300,000 to £2.25million since 2007.

‘Ferraris are like then Chanels and Warhols of the car world. 

'You might get one person looking at a classic Jaguar, but you’ll have ten looking at each Ferrari. They are the leaders.’

Classic cars aren’t the only ‘boys’ toys’ doing the business at the auction house.

The Henry Graves Supercomplication, a Patek Philippe watch regarded as the Holy Grail of Timepieces sold for a world record £15.1million at a Sotheby’s sale in November. 

This was a £5.5million increase on the £9.6million it sold for in 1999 - itself a world record. 

Classic: A British car collector paid £6million for Steve McQueen’s old Ferrari 275 GTB. The actor bought the car while filming police drama Bullitt. In the film, his character is followed in his 1967 Ford Mustang Fastback by a black Dodge Charger in one of the best car chase scenes in Hollywood history

Flower: Georgia O’Keeffe’s iconic ‘Jimson Weed’ of 1932 more than tripled the previous record for a female artist when it was sold by Sotheby’s for £28.4million at a New York sale in November

The 1856 British Guiana One-Cent Magenta sold in June in New York, which was the fourth time it had broken the auction record for one stamp in its long history.

Measuring 1in-by-1 1/4in, it had not been on public view since 1986 and is the only major stamp absent from the British Royal Family's private Royal Philatelic Collection.

The last owner was John E. du Pont, an heir to the du Pont chemical fortune who was convicted of fatally shooting 1984 Olympic champion wrestler David Schultz in 1996.

Printed in black on magenta paper, it has the image of a three-masted ship and the colony's motto, in Latin: 'we give and expect in return.'

It went into circulation after a shipment of stamps was delayed from London and the postmaster asked printers for the Royal Gazette newspaper in Georgetown in British Guiana to produce three stamps until the shipment arrived: a 1-cent magenta, a 4-cent magenta and a 4-cent blue. 

While multiple examples of the 4-cent stamps have survived, only the tiny 1-cent issue is known to exist today. 

Artwork has continued to set records as well. ‘Still Life, Vase with Daisies and Poppies’ was one of only a few Vincent van Gogh pieces to be offered publicly in decades.

The 1890 piece, painted shortly before his death, was offered with an estimate of £19million. It ended up selling for £40million, a record for a still life painting by the artist.

Poise, a piece by Scottish artist John Duncan Fergusson which was discovered in a French attic, sold for £638,000 at a Christie’s sale - five times its initial estimate.

The year of 2014 also saw the emergency of female power players in the art market, according to Sotheby’s, with a surge in appreciation for works by woman.

Georgia O’Keeffe’s iconic ‘Jimson Weed’ of 1932 more than tripled the previous record for a female artist when it was sold by Sotheby’s for £28.4million at a New York sale in November.

A drawing, by EH Shepard, of Winnie the Pooh sold for £314,500 - three times its estimate and a world record for an illustration when it was auctioned in London earlier this month.

In November, a Chinese billionaire paid £28million for a silk embroidery - a world record for any work of Chinese art.

The 600-year-old thangka, from the Ming dynasty Yongle period, depicts the majestic Raktayamari, the red Conqueror of Death, embracing his consort, Vajravetali.

It was only expected to fetch £6.5million but sold for more than four times that figure at a Christie’s sale in Hong Kong.
