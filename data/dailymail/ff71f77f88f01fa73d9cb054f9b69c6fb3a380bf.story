Popular: Rosie Whitaker, who once performed at London's Royal Opera House, was a 'popular, beautiful girl who brought joy to everyone through her various talents'

A distraught family are calling for a ban on anorexia and suicide websites following the death of their daughter.

Her family believe Monday night’s tragedy came from reading and writing on websites where girls idealise slim celebrities such as Kate Moss, while describing how they cut themselves and contemplate taking their own lives.

In a blog, Rosie, a talented ballet dancer, spoke of her struggles with bulimia, her compulsion to slash herself with a razor blade and plans to kill herself. Callous strangers responded by telling the clearly underweight girl she was fat and urging her to commit suicide.

In April, Rosie wrote: ‘This girl just told me to go kill myself. I don’t even know what to do. I’m sitting here crying my eyes out, praying that the people around me will be okay.

‘Praying that I won’t pick up a blade. I just don’t understand how someone could say that, say that to someone who has been planning their suicide for almost 3 weeks.’

On Monday night – a couple of hours after writing on her blog ‘I’m so f****** sorry’ – the teenager appears to have carried out her plan to end her life. She was pronounced dead on the rail line close to her home in Beckenham, south-east London, after being hit by the Victoria to Ramsgate train.

The tragedy, and Rosie’s family’s planned campaign against the offending websites, will add to concern about online communities that encourage vulnerable youngsters to starve themselves and take their own lives.

Dr Alice Cole-King, a psychiatrist, said: ‘There is a growing body of evidence that vulnerable and distressed people can be unduly influenced by suicide and self-harm promoting websites.’

Rosie’s family issued a statement yesterday saying: ‘She was a popular, beautiful girl who brought joy to everyone through her various talents, including dancing and performing at the Royal Opera House, diving, writing poetry and piano playing.

‘For most of her life, she was very happy and planned to follow a career in which she would help others.

‘She was a well-balanced and well-loved young lady who had everything to live for.

Tributes: Friends of Rosie left flowers and notes at Beckenham Station in tribute to the schoolgirl

You'll never be forgotten: One of Rosie's friends left a note expressing her sadness at the schoolgirl's death

‘However, during a period of stress 
brought on by the pressures of conforming to her peer group and studying
hard for GCSE exams, it appears she was, unfortunately, heavily 
influenced by websites and online communities promoting self-harm and 
suicide.

‘We hope her tragic death serves as a 
warning to other impressionable youngsters and their parents that such 
sites pose grave risks.’

A British Transport Police spokesman 
said Rosie’s parents were planning to launch a campaign against suicide 
and self-harming websites.

‘The websites she was looking at are things we will be examining as we compile a report for the coroner,’ he added.

According to her blog, Rosie, who was 
an army cadet, had been plagued by thoughts of death, and false beliefs 
that she was fat and unattractive.

It appears she had given up her habit 
of obsessively cutting herself with a razor blade, but an apparent 
relationship break-up seems to have tipped her over the edge.

She also repeatedly referred to her weight and starvation attempts.

Rosie posted numerous photographs of 
excessively thin models – some distorted to make the women even more 
skeletal than in reality – and others of arms slashed by a razor blade.

She spoke of having obvious wounds she had to hide from her mother.

In the heading of her blog are the 
words ‘And then she broke’, beneath which she declared: ‘Rosie, 15, 
London. Recovering. I have a s*** blog and everything
is just s***.’

Rosie's dancing achievements had included performing at London's prestigious Royal Opera House

Following her death, a friend wrote on the front page of her blog: ‘Unfortunately Rosie passed away on June 11 2012.’

‘Rosie was a very talented student who excelled at music, diving, dance and creative writing.

‘She was an inspiration to those who 
taught her as well as those who learned with her. More importantly, she 
was much loved by students as well as staff.

‘Our thoughts are with her family and friends at this very difficult time.’

Friends of Rosie and others left 
tributes to her on memorial pages online, with close friend Bryony Wilde
writing: ‘You are at peace now, and I will remember every single moment
I spent with you when you filled my life with happiness.

‘You are a kind, clever, amazing, talented, sweet girl and I will never forget you. Rest in peace, baby, remember, I love you.’

This article has been amended to make clear that the statement came from Rosie's family, not just her parents, and to remove photographs of Rosie and comments from her blog following representation from her family.
