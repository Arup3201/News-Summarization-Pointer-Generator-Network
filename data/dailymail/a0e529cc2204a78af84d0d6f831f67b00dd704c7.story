A former daycare owner has been charged with murder after a three-year-old boy accidentally hanged himself on twine while going down a slide.

Janna Thompson was indicted for second degree murder and child cruelty following the death of Thomas Maxwell Stephens, in July.

The toddler died from asphyxiation after he was left on the playground of Ms Janna's daycare in Alpharetta, Georgia, unsupervised. 

Charged: Janna Thompson was indicted as a result of the death of Thomas 'Max' Maxwell Stephens, who died on a slide at a daycare centre in Alpharetta, Georgia

He and his classmates were in the playground when police believe his head became tangled in the loop of twine. 

The tragic incident unfolded three months after the residential home, which Ms Janna had been operating for 25 years, was deemed unsafe.

On the day of the boy's death, she was said to have left the him outside as she disciplined another child outside.

At the time, Thompson allegedly had seven children in her care, even though she was allowed by state law to care for only six, according to The Georgia Department of Early Care and Learning. 

'While the children were playing, one toddler began misbehaving,' a court document seen by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution stated. 

'The Provider took this child inside leaving three children unsupervised on the playground. 

'While inside, the Provider used the restroom, received a phone call and made a phone call.' 

Scene: The youngster was playing on the slide when he is said to have become tangled in the twine. He died a day later from asphyxiation 

When she returned, she saw the child lying flat on the slide, unconcious, and dialled 911.  

Police then arrived to find the woman performing CPR on the child  

Her state's daycare licence was suspended the week after the death and she was forced to close it down.  

Thompson had not been charged in connection to the boy’s death until her indictment. But in August, seeking unspecified damages.

Earlier this year, investigators said there was an excessive amount of twine, long tree limbs and pine cones which were a danger to children playing on the site. 

Thompson has reportedly not been taken into custody.  

Unsafe: Ms Thompson had been operating the residential center for 25 years - but her licence was revoked a week after the tragic incident
