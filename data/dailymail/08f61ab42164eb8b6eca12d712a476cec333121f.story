The majority of the Nicaraguan gold miners trapped underground have now been rescued.

The 28 'guiriseros,' or informal gold miners were trapped 2,600ft underground on Thursday morning when a shaft at the El Comal mine collapsed after heavy rains.

The mine is located near Bonanza, a town perched on the side of a hill 260 miles north-east of the capital Managua. The miners were not directly employed by the mine owners, Colombian firm Hemco.

Rescuers began digging out the men on Friday after they had been underground for 24 hours.

Hemco said it had recently found the mine was unsafe and told the miners not to enter after two men died in a landslide last month.

The rescued miners were  dehydrated but otherwise unharmed said Deputy Interior Minister Carlos Najjar.

Emergency crews used a pulley system in a narrow tunnel to bring the first two miners Roger Darse and Abel Herrera to safety.

Two more miners had been buried near the surface and managed to dig themselves out.
