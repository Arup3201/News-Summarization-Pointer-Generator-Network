Dominic Thiem recorded one of the best and one of the worst victories of his life in the second round of the US Open.

The 20-year-old Austrian is among the most exciting young talents around and he made the last 32 at a grand slam for the first time by coming from two sets down to defeat 11th seed Ernests Gulbis 4-6 3-6 6-4 6-3 6-3.

But it was not a match he enjoyed because Gulbis is his training partner and mentor.

Good friends: The pair train together and Thiem says he did not enjoy beating his Latvian friend

The pair share a coach in Gunter Bresnik and travel the world together. They even warmed up together before Friday's match, but that was all that was normal about it.

'I hated the situation,' said Thiem.

'It's something really, really special, it's a really great win for me. It's my first time coming back from two sets to zero, first time five sets.

'But I would prefer it against anybody else.'

Gulbis appeared to have the match in his grasp but struggled with cramp in the fourth and fifth sets.

He said: 'A lot of my energy went on the mental part, the nerves that started before the match. Probably if I would play somebody else, I would be more relaxed.

'I thought that it's not going to be so difficult, but mentally it was difficult. We were both really nervous throughout the match. We both played far from our best tennis.

Eyes on the prize: Diem, 20, stayed strong physically and mentally to reach the last 32 for the first time

Distraught: Gulbis has been unable to replicate his French Open form since reaching the semi-final in Paris

'The level we play in practice is much higher than we did today. This was not a nice game. But he showed character, so it's really good. It's good for him.'

Thiem next plays 19th seed Feliciano Lopez, and Gulbis hopes his friend can keep his run going.

'The positive is that Dominic is in the third round,' said the Latvian. 'He has an okay draw, so I wish him the best.

'I lost. I'm going home. Nothing is positive for me.'

Gulbis was once where Thiem is now as a bright young thing of the tour, but he enjoyed life away from the court too much to realise his potential.

Over the last two seasons Gulbis has grown up and knuckled down and the results have followed, the highlight being a run to the French Open semi-finals this summer.

Since Paris, though, he has won just four matches in five tournaments, slipping out of the top 10 almost as soon as he climbed into it.

Feeling the heat: Despite a good start the Latvian was unable to close out the game, blaming mental fatigue

'At Wimbledon definitely I was a little bit overwhelmed from my Paris results,' he said. 'It was tough for me.

'Afterwards I took some time off. Then I had a good two weeks of practice.

'I did my homework. I was working hard. I was working good. Everything was good. You never know when the results are going to come.

'Unfortunately now is a grand slam. Everybody wishes that his top form is coming for the grand slam. Mine didn't come.

'Now I have to look forward to Asia. If I play really, really well, I still have a chance for the World Tour Finals. I just need to win something big. But it's good. It's okay. A loss is a loss, but it's fine.'
