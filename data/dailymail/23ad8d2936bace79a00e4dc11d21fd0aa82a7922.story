The Center for Disease Control and Prevention has drawn up a six-page action plan on how to tackle Ebola, warning US hospitals: 'now is the time to prepare'. 

It comes a week after the organization warned the disease is 'out of control', as it emerged a CDC worker has contracted the illness.

World leaders have pledged to invest millions in health care in Liberia, where the disease is expected to rage for another 18 months at least.

Urgent: The Center for Disease Control and Prevention has issued an Ebola checklist to all American hospitals as it warns the disease, which is 'out of control' in a number of African countries could soon reach the US

But experts believe urgent work must be done at home as it is only a matter of time before the illness is widespread across America. 

Drawing up a three-stage plan for both small and large hospitals nationwide, CDC chiefs warn the disease has yet to be controlled and 'it is possible that individuals with EVD in West Africa may travel to the United States'.

The checklist, released today, orders doctors and nurses to constantly review their approach to the disease and to place heavy emphasis on training staff.

Every member of staff should be given a 'buddy' to help keep each others' hygiene in check.

And all clinics need to train an employee in media relations in case they have to make a public statement or deal with intense attention. 

It then goes through each way staff can 'detect', 'protect' and 'respond' appropriately to a case of Ebola, also known as EVD. 

There is also a detailed document with diagrams showing staff how to put on and remove their scrubs - that they must study' frequently' to ensure they keep up standards.

Action plan: The checklist is introduced with the warning, highlight in bold, that 'now is the time to prepare'

Detailed: Staff must be paired up in 'buddies' to help them put on and take off their scrubs to keep up standards

Constantly changing: Officials warn staff to 'frequently' check CDC guidelines as they adapt to tackle the illness

The introduction to the checklist reads: 'In order to enhance our collective preparedness and response efforts, this checklist highlights key areas for hospital staff - especially hospital emergency management officers, infection control practitioners, and clinical practitioners - to review in preparation for a person with EVD arriving at a hospital for medical care.' 

It also warns: 'Many of the signs and symptoms of EVD are non-specific and similar to those of many common infectious diseases, as well as other infectious diseases with high mortality rates.'

Last week, CDC chiefs said the world's worst Ebola outbreak is threatening the stability of affected and neighboring countries and a 'massive' response is needed to bring it under control.

Dr Frieden said: 'We're likely to see significant increases in cases. Already we have widespread transmission Liberia. In Sierra Leone, we're seeing strong signs that that will happen in the near future.'

The group, Doctor Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontieres - MSF), also warned on Tuesday that the world is losing the battle against the disease and said treatment centers have been 'reduced to places where people go to die alone' as authorities race to contain the disease.

Doctors Without Borders President Joanne Liu said her organization is completely overwhelmed by Ebola outbreak in four West African countries - Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.

She called on other countries to contribute civilian and military medical personnel familiar with biological disasters.

More than 1,500 people have died across West Africa from Ebola.

A statement from SIM today read: 'Upon onset of the symptoms, the doctor immediately isolated himself and has since been transferred to the ELWA Ebola isolation unit.

'The doctor is doing well and is in good spirits.'

Bruce Johnson, president of SIM USA, said today: 'My heart was deeply saddened, but my faith was not shaken, when I learned another of our missionary doctors contracted Ebola.

'As a global mission, we are surrounding our missionary with prayer, as well as our Liberian SIM/ELWA colleagues, who continue fighting the Ebola epidemic in Liberia. We have gifted Liberian doctors, medical staff and support staff who are carrying on the fight.'

One US doctor, Richard Sacra, is being treated for the disease in Nebraska, where he has received a blood transfusion from another doctor who recovered from Ebola. 

Last month, two Americans Dr Kent Brantly and aid worker Nancy Writebol were released from Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia after recovering from the deadly virus.

The 33-year-old doctor contracted Ebola while working in Liberia, and was flown out of the country along with missionary Mrs Writebol, 59, to be treated.

The two received an experimental drug known as ZMapp and recovered. The manufacturer says it has run out of supplies of the drug and it will take months to produce more.

World Health Organization Director Margaret Chan warned that the outbreak would 'get worse before it will get better' and would require a larger global response.

She thanked countries that have helped but said: 'We need more from you. And we also need those countries that have not come on board.'
