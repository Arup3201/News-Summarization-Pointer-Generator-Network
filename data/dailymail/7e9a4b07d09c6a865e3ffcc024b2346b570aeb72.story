The skyscraper has long been symbolic of a city’s wealth and power – and something that defines a skyline.

Throughout the 20th century, it was New York that held the skyscraper crown. Its skyline was what most people imagined a modern city to look like.

Just 13 years into the new century and although the New York skyline is finally recovering from 9-11, if bigger really is better there is only one direction to head in - East.

Started this year the Kingdom Tower in Jeddah will be the first kilometre high building on earth

The Sky City in Changsa in China's Hunan province is one of a number of super-sized skyscrapers nearing completion in cities across China

The pace of change is so fast at present that DesignCurial brought together a list of the world's top buildings, either completed or under construction, that will be changing the look of the world's tallest skyscraper list at a faster rate than ever before.

The title holder at present is the Khalifa Burj tower in Dubai at 2,716 feet (828 metres), which towers over the building that was for so long the world's tallest, New York's Empire State, which was 1,250 feet originally, but increased by a new antenna in 1950 to 1,467 feet.

The taller of the old twin towers of the World Trade Center was 1727 feet to the top of its antenna, while in London, the Canary Wharf Tower, the old title holder in the UK at 771 feet has just been surpassed by the Shard which is 1,004 feet high.

The Shanghai Tower will be the second tallest in the world when completed in 2014

The Greenland Centre in Wuhan is one of four Chinese super-Skyscrapers planned and under construction

However all these, including the Dubai tower will be dwarfed by the Kingdom Tower currently under construction in another Middle Eastern Country, Saudi Arabia. This building, at the centre of a massive development in Jeddah will be 1,000 metres (3,281 feet) high when completed.

The third supertall building in the Middle East is the 'Makkah Royal Clock Tower Hotel' in Mecca at 1,972 feet, which has the world's largest clock face.

Behind the three middle eastern buildings come a whole clutch of buildings underway across the far east, with four supertall skyscrapers going up in China, towers in Korea, and only one real challenger from the 'old west', in the shape of the Twin Towers replacement in New York, the One World Trade Centre at 1,775 feet.

Mecca's Royal Clock Tower hotel became third highest building in the world in 2012 at 1,972 feet (601 metres) behind only Dubai's Khalifa Burj and China's Shanghai tower

One World Trade Center was conceived as a defiant riposte to the terrorist attacks that destroyed the twin towers

The Goldin Finance 117 tower (named after the company and the number of floors in the building) will be the tallest building in the Chinese city of Tianjin at 1,959 feet (597 metres)

Presently number one in the world, Dubai's Burj Khalifa measures 2,716 feet (828 metres) with 162 floors

Dubai's Burj Khalifa featured in the latest Mission Impossible film, which saw Tom Cruise's character clambering around outside near the top floor

Although taller than the old Twin Towers it still lags behind those developments beginning to carpet Asia on the list.

There’s Shanghai's 'Shanghai Tower' at 2,067 feet, soon to be second to Khalifa Burj (but quickly third behind the Kingdom Tower).

Changsa, in China's Hunan province has planned 'Sky City' for 2,749 feet to take the present title, although this project has run into trouble and delays.

Tianjin city in China, meanwhile, is building the 'Goldin Finance 117' to 1,959 feet, the 'Greenland Centre' in Wuhan, China, is another over 2,000 feet at 2,087 and South Korea is constructing the 'Lotte World Tower' in Seoul to 1,824 feet.

With the activity ever more concentrated in the Middle and Far East it means soon the USA, and New York, the home of the skyscraper, will only have the 'One World Trade Centre' in the world's top ten while the UK won't be anywhere near the top 60.

The Shard is a mere 1,004 feet high - but that's enough to dominate the London skyline
