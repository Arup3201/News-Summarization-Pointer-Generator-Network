When faced with a race against Usain Bolt, Prince Harry knew there was only one way he could ever win. Cheat.

But sadly for the young royal, his tried-and-tested tactic didn’t work the second time he went head to head with an Olympian.

Harry challenged swimming ace Ryan Lochte to a race after bumping into him in the VIP section of the Wynn Hotel’s XS nightclub in Las Vegas on Sunday.

High jinks: Harry, right, challenged gold medal-winner Ryan Lochte to a 
race in the pool of Vegas nightclub XS - and unsurprisingly was beaten 
by the Olympic champ

At 3am, bare-chested but still in his jeans, the prince enthusiastically threw himself into the club’s huge open-air pool.

He was joined by the fully-clothed 
swimmer as friends attempted to carve a path through the pool, which was
full of bikini-clad girls.

Footage shot on a mobile phone shows 
Lochte, who won five gold medals in London, theatrically counting to 
three on one hand as he gives Harry a head start before heading off in 
hot pursuit.

Strangely – not least because he boasts several world records – Lochte only just beat the prince.

The truth, however, was revealed by 
another partygoer on Twitter, who said a fellow reveller had grabbed 
hold of  Lochte’s legs as he kicked off for the one-length race. The 
tactic didn’t quite pay off – though some insisted it was Harry who won.

Lochte, who was in Las Vegas 
celebrating his 28th birthday, told the Mail in a statement: ‘It was 
really fun swimming against Prince Harry. He’s a great guy, and it was a
huge honor [sic] to meet him.

‘I was surprised that he challenged 
me actually. I didn’t know if he had any skills in the pool, but I 
definitely wasn’t going to take it easy on him!

‘He was a great competitor but in the
end it was Team USA all the way to the wall!!  Next time I’m in the UK 
it’d be fun to challenge him to something on his own turf.’

Harry managed to beat Bolt in a 20-yard dash earlier this year – by distracting him at the start.

Earlier that day, Harry had found 
himself surrounded by a gaggle of leggy lovelies who had made a bee-line
for Las Vegas’s Encore Beach Club as news spread that the playboy 
prince was in town.

The 
prince had been filmed enjoying the poolside entertainment at the MGM 
Grand hotel and throwing a lingering glance towards one of the stunning 
bikini-clad women by a camera from television station 'Extra'.

Winding down: Prince Harry jetted out to Las Vegas - known as Sin City - for a little 'rest and recreation'

In white fedora and red floral shorts, 
27-year-old Harry lapped up the attention of his new fan club on the 
latest leg of what has been dubbed his ‘endless summer’ before returning
to the front line as a helicopter pilot.

He also lapped up copious amounts of 
his favourite Grey Goose vodka as well as some of the many cocktails on 
offer in Sin City.

Days after the London Olympics, at 
which he was an official ambassador for Team GB, Harry jetted out to the
US for a little ‘rest and recreation’.

This
took him to Vegas at the weekend, accompanied by two taxpayer-funded 
police bodyguards and his best friend, Tom ‘Skippy’ Inskip.

The
party checked into a £450-a-night suite at the five-star Wynn hotel and
casino for some ‘full-on partying’, as the prince told one fellow 
guest.

The group were seen playing the dice game craps, to the cheering and whooping of their fellow gamblers.

The following day Harry and Co headed off to a £950-a-day poolside bungalow at another Las Vegas landmark, the MGM Grand.

The
hotel hosts raucous alcohol-fuelled parties four times a week under the
brand ‘Wet Republic’, which attract up to 1,600 revellers to its two 
giant saltwater pools.

Outside Harry’s bungalow was a private Jacuzzi from which the prince and his group chatted to a group of girls who had taken the cabana next door and ordered drinks from a menu boasting £65 pitchers of ‘dragonberry’ mojitos.

Just a few bungalows down was singer 
Jennifer Lopez, 43, and her dancer toyboy Casper Smart, 25, although it 
is understood they did not meet the prince.

At one point Harry borrowed a red 
singlet from the ‘bachelorette’ (an America term for hen party) girls 
next door and jumped on a friend’s shoulders, waving his hands in the 
air.

‘They had a blow-up 
whale in their area and were just fooling around, having some drinks and
enjoying themselves,’ an onlooker said.

The
excited ladies couldn’t resist taking to Twitter, posting pictures of 
them posing with the prince alongside giggly accounts of what a 
‘gentleman’ he was.

One member of staff also admitted having ‘creepily’ kept the water bottle from which he had drunk.

The following day the group were in 
the water again, this time at the 60,000 square foot Encore Beach Club 
for another ‘adult pool party’, taking a bungalow with its own infinity 
hot tub.

The entertainment was rounded off with
a visit to the resort’s XS nightclub where other VIP guests included US
Olympic champion swimmer Ryan Lochte.

Harry has recently re-trained as an 
elite Apache attack helicopter pilot and completed a period of 
pre-deployment training with hopes of returning to the front line in 
Afghanistan in the near future.

A spokesman stressed that he was on a private holiday and was not entitled to any more leave than his fellow pilots.

He attended the Olympics in his own time and was not given any special dispensation by the military.

He is expected back in the UK in the 
next few days but will not attend the opening of next week’s Paralympic 
Games owing to his military commitments.
