A public housing project that began as the an architectural marvel by the man who would later design the World Trade Center quickly deteriorated into an infamous slum.

In twenty years, St. Louis, Missouri’s Pruitt-Igoe crumbled into decrepitude and even now, 40 years after the massive public project was imploded, people are asking why.

A 2011 documentary called 'The Pruitt-Igoe Myth,' screening this summer in cities across the country, tells the tale of the hope-filled project’s violent demise.

Hopeful: St. Louis, Missouri's Pruitt-Igoe housing projects began as a symbol of hope for city planners as well as fed up working class residents of decrepit slums of the day

Hopeless: Just 20 years later, the massive project would be in ruins after crime and filthy conditions forced them to be demolished

Pruitt-Igoe was devised as part of the massive urban renewal projects of the 1950s and 1960s.

Previously,
the working class residents of St. Louis had been living in dangerous 
squalor with communal bathrooms and unreliable electricity.

The
city commissioned what they thought was the solution: a 33-building 
modern complex designed by the future architect of the World Trade 
Center Minoru Yamasaki.

Originally
envisioned as segregated housing—the name Pruitt came from a Tuskegee 
airman, while Igoe was a white man—the complex became all-black once 
segregation was outlawed and the whites began fleeing the inner city.

Big idea: Designed by architect Minoru Yamasaki, who would later build the World Trade Center, Pruitt-Igoe was supposed to be the answer to St. Louis's inner city housing problems

Success: And at first, it was. Working class residents were wowed by their new surroundings and the complex embodied the extensive urban renewal attempts of the 1950s and 1960s

Sleek: Though small, the apartments offered comforts and conveniences many residents had never seen

Pruitt-Igoe opened in 1956 to the 
wide-eyed awe of residents accustomed to far less from their housing. 
Green spaces invited their children to play and clean contemporary décor
made residents feel, according to a woman quoted in the documentary, 
like they were in ‘a big hotel resort.’

Marketing
footage from the time of the complex’s opening called it a reprieve 
from the ‘crowded, collapsing tenements’ that many of the new residents 
had grown up with.

Escape: Pruitt-Igoe won residents a reprieve from decrepit St. Louis tenement housing, which had extensive water and electricity problems and trash-filled streets

Stylish: Here was housing that didn't just gleam, it did so in style

Paradise: There were even verdant lawns where children could play

And for the first few years, things 
were good at Pruitt-Igoe and the community there thrived as 24-hour 
patrols kept watch and maintenance crews kept everything gleaming.

But by the 1960, things had taken a turn.

Community: For the first few years, an active community flourished around the ambitious housing projects

Model: For a time, the project appeared to be a success and Pruitt-Igoe looked like a model on which the world's cities could base future projects

Occupancy started to drop as crime rose. Lower occupancy meant less rent going to the city to cover the building’s expenses.

Which, in turn, meant crime went up as fewer patrols were around to keep order.

Changes: But in the 1960s, things started to change. Occupancy rates began to flag but maintenance crews still needed to be paid

Darkening: Vandalism increased and the housing authority even installed special light fixtures that couldn't be broken by kids

Struggle to cope: The city tried to keep up with maintenance and security costs by raising the rents

Evidence: Malfunctioning trash incinerators were never repaired

It also meant nothing got fixed. The once revered project started to decay.

The city responded by raising rents and the tenants who remained weren’t able to afford it.

They striked in 1969, refusing to pay rent until conditions improved and the city eventually gave in.

Backlash: The tenants reacted angrily. They were being charged more and more for progressively worsening housing conditions and held a rent strike

Bitter victory: The city eventually caved to demands for improved conditions, but it was likely too late

Shortly after the 1969 strike, a sewage line broke and flooded units with raw sewage

Gutted: It was the start of a rapid downward spiral

Decline: It was winter and the sewage that poured from 10,000 shattered windows froze in the cold and hung there as a testament to Pruitt-Igoe's failure

But a water main would soon break and
flood many of the buildings and surrounding area with raw sewage. The 
whole thing was declared a disaster area.

Buildings were quickly abandoned by tenants and began to fill up with drug users, criminals, and the homeless.

By 1972, three of the buildings would be demolished. Two years later, the rest would go down, too.

'The Pruitt-Igoe Myth,' by  Chad Friedrichs tells the tale of how the dream of the St. Louis project became a nightmare.

Fleeing: The city would soon declare the flooded buildings a disaster area. As tenants left, crime rapidly moved in

History: Three buildings were imploded in 1972. The explosions would be broadcast worldwide and create and enduring and negative image of the once great project

Finished: Two years later, the rest of the buildings would be demolished and Pruitt-Igoe would be no more

Rapid: The 55 acres on which the complex was built were bare again, just 20 years after the hopeful undertaking began

@highlight

It was created out of a city's hope and the ingenuity of the same architect who would later design the World Trade Center, but America's most ambitious public housing project went out with bang just 20 years after its 1956 opening
