Hundreds of mourners wore Kevin Ward Jr's racing colors to say farewell to the young driver at his funeral today, five days after the driver was killed
 by NASCAR champion Tony Stewart.

Extra chairs had to be placed inside the 700-seater auditorium for his funeral at South
 Lewis Senior High School in Turin, New York - where Ward Jr., 20, graduated just two years ago.

Standing in front of a large orange and white flower arrangement in the shape of a number 13 - Ward's racing number - friends and family remembered the kind-hearted, talented driver.

His sisters said they often joked that Ward was 'spoiled rotten' as the only boy in the family, but that he had a 'caring and loving soul'.

Pained: Somber friends gather outside the high school following the service before heading to the burial

'We love you and you will never 
be forgotten,' his sister Kayla Herring said, Syracuse.com reported.

'If there wasnâ€™t a dirt track in heaven before, there sure is now. From all of us, Kevin, please watch over us. Drive fast. Turn left and Godspeed. You will never be forgotten.'

Earlier,
 she had explained to reporters that she and other mourners were wearing
 orange and white because 'even against black, orange and white does 
shine through'.

During the service, she joked that he wore a cologne he called 'Pimp Juice' because 'the ladies love it' - before she sprayed the cologne over his body, which was dressed in a white suit, the New York Post reported.

Pastor Kevin Westcott, who officiated the funeral service, spoke about how, in 1 Corinthians, the apostle Paul wrote that to win the 
race you must run to win.

'Run
 to win, that exemplifies
 Kevin's attitude in a race car,' he said, Syracuse.com reported. 'How 
we run the race, and who we run it for, is really what's important.

'Kevin
 ran every race with everything he had. Today I want 
to say: Well done, Kevin. He finished well, he won his race.'

After

 more speeches - including jokes at his 'Justin Bieber haircut' - and 
music, the crowd went outside and watched solemnly as Ward's casket 
was carried to a waiting hearse.

They then counted to 13 and released orange and white balloons outside the high school.

Earlier,
 pace cars from the tracks where Ward raced were seen parked outside the
 Trainor Funeral Home, where stony-faced loved ones attended visitation 
hours.

Cars from 
Utica Rome Speedway, Can-Am Speedway and Glen Ridge Motorsports Park 
were among them as well-wishers from the New York racing community paid 
their respects, USA Today reported.

Dale Earnhardt Jr., who lost his father in a racing accident in the 2001 Daytona 500, was among the people who gave flowers.

Farewell: The crowd watches as Ward's casket is carried from the high school after the service

Saying goodbye: Mourners gather for the burial for Ward at the Port Leyden Cemetery after the service

Support: A Kevin Ward Jr. racing sticker is displayed on a vehicle outside the service. A tribute will be held to him at the racing course on Saturday night

Ward
 was killed on Saturday after he got in to a crash at the Canadaigua 
Motorsports Park on lap 14 of a 25-lap Empire Super Sprint race.

A
 video of the incident apparently shows Stewart's car apparently making 
contact with Ward's car before the younger driver's vehicle spins out 
and comes to a stop near a wall.

Ward
 can then be seen getting out of his crashed car and walking towards 
other cars on the track before pointing a finger, apparently at Stewart.

A car 
swerves to avoid him, but when Stewart's car passes close to Ward, his 
right rear tire apparently hits him, and Ward was pulled beneath the car
 and thrown in the air. He later died.

Dean Reynolds, from Empire Super Sprints, told the crowd at the funeral that, in the future, the race will be known as the Kevin Ward Memorial Race. On Saturday, Canandaigua Motorsports Park will hold a tribute to the tragic young driver.

The service came one day after Kevin Ward Jr's family revealed found out that they learned about his death on Facebook.

Confrontation: Ward Jr was hit after he was nudged off the course and walked on the track, pointing his finger angrily at Stewart. Stewart's car then fatally hit him when it came around the track

Kevin Ward 
Sr. said his daughter learned of the heartbreaking news online and broke
 it to him over the phone as they waited for updates in the hospital, Syracuse.com reported.

Mr Ward also expressed his anger at Stewart, saying only he knows the truth of what happened on the track at the Canadaigua Motorsports Park on Saturday night.

'The one person that knows what happened 
that night is possibly facing 10 years in prison. Is he going to say 
what he done?' Mr Ward said.

He said that all the other drivers on the track saw the young man walking - but Stewart still hit him.

'Apparently, Tony Stewart was the only one driving out there who didn't see him,' he said.

Ontario
 County sheriff's deputies, who have met twice with the Ward family, are
 still investigating the crash and are looking at another video of the 
incident.

Questions: Ward's father said that all the other 
drivers managed to see his son walking on the track on Saturday night 
but for some reason, NASCAR star Tony Stewart (pictured) failed to see 
him

Sheriff Philip Povero has said that his 
initial findings have turned up nothing that would indicate criminal 
intent in the crash - but legal experts agree that does not mean Stewart
 is in the clear.

He
 could be charged with second-degree manslaughter under New York law if 
prosecutors believe he 'recklessly caused the death of another person,' 
with negligent homicide another possibility, criminal law professor 
Corey Rayburn Yung of the Kansas University School of Law told the 
Associated Press

After the investigation is completed, the evidence will be turned over to the district attorney. 
Even if he is cleared by prosecutors, though, Stewart could face a civil
 suit.
