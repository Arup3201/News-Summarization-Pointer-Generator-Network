Graeme Souness has urged Liverpool take the Capital One Cup trophy seriously to develop a winning habit at the club.

The Reds welcome Swansea City to Anfield on Tuesday night in the third round and their former manager and captain believes domestic cups represent Liverpool's best chance of silverware.

Liverpool are seventh in the Barclays Premier League and struggling in the Champions League, so Souness sees the cups as a great opportunity for the club.

'This would appear, along with the FA Cup to be their best opportunity,' he told the Daily Star.

'Winning trophies is what you start off as a kid wanting to do.

'First you want to be a professional footballer and then if you are good enough you want to play in a team that can win trophies.

'You can never win enough trophies, play in too many cup finals or collect medals, which would be a new experience for some of Liverpool's players.

'And it becomes a habit. You like that taste and you want it again and again.'
