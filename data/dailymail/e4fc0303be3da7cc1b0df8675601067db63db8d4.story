As the G20 Leader's Summit looms nearer, both protests and security measures continue to be ramped-up in anticipation of next weekend's event.

Up to 200 Indigenous activists from the Brisbane Aboriginal Sovereign Embassy (BASE) took part in a traditional welcoming ceremony at Musgrave Park in Brisbane's south on Sunday afternoon in preparation for their registered protest on Monday.

The group prepared banners and posters for their November 9 demonstration which will be used to protest in favour of Indigenous rights and decolonisation.

The event, which involved up to 200 people, was a preparation for the groups protest for Indigenous rights and decolonisation on Monday

'Today our kids are being removed at rates that dwarf the stolen generation, our people are imprisoned at five times that of blacks in apartheid South Africa, our people are still being murdered by police who get away unpunished, our young people have the world's highest suicide rate and our sacred lands and places are being destroyed and poisoned by mining. 

'All this while the Australian Government and much of settler society refuse to face the fact that this continent has been stolen from First Nations,' Wayne Wharton, a BASE spokesperson said.

The group's protest will come only a few days after 100 anti-poverty activists peacefully lined the Brisbane River on their deckchairs, dressed as accountants.

The protesters, part of the anti-poverty group Micah Challenge, set up a mock tropical 'tax haven' in the central city to highlight the issue of multinational tax dodging which they claim robs $160 billion annually from developing countries.

Security measures continue to be ramped up for the world summit, including road closures 

As world leaders roll into Brisbane, it has been revealed that hundreds of surveillance cameras will be scanning the capital city for the next week.

Queensland Police Assistant Commissioner Katarina Carroll says officers at the new G20 operations centre have already started watching the city around the clock.

She says the cameras are watching Brisbane Airport, major roads, the CBD, South Bank and even hovering above in police helicopters.

Ms Carroll said the state-of-the-art operations centre is 'the envy of all of our counterparts interstate'.

'It's unprecedented as to what footage we will have available to us,' she said.

'So obviously it puts (us) in good stead to ensure that, for instance, the motorcades are very, very safe.'

The size of the world leaders' motorcades are also still being negotiated, but Ms Carroll said some were very long, which would be difficult to work with in the CBD.

'That's still in negotiation, and certainly from our point of view if it was smaller it would be easier to work with, but obviously that discussion happens with prime minister and cabinet initially and then with the Queensland Police Service,' she said.

Dozens of police tactical commanders are based at the new operations centre, including those in charge of public order, special emergency response, motorcades, route security and bomb searches.

Ms Carroll said hundreds of local, interstate and New Zealand police have also briefed on procedures over the weekend.

BASE's protest will come only a few days after 100 anti-poverty activists peacefully lined the Brisbane River on their deckchairs, dressed as accountants

There is now believed to be about 6000 police, including 1500 from interstate and New Zealand, who will patrol the area until November 17.

A large swathe of central Brisbane was declared a security zone on Saturday, creating a security buffer around areas like hotels where delegates will stay, as well as the convention centre where the summit will take place.

Under the G20 (Safety and Security) Act, police will be granted the power to search people within the declared zone if they suspect them of having prohibited items such as firearms, knives and explosives, and even eggs, kites and glass jars.
