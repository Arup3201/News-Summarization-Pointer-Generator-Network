Parents in Alabama have cause for concern, after the release of a new report which shows more teachers are arrested in their state for having sex with students than anywhere else in the nation. 

The report was compiled by Terry Abbott, a former chief of staff of the U.S. Department of Education, who spent all of 2014 recording each news report of teacher sex cases in every state - finding 25 in Alabama.

He says that while his report is not scientific, since it draws only on media reports, it shows trends in what is becoming an alarmingly wide-spread issue.

1. Alabama

2. Kentucky

3. Louisiana

4. Vermont

5. Mississippi

6. District of Columbia

7. Texas

8. Utah

9. Alaska

10. New Mexico

1. Texas - 116 cases 

2. Pennsylvania - 45 cases

3. California - 43 cases

4. Florida - 40 cases

5. Ohio - 37 cases

6. North Carolina - 31 cases

7. New Jersey - 28 cases

8. New York - 27 cases

9. Alabama - 25 cases 

10. Illinois - 25 cases

Another factor that influences the data is the difference in states laws. In some states, like Michigan, it's illegal  for a teacher to engage in sexual relations with a student, no matter what the student's age. 

In other states the legislation is more lax, with relationships not being a crime if the student is over 16, as is the law in Wyoming. 

Therefore, there are likely to be more reported cases of teacher-student sex cases in Michigan than Wyoming. 

Six of the Alabama teachers DailyMail.com has covered in 2014: 

LaTangela Williams (left) and Jennifer McNeill (right) were both sentenced to prison terms in 2014 for their inappropriate relationships with students. Williams worked as a health teacher at Selma High School where she had sexual contact with a two students. McNeill was a high school teacher and cheerleading coach who had a sexual relationship with 14-year-old boy who was not her student

Substitute teacher Karen Dylan Holt (left) was arrested in July over claims she had sex with a 15-year-old student. Married math teacher Crystal Clowdus (right) pleaded guilty last March for a light six-month prison sentence after she was caught sending nude pictures to a boy at Susan Moore High School

Ashley Parkins Pruitt (left), a married teacher and mother-of-one, was arrested in November on charges she had sex with three different students. Kristina McMillian Kelly (right), a substitute middle school teacher, was arrested last March for charges of raping a student .

Abbott and his PR team at Drive West Communications in Houston, Texas counted a total of 781 cases, which included teachers or school employees who were arrested, charged, convicted or sentenced for such crimes in 2014. 

While Alabama didn't have the largest percentage of cases (Texas took that prize with 116), it had the most for it's population size, making it the state with the highest rate of teacher-student sex. 

Abbot, who was born and spent nearly four decades of his life in the state, hopes his report will help bring chance to Alabama. 

'I want my grandchildren, one of these days, to be safe in Alabama's classrooms,' Abbott told AL.com. 'I think we have to be aware that, as many great teachers as there are in Alabama, we've seen that there are still sexual predators in our classrooms, preying on our children.'

He thinks that one way to combat this issue is by pushing for more uniform laws against teacher-student sex across the nation. 

'Teachers have authority over children every day, so it's very important to protect that relationship, and any teacher who abuses that authority and takes advantage of a child in the classroom, that should be considered a serious crime,' Abbott said.
