Tom Watson hit back at Phil Mickelson after he criticised the USA Ryder Cup captain following their defeat at Gleneagles.

The USA captain was the subject of scrutiny on day one with his picks, and Mickelson joined the critics with a damning assessment, saying that Watson 'strayed from a winning formula' used in 2008.

But Watson said Mickelson's opinion on how he would manage a Ryder Cup team differed from his own.

Mickelson didn't stay with the USA team at Gleneagles on Sunday night after their 16½-11½ defeat.

Watson told Sky Sports News: 'The issue between Phil and myself is basically a difference of opinion.

'He has a difference of opinion where he would like to manage the team and I certainly had my own opinion on how I'd manage the team.

'That's the controversy and that's the issue but I have to say that I'm very proud of my team's efforts. One thing I asked them to do from the beginning was to give absolutely everything they have and they did. They just ran up against a buzz saw.

'The European team was very strong and had four of the top five players in the world. When you play against them, you better be firing on all cylinders and frankly, we weren't so that's it.'

Since their victory under captain Paul Azinger at Valhalla in 2008, the USA have failed to win any of the last three Ryder Cups.

Mickelson explained: 'There were two things that allowed us to play our best that Paul Azinger did.

'First, he got everybody invested in the process. He got everybody invested in who they were going to play with, who the picks were going to be, who was going to be in their 'pod', when they would play, and they had a great leader for each pod. We hung out together. 

Watson was regarded as an autocratic captain and stuck, unsuccessfuly, to his guns through the weekend

'The other things that Paul did really well was he had a game plan for us - how we were going to go about doing this, how we were going to go about playing together, if so-and-so is playing well, if so-and-so is not playing well.

'Those two things helped us bring out our best golf. We use that same process in the Presidents Cup and we do really well.

'Unfortunately we have strayed from a winning formula for the last three Ryder Cups and we need to consider maybe getting back to that formula that helped us play our best.'
