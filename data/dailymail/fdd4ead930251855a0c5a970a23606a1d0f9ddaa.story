We are constantly having the virtues of the first meal of the day extolled to us.

Yet the average Briton is spending juts six minutes and 15 seconds rushing through breakfast each morning, even though the majority (82 per cent) agree it’s the most important meal of the day.

Busy lives and hectic work schedules have been blamed on an increasingly blasé attitude towards breakfast with a worrying portion of the population (15 per cent) forgetting to eat their morning fuel and a further 34 per cent not eating in the AM at all due to inconvenience.

Many of us blame hectic schedules and busy lives for not having time for breakfast

Over a third of Brits (37 per cent) are choosing snooze over food admitting that they would rather have longer in bed than ‘waste’ time eating a good morning meal.

Furthermore, nearly two thirds (64 per cent) of Brits highlighted that if they were able to make more time in the morning, they would be more inclined to make themselves a healthy breakfast.

Breakfast is often cited as the most important meal of the day

It’s not all doom and gloom though, as those who do make the time for breakfast are more likely to do so whilst listening to music, with 86 per cent admitting that listening to music in the morning perked them up for the day ahead.

Weekends see the nation take the most time out to enjoy breakfast, with a lengthy 13 minutes and 2 seconds spent around the breakfast table on Saturdays and Sundays.

Pop music topped the genre chart as the number one morning mood lifter (60 per cent), with Pharrell Williams’ viral hit ‘Happy’ (25 per cent) named as the UK’s ultimate track to accompany breakfast. 

Commenting on the study, neuroscientist Dr. Jack Lewis, co-author of ‘Sort Your Brain Out’, noted: 'Music is one of the very best tools available to every one of us, enabling us to shift our brains into a different gear. Its mood-altering impacts are extremely well supported by decades’ worth of scientific research. Using music to get us into the habit of making a little extra time each morning to give our brains the right fuel to kick start our day can only be a good thing.'

He continued: 'A nutritious breakfast is also brilliant for Brain-hacking, which refers to simple adjustments to our behaviour that get our brains working better. For instance, substituting traditional milk with a product like Oatly (a calcium enriched oat drink) reduces your intake of saturated fats.

'A simple brain hack like this helps you to avoid clogging up your blood vessels in the long run.'

The British Dietetic Association says: 'Apart from providing energy (calories) to kick start your day, a healthy breakfast provides essential goodness or ‘nutrients’ that the body needs such as fibre, vitamins and iron.

'Research has shown that people who eat breakfast have more balanced diets than those who skip it, are less likely to be overweight, lose weight more successfully if overweight and have reduced risk of certain diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes.'

The research by oat-based milk alternative 
Oatly looked into the morning eating habits of the nation ahead of their 
first breakfast festival – BREAK-FEST – where on August 30 the meal will be brought 
back into the nation’s hearts and stomachs through a marriage with 
music.
