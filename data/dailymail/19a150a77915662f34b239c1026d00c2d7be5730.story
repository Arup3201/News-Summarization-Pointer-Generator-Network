Doctor Nazim Mahmood, 34, fell to his death from a penthouse in West Hampstead, London

A Harley Street doctor plunged naked to his death from his £700,000 penthouse flat.

Nazim Mahmood, 34, was seen standing alone on his glass-enclosed balcony before falling in front of shocked passers-by in West Hampstead, London, on Wednesday.

A passing doctor attempted to resuscitate the man but he was pronounced dead at the scene.

After the fall, Dr Mahmood was left covered in just a blanket - in front of the mansion block and a busy Barclays Bank - for more than three hours.

Police, who said the death was not being treated as suspicious, said there were no police tents available to 'shield the body' and apologised for any distressed caused.

Dr Mahmood, a GP, ran Face Clinic London, a chain of medical clinics providing wrinkle treatments such as Botox and chemical peels.

He is understood to have moved into the property in West Hampstead three months ago with his partner Matthew Ogston.

Dr Mahmood was due to unveil another new clinic just yards from his home next week, as business apparently thrived. He already had two other clinics in Soho and Harley Street.

He recently announced on the company’s website: 'We are proud to announce that Face Clinic London are now offering a third location in West Hampstead, North West London.

'From Tuesday 6th August Dr Nazim Mahmood will be running a clinic from 2pm to 8pm. We will be offering Botox wrinkle treatments, dermal fillers and excessive sweating treatments at this location.'

Witnesses described how the naked man had been on the balcony - which is enclosed by a five foot high glass barrier - for only a few moments before he fell.

Emergency services rushed to the scene but were unable to revive the victim.

After the incident, residents were furious that the man was left on the pavement for so long, covered by just a thin red blanket. Mothers were apparently forced to shield their children as they walked past the scene.

The body was finally removed by police later in the evening, who said there had 'no tent available' to protect the man's body.

One shopworker said: 'The body was left outside for hours. I cannot believe they just left it there. It is like he is an animal.'

A man, who gave his name as George, said: 'I know the guy and I used to see him walking past every morning.

Dr Mahmood was one of the doctors behind Face Clinics, a chain offering treatments in three locations across London.

The clinics, which employed five specialists, offer treatments including Botox, skin fillers, exfoliation, sweat treatments and semi-permanent makeup.

Prices for Botox treatments begin at £200, with cheaper procedures from £75 and offers for going with friends.

Earlier this week the chain posted a message online enticing customers to mimic the look of model Cara Delevigne by indulging in a semi-permanent eyebrow treatment.

Customers writing on the site named Dr Mahmood as part of the 'friendly and inviting' clinic who 'put me at ease' before a Botox treatment.

'He was Asian in appearance, always used to wear a suit and tie. I think he might have been rich.'

George went on: 'There were lots of kids walking past. Their parents were making them cross the road so they did not see the poor guy.'

A security guard from a Sainsbury’s opposite said: 'A woman and her child walked out and witnessed the man falling. He landed on the pavement and people rushed to help him. Everyone was in shock.'

He added: 'There was a friend of his, a white guy who looked like he was on something. He looked like he had gone mad. I think the police might have taken him away to calm him down. He was shouting ‘no, no’ and did not seem focused.'

A neighbour, who was present when police informed Mr Ogston of his partner’s death, said: 'He was devastated.

'It is just terrible that this has happened. He seemed like a really nice guy. He was a GP. We did not know them well as they only moved in April.'

Dr Mahmood graduated from the University of Birmingham medical school in 2003 and moved to London a year later.

He worked in a number of teaching hospitals in different specialities including, accident and emergency, HIV medicine, obstetrics and gynaecology and paediatrics, before completing his specialist training as a GP.

In 2009 he founded Face Clinic London with a colleague, Dr Anita Kapoor.

She declined to comment on his death, saying: 'In order to be respectful I would like to be left alone at this time.'

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'The death is being treated as non suspicious at this early stage. Detectives from Camden are investigating.'

He added: 'There was no tent available to officers to shield the body from the public. Officers instead used blankets. We apologise for any distress this may have caused members of the public.'

A London Ambulance Service spokeswoman added: 'We sent two ambulance crews, a responder in a car, an officer and London Air Ambulance to the scene. Sadly the patient was pronounced dead at the scene by the doctor from the air ambulance.'

An inquest will be held at a later date.
