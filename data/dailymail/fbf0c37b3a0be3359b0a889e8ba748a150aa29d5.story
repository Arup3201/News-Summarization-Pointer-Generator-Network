Waterstones have decided to run the competition of a one-night sleepover after a tourist became trapped inside recently

The winners will have their choice of bedtime reading

Hopefuls must answer the question 'if you were locked in a bookshop overnight what book would you read, and why?' and the winners will be drawn tonight.

The eight-storey Piccadilly branch in central London have launched the competition to find ten lucky bookworms to spend Friday night inside the shop after they were swamped by thousands of people who wanted to be locked inside the beloved book stores. 

Waterstones have teamed up with Airbnb on this remarkable competition which includes free reign to wander the stacks, and a full breakfast in the morning.

Rik McShane, Waterstones' retail director said: 'We were overwhelmed by the support on social media for David Willis when he was unfortunately locked in our Trafalgar Square bookshop last Thursday.

'Amidst this however were a great many message from people exclaiming how much they would like to spend the night amidst the books they love.

Tourist David Willis, of Dallas, Texas, told followers that he had been locked inside the Waterstones store in Trafalgar Square for at least two hours

'So we leapt at the chance to give them what they asked for, with the promise that we'd let them out first thing in the morning. '

David Willis, of Dallas, Texas, had been browsing in Waterstones on Trafalgar Square last night when he discovered the shop had been closed and he had been locked in.

He then spent two hours inside the darkened store, desperately calling for help, before he was eventually rescued after he used Twitter to alert the world to his predicament.

He posted a picture of himself behind shutters inside the darkened store with the message: 'This is me locked inside a Waterstones bookstore in London.

'I was upstairs for 15 minutes and came down to all the lights out and door locked. Been here over an hour now. Supposedly someone is on their way.'

In a later post which was retweeted by more than 7,000 people, he wrote: 'Hi Waterstones, I've been locked inside of your Trafalgar Square bookstore for two hours now. Please let me out.'

When he was finally released, he wrote: 'I'm free.'

Twitter users were quick to offer Mr Willis assistance - with some telling him to call police, a few offering him food, and others giving book recommendations to help him pass the time.

Before he had been saved, journalist Gaby Hinsliff said: 'Need my bed but can barely sleep till I know the Waterstones One is free. Poor @DWill_. Hope they give him a book token to make up for it.'
