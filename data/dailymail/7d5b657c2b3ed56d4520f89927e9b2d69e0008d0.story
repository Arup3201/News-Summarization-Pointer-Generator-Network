With heavyweight designer and respected film 
director already on his CV, Tom Ford is one of fashion's most accomplished names.

Now he has added photographer to his list of talents, having shot all the images for his newest fashion campaign himself.

The dapper 51-year-old called on a few of his model friends, Gemma Aicha Refoufi, Herieth Paul, Soo Joo and Zuzanna Bijoch, who pose against a white background in his bold 'Ka-pow' print gowns.

Ka-pow! Tom Ford appears to have taken a style lead from Andy Warhol for his latest campaign

In typical style, the images are rather risque: in some shots the models conceal their modesty with just their hands.

In others, they wear bright eye make-up which has been matched to their eye-catching dresses.

In the menswear ads for Ford's
brand-new ready-to-wear and eyewear collections, models Conrad Bromfield, Juan
Betancourt, and Oli Tyler join forces to showcase the designer's 
classic tailoring which makes the most of more muted colours.

Who are you calling Four Eyes? Ford's eyewear is hugely popular, and this new collection looks set to be no different. All images in the new autumn/winter ads were shot by the designer himself

Ford described the set of images, which were shot in London, as 'cross cultural multi ethnic'.

The photographs make the most of 
Ford's autumn/winter 2013 collection, which won high praise from the 
style set when it hit the catwalk last February.

Styleite's Hilary George-Parkin wrote: 'Ford’s
work is never quite designed with a wallflower in mind, of course, but 
this collection in particular harkened back to some of his most decadent
work for Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent — and then upped the ante (and 
the saturation) by a few notches.'

In the making: The new images will break on the Tom Ford website in August

ELLE’s Rebecca Lowthorpe was equally impressed.

‘The overall effect was of a decadence 
that could only possibly be enjoyed by the world’s most wealthy,' she wrote.

'They will surely love his monochrome
section of patchworked furs and leathers with long swishing fringes, or
the "sportswear"– loosely termed – that included multi-bright floral 
beaded "hoodies".

Suave: The male models showcase the designer's classic tailoring in muted colors

Ford, who gained international fame thanks to his work for Gucci in the Nineties, previously chose controversial industry legend Terry 
Richardson to shoot his campaigns.

This latest campaign is less provocative than seasons past, representing a new direction for the label.

The pop-art inspired ads will hit magazines in August.
