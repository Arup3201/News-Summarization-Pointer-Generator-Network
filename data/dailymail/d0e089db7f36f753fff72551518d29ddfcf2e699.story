As the search for signs of life on Mars gathers pace, scientists may soon be able to turn their focus on a whole new group of planets.

For they have found that there are in fact many more habitable planets in the universe than previously thought.

The traditional starting point for calculating the chances of finding extra-terrestrial life starts with finding planets with liquid water on the surface.

Planets (or moons) which meet this criteria live in the so-called 'Goldilocks Zone', where planets are just the right distance from their sun ("not too hot, not too cold") for water to exist.

But new computer models, presented at this week's British Science Festival, allow scientists to identify planets with underground water, which is kept liquid by planetary heat.

The traditional view: Scientists look for surface water as a key indicator a planet is hospitable to life, like in this artist's impression - but underground water can also sustain life

These planets, they say, could be habitable.

Sean McMahon, a PhD student from Aberdeen University, who worked on creating the model, said: 'It's the idea of a range of distances from a star within which the surface of an Earth-like planet is not too hot or too cold for water to be liquid.

'So traditionally people have said that if a planet is in this Goldilocks zone - not too hot and not too cold - then it can have liquid water on its surface and be a habitable planet'

Prof John Parnell, also from Aberdeen University, said: 'There is a
significant habitat for microorganisms below the surface of the Earth, 
extending down several kilometres.

'And some workers believe that the bulk of life on Earth could even reside in this deep biosphere.'

Going underground: Recent research shows how much life exists within our own planet's interior

The BBC reports that the team are now developing models to predict which planets might harbour underground reservoirs of liquid water - in turn raising the possibility of alien life.

Mr McMahon added: 'If you take into account the possibility of deep biospheres, then you have a problem reconciling that with the idea of a narrow habitable zone defined only by conditions at the surface.'

The team said that even if a planet so far from its sun that that it received almost no solar heat, it could still maintain underground liquid water.
