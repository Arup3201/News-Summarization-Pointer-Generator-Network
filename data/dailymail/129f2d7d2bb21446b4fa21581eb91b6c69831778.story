Manchester United have been linked with summer moves for both Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo. But who would you buy if you could only pick one? We asked our experts...

Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo have both been linked with a move to Manchester United

MARTIN KEOWN - Ronaldo

Bale is a better long-term investment but if you’re talking about a transfer this summer that would make an immediate impact, then it has to be Ronaldo. United have gone from dominating at the top to fighting for fourth. Signing Ronaldo would bring United instant success and put them back on the map. He understands the club and would appreciate the enormity of the task, but he more than anyone else would breathe new life into the fans. What a statement that would be.

NEIL ASHTON - Ronaldo

This feels like a trick question. Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are two of the greatest players we have ever had the privilege to watch. Ronaldo has done it all before at United - and we would love to see him do it all over again.

ROB DRAPER - Ronaldo

There’s no real debate. No disrespect to Bale, but the all-round game of Ronaldo, from his range of skill, shooting, free-kicks, finishing, heading is just better. That doesn’t make Bale a bad player - just not as good. In financial terms you could make a case for Bale being five years younger but I’m pretty sure you could rely on four good years out of Ronaldo.

JOE BERNSTEIN - Bale

It is purely an age thing. Ronaldo is unlikely to be as good in the next three years as he has been in the last three years and as his body language showed last weekend, you wouldn’t want him around if he feared he was in decline. Bale’s game is tailor-made for the Premier League and if his pace was added to the current United technicians they would be champions

RIATH AL SAMARRAI - Bale

No doubting Ronaldo is the better player but Bale has age on his side and is not so unbelievably selfish as a person that he would pout if a team-mate scores.

PETE JENSON - Bale

Gareth Bale, no question. The former Spurs man is only going to get better. Cristiano Ronaldo has peaked.
