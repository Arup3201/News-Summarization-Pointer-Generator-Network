Tragic mother Julie McCabe who collapsed 13 months ago after using a home dye kit

A mother who fell into a coma after colouring her hair at home has died in hospital.

Julie McCabe had been on a life- support machine following a ­suspected allergic reaction to L’Oreal Preference hair dye in October last year.

The 38-year-old estate agent collapsed with breathing difficulties and suffered heart failure and brain damage. Doctors had given her only an eight per cent chance of survival.

She never recovered and died on Thursday. Her family blamed paraphenylenediamine (PPD) - a chemical found in hair dyes - for her extreme reaction.

They were too upset to speak last night but a friend said 'It is an absolute tragedy. They are devastated.'

There has been no definitive link 
made with the L’Oreal product but doctors caring for Mrs McCabe asked 
for the kit and gloves she used so they can carry out tests.

The costmetics giant offered to assist the medical staff with any information and launched an investigation.

Mrs McCabe’s husband Russell, 45, and 
children Luke, 21, and Abigail, 16, had kept a bedside vigil at Airedale Hospital in Keighley, West Yorkshire, where she was given round-the-clock care.

Mrs McCabe dyed her hair every six weeks but had never suffered a reaction before.

On the day of the tragedy she had been rinsing the dye off after the recommended 20 minutes when she began struggling for breath

Her father Keith Miller, 63, said: 'She finished dyeing her hair and told her husband, "I don’t feel well, I can’t breathe". He rushed her to hospital and her heart stopped beating on the way.'

Her family have called for PPD to be banned from home dye kits. Mr Miller said: ‘I promise for the sake of my daughter and other women to get this chemical outlawed in Britain.

'I don’t want this happening to anybody else’s daughter or wife.’

Mrs McCabe’s mother Brenda Miller, 60, said: ‘PPD builds up in your system over time and this is what has caused a reaction in Julie.'

The family have been in contact 
with a hair and scalp specialist who claims that an allergy to hair dye 
increases as a result of cumulative exposure to PPD.

Consultant trichologist Brian Plunkett, who has spent more than a decade researching hair dye allergy, told the Sunday Express: 'This is a tragedy and we have spoken with the family on many occasions over the last very difficult year.

'Allergy to hair dye can happen at any time and skin testing before every colour is essential. Manufacturers must do more to raise awareness and improve protocols of testing.'

A U.S. study has linked exposure to PPD to increased rates of bladder cancer. Under EU rules, in Britain it can constitute six per cent of a hair dye.

It is a colourless compound but it achieves a rich colour when it reacts with oxygen contained in ingredients in hair dye, such as hydrogen peroxide.

The chemical is used in many permanent hair dyes because it binds firmly to the hair and does not wash out.

Allergy to it is rare, affecting one in 250,000 people, and in most cases the effect is a mild rash. But reactions can be severe, causing serious skin irritations or even anaphylaxis.

An allergic reaction does not necessarily start the first time a product is used. It can happen after several uses.

Dye users are told to do a ‘patch test’, applying a small amount of it to their skin 48 hours before treatment every time they use it.
