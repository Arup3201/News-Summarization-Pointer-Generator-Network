Dirty facilities on holiday is the main reason behind why Britons write negative holiday reviews - yet one in four of us fail to mention it while at the resort. 

Accommodation that was 'not as advertised' and 'poor location' are other key reasons that lead us to take to review sites in anger.  

The survey by Schofields Holiday Home Insurance also revealed that whilst 37 per cent of Britons who had a good experience on holiday left a positive review, 69 per cent of those who had a bad experience left a negative review.

A quarter of Britons who aren't satisfied with their room say they don't bother to complain at the time

The survey set out to reveal the reasons why Britons leave bad reviews after going on holiday and discover whether people are more likely to leave good or bad reviews. 

A total of 2,172 UK citizens completed the survey, all of whom were aged 18 or over and had been on at least one holiday (either in the UK or abroad) within the last 12 months. 

There was an even ratio of male and female respondents.

Initially, respondents were asked 'Have you ever had a good holiday?', to which 87 per cent stated that they had. 

Finding out your hotel was 'not what was advertised' leads many to leave a negative review on a website

When asked if they had subsequently left a positive review after a good holiday, 37 per cent  stated that they had. By comparison, of the 43 per cent of respondents who stated they had experienced a 'bad holiday', more than two thirds  had left a negative review, suggesting that reviews are more likely to be left after a negative experience than a positive one.

All respondents who had left a negative review were asked where they had posted their review, with the option to select as many options as they wanted. 

Three quarters said they left the review with the 'booking agents/websites,' followed by 68 per cent who used 'social media' and 56 per cent who posted comments on an 'independent travel advice site'.

These respondents were then asked if they had tried to address the problem(s) whilst on holiday by making a complaint, to which 26 per cent stated that they had not taken any measures to raise the issues during their holiday and potentially improve the circumstance during the time.

Phil Schofield of Schofields Holiday Home Insurance said: 'It's really important to raise your concerns if you can and give the holiday provider a chance to put it right, if you have the opportunity. 

'They might be able to change your accommodation or even upgrade you in order to make sure you have a good time. 

'Most providers, from accommodation to catering, don't want you to have a rubbish time – and they definitely won't want you to leave a bad review. 

'It's interesting to see the top reasons why people complain. They are all really good reasons, in all fairness, and they are things that can ruin a holiday. 

'We would strongly advise that holidaymakers do their research before booking anything; check out the reviews that are already there before believing glossy pages or slick websites.'
