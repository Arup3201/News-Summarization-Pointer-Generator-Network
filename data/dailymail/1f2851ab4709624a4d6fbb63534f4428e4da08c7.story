Two huge new planets spotted by a telescopes in Chile are the oldest planets detected outside our solar system - and have been there since before the Milky Way was fully formed.

Dr Johny Setiawan, whose team found the planets orbiting the star HIP 11952 said: 'If there was once intelligent civilisation there, it would have watched how the Universe started expanding after the Big Bang and how galaxies and the first stars formed.'

The planets are thought to be three times as old as Earth, and were formed 12.8 billion years ago.

A Jupiter-like extrasolar planet: One planet is the size of Jupiter, the other three times bigger. Both are thought to be three times as old as Earth, and were formed 12.8 billion years ago

They are just 375 light years away from our solar system.

They were detected using 'radial velocity', where astronomers watch for 'wobbles' in starlight, caused by the pull of orbiting worlds.

One planet is thought to be as massive as Jupiter in our solar system. The other is roughly three times the size of Jupiter.

If there is life, there, it's liable to be very different from human beings.

Planet formation was not thought to be possible in the early universe, when stars were 'metal poor' - lacking elements heavier than hydrogen and helium.

Setiawan says, 'It's iron abundance is only about one per cent that of our sun. I wonder what kind of 'blood' they have without iron element â€“ at the time, there were almost no heavy elements available.'

The new planets were detected by the European Southern Observatory at La Silla Paranal, Chile, South America

It had been thought that it was impossible for planets to form without these heavier elements.

Setiawan acknowledges that the planets could have formed later in the life cycle of the star - but says this is unlikely.

Usually planets form just shortly after the star formation,' he said. 'Second-generation planets might also form after a star has died, but this is still under debate.'
