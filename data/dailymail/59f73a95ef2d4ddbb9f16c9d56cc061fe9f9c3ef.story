For most men, turning a pot-belly into a rippling six-pack is the stuff of dreams.

But Julius Kieser, 34, turned it into a reality - transforming his physique in a mere eight weeks.

The father-of-five, from Mooloolaba, Australia, who had padded out thanks to a lack of exercise underwent the dramatic transformation.

Julius said he never used to consider what he ate, using his busy lifestyle to justify 'treating' himself (left, before), but now each meal is considered for its nutritional value (right, with his wife Sharny, 34)

Like many working people, Julius said his lifestyle saw weight gain creep up on him.

Although he used to be a personal trainer, and still writes books on fitness, he works mainly as a shadow writer, which sees him spending most of his day sitting at a desk.

'I used to be in denial about how sloppy I had become,' he admits. 'Once I started taking photos, I realised how much I had been lying and hiding from myself. I felt like I was not man enough to be the father of five children.'

'Worst of all, I knew what to do. As a fitness author, who made a living telling people how to stay in shape, one would expect me to treat my body like a temple. But I didn't, I just drowned myself in excuses and denial. And of course a lot of food.' 

A tough financial start to 2014 saw Julius spend more time at work, at the cost of his health.

'I was stressed and needed to work, I didn't even think about what I ate, I just ate what I could. I barely saw my kids, I just worked and worked, substituting sleep with food.'

'Because I lived 'in the moment' and every day I felt I 'deserved' to have a variety of treats and junk food.'

When his father died unexpectedly in June, Julius found himself rethinking his priorities.

'At the funeral I saw my brother, who works much longer, harder hours than me, and he had abs. 

Breakfast: Porridge with milk and honey

Lunch: Whole loaf of bread with chicken and mayo or cheese and avocado 

Dinner: Take away meal 

Snacks: Crackers with cheese, toast  

Breakfast: Egg white and banana smoothie 

Lunch: Can of tuna with tomato and onion 

Second Lunch: White fish with lots of steamed vegetables

Dinner: 400g rump steak

'While I was stuffing my gob with cupcakes, I watched him eat salad. I realised then that I didn't have to choose between health and work. I could fit both in.'

Working out everyday for 30 minutes, Julius, decided to work exercise into his family life, rather than trying to fit it in around it.

'I created a program for myself using periodised strength and conditioning that would allow me to use my kids as resistance, so that I could play with them and get exercise in. Kids make great kettlebell replacements, and even better personal trainers because they won't ever stop asking for "one more rep".'

WEEK FOUR (left) of the transformation sees a marked increase in definition, while WEEK FIVE (right) a clear size difference can be seen in the width of Julius's torso 

He also totally transformed his diet, eating purely for nutrition rather than comfort.

'Every meal is accounted for and calculated in advance, so I don't have any way to cheat. I created a web app that calculated what my calories and macros needed to be in order to get to my body fat goal. Once I had calculated it, I designed a meal plan for the day that I stuck to every single day,' he explains. 

In less than eight weeks, Julius dropped his body fat from an unhealthy 20 per cent to less than 8 per cent, and had the abs to show for it.

WEEK SIX: Daily workouts and a strict diet plan have seen Julius totally change his physique

As soon as he got home, Julius set about fixing his diet, using proven mathematical formulas for fat loss. It wasn't until he combined the nutrition with fast, effective workouts in the back yard that he started to see dramatic results.

Speaking about his new transformed body, Julius says: 'Now, I feel empowered, I have conquered my inner glutton. 

'The weight loss was secondary. I had become far more efficient at work, and as a result of the good food, became a lot kinder with the kids, who I would involve with my exercising. They deserved fun from me, not work related anger.'

He is so enthusiastic about his methods that he has now created the FITdad program to help other working fathers to 'get lean, without killing their kids.'

'Fitdad is part how-to and part documentary. I wanted to show dads exactly how to do it. But I also wanted them to see the suffering and hard work that goes with losing weight. 

'It's not all sunshine and roses, but if I can do it, any dad can.'
