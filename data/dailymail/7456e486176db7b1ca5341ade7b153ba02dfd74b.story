Rebekah Brooks was at home doing a fitness ‘bootcamp’ the day before the News of the World was shut down, a court heard today.

The former editor's personal assistant, Cheryl Carter, 49, told the Old Bailey her boss had taken a  week-off in July 2011 to work with her 'personal trainer', as the phone hacking scandal engulfed News International.

On one of the days Brooks was away, seven boxes, allegedly containing the former Sun editor's notebooks, were said to have been removed from the company’s archives.

The long-serving assistant said: ‘It is Rebekah at home having a personal trainer to train her.

‘That is what bootcamp is, that is what she was doing.’

She said she could recall that Brooks was not in the office because she would not have had time to deal with the boxes otherwise. 

‘Our job was so intense that I could not leave my phone’, she said.

‘So I knew that I would then have time to go downstairs.’

However, jurors have been told Brooks and Carter’s mobile phones were both used near the News International offices throughout that day.

The court also heard that detectives believed Carter been 
promised a new job at a Murdoch newspaper in Australia, if she agreed to 
hide Rebekah Brooks’ notebooks.

She was arrested just 18 days before her family were due to emigrate from the UK, and the subsequent decision to charge her forced her husband, son and daughter to abandon their new life in Australia

Carter told police just three 
notepads and two diaries belonged to Rebekah Brooks in the seven boxes 
she took home, with the majority being old cuttings from her 
time as a beauty columnist at The Sun.

She said a framed West Ham United or Man 
City shirt were also among the possessions, as well as a handful of speeches 
Brooks had made.

Claims: Brooks is said to have been away on the day seven boxes of notebooks were taken from the News International archives

She then explained to officers that up to ten crates of Brooks’ personal possessions were couriered from News International headquarters to a garage owned by her in-laws, and then on to Brooks' home in Oxfordshire a few days later. 

‘At no point did anyone ever say, don’t do this, don’t remove files, don’t do anything'

Carter said: ‘At no point did anyone ever say, don’t do this, don’t remove files, don’t do anything.

‘I
 knew when Rebekah obviously left the company, they then said you 
must not shred anything, you must not remove anything when I sat there 
with the police, I would have been fully cooperative.

‘For my part I don’t think I have done anything wrong, and I don’t see why I am here today.’

Her son Nick, 24, who worked as an administrative assistant at News International at the time, told the Old Bailey how his mother called him up at work and asked him to come to her office on the afternoon of July 8 2011.

He said he went with her and a driver to the archive office to pick up the boxes.

Mr Carter said he and the driver then 
loaded the boxes onto a trolley and into his car. After work, he drove 
back to the home he shared with his parents and left the boxes on the 
landing.

He said he had no 
idea what was in them or what happened to them after he took them home. 
And he never asked his mother about them.

Long-standing assistant: Carter had worked with Brooks for more than 20 years and had built a friendship with her

Carter started at News International on £23,000 as a secretary, rising up to £66,000 as personal assistant for Brooks when she became chief executive of News International.

She described her boss as ‘driven’ and ‘tough but fair’, and admitted she had done Brooks’ Christmas shopping for nearly 20 years as part of her job.

Brooks and Carter deny the charges of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, by removing potential evidence which could have been inspected by police.

Brooks and all the other defendants in the case deny all charges against them.

The trial continues.
