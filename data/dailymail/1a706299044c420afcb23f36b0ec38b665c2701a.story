Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal believes the club's academy will maintain its production line for the first team.

This season Paddy McNair (19), Tyler Blackett (20), Tom Thorpe (21), and Jesse Lingard (22) have made Premier League debuts while 19-year-old forward James Wilson has been given a more prominent role.

Injuries have helped advance the cause of some of those players but Van Gaal is hopeful they will continue their progress and be followed by others.

Near-neighbours City have just opened their multi-million pound training complex and academy in east Manchester in an attempt to produce more homegrown players but Van Gaal is confident United's youth programme will still create future stars.

The club have a rich history of producing young talent, with the Busby Babes in the 1950s and the Fergie Fledglings - including the likes of Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, David Beckham and the Neville brothers - in the 1990s. 

'It should deliver talents for the first team because the youth education is built for that reason,' he told MUTV.

'I hope that I can take benefit of it as a manager.

'I think we have shown at Manchester United that we have belief in young talent and we give them also the chance to show themselves in the first team.' 

United are renowned for Eric Harrison's Class of '92 to turn out the likes of David Beckham and Paul Scholes
