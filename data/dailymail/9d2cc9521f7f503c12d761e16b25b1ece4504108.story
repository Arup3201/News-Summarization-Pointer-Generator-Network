John Carver has warned that Newcastle United will end up ‘drifting’ unless a swift resolution is brought to their managerless status.

Drifting, however, just about captures the mission statement from within St James’ Park - drift from the calm of mid-table waters and wash up in May on Treasure Island.

They do not want to trouble the cruise liners of the high seas, nor do they want to populate the plunge pool which leads to the Championship.

John Carver has urged the club to make a managerial appointment becuase the club are in danger of drifting

Caretaker boss Carver has publicly stated his desire to take on the role on a permanent basis

Alan Pardew said goodbye to Newcastle to take charge of Crystal Palace earlier this month

And that, essentially, is why Alan Pardew chose to go overboard. The new Crystal Palace boss hinted at as much this week, talking of ‘battles won’ and ‘battles lost’ with owner Mike Ashley, at the same time referencing ‘tight financial margins’ and the ‘slow progress’ policy in place on Tyneside.

Perhaps Ashley should be applauded for surveying the seas and deciding that any attempt to pirate the big boys could see his club drown in misplaced ambition – even pursuit of silverware in the cup competitions is viewed as a threat to staying afloat.

But supporters – and Pardew, it seems – have had enough of this Magpie mandate.

Carver himself is a fan. But the caretaker boss – who wants the job on a permanent basis – should be careful when he talks of redirecting his black-and-white ship towards the top of the Premier League - for he'll soon be walking the plank with any suggestion of a European voyage.

‘Success for this club is to get as high up the table as we can. We finished fifth a couple of years ago and that was fantastic. So why can’t we push fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth?’ he said, refreshingly.

‘There’s all this talk about they (the club) are happy to sit in the top 10. No, go as high as you can. Set your marker as high as you can and, if you get there, what an achievement.

‘We’ve proved we’re capable of that and there was the recent run of six wins on the bounce as well.’

Carver admits that Saturday's trip to league leaders Chelsea and next Saturday’s visit of Southampton are serving as a ‘job interview’ for himself.

But what he says off the pitch is perhaps as important as what his players do on it.

Former Lyon manager Remi Garde has been linked with the vacant position at Newcastle

Carver has warned Newcastle that the club is in danger of drifting if an appointment is not made swiftly

He has, however, advised managing director Lee Charnely to avoid a scenario whereby the search for a new head coach drags on.

‘I’ve been in this situation before and if you don’t do something about it in a short space of time you can end up drifting,’ he said.

‘And what this football club can’t be doing is drifting, so a decision has to be made sooner rather than later, for everybody’s benefit.

‘The dressing room is settled at the moment but the longer it goes on it can become unsettled. I’ve been in this situation and it can affect people. You can’ t just let it drift. You have to make a decision.’

Former Lyon boss Remi Garde remains the frontrunner to take charge. Carver says he would be happy to work under any new appointment, but also believes he himself boasts the credentials to remain in control of his hometown club.

When asked if he was the right man to lead Newcastle in the long term, Carver said: ‘Why not? People ask me what my qualifications are – well, I’ve got the UEFA Pro Licence and that’s a starting point.

‘I’ve worked with some of the best people in the game, Kevin Keegan, Kenny Dalglish, Ruud Gullit, Sir Bobby (Robson).

‘If the club said to me, “take it to the end of the season”, then I’d be prepared to do the job, no danger of that. I have enough belief in myself and enough time until the end of the season that they’d say to me then, “you’ve done a good job, keep the job”.’

To keep the job, Carver must run a happy ship. Right now, however, it is beginning to seep a little water and the mood on the terraces during the FA Cup defeat at Leicester was one of mutiny.

Carver, then, is right – an appointment has to be made. For drifting can very quickly turn to sinking the longer a ship remains rudderless.
