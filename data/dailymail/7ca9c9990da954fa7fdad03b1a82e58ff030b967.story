Ravi Bopara is not the sort to fret over his future but if he took time this week while England unwind in Western Australia to glance at what is happening elsewhere then he would have been given much World Cup food for thought.

Bopara still looks certain to be part of England’s opening World Cup line up against Australia on February 14 but, at 29, is approaching the last chance to finally realise the rich potential that has all too often remained unfulfilled.

There is competition both near and far now for an all-rounder whose poor Tri-series is one of the major concerns for an England side who, despite three defeats by Australia, have made quiet progress so far in their Cup build-up.

Ravi Bopara's England form is a major concern ahead of the upcoming World Cup 

The England star, in action against Australia on Sunday, still have so much to prove 

Bopara leaves the field of play on Sunday as Australia celebrate taking his wicket 

Gary Ballance is nearing full fitness after a broken finger and looks set to be given a chance by England to push for Bopara’s place in one of their warm-up matches here in Sydney against Pakistan and West Indies next week.

More seriously for Bopara’s long-term prospects, the spectacular hitting of Ben Stokes for the Lions in South Africa has confirmed the return to form of a special talent who will be an important part of England’s future.

It is frustrating that Bopara, approaching his third World Cup, still has so much to prove as he remains a gifted batsman and a bowler who should provide a valuable option for England, particularly on the slower pitches of New Zealand.

Yet Bopara, who was also under-used in Sri Lanka with the ball before Christmas, was given just three overs by Eoin Morgan during the Tri-series, conceding 24 runs, while Moeen Ali has established himself as fifth bowler.

Bopara managed only seven off 16 balls in Hobart, but his ability should note be doubted 

And if Bopara’s bowling becomes less useful then there will be more scrutiny on batting which saw him struggle for seven off 16 balls in Hobart when England needed acceleration against Australia and play an awful shot against India at the Waca when a cool head was needed.

It was only in Sri Lanka that Bopara was promoted to five and looked to have been given more opportunity to build longer one-day innings rather than just provide cameos at seven or seek to become England’s finisher.

He is back at six now but will find Ballance breathing down his neck if he takes the chance that looks sure to come his way at the SCG next week.

Bopara’s ability should not be doubted. When he was scoring three centuries in consecutive Test innings against West Indies six years ago he looked certain to become a permanent fixture. There have also been spectacular one-day innings for Essex but only one 50-over century for England, and that came against Ireland.

Gary Ballance is closing in on a return from a broken finger and could push Bopara for a place in the line-up

There will be those, like Paul Collingwood, who bemoan the fact Stokes is not with the World Cup squad and able to replace Bopara now but the selectors had little option other than to leave him out when they picked the squad.

The Durham all-rounder’s international form collapsed with both bat and ball after he returned from Australia this time last year and it was when he continued to struggle in Sri Lanka that England, with heavy hearts, omitted him.

What one would say is that Stokes was not helped by being treated as a bowling all-rounder and he showed, not least with his 15 sixes in Pretoria, that he should very much be treated predominantly as a batsman when he returns.

That day will come if England have an injury here or more likely when they start again in one-day cricket after the World Cup when it is to be hoped that Jason Roy and Sam Billings will also feature in 50 and 20 over cricket.

For now England have the squad most would have picked in December and it is hard to argue against it being the right one for the here and now. But the big question is whether Bopara can justify his inclusion in it.
