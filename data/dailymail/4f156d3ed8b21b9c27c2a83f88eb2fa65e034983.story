A 10-year-old New Jersey boy died after being struck and killed by a police cruiser Sunday night, police say.

The accident occurred just after 7pm in Franklin Township when the boy was heading to a sleepover with two of his friends, CBS reports.

One of the boy's friends made it across the intersection at Delsea Drive and Paul Street, a two-lane highway, and when the 10-year-old attempted to do so, he was struck by the cruiser.

While this is very difficult for the young boy’s family it is also very difficult for that police officer involved. It is our understanding that the officer was responding to an urgent call when this accident happened and we support the officer who was involved in this. 

He is very shaken up by being involved in this incident and we are supporting him in this difficult time.' 

A woman who identified herself to NJ.com as a friend of the victim's family described the community as a 'big crew of friends.' 

'Nothing will ever be the same again,' she said.
