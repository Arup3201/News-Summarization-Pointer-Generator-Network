As Noel Shannon lay trapped under her truck after a horrific crash in the mountains of Oregon, the 23-year-old weighed her options, one of which was to use her car keys to amputate her own leg.

The Washington state resident was eventually rescued, but doctors were unable to save her mangled limb.

Last Saturday, Shannon's left leg was cut off from the knee down at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle.

Taste for adventure: On July 5, Noel (far left) traveled to the Walla Walla River country in Oregon to take pictures in a forest

Beauty: The athletic young woman, pictured with her boyfriend, got into an accident after swerving to avoid a deer on a country road

Noel's mother, Christa Shannon, said her daughter's main concern now is to get a prosthetic running leg.

On July 5, Noel was returning from taking pictures in the Umatilla National Forest near Walla Walla River country in Oregon at around 8pm when she saw a deer in front of her 1996 Toyota car.

The 23-year-old made a sharp turn to avoid hitting the animal, which caused her vehicle to roll over several times.

The truck came to rest on the driver's side, with Noel's left leg sticking out the window. She was not buckled in that night.

Her foot was lodged under the door frame, and try as she might, Shannon was unable to pull it out.

That is when she first thought of her keys.

The quick-thinking photographer used the keys at first to try and dig a furrow under the door frame in an attempt to free her foot.

But after 10 hours of work, she was able to make only a small dent in the rock-hard ground.

Hero: Dax McReynolds, a U.S. Army combat veteran, was driving through the Walla Walla area when he spotted Noel bleeding to death on the ground surrounded by flies

As she lay bleeding heavily from her split-open leg, Noel recalled hearing wolves howling, and the thought that sooner or later the animals will make their way to the site of the crash terrified her.

‘She knew she would have to cut off her leg with her keys, a lot of those were little keys and she knew they were not sharp enough to do so,’ Mrs Shannon told Walla Walla Union-Bulletin. ‘So she just had to buckle down and just jerk her leg out.’

Her leg was now in an even worse shape, but at least Miss Shannon was free.

In the nick of time: Doctors were able to repair Noel's artery, but her left leg was beyond mending

The fit and healthy 23-year-old used her good leg to smash the windshield and crawled out of the wreckage.

Noel Shannon used her sweatshirt to tie a tourniquet around her mangled left leg to stop the bleeding and set out to get help.

But Noel was too weak from blood loss, and so she collapsed only about 15 feet from her overturned truck.

‘I couldn't believe it was happening to me and I really thought I was going to die,’ Noel later recalled to KVEW.

At around 8.30am the next day, Dax McReynolds was returning with a friend from target practice in the Walla Walla area when he spotted a 'pile of debris' on the ground next to a flipped-over truck.

McReynolds and his companion, both U.S. Army combat veterans who fought in Iraq, found Noel near death, with 'bees and flies warming around her.'

‘I see this older Toyota 4-Runner coming up the road,’ said Noel, referring to the moment she first saw the two Good Samaritans approach. ‘It was like they were angels from heaven.’

The men loaded Noel into their vehicle and hit the road, hoping to reach a spot where there is cell phone service so they could call 911.

Staying positive: Despite the pain, Noel flashed a smile and two thumbs up for the camera before undergoing surgery last week

Tough decision: Doctors were forced to amputate the woman's leg below the knee because too much of the muscle tissue has died

One last time: Noel, her boyfriend (right) and her family are seen just before the surgery, with Shannon's leg still intact

'But she wanted to go home,' McReynolds said. 'She said she couldn’t afford the ambulance ride.'

When the group finally reached Providence St Mary Medical Center in Walla Walla, doctors were able to repair the artery in Noel's left leg, but they could not save the limb since too much muscle tissue has died.

On Saturday, her family posted several pictures from the hospital showing Noel getting ready for surgery. In one photo, the young woman is seen casting a final glance at her leg wrapped in a bandage but still intact. 

Noel's loved ones have launched an online fundraiser to help her with medical expenses and the costs of a prosthetic leg. The goal is to collect $75,000 in donations.

Christa Shannon, Noel’s mother, wrote on a Facebook support page dedicated to her daughter that prosthetics are very costly and have to be changed every 4-5 years.

Unstoppable: Noel Shannon hopes to resume running one day, and she plans to open a gym for people with prosthetic limbs 

After a tough week following the surgery, Noel is on a road to recovery. She will be released home in a few days and will spend the next six months getting around with the help of a wheelchair and crutches.

Before the accident, the 23-year-old enjoyed running, training horses and riding her Harley Davidson.

Now, Noel's dream is to get a prosthetic leg and open a gym for people like her. 

Miss Shannon’s message is: ‘Just don't take life for granted, you never know when your last day will be.’
