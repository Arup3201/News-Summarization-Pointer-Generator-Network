The body of a British father-of-two lay unnoticed in Russian mountains for eight months after he went missing on a hiking trip. 

John Stiles from Ilkley, west Yorkshire, disappeared during a ten-hour excursion in North Ossettia last November. 

The 52-year-old, who had been working in Russia to help rehouse Chechen refugees, was found dead on July 18 the following year. 

John Stiles died while hiking in the Caucasus Mountain Range in Russia after going to the country as an aid worker. The 52-year-old is pictured with his wife Isabelle and children, Poppy and Hugo

His corpse was spotted when a helicopter noticed a brightly-coloured object on ground. 

An inquest heard how Mr Stiles, an experienced climber, had been working in Grozny as an aid worker for two years before his death after assisting refugees in northern Iraq. 

He and his wife, Isabelle, travelled conflict zones helping those in need before settling in the UK with their children Hugo and Poppy. 

Mr Stiles was climbing the Caucasus mountain range when he died in 2013. A coroner ruled his death was the result of a fall which caused a severe head injury. 

The aid worker had travelled to north Iraq before taking up work with Chechen refugees in Russia 

The father-of-two was an experienced climber, the inquest heard. He died after hurting his head in a suspected fall 

The father-of-two was hiking in the Caucasus Mountains in Russia when he went missing last November 

His body could only be identified by a steelwork in his pelvic area, fitted in 1999 following a hiking accident, by the time it was found.

Medical records provided by his wife matched up the Meccano-like fixture.    

Speaking of her husband's death, Mrs Stiles said: 'John travelled all around the world but this time it was his last journey. 

'We will miss him so much as he was a great man and a very supportive husband and loving and fun Dad.' 

The inquest has been adjourned pending further information from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Russian authorities.
