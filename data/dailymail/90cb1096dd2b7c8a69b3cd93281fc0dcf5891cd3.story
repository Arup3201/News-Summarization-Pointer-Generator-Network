Kevin Sutherland has been accused of knowingly peddling phony examples of some of Damien Hirsts's signature themes

Prosecutors have accused a Miami pastor of knowingly peddling phony examples of some of artist Damien Hirst's signature themes.

But Kevin Sutherland's defence claims he was just an art-market novice who couldn't read red flags about the pieces' authenticity.

Jury deliberations were due to resume today in Sutherland's attempted grand larceny trial following the summing up yesterday.

The case is one in a series of prosecutions surrounding counterfeit works by Turner Prize-winner Hirst.

Sutherland, 46, leads the nondenominational, 200-members Mosaic Miami Church. According to his lawyer, he began dealing in cowboy-related art in 2010 and soon began buying Hirsts, or what appeared to be Hirsts.

Part of a group dubbed the Young British Artists in the 1990s, Hirst is known partly for dotted, pharmaceutical-themed 'spot' paintings and circular, sometimes kaleidoscopic 'spin' paintings.

Sutherland tried last year to sell two counterfeit spin paintings and three bogus spot prints for $185,000 to an undercover officer posing as a 'buyer', though Sotheby's auction house had told the pastor the authenticity of one of the paintings was in question, the Manhattan district attorney's office says.

When the undercover officer asked about potential problems with the artworks, Sutherland said he wasn't aware of any issues, authorities said.

'He had choices he could have made that 
would have brought him to a very, very different place,' Assistant 
District Attorney Rachel Hochhauser said in a closing argument Monday.

But Sutherland said Sotheby's never clearly told him the artworks were fake. He said he didn't ask Hirst's studio for clarification, as Sotheby's suggested, because the authentication process was pricey and because he believed he had an authenticity guarantee from the man who'd sold him the works — an admitted art scammer who testified against him.

'Kevin Sutherland believed the art to be real,' his lawyer, Sanford 'Sam' Talkin, said in his summation.

The case against Sutherland grew from a Manhattan DA's office investigation that also ensnared three other men.

The Laguna Beach, California, gallery owner accused of selling Sutherland the fakes, Vincent Lopreto — who had already served prison time in another phony-Hirst case — and business partner Ronald Bell pleaded guilty to charges including identity theft. They are awaiting sentencing.

Richard Silver, a part-time art dealer who said he unwittingly bought phony Hirst prints from Lopreto but then doctored appraisals to resell them, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor forgery charges, in exchange for a 60-day jail sentence.
