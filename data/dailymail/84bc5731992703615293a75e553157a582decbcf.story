The college administrator at the California Christian college where a gunman went on a deadly shooting rampage said yesterday she believed that she was the intended target - but had been  teaching elsewhere that morning.

Ellen Cervellon said alleged shooter One Goh, 43, dropped out of the nursing program at Oikos University in November but had returned to the Oakland campus several times to demand a full tuition refund from her.

Ms Cervellon said Goh was furious when she told him that the school could not refund all his money because he had been enrolled for nearly half of the program.

Police had previously said Goh was seeking a female administrator when he went to the college campus on Monday.

When Goh was told the woman was not on at the college, he began shooting indiscriminately in classrooms.

He killed six students and a school receptionist while wounding three others.

The coroner's office named the
 victims as Judith Seymour, 53, of San Jose; Lydia Sim, 21, of Hayward 
and 33-year-old Sonam Chodon of El Cerrito.

Oakland Police Chief Howard Jordan first confirmed Wednesday that Ms Cervellon was the apparent target, but late in the day he said investigators believe another female administrator instead was targeted.

He declined to say why police believe the other school official was targeted and would not identify her. 'She is terrified,' he said.

Grace Kim, 23, of Union City; Doris 
Chibuko, 40, of San Leandro and male victim Tshering Rinzing Bhutia, 38,
 of San Francisco, also died.

School secretary Katleen Ping, 24, was also shot dead at the Oakland school.

In talking to several of the students 
and faculty who were there, I think he was looking for me. I have that 
weight on my shoulders and I don't know what to do with it.

Ms Cervellon said: 'In talking to several of the students and faculty who were there, I think he was looking for me.

'I have that weight on my shoulders and I don't know what to do with it.

'Every single one of those students were going to be an excellent, excellent nurse. They're in my heart and they always will be.'

Ms Cervellon said she was not on campus that morning because she was doing her other job, teaching nursing to students at California State University in East Bay.

Oakland Police Chief Howard Jordan told 
reporters yeterday that Goh was angry after being expelled from the 
school, but Ms Cervellon said he was never expelled and decided to leave
 on his own.

Victim: Grace Eunhae Kim, 23, was killed in the shooting at the Christian college in Oakland, California

She said: 'He was never forced out, he showed no behavioral problems, and he was never asked to leave the program.

'He decided on his own to leave the program.'

Prosecutors charged Goh with seven counts of murder today after the massacre at the college.

The 43-year-old was also charged with three counts of attempted murder.

He also faced a special circumstance allegation of multiple murders that could make him eligible for the death penalty.

Goh surrendered to authorities on Monday, an hour after the attack at Oikos University that left seven dead and three others wounded.

Police said in court documents that Goh admitted to bringing a .45-caliber handgun to Oikos along with four magazines of ammunition. The documents said he acknowledged shooting several people before fleeing.

Goh was scheduled to make his first appearance in Alameda County Superior Court on Monday.
