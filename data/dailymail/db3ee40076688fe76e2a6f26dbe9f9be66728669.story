A mother has been banned from a Florida elementary school after she complained about being asked to hide her breastfeeding on campus.

Maegan Shoemaker, 25, was stunned when the principal approached her as she sat in the bleachers at Plew Elementary School in Niceville during her niece's track practice on Wednesday.

She learned that another parent had complained about how she was breastfeeding her eight-month-old daughter Arya in view of the fifth-graders' athletics session.

But the married mother insisted that she had made sure the students couldn't see her by sitting behind a barrier.

Banned: Maegan Shoemaker, left with her husband Eric and right with her daughter Arya, has been banned from her niece's elementary school for getting angry when she was asked to hide her breastfeeding

'When [babies are] hungry, they're hungry,' Shoemaker told the Northwest Florida Daily News. 'I don't eat under a cover, and I don't expect my children to eat under a cover.'

But Principal Carolyn McAllister argued that  children could see her, proving a distraction.

When Shoemaker went to the office  to explain that it was her right to breastfeed there and that she had done nothing wrong, McAllister said she became 'belligerent'.

Shoemaker said: 'I wasn't backing down and I was standing my ground, but I wasn't violent.'

She left on foot with her baby daughter and a few minutes later, the school's resource officer and McAllister caught up with her in a patrol car.

They issued her a trespassing warning which bars her from entering school grounds for the rest of the school year.

Scene: Shoemaker, 25, was watching her niece's weekly track practice outside the Florida school, pictured, when a parent complained to staff and the principal told her to be more discreet

Shoemaker usually collects her niece from school every afternoon and attends her parent-teacher conferences and school activities, which she will now not be able to do. 

McAllister said that she never told the young mother that she couldn't breastfeed and only asked her to do it so the children couldn't see.

Shoemaker said she thinks this is more damaging to the children.

'Breasts are so... sexualized that they can't be used for their intended purpose,' she said. 'And that, to me, is wrong.'

Since the fallout, Shoemaker has been vocal on Facebook about her treatment and others have supported her by sharing images reading: 'Nursing in public - not a crime! I stand with Maegan.'
