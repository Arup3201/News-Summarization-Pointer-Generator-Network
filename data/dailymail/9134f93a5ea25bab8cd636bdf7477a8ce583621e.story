If only the second half of Premier League games counted, it would be Manchester City and not Chelsea sitting top of the table.

Sergio Aguero and Co are currently second in the division, six points behind Jose Mourinho's league leaders after three consecutive victories.

But Manuel Pellegrini's men have a superior record in the second half of games and would actually be two points clear of the Stamford Bridge outfit if only final 45 minutes mattered.

Premier League leaders Chelsea would still be top of the division if games finished after 45 minutes

The reigning champions have effectively earned 30 points in the second half of games this season - two more than rivals Chelsea, who have drawn seven of their 14 second periods.

The west London side would still be top of the league if games finished at half-time, although they would have some unfamiliar names attempting to chase them down.

Swansea, who are currently seventh, would be in second place on 24 points, while 11th placed Everton would be third on goal difference.

City would be down in fourth if only the first half of games counted, another indicator of their impressive second-half displays this term.

Newcastle are ninth in the Premier League and chasing a Champions League spot but Alan Pardew's men would be bottom of the table if matches were only 45 minutes long.

The Magpies have earned just nine points with their first half performances, leaving them below QPR and Burnley (both 12 points) in the relegation zone.

Manchester United currently occupy the fourth Champions League spot but Louis van Gaal's side would be fifth if games finished at half-time and sixth if only the second period counted.

Aston Villa shot up to 12th with victory at Crystal Palace earlier this week but Paul Lambert's men would be rock bottom if only the second-half mattered, having earned the equivalent of just eight points with some lacklustre displays after the break. 

It's the reverse for Arsenal, whose performances after Arsene Wenger's half-time team talks have led to an improvement in form.

The Gunners would be down in 13th if referees blew the full-time whistle after the first-half but fourth if only the second period counted towards their points total.
