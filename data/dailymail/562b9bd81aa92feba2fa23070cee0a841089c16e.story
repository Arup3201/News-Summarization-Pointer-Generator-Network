Court: Police officer Thomas Grant 'ruined' his career by researching a woman he fancied on the force's computers

A police officer illegally used a force computer to access details of a woman he fancied, but was caught out when he accidentally entered the details of the wrong person. 

Thomas Grant, a Sussex Police constable since 2008, was looking for police records on a woman he was sending text messages to.

But Brighton Magistrates’ Court heard today that the 24 -year-old had accessed the records of someone with a similar name - a witness to criminal damage.

Juliet Evans, prosecuting, said: 'He fancied her and thought he might have some luck in dating her.

'He was using the police computer for non-policing purposes.'

The Sussex Police constable searched the woman's records in the early hours of May 1 while he was on duty at Bognor Police Station.

He initially denied any wrongdoing but eventually admitted obtaining data without the consent of the data controller, an offence under the Data Protection Act 1988.

Miss Evans said the woman he researched did not know Grant - who has since resigned.

She said she was upset when she found out what he had been doing.

Kim Goodall, defending, said Grant's actions were 'stupid' and he had 'ruined' his career.

She added: 'He's ended his career in the police force. He knew he would be caught - he apologises.'

He was fined £800.

Speaking after the hearing Grant, of Bognor, West Sussex, said: 'I'm just glad that this is over.

'I just want to thank my friends, family and former colleagues for supporting me.'

Sussex Police Detective Sergeant Niall Moloney said: 'The misuse of force computers or systems by either officers or staff for anything other than a policing purpose is totally unacceptable and is not tolerated by Sussex Police.

'Any allegation of this kind is investigated thoroughly.

'Members of the public can be assured that their details are safe with us.

'Anyone who attempts to undermine that confidence will be dealt with swiftly and robustly.'
