Henri Lansbury will not sign a new contract at Nottingham Forest and is set to instead join Burnley in a deal worth around £3.5million as he looks to fulfil his ambition for Premier League football.

Forest owner Fawaz Al-Hasawi has challenged Lansbury, 23, to put pen to paper on a deal first offered in February but it is understood that the terms are significantly less than other team-mates and he has informed manager Stuart Pearce of his intention to leave.

Burnley boss Sean Dyche is keen on the midfielder, who has scored 12 goals in 53 starts since moving to the City Ground from Arsenal for £1m in 2012, and would offer regular game time.

It is believed to be another deal that initially progressed without Pearce’s full knowledge, after the sales of Jamaal Lascelles and Karl Darlow, with negotiations advancing between officials from Forest and Burnley until Lansbury told his manager about his desire to go last week.

Pearce has since reluctantly agreed to sanction the move if the right bid is made, rather than have an unhappy player in his squad, and there is still work to be done over a price. Forest are believed to be holding out for a fee nearer £5m.

Pearce and Al-Hasawi have been locked in a war of words after Lascelles and Darlow were sold to Newcastle United for a combined £7m before being loaned back for the season.

Pearce said the transfers were conducted without his knowledge, adding: ‘I am not prepared to fluff things when it comes to what was said and done behind the scenes. Two players were sold against my will. It disappointed me.’

Al Hasawi hit back and claimed the manager had been consulted, saying: ‘The manager and I openly discussed the proposed sale of Karl and Jamaal and he was aware of the negotiations throughout.

‘Sadly for me, there is no room for sentimentality in the running of a football club and it is up to me to start making some tough decisions to preserve the long-term sustainability of Nottingham Forest.’

Al Hasawi then discussed Lansbury, explaining: ‘Clearly he is a talented player who we don’t want to lose. He rejected my offer of a new contract earlier this year but that deal remains on the table.

‘He has two more years to run on his current contract and we hope he will play a huge part for us this season. It is now time for Henri to make his decision.’

Dispute: Fawaz Al Hasawi has hit back at Stuart Pearce's claims he was left in the dark at Nottingham Forest

Pearce has said publicly he does not want to lose Lansbury, a graduate of the Arsenal academy, and called him one of the Championship’s best players. But the former England Under-21 boss is aware of the pressures to meet financial fair play.

Pearce said: ‘I certainly hope we will not be losing any other players. The only ones I would want to move out is the ones I give the proviso to move out, who are not helpful to me.

‘If I get asked the question, I will give an honest answer over who should and shouldn't go. Hopefully, more often than not, the owners will take my guidance on that.

‘I wouldn't want Henri to go. I know there's been interest, but I would not want him to go. That is where I stand on him. I've had a long connection with him at international level and I want that to continue at club level.

‘He is one of the better players in the Championship, if not one of the best in the top echelons of the division overall. Can he play in the Premier League? Yes he can in my opinion.

‘There's been interest in Henri, but nothing anywhere near our valuation. We all turned it down – we are in unity on that one.’
