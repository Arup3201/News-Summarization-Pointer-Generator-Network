A highly rated pitching prospect for the Yankees is recovering after a 'vicious attack' against him last month, his agent said Thursday.

Ty Hensley's agent, Rob Martin, said in a statement to SBNation 'On behalf of Ty Hensley and his family, we are able to confirm that Ty was hospitalized after being brutally attacked and assaulted over the holidays in Oklahoma City.

'Ty was treated and released from the hospital and is presently recovering at home from the injuries he sustained after being knocked unconscious in this vicious attack. Ty and his family are grateful for all of the support, thoughts, and prayers he's received from friends, fans, and well-wishers. We respectfully request privacy during this difficult time.'

Hensley and the alleged attacker, Anthony Morales, had a verbal dispute over money teams give signing players, a probable cause affidavit said.

Morales faces a felony assault charge, ESPN reported. Hensley's attorney Jacob Diesselhorst told the news outlet that his client suffered numerous wounds. 

'Ty was hospitalized and is now home recovering,' Diesselhorst said. 'He has multiple injuries to his face, most notably a broken jaw in multiple places. 

'Luckily, he has no neurological injuries of any kind. He is pretty beaten up. He is doing well now and recovering. Besides his facial injuries, we expect him to make a full recovery.'

Diesselhorst told ESPN that Hensley and Morales had 'a friend-of-a-friend kind of deal.'

On December 28 - the night of the alleged assault - Hensley went to a friend's house in The Village, Oklahoma, after going to a bar with some buddies, a probable cause affidavit obtained by NJ Advance Media said. 

Morales was noticed at the bar while the group headed out and invited to come along by a male friend of Hensley, the document said.

A female witness told police she 'was in the laundry room [in the house when] she heard Mr. Hensley and the defendant  having an argument about the amount of money professional athletes are paid for signing with a professional team,'   the affidavit said.

The witness heard noises in the living room - and came out to find Morales fleeing on foot with Hensley passed out, the document said.

Hensley did not want to tell Morales about the money he received from the Yankees after being drafted in the first round, Diesselhorst told ESPN of his client's account.

Hensley spoke to police one day after the alleged assault and said 'his jaw was broken in two places, he was missing a tooth, his mouth was wired shut, his right eye was black, and he had stitches from a 2" laceration on his chin, and the right side of his head was swollen,' according to the probable cause affidavit.

Morales was a Weber State linebacker who the Carolina Panthers dropped earlier this year, ESPN reported.

Martin, Diesselhorst and the Yankees did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
