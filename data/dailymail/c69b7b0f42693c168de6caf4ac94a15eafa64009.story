Britain is planning to leave military equipment worth more than £2billion in Afghanistan when it withdraws from the war.

Around 40 per cent of hardware - including up to 1,200 protected trucks and personnel carriers - will be scrapped, sold or given away by the Ministry of Defence.

Military chiefs are preparing to bring home 6,500 containers of kit from the frontline. But some 4,500 loads will remain in the warzone.

Some equipment will be gifted to the Afghan National Army and Police so they can maintain security when the UK leaves in December 2014.

Other pieces of kit deemed surplus to requirement will be destroyed so it does not fall into the hands of insurgents.

But the planning assumptions, revealed by the MoD, have fuelled concern that sensitive equipment could inadvertently fall into the Taliban's clutches.

Dr John Louth, of the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) defence think-tank, said: 'What is benevolent today could be quite nasty tomorrow. The typical danger is that people who aren't your friend could somehow end up with it and use it.

'There could also be technical issues. There could be some very interesting technology in the kit that, if you thought about it, you wouldn't want a third party to get.'

David Livingstone, a security strategist at foreign affairs think-tank Chatham House, said: 'There will always be a risk that something with a UK Army serial number will get passed across [to the enemy].'

Shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy said: 'In an uncertain world it is essential that the UK retains much of the equipment deployed in Afghanistan.

'The UK's military needs must be the priority but we must consider how we can best support Afghan forces who have a long-term challenge to secure lasting peace.'

Defence chiefs have not disclosed the type or value of equipment it will bring home. The Mail, however, has been told the overall cost of kit left on the battlefield is expected to be at least £2billion.

The decision is likely to prove controversial as the Armed Forces are being forced to make drastic cuts to save money and tackle a £38billion black hole in the equipment budget.

The cost of transporting 'low-grade' equipment and supplies back to the UK will be up to £12,000 per 20ft-long container, say the MoD.

For vehicles and sensitive material it will rise to £30,000 per load.

Of the 1,900 protected vehicles being used by the Army in southern Afghanistan, the Mail understands only 700 vehicles have been listed for 'recovery'.

They are mainly the latest and most heavily armoured, such as Mastiffs, Ridgebacks and Foxhounds.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond insists that it bringing some equipment back to the UK will not be good 'value for money'.

Among the most prized vehicles that will be left behind are Wolfhound personnel carriers, some Jackals, a weapons-mounted armoured patrol vehicle, and a small number of heavily-protected Warthog all-terrain vehicles.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said: 'We will only bring back equipment that we need as part of our equipment plan.

'There will be a value for money case on each individual line of equipment

'Where equipment does not represent value for money, after taking into account the cost of getting it back from theatre and then refurbishing it into the core equipment plan, it will not be brought back; it will either be sold, gifted or destroyed.

'We will look at all the options for equipment that is not required.

'Is it useful to the Afghans? Is it sustainable by the Afghans? Can we afford to gift it to the Afghans? Is there a sale route for it? Is it something that we can sensibly attempt to sell? We will make a case-by-case judgment.'

An MoD spokesman said: 'Before gifting any equipment we must determine that the ANSF can sustain this equipment in terms of cost of ownership, support and enduring training.

'We want to ensure that our Afghan partner forces receive the equipment they need without duplication or unnecessary complexity.'
