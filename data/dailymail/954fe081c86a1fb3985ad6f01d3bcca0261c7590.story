This is the tiny bedroom castaway Jose Salvador Alvarenga will call home when he arrives back in El Salvador on Tuesday.

Alvarenga is used to cramped conditions, after apparently spending 13 months floating helplessly in a 24-foot boat in the Pacific Ocean.

He was given a brief taste of the high life in the luxury Marshall Islands Resort Hotel after he was found washed up on the remote atolls almost two weeks ago.

But he will be brought back to earth with a bump when he arrives back in the tiny village of Garita Palmera on the Pacific coast of El Salvador.

A humble but good life: This is the room and bed where castaway Jose Salvador Alvarenga will be living once he arrives home

Grateful: Ricardo Orellana, father and Maria Julia Alvarenga, mother of castaway Jose Salvador Alvarenga await for his return to El Salvador

Patience: Arely, wife of castaway Jose Salvador Alvarenga attends the family store. She awaits for his return to  the small costal town of Garita Palmera located in the western part of El Salvador

His mother Maria, father Ricardo, wife Arely Barrera and daughter, Fatima, 13, have prepared a ten by ten feet room just behind the family shop, which sells drinks and snacks.

The bedroom is only separated from the local store by shelves, stacked with goods.

At present it has a queen bed, covered in a turquoise sheet, a small bedside table and a single window, without any glass. There is also another bed in there for his younger sister.

It was his old room before he fled the country in 2001, following a brutal bar fight which almost cost him his life.

And today his mother insisted she will keep him out of harm's way in the future, even saying she will ban him from his fishing career and make him become a baker.

Maria told MailOnline: 'I never want him to go out on the sea again, never. I want him to do anything but fishing. He used to be a baker years ago, we've got a clay oven here, so he can do that again.'

Weak: Jose Salvador Alvarenga washed ashore late last month (left) in the Marshall Islands after spending more than a year drifting across the Pacific Ocean living on what he could catch. After hospital treatment, some proper food and a shave (right), he will return home on Tuesday

Never again: The castaway's father added: 'He can do farming or something agricultural; we just don't want him to be a fisherman again'

Going home: People see off Jose Salvador Alvarenga, the Salvadoran man who says he drifted in an open boat across the Pacific for more than a year, as he is flying home at an airport in Majuro, Marshall Islands on Monday

Return: Jose Salvador Alvarenga (right) of El Salvador shakes hands with Marshall Islands President Christopher Loeak prior to his departure at the airport in Majuro on Monday

Ricardo added: 'He can do farming or something agricultural; we just don't want him to be a fisherman again.'

Maria added: 'We don't have much, but he will be home. We may only be able to feed him rice, beans and tortilla, but he will live humbly and he will live well'.

Alvarenga, 37, set off on his long journey home at around 3am Eastern Standard Time, flying from The Marshall Islands to Honolulu.

The nervous flyer was given a window seat in the economy section and enjoyed a meal of lasagne and vegetables.

That was followed by fruit salad, cookies from the island nation of Guam, and accompanied by a soft drink and water.

After four-and-a-half hours in the air he landed in Hawaii and got to spend a few hours in the airport's VIP lounge.

Then he boarded a United Airlines flight to Houston, Texas. On arrival in the United States he will make the final leg of his journey, a three hour flight to San Salvador, the capital of his homeland.

From there he will be driven for two hours along a winding coastal road to the tiny village of Garita Palmera, where his family will be waiting to finally welcome him home.

Greetings: Fatima Maeba Alvarenga, 13-year-old daughter of Alvarenga, prepare to receive her father at her house  in Garita Palmera, 118 km west of San Salvador

Ready: Alvarenga's family members  prepare to receive him in Garita Palmera on Tuesday

It is believed one of his six US based brothers and sisters will travel with him from Houston, but his family in El Salvador are still in the dark as to exactly when he will return.

Ricardo said: 'We honestly do not know when he will be back, we have very little information.

'The one thing we have been told is that he might be taken straight to a hospital to be checked out, because he is still unwell.'

The fisherman's remarkable story hit the headlines after he washed ashore late last month.

He claims he set off on a shark fishing trip from the Chiapas region of Mexico, but after winds blew him off course, he spent the next 14-months drifting across the ocean living on what he could catch.

Having told doctors that he had kept himself alive by eating raw fish, the flesh of sea birds and turtles and drinking their blood and his own urine, there was concern about his kidneys and liver.

While he looked in remarkably good health and overall condition when seen on the atoll of Ebon after coming ashore for the first time since he had set out on an ill-fated fishing expedition, his health deteriorated when he was brought to Majuro in the Marshall Islands.

Such was the concern of doctors that a day after he was released from hospital and taken to a lagoon-side hotel to relax he was returned to hospital and placed on a rehydration drip.

Preparations: The family gets ready for a reunion

Then he was taken back to the hotel as arrangements were made to fly him home to his family.

A police guard was placed outside his room to prevent journalists talking to him and every step was taken to ensure that details of his return journey did not leak out.

An El Salvadorian diplomat who flew from Japan brought with him a special passport-making kit, allowing him to prepare an emergency passport for Alvarenga so he could pass through US airports on the way home.

He also needed the document to enter his country of birth.
