A new leaked email written to Sony studio Michael Lynton head shows one producer saying that Denzel Washington does not do well for the company because he is black.

In the exchange, written about the Oscar winning star's recent role in the film The Equalizer, the producer says that Washington does not do well at the worldwide box office because of the color of his skin.

The producer then blames this on the racism of non-American audiences.

Harsh statement: A producer said to Sony head Michael Lynton (left) that Denzel Washington (with Amy Pascal and Matt Tolmach) doesn't make money at the worldwide box office because he is black

Makes no sense: The email was about his film The Equalizer, costarring Chloe Moretz (center) and directed by Antoine Fuqua (right), which made half its money overseas

In the email, obtained by Radar Online, the producer 'suggested Sony should avoid casting black actors to appeal to an international market that the producer deemed racist.' 

Writes the producer of Washington, 'Casting him is saying we’re ok with a double if the picture works.'

A double as opposed to a homerun.

They then add; 'He’s reliable at the domestic [box office], safe, but has not had a huge success in years. I believe whenever possible the non event pictures, extra ‘bets’ should have a large inherent upside and be made for the right price. Here there isn’t a large inherent upside.'

This despite the fact that Washington is not only one of the greatest actors of his generation, but also one of the biggest and most consistent box office stars.

Perhaps most shocking though is that this email was written about The Equalizer after the film did incredibly well overseas.

As Radar reports, 'Washington’s The Equalizer grossed $191 million at theaters worldwide, with 47% of the ticket sales coming from outside of the United States.

The producer then writes, 'I believe that the international motion picture audience is racist — in general pictures with an African American lead don’t play well overseas.'

It is unknown who the producer is, and Washington and Lynton have yet to comment on this latest leak.

This as the group behind the hack, Guardians of Peace, have been successful in their goal of shutting down Sony's film The Interview, a comedy about the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.

Sony Pictures Entertainment pulled the planned Christmas Day release of the picture after the hackers threatened 9/11-like terror attacks on cinemas showing the comedy.

What's more, the film may never be released at all.

'Sony Pictures has no further release plans for the film,' said a spokesperson for the studio Wednesday evening.

This despite the fact that the film cost $42million to make and tens of millions to market.

Almost immediately, many in Hollywood voiced their concern, with writer Aaron Sorkin saying how upset he was that 'the U.S. succumbed to an unprecedented attack on our most cherished, bedrock principle of free speech by a group of North Korean terrorists,' and director Judd Apatow explaining the many problems this means for films moving forward.

Federal government officials have said that North Korea is behind the hack, as has been assumed for the past two weeks, though they are not expected to formally announce this until later this week.

Authorities are also looking into whether or not someone inside Sony helped the hackers.
