A schizophrenic Queens man who last year pleaded guilty to stalking Anderson Cooper told a Manhattan judge yesterday the CNN anchor's partner has been terrorizing him via the internet.

Alex Hausner, 40, told Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Charles Solomon that Cooper's longtime boyfriend,  Benjamin Maisani, has threatened his life online and that he feels 'in danger'.

The psychiatric patient said that 'acquaintances' and 'surrogates' of the nightclub owner 'have possibly contributed to this' and that 'they use their cellphones to follow me around'.

Alex Hausner told a Manhattan judge that Anderson Cooper's longtime boyfriend, Benjamin Maisani, has been threatening his life online

Hausner said that Maisani (left) has put his life 'in danger' but he will 'always have feelings' for CNN host Cooper (right)

If Hausner avoids having any contact with Cooper (right) and Maisani (left) he'll avoid jail and be sentenced to five years of probation

While addressing the court, Hausner rambled about Maisani and his connection to 'scumbag society', according to the New York Daily News. 

'I am under the impression that some of the people, various people from various places, might actually be some sort of surrogate for Mr Maisani.

'Again there are many different facets of scumbag society.'

Hausner pleaded guilty to felony menacing and harassment charges last April and received no jail time as part of the deal.

On Tuesday, he confirmed he was complying with   psychiatric treatment the court ordered him to undergo after stalking Cooper, 47.

That was the judge's primary focus during the hearing and he said Hausner's claims against Maisani, were 'problems to deal with separately'.

'My concern is staying away, which you say you have, from Mr Cooper and his partner. These are the conditions of your plea and you've got to conform,' Judge Solomon said, the New York Post reported.

Despite this, Hausner said as he left court: 'I will always have feelings for Anderson.'

Hausner first became obsessed with Cooper when the CNN star passed the confessed stalker in Union Square and allegedly whispered to him, 'You’re hot.'

The Union Square meeting began a string of unwelcome visits and phone calls to Cooper from 2007 to 2013, including an incident where Hausner allegedly kicked in the front door of the converted firehouse  Maisani and the CNN star share.

As part of his plea deal, Hausner is not allowed to have any contact with Cooper or Maisani. 

If he is able to hold up that end of the bargain and continues to attend treatment, Hausner will be sentenced to five years of probation and stay out of jail.
