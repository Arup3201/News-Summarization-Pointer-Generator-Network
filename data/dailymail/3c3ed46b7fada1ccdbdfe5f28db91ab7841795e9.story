Ever wonder what would happen if a garbage truck got converted into a mobile home? Well, the engineers at Germany heavy vehicle maker UNICAT have, creating a line of unusual-looking recreational vehicles that are definitely worlds away from a Winnebago.

UNICAT's Terracross line, with six models to choose from 'are available to accommodate your personal ideas about travel,' according to the company's website.

The model displayed in the photos is the EX-63HD/MAN TGA 6x6 , which UNICAT describes as a 'machine [that] combines the rugged "go anywhere" off-road capabilities of the MAN 6x6 with the comforts of living at home. Safe 2 years of design, construction and testing. Built to the exacting standards of the world-class UNICAT engineering team, this "Home on Wheels" is virtually unused and is ready for your immediate occupancy.'

When it's time to eat, an area next to the kitchen in the UNICAT RV is used as a cozy dining area

The vehicles have what you would expect in an RV: a kitchen, bathroom, living area, and even a small area with a desk and chair.

'Technical demands have been taken in consideration as well as practical demands: seating/eating, sleeping, kitchen, shower, storage, water supply, heating, lights, electricty, weight distribution, center of gravity, stability, reliabilityâ€”all aspects are well balanced,' UNICAT says.

The company adds you can customize the interior as well.

Unfortunately, the company doesn't publicly disclose how much such mobile luxury will cost you.
