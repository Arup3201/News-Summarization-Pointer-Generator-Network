Seven in 10 households went without heating at some point this winter to save money, a study claims.

More than a third of people surveyed this month also said cutting back on energy usage is affecting their quality of life or health - up from one in six when similar research was carried out a year ago.

The findings come after a string of price hikes from energy giants kicked in as temperatures fell. Eight in 10 consumers said that they believe household energy in the UK has become ‘unaffordable’.

Around one in six people surveyed by uSwitch said they regularly went without heating this winter to keep costs down, while one in 50 said they always did this and half said they did so occasionally.

The website’s consumer policy director Ann Robinson said: ‘When it comes to household energy, Britain has run slap bang into an affordability crisis - as a result, people are going cold.

‘The cost of energy is now so high that households are going without heating in the depths of winter for fear of running up a large bill.’

Earlier this month, E.ON was the last of the big six energy giants to increase its tariffs, following a string of similar confirmations from SSE, British Gas, npower, Scottish Power and EDF.

Another comparison website, MoneySupermarket, recently said households typically use around 40 per cent of their annual energy consumption during the winter months, making the next average quarterly standard bill likely to be well over £500.

The findings were published days after the Government's flagship Green Deal was launched, offering households long-term loans to help them make their homes more energy efficient and cut bills.

Some campaigners have said the said that the scheme does not go far enough and will not stop people sinking into fuel poverty.

A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: ‘The Coalition Government is absolutely committed to tackling fuel poverty and has a range of initiatives in place to help vulnerable households struggling with rising energy bills.

‘Two million households will get help under the Warm Home Discount Scheme this year, including more than one million low income pensioners who will receive £130 off their bill.

‘The Green Deal will help millions improve their homes so they are better insulated, with extra help for those who need it most.

‘Winter Fuel Payments and Cold Weather Payments are also available to help vulnerable households and we are legislating through the Energy Bill to simplify tariffs and make sure consumers are able to get the best deal.’

More than 2,000 people took part in the uSwitch survey this month.
