Former Labour minister Denis MacShane was formally accused of fiddling his parliamentary expenses yesterday.

The former Europe Minister will be charged with false accounting when he appears before magistrates later this month.

Prosecutors said there was enough evidence to bring a case against the 65-year-old over suspicious claims worth £12,900.

Former Labour MP Denis MacShane is to be charged with false accounting over parliamentary expenses claims

They accuse the former outspoken MP of fraudulently charging taxpayers for research and translation services.

The decision is a U-turn by prosecutors and police, who previously ruled
there was not enough evidence to put MacShane before a court.

Malcolm McHaffie, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: ‘This charge 
relates to fraudulent claims with a total value of £12,900. The charge 
is of false accounting, contrary to the Theft Act 1968.

MacShane (pictured, left, in 2004, during his time as Minister for Europe) stood down as MP for Rotherham last year

‘It is alleged that Denis MacShane claimed expenses for research and 
translation services carried out by a company that did not carry out 
that work. Denis MacShane now stands charged with a criminal offence and
has the right to a fair trial.’

In a statement, MacShane said: ‘I am disappointed at the CPS decision 
but as the matter is now in the hands of the court, I will be making no 
further statement.’

He will appear at City of Westminster magistrates’ court on July 30.

Denis MacShane was born in Glasgow in 1948 and was educated at the independent St Benedict's School, in Ealing, before reading history at Merton College, Oxford.

He worked for the BBC from 1969 to 1977.

He was policy director of the International Metal Workers' Federation from 1980 to 1992.

He served as an MP for Rotherham from 1994 until his resignation last year.

During this time he served under the Labour Government, including a period as Minister for Europe from 2002 until 2005.
