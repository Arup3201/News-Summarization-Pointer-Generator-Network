Sentenced: Orlando Lopez, 24, will spend life behind bars even though he maintains his innocence

Even the judge who sentenced the murderer to spend 311 years behind bars couldn't help but inject her own personal condemnation at the sentencing hearing.

Judge Doris Shockley said that the even though she has worked in the Lakeport, California area for 'a very long time' she found Orlando Lopez's shooting spree that left one child dead and five others injured to be 'the most callous and vicious and nonsensical' crimes of her career.

The shooting took place at a family barbeque in 2011, when he and a friend opened fire inside a home as the result of a feud between two families.

Authorities say he and 22-year-old Paul Braden fired shotguns from a neighbor's yard at people attending the barbecue.

Victim: Skyler Rapp, 4, was the young boy who was shot dead in the June 2011 incident and his mother and her boyfriend were among the wounded

Lopez, 24, was convicted of first-degree murder and other charges in the June 2011 shooting in Clearlake.  Four-year-old Skyler Rapp died.

The boy's mother, Desiree Kirby, was one of the wounded, as was her boyfriend Ross Sparks, his brother Andrew Sparks, and two others.

The boy’s grandmother spoke at the sentencing, saying that her grandson was ‘very much loved’ and had just finished preschool and looking forward to kindergarten at the time of the shooting.

Co-conspirator: Paul Braden, 22, is also charged in the same case

She warned that Lopez was ‘about to find out what hell is’.

Lopez was found guilty of first degree murder, five counts of attempted murder, six counts of assault with a firearm, two counts of mayhem, and a number of other charges relating to the use of a firearm inside a home.

He is now due to spend 311 consecutive years in prison.

The judge said that the shooting at the barbeque was the most violent in a continued escalation of criminal activity by Lopez, who has a history of substance abuse, but she did not detail the specific crimes.

Throughout the trial and sentencing, Lopez maintained his innocence and claimed that his trial was flawed because he was tried in conjunction with Braden. Lopez says that while he was sorry for what happened at that fatal barbeque, he is now being taken away from his own children, ages 4, 6, and 8 years old.

'I now have lost my family, including three children, due to an unjust court system,' his lawyer read in a statement on Tuesday.

Judge Shockley called the shooting 'callous' and 'nonsensical', and Lake County News reports that she left Lopez with the chilling warning that state prison 'is a very difficult place'.
