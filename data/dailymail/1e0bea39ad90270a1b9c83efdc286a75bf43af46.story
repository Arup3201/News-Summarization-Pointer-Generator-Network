A thug who bit off a man’s tongue mocked his victim outside court after he was spared jail by a judge.David Greaves, 50, pumped his fist and shouted ‘tongue’s twisted!’ as he celebrated avoiding custody for the  sickening assault.

The window cleaner has a string of previous convictions for violence and was expected to be locked up for attacking father-of-two John Dufton.

But Judge Gillian Matthews instead handed down a suspended sentence because she ‘trusted’ him to stop his violent behaviour.

Arrogant David Greaves laughed and stuck his tongue out as he walked away from court after admitting biting off another man's tongue

The same judge sparked controversy 
last year when she refused to jail a convicted paedophile who claimed a 
child made sexual advances towards him.

Yesterday,
victim Mr Dufton, 33, was ‘furious’ with the leniency of the sentence 
and is demanding a review by the Attorney General.

The
water engineer is now missing a one inch chunk of his tongue, leaving 
him with a permanent speech impediment which he said ‘scares and 
confuses’ his children.

The court heard how Greaves (right) started the trouble inside The Falcon in Chester-le-Street by head-butting and punching Mr Dufton (left)

A 
family friend said: ‘This man has done this sort of thing before on a 
number of occasions. A suspended prison sentence for biting off 
someone’s tongue just doesn’t make sense.’

Teesside
Crown Court heard how Greaves started the trouble inside a pub in 
Chester-le-Street on May 25 by head-butting and punching Mr Dufton. As 
the fight spilled outside, Greaves tried to gouge his victim’s eyes with
his thumbs.

Prosecutor
Peter Sabiston said: ‘He pulled his head down, inserted his tongue, 
shook his head and somehow managed to latch on to Mr Dufton’s tongue.

He was horrified as the defendant then bit him.’ Despite his injuries, Mr Dufton chased his attacker and gave him a ‘comprehensive beating’ before going to hospital.

Surgeons were unable to re-attach the missing part of the tongue, which had been taken to hospital in ice.

He
said: ‘The pain was unbearable, I was in agony, the worst pain I have 
ever known in my life. The fact that he celebrated like he did outside 
court, sticking his tongue out, just shows what kind of man he is.’

Greaves, who has convictions for violence going back to 1997, said he had no memory of the biting.He admitted causing grievous bodily harm, which carries a maximum sentence of five years.

Judge
Matthews called it a ‘truly horrific’ attack, adding: ‘How he behaved 
to you in advance did not justify your disgraceful conduct, which must 
have been a truly horrendous thing.’

However,
she said she was ‘trusting’ Greaves, of Pelton, County Durham, to stop 
his violent behaviour and handed down a two-year suspended jail term.

She
also ordered him to pay £2,000 in compensation and imposed a two-year 
restraining order. Last year, Judge Matthews outraged children’s 
charities after freeing paedophile John Thompson, who accused his 
seven-year-old victim of ‘coming on to him’.

In
2011, the judge told serial criminal James Wanley he could do jail 
‘standing on his head’ and needed ‘a tougher punishment’ – so she gave 
him a suspended sentence.
