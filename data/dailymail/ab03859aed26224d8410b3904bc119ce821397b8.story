Ross Hadley is the envy of all his friends after being put in charge of fitness for the Miss World contest.

Ross, 35, from London has been given the task of measuring just how fit all 126 Miss World contestants really are.

The father-of-two only landed his job as director of leisure at the Marriott County Hall in Westminster, London, eight months ago, but now his place of work is home to the entire Miss World cortege ahead of the pageant on December 14.

He said: ‘I’d love to use the line, it’s a tough job, but somebody has to do it, but I’d be lying as it probably is the best job in the world.

‘I’ve been a fitness trainer since 1999 and never realised when I started out that my diploma in fitness training and sports therapy would lead to anything like this.

‘The contestants are all stunning and very glamorous, but they range in fitness from fairly unfit to spectacularly fit.

‘I had to supervise the tests and mark them and a few girls literally collapsed with exhaustion afterwards.

‘You could tell some of the girls have never exercised. Some didn’t know how to use the rowing machine.

‘We were pushing it to the max with their fitness assessment and some were not really ready for that.'

Ross continued: ‘The fittest of them all was 22-year-old Miss South Africa, who is called Rolene Strauss – she got full marks in every discipline and scored 20. She was absolutely stunning with dark hair and trained very hard.

‘Miss England Carina scored 16 and the other home nations girls were all pretty fit as well.

‘They all had to do four different fitness tests in a period of 10 to 11 minutes.

‘We started with the 500 metre row in the quickest time, then full body weight squats and then as many press ups as they could manage in a minute.

‘We ended with full burpees that are a mix of press-up, squats and pulling yourself up and it was as many of those in a minute as possible.’

Unsurprisingly, Ross's friends from five-a-side football and former workmates have all been asking if he needs any help with the job while the contestants are in town. 

He said: ‘I was quite surprised at the level of interest it attracted with people contacting me out of the blue asking if I needed a hand – as well as my mates from five-a-side I’ve had my uncles asking questions.

‘I was quite surprised by some of their performances and a few had booked personal trainers ahead of this, so were taking it very seriously.'

Ross might be surrounded by beauty pageant contestants every day at work, but the trainer is adamant that he really only has eyes for his wife Jamie, 28, and their daughters – Molly, six, and Bella, three. He said: 'I know my wife understands it’s all part of the job.’

He continued: 'Others had no idea how to use a rowing machine, so had clearly never seen the inside of a gym.

‘All the guys will have their own view on who is the fittest – but my job is to assess who is truly fit and there was a stand out winner on that front.’
