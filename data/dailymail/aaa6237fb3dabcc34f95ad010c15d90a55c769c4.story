A Texas Air Force basic training instructor has been sentenced to 30 days of confinement and reduction in rank for his part in a sex scandal at one of the busiest military training centers in America.

Technical Sergeant Christopher Smith wooed one female trainee and fraternized with another at the Lackland Air Force base in San Antonio which has become the centre of an ongoing sex scandal.

Investigators say at least 38 female trainees were victimized with 15 instructors implicated and six of those already charged.

Busy: Lackland is where every American airman receives basic training and has about 475 instructors for the approximately 35,000 airmen who graduate every year

A seven-member military jury deliberated for five hours after a three-day court martial at the base before finding Tech. Sgt guilty of sexual misconduct.

He was sentenced to 30 days confinement and reduction in rank to airman first class.

Lackland is where all American Air Force 
recruits go through basic training. It has about 500 instructors for 
about 35,000 airmen who graduate every year. While one in five recruits 
are women, most instructors are men.

Last month, a military jury gave Staff Sgt. Luis Walker a 20-year sentence after the former instructor was convicted of rape and sexual assault. The counts against Walker were the most severe in the investigation.

Prosecutors say he used his position as a military trainer at Lackland Air Force base in San Antonio to gain female recruits' trust, and then he made illicit sexual advances.

Walker's court-martial included testimony from 10 women, one of whom wept as she described him luring her into his base office and sexually assaulting her on a bed, ignoring her pleas to stop.

Prosecutors say Walker sexually assaulted or had improper sexual or personal contact with at least 10 female recruits from October 2010 through January 2011.

The sexual misconduct at the base apparently began in 2009, but the first woman didn't come forward until last year. The first allegations were levied against Walker.

Six of the 15 instructors being investigated have been charged, with Walker and another instructor, Staff Sgt. Peter Vega-Maldonado, already having been court-martialed.

Vega-Maldonado admitted in June to having sex with a female trainee and he was given 90 days of confinement as part of a plea deal.

Courts-martial have been set for three more trainers, with Master Sgt. Jamey Crawford scheduled for trial in early September.

He stands accused of having a wrongful sexual relationship with a trainee, wrongfully providing and consuming alcohol with a trainee and committing adultery with the trainee.

The Air Force has permanently removed Walker and 35 other instructors for a variety of reasons that include misconduct, failure to meet standards and medical issues.

A two-star general, Major General Margaret H. Woodward, has launched a separate, independent probe. Nearly 80 members of Congress have called for a hearing.

Meanwhile, a Republican senator had blocked a vote on the White House pick for Air Force chief of staff over the service's response to the scandal.

In a statement last week, Senator John Cornyn of Texas said he put a hold on the nomination of General Mark Welsh 'until I feel the Air Force is adequately addressing the unacceptable situation at Lackland and taking corrective steps to reform their training program to prevent this from happening again'.

However, Cornyn rescinded the hold yesterday after meeting with Welsh to discuss the Lackland scandal. Welsh succeeds General Norton Schwartz as head of the Air Force.
