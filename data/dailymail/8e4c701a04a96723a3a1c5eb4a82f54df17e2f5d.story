Dave Lee Travis said his ‘nightmare is continuing’ yesterday after being told he will face a new allegation of indecent assault.

The former Radio 1 star was cleared last month of carrying out 12 sex attacks involving young women, at the end of a high-profile six-week trial.

The Crown Prosecution Service then announced Travis would be retried over two allegations on which the jury had failed to agree.

Dave Lee Travis is to be charged with a further count of indecent assault, Southwark Crown Court has heard

Former Radio 1 DJ Dave Lee Travis, pictured with his wife Marianne Griffin, arrives at Southwark Crown Court in February when it was announced he would face a retrial on charges of indecent assault and sexual assault

The first concerns an alleged assault on a stage hand when the DJ was appearing in Aladdin in Crawley, West Sussex, in 1990.

The second relates to an alleged attack on a journalist interviewing him in his home in November 2008.

Yesterday
 the 68-year-old DJ wiped away tears in court after being told the new 
charge will be added. He is expected to face a fresh trial later this 
year.

Outside Southwark 
Crown Court, Travis – real name David Griffin – said: ‘It has been a bit
 of a nightmare. The only thing I want to say is that the nightmare is 
continuing.’

The new charge relates to an alleged assault on a young woman when Travis appeared on The Mrs Merton Show on the BBC in 1995.

It
 was also revealed that a further two women have come forward over the 
past three months with fresh claims against the former Top Of The Pops 
presenter.

One allegation 
will be heard as evidence in any forthcoming trial, rather than being 
added as a separate criminal charge, because the alleged offence took 
place outside British jurisdiction. The other allegation has been 
dropped.

Travis was arrested
 in 2012 by police officers from Operation Yewtree, the investigation 
into historic sex crimes sparked by the death of Jimmy Savile. The 
investigation has already cost £2.7million, of which £490,000 has been 
paid to the 30-strong detective team.

The
 DJ’s original six-week trial is estimated to have cost around £300,000,
 while the second trial may cost another £150,000. Travis had to sell 
his £1million house in Mentmore, Buckinghamshire, to pay for his legal 
fees for the first trial.

He
 appeared in court yesterday wearing a suit, black coat and a red scarf,
 and accompanied by Marianne his Swedish-born wife of 40 years.

He
 held his head in his hands, took his glasses off and wiped his eyes as 
prosecutor Miranda Moore QC announced the decision to bring a new charge
 against him.

‘Mr Griffin 
will be charged on a further offence of indecent assault relating to a 
young woman,’ she said. ‘He can either go with the officers to the 
police station this afternoon or he can be summonsed.’

The
 charge comes in wake of a series of blows for the £2.7million Operation
 Yewtree - the police investigation into a series of sexual abuse claims
 against the late Jimmy Savile and other high profile individuals, 
including Travis.

Earlier this week, charges against comedian Jimmy Tarbuck were dropped.

Similarly,
 Jim Davidson was arrested on January 2 last year on suspicion of sexual
 offences. The 60-year-old Big Brother winner was later told he would 
not face further action.

As he left court, Travis said he wanted to draw attention to the fact that today was the 50th birthday of Radio Caroline - the offshore radio station where he started his career.

He went on: 'I’d like to take the opportunity to wish all my colleagues in the radio and the music business a happy day, and spend some time remembering what it used to be like in the music business when it was actually quite enjoyable.'

Travis was previously accused of indecently assaulting 10 women and sexually assaulting another in alleged incidents - which dated back to 1976 when he was at the height of his fame.

The jury of eight women and four men deliberated for more than 20 hours before finding him not guilty of 12 indecent assault charges.

But they were not able to agree on a charge of alleged indecent assault against a woman in the early 1990s along with an alleged sexual assault in 2008.
