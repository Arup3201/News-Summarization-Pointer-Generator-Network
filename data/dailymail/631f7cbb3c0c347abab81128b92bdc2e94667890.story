'I wanted to change the play but I did not see the pass, so I kept the ball,' Pogba told RMC. 'Then I slipped and lost the ball.

'Pat did not come over to scold me. He came to encourage me. There was no argument.

'As I often say, this is my 'Uncle Pat' and he came to tell me it was not serious and that I should continue as I was doing, as he always done in the past.

'I was a little bummed about losing the ball, but football is like that.'

Pogba and Evra, who left Manchester United to join Juventus at the end of last season, are in contention to start Les Bleus' friendly match against Armenia on Tuesday.
