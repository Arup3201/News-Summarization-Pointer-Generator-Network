This is the spectacular moment that scores of hot air balloons lifted off the ground at a massive festival in central Mexico.

Crowds of over 400,000 gathered to watch as nearly 200 balloons took to the sky over the city of Leon on Saturday.

They included a variety of colours and recognisable shapes such as Mickey Mouse, SpongeBob SquarePants and a killer whale.

But the most appropriate was possibly a balloon shaped like an alarm clock as most spectators arrived early to ensure they had a prime position to watch the 13th International Balloon Festival of Leon.

One of the balloons had a close call at one point as its basket briefly dipped into a lake. 

Attended by hot air balloon pilots from over 15 countries, the International Balloon Festival is currently the biggest of its kind in Latin America.

The festival, founded in 2002, began with only 27 balloons.

It provides a major boost for local businesses in Leon and event organisers claim that hotels in the region were at full occupancy over the weekend.

'This is a big event, a massive event,' said Leon Tourism Secretary Manuel Lopez.

'This year we are expecting 430,000 visitors, with an economic gain of some 500 million pesos (approximately £23,575 or $36,887).'

The first manned hot air balloon flight occurred in 1783, reaching an altitude of 3,280ft (one kilometre).

Almost 50 years later in 1842, Don Benito Leon Acosta and Rubi de Celis, born in nearby Guanajuato City, took to the skies in a hot air balloon - the first time an aircraft ever flew over Mexico.
