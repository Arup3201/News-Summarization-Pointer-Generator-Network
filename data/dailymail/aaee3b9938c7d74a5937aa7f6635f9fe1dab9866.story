What is it about Michael Gove that makes him attract controversy like a ripe peach attracts wasps?

After that bruising bout of infighting with Theresa May over the threat of Islamic extremism, most ministers would have thought it wise to keep their head down.

How Mrs May must be enjoying the sight of her adversary becoming embroiled in another unnecessary and bloody fight – this time involving the Prime Minister.

Many Tory MPs think it is inconceivable that the Education Secretary did not know Dominic Cummings was giving a poisonous interview to the same newspaper that two weeks ago reported his own withering criticism of the Home Secretary – and that Gove himself once worked for.

Gove’s staff insist the first he knew was when a copy of the early edition was emailed to him on Sunday evening.

Despite such denials, Gove’s enemies – and some of his admirers – suspect he was in cahoots with Cummings and will not be displeased by the political fallout, even though it is damaging the Tory Party.

One backbench MP said: ‘I suspect this is Gove’s way of making public his concerns that his civil servants are against him and that he is not being supported by officials in No10.’

As an attack dog who was fiercely loyal to Gove when they worked together, Cummings is now widely seen to be continuing to voice what Gove can’t be seen to say himself. If this is the case, it’s a very dangerous path for Gove to tread.

What’s more, the vitriol continues to flow, with Cummings following his newspaper interview in which he accused the Prime Minister of governing by chasing headlines, by publishing a blog against the PM’s policy on the EU. It read: ‘Our approach to the EU – whining, rude, dishonest, unpleasant, childishly belligerent in public while pathetically craven in private, and overall hollow – fits the pattern.’

The behaviour of ‘officials in No10’ over Iraq came in for criticism, too.

The two aides he pointed the finger at are Ed Llewellyn, the PM’s Old Etonian chief of staff, and Craig Oliver, Cameron’s communications chief. He had already told the Times he thought both men were ‘far out of their depth’.

The problem for the Tory party is that Cummings’ views are shared by many backbench MPs who agree with his assessment of Cameron’s No10 team.

Downing Street concedes Gove cannot – or will not – control Cummings, who quit as his special adviser in January.

One senior Tory said: ‘Gove would rather he did not have these periodic eruptions. They do not help. But Cummings is on a crusade to improve the way the Government runs things. Above all, he is enraged that the Civil Service is blocking Gove’s education reforms and hopes by speaking out he will shame No10 into giving Gove the support he needs.

‘Of course, Cummings once had his uses to No10. After he left his job with Gove, he described Nick Clegg as ‘self-obsessed, dishonest’ and a ‘revolting character’.

While Gove would never use such language, his former aide was merely reflecting his – and many other senior Tories’ – deep dislike of Clegg.

Indeed, it is his loathing of the Lib Dems that lies behind Cummings’ attack on Llewellyn and Oliver.He was furious that they never stood up against Lib Dem posturing which he felt was sabotaging Gove’s radical reforms.

Cummings has trenchant views on how generations of children have been failed by Britain’s school system. His mother was a special needs teacher.

After running a failing airline firm in Russia, he embarked on a political career and had an unhappy stint as director of strategy during Iain Duncan Smith’s ill-starred tenure as Tory leader.

Tory Party historian Tim Bale said the then 30-year-old Cummings ‘got up the noses of traditionalists’ as he bemoaned the fact that the ‘modernising project was doomed to a series of half-measures and superficial initiatives.’

After Gove became shadow education secretary in 2007, he made Cummings his chief of staff. Immediately, Cummings locked horns with Andy Coulson, the then Tory communications chief, who did not like free-thinkers.

When Cameron entered Downing Street, it was no surprise that Coulson blocked Cummings becoming an adviser to Gove. Yet when Coulson was forced to resign, Cummings was back.

They may no longer be working together, but the pair share the same outlook and passion. Eccentric to the point of being slightly mad and with a shambolic dress sense, Cummings makes abstruse references from classical literature.

Unlike most ministerial special advisers, he has no ambition for a career in frontline politics. With such an operator by his side, Michael Gove had a very powerful ally. But now he’s no longer a paid employee, Cummings is out of control.

Naively, Cummings believes his latest intervention will persuade Cameron to give Gove more support.But he risks driving a wedge between them. Then, not only would Michael Gove find himself marginalised, but he might easily lose his job in a reshuffle.
