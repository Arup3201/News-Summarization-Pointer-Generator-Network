Television insiders are speculating that Katie Couric's daytime talk show 'Katie' won't make it to a third season and that the host could move to CNN.

'Katie' launched in September 2012 and was syndicated to stations in more than 95 per cent of the country, but a recent Nielsen Media Research report showed that in Mid-may, the show's ratings were down 30 per cent from the same period last year.

As first reported by Mail Online, the show was renewed for a second season in January with executive producer Rachel Miskowiec on board.

Veteran: Before her own eponymous show, Katie Couric was a co-host on the hugely popular Today Show, and a respected news anchor for CBS

Couric, a TV veteran of the 'Today Show'
and a respected news anchor, launched the show with executive producer 
Jeff Zucker, who quickly decamped for CNN to become the company's 
worldwide president.

Since Zucker's departure, reports of a lack of leadership and direction have surfaced, especially after his replacement, Michael Morrison, announced he too would be leaving the series after the first season wraps in July.

A staff member told the New York Post, 'Jeff’s departure left a void... Then they had four co-executive producers and the staffing decisions being made were poor. Katie was left vulnerable.'

Another insider said, 'There wasn’t a 
figure who could keep control. It became challenging because of the way 
that Jeff left. There’s been creative tension.'

Morrison will be replaced by a former 'The Tyra Banks Show' producer, Rachel Miskowiec as executive producer,
but it's unclear whether she'll be able to undo the damage already 
done.

Meanwhile, buzz inside ABC has been that Couric could leave the show after the second season and head to CNN to join Zucker.

'The show was oversold at syndication 
and hasn’t lived up to expectations,' one source told the New York Post.

'Now everyone at ABC is gossiping that Katie will end up at CNN with 
Jeff.'

It's not just insiders speculating about the show. Critics, too, have perceived the lack of direction.

'The program has had trouble finding a hook,' wrote Laure Bennett for New Republic.

'On ‘Katie,’ Couric has seemed at times like a peppy lifestyle reporter and at times like a de-fanged news anchor…'

Other
reviewers have labelled the show 'cheesily downmarket' and 
'lackluster', and many have noted Couric's apparent difficulty in 
choosing an angle; she appears to teeter between hard news and daytime 
puff pieces.

Sources report Couric wants the show 
to be news-driven, but that her staff is 'stuck on more evergreen, 
formulaic daytime segments.'

One insider was quoted on Fox News saying, 'Katie has a controlling interest in her show and is not afraid to remind everyone.'

'Katie has stipulated that she will 
only interview Ivy League-type guests, and her blatant disregard for 
producers and executives alike has created such animosity that ABC 
[execs] have made it a top priority to find a replacement next season.'

So
far, Couric has garnered many big-name guests, though certainly not
all Ivy Leaguers, including Manti Te'o, Jessica Simpson, Jennifer Lopez, 
Sofia Vergara and the cast of Mad Men.

Big guests: A recent episode of 'Katie' featured Howard Stern, who turned the tables on his interviewer, quizzing Couric about her outfit choice, her boyfriend and her previous TV shows

Despite this, the show, which screens weekdays at 3pm, has floundered.

'It’s an unmitigated disaster,' Fox News quoted one executive as saying.

'One of the biggest failures ever in syndication. Terrible ratings, no growth, shouldn’t be on the air. Where did it miss the mark? Let’s start with her, she is dreadfully boring. The show offers nothing new to the audience, nothing to say.'

Ratings winner: Couric found success as co-host of NBC's Today show with Matt Lauer, from 1991 until 2006

There are even reports that ABC is seeking to replace Couric with a new daytime talent.

'They [ABC] are desperately running 
around approaching talent and offering to train them to replace her as a
new daytime talk show host,' an insider told Fox News. 'It’s a number one 
priority.'

But a source closely connected to Couric insisted that Couric is working closely with ABC and is still very much wanted by the network.

Anchor: Couric became a CBS Evening News anchor in 2006 and interviewed high-profile guests and world leaders including Bill Gates, President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton

Yet another insider is skeptical that Couric’s show will complete its second season.'There is zero chance is goes to a third season,' quoted Fox News. 'It might not even finish the second.'

A source close to the bubbly star told MailOnline admitted it was 'too early to tell' if Katie would be back for a third season as 'there are so many different factors that make a third season discussion premature.'

It's all speculation until Couric's camp or ABC comment about the future of the show - both have remained tight-lipped on the subject.
