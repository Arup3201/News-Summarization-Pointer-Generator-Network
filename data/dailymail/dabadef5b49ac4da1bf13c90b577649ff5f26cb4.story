Jose Mourinho has taken a vow of silence after being charged with misconduct by the FA for claiming there is a campaign against his Chelsea team.

The Chelsea manager bailed out of his usual media duties on Friday within minutes of the FA confirming that he had been charged following his comments at Southampton.

Mourinho lost it with referee Anthony Taylor after he booked Cesc Fabregas for simulation when he should have been awarded a penalty when he was fouled by Saints left-back Matt Targett in the 55th minute.

Chelsea had sent a circular to the media on Thursday afternoon confirming his usual pre-match press conference ahead of their clash with Newcastle United at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. Within minutes of the FA’s announcement assistant manager Steve Holland was substituted.

Mourinho has until 6pm on January 13 to respond to the FA charge and can request a personal hearing following Thursday’s statement by the game’s governing body.

An FA spokesman said: ‘It is alleged his remarks constitute improper conduct in that they allege and/or imply bias on the part of a referee or referees and/or bring the game into disrepute.’

Mourinho made the remarks following the 1-1 draw with Southampton at St Mary’s on January 28 and has refused to apologise or retract them.

At the time he said: ‘The media, commentators, other managers are all doing it [putting pressure on referees]. 

‘There is a campaign against Chelsea. I don't know why there is this campaign and I do not care. Everybody knows it was a penalty.' 

The Chelsea chief has already been formally warned about his behaviour after demanding a strong performance from referee Neil Swarbrick before their 2-0 victory over Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium.

The FA added: ‘Having sought his observations on this matter, the FA has decided not to bring a disciplinary charge and instead issued him with a formal warning.

'The FA prohibit participants from making any pre-match media comments, including comments of a positive nature concerning the appointed match officials for a particular fixture.’
