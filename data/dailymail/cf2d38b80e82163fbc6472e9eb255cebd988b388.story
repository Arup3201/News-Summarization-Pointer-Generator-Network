Health experts have today warned of a rising tide of dengue fever cases in England, as infected travellers jumped 60 per cent in a year.

More people are returning from infected areas of the world, bringing the viral illness home with them.

Public Health England (PHE) said cases soared by 58 per cent from 2012 to 2013.

Last year there were 541 cases reported in people returning from dengue-affected countries across the world.

Public Health England has warned of a rise in the number of travellers returning to England with dengue fever, a viral infection spread by mosquitoes

That number is compared to 343 cases in 2012.

A PHE spokesman said most cases were reported in travellers who had visited India and Thailand.

But officials have also noted an increase in cases associated with travel to Barbados last year.

Dengue is a viral infection spread by mosquitoes. Symptoms of include a severe flu-like illness, fever, headache, muscle ache, rash, nausea and vomiting.

PHE also said the number of chikungunya fever cases have risen from 15 in 2012 to 24 in 2013.

It is a viral illness with similar symptoms to dengue fever but joint pain may be a more prominent symptom.

Most patients make a full recovery but in some cases joint pain and arthritis can persist for several months or even years.

Dr Jane Jones, travel and migrant health expert at PHE, said: 'Dengue fever and chikungunya are unpleasant viral illnesses that are transmitted by day-biting mosquitoes.

'As there is no specific preventive medicine or vaccination against dengue fever or chikungunya, prevention relies on avoiding mosquito bites particularly around dusk and dawn when the day biting mosquitoes are most active.'

The number of cases has risen by 60 per cent from 2012 to 2013. A Public Health England spokesman said most travellers have contracted the illness in India and Thailand, but increasing numbers were associated with travel to Barbados (pictured) last year

Dengue is a common viral infection spread by mosquitoes.

It is common in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world.

Symptoms include:

Dengue is spread by infected mosquitoes. An infected human is bitten by the mosquito, the infected mosquito then bites another human and the cycle continues.

The condition is widespread in areas with a high mosquito populations.

Dengue usually clears up by itself within two to three weeks.

There are no specific medications to treat the disease but symptoms can be managed using paracetamol.

A number of people will go on to suffer a more serious form of the illness, known as 'severe dengue'.

It is a potentially fatal complication which can lead to shock, bleeding and organ damage.
