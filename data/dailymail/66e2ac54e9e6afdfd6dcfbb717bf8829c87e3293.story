Sarah Silverman is coming under fire for a list of ten 'rape prevention tips' that she shared on Twitter, because they offer tongue-in-cheek advice to men.

The post, which has been retweeted nearly 5,000 times, includes points such as 'don't put drugs in women's drinks' and 'when you see a woman walking by herself, leave her alone'.

She posted a graphic of the tips, writing: 'These are great - send to all the men in ur life.'

But dozens of angry men on Twitter seized on her joke, tweeting in to call her 'sexist' and saying it was 'offensive' to imply that all men are looking for ways to rape women.

A tongue-in-cheek list of rape prevention tips that are aimed at the attacker have gone viral on Twitter 

Sarah Silverman tweeted the list with a post advising people to 'send it to all the men in ur life' 

Although the Ten Rape Prevention Tips have been shared and favourited thousands of times, the comedian faced a backlash on social media, with men calling them 'degrading' and 'sexist'.

The sarcastic set of rules, which focus on the perpetrator of the crime rather than the victim, also include 'if you are in an elevator and a woman gets in, don't rape her', as well as 'when you encounter a woman who is asleep, the safest course of action is not to rape her'.

Number nine on the list is 'carry a rape whistle. If you find you are about to rape someone, blow the whistle until someone comes to stop you'.

And the final one reads: 'Don't forget, honesty is the best policy. When asking a woman out on a date, don't pretend that you are interested in her as a person; tell her straight up that you expect to be raping her later. If you don't communicate your intentions, the woman may take it as a sign that you do not plan to rape her.' 

Silverman is currently dating Welsh actor Michel Sheen - whom she has been with since January 2014. 

Before that, she had a highly publicized romance with late night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel, whom she dated for five years until they split in 2008. 

The set of tips was first shared in a blog on Washington State Coalition Against Domestic Violence back in 2011.

The post was uploaded by Leigh Hofheimer who said a co-worker had produced the set of rules.

Comedian Sarah Silverman shared the list over Twitter dividing the opinion 

Silverman's tweet left many men feeling offended

Social media users said the list suggested  all men were capable of such crimes

Hofheimer wrote: 'I couldn’t decide if I should laugh or be horrified by the reality that violence prevention tips are always aimed at what the targeted person should do (judgment strongly implied) to protect themselves.'

Despite being almost four years old, the list has caused controversy after being tweeted by the comedian.

Silverman's tweet has received a mixed reaction from the public.

Although Silverman did not write the list some users attacked her directly in response to the list

However several users argued that the list pointed out that victims are too often blamed for their attacks

The list has divided opinions with some feminists arguing it shows it is not victims who need to change their behaviour but the attacker.

D Kramer wrote: 'I get the point, we always tells the women they are responsible to prevent rape & not the men.' 

However, men on Twitter have hit out at the list implying that it's all men who would commit such crimes.

Zac Lee posted: 'It's extremely offensive. It implies that it's common for men to think about ways to rape girls, when that's nonsense.'

Another user wrote: 'This is so offensive to men. What an awful subtext you're propagating.' 

And Paul Jukes tweeted: 'Rather harsh on those of us who, you know, wouldn't dream of hurting anyone.'

User Ben Morpy wrote: 'I feel like battling sexism with sexist propaganda is the best way to promote sexism.' 

This is not Silverman's first controversial tweet involving rape. 

In November last year, the 44-year-old comedian came under fire for tweeting a gag about being sexually assaulted by Bill Cosby.

She later removed the post and edited it after causing offense online.
