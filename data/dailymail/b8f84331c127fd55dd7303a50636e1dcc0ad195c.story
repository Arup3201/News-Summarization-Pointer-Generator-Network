Sean Dyche's Burnley earned a shock win against Manchester City to boost their survival hopes and all but end the Manuel Pellegrini's side's hopes of catching Chelsea at the top of the table.

The only goal of the game came from midfielder George Boyd who expertly fired home a volley past Joe Hart in the City goal.

Burnley's win sends them above relegation threatened QPR and leaves Manchester City five points adrift of Chelsea having played two more games than their west London rivals. 

Find out how each player fared at Turf Moor with Sportmail's Craig Hope.

BURNLEY (4-4-2)

Tom Heaton 6.5 – Made a smart save from Dzeko in the first half but will have expected to be tested far more by the champions.

Kieran Trippier 6.5 – Wasn’t able to get forward as much as usual but stuck to his defensive duties and made a great interception header early on.

Michael Duff 6.5 – Recalled to the line-up in place of Keane and hardly put a foot wrong. Booked for a foul on Aguero.

Manchester City's Belgian defender Vincent Kompanyis closed down by Burnley striker Danny Ings

Jason Shackell 7 – A real captain’s display alongside Duff in central defence to keep City’s threat to a bare minimum.

Ben Mee 6 – Former City trainee had his hands full with Zabaleta and was very fortunate not to concede a penalty when he brought him down late on.

George Boyd 8 – Had already gone close with a spectacular volley from the edge of the box before firing the winner with the sweetest of strikes.

Scott Arfield 7 – Tested Hart with decent effort in the first half but excelled in a central, working tirelessly to hold City at bay.

David Jones 7 – Another solid performance from the former Manchester United man, holding things together for Burnley in the heart of midfield.

Ashley Barnes 6 – Showed his versatility by moving wide out on the left to accommodate Vokes and never stopped running.

Danny Ings 7 – Posed a constant problem for Demichelis, and got the Argentine’s forearm in the face for his troubles.

Sam Vokes 6.5 – His first Premier League start for Burnley after a knee injury and kept Kompany on his toes throughout.

Subs: Gilks, Keane, Reid (for Ings 90+3), Ward (for Vokes 87), Jutkiewicz, Wallace, Kightly.

Scorer: Boyd 61

Booked: Mee, Duff

MAN CITY (4-4-2)

Joe Hart 6 – The England keeper had little to do besides pick the ball out of the net and couldn’t be faulted for conceding Boyd’s winner.

Pablo Zabaleta 6.5 – Got forward well as usual but his hard work came to nothing as City wasted what few opportunities came their way.

Vincent Kompany 6 – City skipper was recalled after being dropped for one game, and his clearance header went straight to Boyd for Burnley’s goal.

Martin Demichelis 5 – Struggled to contain Ings. Booked for taking down the Burnley striker and could have seen red for a foul on Trippier shortly afterwards.

Gael Clichy 5 – Failed to get forward enough and offer City a threat down the left. Will now sit out the Barcelona game through suspension.

Jesus Navas 5 – Another lack-lustre showing from the Spain winger who incurred the wrath of Burnley fans who thought he overreacted to get Mee booked.

Yaya Toure 6 – Tried to prompt City into life from midfield but there were none of the driving runs that can make him almost unplayable at times.

Fernandinho 5 – Spent the last week in the headlines for his alleged bust-up with Kompany but did very little of note here apart from one volley high over the bar.

David Silva 5.5 – Strangely subdued display from the Spaniard who is so often City’s creative spark. Subbed by Jovetic having contributed very little.

Sergio Aguero 5.5 – City’s top scorer was off target with a series of attempts on goal and was lucky to escape punishment for a naughty challenge on Duff.

Edin Dzeko 4.5 – A first-time shot that almost hit the corner flag summed up his display and no surprise to see him replaced by Bony with half an hour left.

Subs: Caballero, Sagna, Mangala, Nasri, Lampard (for Toure 81), Jovetic (for Silva 74), Bony (for Dzeko 63).

Booked: Demichelis

Referee: Andre Marriner 5
