A new photograph of Madeleine McCann – dressed as a pumpkin for Halloween – has been released by a campaign group, with the blessing of her parents.

The touching photograph shows a happy and beaming Maddie dressed as an orange pumpkin, wearing white trainers and clutching a cuddly teddy bear, grinning for the camera.

The picture – believed to be one of the favourites of her parents Gerry, 45, and Kate, 46 – was taken  months before the then three-year-old went missing from Praia da Luz resort in Portugal in 2007.

The new picture, showing Madeleine dressed as a pumpkin, left, has been released by a campaign group, with the blessing of her parents. It was published alongside the more well-known picture of her clutching three tennis balls under her chin, right 

The new photo appears on the Facebook page of the Official Find Madeleine Campaign, which is supported by the McCanns.

The photograph was released on Friday to mark Halloween, and appears beside three others of Maddie, including the well-known one of her clutching three tennis balls under her chin.

A source close to the McCanns said: ‘The photo which hasn’t been seen before has been put out as part of the campaign and is authorised by Kate and Gerry.’

The new picture is accompanied by a plea, saying: ‘Someone, somewhere knows where Madeleine is.

'PLEASE come forward if you know anything about her whereabouts.’

Hundreds of well-wishers have left messages of support since the new photo was posted.

One well-wisher, Maxine Hilson, wrote: ‘I pray that these lovely brave people will be reunited with Madeleine one day.

‘My husband was killed by a dangerous driver two years ago but at least I know where he is.’
