A late flurry of goals from Patrick Vieira's Manchester City Under 19s saw them maintain their 100 per cent record in the UEFA Youth League to finish the group stage in style.

City's youngsters netted four times in the final 20 minutes in Italy to make it six wins from six ahead of the upcoming draw for the knockout stages.

The result proved to be a lucky omen with City reaching the Champions League round of 16 following a 2-0 win in the Stadio Olympico.

Bersant Celina, Jack Byrne, Thierry Ambrose and Brandon Barker all found the net for Vieira's side.

But they had goalkeeper Angus Gunn - son of former Norwich No 1 Bryan - to thank for keeping them in the match in the first place.

The 18-year-old pulled off a string of fines saves before City came to life late on.
