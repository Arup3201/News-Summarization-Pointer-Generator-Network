A spy drone commander from Israel has admitted he had made some ‘wrong calls’ when it came to dropping bombs on targets in Gaza.

Major Yair, one of the country’s most experienced unmanned drones commanders, said he had made mistakes but had ‘learnt to live’ with them.

The 31-year-old has served throughout the last three wars in Gaza and is the mission commander of a remotely-piloted Heron TP drone, which locates targets on the ground and fires at them.

Drones are particularly controversial because they are unmanned - and therefore can be used to kill targets without any risk to those who control them.

A staggering 65 per cent of Israel’s military air operations are conducted by drones rather than planes which are manned by military personnel.

He said: ‘You have to make life and death calls in seconds. You spot it – what is it? Shall we take it out or not? You have to develop the mental skills.’

Major Yair told the Telegraph: ‘We do make mistakes. But it’s nature. People make mistakes. We learn from those mistakes. You’ll see no smiling face after an incident where kids are killed.

‘None of us want to be in a position where he does these mistakes. We learn and try to avoid this as much as we can.’

Of the 2,192 Palestinians who were killed during the last conflict, 519 were children under the age of 18, according to the United Nations.

After three Gaza wars, Major Yair said he had made some ‘wrong calls’ himself. He added: ‘You learn to live with it.

‘It’s not easy. I’ve made mistakes that, for many years, will come back at me.

‘But it’s something that people have to do. It’s not easy. We do not shove it back somewhere in our minds and try to avoid talking about it.’

Speaking about the imbalance of risk between the enemy and those in control of the drones, he said: ‘Does it change the way you make calls? The fact you’re comfortable – it means you make better calls.’
