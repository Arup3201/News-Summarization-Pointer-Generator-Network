A woman, who tipped the scales at over fifteen stone and was dumped by her boyfriend, is getting back on the dating radar after a dramatic weightloss.

Zoe Hammonds was dumped two years ago when she struggled to fit into a size 22 
dress - but after eighteen months of failing to find herself a new man 
has now got in shape.

The 34-year-old from Leicester shed an impressive six stone and with the new-found confidence, has now gone on her first date in two years.

Zoe Hammonds was dumped two years ago and after eighteen months of failing to land a man - she decided to get in shape

And to add to her first step back onto the love scene, since her incredible weightloss, a man she used to be in love with is now begging to date her.

The British Gas sales manager, who kept a photo diary and journal marking her amazing progress each month, has impressed friends and colleagues after ditching her former diet of cheesecake, pizzas, profiteroles and chocolate.

She said: 'My boyfriend broke up with me two years ago. I wasn’t feeling good and I’ve been single since then.

'It was pretty frustrating but dating has significantly increased since I lost the weight. Now I’m going on my first date for two years.

Zoe is now filled with confidence and excited to be dating again

'A man who I was in love with has come back and said he is now interested in me.

'Lots of other people I used to like have come back to me and asked me out as well but I tell them all the same thing - you snooze, you lose.

'You could have had this amazing, witty, thin girlfriend with a great personality. But it’s too late, you had your chance.

'When I got to size 16, loads of lads at work started complementing me.

'At size 12 - the offers of dates started coming in and random people started asking me out on facebook.

'Due to being overweight for so long, I am actually quite shy and not used to people complimenting me on how I look but I am now slowly beginning to enjoy it.

Zoe has now started to become a little braver and is taking a few of these suitors up on their offers, and she is on the look out for Mr Charming.

'It is fair to say I have been pretty unlucky in love to date so I’m excited to see if the increase in volumes also brings with it an increase in calibre.

'I am excited about dating now because I also think I will pick better, as when I look back now I think I have always felt like I am not good enough in relationships and this has meant that I have not always spoken up when I have been unhappy about something possibly because I am scared they will leave.

'When you’re fat you’re invisible. Even now I still feel fat in my mind because I lost the weight so quickly.

A man who she was once in love with has even come running back

'The extra attention I’m now getting was scary as hell. I’m not used to people commenting on my body.

Another reason for her changing her attitude towards her weight was when her father fell ill with a kidney infection.

Added to that, one of her best friends was diagnosed and battling with terminal cancer, which changed her outlook on life.

'It gave me the wake up call I needed to recognise that even though I have always given the impression of being confident and happy being overweight and feeling unattractive has been holding me back for years.

Zoe's friends can't believe the difference, Zoe lost weight by slimming on just 500 calories a day

'People always tell you that in your 30s all you spend your time doing is going to births, deaths and weddings and that has definitely been true, but having been single for two years now I have found myself playing the Hugh Grant character in Four Weddings & A Funeral going to these events alone.

'Watching friends getting married and having children has only reminded me that I have always wanted those things and at the age of 34 and spending lots of time focusing on my career I seem no closer to achieving them.

'For the first time ever I now love shopping, as I do not have to go to fat shops, and can buy things off the rack and know that it will fit.

In just six months Zoe dropped an incredible 12 dress sizes and six stone in weight

'When you are overweight shopping in special shops is not good for your confidence and the choice is limited,' she said,

Since she started the Lighter Life diet programme, Zoe eats about a fifth of what she used to eat and only eats their specific food packs which equate to 500 calories a day.

Since she has ditched her original diet of chocolate, cheese and pizza, she feels much healthier and happy and visits the gym three times a week.

'Since losing the weight I’m happier, more confident and believe anything is possible.'
