Alec Baldwin has been accused of unleashing a racist rant on a New York Post photographer outside his apartment building, but the actor has claimed that HE is the victim of harassment.

Photographer and retired NYPD detective G.N. Miller got into the altercation with Baldwin as he staked out the actor's Manhattan home following news that his wife is being sued by a yoga student.

Following the spat, the police were called and Miller, 56, and Baldwin, 54, both filed harassment claims against each other.

The 30 Rock star allegedly called 
Miller, who is black, a racial epithet, a 'coon', 'a drug dealer', a 
'crackhead' and made disparaging remarks about his mother, according to 
Miller's police statement.

He also told the photographer to 
'suck my d***' as pedestrians walked past, and when Miller showed him ID
to prove he was a retired police officer, Baldwin branded it 'fake', 
Miller said.

'He was saying some serious racist 
stuff,' Miller told the New York Post. 'He could have said a lot of other stuff. But he used all of the stereotypes associated with black people.'

Before
the altercation on Sunday morning, Baldwin had been approached by a New
York Post reporter and was asked for a comment about the lawsuit 
against his wife, Hilaria.

The Post claims that Baldwin then grabbed the female reporter by her arm and said: 'I want you to choke to death.'

She allegedly recorded the comment and played it to police.

But Baldwin took to Twitter to share his side of the story, referring to the photographer as 'Ralston'.

'Moments after I tweet about the Post, 
Ralston, the ex-crackhead "photographer" shows up at my door w 1 of 
Murdoch's nieces in tow,' he wrote, in a tweet that has now been deleted.

'Ralston claims he's ex NYPD!! That can't be!!! Ex NYPD don't become crackhead, ex jailhouse paparazzi!' he wrote in another message.

In other tweets, that still remain on his page, he added: 'Thank u 2 NYPD officers who came to my 
home 2day so that I could file a formal complaint against NY Post "photographer" who assaulted me.'

Anger: Baldwin disputed the claims on his Twitter account, and thanked the NYPD for intervening

Defense: He noted he had given money to a foundation in the legacy of Arthur Ashe - a black tennis player

Sticking up for her man: Hilaria Baldwin also used Twitter to attack the media and defend her husband

In his own complaint, Baldwin told police that the photographer 'pushed into him' and asked him to keep his distance, but Miller said it was the actor who bumped him in the chest, the Post reported.

Through his spokesperson, Baldwin 
responded to accusations of racist remarks, saying: 'That's one of the 
most outrageous things I've heard in my life.'

Neither of the complaints will go any further, except in possible civil action, the Post reported.

It is not the first time Baldwin has got into a spat with a photographer. In June, the New York Daily News captured the actor shoving one of their photographers after he picked up his marriage license.

The altercation with Miller came after a distraught New Yorker filed a suit against Baldwin's wife, claiming he endured harsh conditions during a yoga class she conducted.

Spencer Wolff says he suffered 'serious' and 'severe' injuries and ‘emotional upset' during Hilaria Baldwin's January 15 class at Yoga Vida in Greenwich Village, according to the lawsuit.

The lawsuit does not specify exactly how Wolff was injured. But he does cite the 'overcrowded' class and Ms Baldwin's 'negligence' as two of the causes of his alleged injuries.

Ms Baldwin, 28, has been teaching yoga since 2005, according to Yoga Vida’s website. The couple married in June and Ms Baldwin is pregnant with their first child.

Alec Baldwin disputed the claims, tweeting: 'The class was, IN NO WAY, "dangerously crowded".'
