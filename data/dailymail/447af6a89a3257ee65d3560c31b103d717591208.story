The American president's travel plans could involved a ride in the high-tech helicopter Marine One, while a number of other identical helicopters fly alongside him as decoys.

Meanwhile, most of the other world leaders as well as the 4,000 delegates attending the event on November 15 and 16, are expected to travel along the closed off lanes in motorcades that are not required to stop at red lights.

Mr Obama is expected to fly into the country on his private customised plane, Air Force One for the world summit.

It is unclear whether his limousine, nicknamed the Beast, will also be transported over for his use.

The Secret Service car is believed to be fitted with armored-plates and include 5-inch multi-layer windows as well as being sealed against biochemical attacks, and follows him wherever he travels.

He is also rumored to be the only leader hiring out an entire hotel for his entourage and himself while in the country.

Police and the Queensland government have already begun conducting major simulation exercises for the event from the point where delegates arrive at the airport to when they are transported and driven across the designated roads.
