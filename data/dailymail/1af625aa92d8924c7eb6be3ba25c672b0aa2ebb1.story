Surrounded by glorious yellow, Stephanie Koch and her three-year-old daughter Kadie don sunglasses for a walk in the sunshine through a rapeseed field in Whitley Bay, north-east England.

Yesterday was one of the hottest days of the year so far and thousands of people took the opportunity to spend a few hours at the seaside.

The Met Office reported unbroken sunshine with roads to coastal resorts clogged with extra traffic.

In Bournemouth, the beach was almost overrun with sun-worshippers basking in temperatures of up to 25C. A weekend outside school holidays would normally see a maximum of 20,000 people heading to the town, but that number almost quadrupled yesterday.

A spokesman for Bournemouth Tourism said: ‘This is what we have been waiting for. The hotels and restaurants are looking forward to this weather continuing. Let’s hope it lasts.’

It was a similar picture in Brighton, where tens of thousands of residents and visitors flocked to the beach.

Adam Bates, spokesman for Visit Brighton, said: ‘It is absolutely heaving here. There is a carnival atmosphere.’

The forecast for today is for more fine and dry weather.

Temperatures will again reach 25C, but it will be slightly cooler in some breezy coastal areas.

Yesterday, Britain was hotter than showery Alexandria, Egypt, which only reached 24C, and Safed, Israel, which saw 25C.

Temperatures were a staggering 20C warmer than last Saturday, when snow fell and frost hit parts of the North, which saw highs of just 8C after a -4C night.

Scotland, which hit 28.7C on Friday at Kinlochewe, Ross and Cromarty, enjoyed its second hottest May heatwave in 102 years of records. The only hotter May spell was the 29.0C record at Edinburgh in 1992. This is Scotland’s hottest weather at any time of year since 2009.

England’s 28.5C at Bournemouth, on Friday, shattered local records. England’s record May temperature is 32.8C, dating from 1922 and 1944.

Independent forecasters said the hot spell was the nation's best period of weather for two years and the early summer sizzle is expected to return for next weekend’s Diamond Jubilee too.

Meanwhile, tourism is enjoying an estimated £1billion spending boost as Brighton reported 150,000 visitors - matching peak summer days - with Blackpool seeing 100, and Bournemouth 35,000.

Similar numbers are expected today with Bournemouth’s ice-cream sellers ordering extra stocks as 30,000 cones are expected to be sold.

Meanwhile, swimmers had a shock as giant sharks were spotted off beaches in Cornwall and the Isle of Man.

But beachgoers can relax as they are harmless seven-metre basking sharks, the world’s second largest fish, drawn towards land by soaring sea temperatures. They have been sighted 30 times this week.

Despite the early start he was cheered on by hundreds of fans as he made his way across the bay under a clear blue sky.

Matt, 29, said: 'It’s a huge privilege. A once in a lifetime thing.'

But it wasn't all good news. Roads were clogged with the AA seeing an expected 10 per cent breakdowns spike due to overheating, with jams expected on beach routes including the A31 in Hampshire, A23 in Sussex and M55 in Lancashire.

Train firms expected a 25 per cent surge in passenger numbers on coastal routes, with the threat of more speed restrictions after Network Rail ordered East Midlands Trains to slow down this week when rails expanded.

On Friday, temperatures rocketed to 28C in Bournemouth, hotter than Athens which reached 24C, while Casablanca in Morocco could only manage 22C.

Supermarkets reported a surge in sales of sausages and burgers for the barbecue, while at Goodwood racecourse, in West Sussex, horses had to be doused in water in between races to keep them cool.

Tens of thousands of children and adults turned out in the sunshine and lined the streets of Abergavenny, Monmouth and Raglan to wave the Olympic torch along the Welsh leg of its journey.

In Bristol and London hundreds packed into the city’s open air swimming pools to make the most of the hot temperatures.

Forecasters say the hot, dry weather will remain for much of the UK over the weekend and into Monday, before breaking on Tuesday, when temperatures are likely to drop as rain returns.

Easterly winds from the Continent and a high pressure system over the Northern Isles have caused temperatures to reach almost 10C higher than the average for this time of year. The May average for London is 17C, and while in June it is 20.4C.

Forecaster Sally Webb said: ‘Most places are still warm and hot, with temperatures over the seasonal average.

‘Most of the UK will be sunny and very warm on Saturday, but showers could reach the end of Cornwall by late afternoon

‘Sunday will continue to be dry and sunny, although there is a chance of it being cloudier. There might also be showers in the South-West in areas like Devon and South Wales.’

The hot weather is not agreeing with everyone. David Cameron revealed the soaring temperatures have brought on an attack of hay fever.

The Prime Minister told ITV’s This Morning that he had to take medication to combat the condition.

‘There’s obviously one or two plants that, when they flower, hit me and so, just this morning, I woke up and I had it,’ he said.

The hot spell is also doing little to ease the drought conditions affecting much of the South and South-East.

According to the Environment Agency, this week has been the driest since the end of March, with less than 0.08 inches falling in the South-East and 0.35 inches in the North.

Average maximum temperatures for England in May are 14C to 17C, while Scotland would normally be 13C to 15C.
