The villa once rented by Brigitte Bardot is up for sale for around £6 million, and has 14 suite bedrooms and a jacuzzi with room for 16

Brigitte Bardot once lived in the luxurious villa located just outside Cannes

Situated just 30 minutes from Cannes, the building is situated in an area steeped in history, and with famous visitors choosing this home as their preferred holiday escape.

Offering panoramic vistas and complete privacy, the  stone-built villa, which is divided into two separate buildings, was constructed on a prestigious estate dating back hundreds of years.

Draped in foliage, the villa has been carefully and loving restored and renovated.

The 450 square-metre property is certainly a good option for a film star.

It's location near Cannes, perfect for the annual Film Festival, and its 14 bedrooms - meaning plenty of stars can come and visit - make it an entertainer's dream.

The two houses on the property also come with two heated swimming pools, an al-fresco 'summer kitchen', and mature fruit trees.

There are even wine-producing vineyards and impressive ancient olive trees for those who are inclined to create their own produce.

Estate agents Fine & Country describe the villa as 'paradise found for the discerning modern buyer'. 

As expected, there is multiple spacious living and entertaining areas, magnificent gardens with panoramic views and plenty of garage space for a fleet of cars.

There is also a 16 seater Jacuzzi - perfect for relaxing with a glass of Champagne with friends, and landscaped gardens, complete with ponds, for relaxing in the sunshine in summer.

Bardot was born in Paris on September 28, 1934, and after originally starting out with ballet as a child, she soon caught the eye of fashion photographers.

The villa has an enchanting feel about it, and gives you an opportunity to walk in the footsteps of a true screen star

The serene swimming pool is perfect for those early morning lengths, or maybe just to relax with a nice glass of fizz

Despite a fairly minimalist look, the bedroom of Brigitte Bardot's old home oozes style and class with a well-matched decor 

After success appearing in the likes of Elle Magazine, she was cast in a number of films, but despite her beautiful looks and sex appeal, she rejected overtures to turn her hand to the US film scene, instead starring in French cinema.

Just before her 39th birthday, Bardot's career took a very different turn as she announced her retirement from film and became an animal rights activist. 

In 1986, she established the Brigitte Bardot Foundation for the Welfare and Protection of Animals and has campaigned for animal rights for many years.

The 80-year-old is with her fourth husband, Bernard d'Ormale, former adviser of Jean-Marie Le Pen, former leader of the far right party Front National; they have been married since August 16, 1992.

She has one son, Nicolas-Jacques Charrier, who was born in 1960 with second husband Jacques Charrier. 

The dining area looks like it has been plucked straight from a dolls house, the candle chandelier add a real buzz of romanticism to the area

Estate agents describe the villa as 'paradise found for the discerning modern buyer', and it is certainly fit for star treatment

The views from the property are stunning, and with neighbours visible, but not near enough to take away from the privacy of the residence
