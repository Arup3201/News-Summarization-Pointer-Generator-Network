The skies in downtown Minneapolis and St. Paul have become a conspiracy theorist's delight as the skies swarm with black helicopters on a mysterious training exercise.

The low-flying black helicopters - also known as Night Stalkers - are flying on the training exercise for the Department of Defense but no one at that agency will comment on the exercise's purpose.  

The only statement they will make regarding the appearance of the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment is to apologize for 'any alarm or inconvenience' they might cause.

The military has declined any comment on the exercise beyond apologizing for any inconvenience

CBS Minnesota reports that the Night Stalkers Web site lists their motto as to 'guard my unit's mission with secrey, for my only true
 ally is the night and the element of surprise.'

They support special ops teams such as the Navy SEALS.

It goes on to call the group 'highly trained and ready to accomplish the very toughest missions 
in all environments, anywhere in the world, day or night, with 
unparalleled precision.'

But that secrecy doesn't sit well with the people watching from below.

'I think the scale of domestic military exercises is not a good 
idea,' Minneapolis resident Daniel Feidt told CBS Minnesota. 'It’s a waste of 
taxpayer money. It’s inappropriate for Special Forces to be operating in American cities.'

St. Paul City Council 
member Chris Tolbert also had strong words for the exercise.

'I think it's outrageous,' Tolbert told the Pioneer Press. 'We're going to have Black 
Hawks flying at a low level over a densely populated urban area without 
any notice at all? I had helicopters shaking my house at 11:57 last 
night. They were right over the trees.'

Police say the exercise has been planned for months but that they cannot release time or locations to the public over security concerns

Local police said the exercise has been planned for months but they were unable to inform the public of the times and locations due to security concerns.

They also described the event as routine training. 

The military often puts pilots into unfamiliar surroundings so they are forced to adapt quickly, as they would during a real mission.
