Sensational footage has emerged showing the father of one of the three schoolgirl 'jihadi brides' at the head of an Islamist rally led by hate preacher Anjem Choudary and attended by Michael Adebowale, the killer of soldier Lee Rigby.

The video shows Abase Hussen marching at the front of the demonstrators, behind a banner reading: 'The followers of Mohammed will conquer America'.

He was filmed chanting 'Allahu Akbar' amid dozens of protesters and standing just yards away as the American flag is burned.

Cuddly: Hussen appealing for the return of his 'jihadi daughter' a few weeks ago after she ran off

Earlier this month, Mr Hussen blamed police for placing a 'heavy burden' on his daughter by handing her the letter about their inquiry - and the police apologised. 

Yesterday, a Government report on foreign fighters was released containing testimony from Mr Hussen.

But at no time has he mentioned his own passion for militant Islam or attendance at one of the most notorious rallies of the last few years. 

Hannah Stuart, domestic extremism expert at the Henry Jackson Society, said: 

'We saw Mr Hussen on TV looking very innocent, holding a teddy bear. But he was linked with individuals who espouse an extremist ideology.

'The impression given was that Islamic extremism was an alien world to his daughter. This footage suggests it wasn't.'

Mr Hussen's daughter, Amira Abase, 15, fled the UK with two of her closest friends to join Islamic State last month sparking a national outcry.

Mr Hussen, who is originally from Ethiopia, led public appeals for her return as their families blamed the authorities for failing to stop them.

He addressed MPs at the Home Affairs Select Committee and was filmed appealing for help while clutching his daughter's teddy bear. 

Last night, Scotland Yard said it would examine the footage to see if any criminal offences had been committed.

Sinister: Also at the rally was Michael Adebowale who went on to murder soldier Lee Rigby the following year

A spokesman said: 'We will review any material brought to our attention which purports to show any criminal offence taking place.'

Radical: Amira Abase, 15, daughter of Abase Hussen, travelled to Syria with two other girls

Mr Hussen was caught on camera in one of a wave of terrifying demonstrations that took place across the world in September 2012.

Two men were arrested as the angry mob called for shariah law to be imposed across the UK.

Amira Abase fled the UK with her friends Shamima Begum, 15, and Khadiza Sultana, 16, last month.

The trio were following in the footsteps of a fourth girl from their school, Bethnal Green Academy, in East London, who left for Syria in December.

Their decision to throw themselves into the hands of the brutal Islamic State terrorist group sparked a national outcry.

Prime Minister David Cameron led calls for everyone to examine what is motivating our young people to join the barbaric organisation.

Earlier this week Mr Hussen travelled to Turkey with relatives of the other two girls.

He has since returned to the flat he shares with his wife in East London but could not be contacted last night.

Speaking while in Turkey, he said: 'I don't know how to explain. I can't describe my feelings. 'I feel like my girl is next to me when I find someone that's on their last journey who saw them. I feel like my daughter is next to me – that's the feelings I have.'

Thousands took to the streets to protest against an obscure film called Innocence of Muslims, which was criticised for ridiculing Islam.

In London, more than 150 clashed with police outside the U.S. Embassy in Mayfair as they chanted 'burn, burn USA' and 'Allahu Akbar' (God is great).

Images posted online show Mr Hussen at the head of the march, reaching towards an Israeli flag as it is burned. A U.S. stars and stripes was also set on fire.

His distinctive face can also be seen as the march moves along the street beside a line of police carriers and officers. 

Among the rabble-rousers at the march was notorious hate preacher Choudary, with Adebowale at his side.

Fanaticism: Footage of the controversial rally showed Mr Hussen chanting among the crowds of protesters. The demonstration, held in 2012, was led by firebrand preacher Anjem Choudary and attended by Lee Rigby's killer

Extremist: The protest was led by the hate preacher and notorious rabble rouser Anjem Choudary, who made a speech saying that Sharia would take over the entire world, including America and the UK

Shocking: Scotland Yard said it would examine the footage (pictured) to see if any criminal offences had been committed

Their lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said: 'Of course they feel responsible for their own children that goes without saying.

'But the fact is these girls were school children and much of what took place clearly took place at school.'
