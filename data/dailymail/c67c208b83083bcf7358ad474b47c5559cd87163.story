A 16-year-old girl arrested on Saturday after allegedly strangling her 43-year-old boyfriend to death during a consensual sex game will be charged with second-degree murder as an adult.

Glendale police say that Jessica Burlew told them she used electrical wire to garote Jason Ash but when he lost consciousness she began to cut him with a razor blade to wake him.

When he failed to respond she told officers that she continued to cut him to 'relieve her own stress', according to court documents posted at Maricopa County Attorney's Office today.

Charged: This is Jessica Burlew - who calls herself Xenia Mex on her Facebook profile. She has been charged with 2nd degree murder after allegedly strangling her 43-year-old boyfriend (Jason Ash - believed to be pictured with Jessica - right) to death

Ash was declared dead at 5.45 pm on Saturday after emergency services were called by Burlew's mother, Tracey Woodside to their Phoenix apartment.

Woodside told police that she left her 16-year-old daughter, who suffers from schizophrenia and autism, alone with Ash and returned when Burlew phoned her to say that the 43-year-old man had been hurt.

According to Glendale police, Burlew told them that she and Ash would often get involved in auto-erotic asphyxiation games prior to having sex.

Woodside told police that when she arrived at her home she was met by her daughter who led her into a bedroom where she was confronted with the sight of Ash fully clothed, save for unbuttoned pants.

She then attempted to perform CPR until emergency responders arrived - but Ash was pronounced dead later according to AZCentral.com

Burlew was reportedly arrested wearing a burka and when questioned by police gave her name as Xenia Mex.

Glendale police Sgt. Jay O'Neill said Jason Ash was found lifeless Saturday evening with multiple cuts to his body and a cord around his neck.

O'Neill said that Burlew told police the pair was involved in a 'consensual sex act involving strangulation,' but that things went wrong.

Tracey Woodside told ABC 15 that her daughter is mentally ill and 'really confused and does not understand what happened.
