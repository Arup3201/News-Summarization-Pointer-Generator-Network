An unattended flash drive found in a bathroom on a New York-bound American Airlines flight caused a bomb scare, which led to the plane's emergency landing in Missouri this afternoon.

The flash drive, it turns out, actually was a small camera disguised as a flash drive.

The American Airlines flight, which originated in San Francisco and was scheduled to land at New York's JFK airport, was forced to land at Kansas City International Airport about 1:30 p.m. after a passenger found the tiny device taped to a wall in the plane's bathroom.

After the emergency landing, the plane was isolated to one side of the airport as officials investigated the mysterious flash drive.

Additionally, each of the plane's 227 passengers and crew members were ushered off of the aircraft and loaded onto buses as officials investigated the plane.

A flash drive is a tiny piece of computer equipment designed to store and transfer data. It is not an explosive device, or an item banned by the National Transportation Safety Board.

After an extensive search of the aircraft, bomb and arson investigators concluded that there was no bomb. Rather, authorities found, the device was actually a small camera disguised as a flash drive and stashed in the bathroom.

It remains unclear who planted the device in the bathroom.

Passengers and crew members were able to re-board the aircraft at about 3 p.m., according to KCTV.

Last month, Kansas City experienced another bomb scare when someone called a bomb threat into its City Hall. In that case, authorities found nothing suspicious after an extensive search of the building.
