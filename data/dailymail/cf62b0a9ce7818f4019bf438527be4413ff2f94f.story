These are the heartwarming pictures of a two-year-old boy after doctors successfully removed a 33lb tumour that weighed more than the child carrying it.

Jesus Rodriguez, from the northern state of Durango, Mexico, was born with a benign lump, which grew to take over the right side of his body, stretching from his armpit to his hip.

Now, after doctors in Mexico City managed to safely remove the tumour, Jesus is back with his delighted family and on the road to recovery.

Dr Gustavo Hernandez, director of 
pediatrics at La Raza hospital where the operation took place, said the 
tumour was heavier than Jesus, who weighed 26lbs when he went in for 
surgery two weeks ago.

It took doctors at the Mexico City hospital 10 hours to remove the giant growth, according to Dr Hernandez.

But miraculously, it went without a hitch, and the boy is now recovering well.

Dr Hernandez said the surgery marked the first time Mexican doctors had removed a tumour larger than the person who had it.

In August 2010, doctors removed a tumour weighing nearly 56lb from the womb of a 54-year-old Argentinian woman.

The massive lump was one of the biggest tumours that has ever been cut out, medics said.

It had been growing inside the woman for 18 months and weighed the equivalent of an average four-year-old or a set of quintuplets.

The patient, who before surgery could barely walk or bend down to tie her shoelaces, was discharged weighing over 70lb less than when she was admitted to hospital.
