William Hague has been berated by rock star Noel Gallagher for attending an awards ceremony instead of ‘sorting out’ the Syria crisis.

The former Oasis star ridiculed the Foreign Secretary’s decision to turn up for the GQ Men of the Year Awards ‘with all the s*** going on all over the world’.

With London Mayor Boris Johnson also in attendance, Gallagher likened the star-studded bash to the Tory party conference.

Mr Hague spent the day being tackled by MPs over how the government will respond to the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime in Syria.

But as US President Barack Obama outlined plans for missile strikes, Mr Hague last night walked up the red carpet with musicians, comedians and models.

As Gallagher was named Icon of the Year by GQ magazine, he used his acceptance speech to question why one of the most senior members of the government had time to attend a celebrity party.

‘Welcome to the Tory party conference by the way,’ he said. ‘Is this what it’s like at the Tory party conference?’

Pointing at Mr Hague he added: ‘It’s nice to see the Foreign Secretary here while there's s**** going on all over the world he should be sorting out.

‘Good for you!’ he added to applause from the audience.

Gallagher went on to thank ‘Dylan, Lennon and McCartney, Townshend, and Morrissey and Marr and all those other people I have been robbing for the last 20 years’.

Mr Hague had arrived at the event with wife Ffion to present the award for writer of the year to journalist Charles Moore.

But it was Mr Johnson he took home a gong for Politician of the Year ‘after delivering a spectacular Olympic Games’ and ‘soaring on a wave of popularity’ while ‘expertly dodging the incessant rumours about when, rather than if, he would set his eyes on Number 10’.

GQ added: ‘At the goings on in Westminster village seem increasingly stale and lifeless - hello, Ed Miliband - Boris never fails to take an eruditely outspoken view, and it seems the public agrees with him.’
