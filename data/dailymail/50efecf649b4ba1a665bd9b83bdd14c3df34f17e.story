Police have returned a life-size statue of President Barack Obama that went missing from its owner's northeastern Pennsylvania porch and was found a few days later reclining on a nearby park bench with a six-pack of Twisted Tea.

The owner, Tiffany Bruce, says she was relieved to get it back Thursday.

The statue, purchased at a furniture store last year, depicts Obama smiling and sitting casually, his legs crossed and his right arm flung out.

Bruce paid $1,200 for the statue, she told WNEP.

'It’s Obama. Everybody loves Obama. Well, I do,' she said.

Bruce decorated the statue as Santa Claus on Christmas and arranged pumpkins around him on Thanksgiving.

She says her five children love the statue, and she was startled enough by the theft to be hospitalized for a panic attack.

'What did you do with Obama?' the children asked her, according to The Washington Post.

'I freaked,' she told The Scranton Times-Tribune. 'I couldn't breath, my eyes were red and watery.'

She said she was briefly convinced the statue was hidden as a prank, and planned to tie the statue down if it was returned.

The furniture store's employees had been planning to replace it with another statue for free.

It was finally discovered by fisherman Bill Phillips who recognized it from news reports and called the police.

'I just happen to glance down at the 
picnic table down here and I was like no it really isn’t,' he told Eyewitness News.

Bruce said she's happy the ordeal is over.

'I’m
 just glad he is back,' she told reporters. 'I don’t wanna press charges or 
anything. It was probably a stupid prank and they got scared because of 
all the publicity.'
