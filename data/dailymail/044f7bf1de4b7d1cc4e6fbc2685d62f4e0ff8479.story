A lone gunman shot and killed a businessman and injured the man’s son before turning the weapon on himself - after apparently falling out with him over a business deal which had gone wrong.

Peter Thompson, 59, died in the early morning shooting at a farm and horse-riding centre yesterday, and his son John, 36, suffered shotgun wounds to his leg but managed to reach a pub to seek help.

A short time later, the body of Robert McCormick, 53, believed to be the killer, was found in a car near Meadowhead Farm in Auldhouse, Lanarkshire.

Response: Armed police officers attend the scene of a triple shooting at Meadowhead Farm in Auldhouse

A source suggested that Peter Thompson had fallen out over a business deal
with McCormick and owed him money, according to the Daily Record.

However, a source added: 'They might have had their differences but no one can believe it has come to this.'

Last night, police investigations were
underway at the farm, near East Kilbride, and at the Glasgow address of
McCormick, who was a business associate of Peter Thompson.

Officers have urged the public to remain calm and it is believed the Thompsons were deliberately  targeted.

As the full horror of the scene 
unfolded, it emerged that Peter and John Thompson had been made bankrupt
in the past, and the older man had been involved in at least one 
planning row.

Police Scotland have said they are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.

Shock: Peter Thompson was found dead at the scene in Scotland, along with the 53-year-old gunman

Marching: Armed officers swooped on the farm at 8am yesterday after John Thompson escaped the scene

Peter Thompson had been at the centre
of a dispute over illegal dumping near the farm and angry locals had 
complained to South Lanarkshire Council about him.

'They might have had their differences but no one can believe it has come to this'

Local source

One shocked neighbour in Auldhouse 
said: ‘I woke up this morning about 8am after hearing a helicopter 
overhead.

'It kept flying back and forth and then landed somewhere 
nearby, then I heard a police car and an ambulance.

‘I went out and spoke to one of my neighbours who said someone had been shot.

‘More police arrived and closed off the whole area. Soon word spread that it was Peter Thompson who had been shot.’

Investigation: Superintendent Elaine Ferguson said police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the shooting

Another added: ‘I couldn’t believe it 
when I heard there had been a shooting. When I heard that it had been 
Peter Thompson I was shocked.

'He has had some run-ins with residents here because of his tipping trucks and the havoc they cause for people living here but I would doubt it would come to this'

‘He has had some run-ins with 
residents here because of his tipping trucks and the havoc they cause 
for people living here but I would doubt it would come to this.’

Peter Thompson ran Meadowhead Farm with his second wife Caron, 38. His son ran a paintballing business from the premises.

Superintendent Elaine Ferguson, of 
Police Scotland, said: ‘We can confirm that at 8.10am Police Scotland 
received a call from ambulance services to reports of a male being shot 
at Meadowhead Farm.

‘Specialist firearms officers attended
along with local officers. Two men, a  59-year-old and a 53-year-old, 
received fatal injuries.

Emergency services raced to the scene at Meadowhead Farm and are now looking for clues to the incident

Officers have urged the public to remain calm and it is believed the Thompsons were deliberately targeted

‘A 36-year-old man was injured and is 
being treated at Hairmyres Hospital. I would like to make it clear that 
there is no threat to the public and we are not looking for anyone else 
in this incident.’

It is understood Mr Thompson Jnr made his way to a pub in nearby Langlands Road, where he raised the alarm.

It is not known if Mrs Thompson, or Mr Thompson Snr’s daughter from his first marriage, Caroline, were at the farm at the time.

A message on the business’s Facebook page last night read: ‘All lessons and treks cancelled until further notice.

‘Also no liveries permitted onto the 
yard until further notice. I have dealt with all the horses and they are
fine. If any liveries have any queries, please phone me directly.’

Police also said armed officers had 
attended a location in Clarkston, Glasgow, in relation to the incident 
at around 10am.

An unnamed male was taken in for questioning. Last 
night, a police car was stationed outside McCormick’s home.

Neighbours said he was in partnership 
with Mr Thompson and also held a firearms licence. He lived alone and 
was described as ‘a bit of a loner’.

One neighbour said: ‘He moved here around five years ago but you only ever saw him coming and going from his car.

‘He was quite a burly man.  He built a fence around his house almost as soon as he moved in.’

Locals said a number of police vehicles arrived at the house early yesterday, with a helicopter circling overhead for a time.

Targeted: Mr Thompson and his son John ran the farm and popular equestrian centre

Last night, leading Scottish 
criminologist Professor David Wilson took to Twitter in an apparent 
attempt to link the tragedy to a new C4 series.

He tweeted: ‘Awful news of double 
shooting in Auldhouse near East Kilbride.

'I did worry that we might see 
this type of incident in wake of #Southcliffe.’

Mr Thompson Snr is listed as a director of two companies and was the boss of a further six firms that have been dissolved.

Police have said the shootings were 'targeted' and they were following a 'positive line of enquiry'

The terrifying incident happened at Meadowhead Farm, south of Glasgow and south-west of Motherwell

The equestrian centre cancelled all its lessons after the shooting incident that killed two men

In April last year, he was hit with a 
£10,000 fine for dumping on an infill site despite an enforcement notice
in place to prevent tipping.

Peter Thompson was made the subject of a sequestration order at 
Hamilton Sheriff Court in 2000, while his son was made bankrupt with 
debts of £256,550 at the same court last year.

The younger man’s paintballing business had been hit with a legal action at the Court of Session in Edinburgh last year.

He had been sued for damages by a man who suffered an injury while paintballing but had been unable to pay.
