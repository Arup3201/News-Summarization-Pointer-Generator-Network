Jo Rust underwent drastic weight loss surgery five years ago after struggling to shed the weight shed piled on after having her children.

After years of failed diets and with her weight sticking stubbornly at 20 stone, Jo Rust decided to have a gastric band fitted.

The mother of two was delighted as the pounds rolled off and her dress size dropped from a 24 to a 12. But her weight kept falling and falling, and then she collapsed at work.

At hospital, doctors assumed the gastric band was too tight and decided to remove it, only to discover her stomach had become tangled in the band and turned gangrenous.

To save her life, surgeons had to remove 90 per cent of her stomach.

Mrs Rust is now a healthy ten-and-a-half stone. But as a result of the surgery she never feels hungry – and has to set an alarm to remind her to eat six times a day.

The operation left her with hardly any stomach lining, which produces the hormone that drives the hunger instinct.

Her remaining stomach is so small that the 47-year-old can eat only tiny portions of food, using a baby’s bowl for her meals.

‘I haven’t felt hungry for months,’ she said yesterday. ‘I think it would take me days before I realised I haven’t eaten without the alarm reminder.

Before having a gastric band fitted, Mrs Rust (pictured in 2007)  says she would devour biscuits, crisps, sandwiches and sausage rolls for lunch - and she would binge on sweets once a week

‘When I was not working and recovering
at home I found it easier to remember, but now I am back at work full 
time it is so easy to let it slip my mind.

‘The alarm is also important as it 
makes my colleagues aware that I need to have something to eat, 
otherwise meetings can go on for hours and I could be starving without 
knowing it.

‘When I had the band I still felt 
hungry, but it stopped me overeating. Now I have to force myself to eat 
when I am not hungry. It is completely different psychologically.’

Due to a freak complication surgeons had to remove the majority of Mrs Rust's stomach, which means she never feels hungry. She now has to set an alarm on her phone to remind her to eat

Mrs Rust, of King’s Lynn, Norfolk, went up to 20 stone after having her daughters Holly, now 25, and Emilia, 21.

The mother-of-two has dropped nine stone to weigh a healthy 11 stone 7lb

At work she would eat biscuits, crisps, sandwiches and sausage rolls for lunch and then binge on sweets.

She had the gastric band fitted in 
2007 and slimmed to 11-and-a-half stone by eating three small meals a 
day and exercising. However as the band failed her weight dropped 
further. At the end of January she collapsed and had her stomach 
removed.

Despite her ordeal, she urged others to consider having a gastric band fitted. ‘I have no regrets,’ she said.

‘The band is the best thing I have 
ever done. I don’t want people to be put off when what happened to me 
was a freak occurrence.’

Those who are mocked for being 
overweight are more likely to get fatter, according to a study by 
Florida State University – because fear of ridicule means they avoid 
exercise and are prone to comfort eating.

Meanwhile, scientists in Japan have 
developed a breath sensor that can accurately measure actual fat loss 
after exercise. Researcher Satoshi Hiyama said it could play ‘a pivotal 
role’ in the fight against obesity.
