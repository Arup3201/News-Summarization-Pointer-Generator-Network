An elite team of British medics in the Philippines typhoon disaster zone were yesterday launching a rescue mission to remote islands cut off from aid for nine days.

The 12-strong taskforce of specialist doctors, anaesthetists and nurses will set off as early as today to help isolated communities at the request of the Philippines government and the World Health Organisation.

They will be carrying two tons of medical equipment from the UK.

The development came as:

Donations by the British public to the Typhoon Haiyan charity appeal also reached £33 million yesterday. And David Cameron announced that the Government is to give an extra £30 million in aid to the Philippines, bringing the total to £50 million.

The Mail on Sunday joined the medical taskforce as it touched down on Cebu and travelled with leader Professor Tony Redmond and two of his colleagues to the northern tip of the island devastated by Typhoon Haiyan.

They drove through villages flattened by the storm and visited hospitals in Bogo City and Daanbantayan where storm casualties are being treated. Children held up pitiful signs begging for food and water along the route where, in some villages, 90 per cent of homes were ruined.

More than 100 people with sick children and relatives lined up outside the general hospital in Bogo City, now a field hospital treating storm victims with similar injuries to those the British team expects to find.

As well as storm injuries, the hospital has had to cope with a rash of premature births after traumatised women went into labour early.

Professor Redmond, who heads the University of Manchester’s Humanitarian Conflict Response Unit, said many of the injuries treated at the hospital were caused after tin roofs were blasted away in the storm.

The British team will try to help in remote areas which have had no medical aid since one of the fiercest typhoons ever. Prof Redmond said: ‘We will be assisting people who have untreated injuries and untreated illnesses who will need urgent help.

‘Any untreated wound will be infected and any untreated illness will be worse. We will give them what care we can and arrange for them to be airlifted or sent by ship to a hospital were they can be given appropriate treatment.’

Speaking as he gave his team their final briefings last night, Professor Redmond said: ‘The mood in the team is very positive. They have trained for this. This is what they want to do. They have seen the images and read the reports and they want to help.’

The mission is the first major test for an International Rescue-style network of doctors set up by the British Government last year called the UK International Emergency Trauma Register. It is funded by the Department for International Development.

It is part of a multi-million- pound relief effort by Britain which includes an airlift of emergency supplies and the deployment of destroyer HMS Daring – due to arrive in the Philippines today – and helicopter carrier HMS Illustrious to help deliver supplies.
