Keith Hartigan, 37, has been charged with first-degree rape

A property mogul is accused of raping a woman after she fell asleep at a luxury New York hotel.

Keith Hartigan, 37, allegedly attacked the 31-year-old at the Standard hotel on Friday.  

Hartigan, who sells property in the resort of Aspen, Colorado, was arrested at about 4.30am and has been charged with first-degree rape.

The New York Post said he met the woman after his friend cozied up to her at a trendy bar in the city.

She and his friend then joined Hartigan on the ninth floor of the hotel where rooms cost as much as $1,700 a night before falling asleep.

She claims to have been woken by the property mogul as he allegedly groped her, ripped off her underwear and then raped her.

The alleged victim then ran out of the room before calling 911 at the hotel reception, 'police sources' told The Post.

He was arrested and released after posting $7,500 bail.

The hotel, owned by tycoon Andre Balasz, in the Meatpacking District is famous for its floor to ceiling windows and views over the Hudson River.

Hartigan owns View West Properties, which sells luxury property in the exclusive ski resort of Aspen.

The company's Facebook page features a range of properties it has sold, including Jack Nicolson's house, and a picture of Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon dressed in ski wear as they rented one of the View West homes.

Hartigan and his lawyer declined to comment when contacted by The Post.
