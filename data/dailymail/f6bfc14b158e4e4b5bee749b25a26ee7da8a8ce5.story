Celtic defender Virgil van Dijk has been cleared to play in the QTS Scottish League Cup final after his Tannadice red card was rescinded.

The Dutchman was sent off in the first half of the William Hill Scottish Cup draw following a clash with Calum Butcher that resulted in himself and Dundee United midfielder Paul Paton being sent off.

Van Dijk will now be able to face United at Hampden on Sunday as well as in the quarter-final replay at Celtic Park three days later.

Paton also won his appeal, as expected, following the case of mistaken identity.

And United striker Nadir Ciftci was also cleared after being offered a two-match ban for allegedly kicking Celtic skipper Scott Brown in the head. The panel found the case 'not proven'.

It was the second week running that Ciftci faced a judicial panel, having successfully challenged a two-match ban following a clash with Inverness defender Gary Warren.

The forward will still miss the League Cup final after picking up his second booking of the competition in the semi-final win over Aberdeen, but will be free to play in the Parkhead Scottish Cup replay.
