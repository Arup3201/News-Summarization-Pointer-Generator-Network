Abbie Cornish said she found the rumours about her death 'dead scarey' (sic)

An Australian film star was forced to deny rumours that she had died after becoming the latest celebrity victim of an online death hoax.

Abbie Cornish, who appeared in Seven Psychopaths and the upcoming remake of RoboCop, said she woke up to find almost one million people had 'liked' a Facebook page called 'R.I.P Abbie Cornish'.

The actress wrote on her own page that she found the story 'dead scarey' (sic) and 'amazing', according to News.com

She is one of an illustrious list of celebrities who have had to deny their own death.

In 2010, Owen Wilson, Charlie Sheen, Adam Sandler and Eddie Murphy were all killed in cyber space.

All four supposedly died in snowboarding accidents.

On Tuesday, a fake death notice said Abbie Cornish had died the previous day and 'will be missed but not forgotten.'

A tribute page on Facebook has since been removed.

She wrote: 'Imagine waking up one morning, logging on to the world wide web and discovering that you are dead.

'At least that's what happened to one lady hailing from the Hunter this week.

'Someone certainly hadn't let her know for she got up and went about working on her next film.'

Her management team told Australian siteÂ News.com that fans should 'stop believing what you see on the internet'.

Cornish used to date actor Ryan Phillippe and appeared in Madonna's film about Wallis Simpson W.E.

Morgan Freeman and former popstar Aaron Carter have also been the subject of recent online death rumours.

Cornish, pictured with actor Ben Whishaw, who she starred with in Bright Star, said she woke up to find a Facebook tribute page had been set up

Jeff Goldblum's 'death' was read out on Australian news after rumours circulated on Facebook

In 2009, it was announced that Jurassic Park star Jeff Goldblum had died while filming in New Zealand.

It was even announced on Australian news programme Channel Nine's Today show but was later quashed when Kevin Spacey announced he was still alive on Twitter.

The actor wrote: 'Jeff Goldblum is alive and well. I just spoke to his manager. Stop these stupid rumors.'
