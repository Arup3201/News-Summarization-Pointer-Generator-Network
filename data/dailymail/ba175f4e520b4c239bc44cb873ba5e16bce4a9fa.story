Mark Darcy is dead? Noooo! Say it is not so. Not Mark. Not the dashing and dishy lawyer, hero of the Bridget Jones novels and the Hollywood films that followed?

He was the ultimate knight in shining armour — well, a cashmere coat and white shirt at least — the devoted hunk who rescues calamitous Bridget from myriad scrapes and japes, but most of all from herself.

Surely he cannot be dead and gone, ceased to be, expired and gone to meet his maker?

Dishy even in that jumper: Colin Firth as Mark Darcy

Well, I am afraid so. In Mad About The Boy, the brand new volume of Bridget Jones’s fictional diaries, author Helen Fielding reveals the terrible news. She has killed off her hero, stabbed him right between the pages without a second thought.

After all those years, after the regrettable but gluttonous consumption of too many calories, alcohol units and toxic bachelors, there was almost a happy ending for Bridget.

Following Darcy’s proposal at the end of the last book, The Edge Of Reason, we learn that the couple did go on to marry and have two children. Then tragedy struck. Marky has met his maker.

Extracts published in a Sunday newspaper reveal that Mad About The Boy begins five years after Darcy has died. We are reintroduced to Bridget as a  51-year-old widow (‘35 if anyone asks’), a mother to little Mabel and nit-infested Billy. Surprisingly, she appears to have overcome the mortal blow of her husband’s death — on the surface, at least.

The contemporary Bridget is a foxy yummy mummy, immersed in an affair with a 29-year-old toyboy called Roxster.

In one passage, Bridget gets lost in a moment of private reverie, recalling things she and Roxster did in the bathroom when her kids were asleep. I’m not giving anything away here when I reveal that it wasn’t synchronised tooth flossing.

More alarmingly, the new Bridget is also obsessed with social media, more likely to be found counting Twitter followers than calories.

How apt then that appalled Bridget Jones fans took to Twitter in their thousands over the weekend, tweeting in uproar when the demise of Darcy was revealed in The Sunday Times.

Their responses sparked across cyberspace like angry firecrackers. ‘I refuse to believe it’. ‘My whole world has just fallen apart.’ ‘Not OKAY.’ ‘Am devastated. Why, Helen Fielding? Why???’ ‘Mark Darcy is dead. Bridget Jones is a widow!! This is all too much!’

These were just some of the reactions as the news clattered across the world. It led TV news bulletins, it was discussed on chat boards, it landed with a crash on newspaper websites.

Readers and fans won’t know the cause of Darcy’s death, apparently buried deep in a flashback many chapters later, until the book is published next month. Until then, those who have become so upset by the news that the non-existent husband of a fictional character has been killed off will somehow have to contain their grief.

Why should the death of Darcy cause such a reaction? To understand, we have to turn the clock back to remember the crazy days when Bridget first burst onto the scene, an everywoman for single girls; the patron saint of drunken wallflowers whose careers were going nowhere fast.

Back in the mid-Nineties — shatteringly, it seems just like yesterday — Helen Fielding’s newspaper column Bridget Jones’s Diary first charted the life of a 30-something singleton trying to make her way in London.

Bridget quickly became one of the most beloved characters in modern literature. With every unit of alcohol and cigarette consumed, Fielding practically invented chick lit. No one before or since did it so well or so wittily.

In Mad About The Boy, the brand new volume of Bridget Jones's fictional diaries, author Helen Fielding reveals the terrible news...

The first book came out in 1996 and went on to become a smash, eventually voted one of the top ten novels that defined the 20th century — along with 1984 by George Orwell and Anne Frank’s Diary Of A Young Girl.

Published in 40 countries, it sold more than 15 million copies worldwide, and spawned a best-selling sequel, Bridget Jones: The Edge Of Reason. The two books were each turned into major films starring Renée Zellweger as Bridget, Colin Firth as Darcy and Hugh Grant as the despicable Daniel Cleaver.

Bridget’s appeal stretched across continents; her singular, hilarious voice was a comfort to the lonely and the lovelorn. And her relationship with Mark Darcy really mattered — it was the beating heart of the story. After all, he was the ultimate chick-lit romantic hero; tall, dark-haired, handsome, rich, clever, kindly and divorced by a Cruel First Wife, who left him emotionally bruised and Unable To Trust.

Only carefree, silly Bridget could make him happy again — and it was thrilling when he finally proposed. For millions of readers, if the world’s most famously socially dysfunctional singleton could find happiness at the end of the rainbow of dating and disasters, there was hope for us all. And now this? No wonder they are so upset.

Of course, author Helen Fielding has always claimed that her character Bridget Jones is not autobiographical. However, it is telling that Fielding wrote the first books when she was a singleton herself. And now, just like Bridget, she is a single mother of two.

There are other worrying signs. In the new book, Bridget still seems to be bumbling around in a disorganised mess, like a teen who won’t tidy her bedroom or her thoughts. Despite bereavement and motherhood, nothing fundamental seems to have changed in the pulsing, boy-mad walnut of her brain.

She is obsessed with her toy-boy lover and with texting and tweeting. She admonishes herself for ‘lying in bed thinking erotic thoughts’ and wanting to give the other mothers ‘the V sign’ at the school gates. Oh, stop it!

She also obsesses about ageing, as do the characters around her. This is supposed to be the voice of a middle-aged widow and mother of two?

Most women, I think, would accept that they are not the same person they were at 30 as they are at 50. Life has a way of buffering emotions, smoothing out some, sharpening others. What was so important 20 years ago seems almost irrelevant now.

Terrific: Bridget Jones was self-obsessed and silly and preoccupied about how she looked and the effect she was having on other people. It captured what it was like to be young, free and single, trying to make your mark on the world

That was what was so terrific about the younger Bridget. She was self-obsessed and silly and preoccupied about how she looked and the effect she was having on other people. It captured what it was like to be young, free and single, trying to make your mark on the world. Yet surely one has to move on?

From the glimpses we have seen so far, Bridget is a cheese who has plunged through the maturation process without touching the sides. She is still a ditz who cannot work the remote control of her television or stop herself from eating three big Macs a week, she continues to blunder around as if she fell out of Café Rouge half an hour ago.

Emotionally, mentally and physically, Bridget has failed to move on. Today, she is an analogue woman in a digital age, struggling to keep up with the kids. She is growing old disgracefully — should we cheer or weep?

Fielding’s publishers have said that the new book would ‘give a voice to the more mature social media-obsessed concerns of the women who grew up with Bridget’. Well, it might be true for a smattering of North London yum-mums, but I wonder how much resonance it will have elsewhere? Can we even be bothered with her angst any more?

Perhaps in some respects, Mark Darcy had to die. In so many ways, he was like Bridget’s parent; always getting her out of trouble, kissing it better, giving her advice and loving her unconditionally. If Mark was there, he would be telling her to grow up. And if she grew up, she wouldn’t be Bridget.
