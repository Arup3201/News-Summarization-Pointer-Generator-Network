Fall: George Michael was airlifted to hospital after tumbling out of his chauffeur-driven Range Rover on the M1 last month

George Michael will not face charges after tumbling from his chauffeur-driven Range Rover onto a busy motorway, police confirmed today.

The singer, 49, was airlifted to hospital after falling from the back seat of the car as it hurtled along in the fast lane of the northbound M1 at St Albans on May 16.

Michael - said to have fallen out accidentally as he tried to open and shut a passenger door that wasn't properly closed - gave a statement to police in the wake of the bizarre incident, and Hertfordshire Police today confirmed that no further action would be taken.

It is an offence for drivers or passengers not to wear a seatbelt where one is fitted.

A spokeswoman for the force told MailOnline: 'We're not taking any further action against anybody in the vehicle.'

George Michael's driver and another passenger travelling in the vehicle at the time were also spoken to by police about the incident.

Speculation was rife following the singer's fall last month, which saw motorway drivers forced to brake and swerve to avoid Michael as he fell onto the carriageway.

Eyewitnesses described seeing the musician bounce several times along the carriageway after hitting the tarmac.

Some reports suggested Michael had in fact thrown himself from the vehicle - a claim that was branded 'absurd' by friends of the pop star.

Representatives for the former Wham heart-throb said in a statement after the fall that Michael was being treated for cuts and bruises but was 'fine'.

While a statement on his website said his injuries were 'superficial', Michael spent almost two weeks in hospital before being discharged.

After the incident driver Katherine Fox, 23, from Dunstable in Bedfordshire, described how she was forced to slam on her brakes to avoid hitting the star as he fell out of the car, and said the 49-year-old was lucky to be alive.

Miss Fox said she reversed her mini to shield Michael from oncoming traffic following his fall, which she said left him covered in blood with his tracksuit top torn to shreds.

She said the singer looked 'terrible' as he lay on the third of four lanes on the busy stretch of motorway, adding: 'There was so much blood on his face that I didn't recognise him.'

Following his release from hospital on May 28 a statement on his website thanked fans for their messages of support.

'We can confirm that George Michael has been discharged from hospital and continues to rest and recuperate,' it said.
