When Salih Saruhan began suffering from a runny nose during his hairdressing training, he put it town to a cold.

He never dreamt it would be an allergy to the very thing he would work with every day - human hair.

The 21-year-old barber from Sheerness, Kent, gets itchy eyes and a bunged up nose whenever he cuts hair - and it gets worse the curlier the locks.

Despite his allergy, he refuses to change career, instead battling his symptoms with a nasal spray and two prescribed antihistamine tablets a day.

Salih Saruhan gets hay fever-like symptoms, including itchy eyes and a bunged up nose whenever he cuts hair

The problem started two years ago when Mr Saruhan gave up his labouring job and moved to London to re-train as a stylist.

Shortly into his training he started suffering hay fever-like symptoms - and baffled doctors eventually diagnosed an allergy to human hair.

It is thought the problem arises when he breathes in tiny particles of hair which float around the air after it has been cut.

Undeterred, and determined to finish the course, Mr Saruhan emerged with the highest grade the school has ever given out.

And despite the unusual allergy he cannot see himself doing any other job.

He said: 'I am lucky I really enjoy what I do so I am not going to let the sniffles stop me.

'I finally found something I like, but I ended up being allergic to it.

The Turkish barber thought he was suffering from a bad mid-winter cold when he began his training two years ago, before eventually being diagnosed with an allergy to human hair

'When the symptoms first started I thought it was a mid-winter cold, I had a blocked nose and my eyes were really itchy.

'I left the salon and my sinuses cleared up, my eyes gradually started to ease off.

'The doctor told me that it was really unusual for a person to have an allergic reaction to human hair as it is usually animal hair or fur which affects people.

'I've been prescribed different medicines and remedies but nothing really works.

'I just try to live with it.'

And it's curly locks that seem to be particularly troublesome.

'I will often have a really bad attack when I have been cutting curly hair. It is a bit of a nuisance but it doesn't affect the way I cut,' he added.

Mr Saruhan qualified as a bricklayer after studying the profession vocationally at school and college when he was 16.

He first discovered his allergy two years ago, when he enrolled on a 10-week intensive course in London.

During his training Mr Saruhan found he was allergic to the workplace, developing the sneezes and itchy eyes.

His teachers suggested he see a professional but he stumped doctors as they had never heard of someone being allergic to human hair before.

He assures customers his condition is not contagious and his nose does not drip, although he has to blow his nose every now and again to fight the symptoms.
