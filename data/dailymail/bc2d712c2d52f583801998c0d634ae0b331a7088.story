A stonemason has 'RIP-ossessed' a headstone worth nearly £10,000 after the bill remained unpaid for more than three years.

Self-employed stonemason Andy Manuell, 54, went to the extreme lengths of tearing down the memorial when he was left out of pocket after chasing the family for payment for the ‘star memorial’ in Durrington Cemetery, West Sussex.

Last month he partially dismantled the elaborate headstone for Francesco and Immacolata Isolda to try and ‘cause a reaction’ to motivate the family to pay up.

Grave decision: Stonemason Andy Manuell has removed the headstone after a £10,000 bill went unpaid by the family for three years

Due notice: The stonemason attached a warning to the grave three months ago, to no avail

Stone: The cost of the ornate memorial put Mr Manuell, an independent businessman, out of pocket

But his desperate act was ignored, forcing him to completely remove the elaborate 4ft high memorial.

Crafting it put him into the red and he was forced to pay debt collectors from his own savings.

Last month Mr Manuell, of Worthing, Sussex, said: 'I have been forced to pay out of my own savings to try and keep my business afloat.

'This was one of the biggest and most ornate graves I have ever made.

'£10,000 is a lot of money to be left out of pocket with when you're a small business.

'It would have been the star memorial in my brochure and it is easily the biggest in the cemetery.

'I had no reason to think they wouldn't pay me but the situation has turned into a nightmare.

'The family had bought another gravestone from me previously and I had confidence in them.’

Before and after: A colleague of Mr Manuell says the removal pricked the stonemason's conscience but he felt he had no choice

A notice was placed on the grave three months ago warning that it could be taken away. Mr Manuell hoped the notice would shock the family into action but the bill remains unpaid.

Last month a man claiming to be the daughter's partner at her address said the family had offered to pay and they could prove it, but nothing happened.

Colleague Chris Groom, speaking last month as the headstone was being partially dismantled, said: 'I think Andy does feel guilty about this but he has given them every opportunity that he possibly could to pay.

'Andy is a really nice guy and he has given them so much time to actually deal with this.'
