Teacher: Romany Blythe, of Worthing in East Sussex, called Lady Thatcher a despot and said: 'They danced in the streets when Hitler died, too'

The drama teacher who encourage thousands to attend vile Thatcher ‘death parties’ compared the baroness to Adolf Hitler yesterday.

Romany Blythe called Lady Thatcher a despot and said: ‘They danced in the streets when Hitler died, too’.

The 45-year-old – who was given breast implants on the NHS because she complained of low self-esteem – had sparked outrage by creating an internet page called: ‘The witch is dead.’

On it she urged more than 5,000 people to attend a death party in central London on Monday.

Miss Blythe, who specialises in teaching troubled children, wrote of Lady Thatcher: ‘Who wants to p*** on her grave?’

Despite the furore caused by her actions, the teacher from Worthing in East Sussex was unrepentant yesterday. ‘People say you shouldn’t speak ill of the dead – but it depends who the dead person is,’ she said. ‘We just don’t want to whitewash what happened when she was prime minister.

‘In normal circumstances celebrating someone’s death would be reprehensible. But we are Generation X, upset people that left school to find hopelessness and despair.

‘She was a despot. They danced in the streets when Hitler died too. Mrs Thatcher was friends with Pinochet. She chose her friends very wisely.’

Miss Blythe attempted to defend her behaviour by claiming she was ‘the voice of reason’.

‘I didn’t do the rioting – I just organised a Facebook page. I’m actually the voice of reason. I didn’t fan the flames. It was a way for us to come together and create unity and solidarity.

Breast implants: Teacher Miss Blythe is a member of a workshop company which visits secondary schools

'There was no other time we could come together as a group and recognise what had happened to us. It was about politics, not about hatred.’

Miss Blythe is a member of a workshop company which visits secondary schools.

Yesterday morning, after a risqué picture of her appeared in the Daily Mail, she appeared to be revelling in her notoriety, claiming: ‘The more publicity the bigger the party. I look good in a corset. I know I make Katie Price look like a saint.’

But by the afternoon, amid a growing public backlash over her behaviour, she appeared to have had a change of heart. She closed her Twitter account and increased the privacy settings on her Facebook page.

Miss Blythe was given the now-banned PIP breast implants on the NHS in 2000 after suffering from low esteem for years. 

She has told her local paper that the chemicals in the implants may have caused her to have a miscarriage.

At Ed Miliband’s old school, parents and staff spoke of their disgust after learning that one of their teachers organised a Thatcher ‘death party’.

Craig Parr, a special needs teacher at 
Haverstock School – nicknamed ‘Labour’s Eton’ – was pictured parading 
with a placard which read: ‘Rejoice: Thatcher is Dead.’

The 27-year-old union activist led chants of ‘Maggie. Maggie, Maggie, dead, dead, dead’ at a death party he organised in Brixton, south London, on Monday night which ended in violent scenes.

Jo Sattaur, director of finance operations at the school, said: ‘I hope our pupils do not see the news and think it is okay to join in with these protests. It doesn’t represent our school, nor is it accepted here.’

Mr Parr resigned from his post in February, but is still officially employed by the school until the end of the month.
