'I want to win titles with Chelsea and we have an opportunity this season,' he told The Sun.

'I need to take the experience of this summer and make the next step at Chelsea, to step up and play a big role this season with the confidence I have.

'Right now, I feel so confident. I’m tired but feeling better and better.

'It would be impossible for me to be fit after only one week of training with the squad but playing two matches at the weekend has been good for me.'
