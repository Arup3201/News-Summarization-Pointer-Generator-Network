Barcelona's crushing 6-1 win against Rayo Vallecano may have sent Barcelona to the La Liga summit on Sunday, but defender Gerard Pique isn't get too carried away just yet.

The defender, who found the goal himself in the Nou Camp mauling, was quick to warn his fellow teammates of complacency as the Catalans overtook Real Madrid at the top.

A hat-trick from Lionel Messi and a double from Luis Suarez helped Barcelona capitalise on Real Madrid's defeat on Saturday, but Pique knows there is still a long way to go yet.

He said: 'We're top, but the league is very long. Being leaders doesn't mean we've won anything. It's the result of a long road which we hope won't come to an end yet.

'We started well, we had a break, but now we're back and we're fine. Now we're in good form. That's more important at the moment than being top.

'I'm sure we'll drop some more points during the rest of the season, but we must try to make sure we lose less and are top at the end of the season.'Â
