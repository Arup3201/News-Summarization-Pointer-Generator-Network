Three women who have lost 32 stone between them after overcoming bullying, low self esteem and even sexual abuse, have shared their inspiring stories.

Nicky Pengelly, 46, from Suffolk, had gained weight after suffering years of abuse from her mother's partner and then married a violent man.

In a bid to make herself less attractive to men, Nicky overate so her weigh rose to 21st 7lbs at her heaviest.

Comfort eating: Nicky found solace in food after being abused as a child and then being trapped in a violent marriage

Found happiness: She shows off her new 10st 1lb figure after dropping 11st after re-marrying

The horrific abuse began when Nicky was just 12-years-old at the hands of her mother's partner and affected both her view of men and attitude towards food.

She explained: 'It
 happened repeatedly over two years and I felt dirty and disgusted. I 
thought if I gained weight, they wouldn't find me attractive and 
wouldn't do anything to me.'

Nicky thought her luck had changed when she met her first husband at the age of 17. However this security didn't last long and he soon became physically abusive.

Despite
 being advised by the police to leave him, she wanted the relationship 
to work. It wasn't until he pushed her down the stairs whilst pregnant 
with their child Sean, now 28, that she made the decision to escape.

Throughout the abuse Nicky found solace in food, and would binge on chocolate bars and crisps in an attempt to comfort herself.

Nicky eventually found true love with David, who she married in 1987, and has been her rock ever since.

She said: 'He saw past my size 24 figure and we went on to have a little girl of our own, Morweena, now 22.' 

As she was: Melissa, who has won a Young Slimmer of the Year award, was severely bullied about her weight

Despite her new found happiness, Nicky's eating habits were out of control, and, pushing 21 stone, she could only find clothes to fit her on trips to the U.S.

In 2003 when she started training as a nurse, even the XXL uniform wouldn't fit her and she had to have them specially made - which left her feeling mortified.

When
 she started working full time as a district nurse promoting healthy 
eating, one comment from a patient had a lasting effect on her. They had stated: 'You tell me to eat fish, not chocolate, but you seem to get bigger every time I see you.'

Nicky knew she had to practice what she preached so decided to join her local Rosemary Conley club in a bid to shift the pounds.

She
 said: 'Our instructor was so enthusiastic and I soon realised that my 
Rosemary Conley class offered the support I never had as a child, which 
spurred me on even more.'

As a result of her new eating regime and taking up exercise - including taking part in a Race For Life 5k run - she lost 10st 1lb.

Due to her incredible weighloss, she has been named the Health Professional of the Year at the National Slimmer of the Year Awards, winning a £1000 prize presented by Rosemary Conley CBE at a glittering awards ceremony.

Another slimmer who will pick up an award is Melissa Bridge, 23, from Tamworth, also overcame the psychological demons that had caused her to comfort eat. She has been named the Young Slimmer of the Year after dropping 11st.

Melissa had struggled with her weight from an early age and suffered bullying at school as a result.

'It feels brilliant': Melissa has dropped to 10st 5lb and now wears a dress size 10

When she was six, she suffered with joint pain and had arthritis in the knee, which made running around at school and joining in with games difficult.

As she became more overweight, her school uniform had to be specially made for her, fuelling cruel taunts from her classmates.

By the time she was 13, Melissa had to leave school to be taught at home as she couldn't cope with normal day-to-day life.

Melissa felt trapped in a vicious circle; the fatter she became the more she ate to try and comfort herself.

'I couldn't break the cycle and I was getting bigger and bigger by the day,' she said.

In September 2011 Melissa suffered a suspected stroke which resulted in her spending her 21st birthday waiting for an MRI scan, rather than enjoying her special day.

'I think it was a warning, it was like my body was shutting down,' she said.

After her health scare, and making the devastating discovery that her long-term boyfriend had been cheating on her, Melissa decided to action about her weight.

Weighing in at 21st 13lb and at size 28, her weight yo-yoed until she found support from fellow dieters at her local Rosemary Conley classes.

With diet and excerise she has dropped to 10st 5lb and now wears a dress size 10.

She revealed: 'It feels brilliant to be able to dress the way every woman in her 20s wants to dress - I can even fit into a size 8 in some clothes which I still have trouble believing!'

The final winner at this years awards 
is Student Slimmer of the Year, Sophie Whelpton, 30, from Ipswich, who 
decided to lose weight when her confidence plummeted at university. 

During her time working in a call centre as a teenager, Sophie piled on the pounds snacking on sugary drinks and treats from the vending machines. 

At her peak she weighed more than
 21st but with the support of her mother, has managed to lose 10 st in 
two years, dropping from 21st 10lb and dress size 26/28, to 10st 10lb 
dress size 10/12.
