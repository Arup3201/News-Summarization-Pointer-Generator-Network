At least 156 people have been killed and thousands more left injured after a powerful earthquake jolted China's Sichuan province near the same area where a devastating quake struck five years ago.

More than 5,500 people are reported to have been injured in the earthquake which struck mountainous Lushan county shortly after 8am this morning local time, and 19 people have been reported missing in the wake of the tremor.

The earthquake, while not as destructive as the one in 2008, toppled buildings, triggered landslides and disrupted phone and power connections in the region.

The village of Longmen was hit 
particularly hard, with authorities saying nearly all the buildings 
there had been destroyed by the terrifying minute-long tremor.

The China Earthquake Administration said at least 156 people had died, 
including 96 in Lushan. In the jurisdiction of Ya'an, which administers 
Lushan, 19 people were reported missing and more than 5,500 people were 
injured, the administration said.

'It was such a big quake that everyone 
was scared,' said a woman who answered the phone at a kindergarten hours
 later and declined to give her name. 'We all fled for our lives.'

Emergency workers turned the square outside the Lushan County Hospital into a 
triage center, where medical personnel bandaged bleeding victims, 
according to footage on China Central Television.

Rescuers used dynamite to clear 
boulders that had fallen across roads to reach Longmen and other damaged
 areas lying farther up the mountain valleys, state media reported.

The quake - measured by the earthquake administration at magnitude-7.0 
and by the U.S. Geological Survey at 6.6 - struck the steep hills of 
Lushan county shortly after 8 a.m., when many people were at home, 
sleeping or having breakfast.

People in their underwear and wrapped in 
blankets ran into the streets of Ya'an and even the provincial capital 
of Chengdu, 70 miles east of Lushan, according to 
photos, video and accounts posted online.

The quake's shallow depth, less than 8 miles, is likely to have magnified its impact.Â 

Chengdu's airport shut down for about an hour before reopening, though 
many flights were cancelled or delayed, and its railway station halted 
dozens of scheduled train rides Saturday, state media said.

Lushan reported the most deaths, but there was concern that casualties 
in neighboring Baoxing county might have been under-reported because of 
inaccessibility after roads were blocked and power and phone services 
cut off.

As the region went into the first night after the quake, rain started to
 fall, slowing rescue work.

Forecasts are pointing to more rain over the coming days, and the China Meteorological Administration warned of 
possible landslides and other geological disasters.

Tens of thousands of people moved into tents or cars, unable to return 
home or too afraid to go back as aftershocks continued to jolt the 
region.

Lushan, where the quake struck, lies where the fertile Sichuan plain 
meets foothills that eventually rise to the Tibetan plateau and sits 
atop the Longmenshan fault. It was along that fault line that a 
devastating magnitude-7.9 quake struck on May 12, 2008, leaving more 
than 90,000 people dead or missing and presumed dead in one of the worst
 natural disasters to strike China in recent decades.

'It was just like May 12,' Liu Xi, a writer in Ya'an city, who was 
jolted awake by today's quake, said via a private message on his 
account on Sina Corporation's Twitter-like Weibo service. 'All the home 
decorations fell at once, and the old house cracked.'

The official Xinhua News Agency said the well-known Bifengxia panda 
preserve, which is near Lushan, was not affected by the quake. Dozens of
 pandas were moved to Bifengxia from another preserve, Wolong, after its
 habitat was wrecked by the 2008 quake.

As in most natural disasters, the government mobilized thousands of 
soldiers and others - 7,000 people by this afternoon - sending 
excavators and other heavy machinery as well as tents, blankets and 
other emergency supplies.

Two soldiers died after the vehicle that they 
and more than a dozen others were in slipped off the road and rolled 
down a cliff, state media reported.

Premier Li Keqiang flew to Ya'an to direct rescue efforts, and he and 
President Xi Jinping ordered officials and rescuers to make saving 
people the top priority, Xinhua said.

The Chinese Red Cross said it had deployed relief teams with supplies of
 food, water, medicine and rescue equipment to the disaster areas.

With roads blocked for several hours after the quake, the military 
surveyed the disaster area by air.

Aerial photos released by the 
military and shown on state television showed individual houses in ruins
 in Lushan and outlying villages flattened into rubble. The roofs of 
some taller buildings appeared to have slipped off, exposing the floors 
beneath them.

A person whose posts to the micro-blogging account 'Qingyi Riverside' on
 Weibo carried a locator geotag for Lushan said many buildings collapsed
 and that people could spot helicopters hovering above.

The earthquake administration said there had been at least 712 aftershocks, including two of magnitude-5.0 or higher.

'It's too dangerous,' said a person with the Weibo account 
Chengduxinglin and with a Lushan geotag. 'Even the aftershocks are 
scary.'

While rescuers and state media rushed to the disaster scene, China's 
active social media users filled the information gap. They posted photos
 of people fleeing to streets for safety and of buildings flattened by 
the quake.

They shared information on the availability of phone 
services, apparently through data services.
