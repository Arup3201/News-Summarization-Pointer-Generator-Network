Police in Northern California say the mother of a 3-year-old girl who was found dead in her bed and the mother's boyfriend are wanted for questioning in a case that has been classified as a homicide.

Napa Police Department Lt. Debbie Peecook said officers have unable to find 23-year-old Sara Krueger and her boyfriend, 26-year-old Scott Warner, since the body of Krueger's daughter was discovered on Saturday afternoon.

Peecook says the girl, whom police have not named, showed signs of having been sexually assaulted and blunt force trauma.

Wanted: Sarah Krueger was last seen Saturday - the same day her 3-year-old daughter was found murdered

Bad boy: Krueger was last seen with her boyfriend, 26-year-old Scott Warner

The victim would have turned 4 in May.

Neighbors reported seeing the couple carrying luggage away from the apartment complex where Krueger and the girl lived earlier Saturday.

Elizabeth Cherchourka, who manages the complex, told Oakland television station KTVU that she often saw the girl riding a bicycle and that she appeared well cared-for.

Krueger is described as a 23-year-old white woman, stands 5-foot-4 and weighs 160 pounds. She has brown hair and hazel eyes, police said.
