This is the terrifying moment two carriages on an amusement ride at Cardiff's Winter Wonderland collided while spinning almost 200ft up in the air.

Footage of the heart-stopping moment when the two carriages hit each other was captured by spectators filming the ride at ground level.

The attraction, called the Sky Swing, can be seen spinning in circles as expected, before a gust of wind appears to begin heaving two carriages towards each other.

They eventually collide, after which the ride is abruptly stopped.

After initially joking about how close together some of the carriages were swinging, those filming the incident reacted with shock when they witnessed the collision.

One said: 'It looks like its going to hit her. See that? It him them.'

His friend then responds: 'Oh my God it's hit them. They've stopped the ride.'

The video was posted on Facebook by a woman named Leanne Williams, who offered a stark warning to those visiting the attraction.

The carriage was seen swinging wildly moments before it collided with people sat in a separate carriage

After the close encounter, the ride stopped spinning and the carriages were dropped to the ground

She wrote: 'Just a warning to any one who goes to Winter Wonderland (Cardiff) be aware of this ride.

'Watch and see what happens. Scariest moment of my life.'

Onlookers said operators of the giant Sky Swing ride were making sure every carriage was filled today to avoid a repeat of the collisions which terrified passengers 200ft above the ground.

Passengers who paid £5 each to enjoy the ride waited for as long as 20 mins before each of the two-seater carriages had someone sitting in them.

If there were not enough paying passengers then workers sat in an empty carriage to stop it swinging wildly in the strong winds.

Many of the passengers, who have to be over 1.22m tall to get on the ride, did not know there had been an incident just a few days earlier.

David Williams, 36, said after taking the ride: 'I didn't know there had been a crash. It's a bit worrying to be honest, but you have to trust they are safe.

'Everyone seemed to be having a good time - there was lots of shrieking.

'I'm sure there is a lot of health and safety but I'm not sure I would have gone on with my nine-year-old son if I had known.'

Some riders had watched the heart-stopping video of the carriage collision before paying for their turn.

Iestyn Thomas, 18, said: 'I saw it on Facebook and my mate bet me I wouldn't go on it.

'It was fine but we had to wait a while until all the seats were full.

'I made my mate come on it with me and he was more scared.'

The BBC reported that the company which operates the Sky Ride, Sayers Amusements, had been asked to comment.
