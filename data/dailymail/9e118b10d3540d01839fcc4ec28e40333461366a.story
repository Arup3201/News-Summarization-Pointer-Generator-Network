The number of homes selling for more than £2million has soared by 10 times in less than two decades, official figures show.

As the political row rages of Labour's plan to impose a mansion tax on Britain's richest properties, a new heat map reveals how the vast majority of those hit by the levy are in London.

But with fewer than 2,500 homes selling for more than £2million last year, there are doubts about how much Ed Miliband's policy will raise.

Land Registry data shows how in 1995 just 27 houses sold for more than £2million, rising to 417 at the turn of the century and hitting 1,518 in 2010.

By 2013 there were 2,490 properties which smashed the £2million mark. A map produced by Lettingstats, part of Lettingweb.com shows where all the sales have been in the last 18 years, and how the vast majority are in London.

It also reveals how rising property prices have spread out of the capital, reaching parts of the Home Counties, the Westcountry and the North West.

Dan Cookson, head of research at Lettingstats, said: 'With all this talk of Mansion taxes the number one question on my lips was where are all these mansions?

'Our animated Mansiontaxmap clearly shows how London has been the key market for the £2m property over the last 18 years.

Over time though the once very rare £2million-plus sale has become more common.

'There were still only 2,490 of them in England & Wales during 2013 versus almost 10,884 £1million-plus sales.

'And they can now be seen in the super high end markets of Poole, Hale near Manchester popular with footballers, and the Cornish and Dorset resorts.

'The exclusive golf centred developments at Wentworth, Royal St Georges are clearly visible as is Cobham home to the Chelsea training ground as well as some of its players.'

Under Labour's plans the mansion tax will cost about £250 a month for someone in a home worth between £2million and £3million.

It is estimated that 108,000 homes – the vast majority in London and the South East – will be caught by the tax.

Mr Miliband's mansion tax plans came under fire from former pop singer Myleene Klass this week when she criticised the plan on television.

The former Hear'Say singer took the Labour leader to task in a heated TV debate and viewers praised her for 'doing a Paxman' and 'wiping the floor' with him.

She told Mr Miliband: 'For me, it's so disturbing – the name in its own right: 'mansion tax'.

'Immediately you conjure up an image of these Barbie-esque houses, but in London, which is where 80 per cent of the people who will be paying this tax actually live, have you seen what that amount of money can get you? It's like a garage.

'When you do look at the people who will be suffering this tax, it's true a lot of them are grannies who have had these houses in their families for a long, long time.'

Ed Miliband was left humiliated on Monday night after he was unceremoniously taken to task by Miss Klass over Labour’s proposed mansion tax on homes worth more than £2million

In the Commons today David Cameron mocked Mr Miliband for getting a public 'pasting' from Miss Klass.

The Labour leader challenged the Prime Minister to back the policy at their weekly Commons face-off, complaining that the owner of a £140 million property in Hyde Park would be paying the same as someone whose home was worth 'a fraction of that value'.

But Mr Cameron took the opportunity to raise Mr Miliband's bruising encounter with the model and HearSay singer this week, saying she had 'wiped the floor' with him.

Mr Cameron said the Government had 'made sure that the richest in our country have made a contribution by putting up stamp duty'.

'But the point about this is what we need is a growing economy that is providing the jobs, the livelihoods for our people,' he said.

'That is what we are getting. Whereas what he has had in the past week is a pasting from a pop star.'

He returned to the subject later in the exchanges, joking: 'This was the week when Myleene Klass wiped the floor with him in a television programme and this was the week when an opinion poll in Scotland showed that more people believe in the Loch Ness monster than believe in his leadership.

'The only problem for the Labour party is he does actually exist.'

However, Mr Miliband did receive support from Mr Cameron's coalition partner, Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg.

Pointing out that all homes worth more than £700,000 currently pay the same council tax, the Deputy Prime Minister told LBC radio his party had long wanted to introduce a mansion tax and Klass was 'wrong'.

'She also suggested that all you can buy in London was a garage for £2 million. That's some garage,' he said. 'Let's get rid of the emotion about calling it, claiming that one person's normal home is a mansion.

'Why don't we treat higher value properties in the same banded way of putting council tax bands as we do on lower value properties?

'What is possibly fair about saying to a family who live in a family home in Lewisham that they pay the same council tax as an oligarch who lives in a £13m house?'
