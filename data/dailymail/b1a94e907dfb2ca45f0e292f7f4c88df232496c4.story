The flamboyant Jason Brock's departure was overshadowed tonight by canny Simon Cowell's decision to reveal the contestants rankings for the first time.

It came as a surprise - especially to the frontrunner himself - to hear that the audience favourite is 37-year-old road worker Tate Stevens.

Scroll down to watch Jason and CeCe sing for survival...

Shock: The X Factor revealed that America gave Tate Stevens the most votes this week, it came as a surprise to the stetson sporting 37-year-old road worker

The cowboy-hat wearing singer pulled in more votes from viewers than any of the other, younger, contestants.

On learning the news he joked: 'Wow, obviously people in America don't get out a lot! Thank you so very much. This is huge.'

But another thirty-something was not so admired, and Jason, 35, was forced to say goodbye. 

'I did for the gays and Japan!' Jason was gracious in defeat after his lovely version of Bonnie Tyler's Total Eclipse of the Heart

He was forced into a sing off against fellow contestant CeCe Frey for the final spot in the top 12 of the show.

But
when the judges couldn't decide who to send home, it was revealed that 
because Jason had got the fewest votes from TV viewers, he wouldn't be 
going any further.

For the first time ever viewers got to see who were the most, and least popular, acts as their rankings were revealed following the public vote.

Forever's not going to start tonight: Not in terms of Jason's career

Singing for survival: But it didn't count as CeCe was saved by the public vote... just

The show opened with a bang - and the screams of dozens of female fans in the audience - as British boyband One Direction performed new single, Live While We're Young.

'How hot is One Direction?' asked Khloe Kardashian Odom as she touched both Liam and Zayn.

The previous night judge Simon Cowell pulled a stunning U-turn when he brought back teenager Diamond White, who had already been kicked off the show.

That left 13 finalists instead of the usual 12.

Big night: The judges got unprecedented feedback by learning the position of their acts in America's esteem

Surprise: Tate could barely take in the news that he'd garnered the most votes

Loyal: L.A stuck by his 'entertainer' Jason after he received the least votes

No.2: Carly Rose Soneclar was tonight's runner up

Khloe Kardashian added: 'There was a whole lot of drama on stage last night.'

Britney Spears, wearing a shimmery silver top that exposed her midriff and back, then walked onstage with her Teens category - Arin Ray, Beatrice Miller, Diamond White and Carly Rose Sonenclar.

Demi Lovato, in a flowery skirt that showed off her toned legs, then appeared with the acts she has been mentoring - the young adults, CeCe Frey, Jennel Garcia and Paige Thomas.

LA Reid, in a smart suit, then walked on with his over-25s acts - Jason Brock, Tate Stevens and Vino Alan.

And finally Simon Cowell, wearing a trademark sweater and jeans, appeared with the Groups - Emblem3, Fifth Harmony and Lyric145.

Looking the part: CeCe is the image of a pop star but she's still proving unpopular

Safe... for now: CeCe sobbed as she realised she was staying in the competition

A night of two halves: Simon enjoyed watching his UK find One Direction sing to screaming hordes but was shocked that Emblem3 ranked so low

Mario Lopez said: 'We're going to reveal who's made it through to the top 12. They will ALL be back next week. Good luck!'

He added: 'By the way, these results are in no particular order. Safe and through to the top 12 is… "'

Arin Ray, Paige Thomas, Diamond White, Vino Alan, Jennel Garcia and Emblem3 were all put out of their misery quickly and told they were here to stay. 

1. Tate Stevens

2. Carly Rose Sonenclar

3. Vino Alan

4. Diamond White

5. Fifth Harmony

6. Emblem3

7. Jennel Garcia

8. Paige Thomas

9. Lyric145

10. Beatrice Miller 

11. Arin Ray 

12. CeCe Frey

Carly Rose Sonenclar clasped her hands to her face as she found out she will be going straight through.

Also getting the good news were Tate Stevens, and Beatrice Miller - meaning all four of Britney's acts were voted into the next round. Beatrice hugged Britney at the news.

Also through was Lyric145, leaving CeCeFrey, Jason Brock and Fifth Harmony to battle it out for the final guaranteed spot.

Mario Lopez then said: 'The next act through to the top 12 is Fifth Harmony!'

The bottom two acts - CeCe and Jason - were then told they would have to sing before the judges decided who would be leaving the contest for good.

As she introduced her back on stage, Demi added: 'Please welcome the amazing, and talented and very beautiful CeCe Frey.'

The hopeful, dressed in Madonna-esque cream trousers and a cream top that showed off her arms, then belted out Cher's You Haven't Seen the Last of Me, which featured on the soundtrack of 2010 movie Burlesque.

After another ad break Jason Brock took to the stage to sing for survival.

He performed a stripped-down version of Total Eclipse of the Heart as he made a last-gasp bid to win over the judges.

The two acts then appeared on stage as Lopez explained how the judges would vote in turn on who they wanted to send home. If there was a deadlock the act with the lowest number of original viewer votes would be the one to get the axe.

Time to rethink: Simon says he will possibly be restyling Emblem3

Relief: We haven't seen the end of Fifth Harmony yet, and Simon is pleased about it

Through! Britney hugs Beatrice Miller in joy

As the tense announcements began, Demi Lovato was the first to send home Jason Brock, to boos form the audience.

LA Reid said: 'I'm sorry, I'm going to have to send CeCe home.'

Britney Spears also revealed she would be sending home CeCe, but Simon opted for Jason.

That meant the two acts were tied with two strikes each - leaving the decision in the hands of the audience who originally cast their votes.

Mario Lopez said: 'This truly is up to America.'

Keeping her girl: Demi didn't have to say goodbye to CeCe

No need to say goodbye: Paige Thomas is through but wasn't as high up in the ranks as Demi thought she should... or would be

Nine lives: Diamond White was brought back last night after her shock elimination, and she's No.4 with fans

Opening an envelope with the results on it, he added: 'The act with the lowest number of votes and who is going home tonight is Jason Brock.'

Jason appeared to be holding it together as he said: 'I want to say, I did it for the gays, and for Japan. But I'm really happy to have been here.'

Mentor LA Reid said: "I'm still proud of him, every time he sings. It really does make me sad to see you go. Keep doing it."

'I will keep singing,' Jason vowed.

At the end of the show it was revealed who got the most votes, in what was claimed to be a first for American reality TV.
