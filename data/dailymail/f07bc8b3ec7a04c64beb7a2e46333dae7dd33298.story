A British teenager has been arrested for sparking a bomb alert on the Las Vegas strip.

The 17-year-old from Sutton, south London called UK police on Monday claiming that there was a bomb underneath a taxi outside the MGM Grand casino.

Scotland Yard passed the warning to American police, who went to search the site.

The teenager called British police saying a bomb was underneath a taxi outside the MGM Casino in Las Vegas

An hour later he was picked up by British officers who traced the nuisance caller in London and arrested him.

The teenager has been released on bail until later this month. 

Las Vegas, home to world-renowned hotels and casinos, attracted nearly 40 million visitors last year and gambling venues on the strip brought in 6.5 billion US dollars in gaming revenue.

The MGM Grand, one of several internationally famous hotels on the strip, has just over 5,000 rooms and hosts events including major boxing matches and musical performances. 

He was traced to an address in Sutton, south London where he was arrested and later released on bail
