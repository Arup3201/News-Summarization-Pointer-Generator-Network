It was recovered yesterday after 70 years lying on the bottom of the English Channel, but the German Dornier 17 rescued from its watery grave was originally shot down at the height of the Battle of Britain.

The aircraft, which historians believe is the only remaining example of the 'flying pencil', was raised from the sea bed in the biggest salvage operation of its kind in British waters.

But the bomber was originally part of a large enemy formation which was intercepted by RAF fighter aircraft on August 26, 1940, as they attempted to attack airfields in Essex.

The plane was forced to make a 
belly-up emergency landing on the Goodwin Sands, in Kent, at low tide 
following a firefight in the skies above which left crew wounded and 
both engines damaged.

Attempting a wheels-up landing, Feldwebel (Flt Sgt) Willi Effmert managed to touch down safely and the aircraft sank inverted.

While Effmert and his observer were captured the other crewmen died and their bodies were later washed ashore.

A
notable aspect of the battle was the enormous bravery of the RAF Boulton Paul 
Defiant fighter pilots, who took on the Dornier 17 in outdated planes 
which had already suffered many losses in the early stages of the Battle
of Britain.

The two-seater planes, which had space for a rear gunner, were considered obsolete by the time the Battle of Britain was in full swing and the type was eventually withdrawn from front-line fighter duties to be converted to a night fighter role and later a drone tug.

The Do 17 was one of the principal bombers used by the Luftwaffe in the early years of the war, including during the Blitz.

It was part of a combined formation of Dorniers sent to bomb Debden and Hornchurch airfields before the battle in August 1940.

Rising
leviathan: The Dornier 17 aircraft is lifted from waters of the English
Channel. It was shot down during the 'Battle of Britain' in 1940 by RAF
Boulton-Paul Defiant fighters. Two of its four-man Luftwaffe crew were 
killed as it crashed into the sea, but the other two were captured by 
the British and became prisoners of war

Artefact:
The team watches as the aircraft is painstakingly lifted out of the 
sea. Aviation enthusiasts are excited because the bomber is in 
'remarkable condition'

Success:
Earlier attempts to raise the craft from the sea bed were thwarted by 
high winds but the project finally came to fruition today. Some parts of
the aircraft fell into the seas as it was being raised, but the RAF 
Museum tweeted that these parts will be recovered by divers. The wings 
and engines are intact, amazingly

Recovery:
Workers secure the remains of the crashed Dornier , the only surviving 
one of its type. It is known as the 'pencil bomber' because of its 
extremely thin fuselage

It is believed seven aircraft started to bomb an aerodrome, thought to be Debden, causing some damage. However, accounts of the aircraft's loss vary between sources.

Since the recovery yesterday, the wings and the fuselage of the aircraft have been sympathetically detached as the aircraft lies on the barge which is waiting to come into Ramsgate Harbour today.

Once the plane lands in the harbour it will be wrapped in a 'gel-like' substance to prevent further oxidisation and will then be placed upon three wide-load lorries to be taken up to Cosford this afternoon.

Paul Hudson, head of marketing at the RAF Museum London, said once at Cosford, the aircraft will be placed into hydration tunnels and it will be sprayed with a light citric solution to gently wash the aircraft of the salts that have accumulated over the last 70 years.

He said: 'During this process, the aircraft will be on view to the public and that should happen this weekend.

'It will undergo this process for three to five years at Cosford after which we will probably spend another year to a year-and-a-half prepping the aircraft to ensure it doesn't suffer any further corrosion and the intention is that it will eventually go on display at our London site opposite the wrecked Hawker Hurricane that we have here that was recovered from the Battle of Britain.'

According to the original PoW Interrogation Report, the Do 17 became separated from the rest of the formation while flying above clouds before reaching its target.

It was then attacked by fighters, believed to be one of the recently arrived RAF Hornchurch, Essex-based Boulton Paul Defiants of No.264 Squadron RAF led by Flt Lt Banham.

The attack is thought to have hit both engines and the cockpit. Reports suggest the Defiants brought down between one and six Dorniers in the fight, while losing three of their number.

Of the four crew of the Do 17, two became Prisoners-of-War in Canada - wounded Pilot Feldwebel Willi Effmert and Bomb Aimer Uffz Hermann Ritzel - and two were killed - 27-year old Wireless Operator Unteroffizier Helmut Reinhardt and 21-year old Bomb aimer Gefreiter Heinz Huhn.

Their bodies were recovered later and buried in Holland and the UK, in the Cannock Chase German cemetery, respectively.

The recovery of the aircraft from the
seabed is a £600,000 project by the RAF Museum in North London. Its 
team were able to raise the aircraft  by placing metal cables around the
strongest part of the frame and lifting it whole.

Experts at the museum say the plane, found on Goodwin Sands by divers in 2008, 
is in 'remarkable condition', particularly considering the events 
surrounding its downfall and the effects of spending so much time under 
water.

Peter Dye, of the RAF Museum, said: ‘The
discovery and recovery of the Dornier is of national and international 
importance. The aircraft is a unique and unprecedented survivor from the
Battle of Britain and the Blitz..

'It will provide an evocative and 
moving exhibit that will allow the museum to present the wider story of 
the Battle of Britain and highlight the sacrifices made by the young men
of both air forces. It is a project that has reconciliation and 
remembrance at its heart.'

Apart
from being covered with barnacles and teeming with marine life, the 
Dornier is largely intact. The undercarriage tyres remain inflated 
although the propellers were damaged when the aircraft crashed.

Sonar scans by the RAF Museum, Wessex Archaeology and the Port of London Authority confirmed its identity.

The recovery was backed by a National Heritage Memorial Fund grant of £345,000.

A
two-year restoration will take place at the RAF Museum’s site in 
Cosford, Shropshire, and it will later go on display at the RAF Museum 
in Hendon, North London.

The
plane will eventually be restored and go on display as an 'evocative 
and moving' reminder of the young men of both sides who lost their lives
in the battle for air supremacy in 1940.

In the air once more: Despite the nearly 73 years it has lain on the sea floor, the German bomber is in remarkable condition, with the wings and engine still attached
