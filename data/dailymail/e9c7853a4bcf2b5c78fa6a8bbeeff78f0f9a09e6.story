A schoolgirl died in her father’s arms from an allergic reaction after eating curry and chips for tea, an inquest heard.

Holly Stuckey, 12, collapsed while fighting for her breath from a sudden anaphylactic shock feared to have been triggered by her food.

The hearing was told the 'fit and well' youngster had the meal just an hour before her attack - and told her father: 'I don’t want to die'.

One of Britain’s top allergy experts said it was 'possible' that the chips had triggered the fatal reaction.

Dr Richard Pumphrey told the inquest: 'She had eaten chips and there have been occasions when chips have contained something other than potato.

'It is a possibility - it has been reported in the past, but we are struggling to find a cause.'

The inquest heard that only child Holly had asthma, but had not suffered any food allergies in the past.

'I did my best': Holly's father Clive, pictured with his wife, Lee, in their daughter's bedroom, tried in vain to resuscitate the 12-year-old after she told him: 'I don't want to die'

But Dr Pumphrey, described as an 
eminent expert, said he suspected it was a reaction to her food because 
of her symptoms and the timing of the attack.

The
 inquest heard that on the day of the tragedy Holly had been shopping 
with her dad Clive, 44, and returned to their home in Maesteg, near 
Bridgend, South Wales.

Mr Stuckey said: 'I did her curry and chips, but she didn’t eat much - she was a picky child.

'After the meal, she was complaining she had trouble breathing. She had two puffs on her blue inhaler and one on her purple one.

'She was saying: "I don’t want to die." I was telling her to calm down and relax to help her get her breath back.'

Cause of reaction unknown: Holly, seen here on a family holiday with her father, was described at her inquest as 'fit and well' at the time of her death

The inquest in Aberdare heard Mr Stuckey took his little girl to the bathroom where she slumped unconscious.

He said: 'I put her on her side and started giving her CPR while my wife (Lee) rang for the emergency services.

'I
 have been trained in what to do because of my work - I have fetched a 
few people back. I did my best - I wish I could have done more.'

Holly was taken to hospital, but a crash team was unable to revive her.

Bridgend Coroner Louise Hunt recorded a narrative verdict that Holly died of anaphylactic reaction of unknown cause.

After her death, Holly’s father found letters which described alleged bullying at her school.

Mr Stuckey passed on a list of 13 names of pupils to Maesteg Comprehensive School where an investigation was carried out.

He said after the hearing: 'The school carried out an inquiry and told us there was no proof that Holly was being bullied.'
