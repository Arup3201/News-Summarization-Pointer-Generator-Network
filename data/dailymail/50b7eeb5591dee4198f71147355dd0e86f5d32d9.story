Just when it was starting to look like she might never get over her ex-girlfriend Sam Ronson, Lindsay Lohan has been pictured with a rumoured new love interest.

The troubled star has been spending time with Spencer Falls, and were spotted last week leaving Lindsay's Venice Beach home together.

Spencer is best known in the US as half of the spoof celebrity couple 'Sparah' in Virgin Mobile's latest ad campaign.

But it looks as though the wannabe star has just landed the real deal after he was caught enjoying an intimate dinner and drinks with the Mean Girls actress on July 12.

Lindsay, wearing a paid of black short shorts with a knotted white shirt and black boots, flirted with the good-looking actor over cocktails, Star magazine claim.

It is believed the new couple were introduced by their mutual friend, photographer Tyler Shields.

Shields is a long time friend of Lindsay's and has recently gotten to know Spencer and his onscreen girlfriend, Sarah Carroll, after shooting them for an exhibition.

Lindsay Lohan is due in court today (Thursday) for a progress hearing.

The actress, who is on probation, is due to appear at the LAX Airport Courthouse in Los Angeles.

There is no official word on why Judge Stephanie Sautner is hauling her before the court.

However a source told RadarOnline.com: 'The City Attorney has raised concerns about Lindsay's probation, which will be discussed in court. The City Attorney asked Judge Sautner to order Lindsay to appear.'

Lohan's spokesman confirmed that she will be appearing in court, but didn't elaborate on why.

It is not usual for a defendant to appear at a progress unless there is a problem.

After Lindsay and Spencer's hot date, the pair met up with Tyler for a late-night photoshoot in a tunnel in downtown Los Angeles.

The raunchy shoot sees Spencer fondling Lindsay's breast in one shot, and kissing her neck in another.

Lindsay was pictured leaving Tyler's house in LA after midnight following the shoot.

Shields wrote on his blog of the 
shoot: 'Lindsay Lohan, Spencer Falls and I had way too much fun on this 
one! A little romance never hurt anyone until it ended.

'In matters of love sometimes you have to be willing to get your hands dirty.'

Her
new man gained prominence after being selected to star in the spoof 
Virgin Mobile ads as part of a celebrity couple manufactured by the 
company: 'Perfect strangers who've been pulled from obscurity, they'll 
be given all the trappings of the celebrity lifestyle and inserted into 
the Hollywood scene.'

Spencer has most recently been linked with reality star Stephanie Pratt, posting a picture of the pair on his Facebook page.

'Wonderful night with Stephanie Pratt, amazing gal,' he wrote.

Their
relationship would appear to be yet another spoof, given the current 
'feud' between Sparah and Speidi - Stephanie's brother Spencer and 
sister in law Heidi Montag.

Speidi have accused of Virgin of ripping off their likeness for the campaign and have asked for compensation.

Pratt says: 'They should being paying for using our likeness. It's obvious they are trying to be us.'

But
reps for the 'couple' ave declined to respond to the feud, saying 
Sparah are too busy 'due to their pressing endorsement commitments with 
Virgin Mobile and their frequent interactions with real celebrities,' 
say TMZ.
