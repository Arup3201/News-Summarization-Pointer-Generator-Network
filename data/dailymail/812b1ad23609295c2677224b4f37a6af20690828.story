One of Europe’s busiest airports was forced to shut down its new runway on Wednesday after a commercial aircraft carrying hundreds of people skidded off a taxiway.

The KLM Royal Dutch Airlines flight had just landed at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol from Nairobi, Kenya when it suddenly veered off course and came to a stop with its front wheels in the grass.

There were no problems with the landing and no injuries were reported after the Boeing 747-400 went off track while taxiing to the terminal.

Passenger Vincent Verweij, who posted photos of the plane on Twitter, said the flight crew informed passengers that the aircraft had suffered a problem with its brakes.

He told RTL Nieuws that the plane came to a sudden stop around 6am but he didn’t realise there was a problem until the announcement from the cockpit. 

Vincent said passengers remained calm and they were stranded on the plane for around an hour until stairs and buses arrived to transport them to the terminal.

Schiphol diverted flights to other runways for several hours until the plane was removed.

The plane is being inspected by technicians and the cause of the incident remains under investigation.
