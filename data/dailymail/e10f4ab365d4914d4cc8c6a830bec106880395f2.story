High school football star Nathaniel Fujita did an internet search about whether or not water erases finger prints just hours after he strangled and killed his former girlfriend.

Nathaniel Fujita, 20, is accused of luring Lauren Astley to his Massachusettes home on July 3, 2011, strangling her with a bungee chord and slashing her throat open though his lawyers argue the murder took place in a fit of insane rage.

Today, a forensic investigator testified that Fujita looked at pictures of himself shirtless and joined a Facebook group helping to raise awareness about Astley's disappearance, even though he knew he was the one to kill her and dump the body in a marsh just hours before.

At 12.58am on the night of July 3, 
2011- the day of his girlfriend's murder-  Fujita looked at a page 
titled 'Does water remove fingerprints'.

According to The Boston Globe, he also joined the group 'have you 
seen Lauren Astley?' and then he was still awake at 4.23am and looked at
two pictures of himself as he was posing shirtless in sports shorts.

During cross examination, Fujita's 
lawyer asked the forensic investigator about  whether or not the 
then-teen had searched the internet to find out information about 
weapons, and he had not.

The point of the question was to help 
bolster his case that Fujita was a teen with health issues who snapped 
and had mental episode that lead him to kill his long-term girlfriend.

Fujita arranged to meet Astley, who had been texting and calling to check up on him, at his house on July 3, and police say he then killed her in the garage

The prosecutor also showed the 
bloodied and torn leopard print spaghetti strap dress that Astley was 
wearing on the day she died. The site of the dress made her mother, Mary
Dunne, weep.

Earlier in the trial, Fujita's uncle and cousin were taken onto the stand.

The uncle, Phillip Saba, said that he 
voted 'nothing unusual' in Fujita's demeanor at their family fourth of 
July barbeque the day after the murder.

Trial: Nathaniel Fujita, right, and defense attorney William Sullivan watch July 3, 2011, security camera video footage of Lauren Astley ascending an escalator at the Natick Mall

Mother: Mary Dunn sobbed quietly in the gallery as the CCTV footage was shown to the court earlier in the trial and on Wednesday she wept again when her daughter's last outfit

Victim: Phone records show that 18-year-old Lauren talked to Nathanial several times before going to meet him after she finished work at the local mall

The more damning evidence came from 
his cousin Caroline Saba who said that he specifically said 'They're not
going to find a weapon there if that's what you mean.'

Fujita was arrested after a search of 
his family's home found blood in the garage and his clothing - which was
stained with blood - stashed in the attic.

Fujita was spotted driving shirtless, 
car windows down and music blaring, mere moments after allegedly dumping
the 18-year-old's body, according to the filings.

Prosecutors allege Fujita made an 
elaborate but failed attempt to cover up; police found bloody clothing 
and sneakers in the Fujita home, in addition to a second pair of wet 
sneakers and a sweatshirt with mud in the pockets.

One of the biggest points of argument 
is whether or not the murder was premeditated; the prosecution argues 
that he actively planned the killing and tried to cover it up 
afterwards, while the defense argues that he snapped.

Murder trial: Nathanial Fujita and his ex girlfriend Lauren Astley both went to the same high school

Suspect: Prosecutors believe Fujita cut his ex-girlfriend's throat, strangled her with a bungee cord and dumped her body in a swamp

Prosecutors believe Fujita took 
Astley’s Jeep Grand Cherokee from his home and drove it to the Wayland 
Town Beach parking lot, then dumped the keys in a storm drain.

Phone records show that as she 
finished up her shift at a local store on the final day of her life, 
Fujita and Lauren had a number of conversations and she told co-workers 
that she was going to meet him after she left the mall.

Her parents reported her missing shortly after she failed to return home from work that day.
