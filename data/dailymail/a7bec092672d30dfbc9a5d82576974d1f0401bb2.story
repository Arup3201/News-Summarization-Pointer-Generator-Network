A competitive shooter satisfied both his appetites by wrapping his gun in bacon and using the heat generated when firing to cook and eat it.

Dustin Ellermann, a self-taught marksman and avid hunter, is captured on camera applying the rashers of bacon to his Gemtech TREK 5.56mm suppressor that rests on the back of a pick-up truck.

Either Dustin or the video maker mutters under their breath: ‘So much America right now’, before the competitive shooter secures the bacon in place with some tin foil, which is also wrapped around the suppressor.

Getting into position, Dustin lifts his Pre-86 M16 Lower rifle and begins firing rounds of Wolf 223 – spraying shells in every direction.

Pausing to reload Dustin laughs and says: ‘I was like, what’s that sound?’ Referring to the sizzling noise coming from the suppressor of his gun.

Dustin fires more bullets before pausing once again to examine his rifle.

This time smoke billows from the tip of it and the sizzling of the bacon cooking can be heard even more clearly.

The competitive shooter fires one last time and the vibrations caused by the bullets leaving the gun cause the tin foil to fly from the suppressor.

Stopping to admire the bacon, Dustin says: ‘There’s nothing wrong with that’ before taking his gun back to the pick-up truck.

Dustin fires around 90 rounds with the intention to heat the suppressor so much that it will cook the bacon

Once there, Dustin uses a pair of tongs to remove the bacon and utters in excitement as it unravels looking, if anything, slightly overdone.

The thread mount suppressor used in the video is made from stainless steel and an Inconel alloy, which allows it to function under high heat and pressure.

The video concludes with the shooter, clearly impressed with the outcome, wolfing down the bacon.

Laughing he says: ‘Let’s go and kill some more pigs’ before rubbing his hands together in satisfaction.

Dustin Ellermann was a competitor on the third season of the History Channel's marksmen competition ‘Top Shot’, which he later won.

Born into a small community in Zavalla, Texas – where the video takes place – the competitive shooter is also the director of a Christian camp.
