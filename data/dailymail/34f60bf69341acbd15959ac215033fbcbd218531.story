The chance of dying in a plane crash may been cut by advances in aircraft design, but a plane's growing reliance on technology is posing a new type of risk.

Now, a group of industry heavyweights has warned that cybercrime is a serious threat to safety in the skies, and have vowed to fight the growing scourge before it causes a catastrophic incident.

The warning follows a series of suspected attacks, including theories that the missing Malaysian Airline planes may have been hijacked by cyber criminals.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) recently signed a new cyber security agreement, formalising their front against cybercrime.

'Our common goal in developing this agreement is to work more effectively together to establish and promote a robust cyber security culture and strategy for the benefit of all actors in our industry,' said Raymond Benjamin, secretary general of the ICAO.

He added: 'As technologies rapidly evolve and become more readily accessible to all, cyber threats cannot be ignored.

'This is an important new area of aviation security concern and our global community will ensure that it is met with a strong level of commitment and response.'

Risk: In theory, study shows a hacker could use a plane's onboard Wi-Fi signal or inflight entertainment system to hack into its avionics equipment, potentially disrupting or modifying satellite communication

Earlier this year, a chilling theory was put forward that the missing Malaysian Airlines plane could have been hijacked using a mobile phone or USB stick.

An anti-terror said he believes the speed, altitude and direction of the aircraft could have been changed, simply by sending radio signals from a small remote device.

A framework of 'codes' created by cyber terrorists would also be able to get into the plane's in-flight entertainment system and override the security software.

It is also believed, once the systems have been successfully hacked, the plane could be landed by remote control.

Panic: The tweet from hacker Lizard Squad in August was sent shortly after the person or group claimed credit for an attack on Sony's Playstation Network

A bomb threat in August seemingly targeting the president of Sony Online Entertainment forced an American Airlines flight from Dallas to San Diego to divert its path to Phoenix Sunday.

The threat was posted to Twitter and specifically called out Sony Online Entertainment president John Smedley.

'@AmericanAir We have been receiving reports that @j_smedley's plane #362 from DFW to SAN has explosives on-board, please look into this,' read the tweet from hacker 'Lizard Squad.'

The threat came after the Sony Playstation Network service was taken down by 'an attempt to overwhelm our network with artificially high traffic,' the company said.

The Dallas Morning News reported at the time that 'Lizard Squad' - which could be a single person or a collective - took credit for the hack. 

Sony maintains no personal data was compromised.

Smedley later wrote on Twitter that his flight had been diverted but he did not comment on the bomb threat.

While threats such as this are a concern to passengers, aviation chiefs have warned that far more sophisticated cyber attacks could be on the cards. 

The theory emerged as the search for flight MH370, which went missing eight months ago, continues to draw blanks.

Dr Sally Leivesley, a former Home Office official, said: 'It might well be the world's first cyber hijack.'

In August, a Berlin-based hacker claimed to have found a way to infiltrate communication systems on planes through Wi-Fi and inflight entertainment systems.

Ruben Santamarta, a consultant with cyber security firm IOActive, said he discovered the vulnerabilities by 'reverse engineering' - or decoding - highly specialised software known as firmware, used to operate communications equipment.

In theory, a hacker could use a plane's onboard Wi-Fi signal or inflight entertainment system to hack into its avionics equipment, potentially disrupting or modifying satellite communications.

This could interfere with the aircraft's navigation and safety systems, Mr Santamarta said.

'Cyber terrorism may replace the hijacker and bomber and become the weapon of choice on attacks against the aviation community,' German insurer Allianz said in a review of aviation safety published last week.
