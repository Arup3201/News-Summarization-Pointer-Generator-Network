Louise Troh, 54, was confined when she learned her fiance Thomas Eric Duncan had died of Ebola on October 8th and has now landed herself a book deal

The fiancée of the Liberian man who died of Ebola in Dallas last month has landed a book deal to write her memoir for a publishing company affiliated with movie mogul Harvey Weinstein.

Louise Troh, 54, will have a book planned for release in April by Weinstein Books about her relationship with Thomas Eric Duncan, who flew from Liberia to Dallas in September to marry her.

Duncan became ill shortly after arriving and died on October 8th. He is the only person to have died from Ebola in the United States.

His family said it had reached a settlement with the Dallas hospital that treated Duncan and admitted to making mistakes in his care. Troh was not included in the settlement.

'It was supposed to be the first happy day of a new life of joy for us all. But before we could make our new family, he died a terrible death in a quarantined room,' Troh said in a statement.

'I am writing this book to tell people about Eric, about our love story, about our family and about my faith that has been tested but not broken,' she said.

Troh, her 13-year-old son and two others were placed in 21-day quarantine after Duncan tested positive the virus. She lost almost all her possessions when her apartment was decontaminated and has been living in a residence provided by the Dallas Catholic Dioceses.

Although Troh has been declared healthy, she had been unable to find a place to live because of the stigma related to her exposure to Ebola, her family said however she is now is settling into a Dallas condominium

Louise Troh said Friday she is 'relieved' to be able to leave her daughter's cramped, two-bedroom apartment for her own home.

'Thanks be to God I found a place to lay my head,' she said.

'Patient zero': Thomas Eric Duncan was diagnosed with Ebola in Texas and became the first person to die of the disease in the U.S.

The condo was purchased by three families who attend Wilshire Baptist Church with Troh, according to the church's pastor, George Mason. Troh will pay them rent.

The three-bedroom unit is located in Vickery Meadows, the densely populated immigrant neighborhood near downtown Dallas where Troh and three others lived before being evacuated after Duncan became the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States. 

Except for a few bins of photographs and personal items, everything in Troh's former apartment was taken away and burned because of possible contamination. Duncan stayed with Troh for 10 days before his first trip to the emergency room.

Troh's new home has been furnished by the nonprofit Dwell with Dignity, Mason said.
