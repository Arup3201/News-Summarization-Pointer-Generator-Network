She is known for her curve-hugging ‘wiggle’ dresses. But when Nigella Lawson wore not one, but two stunning designs from a small British dressmaker last week, she caused the firm’s website to go ‘into meltdown’.

The TV chef first stepped out in New York on Tuesday in a show-stopping £135 red ‘Catherine’ dress from London-based Diva Catwalk to promote the new series of her US cookery show The Taste.

A spokeswoman for the fashion label told The Mail on Sunday: ‘We are only a small firm but Nigella has been a fan for years. We don’t know how she first heard of us but she’s been wearing our designs for a couple of years now.

‘Last year she wore our Midhurst dress on The Taste and the response was so overwhelming that our website crashed. She only has to wear a dress once for there to be a deluge in orders. We call it the Nigella factor.

‘This week we were inundated with calls and internet orders when she wore the Catherine dress, which sold out immediately. Our phone lines and internet have gone into meltdown.

‘It’s amazing how Nigella promotes British design. We could not be more thrilled. We are only a small company but when Nigella wears our dresses the world notices and we sell out.

‘We are incredibly grateful to her for her support.’

Daring: The 54-year-old presenter later tweeted that she was unaware how revealing her dress was as she sat behind her judge’s desk

On Thursday night, The Taste aired on America’s ABC network and Nigella again wore a Diva Catwalk creation, this time a low-cut pale blue £115 ‘Opal’ dress.

The 54-year-old – known as the Domestic Goddess – later tweeted that she was unaware how revealing it was as she sat behind her judge’s desk, writing: ‘I had no idea quite so much décolletage was on display; mortified.’

Other celebrities including Carol Vorderman and Olympian Denise Lewis are fans of Diva Catwalk’s figure-hugging designs, but the firm’s spokeswoman said: ‘Only Nigella gets the phone ringing off the hook. 

'It’s because she always looks so amazing and our dresses flatter her in all the right places.’

Comeback: It was a triumphant return to the US last week for Nigella, who was previously barred from the United States over allegations made during a court case in Britain last year that she took cocaine

It was a triumphant return to the US last week for Nigella, who was previously barred from the United States over allegations made during a court case in Britain last year that she took cocaine and smoked cannabis.

She later sorted out her visa and was allowed back into the country to record a third series of the show, in which she appears alongside celebrity chefs Anthony Bourdain, Marcus Samuelsson and Ludo Lefebvre.

But while Nigella’s appearance won over American viewers, one of her team’s culinary creations – deep-fried macaroni cheese balls – failed to win approval and the contestant was the first to be voted off the show.
