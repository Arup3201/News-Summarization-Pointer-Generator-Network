Feeling constantly tired and thirsty, and struggling with her weight, a worried Claire Ayton decided to seek help from her GP.

Blood tests failed to uncover the cause of the problem and she decided, in desperation, to see a hypnotist.

It was then that the unlikely cause of her health problems emerged – she was a Diet Coke addict. Mrs Ayton, a mother of two, failed to mention to her doctor that for ten years she had been drinking seven pints of Diet Coke a day – at a cost of up to £1,300 a year.

Addiction: Claire Ayton eyes up two bottles of Diet Coke - the amount she used to drink every day

Revitalised: Claire Ayton is an ex Diet Coke addict after drinking seven pints a day for 10 years

Far from helping her lose weight, the 36-year-old actually put on three stone – leaving her weighing almost 13-and-a-half stone by this summer. It was only when she visited hypnotist Russell Hemmings, based in Coventry, for help losing weight that she was told she was a fizzy drink addict.

After drinking around 7,300 bottles in a decade, she has been on a permanent Diet Coke break since August – and feeling revitalised.

The teaching assistant, from Pailton, Warwickshire, said: ‘I didn’t think of it as an addiction. It was an everyday thing. I’d have one coffee in the morning and nothing else to drink but diet cola for the rest of the day.

‘I was always thirsty. People used to comment how many bottles of diet pop we bought at the supermarket or kept in the house. I just thought, “Well I drink it all”.’

She added: ‘When I told Russell how much diet pop I was drinking he was quite surprised and said I needed to cut it out of my diet to improve my health and drink more water.

‘I looked up the side effects of the artificial sweeteners on the internet. Allegedly aspartame is the worst.

‘It’s in lots of diet drinks. I was definitely suffering side effects.’

The ‘cold turkey’ was tough, she admitted.

Artificially sweetened diet drinks may cause you to pile on the pounds rather than aid weight loss, say scientists.

A study review by Professor Qing Yang at Yale University found aspartame and saccharin both increased the desire to eat more.  

The
 June 2010 paper found that artificial sweeteners can active food reward
 brain centres without fully satisfying the resulting cravings.

So while the drinks themselves contain hardly any calories they may encourage consumers to reach for another treat afterwards.

‘I had headaches and on the third day I felt as though I had been beaten up,’ added Mrs Ayton.

‘But then I started to feel better. My head is clearer, not so fuzzy, and I have much more energy. I’ve lost 5lb so far. I’d like to lose two-and-a-half stone. Now I just drink water with a chunk of orange. And our monthly shop is cheaper – we could go on holiday somewhere nice and sunny for that.’

Mr Hemmings described this as  ‘the worst case of fizzy drink addiction I have ever treated’. ‘I’m so glad she’s kicked the habit,’ he said. ‘When Claire first came to see me she was very lethargic, had no motivation and was sitting on the settee eating junk food.

‘Now she is drinking two litres of water a day, doing exercise classes and her diet has improved.

‘A lot of overweight clients come in with diet drinks because they see it as a “no-calorie” sweet treat. Slim clients tend to drink water.’

In June, U.S. researchers confirmed artificial sweeteners and diet drinks cause weight gain, possibly by boosting a craving for sugary foods.
