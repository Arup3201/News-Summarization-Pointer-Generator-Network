The South Carolina 
state trooper who arrested NFL defensive lineman Sam Montgomery at a 
traffic stop last June has been fired, state officials said Friday.

The
 Department of Public Safety said in a news release that Lance Cpl. R.S.
 Salter was terminated for violating agency policies including conduct 
unbecoming a state employee.

Salter stopped Montgomery in June when the 
Cincinnati Bengals defensive lineman was returning to his home in 
Greenwood.

The Department of Public Safety said in a news release that Lance Cpl. R.S. Salter was terminated for violating agency policies including conduct unbecoming a state employee when he threatened Bengals lineman Sam Montgomery with a Taser

Montgomery said he was returning home to Greenwood when pulled over for exceeding the speed limit

Montgomery was arrested and spent a
 night in jail after Salter clocked him going 89 mph in a 55 mph zone.

But the trooper's dashboard camera obtained soon after by The Associated
 Press also captured the officer threatening to use a Taser because the 
6-foot-3, 262-pound lineman was struggling to understand his commands.

'The next thing you're going to get is the Taser,' Salter was heard to say on the tape.

'Whoa,' Montgomery responded, 'I'm not trying to cause problems.'

Montgomery 
said he was returning home to Greenwood when pulled over. He played 
football for Greenwood High, then spent three seasons at LSU where he 
had 19 career sacks and helped the Tigers to the 2011 national 
championship game won by Alabama.

Montgomery
 was selected by Houston in the third round of the 2013 draft. However, 
he was inactive for the Texans' first seven games and waived by the club
 last October. Oakland signed him to the practice squad in December.

Montgomery signed with Cincinnati as a free agent in April.

At
 the time of the incident, agency spokeswoman Sherri Iacobelli said in a
 statement the department expects troopers treat the public with 
courtesy and respect.

When
 Montgomery's arrest was brought to the agency's attention, 'we began a 
review of the traffic stop and self-initiated an internal 
investigation,' Iacobelli says.

Salter
 was suspended soon after the stop while the agency investigated.

The 
department's Office of Professional Responsibility found Salter's 
behavior was unprofessional and comments to Montgomery during the arrest
 were inappropriate, according to a release sent by agency 
communications director Sherri Iacobelli.

Montgomery's ticket was dismissed by a judge in July when Salter did not show up for traffic court in Laurens.

The
 agency said Salter's interactions with Montgomery were 'inconsistent 
with how he was trained to conduct a traffic stop.'

Its release said 
Salter's command, 'NFL, you are under arrest,' to Montgomery could be 
seen as suggesting that he was being arrested because of his status as a
 pro football player.

Salter also deviated 
from protocol when he immediately arrested Montgomery without telling 
him why he was stopped, the agency said.

The agency said Salter's interactions with Montgomery were 'inconsistent with how he was trained to conduct a traffic stop'

The 
department's statement said Salter's comments to Montgomery on the ride 
to the detention center were inappropriate at times, including when he 
said, 'we can pull that (seat belt) across you tight and lock it, and we
 make it a very uncomfortable ride to jail.'

The
 department said that Salter's assertion to Montgomery that at 25 mph 
over the speed limit, 'you get arrested,' was a misrepresentation of 
facts because its investigation showed Salter arrested some violators 
and not others in similar circumstances.

The agency said Salter was disciplined previously for unprofessional conduct and making inappropriate comments.

'These violations demonstrate behavior that is inconsistent' with agency standards, the department said.

The Associated Press attempted to reach Salter for comment. Two phone numbers listed for him have been disconnected.

Long before signing with the Bengals, Montgomery played football for Greenwood High, then spent three seasons at LSU where he had 19 career sacks and helped the Tigers to the 2011 national championship game won by Alabama

Montgomery
 was compliant and friendly during the stop, accepting responsibility 
for his actions on the ride to jail, according to the dashboard camera.

'Bad deal,' he said. 'Trying to get home. I'll take the lick. I was 
wrong.'

Montgomery was a standout defender at 
Greenwood High and LSU before getting drafted by the Houston Texans in 
the third round of the 2013 draft.

However, he was inactive for the 
Texans' first seven games and waived by the club last October. Oakland 
signed him to the practice squad in December.

Montgomery signed with Cincinnati as a free agent in April.
