A research scientist suffering from cervical cancer was saved thanks to a drug she helped to develop.

Dr Hayley Farmer, 39, works for Cancer Research UK as part of a team responsible for clinical trials on new medicines and vaccines.

She was part of the office that was working on Cisplatin - a chemotherapy drug being tested on different types of cancer.

Cancer Research worker Hayley Farmer was cured of cervical cancer with a drug she had helped to develop

Dr Farmer said she had been motivated to work for Cancer Research UK in the first place because she had recently lost her grandmother to cancer

But as she carried out her work, Dr Farmer had no idea she might need the treatment herself - until a routine smear test in 2007 revealed she had cervical cancer.

The cancer was already too advanced for surgery and Dr Farmer was treated with radiotherapy followed by Cisplatin.

Dr Farmer, from Bristol, was given the all clear from cancer last year thanks to the pioneering drug.

She said: 'I have always been very passionate about what I do and why I do it.

'I wanted to work for Cancer Research UK in the first place because I had recently lost my grandmother to cancer.

'But now I have had my own experience it makes me so grateful for doing the job I do.

'It was quite surreal when I was first told, I see the cancer work every day, although it is very different when it is you.'

Dr Farmer worked on the drug as part of a team at Cancer Research UK's head office in London.

She said she found her cancer experience 'positive' and used fighting the disease as a chance to take time off work and go travelling.

Dr Farmer added that she feels lucky to be in a country where cancer screening is available to pick up cases like hers.

She said: 'I am appreciative of all the patients who go through clinical trials. In some cases it doesn't help them, but it helps people in the future.

'For me there is a personal connection because if it had not been for people going through clinical trials I might not be here.

'We did some of the early work on the drug I got and that really does put it in perspective - if it wasn't for people doing that 20 years ago I wouldn't be here.'

Dr Farmer has raised more than Â£14,000 for Cancer Research and even climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in aid of the charity. For more information visit www.cancerresearchuk.org
