Taxpayers paid more than £3,000 for every badger killed in last year’s cull.

Official figures revealed the final cost to the public purse of the cull was £6.3 million - with some 1,879 badgers killed. 

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural affairs revealed the figures last night.

The Government could have faced estimated costs of £100 million a year if the cull, designed to protect farms from the spread of tuberculosis among cattle, had not taken place.

A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said the price of the cull was due to rigorous safety rules and the humane methods used by its marksmen.

Overall, the programme was said to have cost £6,294,000 to kill 955 badgers in Somerset and 924 in Gloucestershire – meaning it cost around £3,350 per badger.

Around £2.6 million was spent monitoring ‘humaneness’ and £2.3 million on ‘efficiency’.

A test cull began last year in the West of England, and was later extended when marksmen missed their targets.

The Government has already approved a second cull for this year. 

However, Labour told the Daily Telegraph that last year’s attempt to reduce the spread of TB had come at a ‘huge cost to the taxpayer’ with little effect.

A Defra spokesman said: 'England has the highest incidence of bovine TB in Europe. The cost of the badger culls need to be seen in the context of the devastating scale of the threat bovine TB poses to our farming industry and food security - £500million over the last decade. Doing nothing is not an option.

'We are pursuing a comprehensive strategy, including tighter cattle movement controls, badger vaccination and culling.

'Many of the costs associated with the pilot culls last year were one-offs and have not been repeated this year.'
