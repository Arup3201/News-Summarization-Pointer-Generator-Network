It’s been almost a year since the ferocious bushfire that left 700 people stranded without homes, but Guy Sebastian and his wife Jules have reached out to help the community get back on its feet.

The Winmalee Street in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney was left devastated after being ravaged by the blaze that destroyed more than 200 homes on October 17, 2013.

The married duo celebrated the official opening of a children’s playground, which was donated by their own family charity, The Sebastian Foundation on Saturday morning.

TV presenter and stylist Jules told Daily Mail Australia that the new foundation aims at making an impact on families.

‘We just wanted to do something to help the Winmalee community because families help families,’ she said.

‘When you lose your home, you lose everything and we wanted to help the community get through this tough time after what had happened last year. 

'We discovered the centre didn't have a place for kids to play and after listening to parents talk about going through this tough time, we thought it would be a good idea to make a kids zone.

'The playground is a way of injecting some all-important family fun time, for not only the kids, but for the adults to enjoy too - bringing everyone together.' 

The area features a play centre, creative zone for kids and an outdoor meeting space for parents.

The pair were joined by ambassador and former yellow Wiggle Sam Moran at the Winmalee Community Day to unveil the new $30,000 play area which took almost six months to complete.

'It's so great working with Sam because he's the perfect fit for our foundation,' Jules said.

'He's such a nice person and with his experience working in kids shows, he's really entertaining to the kids and we're all about families and kids.'

Despite the good cause, Jules said there are some exciting new plans coming up for the pair.

'Guy has been working on an album, which is about to be released and his new single is coming out very soon,' she said.

'We've been busy travelling to all sorts of places and with the Aria Awards coming up, I'll be busy styling and I've just finished wrapping up the TV series Bringing Sexy Back as well.

'The Christmas Carols are coming up on December 14 and it's my favourite time of the year.

'But right now, our main focus is getting the awareness out there and basically do more fundraising so we can work on the next project.'
