A 54-year-old Atlanta woman who lost more than half her body weight through a diet and exercise overhaul now wants to inspire others.

Val McLeod told ABC's Good Morning America on Friday that after struggling with obesity since childhood, her turning point came when she had to be weighed in hospital by a freight scale.

Ms McLeod, who weighed 620lbs at her heaviest, is now an author and motivational speaker.

On her worst days, Ms McLeod said she would consume over 30,000 calories, eating fried chicken, cookies, chips, ice cream and soda in portion sizes that were large enough for three people.

By her mid-twenties, she was using upholstery fabric to make clothes because she couldn't find anything that fit, even in plus-size stores.

'We would just roll out as much fabric, yards, as I needed and put elastic in the waist,' she explained.After decades of failed dieting, Ms McLeod attempted gastric bypass surgery in 1989 - dangerous for a woman of her size - and went into respiratory failure during the procedure. She was on life support for three days.

In preparation for the surgery, she had to be weighed. Too heavy for the hospital scales, Ms McLeod was taken outside and loaded onto the freight scale. 'I wanted to die!' she says of the experience.

But finally, she had received the wake-up call she needed so badly.

Ms McLeoad, who explained on her Facebook page, Shaped 4 Success, that she 'had no idea what healthy eating was,' hired a nutritionist to educate her on health and wellness and a therapist to help her overcome some of the deeper emotional issues she had with food.

'Weight loss and being overweight is as much mental, psychological as it is physical,' she explains.

Slowly, she started to incorporate exercise into her daily routine. When she first started walking, Ms McLeod said she could 'barely even go a block.' She now tries to exercise at least five times a week and walks four miles a day.

Ms McLeod, who attributes the 'lions share' of her weight loss to WeightWatchers, no longer eats processed food and now sticks to a diet of fruit, vegetables and fish.

She has lost a whopping 393lbs in total, an achievement that took her 25 years, and says she still wants to lose 50lbs more.

'Make one change that's healthier and the body is so intelligent, I say the body has a brain, it will respond to anything you do for it that's in the right direction,' Ms McLeod says.

She has now written a book 'Empoword - Build a Life of Success with Powerful, Positive Language!' and is a certified trainer, retreat and seminar leader.Â
