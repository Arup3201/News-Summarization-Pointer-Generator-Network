Thousands of people due to buy and sell their homes faced delays and the risk of putting lengthy property chains in jeopardy today after the system used to electronically transfer money failed. 

The Bank of England said the mechanism it uses to transfer payments between commercial banks - which includes that used to purchase houses - was hit by technical problems and was suspended at 6am today.

It is unable to give an indication when the system will be running again. 

The Bank of England said it could guarantee all payments would be processed but was unable to confirm whether these would all be done today.

The Bank of England announced that a system used to make computerised payments went down at 6am today

This means some property transactions, particularly those involving long chains, could be put at risk. 

The Bank of England said computerised payments on the Real Time Gross Settlement Payment System (RTGS) were suspended this morning because of a technical issue, which has also affected its Chaps (Clearing House Automated Payment System) system.  

Chaps is used to carry out same-day electronic payments for house purchases and is used in the majority of property transactions. 

The system handles on average 138,245 transactions per day, worth around £277bn. These transactions include short term lending between financial institutions, foreign exchange and house purchases. 

The failure of the Chaps system, which processes 5,000 property transactions a day, could risk chains 

Chaps is used by 5,000 financial institutions. 

A spokeswoman for the Bank of England said the issues were caused by a 'manual update' over the weekend. 

Mark Carney is the Governor of the Bank of England 

She said that the bank could guarantee it would process all transactions but could not say when these would all be completed, as it would depend on when the system was back online.

 The Bank said it has a number of options open to it to ensure payments made today will be cleared, such as an extending the working day.

Chaps is a separate organisation to the Bank, funded by lenders who pay fees to use its services. However, Chaps does use the Bank’s RTGS network to run its system. 

The Chaps service usually closes at 4pm each day but Phil Kenworthy, CHAPS Managing Director confirmed it will stay open longer today to process payments. He advised anyone due to make payments using Chaps to contact their bank.

A spokeswoman for Chaps said that while the system handles a lot of house purchases, people who wanted to pay a deposit could do so using the faster payments system as long as the payment was below £100,000. 

Faster payments and direct debits have not been affected by the issue.

Andrew Montlake, from mortgage broker Coreco, told the Guardian: 'If there are going to be Chaps issues then we won't know yet – transfers usually need to be done by 3pm if someone is to complete on that day. 

It's worth adding that Monday is not the biggest completion day – Fridays tend to be the most popular day.'

The Bank of England said the most important payments in the wider RTGS system are being handled manually.

It added that it was working to resolve the issue.

In a statement it said: 'The Bank of England has identified a technical issue related to some routine maintenance of the RTGS payment system and has paused settlement while we resolve it.

'We are working to address this issue as quickly as possible, and restart the RTGS payment system in a controlled manner.' 

The system was restored at 4pm, and the Bank of England said opening hours would be extended until 8pm to deal with the backlog of payments. Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, confirmed he would be carrying out an independent review into the cause of the problems and the effectiveness of the bank's response. 

A statement from Chaps said: 'We are pleased to report that the problem was resolved mid-afternoon and, following an extension to the CHAPS processing day, just under 143,000 payments were settled - in line with the normal average day's volumes.'
