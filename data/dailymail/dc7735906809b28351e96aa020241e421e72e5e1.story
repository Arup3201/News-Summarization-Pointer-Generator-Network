The man accused of pushing a subway rider to his death on a set of New York City subway tracks said he was attacked first.

Naeem Davis, 30, told reporters as he was escorted to jail by police officers: 'He attacked me first. He grabbed me.'

He added he did not intend to kill Mr Han in the comments captured by PIX11 television news.

Ki Suk Han, 58, was crushed to death by an oncoming train on Monday as commuters watched from the platform.

Yesterday, Naeem Davis, 30, was charged with one count of second degree murder, New York City Police said.

Charged: Naeem Davis, 30, was arrested and charged with the murder of Ki-Suk Han, 58, who he allegedly pushed onto the subway tracks when an oncoming car was approaching

Davis, who is homeless, was refused 
bail pending a second court appearance on December 11, Manhattan 
Criminal Court Judge Lynn Kottler said at a hearing yesterday.

He was also charged one count of second degree murder with depraved indifference,

The incident at 49th Street station 
was captured in dramatic photographs of the train bearing down on the 
victim by a freelance photographer.

Mr Han can be seen trying to clamber back onto the platform as the train approaches but he was no one on the platform tried to assist him.

The incident has led to soul searching in New York and raised questions about why nobody rushed to the victim's aid.

Amateur video taken at the scene showed Davis and Han arguing moments before Han was shoved.

On Tuesday, Davis 'implicated himself' to police and was brought to court yesterday.

Manhattan prosecutor James Lin said at the hearing that Davis 'has admitted to lifting [the victim] off 
his feet and pushing off the wall behind him to add more force' to the 
fatal thrust.

The previous day, Mr Han's family spoke of their 'disbelief' over his death.

At an emotional press conference his 
daughter Ashley and widow Serim battled through tears describing how 
they are haunted that no one tried to save their loved one.

Student Ashley, 20, said: 'My dad was 
always someone who wanted to pursue the American dream. He really 
enforced my education and he was just always there for me. It's just 
devastating that he's gone and I'm still in disbelief.'

When asked about her feelings that no 
one tried to help her father, Ashley said: 'What's done is done. The 
thought of someone helping him up in a matter of seconds would have been
 great.'

Speaking softly in Korean with her head bowed, Mrs Han, who was married to her husband for more than 22 years, thanked supporters and asked the media for privacy.

She said: 'We are now grieving because we've lost a husband and a father.'

Grisly death: 58-year-old Ki Suk Han was killed by a subway train after being pushed into its path in Times Square on Monday

Photographer R.Umar Abbasi, who took pictures of Mr Han's last moments, said he was too far away to help during an interview with the Today Show

Meanwhile the news photographer whose 
pictures of Mr Han in the path of the train unleashed a maelstrom of 
criticism said he was too far from the victim to offer help.

R. Umar Abbasi, a freelance 
photographer for the tabloid New York Post, said he rapidly shot dozens 
of frames so that his flash might alert the motorman and that he himself
 was too far away to help.

Seconds later the train struck and killed Mr Han.

'My condolences to the family, and if I could have, I would have pulled Mr. Han out,' Abbasi said on NBC's Today show.

Controversial: The New York Post put photo of Mr Han on their cover

The newspaper featured one of Mr Abbasi's photographs on its front page under the headline 'Doomed'.

He showed Mr Han trying to pull himself from the tracks and looking into the lights of the oncoming train.

In a first-person account published in
 the Post, Mr Abbasi said the incident 'was one of the most horrible 
things I have ever seen, to watch that man dying there.'

'The sad part is, there were people 
who were close to the victim, who watched and didn't do anything. You 
can see it in the pictures.'

The motorman, Terrence Legree, was treated for shock after the incident, the New York Daily News reported.

Legree, who could see Han from his 
seat at the head of the train, told the Daily News he noticed people on 
the platform waving their arms to warn him and said he slammed on the 
emergency brake when he saw Han on the roadbed.

Legree said he was feeling 'all kinds 
of emotions from "Why is this happening" to "Why was that guy down 
there" to "What happened?"'

Mr Han's death has caused huge shock 
in the city and led to pondering from some of the five million people 
who use the New York subway every day.

Commuter Denise Martorana, 34, said: 
'I would certainly try to do whatever I possibly could. I certainly 
wouldn't be able to stand there and watch, that's for sure.'

Aliyah Syphrett, 23, said she tries not to think about the risk of being pushed during her daily commute.

She said: 'You know it could happen. 
So when it does happen it's scary but then what it all comes down to is 
you have to protect yourself.'

Diana Henry, 79, a Long Island resident, who was waiting for a train at 34th Street, stood as far from the platform as possible.

She said: 'I'm always careful, but I'm
 even more careful after what happened. I stand back because there are 
so many crazies in this city that you never know.'
