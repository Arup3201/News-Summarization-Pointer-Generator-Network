At first glance, it looks like a perfectly normal helicopter.

But Northrop Grumman’s new MQ-8C Fire Scout is missing one key thing - a pilot.

The craft, shown off at a trade show this week, has been stuffed with electronics so it can be flown as a drone - but with all the same capabilities as a normal helicopter.

The ultimate drone in numbers

The MQ-8C Fire Scout is a fully autonomous, fourblade, single-engine unmanned helicopter.

'It will carry an array of 
reconnaissance, surveillance and target acquisition (RSTA) sensors to  
support warfighters’ demands for enhanced situational awareness,' the 
firm said.

'The craft combines the best of two proven air systems in a low-cost, fast-fielding package,' said the defence firm.

Earlier this year the US Navy awarded Northrop Grumman a $71 million contract to procure six additional MQ-8C Fire-X variants, for a total of 30 aircraft.

George Vardoulakis, vice president for tactical unmanned systems with Northrop Grumman's Aerospace Systems sector said, 'this contract provides significant momentum for the work Northrop Grumman and its supply chain partners are doing to meet the Navy's requirements.'

The drone is based on a Bell 407 
helicopter, which is often used by hospitals, news organizations, movie 
studios and law  enforcement agencies worldwide.

Over 1,000 have been sold, with over 3 million accumulated flight hours - but now it is undergoing a radical conversion.

'Fire Scout supports both maritime and land-based  missions,
 taking off and landing on aviation-capable  warships, and at prepared 
and unprepared landing  zones in proximity to ground troops.

A scale model of the MQ-8C Fire Scout was revealed, and it is hoped the real thing could be flying this year
