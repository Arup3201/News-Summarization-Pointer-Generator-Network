Turkey keeper Volkan Demirel took things into his own hands on Sunday night after he refused to play in his nation's Euro 2016 qualifier against Kazakhstan - due to receiving abuse from fans.

Interestingly, the fixture took place at the Turk Telekom Arena - the home of Galatarasay.

The 33-year-old - No 1 for his national side - was warming up ahead of the game when it appeared a section of partisan Galatarasay fans made their feelings known to Demirel.

A fight broke out when Demirel was leaving the stadium though he remained unscathed

Large numbers of the media witnessed the fracas outside the stadium after the match

And after receiving abuse from a number of fans already, one fan appeared to take things to the next level, giving Demirel an ironic thumbs up.

That appeared to be the last straw for the Fenerbache keeper, who removed his gloves and walked off the pitch.

Basaksehir keeper Babakanm stepped up in his place, conceding one goal on the night as Turkey ran out 3-1 winners.

Leaving the ground Turkey fans expressed their dismay at the keeper's decision though, with a fight breaking out as he left the stadium, though it is not believed he was harmed in the fracas.
