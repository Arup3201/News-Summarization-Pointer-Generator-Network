Workers cut down a 60-year-old tree in a couple's garden after misreading a map and trespassing on their property.

Gary Taplin arrived home to find a pile of logs where his 30ft false acacia had been standing for six decades outside the house in Witham, Essex.

He is now planning to sue the housing association which wrongly chopped down the historic tree.

Anger: Gary Taplin arrived home to find that a 60-year-old tree in his garden had been chopped down

Attractive: The tree, circled, had stood next to Mr Taplin's home since the 1950s

It is thought that workmen were supposed to be targeting three younger trees which stand a few yards from the family's home on a patch of communal land.

But they apparently read the map wrongly and stepped over a small fence to enter Mr Taplin's private garden.

The 52-year-old engineer said: 'My wife cried because it was so shocking and upsetting.

'It was a lovely old tree. It gave us privacy and was a real feature of the house and garden. I used to prune it and look after it. It was such a shock to see it had gone.

Demolished: Workers initially cut down the tree and left the remains in Mr Taplin's garden

Error: The contractors apparently meant to cut down the trees standing on communal land, but instead stepped over a fence into Mr Taplin's garden

'I have asked for an explanation on how they got it wrong. All the trees were marked with numbers so I can't understand how they got the wrong one.

'They haven't only cut down our tree but they were trespassing by being on our land without our knowledge or permission.

'There were still tree parts in our garden nine days on - they should have been cleared away.'

Father-of-three Mr Taplin, who has lived in the house for 28years with his wife Julia, fears the value of the property will be affected by the loss of the tree, and is planning to take legal action over the blunder.

Damage: The homeowners say their garden is not the same without the majestic false acacia

Greenfields Community Housing Ltd has admitted its contractors cut the tree down by mistake and apologised to the family.

A spokesman said: 'Greenfields and our contractors have offered our sincere apologies to Mr Taplin and his family for the removal of the tree.

'We are currently working with Mr Taplin to do all we can to try to resolve the situation.'
