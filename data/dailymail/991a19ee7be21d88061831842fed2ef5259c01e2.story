Terrified: Marilyn Massie was battling cancer when a street attack left her bruised with broken bones

A thug who targeted a terminally-ill great-grandmother for her handbag ruined the last months of her life, friends said today.

Marilyn Massie, of Ashington, Northumberland, was battling cancer when a street attack at the hands of John Elliott Cram left her bruised with broken bones - and terrified to go out.

The 64-year-old retired nurse lost her fight against cancer last month on December 27, just weeks after Cram, 30, pleaded guilty to theft and left court with just a fine.

Mrs Massie’s family remain furious that she spent her final days miserable and scared because of the thief’s attack.

Family friend Debbie Ash, 46, of Ellington, Northumberland, said the mother-of-four never got over her ordeal in August, adding: ‘She spent the last few weeks of her life in total misery and total agony. She only left the house on three occasions after that before she died and that was for a hospital appointment.’

Mrs Massie was walking home from a pub at around 11pm on August 25, when she was knocked to the ground by Cram, just yards from her home in Ashington.

The thief, who approached her from behind, stole her handbag containing her phone, money and inhaler, before cycling away.

Mrs Massie was left with a broken wrist, broken nose and facial injuries.  Already undergoing chemotherapy for lung and spinal cancer, the attack came as a devastating blow to her health.

Ms Ash, who is also a nurse, said: ‘She had a smashed-up face, a broken nose, and a broken arm. She couldn’t go out the house.’

Cram, of Ashington, was arrested two weeks after the attack and charged with theft. Magistrates fined him £55 for the offence, and he was ordered to pay £85 costs and a £20 victim surcharge.

Mrs Massie - who had three sons, a stepson, 11 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren – was supported by local residents, who began raising money to buy her Christmas presents.

But by the morning of Christmas Day it became clear that Mrs Massie was dying - and it was decided that the cash should be donated to the Marie Cure Hospice, where she died.

Ms Ash added: ‘The community really rallied around for her. It’s just really, really sad.’
