It was a performance that offered a tantalising glimpse of what Chelsea might achieve this season and proved why Jose Mourinho wanted to sign him.

But as Cesc Fabregas walked off the pitch at Turf Moor on Monday night, having been involved in all three goals to cap a debut of which he could be proud, I couldn’t help think of one question — will he ever really be loved at Stamford Bridge?

Do not underestimate the impact Fabregas could have in the coming months. He is a midfielder capable of producing moments of magic and his intricate passing and link play might be the difference in propelling Chelsea to their first Barclays Premier League title since 2010.

Mourinho knew what he was getting when he asked Chelsea to pay Barcelona £30million for Fabregas’s services; a top-class operator with a proven pedigree on the biggest stage, the type who can make a difference in the games that Chelsea fell down in last year.

But Chelsea supporters knew what they were getting too — a former Arsenal player, who irritated them when he clashed with Frank Lampard. They might well respect his quality but will they afford him the same devotion that they have for Didier Drogba or John Terry? I would say that will be difficult.

And what do Arsenal fans now think of him?

When I played against Fabregas, I viewed him as one of the few young players who had the mental strength and ability to run a game. It spoke volumes that Arsene Wenger was prepared to give him such an important role so early in his career.

He enjoyed some good times, winning the FA Cup, playing in a Champions League final and captaining the side, but there won’t be any warm reception when Fabregas is reacquainted with Arsenal for the first time at Stamford Bridge on October 5.

I can understand why some players make certain moves — to be fair to Cesc, he didn’t have many top options this summer and Arsenal didn’t want him back — but, equally, I can’t understand why some jeopardise something they have worked hard to build up for a couple of years with the enemy.

Look at the example of Michael Owen. He should be idolised on The Kop after the goals he scored for Liverpool, but his subsequent spell with Manchester United means he will never be afforded the same affection as Robbie Fowler or Steven Gerrard. United fans are just as indifferent to him.

Similarly, Paul Ince helped United win their first Double in 1993-94, but three years later he was being unveiled at Anfield. You can’t be loved by two sides who have a mutual dislike for each other and Ince, who was a tremendous midfielder, is now simply viewed with scepticism by both fan-bases.

Sometimes players make decisions without considering the long-term impact. Gerrard, by contrast, took a different view. He would have lifted the title a few times had he joined Chelsea but he chose to stay at Liverpool because he knew any medals he would win would mean more.

Aside from that, he guaranteed, in my eyes, that he had a relationship with the club that went beyond medals. That is something Wayne Rooney will find out for himself during the next few years at Manchester United, where he has won almost all there is to win.

If United continue to experience difficulties, whether not winning trophies or not being in the Champions League, rather than looking to move on, Wayne would get more respect if he pulled them back to the top and lifted a trophy than if he won two or three elsewhere.

We all wonder what it is like at different clubs but I wanted to be a one club man. I loved what Paolo Maldini and Franco Baresi accomplished with AC Milan, I have tremendous respect for Gary Neville, Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes with Manchester United. I wanted to be seen in the same light.

Lots of players, though, would prefer to be more successful, earn more money and have different life experiences.

I totally accept that, but I think there are certain decisions you have to take that, while they don’t benefit you in the short-term, in the long run it proves to be the right choice.

That’s why I could never work out why Sol Campbell left Tottenham for Arsenal or the way Ashley Cole did the same to Arsenal when he joined Chelsea; they both came through the ranks at big clubs but went on to enjoy great success at their bitter rivals. But could they not have enjoyed similar success, at home or abroad, at a club that would not have caused such acrimony?

Neither of those players can go back to where it started for them and, if I’m honest, I also find it strange that Lampard has joined Manchester City for six months, even though some Chelsea fans have said they don’t begrudge him the move.

It all boils down to what order you put medals, money or respect in. Everyone is different but, at the end of your career, it is nice to know you have the affection of the fans whose club you served the longest.

By swapping red and white for blue, Cesc Fabregas may have given that up — and it remains to be seen if Chelsea followers will love him too.

Goodison treat for defender like me...

This week I’m looking forward to watching the two outstanding young English defenders go head-to-head.

I will be at Goodison Park on Saturday evening and one aspect of the game I’m relishing is how Arsenal defender Calum Chambers and Everton’s John Stones perform in a fascinating encounter.

Though the season is only two weeks old, Chambers has been Arsenal’s outstanding player. He built on the promise of his first two performances with a commanding display against Besiktas in the Champions League on Tuesday.

Chambers might only be 19, but he wasn’t ruffled by the hostile atmosphere in Turkey and that experience will stand him in good stead for what awaits him on Merseyside. Everton play good football under Roberto Martinez and Goodison remains an intimidating ground.

When Arsenal lost 3-0 to Everton in April, Romelu Lukaku bullied Arsene Wenger’s defenders and with the Belgian forward fit for the match, Chambers can be certain that he will be in for a difficult 90 minutes. It will be interesting to see how he copes.

As for Stones, I was impressed with his debut season in the Premier League.

He had to play at right-back against Leicester last week, due to Seamus Coleman’s hamstring injury.

Everton were shrewd to tie Stones, 20, down to a long-term contract this summer and if he and Chambers maintain their progression, then they could become England’s first-choice defensive pairing in the future.

Mario a bargain, if he doesn't harm team spirit

So Mario Balotelli is on the brink of joining Liverpool and completing the shock move of the summer.

When I first saw the news breaking, my initial reaction was ‘This can’t be true’; I had serious misgivings. Since then, though, I have changed my stance because of the economics — £16million for a 24-year-old who is Italy’s No 1 striker looks a great deal. If you consider Ross McCormack moved from Leeds to Fulham for £11m, it is even better value. 

And if Balotelli fails to deliver, Liverpool could expect to recoup most of their outlay. I admit he still has to convince me as a player. People talk about his behaviour off the pitch — that doesn’t worry me too much and, in truth, I think some of it is quite funny.

It is what happens when he crosses that white line that is important, and he has yet to show me he is as good as some people have claimed. We faced each other a few times when he was in England and I never saw a lot from him at Anfield. He was subbed in his three appearances there and sent off after 18 minutes as a substitute. 

There is, however, a player lurking in that frame. He has been outstanding on the two occasions he faced England at major tournaments, causing problems with his pace and power. If he’s like that, Liverpool will have done some smart business.

Daniel Sturridge will find three games a week difficult, so there will be rotation issues and how they play as a pair will be intriguing. Above all, Liverpool have a fabulous spirit under Brendan Rodgers that has carried them far. Balotelli can’t be allowed to jeopardise that.
