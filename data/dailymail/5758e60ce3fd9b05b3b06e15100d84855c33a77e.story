The thought may have occurred to Sam Robson that there has never been a better time to be an England Test specialist.

As the nation rakes over the debris of yet another World Cup fiasco, the Test squad named on Wednesday for next month’s three-match series in the Caribbean will be depicted as English cricket’s chance to start the clean-up operation.

And though the Australian-born Robson had his first taste of the big time last summer, he has not represented his adopted country since the Oval Test against India in August. Selection for the West Indies – for the first of 17 Tests in 10 months – will almost feel like starting afresh, all over again.

Robson’s quest to resume his opening partnership with Alastair Cook will face competition if Jonathan Trott is deemed ready to resume his England career following his stress-related condition. But the prize is glittering on the horizon: the chance to help win back the Ashes this summer.

‘To play in an Ashes series would be massive for me,’ Robson told Sportsmail. ‘I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t super keen. But there are five Tests before then, and I’m hoping first and foremost to play in them.’

Robson’s first challenge will be to quell the chatter about his technique and nail the only spot in the Test batting line-up that remains up for grabs. After scoring a composed century in only his second game for England, against Sri Lanka at Headingley, he began the series against India with a steady 59 at Trent Bridge. But his fortunes ebbed.

Six more Test innings brought him a top score of 37. And, as one of the few batsmen not to cash in against a mediocre Indian attack, he repeatedly found himself on the wrong end of the pundits’ analysis.

But Robson's judgement outside off stump has been questioned after dismissals caught behind and bowled

Last summer, he was caught in the cordon five times, bowled four times and lbw twice. Experts made a simple diagnosis: Robson had a flaw around off stump.

‘It is something I’m conscious of,’ he said. ‘Knowing where your off stump is as an opening batsman is crucial. I’ve worked on it just as I’ve worked on other areas of my game. But I’m not walking out there expecting never to nick another one.

‘I was a little bit disappointed not to get another big score last summer after I’d set myself a good base. But I still look back with pride on the 3-1 series win against India, and the Test hundred was something which made me feel comfortable with the environment.

‘There was a very welcoming culture in the dressing-room, which helped all the young guys coming in. After the disappointing loss to Sri Lanka, that helped us turn things round pretty quickly. I’m hungry if I get another chance to score some big runs.’

While many of the colleagues he hopes to team up with in the Caribbean have spent the last few months confirming England’s traditional struggle with 50-over cricket, Robson has been assiduously working on his game in South Africa with the ECB’s performance programme and the Lions. And he reserves special praise for the coaching of Andy Flower and Graham Thorpe.

‘I’ve always been someone who likes to hear as many views as possible, especially from guys who have played lots of Test cricket, and then apply it to my own game,’ he said. ‘In the end you’ve got to work things out for yourself.

Jonathan Trott could be ready to resume his England career, which would pile pressure on Robson's place

The 25-year-old opener has been able to learn from Andrew Strauss and Chris Rogers at Middlesex

‘Andy talks a lot about your approach to batting – how to score runs, as opposed to just technique. If he notices something technical, he’ll say it. But he doesn’t just say stuff for the sake of it. He likes to keep things simple. Graham Thorpe is the same. They spot things, but they don’t go on and on.’

Only 25, Robson has already been privileged to open with Andrew Strauss and Australia’s Chris Rogers at Middlesex, as well as Cook last summer – that’s 50 Test centuries’ worth of experience to learn from at the other end.

‘My game’s in good order,’ said Robson, who is currently in Abu Dhabi for a spot of pre-season training with Middlesex.

‘I’ve had enough cricket over the winter to work on it, and I feel refreshed. I feel ready to go and really hopeful of getting picked in the squad. I just want to get out there and do the job.’
