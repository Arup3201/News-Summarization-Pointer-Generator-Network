A 14-year-old Ohio boy playing in a rain storm was suddenly sucked into a sewer drain pipe.

Jeff LaPorta was riding his bike in Parma, Ohio on Tuesday and decided to have some fun, prancing around in some puddles in a parking lot when he accidentally fell into a creek.

He was carried 1,500 feet in the underground sewer system and was finally discovered by firefighters after 40 minutes.

Emotional rescue: Firefighters heard a cry and lifted up a manhole to find Jeff LaPorta waiting below, nearly a mile away from where he was sucked into a sewer pipe

'There were big puddles and I was splashing through them and stuff having fun,' LaPorta told ABC News.

The teenager stomped around and entered what appeared to be just a puddle, but was actually a creek.

Then suddenly, LaPorta was swept away by the water's swift currents and was sucked into a drain pipe.

The rushing waters carried him 1,500 feet from the entrance of the pipe as LaPorta struggled to keep his head above water.

'It was dark, it was scary, it was 
nasty. It was like somebody is putting you in a big whirlpool and 
spinning you around and getting your head knocked on the ground,' he 
remembered.

But the teen fought against the water and resolved to keep going.

'I was not going to give up,' he said.

The boy's friend, Miguel Torres, saw the teen get swept away and immediately flagged down help.

'I started thinking the worst,' recalled Torres.

The
local fire department was called and searched manhole after manhole, 
fervently trying to find the boy in the world below the streets.

After 40 minutes, they heard a scream from below and finally located the terrified teen.

'They lifted the manhole cover and I said, 'Hey buddy, you alright down there?'' Parma firefighter David Higginbotham said.

Firefighters frantically searched for the boy and they lifted up a manhole and heard a cry from below

LaPorta shared that during the frightening ordeal, he kept praying that he would be spared.

'In my head I’m like, ‘Thank you, Lord.' I was praying,' said LaPorta. 'I'm a little bruised up, but I’m lucky to be alive.'

The teen suffered scrapes and bruises and received six stitches.
