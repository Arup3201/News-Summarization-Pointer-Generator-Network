Gun violence in popular movies has tripled since the 1980s, according to a new study, which suggests films that were once rated R at the time of their release would be rated PG-13 today.

Films released today, such as The Hunger Games and The Avengers, contain more violence than the R-rated films of the 1980s, according to the report published Monday in the journal, Pediatrics.

Overall, violence in movies has nearly quadrupled since the 1950s.

Box office hit: The Hunger Games, starring Jennifer Lawrence, is one of the movies released today that 'contains more violence' than R rated films from the 80s

Psychologists say it’s a worrisome trend that we should take seriously, because there is evidence that watching violence on screen increases aggression in real life, according to NBC News.

‘Of course it’s not the only factor, and it may not even be the most important factor, but it isn’t a trivial factor — and it’s one we can change,’ says Brad Bushman, an Ohio State University psychologist and lead author of the new report.

The study was done on 945 of the top-grossing films released from 1950 to 2012.

Researchers found that since 2009, PG-13 movies have featured as much or more violence than the R-rated films released those same years.

And in 2012, there was more gun violence in PG-13 films than in the R-rated ones out that year.

The study looks at the Bruce Willis Die Hard sequels, such as the 1990’s Die Hard 2, which was rated R. 

But the 2007 Live Free or Die Hard, which had more gun violence and a comparable amount of overall violence, was rated PG-13.

A similar find was discovered with the Arnold Schwarzenegger Terminator movies, which shows Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines had an R rating in 2003, but it had less gun violence than 2009’s Terminator Salvation, which received a PG-13 rating.

Not so hardcore? The third installment of the Die Hard series, the 2007 Live Free Or Die Hard, also starring Willis, was rated PG-13, even though it contains more gun violence then the sequel

'I am the Terminator': Terminator 3, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, was rated R when it was released in 2003. It had less gun violence than the next film in the series, 2009's Terminator Salvation, which got a PG-13 rating

The study’s co-author, Dan Romer, 
director of the Adolescent Communication Institute at the University of 
Pennsylvania's Annenberg Public Policy Center, said the famously violent
1987 film The Untouchables has gun violence ‘comparable to a lot of the
movies we’re calling PG-13 in the last five years’.

‘I wouldn’t be surprised if The Untouchables today would get a PG-13,’ he tells NBC.

Romer thinks the same would apply to the Eddie Murphy comedy Beverly Hills Cop, which was rated R in 1984, but feels more like today’s PG-13 movies in terms of violence.

Movie ratings are determined by the Motion Picture Association of America.

'Famously violent': Sean Connery and Kevin Costner, in the R rated 1987 film, The Untouchables, which researchers say would receive a PG-13 rating if released today

Sex worse than violence? Mark Wahlberg in bed with Mila Kunis in a scene from the 2012 movie Ted, which was rated R because of a sex scene

The researchers also examined the 
content of graphic sexual scenes in the movies and found that sex was 
much more likely to earn a film an R-rating than violence would, such as
the comedy film Ted, starring Mark Wahlberg. 

‘(Sex) consistently gets an R rating if it’s at all explicit, but that’s not the case with violence,’ Romer says.

Some studies have found that the mere sight of a gun made people act with more hostility, according to NBC News, and children are the most vulnerable.

‘People tell me all the time, I watch violent media and I’ve never killed anyone. Well, big deal. So you’ve never murdered anyone. What I want to know is —how do you treat other people?’ says Bushman.
