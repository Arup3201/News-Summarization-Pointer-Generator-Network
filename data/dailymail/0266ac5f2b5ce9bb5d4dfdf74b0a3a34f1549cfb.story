The National Security Agency's Korea division chief has been charged 
with murder in the alleged beating death of his 3-year-old son who he 
and his wife adopted from Korea just months before his tragic death.

Brian
 O'Callaghan, a decorated Iraq War veteran who was awarded the Marine 
Corps Achievement Medal for his part in a gun battle that helped lead to
 the rescue of captured soldier Jessica Lynch, is accused of beating his
 adopted son, Hyunsu, so badly that he ultimately died two days after 
the alleged beating.

O'Callaghan's family, including his wife, Jennifer, say the boy's death was a tragic accident, and not murder. They say the NSA chief - who has top secret clearance with the agency - isn't capable of hurting the boy.

Accused: Brian O'Callaghan is charged with the murder of his adoptive son, who police say had injuries 'from head to toe'

Tragic: Hyunsu O'Callaghan (right), who the family calls Madoc, died of his injuries Feb. 3 at Children's National Medical Center

'He was so loving of him,' a family member told the Washington Post.

Montgomery County, Maryland, prosecutors, however, believe the boy's death was a case of cold-blooded murder.

'An absolutely horrific crime on an absolutely innocent young victim,' 
said Assistant State’s Attorney Donna Fenton, listing injuries to the 
boy’s head, neck and back. 'Basically this child was beaten to death 
from head to toe.'

O'Callaghan contends that his son's death was the result of an accidental slip the boy suffered in the shower two days before he died.

In a police interview, O'Callaghan told police that on the night of January 31, he helped the boy take a shower, noting that Madoc didn't like it when the water hit him. At the time, O'Callaghan's wife was out of town and his other son, a 7-year-old, was in a different part of the house.

'During the shower, Hyunsu was crying and upset,' 
Detective Mike Carin wrote in court papers, summarizing his conversation
 with O’Callaghan. 'After the shower had ended, Hyunsu slipped in the 
bathtub, falling backwards. As he fell, he hit his shoulder. Brian 
consoled him and he went to bed without incident.'

The following day, O'Callaghan took Madoc and his other son to to breakfast and then to a swim center, Carin wrote in his report. O'Callaghan and his sons returned home and Madoc took a nap.

According to the report, at about 4 p.m. on February 1, O'Callaghan 
went to check on Madoc during his nap. He says he noticed pink stains on
 the boy's sheets and mucus coming out of his nose.

O'Callaghan told police he changed the sheets on his son's bed and went back about an hour later to check on him again.

When
 he went back the second time, O'Callaghan noticed that the boy's 
condition had gotten worse - he was unresponsive, O'Callaghan told 
investigators, so he washed him off in a bathtub and then took him to 
the hospital. At the hospital, 'O'Callaghan could not provide an explanation' for the boy's injuries.

'These
 facts are strong, these facts are horrific, and what this man did to 
this child is murder,' Fenton, the prosecutor, said in court.

An 
autopsy revealed that Madoc had injuries consistent with having been 
beaten - he had  a 'fracture at the base of skull, bruises to 
the forehead, swelling of the brain and wounds to other parts of the 
body. There was also “blunt impact to the back from a linear and 
triangular shaped object.'

NSA: O'Callaghan currently works as a specialist on the Korean peninsula for the NSA

However, O'Callaghan's attorney, Steven McCool, said in court Tuesday that medical tests performed at the hospital don't support the findings in the autopsy.

'There was a full CT scan done of Madoc, and
 there were no skull fractures,' he said.

O'Callaghan and his wife
 had to work through Catholic Charities to qualify to adopt a child with
 special needs. Because of his honorable military background and current
 job with the NSA, in October the couple was told they could adopt 
Madoc.

'I find it impossible to believe that he’s been 
indicted for murder because he’s worked so hard to get this baby,' 
O’Callaghan’s grandfather William Rose told the paper. 'He was so loving with him. He’s been so wonderful with his other 
child. I’ve never seen him do anything that would make me believe he is 
capable of that.'

O'Callaghan has been charged with one count each of first-degree murder and child abuse resulting in death. he is being held without bond.
