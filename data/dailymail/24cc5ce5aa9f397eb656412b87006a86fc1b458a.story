Seventeen British men have been arrested in a global raid on people alleged to have used malicious software to take over computers and steal 200,000 usernames and passwords.

The worldwide investigation targeted developers and prolific users of Blackshades, a set of 'malware' tools designed to control personal computers.

According to the National Crime Agency, the tools are sold online for less than £100 and investigators believe UK users may have extracted around 200,000 usernames and passwords of victims across the world.

Among the malware tools is a remote access tool, or Rat, which enables cyber criminals to remotely take over and control operations of an infected computer.

It can be used to access a victim’s webcam, turning it on without their knowledge and taking screen shots, as well as accessing personal files and documents, and to download new content.

The Rat can also be used to infect USB devices, aiding the further spread of malware, and infect other computers via peer-to-peer communications.

Blackshades tools can also capture usernames and passwords, allowing criminals to view stolen data in a similar way to an email inbox.

Computers are typically infected when a user clicks on external links on social networking and communication platforms and instead of viewing a picture or video they unwittingly install the malware.

In many cases, those affected will have no indication they are infected.

Blackshades, and other similar software, enables cyber criminals to remotely access and seize control of a user's computer - stealing passwords and personal information as well as turning on webcams.

Once accessed, the information may be used to blackmail victims, and the software also allows users to encrypt computer data which can only be released when a ransom is paid.

The software - which can be purchased for less than £100 - is not illegal, but in many countries, including the UK, it is against the law to install it on another person's computer without their knowledge.

Typically computers are infected when users click on links on social networks or in emails which claim to lead to pictures or videos - according to the National Crime Agency.

According to the FBI, Blackshades has been purchased by thousands of people since it was created in 2010.

The 17 British men were amount 97 people in 16 countries arrested on suspicion of developing, distributing or using Blackshades.

They were arrested in Derbyshire, Birmingham, Halesowen, Wolverhampton and Newcastle-under-Lyme, Brixham in Devon, Andover in Hampshire, Ashford in Kent, Liverpool, Manchester, Warrington, Essex, St Andrews, Glasgow, Leeds, Humberside and London, the NCA said.

The cyber crime operation was carried out jointly with the FBI, and in Europe with Eurojust and Europol.

'Criminals throughout the UK and across the world are finding out that committing crimes remotely offers no protection from arrest,' said Andy Archibald, deputy director of the NCA’s National Cyber Crime Unit.

'The unique scale of this cyber operation shows what can happen when law enforcement agencies at local, national and international level work together to tackle the perpetrators and help keep people safe.

'Cyber crime is one of the most significant criminal threats to the UK. The NCA is helping to build the capacity of its partners across the country and co-ordinating the UK’s collective efforts as part of the response.

'The commitment of our police partners in the cyber arena has been clearly demonstrated by the work culminating in this week’s dramatic activity.'

Deputy Chief Constable Peter Goodman, the national policing lead on e-crime, added the operation 'demonstrates the determination of the National Crime Agency, its partners overseas and the UK’s newly-established regional cyber crime units to identify, trace and disrupt those whose potential criminal activity presents a threat to the public’s lawful use of the intranet.'
