Ukraine faced worldwide condemnation last night as ex-premier Yulia Tymoshenko was jailed for seven years for ‘abuse of office’ over a major gas contract with Russia.

Protests broke out in the capital Kiev after what was widely seen in the West as a show trial.

Mrs Tymoshenko, 50, insisted she would appeal and blamed her treatment on Viktor Yanukovych, who narrowly beat her in last year’s presidential election.

Last night there was a furious reaction from the EU, Washington and even Russia – normally a supporter of Mr Yanukovych.

EU foreign policy chief Baroness 
Ashton said she was ‘deeply disappointed’ with the verdict and warned 
that Ukraine’s plans to become part of the Union by signing a free trade
deal were now in jeopardy.

Mrs Tymoshenko is said to have 
cheated Ukraine out of £130million in a 2009 gas deal signed with 
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.

She has been ordered to repay the full amount.

Mrs Tymoshenko remained calm, but didn't 
wait for Judge Rodion Kireyev to finish reading the lengthy ruling, 
standing and addressing reporters in the courtroom as he spoke.

She compared her verdict, which she claimed was written by her longtime foe, President Viktor Yanukovych, to the horrific purges by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.

'The year 1937 has returned to Ukraine with this verdict and all the repression of citizens,' she said.

She added that she would contest the ruling, which also bans her from holding government posts for three years after she completes her sentence.

'As for me, be sure that I will not stop my fight even for a minute. I will always be with you as long as it is necessary.'

'Nobody, not Yanukovych, not Kireyev, can humiliate my honest name. I have worked and will continue to work for Ukraine's sake,' Mrs Tymoshenko told reporters earlier.

As the judge was leaving the courtroom, Mrs Tymoshenko's husband Oleksandr yelled out that his time would also come for a similar verdict. One Tymoshenko supporter shouted 'Shame!'

Mrs Tymoshenko was found guilty of 
exceeding her authority during the signing of a natural gas import 
contract with Russia in 2009.

The
court ruled that she was not authorised to order the contract signed 
and that the price she agreed to was too high, causing losses to the 
state budget.

The European 
Union was quick to condemn the verdict as politically motivated and 
urged the Ukrainian authorities to ensure a transparent and fair appeals
process for Mrs Tymoshenko.

A
failure to do so would have 'profound implications' for Ukraine-EU 
relations and could jeopardise the conclusion of a landmark association 
agreement, Baroness Ashton said in a statement.

Mrs Tymoshenko was a driving force behind the 2004 Orange Revolution, which overturned Mr Yanukovych's fraud-tainted election victory that year.

Last year, Mr Yanukovych staged a comeback, narrowly defeating his rival in a presidential vote amid public disenchantment with economic hardships and constant bickering among the political class.

Mrs Tymoshenko has already spent over two months in jail after Judge Kireyev ordered her arrested for contempt of court.

She
had also spent several weeks in prison in 2001 on charges of document 
forgery and tax evasion, but the charges were later dropped.

Mrs Tymoshenko maintains her innocence and
charges that her trial was orchestrated by Mr Yanukovych in order to 
bar her from upcoming elections.

She
says as prime minister she did not need any special permission to order
the signing of the gas deal and maintains her actions helped end a 
bitter pricing dispute between Moscow and Kiev, which had led to energy 
supply shortages across Europe.

On
Tuesday, the area outside the court building was flooded by helmeted 
riot police as supporters and opponents of Mrs Tymoshenko held competing 
rallies.

Police buses blocked traffic on Kreshchatik Avenue, which runs through the heart of the capital.

Born in November 1960, Yulia Tymoshenko shot to world prominence when she helped lead the 'Orange Revolution' street protests in Kiev in 2004-5 which doomed President Viktor Yanukovich's first bid for power.

With her peasant-style hairbraid - her political trademark - she enthralled her supporters with fiery speeches in which she portrayed herself as the saviour of Ukraine from corruption and criminality.

Mr Yanukovich, who defeated her in a presidential election in February 2010 and is her political arch-rival, has been the principal target of her invective.

Tymoshenko's fiery performance in the 'Orange Revolution' earned her the role of prime minister under Viktor Yushchenko, her ally in the protests. He became president.

Tymoshenko fell out with Mr Yushchenko and was sacked in September 2005 after less than eight months in office. She was later briefly reconciled with Mr Yushchenko and had a second spell as prime minister.

In January 2009, as prime minister, Tymoshenko brokered the 10-year gas deal with her Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, which has now led to her conviction.

The prosecution in her trial alleged she abused her power by rail-roading the state energy firm, Naftogaz, into signing a 2009 gas import agreement with Russia.

Mr Yushchenko, who has appeared as a witness at her trial, put the blame squarely on her. He says she went to Moscow to negotiate the deal by herself and then hid details of it from him.

For her part, Tymoshenko says the trial against her is a vendetta by Yanukovich aimed at neutralising her as a political force.

The United States and the European Union, which see her trial as politically motivated, have called for an end to the case against her and for her to be released.
