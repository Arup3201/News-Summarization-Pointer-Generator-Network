When Kayleigh Renwick visited the doctors with agonising back ache, she assumed she had developed a kidney infection.

But just six hours later she was giving birth in hospital.

Unbeknown to the 24-year-old nursery nurse, from Stanley, County Durham, already a mum to daughter Grace, she was five weeks overdue.

Kayleigh Renwick visited an out-of-hours medical centre suffering from back ache - only to be told she was pregnant. Just hours later, Kayleigh gave birth to baby Lucy five weeks overdue, weighing 7lb 7oz

Ms Renwick said she had not realised she was pregnant because she continued to have periods throughout her pregnancy and bizarrely had actually lost weight - dropping from a size 16 to a size 12 -14.

She said: 'You read about women not realising they were pregnant and think ‘how did you not know?’. I had no pram, no cot, nothing.

'I’d given it all away after Grace as was adamant we weren’t going to have another baby.'

Kayleigh, from Stanley, County Durham, felt pains in her back when she visited the park with her parter Daniel Madge and their two year-old daughter Grace in May this year.

At first she thought her back ache was caused by a kidney infection and visited an out-of-hours medical centre for medication.

Ms Renwick said she had not realised she was pregnant because she continued to have periods throughout her pregnancy and bizarrely, had actually lost weight

But as she awaited the results of a routine urine test, a doctor asked her 'how far into your pregnancy are you?'

She said she wasn’t pregnant, but was sent to the University Hospital of North Durham for a scan.

She said: 'Just after 6pm I was seeing a doctor and by 7.30pm I was at the maternity ward having a scan.

'If they’d said I was four months pregnant I could have got my head around that but they said 'it’s good news, there’s a baby there and you’re 8cm dilated.'

'I couldn’t believe it. My body went into shock and I started throwing up. I had periods throughout the pregnancy and in February was sick a couple of times so did a pregnancy test and it came back negative. There were just no further symptoms.'

Lucy was born weighing 7lb 7ozs with very dry, cracked skin.

Midwives told Kayleigh when they’d delivered her placenta it had stopped working.

Kayleigh said: 'They didn’t know what Lucy had been surviving on and thought she was up to five weeks overdue.

'She was back-to-back and they think tucked behind my pelvis which is why I was getting the back ache.

'Grace has been brilliant with Lucy, it’s like she’s always been here.'

Now six-months-old Lucy has been diagnosed with severe Brachycephaly and Plagiocephaly, commonly known as Flat Head Syndrome (FHS), causing her head to misshapen.

While a baby’s sleeping position is the main cause of mild FHS other causes include factors in the womb such as a lack of amniotic fluid and the position of the baby.

Kayleigh now has to raise £2,000 for a cranial helmet which will re-shape Lucy’s head and is also incurring costs for the family having to travel weekly to a clinic in Leeds specialising in her condition.

Treatment for the condition is not available on the NHS as it is classed as a cosmetic problem.

Kayleigh said: 'It wasn’t until I took Lucy to the doctor that anyone showed any concern for the shape of her head but it was clear just to look at her it was flat.

'We were referred to a consultant who told us Lucy had Plagiocephaly but because the condition is cosmetic there was little the NHS can do.

'You could see straight away her head was misshapen and we didn’t want Lucy to have to grow up with this. Children can be so cruel and I didn’t want that for my little girl.

'I went to the hospital hoping they’d help. If the NHS can fund boob jobs and gastric bands, why can’t they fund a child in need?

FHS occurs when a baby’s soft skull bones are subjected to abnormal or prolonged pressure and the baby develops a misshapen head.

While Plagiocephaly refers to flatness at the sides of the head, Lucy also has brachycephaly which is flatness at the back of the head. 

Both conditions can cause changes to a baby’s facial features such as ears and eyes not being aligned and, as with Lucy, their forehead jutting out more than it normally would.

Lucy will have to wear the helmet 23 hours a day with the possibility of blisters on her head during the first seven weeks. Kayleigh will need to travel to Leeds every week at a cost of £116 a time for six weeks and then every fortnight after that so Lucy’s progress can be monitored.
