The government has ordered a national inquiry into claims of horrific abuse in the sheep shearing industry after undercover animal rights investigators filmed shearers punching, kicking and throwing sheep as they shear them.

Animal rights group the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animal (PETA) released the vision on Thursday, which they claim was taken in shearing sheds across NSW, Victoria and South Australia between August 2013 and March 2014.

The shearers were captured stamping on the heads and necks of sheep when the animals appeared to panic and also shown throwing the sheep around and slamming their heads and bodies against hard wooden floors.

One shearer was even filmed hitting a sheep in the head with a hammer.

A spokesperson for the Department of Agriculture told MailOnline that they are 'confident that this matter will be investigated appropriately'.

'We understand PETA has submitted the footage to the relevant state authorities for investigation, including the RSPCA,' they said.

The investigation comes as Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce questioned the ethics of PETA investigators who obtained footage.

Mr Joyce told the ABC: 'One of the questions I ask is with the up close shot of the man hitting the sheep, which is obviously exceptional and cruel and in many instances would be immediate dismissal, where exactly was the camera?

'Did the person know that they were filmed? Were they actually part of process? There are lots of questions that need to be asked.'

But PETA hit back at Mr Joyce's comments, explaining that some of the shearers committing the abuse knew that they were being filmed.

Claire Fryer, from PETA Australia, told MailOnline on Friday: 'Some of the footage was filmed openly and many of the shearers were aware they were being filmed.'

Three PETA US investigators went undercover in 19 shearing sheds across the country and claim to have witnessed attacks by 70 workers, which often left the animals bleeding from their eyes, noses and mouths.

Ms Fryer said PETA US managed to obtain the footage when investigators got jobs at the shearing sheds through farmers or contractors.

'The investigators got jobs at the sheds but for their safety we are unable to go into what jobs they were,' she said.

'The concern should be that of all the 19 sheds seen by investigators, they all showed examples of cruelty.'

Greens NSW senator Lee Rhiannon has also slammed Mr Joyce's comments and called for a police investigation into the footage.

'Mr Joyce as the Agriculture Minister doesn't do justice to the farming communities who share concerns of cruelty to animals,' she told MailOnline.

'He should take a more responsible position and speak up for farming communities about the abuse,' she reasoned.

Ms Rhiannon said the RSPCA and the police should look into the cruelty and 'laws should be enacted'.

'These incidents of cruelty clearly need to be investigated,' she said.

The Department of Agriculture spokesperson explained: 'We do not condone the mistreatment of animals. The department believes that the wool industry would also not condone the mistreatment of animals.

'The wool industry, through the industry services body, Australian Wool Innovation, invests significant funding to help promote good animal welfare outcomes. This includes good wool handling and shearing practices.'

Shocking footage was released in 2011 by Animals Australia showing the sever mistreatment of animals being exported to Indonesia

Following its release live exports were banned for nearly a month by the Australian government

Wool Producers Australia (WPA) president Geoff Fisken said the actions of shearers in the video was 'unacceptable and unsupportable', according to Stock & Land.

Mr Fisken added the footage showed isolated incidents by a few shearers.

'We’re sure it doesn’t portray the 99.9 per cent majority of wool shearers and those shearers would be appalled by it as well,' he said.

'Woolgrowers condemn this treatment of animals; we’re not in the business of treating animals like that and nor are shearers.

'We want that type of behaviour to be removed from shearing sheds in Australia.'

The RSPCA said the allegations made public by PETA were serious.

'The allegations are serious and will be investigated by RSPCA Inspectors as information comes to hand for potential breaches of the relevant state animal welfare legislation,' a spokeswoman said.

Outcry has also come in the US over the footage which shows the same treatment of animals in American ranches.

Despite not having seen the footage, a representative of the main U.S. wool industry trade group, the American Wool Council, told NBC News the behavior described by PETA was 'unacceptable.'

'We do not condone or support the actions of anyone that results in the abuse of sheep either intentionally or unintentionally,' Rita Samuelson told the website.

'Rough handling of animals that might result in the injury of a sheep is an unacceptable maneuver during the shearing process or anytime when sheep are handled.'

The shearers were captured violently beating sheep and jabbing them in the head with sharp metal clippers and even a hammer

The animals were given no painkillers  before shearers used needles to sew gaping, bloody wounds caused by the shearing

In 2011 animal cruelty in the live export industry was put under the microscope after footage released by Animals Australia showed cattle being inhumanely slaughtered in Australian centres in Indonesia.

This prompted a national and international outcry, and live exports to Indonesia were suspended for just under a  month, from June 7 to July 6 2011.

Following this, the Australian government were forced to put in place stronger safeguards to ensure the well being of all animals leaving Australia, but animal rights groups argue the situation has not improved.

Following the more recent footage released on Thursday, The PETA investigators claim farmers put tight rings on some lambs' scrotums with anaesthetics to castrate them, but when that failed shearers would just cut off their testicles with shears.

The animals were also deprived of food and water before being sheared so they were too weak to fight, they claim.

Footage shows the shearers violently beating sheep and jabbing them in the head with sharp metal clippers and even a hammer.

Activists claim no painkillers were administered to the sheep before shearers used needles to sew gaping, bloody wounds caused by the shearing.

'Sheep are very gentle animals. Most of the sheep weren’t resisting in any way so it would have been especially frightening for them,' Ms Fryer said. 

'I think it’s extremely shocking. Sheep are very gentle animals. They show fear if they’re on their own.

'It’s devastating and no compassionate person could watch that footage and not be horrified.'

The footage was released by PETA in a new campaign targeting the Australian wool industry.

Mr Fisken said $2.8 million had been spent by WPA in the last year to train shearers to prevent injury or cruelty.

'There will be a fair bit of attention focused on the industry now and we’re disappointed because we’ve come a long way in the last 10 years with animal welfare standards and we’re continuing to put a lot of resources into that area of our business; it’s a high priority,' he said.

He added that WPA would never make PETA happy because the activists wanted them to stop farming all together.

'But we have standards and they're the same as they are for how people treat their family pet,' he said.

Overnight, the RSPCA received cruelty complaints from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) regarding the alleged ill treatment of sheep during shearing in New South Wales and South Australia between August 2013 and March 2014.

The allegations relate to workers beating, kicking and stomping on sheep, and stitching wounds without anaesthetic.

The vision made publicly available by PETA overnight shows sheep being beaten with shearing hand pieces and thrown down a chute. 

Sheep that had been injured during shearing are roughly stitched up.

RSPCA notes that shearing is stressful for sheep and it should be carried out by trained and competent workers. 

The allegations are serious and will be investigated by RSPCA Inspectors as information comes to hand for potential breaches of the relevant state animal welfare legislation.
