Commemorating the atrocities committed by the Nazis is usually a sombre duty, not a cause for joy.

But at the Miss Holocaust Survivor Beauty Pageant, the emphasis is firmly on celebrating the remarkable women who survived the genocide of the Jews.

The 16 contestants at the event in Israel, all aged over 70, showed off their mature beauty as they competed to take the crown as the nation's most striking senior citizen.

Line-up: A total of 16 women, all aged over 70, entered the second edition of the annual contest

The pageant, held in the town of Haifa, was held for the second time on Thursday, following on from the success of last year's inaugural edition.

It is organised by the International Christian Embassy, an evangelical group that supports Israel, in collaboration with a charity for Holocaust survivors.

The aim is to boost the self-esteem of the women involved by bringing a touch of glamour to their lives.

While the contestants are certainly encouraged to look their best in sparkling ballgowns, officials say the event is meant to celebrate inner beauty as well.

Many of the women are now fairly infirm, and have little opportunity to dress up at formal events.In the run-up to the event, the 16 finalists were given the use of make-up artists and hairdressers.

The winner of this year's pageant was Shoshana Colmer, 93, who was brought up in Czechoslovakia before being imprisoned in Auschwitz.

She still bears the identity number which was branded on her skin by the Nazis, and during the contest she told a story about how she would sing for a guard in order to secure extra rations of bread.

Since moving to Israel, she has not always been free of troubles - in 2006, her house near the border with Lebanon was destroyed by a rocket fired by jihadist group Hezbollah.

While the women involved seemed delighted to have been invited to the pageant, not everyone is so positive.

Critics claim the pageant exploits vulnerable elderly people by putting them on show for entertainment.

'I'm not sure I'm happy with this beauty pageant because pageants objectify women and also because there is a sensational dimension,' Dalia Sivan, of Holocaust survivors' charity of Amcha, told USA Today. 'The survivors' suffering is on display in a very public way.'
