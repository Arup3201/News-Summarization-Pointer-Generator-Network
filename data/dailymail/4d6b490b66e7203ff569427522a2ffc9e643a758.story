Diego Costa's proposed transfer to Chelsea will have excited many fans before the World Cup. But after some dismal displays for Spain, some may be hoping Jose Mourinho has a change of heart.

Samuel Eto'o and Fernando Torres were criticised for their lack of potency all season, and for their lack of desire to break into the box.

But with the world champions crashed out of the tournament in Brazil, Costa barely tried to influence play against the brave Chileans.

Flopped: Diego Costa failed to inspire Spain as they were dumped out of the World Cup by Chile

Not in the game: Costa has had five shots in the tournament but is yet to hit the target

Embarrassing: Costa is replaced by Chelsea flop Torres... will Diego be the next one?

Costa was praised after a fine campaign with Atletico Madrid for his all-action style, creating and scoring chances out of nothing, displaying some of the raw power Didier Drogba showed during his legendary stint at Stamford Bridge.

Mourinho has admitted that Costa was the star striker he was after this summer, with Eto'o and Torres grabbing a total of 14 goals between them in the Premier League last season.

The World Cup was his chance to show what he was all about. But after zero shots on target and just 21 touches so far in the tournament, his reputation could begin to slide.

With Brazil crying out for a dominant centre forward, Costa may regret not making the decision to ply for his home country, instead of figuring in Spain's tiki-taka system which is out of date, and out of ideas. In fairness to the target man, it simply doesn't suit his style.

Mourinho has a habit of getting the best out of players like Costa, and while his confidence may be restored quickly upon returning from South America, English football demands more of an impact for a £32million rated star.
