More than a third of bus stops used by the UK's main coach operator cannot accommodate wheelchair users - despite National Express specifically altering its fleet in order to carry them.

National Express, the country's largest coach operator, stops at almost 1,200 bus stops across the country.

But of those 436 bus stops - 37 per cent - have so many restrictions in place that coach drivers are prevented from using their lifts to let wheelchair users on and off the bus.

The Department for Work and Pensions say as a result many disabled people are left unable to use the coaches - despite National Express and many other coach companies investing in the new, accessible buses. 

The majority of bus and coach stations and bus stops are owned by local authorities, which have a legal responsibility to comply with the Equality Act by making reasonable adjustments for disabled travellers. 

Now the minister for disabled people, Mark Harper, is leading calls for councils to make bus stations and stops more accessible to disabled travellers.

He said: 'It is simply unacceptable that in the 21st century more is not being done to make coach stations and stops more accessible to disabled travellers.

'There is little point in making sure buses themselves are accessible, if those who operate the places where people are collected from are not doing what they can to help.

'This isn't just about doing what's right, it's also about recognising the business case – as disabled people and their households have an annual spending power of £200 billion.'

All of National Express' 550 vehicles are wheelchair accessible – meaning they can carry wheelchair users at the front of their coaches. 

National Express managing director Tom Stables said: 'We carry millions of passengers every year and are absolutely committed to getting people where they want to go, whatever their circumstances.' 

'We passionately believe everyone has the right to travel  - that's why we were the first coach company to introduce a wheelchair lift. 

'While we're really proud of our accessibility record, we still believe there's a long way to go in the field of accessible travel.

'We've worked with partners and lobbied to make third-party stations and bus stops more accessible for years and while the situation has improved, over a third of stops are still not accessible to wheelchair users. 

'We hope that with the backing of the government that more station and bus stop owners will listen and take action in this crucial area.'

The government has welcomed statistics, which show 84 per cent of buses and coaches in England meet new regulations that make them properly accessible to disabled people – ahead of a deadline by 2020

Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said: 'It is unacceptable if disabled people are unable to take advantage of a service that is there to provide for everyone.

'Access to public transport has a massive impact on people's quality of life.

'We have made progress but I am determined to do more. 

'This government has given £600 million to local sustainable transport projects, many of which contain measures to improve accessibility and in 2012 we published an action plan to drive improvements across the transport network.'

National Express coaches all have a lift which requires a clear space for a three-metre extension from the side of the coach to allow a wheelchair to be lifted aboard. 

In many stations or bus stops furniture and objects which overhang mean wheelchair users who are hoping to travel are left unable to board.

The government has said it welcomes latest statistics, which show 84 per cent of buses and coaches in England meet new regulations that make them properly accessible to disabled people – ahead of a deadline by 2020. 

Almost all of London's 8,500 buses are now fully low-floor accessible to wheelchair users.
