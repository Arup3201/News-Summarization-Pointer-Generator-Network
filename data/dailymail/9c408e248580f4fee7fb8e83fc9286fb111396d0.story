Lopez's arrest was made at 2:30pm in the 94th Precinct, police said. The precinct is also located in Williamsburg.

Lopez faces 2 felony assault charges, a reckless endangerment charge, as well as a criminal possession of a weapon charge, police told Daily Mail Online.

The Brooklyn DA's Office said in a criminal complaint obtained by DNAInfo, which earlier reported on the story, that  over 180 stitches were required for Rene's face, abdomen, arm and part of his ear.

Rene's ear had to get an unspecified amount, though his stomach and arm each had to get 30 stitches and his face had to get 120 stitches, according to the website.

The website pointed out that Guercio posted a photo of a bandaged Rene on Instagram Sunday, writing 'London was just sliced in the face @ Club OUTPUT in Brooklyn. In ER, Wood hull hospital getting over 250 in stitches @MobWives @VH1.'

MailOnline earlier reported that Guercio tweeted about the incident. In one post she wrote: 'London was just sliced in teh face @ClubOUTPUT in Brooklyn. In ER.'

Later she added: 'Please pray for him' and 'Thank you for ur prayers we are heading to Hackensack medical center to have plastic surgeon stitch him.'

Mark Scotto, the lawyer representing Lopez, said in a statement to DNAInfo people 'should not rush to judgement.'

The attorney also said that 'There is much, much more to this case than what has been reported in the news and broadcast over social media. This case will be handled in the courtroom by lawyers, not on Twitter or Instagram.'

Scotto did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Daily Mail Online.

VH1 describes 'Mob Wives' on its website as 'a docu-soap series which follows the lives of a group of ("according to the federal government") associated women at a crossroads, struggling to establish their own identities and carry on while their loved ones do time for Mob-related activities.'
