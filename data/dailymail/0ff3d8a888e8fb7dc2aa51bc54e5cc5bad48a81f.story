Sentenced to die: If the execution proceeds as scheduled, Michelle Byrom (pictured) will be the first woman to be killed by lethal injection in Mississippi since 1944

A woman accused of murdering her husband is set to be the first female execution in Mississippi in 70 years even though her son has confessed to the killing four times.

Michelle Byrom is scheduled to be executed on Thursday for the 1999 murder of her husband after prosecutors struck deals with her son who admitted to pulling the trigger and the man she allegedly hired to arrange the murder.

Her husband Edward Byrom Sr was killed by a gunshot in his Iuka, Mississippi home in 1999 and state prosecutors made the case that she arranged to have him killed while she was in the hospital.

Her son Edward Byrom Jr. has since confessed to killing his father in a fit of rage after his dad called him a 'b******, no good, mistake and telling me I'm inconciderate (sic) and just care about my self,' according to CNN.

He made the confessions in letters riddled with spelling mistakes that he sent to her while she was in jail.

'He slaps me, then goes back to his room. As I sat on my bed, tears of rage flowing, remembering my childhood, my anger kept building and building,' her son wrote in one letter.

The Jackson Free Press tells how the Tishomingo County sheriff's office decided to arrest 'Junior' for his connection to the murder-for-hire plot but they did not give him the most extreme charge.

Even though he led authorities to the murder weapon and was the only one with gunpowder residue on his hands after the June 4, 1999 shooting, they argued that his mother was the mastermind behind the plot.

Junior, whose age at the time was unreported, testified against his mother in exchange for a lighter sentence.

He told investigators how she was going to pay his friend Joey Gillis $15,000 once she was granted access to her husband's life insurance policy if Gillis would be the one to kill him.

'When they got me here, I gave them a bulls*** story after another, trying to save my own ass, but when (Tishomingo County Sheriff) David Smith started questioning me, and told me what happened, I was so scared, confused, and high, I just started spitting the first thought out, which turned in to this big conspiracy thing, for money, which was all BS, that's why I had so many different stories,' Junior wrote in one of the three confessional letters ot his mother.

Her advocates described Michelle as being a victim of both domestic violence and sex abuse, starting when she was a child and her stepfather allegedly forced her into prostitution and continuing when she started her relationship with Edward Byrom Sr when she was only 16 and he was 31.

The Jackson Free Press reports that he abused her throughout their relationship and videotaped her when he forced her to have sex with other men.

Their son, Junior, was born three years after they first got together and they married when the boy was 5-years-old.

With his birth, Byrom Sr got a new target for his abuse.

'(I) was fixing to go to bed when my dad 
came in, and said, "What do you think your [sic] doing coming in at this
 time?" and before I could answer, he shoves me down, and my back hits 
the book shelf, and I begin to get up, and he grabs me and slaps me 
twice, and says, 'You were a f****** mistake to begin with!' and shuts 
my door and leaves... He was always like that,' Junior wrote in one 
letter.

Time running out: Michelle, who is now 56, has had a number of appeals but critical evidence- like her son's confessions- were not allowed to be taken into account

Michelle tried to leave her husband but he threatened her and beat her more. She developed unspecified mental disorders, and in the days leading up to his murder she tried to kill herself by ingesting poison.

'It just hasn't seem to gotten through that people in horribly abusive situations are doing things that don't look reasonable, like taking rat poison so she can stay in the hospital and get some temporary relief from the situation,' Warren Yoder from the Public Policy Center of Mississippi told the paper.

'That's not a strategy that looks reasonable, (but in the hospital) nobody's actually abusing her right this minute.'

Police questioned her about the murder while she was on prescribed medication and she did not confess. Only later at the police station when the detective said that her son had confessed and she should protect him did she repeat exactly what the detective told her about her son's confession.

Multiple appeals have ruled with the original conviction as a result of key evidence- like the letters from her son and his original confession- being kept out of the trial as a result of specific legal wrangling.

'The majority of Mississippians support the death penalty because they think that people get fair trials and they think that they have competent attorneys representing them,' former state Supreme Court Justice Oliver Diaz Jr told CNN.

'In this case, she didn't have either one.'

The only person who can commute the death sentence is the Governor of Mississippi, Phil Bryant.
