A new ‘legal high’ is hitting Britain’s streets every week, drug experts warned last night - as they called for the ban of another danger drug.

The Government’s drug advisory body urged ministers to outlaw a substance sold as ‘Annihiliation’ which is available legally on Britain’s streets.

The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs is set to issue advice for ministers that use of the drug be made unlawful.

Currently it is marketed as a ‘herbal incense’ and sold widely in high street ‘head shops’ and online.

Ministers are thought likely to accept the recommendation and order a ban within weeks.

Police in Glasgow have warned that the drug has left nine people in hospital in the last three months.

And last month a 15-year old boy was hospitalised after taking the drug, which he had bought from a high-street shop.

The drug is also known as Mary Joy Pink, K2, Warning and Review. It sells for 1g for £10 and 3g for £20 and is widely available online.

Designed to mimic the effects of cannabis, it can lead to paranoia, aggression and an increased heart rate.

Users have also been found to self-harm after taking the drug, suffer numbness in their legs and been left unconscious.

ACMD chairman Professor Les Iversen told a meeting in central London: ‘Annihilation is a relatively new substance and product and the evidence for its prevalence and harms is still very preliminary.

‘However, there have been reports, particularly from Glasgow, of young people reacting very unfavourably to this product, becoming severely agitated and over-stimulated.’

Prof Iversen described Annihilation as ‘particularly potent’ and said its arrival showed just how fast-moving the legal high market had become in recent years.

'He was in a very bad way in hospital. He was hallucinating, was having heart palpitations, and he thought his skin was on fire'

A 15-year-old from Darwen in Lancashire had to be hospitalised last month after he collapsed after taking just one hit of the drug, which he bought from a high street head shop in Blackburn.

The drug is labelled as a ‘herbal incense’ but packaging features featuring an image of an atom bomb explosion on the packet, is smoked like cannabis.

His mother, who was not named, said: ‘He was in a very bad way in hospital. He was hallucinating, was having heart palpitations, and he thought his skin was on fire.’

She said: ‘I got a call from the police saying I had to come to the hospital. He was vacant and dizzy and looked frightened to death.’

Medical student: Hester Stewart died in 2009 after taking a legal high called GBL, and her mother Maryon said: 'There were 49 new substances last year and there are even more this year'

Maryon Stewart, whose medical student daughter Hester died after taking a legal high called GBL, said: ‘There were 49 new substances last year and there are even more this year.

‘Kids are putting themselves in danger without even realising it.

Mrs Stewart, whose Angelus Foundation will next week launch a nationwide campaign warning of the dangers of legal highs, added: ‘They are called legal highs which implies they are safe but that’s really not right.’

The ACMD also warned of the growing trend for inhaling nitrous oxide - also known as laughing gas - and helium.

Breathing in both gases was ‘potentially lethal’ Prof Iversen said. Deaths from helium inhalation have risen from just two in 2007 to 42 last year.

Prof Iversen said: ‘It is quite easy to open a canister and fill a balloon - for example, at Glastonbury music festival a couple of years ago there were lots of yellow balloons containing nitrous oxide which were being sold and inhaled from the balloons.'
