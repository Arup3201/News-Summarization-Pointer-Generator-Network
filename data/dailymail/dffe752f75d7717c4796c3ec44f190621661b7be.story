A gang of kidnappers has executed a tourist in a restaurant and abducted three others in the ancient Mali city of Timbuktu.

Two of the hostages are Dutch and the third a South African who may have lived in the UK, say reports. The nationalities have not been confirmed.

The dead man, a German, was shot dead after refusing to climb into the gang's truck.

His death by the suspected local chapter of al-Qaeda come less than 24 hours after two French geologists were seized by gunman in the eastern village of Hombori.

UK citizens have already been warned not to travel to northern Mali because of the threat and today city authorities have ordered a plane to evacuate all foreigners from Timbuktu.

They will be taken to the capital of Bamako, according to the owner of the hotel where the three abducted men and their dead friend were staying as they toured the country.

The Timbuktu gunmen burst in as the men were dining at the Amanar restaurant in the central square.

They ordered the tourists to follow them and the German was shot dead when he resisted.

French soldiers have joined Mali's army in the hunt for the French hostages, according to AFP.

The pair - named as Philippe Verdon and Serge Lazarevic - were the first Westerners in Mali to be kidnapped south of the River Niger.

They had been sent by the company Mande Construction Immobiliere to take soil samples in the Hombori region where it planned to build a cement factory.

Neither abductions has yet been claimed 
by al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, (or Aqim) whose members have 
kidnapped and ransomed more than 50 Europeans and Canadians since 2003.

Large areas of the country are now off-limits to foreigners and the Foreign Office website warns there is a 'high threat from terrorism' in Mali.
