Determined: Software engineer Fran Bunce, 28, has sold all of her possessions in order to raise the deposit to buy a house

A young mother has finally raised enough money to buy her first home - after selling everything she owns.

Software engineer Fran Bunce was desperate to get on the property ladder but was unable to scrape together a deposit.

So the 28-year-old decided to sell everything she owned to raise the  £5,000 she needed.

Items sold by the mother-of-one included a motorbike, sofa, bed, mirrors, fridge-freezer, light fittings, dining room table, cushions and dishwasher.

She even parted with her clothes, jewellery and vast collection of shoes - while her nine-year-old daughter Summer, nine, sold her toys and games.

Miss Bunce used websites Gumtree and eBay, newspaper classified ads and car boot sales to flog all her worldly goods.

Miss Bunce, of Bath, Somerset, said she was delighted to buy the house - but is now living in an 'empty shell' after selling everything.

She said: 'It came to that time when I needed to buy my own house, I’ve always wanted to own a home, I want to provide a bit of stability.

'But I realised I couldn’t really afford it unless I sold my own stuff for a deposit. I’m one of those people that once I set my mind to it I will do whatever it takes to get there.

'If I have to sacrifice those things then I will. I sold everything I owned, from my motorbike, sofa, clothes and shoes. I even sold creams and oils I haven’t used.

'I have sold whatever there is you can sell, you wouldn’t believe it. I had friends messaging me asking if I was selling my whole life.

'I’m over the moon to have finally done it, but I’ve been left in a bit of an empty shell now. I’ve got a mattress on the floor and my daughter’s got her bed and that’s about it.'

Miss Bunce decided to sell her possessions in January this year after she worked out she could halve her monthly outgoings if she bought a house.

She currently pays £900-a-month in rent, with bills on top, and calculated that mortgage payments would be much less.

She sold many of her items to complete strangers and managed to negotiate prices with fellow tenants for white goods like her fridge-freezer and dishwasher.

Miss Bunce also parted with many of her prized possessions, including precious jewellery and ornaments, and sold most of her vast collection of shoes.

She sold each of her 30 pairs for £10, and raised £300 towards her total.

Miss Bunce even retrained as a beautician so she could work evenings and weekends.

She
 said: 'The way I see it is I pay £900 a month on rent with bills on top
 and if I move into a house my mortgage would be half of that.

'At
 the moment things are really tight because we are paying and saving, 
when we move into our new house we will have so much more money.

'I can start enjoying days out and 
holidays and stuff. I can start enjoying life with my daughter again. 
She has sacrificed so much.

'I
 sold my clothes, stuff I don’t wear any more. For years I haven’t 
changed size so I sold what I didn’t wear. I got quite a lot for them 
and I’m still selling some.

'Same with my shoes. I was just hoarding stuff I didn’t really need.

'The
 only downside is that I didn’t get half as much as what they were worth
 but you just want to make sure you can get what you can.'

Miss Bunce is now living in an 'empty shell' after selling everything, including this red jacket and the cabinet

Miss Bunce recently queued up with her mother for 20 hours at a store in Bath, during a recent sale, to buy some new furniture.

She managed to buy a bed, worth £750, for just £200, and a sofa, worth £1,000, for a mere £500.

Miss Bunce
 added: 'I have managed to still save money, I sold my sofa for £700 and
 bought another one for £500, I’ve got £200 in my pocket still.

'I have sold everything, but I’ve worked it all out, I know what will fit where and what I needed to get rid of.'

Miss Bunce hopes to be living in the new home within a month.
