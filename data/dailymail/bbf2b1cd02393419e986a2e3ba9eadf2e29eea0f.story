A grandmother-of-six has become Britain’s oldest bridesmaid after she followed her daughter down the aisle - aged 97-years-old.

Proud Edna Houghton was delighted to accept the roll of matron of honour at the wedding of her daughter Maureen Grogan, 69.

Maureen tied the knot to fiance Duncan McKerracher-Taylor, 86, at the moving ceremony at the Grade II listed Pump Rooms, in Tenbury Wells, Worcs.

Plucky Edna fulfiled her duties by walking down the aisle with Maureen to stand by her side as she wed her new son-in-law.

But she drew the line on trying to catch the bouquet of flowers at the wedding reception afterwards.

Maureen
 - who met Duncan seven years ago through a dating agency - said she 
planned her big day in under a month so as to hold it on the same day as
 her parents wedding on May 23, 1942.

Yesterday Maureen, from Tenbury Wells, said her mum was 'the life and soul of the party' and an essential part of her wedding.

She said: 'I’ve always been incredibly close with my mum.

'So when Duncan proposed I knew the only person I wanted as my matron of honour was her.

'When I told mum we got engaged her face lit up. She was just so happy to see me happy.

'When I asked her she just laughed and said, ‘Oh Maureen you are a fool. How could I be your bridesmaid?’

The wedding was attended by four generations of Maureen's family including mother Edna, daughter Samantha Stacey, 30, and grandson William, six

'But she was joking and when I overheard her talking to her friends she was bragging about being in the wedding.

'She was so excited and happy for me.'

The intimate ceremony with just 20 guests was attended by four generations of Maureen’s family including mother Edna, daughter Samantha Stacey, 30, and grandson William, six.

Maureen’s father George passed away in 1997, but Edna has remained dedicated to his memory and a picture of him was included in his daughter’s wedding.

The group continued celebrating at a reception, which was held at the Peacock Inn in Knighton-On-Teme, Worcs.

Mother-of-six Maureen, who divorced her previous husband 12 years ago, added: 'Mum loves to dance and she’s the heart and soul of the party.

Maureen and Duncan planned their big day in under a month so as to hold it on the same day as her parents wedding on May 23, 1942

'She’s such a special woman and anytime you ask her how she is she says, "I’m on top of the world of course."

'I know that’s how she feels today.'

Edna and George met in Handsworth, Birmingham where they both were working at an ammunition factory.

After a whirlwind romance they were married at a small, local church in the spring of 1942.

Edna fell pregnant with Maureen and the couple then moved to the picturesque village of Wythall, Worcs.

Maureen, who works as a carer, added: 'I had a very happy childhood.

'I was brought up in the country by very attentive parents.

'We were always together and loved playing cricket or rounders.

'Mum was a caretaker at the local village school and dad worked as a guns inspector.

'They loved each other so much and you could always see the bond they shared.

'I
 was an only child so I was very close with my parents. Mum is my best 
friend. That’s why it was so important to me to have her in my wedding.'

Groom Duncan, a retired pharmacy director at Boots, where he worked for 42 years, said: 'It has been the best day of my life and we are looking forward to having a happy life together as a married couple.

'We are going to Italy for our honeymoon, I hope we prove that you're never too old to get married and fall in love.

'Edna looked beautiful and every elegant, she did brilliantly and I'm so delighted she could here with us to celebrate our special day.'

Edna added: 'I love my daughter very much and I have had the best day ever. I just want to do it all again now, it was just so beautiful.

'Nothing makes me happier than seeing my daughter look so happy and in love. It was been truly wonderful - God bless her.'
