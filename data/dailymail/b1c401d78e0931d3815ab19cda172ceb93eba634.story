Andy Murray's fourth-round opponent Kevin Anderson has been practising with his former coach Ivan Lendl - but the Scot is confident Lendl will not have spilled any secrets.

Reigning champion Murray, 27, plays South African Anderson on Monday for a place in the quarter-finals. Anderson has an American wife, Kelsey, and lives in Florida. He met Lendl by chance at the Crandon Park tennis club in Key Biscayne and the pair spent time on court together.

Lendl was Murray's coach from the end of 2011 until March this year and helped him finally win a Grand Slam - guiding him to the US Open title in 2012, the Wimbledon title last year and Olympic gold.

Upbeat: Andy Murray has breezed through his first three matches against low-ranked small fry

'Ivan loves playing tennis, he hits balls all the time when he is over in Miami,' said Murray of Lendl and Anderson meeting up. 'That doesn't surprise me in the slightest.'

Murray lost four Slam finals before finally winning his first. Lendl also lost four Slam finals before winning the first of eight he won in his career. He gave the Wimbledon champion valuable insight into how to become a winner. 

Murray insists that Lendl hitting with Anderson won't have helped  him. 'You can't compare practising with Ivan to playing against me, it's completely different,' he said.

The journey towards a second straight Wimbledon title takes Murray into the land of giants this week - literally and figuratively. 

He has breezed through his first three matches against low-ranked small fry with straight-sets wins taking a total of five hours. 

On Monday he will see the gradient of the challenge rise steeply, facing 6ft 8in Anderson, the world No 18. And if he clears that hurdle, Bulgaria's dangerous world No 13 Grigor Dimitrov will probably await in the quarter-final, followed by world No 2 Novak Djokovic and world No 1 Rafa Nadal after that.

The contrast with last year is huge. As he sought to break the 77-year Fred Perry hoodoo, Murray did not face a single player from inside the top 20 before the final. And he knows that an easy first week this year carries a risk of complacency, although he insists he is ready for a stiffer challenge.

'It could become a problem if you are not mentally prepared for the matches to get more challenging,' he said yesterday. 'If you just think everything will be the same as it was in the first week and you are playing well enough, then you are complacent. I'm aware against Kevin things will be a lot tougher. There are going to be harder moments in the second week.

'Last year I was coming to the tournament having not played at the French Open and missed quite a bit of tennis. Because of the grass it was important for me to get a good start in the tournament because maybe physically I wasn't in my best shape. This year I don't see that being a problem.'

Murray has faced Anderson twice. He won their first meeting back in 2010 at the Australian Open then lost at the Montreal Masters the following year. He wasn't a Grand Slam winner at that stage, of course.

Murray has experience of playing  tall players; he has met Croatia's 6ft 11in Ivo Karlovic five times, including on grass, and won all five and played the USA's 6ft 10in John Isner twice and won both. 'Anderson doesn't serve as big as them but he is probably better from the back of the court,' said Murray. 'He has a better return game than Isner and Karlovic. There might be more chances to break but equally he will return better and make more balls when you are serving.

'I'd say Anderson is more mobile than Karlovic. Most of the big guys now who play from the back of the court are pretty good movers.'

Murray is one of the finest returners in the game but he will do some preparatory work with one of his coaching team, Danny Vallverdu, on facing Anderson's serve.

'He's obviously serving different angles at different heights, so the ball's bouncing up much higher. I'll have Danny serve at me  from just behind the service line. That's really the only thing I do differently.'

The ease of Murray's progress means he spent less time on court than his key rivals as he overcame David Goffin, Blaz Rola and then, on Friday evening, Roberto Bautista Agut.

With new coach Amelie Mauresmo  helping him maintain his on-court composure, Murray has looked quietly confident, certainly calm.

'I'm in familiar surroundings. That's going to make you feel more comfortable. Just being at home, staying in your own bed, having all of your friends and family around you - you're going to feel more relaxed away from the court.

'The nerves and the pressure here are also different to other tournaments for me, as well. It's probably greater here than it is at the other Grand Slams. But I enjoy pressure. I like feeling nervous. I'm not scared of that feeling. 

'I felt like I've played my best tennis when I've been under pressure. I obviously love playing here.'
