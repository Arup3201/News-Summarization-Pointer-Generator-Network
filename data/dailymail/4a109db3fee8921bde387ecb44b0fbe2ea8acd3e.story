When Ann and Mark Kennedy decided to give their pink cottage a lick of paint, they didn’t anticipate it would leave council officials seeing red.

The couple have been threatened with court action and told they should have got planning permission before painting the Grade II-listed building.

But they insist the 17th century cottage in Kennford, Devon, is the same colour as when they bought it 12 years ago.

Upset: Ann Kennedy in front of her listed cottage in Devon, which the local council say is too pink

Any different? Ann's daughter Hollie stands in front of the cottage 12 years ago, when the family moved in. They claim it looks no different today

Mrs Kennedy said: ‘Other residents 
around us all had their paintwork done and it made ours look shabby.

'So 
we spent nearly £1,000 renewing ours in the same colour, pink. Before 
the paint had even dried we had someone from the council come round.’

The retired dance teacher added that 
the council had received only one complaint – from a neighbour who did 
not overlook the property. 

The couple say that  Teignbridge District Council in Devon have threatened legal action after a single complaint about the shade of paint used on Lantern Cottage, which they say should be lighter.

Pink is a common colour on houses of this age and type all over the UK.

Particulars: The Kennedys are using the details of their 2001 purchase as evidence to back their claims it looks no different

Mrs Kennedy added: 'I have pictures of the cottage painted in pink when we moved in and on the estate agent's details.

'Just one person has complained. He does not live within viewing distance of the house and has to physically walk around just to see it.

'Then I received a letter from Teignbridge Council saying I had to apply for planning permission.

'I have now put in planning permission for pink. It is certainly not a shocking pink, it is a bit lighter than before. I am devastated and heartbroken by what has happened,' said the retired dance teacher.

The council has the power to make them paint it again if they are still unhappy, which could be another shade of pink.

The Kennedy family say the three bedroom cottage was pink when they bought it for £130,000 12 years ago and took photos of it at the time which prove it is still the same colour.

They have received backing from local Lib Dem councillor Alan Connett, who has intervened on their behalf.

'I think the council is demonstrating the worst of being a Jobsworth,' he said.

'Mrs Kennedy is being put through the bureaucratic mangle because she painted her cottage the same colour.

'Teignbridge Council had just one complaint and the parish council raised no objection at all.

'Council officers could be spending their time chasing really serious planning breaches and protecting listed buildings in real danger.'

Traditional: Ann's Lantern Cottage is a pink traditionally used on homes of a similar age all over the UK

Argument: Ann Kennedy and her husband Mark say their Grade II listed home has not changed at all

Row: There has been one complaint about the colour of the house is Kennford, Devon (pictured), and the council has taken that on towards court

But council bosses say they are following a standard procedure.

A Teignbridge District Council spokeswoman said: 'In November 2011 we received a formal complaint regarding the colour of the Grade II listed cottage in Kennford. Our planning and conservation officers visited and carried out a site inspection.

'We advised the owner that Listed Building Consent (LBC) was required. This is needed before any alterations are made to listed buildings that affect its character or appearance. We also advised that enforcement action could be taken if an application was not received of the alteration was not reversed.

'A retrospective LBC application was lodged on April 23. The application will now go through the usual planning procedures and will be open to comments from everyone, including people living nearby, statutory consultees and anyone else who may wish to put forward a view. A decision is due to be made in June.'
