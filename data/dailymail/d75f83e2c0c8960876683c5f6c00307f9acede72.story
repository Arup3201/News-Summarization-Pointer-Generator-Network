Nathan Eames was left an offensive voicemail message by a Natwest employee after he was turned down for a loan

NatWest has apologised after a business manager accidentally left a three-minute message on a customer's answerphone, mocking his financial situation and calling him a 'k**b'.

Nathan Eames, 39, received a call from a business team manager at the bank to discuss his 'feedback' after he was turned down for a loan.

The call went straight to answerphone and the business manager left a polite message requesting he call her back.

But the business bank manager then failed to hang up properly and, unaware the voicemail was still recording, immediately began joking with colleagues and mocking Mr Eames.

She joked: 'God, I'm glad he wasn't there, 'cause he's a k**b.'

Mr Eames, who declared himself bankrupt in 2009 due to the financial downturn, said he was 'shocked' at the message.

The freelance photographer said: 'I was appalled when I listened to the message. I couldn't believe what I heard.

'Being
 rejected for a loan is one thing - but being subjected to a torrent of 
abuse by ignorant people, completely lacking in empathy and compassion 
for my situation, is quite another.'

Mr Eames, from Poole, Dorset, declared himself bankrupt in January 2009 after falling into financial difficulties during the economic slump.

After getting himself back on his feet, he contacted his local NatWest branch in January to enquire about a £10,000 short-term business loan to enable him to buy a photography studio.

His application was turned down and he was told that he had not been discharged long enough from bankruptcy. 

He didn't let the setback get to him and instead he began putting money aside each month in the hope that he could then fund his dream.

Two weeks ago, NatWest got back in touch with him and asked him to fill out a customer satisfaction survey.

Mr Eames said he told the bank he felt they should consider giving loans to applicants whose bankruptcy had been fully discharged after five years. One week later, on June 22, he was called back by the bank to discuss his feedback.

It is believed the call was made by a worker at the Salisbury branch of the bank in Wiltshire

He didn't take the call but got a message on his voicemail from 'Sarah', a Natwest 'business specialist'.

She said: 'Yeah hi, a message for Nathan, it's Sarah, the Business Specialist at the Natwest in Salisbury.

'It's just a quick courtesy call following your feedback on the 2nd of June with the monthly business banking survey.

'If you could give us a call back and ask to speak to the North Dorset business team, thanks then, bye.'

The caller then thought she had hung up and said to her colleagues: 'God, I'm glad he wasn't there, 'cause he's a knob.

'He's complaining but it's so clear. It says.. No, no, he's put on here 'as ex-bankrupt I do not get anything from you'

Her colleagues are heard laughing in the background as she adds: 'Start considering lending to ex-bankrupts are his comments.'

Natwest has apologised to Mr Eames and says it is investigating the incident and the members of staff involved

After listening to the abuse, furious Mr Eames said: 'Going bankrupt was an extremely difficult decision for me but, at the time, I didn't feel I had any other choice.

'But the bankruptcy was completely discharged and, for the past five years, I have been trying to get back on my feet.

'So to hear someone, who doesn't know me, insulting and mocking me to colleagues was completely unjustified and demoralising.

'Natwest
 should train all their staff to understand the complexities of going 
bankrupt. It was the hardest thing I have ever done.'

'I'm
 now considering closing my business bank account with Natwest. I'm not 
prepared to give them my business when they obviously hold me in such 
low esteem.'

A Natwest spokesperson said: 'We apologise unreservedly to Mr Eames.

'This is not the behaviour we expect from our people and we are currently investigating this incident, dealing directly with the members of staff involved.'
