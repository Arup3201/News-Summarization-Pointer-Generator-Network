New rules: Under planned legislation, doctors will have to check 
that foreign patients are entitled to be in the UK before they are 
allowed NHS treatment

Rigid restrictions on free access to health care for immigrants through the NHS are set to be introduced by the Government.

Before they are allowed to see a GP or be admitted to a hospital ward, foreign patients will have to prove that they are legally entitled to be in the UK.

Students from overseas will also have to pay a 'contribution' to the NHS, according to the Telegraph.

A Government source told the newspaper that the restrictions are to be put in place in a bid to crack down on 'people who have no right to be here'.

Under the rules, time-limited 'NHS numbers' will be issued to those who are not permanently entitled to stay in the UK, with doctors required to ask patients to prove they are in the UK legally before they can register as a patient.

Students from countries outside of Europe will have to pay a Â£200 fee before they can be treated on the NHS.

Hospital bosses will also be told that they must improve steps taken to recover the cost of treatments received by so-called 'health tourists' from abroad.

The measures will be proposed in the Immigration Bill, which is due to be presented to Parliament within days.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told the Telegraph: 'We need to ensure that those residing or visiting the UK are contributing to the system, and that we do as much as possible to target illegal migration.

'We have a National Health Service not an international health service and I am determined to wipe out abuse in the system.'

The legislation spans six Government departments, making it one of the most ambitious pieces of legislation to be drafted by the current Government.

The bill will also see local authorities banned from giving social hosuing to those with no connection to the area, and hefty fines for landlords who do not carry out proper checks on potential tenants and empoyers who take on illegal workers.

Crackdown: The Conservatives hope that the new legislation will redress some of Labour's migration rules and win voters back from UKIP

Foreign criminals will also be allowed to be deported immediately and not afforded a delay by the Human Rights Act - appeals will be heard abroad unless criminals can prove they are in danger of 'serious and irreversible harm' in their own country.

The Conservatives hope that the legislation will not only go some way to redressing Labour's migration policy but also see off the challenge posed by UKIP.

The Government is also expected to tighten rules regarding unemployement benefits in a separate move.
