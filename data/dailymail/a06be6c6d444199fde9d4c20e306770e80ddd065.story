Angus T Jones will return to Two and a Half Men, but the 19-year-old is not expected to sign up for a further season.

Jones, who branded the show 'filth' in a now viral religious video, is thought to want to show up for the rest of his schedule after January but sources say there are murmurs show bosses are not keen to have him back for a new season as a main character.

A source close to the star told People: 'Angus expects to report to work after the holiday break in January.

In the video the young star laughs as he admits his worried family have described the Seventh-day Adventist movement as a 'cult'

'He intends to honor his contract through the end of the season.'

In the meantime Angus is thought to be spending some time with family and friends away from the busy metropolis.

Jones' character Jake joined the army at the end of season 9 and has only appeared in a few episodes of the current season.

'He won't be in every episode,' the source added says of the remaining season 10 episodes.

How he was: Angus, seen here with ex-show star Charlie Sheen, has been on Two and a Half Men since he was a child

'How much they use him will be up to [creator] Chuck Lorre. The intention wasn't ever for him to be in every ep this year anyway. Now it might be less.'

Network CBS has yet to pick up the show for season 11.

But sources told E!: 'Should Two and a Half Men be renewed, it's 'unlikely" that Jones will return as a series regular. You might see him for a few guest spots.'

Those closest to Angus, who is a Seventh Day Adventist, say the teenager doesn't want to risk turning into troubled Charlie Sheen so became involved in the church.

'Part of the reason Angus is so wary of the [TV] industry and so involved with the church is that he's seen what's happened to Charlie [Sheen] front and center.

'He doesn't want to end up like that. Who would?', the family friend told E!

Angus issued a statement apologising, in the most tenuous sense, for making a video branding Two and a Half Men 'filth' then entreating viewers to switch off from the show that made him both rich and famous.

In his statement, Jones, 19, speaks up for his bosses on the CBS show, by saying: 'Chuck Lorre, Peter Roth and many others at Warner Bros. and CBS are responsible for what has been one of the most significant experiences in my life to date.

The document obtained by TMZ continues: 'I thank them for the opportunity they have given and continue to give me and the help and guidance I have and expect to continue to receive from them.'

Without actually taking back anything
he said, the teenager attempted to appease his cast: 'I apologise if my
remarks reflect me showing indifference to and disrespect of my 
colleagues and a lack of appreciation of the extraordinary opportunity 
of which I have been blessed. I never intended that.'

Meanwhile, Christopher Hudson - the Seventh Day Adventist guiding Jones - denied that he was exploiting the actor, as the young star's mother Carey fears.

Hudson, who is believed to be in his 40s, confirmed that he recorded the video in the actor's trailer on the set of Two and A Half Men last week.

Jones - who makes $350,000 per episode playing Jake Harper - was seen
urging fans to 'turn off' the show, saying it would damage their brains.

And speaking exclusively to MailOnline, Hudson - who runs what he describes as a
christian-based ministry called the Forerunner Chronicles -  said Jones believes that Jesus Christ is returning to earth soon - and that he feels a strong urge to prepare others for the Second Coming.

He said he had spoken to Jones since the video was made public, adding: 'I respect his
mother and the love she has for her child and her need to protect him. 
She is concerned about his well being as are many other people.

'But Angus has not had a breakdown and I am not manipulating him. He said let's do an interview - and I turned on the camera.

'Angus is a very educated, thoughtful young man. What was expressed in the video was from the sincere heart of a young man.

'I didn't encourage him to do anything. I turned the cameras on with a young man who had a story to tell.

'He's making a stand with the statements that resonate with his belief system. 

'Angus has a burden in his heart. He realises that the subject 
matter in the programme does not minister to us 
developing the church of God.'

Jones gave a bizarre testimony where he said: 'If you watch Two and a Half Men, 
please stop watching. I'm on Two and a Half Men and I don't want to be 
on it.'

'Please stop watching it and filling your head with filth. People say it’s just entertainment.

'Do some research on the effects of 
television and your brain, and I promise you you’ll have a decision to 
make when it comes to television and especially with what you watch on 
television ... it's bad news.'

The actor has played Jake Harper, the son of Jon Cryer's character, since he was 10-years-old - and has told how he turned to the church to help him following a difficult childhood and his parents divorce.
