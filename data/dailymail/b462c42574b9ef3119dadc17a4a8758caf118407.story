President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama will make their first joint appearance on the daytime show The View next week, taping an episode Monday to air on Tuesday.

Mr Obama's appearance in July 2010 was the program’s most-watched episode ever, as he became the first ever sitting president to visit a daytime talk show. Mrs Obama most recently appeared on the show in August.

But GOP challenger Mitt Romney, who has been doing extensive damage control for his now-infamous leaked dinner party video, may not try to follow suit.

High risk: Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, pictured at a rally on September 19, called four of The View's co-hosts 'sharp-tonged' said it would be a 'high risk' to go on the show

Hail to the hosts: President Obama became the first sitting president to visit a daytime talk show in 2010, and appeared again earlier this year

Mr Romney said in private remarks to donors made public this week by Mother Jones that going on The View is ‘high risk’ because of the ‘four sharp-tongued and not conservative’ female hosts, only one of whom is a conservative.

He singled out Whoopi Goldberg, saying: ‘The last time I was on the show, she said to me, “You know what? I think I could vote for you.” I said I must have done something really wrong.’

After seeing the video footage, co-host Sherri Shepard retorted: ‘If you can’t handle four sharp-tongued women, how are you going to handle the country?’

Mr Romney appeared on the daytime talk show in 2010 to talk about his book, No Apology: The Case For American Greatness.

The View’s conservative, Elisabeth 
Hasselbeck, said Wednesday that she had reached out to Romney, and the 
campaign said he'd love to come on the show in October.

She said she’d love it if he ‘once more join the sharp-tongued chatter.’

Still,
the ladies of The View are looking forward to hosting the first couple.
Co-host Barbara Walters said in a statement: ‘We are honoured to host 
President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama.

Although each of them has appeared several times on the program, this first joint appearance marks a significant milestone.’

Sharp tongues: Co-hosts Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar, Sherri Shepherd, and Barbara Walters were blasted by Romney as being 'sharp-tongued;' Elisabeth Hasselbeck is the show's only conservative

Opposing views: Former View co-host Meredith Vieira, left, slammed Romney while talking to Joy Behar; current co-host Elisabeth Hasselbeck, right, is the show's only current conservative member; she invited the GOP hopeful to appear on the show in October

According to a release, the first couple will discuss the election, their lives inside the White House, as well as their relationship.

Meanwhile, Meredith Vieira spoke out against the Republican party hopeful, saying that in his closed door fundraiser remarks, Mr Romney ‘shows more insight in that moment than he has throughout the entire campaign.’

Speaking to Joy Behar, Vieira added that the co-hosts were indeed ‘tough,’ but also ‘fair-minded.’

Both candidates will appear Sunday in separate interviews on the CBS show 60 Minutes.
