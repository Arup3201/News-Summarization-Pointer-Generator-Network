Alan Smith says he signed for Notts County without knowing how much money he would be paid, revealing: 'I don't even care!'

The former England forward has joined the League One side on a one-year deal as player-coach rather than accept offers in America.

And Smith, who earned Â£60,000 per week over five years at Newcastle United, told the Nottingham Post that manager Shaun Derry convinced him to sign without any discussion about salary.

'I wasn't interested in it because I wanted to come here,' he told the Post. 'As soon as I spoke to Shaun and (assistant) Greg Abbott my decision was made.'

Smith, 33, added: 'I'd spoken about going further afield to America, but it never really appealed to me because there's no promotion or relegation and I don't like playing for fun.

'I just got the right feeling when I came here. The one thing Shaun wants to install in the club is the right mentality. Once he said that to me that was enough.'

Smith won 19 caps for England and won one Premier League title and the Carling Cup while at Manchester United.
