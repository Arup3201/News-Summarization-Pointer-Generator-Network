A mayor in Wisconsin has learned a valuable lesson about his city's weather-predicting critter: Don't get too close.

Jimmy, the official groundhog in Sun Prairie, bit the mayor's left ear during the 67th Groundhog Day celebration on Monday.

A handler was holding the rodent next to 41-year-old Jonathan Freund's face when it promptly launched an attack. Footage of the incident shows Freund flinching back and wincing.

Don't get too close: A mayor in Wisconsin learned a valuable lesson about his city's weather-predicting critter

Nippy around the ears: Jimmy, the official groundhog in Sun Prairie, bit the mayor's ear during the 67th Groundhog Day celebration on Monday

However, he swiftly recovers from the nip and announces to crowds gathered that Jimmy had predicted an early spring with freezing temperatures set to lift.

Despite the aggressive turn of events, spectators delighted in meeting the feisty animal.

Stephen Peterson, a local resident, said: 'It was pretty cool. [Jimmy] looked a little aggressive but he's excited for spring.'

WISC-TV reports that the Groundhog Day celebration got even more precarious when Jimmy's handlers, Jerry and Maria Hahn, said the mayor had got the forecast wrong and there would be six more weeks of winter.

Then the city later issued a statement saying only the mayor can translate Jimmy's prediction.

The Hahns said it Mayor Freund's first time participating in the Groundhog Day celebration, which could have contributed to the confusion. 

A German legend has it that if a furry rodent sees his shadow on February 2, winter will last another six weeks. 

If not, spring comes early. 

Jimmy is the 11th in a long line of groundhogs in the state of Wisconsin. This year marked his first time in front of a crowd. 

He rode to the event with his caretakers in a limousine escorted by Sun Prairie firefighters. 

It marked the Hahn's last year as groundhog handlers. They said they had loved their time as caretakers and hoped the tradition continues for years to come.
