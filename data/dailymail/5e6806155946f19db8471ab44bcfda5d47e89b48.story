An 89-year-old woman who was raped by a 30-year-old nursing home worker was accused of making up the attack and ‘flirting mercilessly’ with her perpetrator by the administrators of the home.

Directors at the Edgewood Vista nursing home in Hermantown, Minnesota have been accused of impeding a rape investigation by suggesting the sex was consensual, court documents show.

Andrew Scott Merzwski was sentenced last month to 53 months in jail for the sexual assault of the elderly woman.

Andrew Scott Merzwski, 30, was sentenced to 53 months in jail for the rape of an 89-year-old resident at the nursing home where he worked

According to court documents, the victim told a nurse she was getting ready for bed when Merzwski came into her room, The Star Tribune reported.

She invited him to sit down and watch a movie with her. Merzwski then walked around the side of her bed and began to take off his clothes.

The 89-year-old gestured towards a photograph of her husband saying ‘It’s not right, this wouldn’t be right’, according to testimony that was filed to the court.

A police report states that the assault then took place. After the attack the woman’s underwear and sheets were bloodstained so she washed them.

The next morning to woman told her daughter about her ordeal, and her daughter reported it to the police. That same say Merzwski admitted having sex with the woman.

But the victim’s ordeal only got worse when she was transferred to a hospital in Duluth where she was held for three days in a psychiatric ward while investigators assessed the truth of her claims.

'The room she was in was dark and cold … and they locked her in at night and all she had was a blanket,' nurse examiner Theresa Flesvig said.

Administrators at the Edgewood Vista nursing home in Hermantown, Minnesota have been accused of impeding a rape investigation by suggesting sex between a 30-year-old employee and an 89-year-old resident was consensual

It was not until later that she was medically examined for evidence of rape and staff found that she had been badly injured.

Ms Flesvig also said that Edgewood’s clinical services director Marilyn Moore asked Ms Flesvig: ‘Did she tell you that this was consensual? Did she tell you that she flirts with this boy mercilessly?’

Ms Flesvig said she was shocked that the blamed was being placed so blatantly on the victim.

The victim’s lawyer Mark Kosieradzki argues the state Health Department ‘failed in its duty as a regulator’ because it did not adequately investigate Edgewood Vista’s handling of the incident.

The Department of Health initiated an investigation into the attack 10 days after the rape on January 28, 2013. Investigators blamed the attack solely on Merzwski and decided not to hold Edgewood Vista to account over the incident because the nursing home had ‘policies to prevent abuse’.

The state carried out two subsequent site inspections and found that Edgewood Vista violated state law by failing to report the incident to police until two days after the rape.

Edgewood Management Group said in a statement that it had cooperated with local and state authorities in the ‘criminal matter involving Andrew Merzwski.’

‘The safety of our residents is of the utmost importance.’
