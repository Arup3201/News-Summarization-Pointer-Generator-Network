Sun Chuanjun cut his sister-in-law, Xu Xiaoli's throat with a kitchen knife after becoming involved in an argument about money at her home in Anmi in Lianing province, north east China.

Neighbours recall how they found the new mother lying dead on the floor after hearing screams coming from the house.

'We went next door and the place looked like a bloodbath,' one said.

Sun Chuanjun 'snatched' the baby from the house and took it to his father's home nearby, police said.

'When he got to his father's house he saw a large pot of boiling water and simply threw the child into it,' a spokesman added.

The house of the man's sister-in-law resembled 'a bloodbath' according to neighbours who found her dead body

Sun Chuanjun confessed to the atrocities after being arrested, adding the incident was caused by a dispute over money. 

The baby is fighting for its life in a
local hospital with third degree burns covering most of its tiny body, while the man's 
father suffered severe burns after plunging his hands into the pot to 
rescue the child. 

Police have said the man should expect no mercy for his crimes which have shocked the country.

A spokesman said: 'We are not used to such callous crimes against innocents in China.

'Family is everything. The killer was caught only moments later and has 
confessed everything.

'He can expect little mercy when it comes to trial.' 

It is thought he will be sentenced to death by firing squad and have his organs harvested for transplants.

Neighbours expressed their shock at the incident which has disturbed the nation according to police investigating the crime
