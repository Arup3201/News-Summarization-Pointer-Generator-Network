Artisan baker Paul Hollywood has shown his half-baked business sense after it was revealed his bread company has racked up debts

Great British Bake Off star Paul Hollywood's dough has been failing to rise, figures have revealed.

The artisan baker and TV chef's bread company is in liquidation and has racked up debts of just under £60,000, according to the latest accounts.

The figures filed at Companies House were for The Paul Hollywood Artisan Bread LLP, which he set up in Kent in June 2007.

The Daily Telegraph reported today that £28,616 is owed to Hollywood himself.

Hollywood, 47, announced he would be closing his speciality bread business last year after his television commitments left him unable to continue.

'It's a huge headache and massive problem because I wasn't there enough,' he said previously.

Hollywood set up the firm after being inspired by the baking techniques he discovered on his travels to Cyprus, Egypt and Jordan.

In 2008, Harrods started stocking the firm's Roquefort and almond sourdough which, at £15 per loaf, was the most expensive in the country at the time.

The company has struggled in the past going £11,793 into the red for the year to June 30, 2012.

It is not the first time Mr Hollywood has had to close down a company.

In 2003, he liquidated his company Hollywood Bread. Liquidators were appointed in April 2003 and the company had debts of £262,000 when it was dissolved in December 2005.

One of the companies his firm owed money to was Bradleys bakers, of Ashford in Kent, which had to write off £2,400.

Managing director Graham Linkins said last July: 'In all the coverage I've seen about Paul Hollywood, I've never read that ten years ago he had a business that went bust.

'About three years ago, I walked into my front room and saw him on the TV and said, "That b*****d owes me money".'

Liverpool-born Hollywood's other firm, Paul Hollywood Limited, however is rising steadily.

The latest accounts for the company show that it had a healthy £409,730 sitting on its books.

MailOnline has made efforts to contact Mr Hollywood's agent.
