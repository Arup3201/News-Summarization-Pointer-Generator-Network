Sprinter Johnny Peacock and long jumper Greg Rutherford might already have Olympic gold medals to their name but if these photos are anything to go by, they probably deserve another.

The pair stripped down to their underwear for a festive photoshoot and in a candid interview, revealed all about love and life post Olympics.

While Rutherford recently split from his girlfriend of eight years - fashion PR, Liz Rose - Peacock admitted that he's happily paired off with fellow Paralympic sprinter, Sally Brown.

Ginger Greg also confessed to feeling slightly overwhelmed by all the attention from the ladies, saying: 'I don’t know about being sexy!

'People say I’m bringing ginger back but it’s never been cool, so I don’t know where I’ve brought it back from!

He also used the interview with Now magazine to talk about his recent break up. 'I’ve been single for two months,' he revealed.

'I’m so busy, it’s hard to think about it. But once I’m back being an athlete I’ll realise the impact of being single.

'I’m happy about it. It was my decision and you have to embrace change and move on. Part of the problem was I’m so busy, I don’t have time for a relationship now.

'With the stress of travelling and competing, we started to grow apart. It’s a shame as she’s always been so supportive of me, and sacrificed everything for me, but we drifted towards being friends more than anything else.

'I feel like it’s the right thing for both of us. It’s sad and a big change after eight years but it’s for the best.

Which one's for Sally? Peacock finally admitted to having a girlfriend - fellow Paralympian, Sally Brown

Peacock, meanwhile, was happy to talk about his blossoming relationship with fellow sprinter Sally Brown and revealed that his friends are a little bit jealous of all the female attention he gets.

'I think some of [my friends] are jealous more 
than anything. My best mate Martin finds it funny that I’ve got myself a
girlfriend just as all these women are starting to give me some 
attention.'

He added: '[Sally is] stunning, down to earth and caring. I’m so lucky! But we 
don’t get to see each other a lot.

He also revealed that he's a romantic at heart, once even driving from his Cambridgshire home to Northern Ireland - a 12 hour trip - just for a two day visit.

'In 
total, it was around 1,300 miles there and back and driving around – but
it was worth it.'

Both men will be spending Christmas with their families, Rutherford on holiday in the French Alps and Peacock at home in East Anglia.

Newly single Rutherford also revealed that he'll be spending some time pursuing his favourite hobby: baking.

Asked what present he'd give to a girl, he revealed: 'I wouldn’t buy [her] anything. I’d bake a cake.
I was so busy I missed the Great British Bake Off this year and was 
gutted.

'My friends think I’m weird. I cook as well and I like 
experimenting. For a long time I wanted my own restaurant.'

The red headed athlete also admitted that when his schedule clears up, he'll be looking for love again and revealed he's after someone to make him laugh and who'll be willing to watch history documentaries with him.

'I’m a bit of a geek at heart,' he confessed. 'I love history and I watch Time Team. I wanted to be an archaeologist for a while. Harrison Ford made it cool as Indiana Jones.'
