Authorities are looking for a motive for the fatal shootings of a couple found dead in their northwestern New Jersey home this week.

Vernon police say the bodies of 41-year-old Cindy Fortino and her 45-year-old husband, Dean, were found late Thursday morning in their bed.

The family are said to be in shock. The couple had two young children who are now staying with their grandmother.

 Luz Soto said the deaths of her daughter and son-in-law were 'a private loss.'

'We're just in awe,' Soto said. 'We don't know what happened. It's a loss, no matter what happened, it's our loss.'

Pam Valentin, Cindy Fortino's cousin, said she was 'still in shock over the loss of my cousin and best friend.'

Valentin said the couple were 'diehard Rangers fans' who loved taking their children to see monster trucks.

'They were always taking pictures and doing things with the kids as a family,' she said. 'That's why this tragedy is so puzzling,' she told NJ.com.

The couple had just moved into a new home five months ago. 

Police went there after being asked to check on the couple's welfare.

Suicide: Mrs Fortino shot herself however Mr Fortino's death remains under investigation

Authorities say Cindy Fortino's death has been ruled a suicide, but the manner of Dean Fortino's death remains undetermined pending further examination. 

It's also not clear when the shootings occurred.

Sussex County prosecutors say there's no cause for public alarm because there is no evidence a third party was involved in the shooting. 

First Assistant Prosecutor Gregory Mueller said that the precise time of their deaths was currently unknown.

Township police were assisted by the New Jersey State Police crime scene unit along with the Sussex County Prosecutor's Office.

Taking care: The couples two young children are now living with their grandparents
