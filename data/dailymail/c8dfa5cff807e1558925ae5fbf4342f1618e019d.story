An experienced skier has died after being buried by an avalanche.

Daniel Maddox, a father of one who was very well known in skiing circles, was killed after a vast wall of snow fell from 1,000ft above him.

The force of the impact swept the 41-year-old into a gully in Glen Coe in Argyll on Saturday, burying him under 13ft of snow and rock.

Tragedy: Daniel Maddox, a 41-year-old father of one, was killed after a vast wall of snow 
fell from 1,000ft above him on Saturday afternoon. He is the 14th person to die on Scotland's mountains this year

Rescue teams fought for hours to free Mr Maddox of Tillicoultry, Clackmannanshire, who had gone off- piste, away from the official ski area, when he got into trouble.

His body was pulled from the snow yesterday morning, making him the 14th person to die on Scotland’s mountains this year.

Mr Maddox’s parents, Barbara and John, were too upset to speak last night. His 14-year-old son Luke was also coming to terms with the tragedy.

Colin McPhail, owner of Footworks sports shop in Edinburgh, where Mr Maddox worked as a ski technician, paid tribute to the extreme sports addict.

‘Danny loved skiing more than anything and he was hugely respected within the skiing and snowboarding community,’ he said.

‘No one would have been better prepared to deal with an avalanche,  he was incredibly experienced.

‘It is very sad and he will always be remembered for his gentleness and approach to life. God rest his soul.’

Mr Maddox was a close friend of Finlay Mickel, a Scottish winter sports star and one of Britain’s fastest downhill skiers. Mr Mickel raced for Scotland in the 1980s and, after retiring, worked for Glencoe Ski Club and as a ski technician and teacher.

He was also skiing at the Glencoe centre on Saturday, when the risk of an avalanche was officially given as  ‘considerable’.

But Mr Maddox went off piste, leaving the safer designated ski slopes, which are regularly maintained and patrolled, to go it alone. It is believed his weight triggered an avalanche 650ft wide.

A male friend skiing on a different slope above Mr Maddox escaped unscathed.

A team of rescuers was scrambled to the area, close to the Glencoe Ski Centre, at 1pm on Saturday, where they began a desperate search.

John Grieve, leader of the Glencoe Mountain Rescue Team, said: ‘The avalanche came down into a gully well over 60ft in depth, so the snow was very deep and compressed.

‘It had turned to ice and had a lot of boulders in it to dig through, which is why the rescue went on for so long.

Glencoe Mountain Rescue said the avalanche travelled about 1,000ft down a rocky face of a slope

Harsh conditions: The search focused on an area 'off the piste' near to the Glencoe Ski Centre

‘We found Daniel’s gear, his hat and gloves, so we had a good assumption of where his body would be but had to abandon the search overnight on Saturday. The next day we located his boots and dug him out.’

By the time the search resumed at 8am yesterday, it was known Mr Maddox would not have survived.

It was a recovery operation for the 50-strong team from Glencoe and Lochaber mountain rescue teams, Northern Constabulary and a rescue helicopter.

Mr Grieve added: ‘It was a pity it was such a sad outcome but that is the way it is with avalanches – not many people survive them. I knew Daniel when he was young and he was a vastly experienced skier. He knew the risks of skiing off-piste.’

Off-piste skiing, also referred to as 
'back country' skiing, involves the use of unofficial slopes which are 
not patrolled or maintained.

Mark
Fulton, 25, from Gourock, Inverclyde, was skiing all day with his 
family on the slopes at the Glencoe Ski Centre and saw the rescue 
mission unfold.

'I was 
up there from about 10am and at lunchtime we went in to get something to
eat at the cafe and we saw an emergency helicopter hovering about,' he 
said.

'It looked as 
though it was coming in to land near the bottom of the hill. When we 
were leaving later I saw police and mountain rescue vans all gathered as
well.

Members of Glencoe Ski Club said they were devastated by the news. One, who did not want to be named, said: ‘Danny was the one who taught me to ski, he was a great teacher. We all went out onto the mountain today because it’s what he would have wanted.

‘He wouldn’t have wanted anyone sitting in their armchair at home, even after what happened to him. Skiing was what he really loved.’

Earlier this year four climbers were 
killed in an avalanche on Bidean Nam Bian, a mountain which is about 10 
miles from Glencoe Ski Centre.

Hospital
doctor Rachel Majumdar, 29; PhD student Tom Chesters, 28; Christopher 
Bell, 24, also a PhD student; and 25-year-old junior doctor Una Finnegan
are thought to have fallen 1,000ft in the incident on January 19.

Yesterday, two men were airlifted off
Ben Nevis after becoming stranded half way up by icy conditions. They 
were wearing ‘inappropriate footwear’, rescuers said.

Lochaber Mountain Rescue team has issued warnings to those using the so-called ‘tourist track’ on Ben Nevis to take care.
