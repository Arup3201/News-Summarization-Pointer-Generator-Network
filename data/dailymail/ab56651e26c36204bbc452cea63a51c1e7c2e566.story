Slumped under a heap of blankets in a room in total disarray, she appeared to most observers to be a corpse.

But the lifeless character was not a dead person. She is, in fact, a recluse Korean woman who lives her entire life in front of three webcams 24 hours a day. Or, at least, that is what people believe.

Very little is known about the mysterious woman, whose day-to-day activities are followed by thousands of people around the world via the internet, on a channel dubbed 'Chip-chan'.

But despite the lack of information, viewers have become hooked on webcams capturing every moment of her bizarre life.

From hundreds of hours of footage, observers have managed to piece together weird aspects of her life.

She only rarely leaves her house - thought to be in Seoul - and when she doe, she is dressed in a disguise. She also appears to spend up to 20 hours a day asleep, sometimes in a filing cabinet.

Internet users have manage to track down a blog, according to Kernel Magazine, which apparently originating from the same place as the webcams.

The blog casts more light on the inner workings of the woman's mind.

In
it she claims a microchip has been implanted in her ankle which is used
by a corrupt policeman called 'P' to control her actions. 

She claims this malign character 'P' is stalking her and turns the cameras off he enters he apartment.

rambling messages she scrawls in a strange script on boards for viewers
to read.

After a painstaking search, someone was able to decipher the words, which read: 'Don’t get tricked, don’t get fooled. Early every morning. If someone comes that paralyzes the person. I can’t be stopped.'

Another sign read: 'The stalker use this skill from 2006, I have slept for 20 hours everyday since then. I do not know what have happened while I sleep, I have been always afraid of sleeping.'

Now swathes of the internet have been given over to people's theories about who the woman is and what she is up to.

Other internet speculators claim to have spoken to police officers in Seoul who are aware of Chip-chan, according to Kernel Magazine.

It is understood local police are aware of her and claim she is mentally ill.
