Tossing pancakes on Sunday mornings helps David Cameron forget about the pressure of running the country.

The Prime Minister said it is hard to ‘think too much about politics if you’re in danger of burning the pancakes’.

He also revealed how he relies on a large entourage to do his job, is only allowed to listen to Bruce Springsteen if wife Samantha is away and suggested Wayne Rooney’s jitters at Manchester United developed after sitting next his mother, Mary, at a lunch.

Mr Cameron has been plagued by allegations of ‘chillaxing’ when he should be running the country, from playing tennis at Chequers to becoming addicted to games on his iPad.

Today he lifted the lid on another ritual in the Cameron household, this time rushing to escape burning political debate in the heat of the kitchen.

Take part in a radio station Q&A session, he said his ‘perfect weekend’ is spent with his family in his West Oxfordshire constieuncy of Witney.

He told Capital FM: ‘I love Sunday morning’s cooking pancakes with the children, it’s pretty messy but I love doing things like that. 

‘I’ve got a nine-year-old, seven-year-old and a soon to be three-year-old, and doing things with them at the weekend is actually a great way of switching off. 

‘It’s difficult to think too much about politics if you’re in danger of burning the pancakes.’

The admission immediately drew comparisons with Alfred the Great, who legend has it burnt cakes he was supposed to be watching in the home of a peasant woman in Somerset.

Boss ban: The Prime Minister revealed he could only listen to Bruce Springsteen when wife Samantha was away because she ‘doesn’t like The Boss'

The great mystery surrounding who advised Wayne Rooney to consider leaving Manchester United may have been solved - David Cameron's mum.

The Prime Minister revealed how his mother sat next to the England striker at a lunch before Andy Murray's Wimbledon triumph last month.

Mr Cameron was next to US golf champion Justin Rose, and was unable to hear what Rooney was discussing with Mrs Cameron.

'My mum sat next to Wayne Rooney and I was trying to listen in to that, because my mum she was a Magistrate for 40 years in Newbury, she’s not a big football fan. 

'But, they seemed to be getting on fine, but I don’t know what advice she gave, maybe this is what set all this off.'

Rooney trained with the reserves at Manchester United this morning.

The England striker is determined to leave the Barclays Premier League for Premier League rivals Chelsea.

In another insight into his private life,  Mr Cameron revealed his musical ‘guilt pleasure’ was listening to Bruce Springsteen.

Mrs Cameron ‘doesn’t like The Boss’ so he can only listen to him when she is away.

In 1985 he queued for hours to see Springsteen in France in ‘one of those concerts that went on for four hours.

‘That was my guilty pleasure. I queued for hours and I was right at the front and I just thought he was fantastic. 

‘So, when Samantha is not around there is a little bit of Dancing in the Dark or something like that, or, Born in the USA, so that is my guilty…but actually I like his stuff like Nebraska and all the rather grim dark stuffy, so that is my guilty pleasure I suppose.’

The PM was challenged over the cost of
 childcare, and how he has it easy compared to most working parents 
juggling his job with family life.

He admitted: ‘You’re completely right,
 of course I have a busy life but I’ve got hundreds of people working 
for me, arranging everything, you know, so I can concentrate on the job 
in hand. 

‘And, I know as a dad how difficult it
 is in the holiday times trying to keep your children entertained and 
also work at the same time, it’s incredibly difficult.’

Like all politicians desperate to 
appeal for the youth vote, Mr Cameron was also at pains to burnish his 
musical credentials, boasting of listening to Mumford and Sons, First 
Aid Kit and Kurt Vile.

Speaking on XFM he said he listens to most music on Spotify, but quickly insisted he pays the subscription service.

‘They’re having to work very hard all 
these pop stars these days, because of Spotify and everything else there
 are many more live appearances, many more festivals, it’s back to the 
days of the wandering minstrel they’re having to really earn their 
keep.’

Mr Cameron later claimed he was ‘too busy getting on with the job to think’ about his legacy as Prime Minister.

‘What I want to do is get the country going in the right direction, get the deficit paid down, get the economy moving, get unemployment falling, get jobs for people.

‘But, I think as important as those sort of economic things is a sense of values, I think the most important thing is for people to feel that in Britain if you work hard and do the right thing you can succeed, you can get on, you can make something of your life.’
