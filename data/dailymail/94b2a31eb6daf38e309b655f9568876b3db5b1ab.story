In 14 short months, Texas teacher Roni Tarver went from size 22 to size 6 after shedding 100lbs - and all thanks to the power of dance with a dash of self-discipline.

Tarver, 29, teaches agriculture science and lives in Hurst, Texas, with her husband of two years, Tom.

Just over a year ago, the 5-foot-6 woman weighed 235lbs and was suffering from chronic lower back pain, which she medicated with 15 ibuprofen tablets a day.  

'I cried every time I went shopping for clothes because I kept having to buy bigger sizes,' she wrote online.

Speaking to CNN this week, Mrs Tarver said what made the situation even worse is that her husband never remarked on her drastic weight gain, which left her feeling guilty about letting herself go.

One night in November 2012, Tarver was crying herself to sleep when she made the decision to turn her life around and lose weight.

The next day, the high school teacher got down to work tracking her caloric intake, walking and riding a stationary bike.

A couple of months later, Tarver mustered enough courage to go to a local gym, where she discovered Zumba - an increasingly popular form of exercise that incorporates dance and aerobics.

Not before long, the gym's fitness room that hosted dance classes became her second home where Tarver spent most evenings cutting a rug to the sounds of Latin beats.

‘You really feel like you're in a club, dancing with people, but you don't have a hangover in the morning,’ she described the fitness regimen to the cable news network.

A daughter of an aerobics dance instructor, Tarver took to Zumba like a fish to water. After 10 exhausting but productive months, her instructors at the gym suggested that Tarver should get certified and teach classes herself.

Roni Tarver followed through, and for the past four months she has been teaching Zumba at the Fitness 200 gym in North Richland Hills. 

In an effort to get healthy, the 29-year-old also quit smoking and radically changed her eating habits, shunning fast food and all dairy - which was the hardest part of the process since she loved cheese.

With the help of a calorie counter app she downloaded on her smartphone, Tarver monitored her food consumption, making sure her daily intake does not exceed 1,700 calories.

Most days, her menu featured fruits and vegetables, a breakfast protein shake and a low-calorie frozen dinner.

Her weekly cheat meal of choice was two bacon and egg taquitos from a national fast food chain.

When Roni Tarver set out on her quest for a slimmer body, she tipped the scales at 235lbs and wore size 22 pants. Just over a year later, the agriculture teacher slimmed down to 135lbs and was buying size 6 clothes.

For her husband, Tom Tarver, a dispatcher at a valet service, Roni has always been beautiful, but he says her weight loss has made his wife healthier and happier. 

On her Facebook page Tuesday, Roni Tarver wrote that some people commenting on her story on CNN's website have been extremely cruel, but she was pleasantly surprised to discover that women she has never met were quick to come to her defense.

'It's a great day to be a woman,' she gushed.
