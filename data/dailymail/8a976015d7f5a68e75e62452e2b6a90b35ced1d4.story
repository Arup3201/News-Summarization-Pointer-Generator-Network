This is the moment BBC comedian Simon Brodkin somehow managed to get on the Goodison Park pitch and warm up with the Manchester City squad.

Players, including goalkeeper Joe Hart and Kolo Toure and assistant manager David Platt looked on in bemusement as Brodkin, whose is best known for his comic creation Lee Nelson, jogged along the touchline and did stretches.

In this instance, Brodkin was in the guise of footballer Jason Bent, a character from his BBC Three series Lee Nelson's Well Funny People, wearing an identical maroon tracksuit to the City players.

His presence alerted players, stewards and security staff and he was escorted off the pitch and later arrested.

A spokesman for Merseyside Police said: 'We can confirm that a 35-year-old from London was arrested before the Everton v Manchester City game this afternoon.

'A man was arrested on suspicion of pitch encroachment after he went on to the pitch.

'He has been taken to a police station where he will be interviewed.'

Play was held up in the corresponding fixture between the two sides last season when a man ran onto the field and handcuffed himself to a goalpost.

The man had been protesting about Ryanair's recruitment policy after his daughter was denied a job by the airline.

Everton won today's game 2-0.

He
emerged from the crowd with just under five minutes remaining until 
half-time and shackled himself to the frame of City keeper Joe Hart's 
goal.

After a hold-up which resulted in five minutes of first-half stoppage time, he was released and led away by police.
