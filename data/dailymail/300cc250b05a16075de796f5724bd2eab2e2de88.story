Liverpool midfielder Suso and Real Madrid contract rebel Sami Khedira could be targets for AC MIlan, says the Italian giants' chief executive Adriano Galliani.

Suso arrived from Cadiz in 2010 but has only made 21 appearances for Liverpool, his last a Capital One Cup outing in September.

The 20-year-old, who faces a couple of months on the sidelines with a groin injury, has been persistently linked with a move to the San Siro with his contract at Anfield up in the summer.

'Transfer market? I know where can improve, but I don't tell that to you. Suso? He has an expiring contract and he'll tell us if he wants to move or stay,' Galliani told Gianluca Di Marzio.

Meanwhile, Milan are also keen on a potential move for Khedira, who will be free to leave the Bernabeu at the end of the season.

Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United have also been heavily linked with a move for the Germany midfielder, who  has reportedly turned down two deals from Real.

'Khedira? He'd be a good acquisition but he earns a lot, he's an important player and it's not sure whether he'll renew with Real Madrid or not, he asks for very high wages,' Galliani added.Â
