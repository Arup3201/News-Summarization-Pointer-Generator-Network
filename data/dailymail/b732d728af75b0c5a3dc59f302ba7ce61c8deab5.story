Atletico Madrid closed the gap on La Liga leaders Barcelona to two points as they cruised to victory over Sevilla.

The La Liga champions sealed a routine win over the visitors with first-half goals from Koke and Saul Niguez, as well as a penalty from Raul Garcia and a goal in the closing stages from Raul Jimenez, securing Madrid's fourth win in six games.

The impact of Diego Simeone on the sidelines for the hosts couldn't go unnoticed either, as the Atletico boss marauded the troops and fans alike, after returning to the dugout for the first time after completing his eight-game ban.

After a stop-start beginning to the game the hosts started to dominate proceedings and deservedly took the lead just before the 20 minute mark as Koke's long-range effort was deflected into the net by Martín Pareja. 

Atletico continued to put the pressure on Sevilla - who in contrast were showing no real attacking threat - and then doubled their lead just before the interval.

Widely renowned for their efficiency from set-piece Madrid showed exactly just why as they doubled their advantage as they capped off an excellent team move.

Miranda got hold off the ball on the edge of the area after a knock-down with his volley across goal finding Niguez at the back, whose cushioned header found the far corner to put the hosts in complete control.

The hosts continued their dominance in the second half with substitute Antoine Griezmann clipping a cross from the right-hand side from Garcia over the bar, before the latter made it three for Atletico as he sent Beto the wrong way from the penalty spot.

Simeone's side weren't finished though as Raul Jimenez's impressive header from close range sealed an emphatic victory for the hosts as they leapt to second in the table.
