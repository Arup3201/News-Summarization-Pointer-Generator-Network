Millions of pounds is being wasted on government reviews and consultations, MPs said yesterday.

The
Coalition has opened 984 inquiries – more than one for each day it has 
been in power – into issues as diverse as ice-cream van chimes and the 
electronic monitoring of pigs.

Other
reviews include whether street sweepers should require qualifications 
and whether mothers should be able to use vouchers to buy frozen 
vegetables.

MPs have said millions of pounds is being wasted after an investigation found the Coalition opened 984 inquiries since coming into power

Richard
Bacon, a Tory member of the Commons public accounts committee, 
yesterday called on the National Audit Office to investigate, perhaps 
not seeing the irony of his request.

‘The
huge scale of these reviews raises questions, and I wouldn’t discourage
the NAO from looking at this area,’ he said. ‘On this scale they must 
have serious financial implications, with hundreds of civil servants 
being diverted to work on them.

‘These
reviews could lead to delay and sclerosis inside departments, because 
civil servants will be hanging around waiting, rather than taking 
action.

‘I would be very interested in knowing from the NAO how much this all costs and how effective and economic it is.’

Critics
say the figures show David Cameron has broken a pledge to slash the 
number of pointless reviews. Late last year the Prime Minister vowed to 
‘cut through the dither’, adding: ‘If there is no need for a 
consultation, don’t have one.’

Yet
a year after saying in 2011: ‘It is hard to believe we need government 
regulations on issues such as ice-cream van jingles’, his government set
up a consultation on the very same issue.

The Coalition has opened more than one inquiry for each day it has been in power, while George Osborne's Treasury alone has set up 84 reviews

An inquiry was opened into how long ice-cream van chimes should ring for and where they should be able to ring, but there has been no response from the Government in six months

An investigation by The Times found that many of the 984 reviews have not yet been acted upon.

The
survey of the 15 largest Whitehall departments showed that almost a 
third of the consultations set up since 2010 had still not received an 
official response.

Bernard
Jenkin, Tory chairman of the public administration committee, called on
parliamentary select committees to ask individual departments for 
explanations.

‘It is 
staggering that the Government should spend so much time and money and 
produce so few outcomes,’ he said. ‘This gives the term “kicked into the
long grass” a new reality.

The government has also looked into whether pig farmers should inform councils about the movements of their animals by letter or e-mail

‘The Prime Minister complains rightly
about dithering and inaction but Whitehall seems to be institutionally 
predisposed to dithering and inaction by review and consultation. This 
could be costing tens of millions of pounds.’

The
17,000-word review into ice cream van chimes, sent to 23 organisations,
asked the public how long chimes should ring for, where they should 
ring and until what time.

One question asked whether chimes should be played after 8pm because children’s bedtimes are getting later.

Twelve
months on, ministers have still not come to a decision on the 
less-than-pressing issue. A consultation by the Department for Transport
was prompted by a one-man campaign to save a railway committee that 
decides which artefacts should be saved for the nation.

Labour
peer Lord Faulkner of Worcester made a plea in the House of Lords that 
the eight-man Railway Heritage Committee, which costs £100,000 a year, 
be saved from the bonfire of the quangos.

A consultation was launched and all 32 respondents supported the plan to move the committee’s role to the Science Museum.

Another consultation into Cornish wine received no responses at all.

Andrew
Haldenby, director of the Reform think-tank, said: ‘David Cameron 
promised a post-bureaucratic age but his record in government is very 
different.’

George 
Osborne’s Treasury has set up 84 reviews, Vince Cable’s Department for 
Business 61, the Department for Work and Pensions has set up 73 and the 
Department of Health 80.
