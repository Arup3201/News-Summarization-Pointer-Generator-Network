Steven Finn is not keen to dwell on the past. But less than a year after being branded ‘unselectable’ during England’s disastrous Ashes tour, he can at least put his technical meltdown in perspective. What didn’t kill him has definitely made him stronger.

With Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad both sitting out England’s one-day tour of Sri Lanka because of injury, Finn has been thrust into the role of attack leader. 

And, during Friday’s warm-up game in Colombo, he responded with a wicket in his second over. It bore the hallmarks of the old Finn: bounce and movement off a good length, a nick to the keeper.

It was no more than a start, and there was rust: Finn also sent down four wides. But, aged just 25, it is as if he has already gone through his midlife crisis. There is, once more, a spring in his step.

‘Everyone goes through tricky times in their career,’ he said. ‘You learn a lot about yourself. Before I experienced what happened in the last 12 months I didn’t really have an understanding: I just ran up and bowled.

‘Now I have a far better understanding, so if it is going wrong or I’m halfway through a game and it doesn’t quite feel right, I can pinpoint what’s going on.’

His travails can be traced back to the summer of 2012, when South Africa captain Graeme Smith opportunistically drew the umpires’ attention to Finn’s habit of knocking over the stumps with his right knee during his delivery stride. As a result, he changed his run-up – and everything unravelled.

In Australia, Ashley Giles – then the one-day coach – came out with the ‘unselectable’ line. Like a broken record, it stuck.

‘I think it was fair enough,’ said Finn. ‘Unselectable is a harsh and frank way to put it. But if I’m being honest I couldn’t have gone out there and done myself justice in an England shirt.

‘But it spurred me on and motivated me to become selectable again. That was my dream when I left Australia.’

Some hard work with Middlesex bowling coach Richard Johnson and a summer on the county circuit, where he claimed a respectable 48 championship wickets at 30 apiece, earned him a recall to England’s one-day side against India. It felt like the start of a career – yet this was a bowler with 90 Test wickets to his name.

Finn is impatient to turn that youthful promise into something more tangible: ‘I don’t want to feel my way back in – I want to hit the ground running when I get into an international game.

‘There’s room for improvement with my pace to get back to where I was 18 months, two years ago. But I’m in a far better place now than I was 12 months ago, and that’s going to stand me in good stead for the rest of my career.’

The good news is that, unlike some fast bowlers, Finn regards Asian pitches as an opportunity, not an obstacle.

Ten one-day internationals in India have brought him 15 wickets and the respect of the local batsmen, and in the UAE against Pakistan at the start of 2012, he picked up 13 wickets at an average of 10.

‘I really enjoy bowling in subcontinental conditions,’ he said. ‘I can control a reverse-swinging ball quite well, which plays a big part out here. And these wickets will be more seamer-friendly than in India.’

These are early days in the second phase of his England career. Yet the signs are promising. Whisper it, but Steven Finn may be on the verge of becoming very selectable indeed.
