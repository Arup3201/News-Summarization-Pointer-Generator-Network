Shocking: Human rights campaigners are outraged at this video of an Asian man wearing an orange overall being severely beaten by a Saudi man dressed in white robes, allegedly for looking at his wife

Injury: The Saudi man is seen repeatedly whip the Asian man with his belt. The victim falls to the floor crying out in pain, where he is kicked and whipped over and over

According to the English service of Al Arabiya, a news site, the Saudi man is allegedly accusing the other man of talking to his wife.

The Saudi man then starts to repeatedly whip the Asian man with his belt. The victim falls to the floor crying out in pain, where he is kicked and whipped over and over.

When he gets to his feet, the Saudi man appears to grab him by the throat and forces him up against the wall before continuing to beat him.

The whole attack, which takes place in a room with a table, chairs and a playing TV, is filmed by a third party and has been shared online.

The shocking footage has prompted Saudi Arabia' Human Rights Commission to condemn the attack after it received numerous complaints.

Spokesperson Ibrahim al-Shadi told Al Arabiya the beating was a 'flagrant violation of the victimâ€™s rights to safety and dignity.

The act also flouted rules set by Islamic Sharia, he said.

The National Society for Human Rights is 'investigating the issue,' its head Mefleh al-Qahtani told AFP, quoted in the Times of India.

The semi-governmental organisation would demand the perpetrator be punished if the case is confirmed.

'We do not have enough details about the identity of the man, or on where the incident took place,' he said.
