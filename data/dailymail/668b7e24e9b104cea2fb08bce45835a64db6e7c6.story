A California woman on a quest to find the biological parents who gave her up for adoption in 1978 has turned to Facebook for help.

Tana Inskeep posted a plea to coincide with her 36th birthday on April 21 asking social media users to like, share and spread the word in the hope she'll find the birth family she's wondered about her entire life.

'I don't want to wait any longer,' Tana told KHOU. 'I'm ready to take a step [and] be courageous and I don't want to waste this life.'

Does this sound familiar? Tana Inskeep was adopted in 1978 and is now searching for her birth family with the help of Facebook

The happily married mother first turned to the agency that found her an adopted family that late 70s spring.

They couldn't given exact details, but Tana did learn of her siblings, include a possible twin brother who was born with her via cesarean section.

She also learned that her mother had an Hispanic background and her father was a white man.

With that info, Tana created a poster detailing all she knows and put it on a Facebook group called Find Tana's Birth Family.

'Pretty much my whole life I've always known I was adopted,' said Tana, who knows her mother was Hispanic and her father white. 'I've always kind of felt like the odd man out'

'I didn't look like anybody and I've just always been curious,' said Tana

She hopes the poster and the other things she's posted, including documents detailing her siblings and other family members, will soon lead her to some answers.

And she's not afraid, even if the truth isn't pretty.

'I'm not worried at all,' she said. 'I'm at a really good place and my faith has played a big part in it.'

She says the driving force behind her quest is curiosity and she believes that anyone in her shoes would do the same.

'I think everybody wants to be known and to know where they came from and who they are,' she said.

Details: Tana learned a great deal about her biological family from her Texas adoption agency but nothing specific enough to track them down

'Pretty much my whole life I've always known I was adopted,' said the mother of two, whose adoption papers indicate specifics like blood type and diseases in the family

Hoping for some answers: Tana knows she has siblings and even a twin brother
