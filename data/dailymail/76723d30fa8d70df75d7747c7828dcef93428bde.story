To the relief of Mauricio Pochettino, he has discovered some players who are comfortable with the pitch dimensions at White Hart Lane.

As excuses for points failure in the Barclays Premier League go, his moan about the playing surface is right up there with the best of them. Like his team, he can do better than that.

Fortunately for Tottenham's coach, the conditions at White Hart Lane suit Erik Lamela and Harry Kane. These two could play on anything.

Lamela came on as substitute at half-time, replacing captain Aaron Lennon and steering his team into the Capital One Cup quarter-finals with a beaut off his right boot.

*Match ratings by Neil Ashton at White Hart Lane 

Boy did they need him to win this clash against a robust and resilient Brighton team.

Lamela, he of Rabona fame, is a class act, even if he did incur the wrath of his manager after emerging from a toilet cubicle just before the start of the second half.

'I was angry because we knew Lennon couldn't continue so I wanted Lamela on. After that he went to the toilet and he came out late.'

He was standing upright when he danced into the penalty area, putting Spurs ahead against their tricky, Championship opponents.

Kane added another, following up his hat-trick here in last week's Europa League clash against Asteras Tripolis.

'Harry, Harry give us a wave,' demanded the Tottenham fans in the Park Lane stand when he was substituted towards the end of this nervy affair. He responded, reluctantly. He seems like a nice chap.

Lamela, who put Spurs in front eight minutes after the break, has scored three times this season. All of them a have been on home soil.

He used his magic boots to finish off the sweetest of moves, a one-two with Roberto Soldado, to inch Tottenham ahead against Sami Hyypia's side.

Next they will face Newcastle, the team who beat them 2-1 here last Sunday to prompt Pochettino's outburst about the size of the pitch here at White Hart Lane.

It is complete bunkum of course, an excuse for three defeats suffered by this Spurs team in the Barclays Premier League this season.

Instead they have the familiar Spurs feel, a Cup team again as they limp past Nottingham Forest and Brighton in this competition and make headway in the Europa League.

This is a nervy Tottenham team, living on edge after defeats here against Liverpool, West Brom and Newcastle.

They have some making up to do with the fans who have been waiting for this club to take off under Daniel Levy's stewardship for more than a decade. The wait goes on.

When this team hasn't scored after five minutes you can sense the confidence seeping out of the side. Patience guys.

Soon it spreads into the stands and before you know it they are putting their knuckles in their mouths at half-time to stop themselves booing their team. It another close call here at 0-0.

To listen to Brighton's army of fans, the thousands who made it up from the south coast, chanting 'ole' towards the end of the first half would have got on their goat.

Mark Clattenburg was tap-dancing when Brighton defender Inigo Calderon and Spurs striker Harry Kane began grappling inside the area after ten minutes. 

Kane claimed he had been thrown to the deck by Calderon, who began wagging his finger in the striker's face, and demanded a penalty. Not given. 

They were stirred by Michel Vorm, in goal for Hugo Lloris, bizarrely booting the ball out for an early corner after a communication mix-up with Vertonghen. Speak to each other guys, speak.

Spurs had a couple of decent chances, but Christian Walton's debut will be remembered in his household for an awful long time.

The Brighton keeper, who is also in the England Under-19 squad, was outstanding in the first half.

His saves from Jan Vertonghen, getting down early to save a long range effort, and stopping Andros Townsend's angled effort were top drawer. Good for him.

'Chris will remember this night for the rest of his life,' admitted Hyypia. 

'Our first choice David Stockdale and a problem with his finger and Chris knew in morning that he would play. It is not an easy place to play. When we needed him he did his job very well.'

Brighton had a shout for a penalty in the first half when Kyle Naughton appeared to handle, but referee Mark Clattenburg ignored the appeals.

They had a couple of first half chances, but Kazenga LuaLua misjudged the best of them when he was put clean through down the left.

The ball skidded off the surface and the Brighton forward lashed a left foot effort high into the stands. It will eat away at him.

Danny Holla's dreamy effort, a free kick from 25 yards out, dipped over Vorm's crossbar.

It was only after the break when the tie moved in Tottenham's favour after Lennon, nursing a hamstring injury, was replaced by Lamela.

Eight minutes into the second half he combined brilliantly with Soldado, combing their way through the Brighton defence to set up the opener.

Lamela read the pass and he darted into the penalty area before sliding the ball underneath Walton. It was a superb move.

Kane, who scored three here last week and was dropped for last Sunday's defeat against Newcastle, finished off Brighton from close range.

Townsend set up Soldado and when his shot was blocked, Kane was there to pounce. That's seven for the season, all in cup competition.

That put Spurs two up and even Clattenburg felt like the job was down for Spurs.

Clattenburg, the man who took off from the Hawthorns last Saturday to make sure he made it to an Ed Sheeran concert in time, blew up before the injury time was done.

Perhaps he had somewhere else he needed to be.
