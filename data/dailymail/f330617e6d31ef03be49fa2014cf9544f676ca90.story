The daughter of a Melbourne woman who has been missing for six days says she is trying to stay positive despite fearing that she may never see her mother again. 

Concern continues to grow for the welfare of the Angelika Peters, who has not been seen since kissing her husband goodbye in their Ascot Vale home before he went to work on Thursday morning.

The 45-year-old left behind her wallet, phone and most importantly, her Epipen for her latex allergy which has developed so severely since the start of the year that she is under doctor's orders not to go out on her own for more than two hours at a time.

The family is completely baffled by Ms Peters' whereabouts and her eldest daughter Arna Dionysopoulos is struggling to make sense of her mother's mysterious disappearance.

'I have absolutely no idea if she will return – I feel like I should say she will but I’m just not sure because it's been six days,' the 25-year-old told Daily Mail Australia.  'It’s absolutely terrifying not knowing if she’s alive or not – it’s hard to actually go there in my brain.' 

Melbourne mother-of-two, Angelika Peters, who has been forced to remain housebound for the past eight months after developing a severe latex allergy, has been missing for the past six days

After working as a nurse for the past 25 years, Ms Peters was forced to give up her career when her latex allergy created too many risks for both herself and the patients.

Ms Peters had managed the allergy for at least 30 years until she became a relief nurse at the start of the year and began suffering anaphylactic reactions from too much exposure. 

A usually positive and upbeat woman, being housebound for the past eight months had started to take its toll on the former nurse. 

'It really did affect her because she loved being a nurse,' Ms Dionysopoulos said.

'Initially she was being proactive but it was just hard because she is very smart and didn’t have any stimulation which was a lot of the trouble so she tried to keep busy.'

'She might have had a bit of cabin fever because to stay alive she had to start taking really stringent care of her surroundings which was when things got harder because she had to stay away from large numbers of people.’ 

However, Ms Dionysopoulos said her mother was holding out for further tests next month in the hope to find a way to be able to return to work.

'She's such a strong person where if something is wrong she would act on it - she's not the type to run away from her problems - she always addressed them - that's what makes this very confusing and out of character,' she said.

'She has always been good at turning things into a positive - she always made the most out of situations - it was never as dire as it seemed with her.'

The family has been frantically searching for Ms Peters including handing out fliers and visiting some of her favourite places. 

Her husband Adam Gray expressed great concern for his wife as she rarely left the house - let alone on her own.

'When I say she was at home – she was at home - she wouldn't leave the house without company,' he said. 

'She would always have her Epipen with her - unfortunately due to her personal habits she was at home all of the time.' 

Mr Gray said the condition had significantly impacted on his wife's everyday life - recently she had to leave a restaurant because a balloon had set off her allergy.  

Ms Peters would usually keep in regular phone contact with her husband and youngest daughter, Jessica Dionysopoulos, 21, during the day, Arna said. 

Arna appealed to her mum that if she was feeling down to make contact and the family would help.

'I just want her to know that no matter what she is going through, and if she needs time, that we’ll understand – I just want to know that she’s OK.' 

Ms Peters was last seen wearing a blue top and dark pants and is believed to have left her Fisher Parade house on foot between 10am and midday on Thursday.

She is described as Caucasian in appearance, with brown hair and a medium build. 

Her family are very concerned as she had displayed signs of depression due to the allergy
