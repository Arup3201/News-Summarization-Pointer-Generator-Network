The BBC is too secretive and has stopped official investigators from probing its huge pay deals and IT fiascos, the head of the Government spending watchdog said yesterday.

The National Audit Office (NAO) blamed BBC ‘gatekeepers’ for stopping it from viewing key documents about financial scandals, delaying one crucial report by eight months.

The watchdog’s director, Sir Amyas Morse, called for statutory powers to force BBC bosses to hand over evidence about how it uses its annual £3.5billion licence fee revenue.

He said it can be so hard to extract information from the corporation that he has trouble keeping his staff’s morale up. Giving evidence to the Commons culture, media and sport committee, he said: ‘It is possible, particularly in difficult areas, to find the BBC doesn’t provide evidence where in their judgment it is covered by commercial or confidentiality grounds, or indeed privacy grounds.

‘There are an excessive number of gatekeepers in the organisation who feel they can apply their judgment rather than relying on our professionalism with regards to what we might see.’

The chair of the culture, media and sport committee, Tory MP John Whittingdale, agreed with his criticism: ‘There is a perception that the BBC is an enormously bloated, bureaucratic organisation, with more people carrying out a function than would be the case in any of the equivalent commercial broadcasters.’

Last year, the NAO published two damning reports exposing BBC waste.

The first found it blew £100million on a failed IT project known as the Digital Media Initiative.

The second, which revealed that the corporation handed out £369million in severance pay-offs to its staff over eight years prompted parliamentary enquiries.

But Sir Amyas revealed the Digital Media Initiative report was delayed by eight months because the BBC blocked access to key documents.

And he said there are further delays because the BBC controls when his findings are published. He added: It can be difficult to keep motivation of my people going … when they have to wait a long time for information and it holds the report up.’

The NAO can probe the financial efficiency of all Government departments and agencies, as well as police and the NHS, and has legal powers to force them to reveal documents. However, the BBC only provides access ‘by agreement’, meaning it is able to block investigators.

A BBC spokesman said: 'We welcome Sir Amyas' positive comments about the management and governance of the BBC, our work on reducing costs and targets we've achieved.

'We are committed to openness and transparency as the content of previous National Audit Office reports has shown and we have a good working relationship with the NAO which already has full access to the BBC's operations, with the exception of editorial areas, as protecting the BBC’s editorial independence is paramount.'
