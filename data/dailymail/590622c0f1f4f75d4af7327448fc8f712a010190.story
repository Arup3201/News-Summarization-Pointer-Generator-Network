Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney will headline a fundraiser celebrating New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's birthday next month.

Romney has let bygones be bygones and reaffirmed his friendship with Christie since the New Jersey politician cozied up to President Barack Obama in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy six days before the general election in 2012.

The September 10 birthday bash benefiting the New Jersey GOP is the latest in a string of political events the high-profile Republican politicians have appeared at together this year

Buds again: Former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, right, and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, left, have reaffirmed their friendship since Romney's defeat in 2012 to Barack Obama. The Republican politicians are pictured here at a town hall meeting in Ohio a few weeks before the presidential election

Once rumored
 to be on Romney's short list for vice president, Christie's relationship with the former Massachusetts governor was reportedly on the rocks after he was photographed with the president surveying the damage caused by Sandy less than a week before the presidential election.

Christie met Obama on the tarmac when he arrived in New Jersey on Air Force One and took 
an aerial tour of the devastated areas in the president's Marine One helicopter.

At a press conference afterward Christie said he 'cannot thank the president enough for his personal concern and compassion for our state and the people of our state.'

'Good
 news for all of us is that the president couldn’t have been better 
today,' Christie said during his remarks. 'He made it very clear to me today that getting New Jersey 
back to normal is his top priority, and it’s my top priority, too. We 
had a good day.'

Officially, the Romney campaign stood behind Christie, and Romney himself never uttered a harsh word against the New Jersey politician. Romney campaign 
manager Matt Rhoades even told the New York Times that Christie did 'exactly 
what a governor should do.'

But behind the scenes conservatives and Romney aides trashed Christie and blamed him in part for the Republican presidential candidate's defeat at the polls the following week.

'He went out of his way to embrace the president during the final 
week of the campaign,' a Romney adviser told National Review Online the day after the election. 'It 
wasn’t necessary and it hurt us.'

'Todd Akin, Richard Mourdock, and 
Chris Christie undermined the Republican message,' the Romney aide said,
 lumping Christie in with two Republican candidates who lost their 
Senate races because of their controversial comments on rape.

Refusing to be the scapegoat for Romney's drubbing, Christie fired back that people blaming him in the media were 'know-nothing, disgruntled Romney staffers who, you know, don't like the 
fact that I said nice things about the president of the United States.'

'I wouldn’t call what I did an embrace of Barack Obama,' Christie told reporters.

'That’s become the wording of it but the fact of the matter is, I’m a guy who tells the truth all the time. If the president of the United States did something good, I was going to say he did something good and give him credit for it.

'It doesn’t take away for a minute the fact that I was the first governor in America to endorse Mitt Romney, that I traveled literally tens of thousands of miles for him, raised tens of millions of dollars for him, and worked harder than any other surrogate in America other than Paul Ryan,' he said, referring to Romney's running mate.

Still, Christie continued to be badgered by Republicans in the weeks after the election for his contribution to the GOP's loss. At a Republican Governors Association meeting just after the election, The New York Times said Christie was overheard telling an attendee, 'I will not apologize for doing my job.'

Photos of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie meeting President Barack Obama on the tarmac when he came to New Jersey to view the damage caused by Superstorm Sandy in 2012 and Christie's laudatory remarks about Obama's response to the crisis contributed to Romney's loss in the presidential election the next week, conservatives and Romney aides claimed immediately after the election

Whatever ill will Romney may have had for Christie directly after the incident appeared to have dissipated by the time he spoke out about his blistering electoral loss for the first time nearly four months later.

'I'm not going to worry about how Chris was doing what he thought was best for the people of his state,' Romney said on Fox News Sunday. 'I lost my election because of my campaign, not because of what anyone else did.' 

Romney had verbally forgiven Christie, but the former Massachusetts Governor publicly kept his distance from the potential presidential candidate despite endorsing him for reelection in his Governor's race in 2013.

It was not until earlier this year during the Bridgegate scandal that the two men joined forces again, coming together to raise money for the Republican Governors Association, an organization of which Christie is the chair. They've continued to appear at political events together since, including one last month in Utah and the upcoming event in East Brunswick, New Jersey.

According to an invitation obtained by Politico, admission to the fundraiser honoring is $150 and entry to the private reception with Romney is $5,000. Guests also have the option of giving the legal maximum in contributions to the New Jersey Republican State Committee - $25,000- to attend a roundtable with Romney.

Instead of gifts, the political party asks that attendees bring an 'unwrapped children's toy' to be donated to Toys for Tots.

Christie enthusiasts who can't afford to attend the fundraiser can show their support for the second-term Governor by paying $15 to have their name listed in the committee's birthday card to him.
