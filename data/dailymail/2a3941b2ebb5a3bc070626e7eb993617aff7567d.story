David Cameron taunted the Scottish National Party for delaying an independence vote by telling MPs today that ‘it is not a referendum they want, it's a never-endum’.

The Prime Minister ratcheted up the war of words with Alex Salmond by suggesting his party are avoiding a real debate about Scotland leaving the UK because they are worried about losing it.

Polls suggest that less than a third of voters north of the border would back ending the 300-year union if a referendum was held now. The SNP leader wants the vote to be held in 2014.

War of words: David Cameron challenged Alex Salmond (right) to a real debate but said the SNP 'don't want to talk about the 
substance' of deciding whether Scotland leaves the 300-year-old union with England

Mr Cameron, who has suggested that a 
vote may only be considered legally binding by the UK Government if it 
is held within 18 months, said: ‘Let's have the debate and let's keep 
our country together.’

He told the House of Commons during Prime Minister’s Questions: ‘I passionately believe in the future of our United Kingdom.

‘I passionately believe we are stronger together rather than breaking apart.

‘Frankly, I am sad we are even having
this debate, because I support the United Kingdom so strongly, but we 
have to respect the fact that Scotland voted for a separatist party at 
the Scottish parliamentary elections.

More than half of Scottish voters want to remain in the United Kingdom, according to a poll released today.

Some 54 per cent of people in Scotland questioned by Ipsos Mori for the thinktank British Future said they wanted to stay in the Union - compared to just 29 per cent who backed independence.

The poll, released as the Government set out its position on the terms of any referendum on independence, also showed similar majorities in both England and Wales in favour of Scotland staying in the UK.

According to the survey, voters north of the border are slightly more enthusiastic about preserving the Union than people in England or Wales.

Some 48 per cent of those questioned in England backed the Union, against 27 per cent who supported independence for Scotland.In Wales, 41 per cent wanted Scotland to stay in the UK, while 29 per cent said it should become independent.

Support for the Union was stronger among older people, with six out of 10 over-55s wanting Scotland to stay in the UK, compared to four out of 10 of those aged 16-44.

Independence for Scotland was more popular among men (32 per cent) than women (23 per cent).

And middle-class professionals were more likely to want to keep the Union (53 per cent) than those in lower skilled posts (46 per cent) or unskilled jobs (44 per cent).

Ipsos Mori interviewed 2,320 people across Great Britain between November 30 and December 6, including 497 in Scotland.

‘The first thing that is right to do 
is to make clear the legal position about a referendum, and that is what
the Scotland Secretary (Michael Moore) has been doing.

‘We have made the offer that we will 
devolve the power to hold that referendum, so a referendum can be made 
in Scotland and held in Scotland.

‘Frankly, I look forward to having 
the debate because I think there have been too many in the SNP who are 
happy to talk about the process, but they don't want to talk about the 
substance.

‘I sometimes think when I listen to them that it is not a referendum they want, it's a never-endum.’

The Prime Minister was backed by 
Labour leader Ed Miliband as the two main Westminster parties joined 
together in pledging to fight for Scotland to remain part of the United 
Kingdom.

Mr Miliband called on supporters of the Union to make a positive case for its continuation.

He warned the Commons: ‘This is a 
momentous decision which our children and grandchildren will have to 
live with if we get it wrong.’

Mr Miliband called for immediate 
cross-party talks to deal with the process of how a single-question 
referendum can be held under the oversight of the Electoral Commission.

But he said it was vital that 
pro-Union politicians move quickly on to debating the substance of the 
issues surrounding independence for Scotland.

‘We on this side of the House believe
the United Kingdom benefits the people of Scotland and the people of 
the rest of the United Kingdom in equal measure,’ said the Labour 
leader.

‘We are stronger together and weaker apart.

‘We must make the case for the Union -
not simply against separatism, but the positive case about the shared 
benefits to us all of Scotland's part in the United Kingdom, the shared 
economic interests, the shared institutions like the NHS, our defence 
forces and the BBC and above all the shared values we hold together.’

Mr Miliband added: ‘We need a 
serious, thoughtful and inclusive debate on what the choices are and the
benefits to Scotland of staying in the UK.

‘On this one issue, the people of our
country deserve nothing less than that serious debate about the 
benefits of the United Kingdom.’

Mr Cameron responded that he was in ‘100 per cent agreement’ with his opponent.

The display of unity came a day after
Mr Salmond told Westminster politicians to ‘butt out’ of the debate 
over the timing and format of the referendum.

Scotland's nationalist government reacted with fury yesterday to the Prime Minister's attempts to wrestle control back from First Minister Alex Salmond (pictured right)

He also said the referendum would be 
held in Autumn 2014 - a date that appears to have been selected so it 
falls just a few weeks after the 700th anniversary of the Battle of 
Bannockburn, Scotland’s most famous military victory over England, and 
when Mr Salmond hopes resentment over Government spending cuts will be 
at its height.

Mr Salmond said he was ‘staggered’ 
that Westminster was seeking to close down the possibility of a third 
option in a referendum.

Support: Ed Miliband backed the Prime Minister over Scotland in a show of unity between the two main Westminster parties

He believes Scottish voters may be 
more likely to back so-called ‘devo max’ – an extended version of 
devolution that would see fiscal autonomy for Scotland but see it remain
in the UK – than full independence.

His outburst followed the UK 
Government's publication yesterday of a paper which argued that the 
Holyrood Parliament has no power to call a poll.

The consultation paper proposed that 
the Westminster Parliament could make an order to devolve power to 
Holyrood to stage a ballot on the single question of independence, which
could take place within the next 18 months.

But Scottish National Party MP Angus 
Robertson today accused Mr Cameron of following in the footsteps of 
Margaret Thatcher by seeking to dictate to Scotland.

‘The Scottish Government was elected 
with an overwhelming mandate to deliver an independence referendum in 
the second half of the parliamentary term,’ Mr Robertson told MPs.

‘In contrast the Conservative Party has less Members of Parliament (in Scotland) than there are giant pandas in Edinburgh Zoo.

‘So why is the Prime Minister trying to emulate Margaret Thatcher by dictating to Scotland?’

Mr Cameron said it was ‘quite the opposite’ as the Government was offering Scotland the power to hold a legal referendum.

He added: ‘Right across this House there is uniform belief that that needs to happen.’

Labour’s Scotland Act of 1998, which 
established devolution, and was supposed to close down the question of 
Scottish independence, states explicitly that the question of ‘the Union
of the Kingdoms of Scotland and England’ will remain a matter reserved 
to Westminster.
