Jamie Gant, 11, died after being rushed to hospital from his home in Bath

A popular 11-year-old schoolboy was found hanged in his bedroom minutes after telling his mother he was going upstairs to finish his homework.

Jamie Gant died after being rushed to hospital when his mother discovered his lifeless body in their home in Twerton, Bath. 

The child, who had just started secondary school, had never shown any intention to take his own life, an inquest into his death heard.

Avon Coroner's Court heard how Jamie had told his mother he was going to finish his homework on September 28.

Ten minutes later, his lifeless body was found in his bedroom. Paramedics arrived at the family home and rushed Jamie to Bath Royal Infirmary where he was pronounced dead. 

'There was absolutely no indication that there was anything contributing to the death, or anything else people had been aware of,' Detective Sergeant Tom Herbert of Avon and Somerset Constabulary said. 

'Everyone felt Jamie was a very happy boy, very popular at school and he had been able to speak to them if he had been concerned as he had in the past. 

'There was no evidence of bullying.' 

Recording a narrative conclusion, Coroner Maria Voisin said the child may not have intended to kill himself. 

'I’m told Jamie was a lovely, popular boy and there is no mention of anything that would have led to, or caused an intention, in relation to this.

'There is clearly the act which resulted in Jamie’s death, but I do not consider I have enough evidence to answer whether the intention of Jamie was to take his life.

'He may not have realised that death was the conclusion of his act.'

Jamie's parents paid tribute to their son as a 'happy and loved young boy'. 

'Jamie, was a much loved and very happy young boy who had a bright future which has been sadly cut short.

'He will be deeply missed by family friends and all who knew him,' a statement read. 

The 11-year-old was taken to The Royal United Hospital in Bath (above) but was pronounced dead
