Arms folded tightly to her chest, a  shopper winces in alarm as she finds herself surrounded by a swarm of bees – on a busy street in Central London.

Around 5,000 of the insects descended on a branch of Topshop yesterday, sending passers-by scrambling for cover.

Witnesses said they could ‘hardly see the sky’ as the colony made a nest on the bustling high street.

A swarm of 5,000-strong honeybees that have been attracted to a discount sign on the window of Topshop in Victoria Street, central London, today

Meanwhile, in Southsea student George Heal, 21, was shocked to find his Nissan Micra, parked outside his home, covered in a swarm of 20,000 bees. 

Experts said it's common for honeybees to swarm around and set up new hives at this time of year.

The marine biology student said: 'One of my housemates pointed my car out to me and it was just surrounded by bees.

'It’s not something you see every day. I believe they are all gone now but I will definitely be checking the car before I get in it.'

The unusual nesting places for the bees are picked by the Queen bee, who lands there first and are quickly followed by her devoted colony.

Honeybees eyes
 are more sensitive to ultraviolet colours, which Gill Maclean from the 
British Beekeepers Association (BBKA) says could be why they were attracted to 
the green sign and the car.

'It
 is in their nature to look for bright flowers and colours. Also when 
they swarm they generally hang from the branch of a tree so it is a 
possibility they could be attracted to the green for that reason.'

Scores of Londoners stopped to take photographs of the unusual sight outside Topshop, in the heart of busy central London.

Tony Mann, a project manager at nearby John Lewis and a trained bee keeper, dashed over to the shop to help lead efforts to smoke the European honeybee colony out.

Mr Mann, who donned a white bee keeping costume and netted hat for the tricky task, said: 'We have either had a virgin Queen or an old Queen, she has left the nest and she has brought the warm and settled on the shop front.'

Honeybees have been providing humans with honey for centuries and play an important role in the pollination process.

But in recent years the species has come  under threat and beekeepers have seen the numbers dwindle.

It
 has been estimated that the number of British honeybees has halved over
 the last 25 years and scientists claim there are only enough to 
properly pollinate a quarter of the country’s crops.

Experts have warned that the 
collapse of bee colonies could trigger a farming crisis, but why 
populations are being hit so hard has remained largely a mystery.

It is thought populations could have plummeted as the insect’s meadowland habitats were concreted over and their wildflower food supply killed by herbicides.

A
 recent study by the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) in 
Cambridge, Massachusetts, has added weight to the theory that even low 
doses of an insecticide have an adverse effect on hives.

He said some of the bees were flying around the area 'like scouts to try to find out where the next best place to go is'.

The colony was later safely moved across the road to Westminster Cathedral, where it will be looked after by beekeepers on top of the Catholic church's roof.

It is not known where the bees originally came from, but a string of shops in the local area do have their own hives.

David Beamont, operations manager at the Victoria Business Improvement District (BID), which manages the interests of businesses in the area, said trained keepers arrived quickly on the scene to deal with the situation.

He said: 'In Victoria there are over a dozen experienced beekeepers who have all been on an intense training course that focuses on the theory and practical training of urban beekeeping, successfully managing hives for nearly two years.

'Local beekeepers were able to respond swiftly to manage the swarm, collect them in a mobile hive and move them to a suitable location. Our ambassadors were also on site to reassure members of the public that the bees were not distressed.'

Ruth Duston, CEO of Victoria BID, said local businesses kept bees to boost the area's biodiversity.

She said: 'With a falling national bee population, the bees in Victoria play a key role in showing that London is a healthy, liveable city.'

Mrs Maclean, from BBKA, said: ‘They are doing 
what honey bees do naturally and are not remotely interested in humans.

'In
 fact before leaving their hive the bees fill up their stomachs with 
honey and are rather mellow; their sole intention is to find a new home 
to build-up a new colony.

'As
 long as the swarm is not provoked it will not do any harm but it is 
important that the bees are collected by an experienced beekeeper.

'If left 
to their own devices they may choose to set up home in the nearest 
convenient spot which could be a chimney or other inaccessible place.'

She added that in central London people often keep bees on rooftops: 'The urban scene is not necessarily a paradise for bees.

'A
 very high percentage of the urban area is barren bricks and mortar, 
concrete and tarmac and many grassy open spaces offer little of interest
 to bees, so forage is limited and consequently the number of hives that
 can be sustained limited too,' she said.

'Another
 key factor when keeping bees in towns and cities is the siting of hives
 and their management to ensure that there is minimal nuisance to 
neighbours and the general public.

'Proper
 training in beekeeping skills is vital to be able to assess suitability
 of apiary sites and to be able to manage colonies to minimise swarming 
and the likelihood for stinging events involving the public.'
