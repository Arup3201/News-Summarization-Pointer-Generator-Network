An Ohio man was freed from prison after serving more than 20 years for a murder he claims he did not commit.

Dewey Jones, 51, had been in prison since being convicted of the 1991 murder of 71-year-old family friend Neil Rankin and was released after DNA testing disputed that conviction despite not exonerating him.

Mr Jones was originally convicted in March 1995 of robbing, beating and shooting to death at his Akron home. Further evidence testing found another person’s DNA on the rope used to tie Mr Ranking before his murder, but it was not Jones’.

‘I knew [this day] would come, I just never thought it would take this long,’ the wild-haired man told NewsNet 5. ‘The truth is the truth and it always comes out.’

Mr Jones was set free despite authorities not declaring his outright innocence, he repeatedly claimed the truth had finally come out.

When asked what he thinks the truth is, the freed man said ‘I sure would like to know who I did 20 years for, I wish I knew what the whole truth was.’

Authorities have reserved the right to implicate him again should they see fit, but are not likely to retry the case due to a combination of witnesses passing away and evidence deterioration, according to the Akron Beacon Journal.

The defiant man practically dared prosecutors to haul him back in.

‘I’m ready to go to trial tomorrow, take me to trial, I’m ready,’ he said, becoming short of breath.. ‘I had nothing to do with it, no knowledge of it… they know it.’

Mr Jones, who according to records had previously been convicted of drug trafficking and passing bad checks, credited both DNA testing and the Innocence Project for his release.

‘That’s what probably saved me, what probably brought the truth out.'

DNA testing done on the knife used to cut the rope to tie Mr Rankin down while he was killed, as well as the victim’s bloody shirt, did not match Mr Jones. It indicated another person was at the scene, according to NewsNet 5

The Summit County Prosecutor’s Office referred the case to the Ohio Attorney General for further review to see if a retrial was possible while his lawyers argued for dismissal with prejudice, which would prevent another trial.

‘The anxiety and fear of having them come back after you in the future is something that we definitely want to eliminate,’ David Owens, of The Exoneration Project, told NewsNet 5.

Both Mr Jones’ lawyers and state officials have until February 10 to formally file their requests.
