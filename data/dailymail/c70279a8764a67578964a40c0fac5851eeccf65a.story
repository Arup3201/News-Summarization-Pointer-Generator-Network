More than 50 mysterious shapes have been discovered etched into the landscape of northern Kazakhstan.

The shapes – which include a swastika, circles, crosses and squares - range in size from 300 to 1300ft (90 to 400 metres).

Known as geoglyphs, they were found using Google Earth and researchers now hope they will reveal details about ancient rituals in the area.

Over 50 mysterious shapes have been discovered etched into the landscape of northern Kazakhstan. They include a swastika (pictured). While this shape is now associated with the Nazis, swastikas were in fact an ancient symbol used for over 3,000 years to depict prosperity and power

'As of today, we can only say one thing - the geoglyphs were built by ancient people. By whom and for what purpose, remains a mystery,' Kostanay archaeologists Irina Shevnina and Andrew Logvin told Owen Jarus at LiveScience

The symbols were discovered in Northern Kazakhstan, however, geoglyphs can be found all over the world

One structure appeared to be a swastika. While the symbol may now be associated with Nazis, it was in fact an ancient symbol used for more than 3,000 years to depict prosperity and power.

For example, in Indo-European culture a swastika was a mark made on people to give them good luck. The word itself is derived from the Sanskrit 'svastika' and means 'good to be'.

After finding the geoglyphs on Google Earth, archaeologists from Kostanay University in Kazakhstan and Vilnius University in Lithuania have been using radar to better understand the structure.

The team excavated the sites and found remnants of ancient structures and fireplaces, suggesting the locations were for rituals.

Geoglyphs are works of art made by etching shapes into the earth or moving objects, such as stones, within a landscape.

They can be found all over the world, with the most famous example is Peru's Nazca Lines.

Experts believe the Nazca used to dance along the lines of the geoglyphs when they prayed for rain - and many of the same images appear on Nazca pottery.

As well as Peru's Nazca Lines and the strange shapes in Khazakstan, archaeologists have found thousands of wheel-shaped geoglyphs in the Middle East.

Most of the shapes were created by creating mounds in the earth, but the swastika was arranged using wood.

'As of today, we can only say one thing - the geoglyphs were built by ancient people. By whom and for what purpose, remains a mystery,' Kostanay archaeologists Irina Shevnina and Andrew Logvin told Owen Jarus at LiveScience.

The team isn't sure why exactly the geoglyphs were created, but they say it may have served to mark out territory.

Geoglyphs can be found all over the world, with the most famous example is Peru's Nazca Lines.

Last month the mysteries of the Nazca Lines carved into the Peruvian desert have intensified after gales and sandstorms revealed previously unseen ancient designs.

A pilot discovered a geoglyph of what appears to be a 196ft-long (60 metre) snake, as well as a type of camelid - such as a llama - above an unidentified bird.

These new lines join existing geoglyphs of a dog, hummingbird, condor and a monkey, thought to have been drawn by the ancient Nazca people between the first and sixth centuries.

Experts believe the Nazca used to dance along the lines of the geoglyphs when they prayed for rain - and many of the same images appear on Nazca pottery.

An animal-shaped stone structure that may predate Peru's Nazca Lines have also been discovered in Russia, near Lake Zjuratkul in the Ural Mountains, north of Kazakhstan.
