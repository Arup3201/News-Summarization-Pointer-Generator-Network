A German man had to be tied up on board an airplane after he tried to smoke during the flight and got violent when staff tried to stop him.

Mathias Jorg, 54, lit up several times on a 7Â½ hour flight from Singapore to Brisbane and had to be detained by staff after he allegedly became aggressive.

A photograph taken on the plane by a fellow passenger, show Mr Jorg with his legs and arms tied up, surrounded by cabin crew.

Held down: Mathias Jorg, a German national, is restrained for smoking on an international flight to Brisbane, Australia from Singapore on January 2

When the Emirates Air flight landed in Brisbane just after 1am on Thursday morning, Mr Jorg was taken into police custody.

He appeared before Brisbane Magistrates Court later the same day, charged with one count of smoking on an aircraft, one count of assaulting crew and one count of assaulting crew affecting the performance of their duty.

Mr Jorg had to use a German interpreter during his court visit, and claimed that he had been injured during the restraining.

He has been allowed bail after promising to surrender his passport to the Australian Federal Police and make no applications for another, and that he would not leave Australia or go within 100 metres of any place of international departure.

On bail: Mr Jorg appeared before Brisbane Magistrates Court on Thursday, wearing plasters on his wrists and with a bruised forehead, where he had to relinquish his German passport

Although he initially protested through his interpreter, explaining that he didn't 'trust' the conditions of the court, he eventually agreed to give up his passport, Courier Mail reports.

He will appear before Brisbane Magistrates Court again on January 10.

Although there is no internationally agreed convention covering restraining passengers on airplanes, what cabin crews are allowed to do to control unruly passengers is governed by the laws of the country where the airplane is registered.

The decision to restrain a passenger is in the hands of the captain, who also must notify authorities at the destination and give the reason for the restraint.
