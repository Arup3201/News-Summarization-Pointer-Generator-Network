It's enough to get your knickers in a serious knot - with the price of your favourite underwear and t-shirts set to soar for the first time in several years because of the rapidly descending Australian dollar.

With the local currency crashing to five-year lows, even dipping below the 80 US cent mark, the fear is the prices of cheap imports will soon head in the opposite direction.

Most of the major department stores stock their shelves with garments produced in Asia, via wholesalers; including China, Thailand and Bangladesh. And even the bargains usually available at market stalls will inevitably be hit.

Underwear is likely to rise significantly in cost for the first time in several years as a result of the falling Australian dollar

Retailers are facing increased costs, as their wholesalers importing normally cheaper priced items, struggle to cope with the dipping Aussie currency

Favourites for consumers like cheaper imported underwear and t-shirts could soar to their highest levels in more than five years because of the dipping currency.

'I have no doubt that a lot of retailers, ourselves included, will inevitably have to put prices up because the dollar is devalued,' Eric Morris, the chief executive of PAS Group, told The Age newspaper's Business Day.

PAS Group boasts several of its own labels but also produces brands for larger retailers, among their clients are the likes of Myer, Target and BIG W.

Mr Morris admitted that he couldn't be sure how much prices would go up as 'it will differ brand by brand'.

The Australian dollar has had 17 per cent of value against the American Greenback wiped from it in the past eight months

Department stores could increase the price of some clothing by up to six per cent if the weaker Australian dollar continues its slide

The Australian dollar slid to 79.35 US cents on Thursday

Some analysts warn that if wholesalers ratchet up the costs, the increase at the department store could be upwards of five to six per cent.

'The industry in the past hasn't handled price increases well, it's going to be a challenge for ­suppliers and retailers to maintain those price increases,' Credit Suisse analyst Grant Saligari told The Age.

'Volume falls and then they wind up giving some or all of it back in promotions and specials,' he said.

The Australian dollar has been weighed down by falling iron ore and oil prices.

On Thursday, the local unit was trading at 79.35 US cents, down from 80 cents on Wednesday.

Westpac senior market strategist Imre Speizer said concerns about the policies of the new Greek government and the possibility of an interest rate cut here are putting downward pressure on the Australian dollar.

'Commodities continued to slump, the CRB (Commodity Research Bureau) index down 1.3 per cent to a six-year low,' he said.

The recent fall is decisive as 80 US cents is considered psychologically significant, a mark which the Aussie dollar has been flirting with since the European Central Bank announced its massive stimulus package.

With the rising cost of imports caused by a weaker Australian dollar, underwear shopping could become a whole lot dearer in 2015

Some analysts say some imported underwear will have to increase in cost, perhaps to their highest level in several years, because of the weakening Australian dollar

LTG GoldRock director Andrew Barnett said 'there’s a huge support level at US80c for the Aussie dollar, but if the Aussie closes under that for a day or two, with a bit of weakness we could see US75c in the next six or eight weeks'.

Mr Barnett is confident the Australian dollar will keep falling, which will stop the Reserve Bank of Australia from cutting the cash rate.

'Glenn Stevens doesn’t want to put interest rates down, he’d prefer not to and if the Aussie dollar is going under US80c, drifting towards US75c I think the RBA will hold fire,' he said.
