 The Oscars have been plunged into a race row over the fact that all the nominees in the four acting categories are white.

American civil rights activist Reverend Al Sharpton said yesterday: ‘The movie industry is like the Rocky Mountains – the higher you get, the whiter it gets.’

Sharpton, 60, a critic of the lack of diversity in the US movie industry, added: ‘I have called an emergency meeting early next week in Hollywood … to discuss possible action around the Academy Awards.’

Reverend Al Sharpton has said the Oscar nominations are 'appallingly insulting' and compared Hollywood to the Rocky Mountains, saying the higher you get 'the whiter it gets'

Rev Sharpton  said David Oyelowo, left, should have been nominated for his performance as the late Reverend Martin Luther King, and the movie's director, Ava DuVernay, should have also received a nomination

The civil rights film Selma, based on Dr Martin Luther King’s marches, has been nominated for best picture – but its British star David Oyelowo, who plays King, did not make the shortlist for best actor.

Selma’s director, Ava Duvernay, had been tipped to be the first black woman ever nominated for best director, after she was shortlisted for last weekend’s Golden Globes. But she, too, was locked out of Oscar contention in another all-white category.

Sharpton said: ‘The lack of diversity in the Oscar nominations is appalling and while it is good that Selma was nominated for best picture, it’s ironic that they nominated a story about the racial shut-out around voting while there is a racial shut-out around the Oscar nominations.

‘With all of the talent in Selma and other black movies this year, it is hard to believe that we have less diversity in the nominations today than in recent history.’

The lack of ethnic variety prompted campaigners to take to social networking site Twitter and create the online trend #OscarsSoWhite.

Best Picture nomination: Birdman received nine nods in total, one for Best Picture, it was announced on Thursday morning by the Academy Of Motion Pictures Arts And Sciences

On the list: The Grand Budapest Hotel, starring Ralph Fiennes, also got a nod

Selma, starring Colman Domingo, David Oyelowo, André Holland and Stephan James, was produced by Brad Pitt's Plan B Entertainment and Oprah Winfrey

The 2011 Oscars also featured an exclusively white crop of 20 acting nominees, the first time that had happened since 1998.

But award watchers claim this is ‘the whitest Oscars’ in years and a reminder of the slow pace of change in Hollywood, even after what looked like progress for black actors and filmmakers last year stemming from the best picture winner, 12 Years A Slave.

All 20 actors nominated in the four acting categories this year are white and no women are nominated for either best director or screenwriter.

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has some 6,000 members. Tom O’Neil, founder of awards tracker Gold Derby, said: ‘The Academy is about 90 per cent white and 70 per cent male and we’re seeing the sad result of that in voting.’

Clint Eastwood's Navy SEAL drama American Sniper did especially well, landing six nods including best actor for Bradley Cooper

As studios have focused more and more on easily marketed blockbusters, Oscar season increasingly exists apart from the regular business of the movies, in its own highfalutin, red-carpeted realm.

Ratings are on the rise. Last year's Oscars, hosted by Ellen DeGeneres, drew 43 million viewers, making it the most-watched entertainment telecast in a decade. 12 Years a Slave took best picture. 

This year's ceremony will be hosted by Neil Patrick Harris.

Shortly after the announcement, the host shared a video on his Twitter page.

He told his 12.9million followers: 'The Oscar nominations just came out this morning and that can only mean one thing – I just lost 20 bucks.'

Neil then turned to his four-year-old daughter Harper and handed her the cash, claiming he had bet on who would be up for Best Credit Design Of A Foreign Language Film – a made up category. 

The new host: Neil Patrick Harris is taking a stab at hosting the 87th Academy Awards on February 22
