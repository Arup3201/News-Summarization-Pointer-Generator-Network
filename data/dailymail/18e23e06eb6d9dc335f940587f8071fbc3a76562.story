A report by the Centre for Business and Economic Research says an independent Scotland's start up costs would be ten times more than Alex Salmond has predicted 

An independent Scotland would require ‘start up costs’ of £2.5billion – ten times more than Alex Salmond has claimed – according to an expert report.

The respected Centre for Business and Economic Research has warned the costs of creating the tax and welfare systems, defence force and a network of embassies would be vast.

And if Mr Salmond has to set up a new currency, as UK ministers have refused to let a separate Scotland use the pound, the cost could increase by another £2billion.

Mr Salmond has refused to publish his own figures but has suggested that a £250million price tag – less than the cost of the Scottish Parliament – was ‘reasonable’.

Critics warned that the report paints a dire picture of the impact of separation on Scotland’s finances and public spending.

The report also warns that an independent Scotland would have to borrow £12billion a year, raise taxes or slash public spending to plug the gap in Mr Salmond’s economic plans.

Anne McGuire, a Scottish Labour MP, said: ‘This latest expert analysis confirms what we already know – independence isn’t a price worth paying.

‘The SNP are asking us to take on all these extra costs to try to replicate what we already have today. Where is the sense in every Scottish family paying through the nose for something we already have today as part of the UK?’ Any money spent on start-up costs is money that could be spent on schools or hospitals.’

The CEBR report increases pressure on the Scottish Government to publish research on start-up costs before Scots go to the polls on 18 September.

The figures, which represents about £1,000 for every Scottish household, includes £1 billion for new tax and welfare systems, £400 million for a defence force and £450 million for foreign office real estate and offices, including about 100 embassies and consular offices.

A Scottish intelligence agency could add £200 million, based on Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon’s estimate, while membership of the European Union, United Nations and Nato could cost millions more, CEBR said.

John Swinney, the Finance Secretary, asked officials to come up with a figure more than two years ago, but it was not included in last year’s White Paper on independence.

Ministers have since said they cannot even provide an estimate prior to negotiations with the UK Government – which will only happen in the event of a Yes vote.

The Treasury has predicted the true cost of a separate Scotland would be between £1.5billion and £2.7billion.

Despite this, Mr Salmond still described an estimate by Professor Patrick Dunleavy, of the London School of Economics, of £250million as ‘reasonable’.

Sam Alderson, economist at the CEBR, who wrote the report, said: ‘Setting up the kind of modern state that Scotland is used to is not going to be cheap even with the capacity it already has, and even with a reasonable amount of negotiations between the two states in terms of asset division.

‘In the long run there is more viability within it, but this is a speed bump to get over and Scotland will need a sensible approach from the Scottish and UK governments to successfully get this through because there is considerable risk.’

Mr Alderson said sharing the pound with the rest of the UK would be ‘fairly painless’ in the short term – but a new currency would have to be launched sooner or later.

The circulation of new notes and coins, and the creation of a central bank, would cost a further £2billion, they estimated.

An SNP spokesperson said: ‘The definitive expert report on set-up costs was published in June by Professor Patrick Dunleavy of the LSE. That report was a total vindication of the Scottish Government’s position, and put costs at around £200 million, a figure which he made clear could be offset by savings and efficiencies – and also a figure which the Scottish Secretary said he did not disagree with.’
