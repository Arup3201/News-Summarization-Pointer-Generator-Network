The poetry professor accused of sending 'racist and sexist' emails has resigned from Sydney University after he was suspended from work in October.

The emails included slurs against Indigenous AFL player and Australian Of The Year recipient Adam Goodes and appear to be sent to numerous friends and colleagues of Professor Barry Spurr over two years.

In another email referring to a woman who was sexually assaulted by a colleague who 'put his penis in her mouth' while she slept, Mr Spurr allegedly responded with 'Ye gods. I think she needs a lot put in her mouth, permanently, and then stitched up'.

A statement from The University of Sydney on Friday said: 'Professor Barry Spurr has submitted his resignation and the University has accepted it.

'At Professor Spurr’s request, the University will provide no further comment on this matter.'

A number of racist and sexist emails allegedly sent by  University of Sydney Professor Barry Spurr have been leaked by news website New Matilda

In one email, Mr Spurr allegedly mocks Indigenous AFL player and Australian Of The Year recipient Adam Goodes

After a first round of emails were leaked, further emails were published by website New Matilda in response to Mr Spurr's claims that he was quoted out of context and his defence that they had been sent during a 'whimsical linguistic game' largely to one other recipient. 

'An Aborigine, a sportsman [footballer], his mother one of the "Stolen Generation",' Mr Spurr allegedly wrote of Mr Goodes.

'Ticking all the correct boxes. Now all we need to know is that he suffers from 'depression' and has a disability, and he becomes the complete role model for Australians today.  

'In his acceptance speech, all he talked about was racism and every time he said "Australia" he mispronounced it.'

'Abbott wants this so he can combine it with the inclusion of Abos in the Constitution later this year… to show that he really is a sensitive guy after all.' 

Mr Spirr told Fairfax that the exchange was a pastime 'that mocked extreme language', saying the comments were 'largely to one recipient with whom I have had a whimsical linguistic game for many years of trying to outdo one another in extreme statements'. 

'Abbott wants this [for Goodes to be titled Australian Of The Year]  so he can combine it with the inclusion of Abos in the Constitution later this year,' Spurr allegedly wrote

However, New Matilda says the emails, which were allegedly sent between late 2012 and 2014, had been sent between Mr Spurr and numerous colleagues and friends. 

Two separate emails, one sent in February 2013 and the other in January 2014, include the following comments from Mr Spurr's on various video links: 'no fatties, darkies or chinky-poos' and 'No Abos, Chinky-poos, Mussies, graffiti, piercings, jeans, tattoos. BCP in all Anglican chruches; Latin Mass in all Roman ones. Not a woman to be seen in a sanctuary anywhere. And no obese fatsoes'

Another email allegedly shows Mr Spurr calling a house in which an Aboriginal family live 'a rubbish tip: human and material'. 

New Matilda disputed claims by Mr Spurr that the emails were a 'whimsical linguistic game' between himself and one recipient by releasing almost 20 of the emails that were sent between late 2012 and 2014 to numerous colleagues and friends

He wrote: '...it is now utterly destroyed, with its contents and smashed up fabric vomited out onto [a street], the pile impregnated with empty booze bottles, awaiting the Council special garbage collection for trashed housing. 

'These are the people whose "ancient wisdom", our V-C says, we should respect, and to whom we apologise on every possible occasion and whose rich culture we bow down before, confessing our wickedness in our mistreatment of them.'

Another email, it is alleged Professor Spurr called the Chancellor of Sydney University as an 'appalling minx'..

Professor Spurr was employed at The University of Sydney as Personal Chair in Poetry and Poetics but was suspended by the university on Friday 

The allegations against Professor Spurr, who took charge of examining nationwide English courses, came just days after results of the National Curriculum Review were released.

Despite claims from the Labor party that the review is 'tainted', education minister Christopher Pyne has refused to review the new curriculum for bias, according to the ABC.

However, a spokesperson for Mr Pyne told Fairfax Media: 'the minister utterly rejects and finds repugnant the denigration of any minority on the basis of their sex, race, sexual orientation or beliefs'.

As part of his role in reviewing the national curriculum, Professor Spurr made the recommendation to reduce study into the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander language.

Sydney University students rallied outside the city campus on Friday calling for the sacking of Professor Spurr for the racist, sexist and derogatory comments in the email exchange

In one of the emails released by New Matilda on Sunday, sent on April 19 2014, Mr Spurr is alleged to complain about being sent 300 pages to read by Mr Pyne for the completion of the review.

'And whereas the local curriculuim has the phrase 'Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander' on virtually every one of its 300 pages, the Californian curriculum does not ONCE mention native Americans and has only a very slight representation of African-American literature (which, unlike Abo literature, actually exists and has some distinguished productions),' Mr Spurr apparently wrote.

'[A fellow University academic] tells me that at her grand-daughter's school – [in Sydney] - every day begins with an acknowledgement of the orignal [sic] owners of the land. No flag-raising or national anthem - just this, every day. On the school's website, it proclaims that it prides itself on its 'atheletics' [sic] program.

'If ever an education system needed a bomb under it, it's ours.'

They also attached a note to the Professor's office door which dubbed him the 'professor of bigotry'

Mr Spurr told the New Matilda his recommendations in the review were made with his 'considered professional view and not in any way influenced by these email exchanges which are linguistic play'.

Professor Spurr said he was shocked that anyone would take the language used in the emails seriously as he always treated his students - no matter what background they are from - equally.

The University of Sydney  suspended Professor  Spurr's employment in October after initial reports that offensive emails, including one which referred to Prime Minister Tony Abbott as an 'abo lover', had been sent from his university account.

Christopher Pyne had responded to the claims and said he was disgusted by the alleged slurs but will not review the new curriculum for bias 

'Professor Spurr is suspended, effective immediately, from teaching and engaging in any other University business and is precluded from attending any University campus, while the matter is investigated and dealt with in accordance with the terms of the University’s Enterprise Agreement,' the university said in a statement.

'Racist, sexist or offensive language is not tolerated at the University of Sydney. The expectations for our staff and affiliates in respect of their professional and personal conduct are clearly set out in the University’s Code of Conduct.' 

Daily Mail Australia has approached Professor Barry Spurr for comment on this matter.
