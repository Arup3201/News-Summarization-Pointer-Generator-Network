David Cameron is to lead a trade delegation to China, in signs of a thawing in relations with Britain.

The Prime Minister says it wants to ‘forge a relationship that will benefit both our countries’ after causing a diplomatic row by meeting the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama.

The visit is considered so important Mr Cameron has demanded George Osborne delay his Autumn Statement on the economy for 24 hours.

Speech: David Cameron used his speech at the Lord Mayor's Banquet to announce that he is to lead a new trade delegation to China

Mr Cameron’s trip comes after Mr Osborne and London Mayor Boris Johnson visited China last month.

The Prime Minister had reportedly been effectively from visiting the Far Eastern superpower because of anger in Beijing over his decision to meet the Dalai Lama last year.

The Chinese government always lobbies hard against ministers from foreign governments meeting the Dalai Lama, who is seeking a measure of self-rule for his homeland.

However, Mr Cameron used his speech to the Lord Mayor's banquet at the Guildhall to announce his trip in early December.

He said: ‘As China’s new leadership sets its direction for the next ten years, as their country’s star continues to rise in the world, I will take senior British Ministers - as well as business leaders from every sector large and small - to forge a relationship that will benefit both our countries and bring real rewards for our peoples.

‘Opening the way for British companies to benefit from China’s vast and varied markets and preparing the way for a new level of Chinese investment into the UK.

‘This is a relationship that is for the long term, that matters for Britain and China, and which I look forward to continuing to strengthen in the months and years to come.’

In his visit last month, Mr Osborne 
announced that Chinese firms would be allowed to invest in a new 
generation of nuclear power stations while visa restrictions would be 
relaxed to encourage high-spending Chinese to come to London.

In
his speech, Mr Cameron - who is leading trade visits to India and the 
Gulf this week - said he hoped to encourage more investors from the Gulf
with a new electronic visa waiver system for short-term visitors from 
Oman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait.

He argued that the economic rise of countries such as China, India and Brazil should not be seen as a threat to the West, but as an opportunity for Britain to carve out a place alongside them in a more prosperous world.

‘As the number of university places surges in India, as China creates more patents than any other country in the world, and as Brazil becomes the world's first sustainable biofuels economy, people ask the question, will they be the winners and we be the losers? I believe we need to say a very firm “no”,’ he said.

‘The global economy is not a zero-sum game. If we make the wrong decisions, they may well succeed at our expense but there is a clear way forward for us to carve out a place for Britain to be a real success, alongside these new economic powers.’
