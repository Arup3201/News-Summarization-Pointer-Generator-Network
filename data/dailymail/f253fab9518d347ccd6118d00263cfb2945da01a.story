Most people feast on dishes brimming with turkey, potatoes and vegetables on Christmas Day.

But this shocking photo shows what one 83-year-old care home resident was served instead.

The pensioner was handed a plate containing a slice of bologna sausage, a piece of salami, some 'watered down' macaroni and a bread bun by staff at Pioneer Village in Saskatchewan, Canada.

For dessert, he was given simply a bowl of 'runny' apple sauce. 

'Unacceptable': This dish, containing a slice of bologna, a piece of salami, some 'watered down' macaroni and a bread bun, was given to an 83-year-old man at a Canada-based care home on December 25

Shocked: The pensioner's horrified daughter, Darlene Mitchell (pictured, left, and, right, with her elderly mom), posted a photo of the meal on Facebook after visiting the publicly-run Regina facility with her partner, Shauna

His horrified daughter, Darlene Mitchell, posted a photo of the meal on Facebook after visiting the publicly-run Regina nursing home with her partner, Shauna, deeming the offering 'unacceptable'.

Alongside the image, she wrote: 'So I wasn't going to do this on Christmas but I am doing this on Christmas. Tonight Shauna and I went to visit my dad in his care home.

'This is the meal they served the residence for Christmas supper. In case you can't tell what it is...it is a slice of bologna, a slice of salami, a bun and some watery macaroni salad.

'For dessert watered down apple sauce. So as always my mind isn't just angry it is curious... like who is in charge of meal planning. Do they say ok December 25 supper...bologna and a bun?'

In response, the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region has stressed that Pioneer Village residents were served a hot traditional Christmas meal - including turkey and all the trimmings - earlier in the day.

The later meal was, therefore, supposed to be cold and light, a spokesman said.  

Spreading the word: Alongside the image, Ms Mitchell wrote: 'Tonight Shauna and I went to visit my dad in his care home. This is the meal they served the residence for Christmas supper'. She then described the meal

However, the photo, which also features a glass of still water and a small pack of butter, has sparked concern among thousands of social media users and politicians over Canada's care of the elderly.

One Reddit user claimed her father - who resides at a different care facility - had simply been served canned meat for his Christmas dinner, while another said their relative was also served bologna.

Meanwhile, others  raised concerns over the nutritional value of meals in the country's care homes.

Speaking of the 'lack' of nutrition in her father's Christmas dinner, Ms Mitchell told CTV Regina: '(It) does not meet any nutritional guide whatsoever, especially on Christmas Day, but any day.'

Giving their opinion: One Reddit user said: 'It's the overall nutritional quality that's the issue' at Pioneer Village

In agreement: Another claimed her father - who resides at a different care facility - had been served canned meat for his Christmas dinner, saying: 'The same situation has been my Dad's existence for three years'

She added: 'It's dismal, it's depressing, it's sad and it's horrible that [this is how] these people are living the last years of their life. So what would I like changed? A hot meal.'

The provincial NDP agreed that Ms Mitchell's father's meal fell short of acceptable standards for seniors' care - and has called for minimum-care standards in seniors facilities across the province.

'The meal that was served on Christmas Day is absolutely unacceptable,' said Opposition Deputy Leader Trent Wotherspoon, claiming it would not be appropriate on any day of the year. 

'It doesn’t provide the basic nutrition. It doesn’t provide the dignity that those in care - that the seniors of this province, the builders of this province - deserve.'

Speaking out: Michael Redenbach (pictured), vice-president of integrated health services with the health region, spoke out in defense of the photo, saying: 'We make sure the nutritional needs of residents are met'

However, Michael Redenbach, vice-president of integrated health services with the health region, told CBC News: 'We make sure the nutritional needs of our residents are met.' 

He added that the health region works with registered dietitians to develop nutritious meal plans for residents. These are based on the provincial government's special-care home guidelines, he said.

Pioneer Village is the largest seniors' care home in Saskatchewan, with 390 beds.
