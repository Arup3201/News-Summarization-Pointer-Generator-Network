Tick tock, tick tock.

The clock is ticking for a Melbourne thief who brazenly stole a $22,000 Rolex Cosmograph Daytona from a heavily pregnant couple and fled  after threatening them with a screwdriver.

The unnamed couple, who live in the Victorian suburb of Balwyn, placed the advert for the watch on online classifieds site Gumtree hoping its sale would help go towards baby costs.

The expensive Rolex has a unique chocolate brown Arabic dial, ceramic black bezel strap and an 18 carat Everose gold folding buckle. 

A potential buyer, who calls himself 'Johnny', contacted the couple saying he was interested and the vendor and his six-months-pregnant wife arranged to meet at Cafe Max in the Doncaster Westfield.

After discussing the price and asking to try it on 'Johnny', who was still wearing the watch, fled.

The seller chased the thief but was forced to back off when the criminal pulled  a weapon out from his pocket, believed to be a screwdriver, and threatened him.

Police say the couple, who are expecting their second child, are 'upset' and urge people selling expensive goods to be cautious and suggest selling expensive items 'via other means.'

Detective Senior Constable Leanne Trusler told the ABC: 'It doesn't happen all the time, but it's an example of the dangers of selling online.

'I'd make some follow-up calls to make sure you're meeting someone who they say they are. 

'But selling a piece of jewellery or a watch at that price, I'd be doing it via other means.'

The unshaven thief, who was caught on CCTV, is described as being 20 to 30 years, athletically-built and about 180 centimetres tall. 

He was clad in a black baseball cap, a blue hoodie with white lines down the front, tracksuit pants with two stripes down the side and runners,

Anyone with information is urged to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or submit a confidential crime report.
