My husband Alex and I almost split up before we’d even moved in together. But it wasn’t over an affair or doubts about the relationship. It was over something far more serious — clutter.

More specifically, it was a garden gnome that almost did for us. That and a lamp made of a crab suspended in plastic. I know what you’re thinking, and you’re right; these are undeniably weird objects, which is why I had shoved them into a box marked ‘charity shop’ and told Alex they had to go. Pronto.

Cue a blistering row; the first skirmish in a war that began when we moved in together almost 13 years ago and continues to this day, even at the ripe old ages of 45 (me) and 47 (him).

Christina Hopkinson and her husband, Alex, almost split up before they'd even moved in together because they couldn't agree on which possessions they should be keeping

I thought we were the only ones, but a recent survey found that couples have an average of 32 rows over clutter in their first year of cohabitation. Apparently, London couples, like us, squeezed together in flats the size of bath tubs, argue about it once a week.

The survey estimated we throw out stuff worth £240 in that first year, which adds up to quite a few tasteless table lamps and freaky garden gnomes. Though I’d have been thrilled if it had only been £240 worth.

By the time we’d got rid of his vast orange armchairs that looked like they had been lifted from the Starship Enterprise, and my grandmother’s old sewing machine, our haul surely added up to a lot more.

The problem was, on deciding to live together, I wanted us to start with a clean slate — preferably one of those posh ones you serve cheese on — while Alex, ironically a divorce lawyer, wanted all his old stuff to come with him.

Christina (pictured) says that 13 years later they still can't find a happy medium when it comes to the storage situation in their home

These were the remnants of his former life, he said, and precisely the things that make a house a home.

But there are limits, and mine don’t stretch very far. It was when I suggested he bin the commemorative bottle of Theakston Old Peculier ale, given to him in 1988 for his 21st, that he finally snapped. We’d lived together for a week.

‘You’re trying to erase my past,’ he wailed as I eyed up his collection of 40 identical plain-white work shirts. One shirt is necessary, two offers choice — but 40? Really!

‘But all of this stuff has sentimental value,’ he protested. ‘Just as much as that box of diaries and letters you insist on keeping.’

I pointed threateningly to an ornamental silver banana. ‘Yes,’ he said, ‘even that.’ The banana an ex-girlfriend had bought for him for Christmas 20 years ago still sits smugly on our kitchen windowsill.

It was their constant arguing that prompted Christina to write the book The Pile Of Stuff At The Bottom Of The Stairs in 2011

‘Fine,’ I yelled, ‘I’ll burn my old diaries and letters if you just get rid of those cowboy boots you never, ever wear.’

Actually, we were both suffering delusions of grandeur — he that his objects were valuable family heirlooms, me that my memoirs and letters would one day be pored over by historians.

Not that I was innocent of other clutter, either. Alex pointed to my collection of uneaten vitamins and half-used face serums; to the unused kettle bell and weights; to the fitness DVDs still in cellophane — all hoarded more in hope than expectation.

The things we refused to part with represented the gulf between our dreams and reality. Alex had the roller blades and the tent for Glastonbury because he yearned for his carefree youth. I had the self-help videos and the size 8 dress because I yearned for a better me.

It was this mess that inspired me to write my novel The Pile Of Stuff At The Bottom Of The Stairs a few years ago, about a woman driven to the brink of divorce by the rising tide of untidiness at home.

I thought it was exaggerated, but this survey by the Big Yellow self storage company — who have a vested interest in resolving marital arguments about clutter, but I still believe their findings — suggests my novel nailed the problem.

They found that men typically stockpile gadgets and sports toys, while women hoard the stuff invested with emotions: cards from friends, cuddly toys from former lovers, and in my case the self-improving kit that promised to deliver a shiny new life.

Psychologists suggest we import this stuff into shared space in ways akin to animals marking territory — but using Beatrix Potter figurines and surf boards instead of urine.

For men of a certain age, I’d also mention the phenomenon which is vinyl record hoarding.Alex is immune, but every time I walk into a friend’s house, I hear the same complaint about the endless shelves of Jam and Clash and Bowie records that are central to their partner’s sense of self. And yet no record player ever exists in these houses.

Christina, picturd here with her three children, William, 7, Celia, 5 and Lydia, 3. She says 'children are the kings of clutter' with stuff toys and overflowing wardrobes constantly an issue

Every couple has a hoarder and an exorcist. Another friend says his wife feels it’s her life’s work to throw things out, occasionally when the object is still in his hand. But in my experience, the hoarder is generally the nicer half — the more tolerant and generous partner.

Certainly that’s the case with us. Alex believes gifts are for keeping because you like the giver, while I have no qualms about re-gifting or donating to the school tombola.

And if you think that first year together is bad, just wait for the arrival of babies. The crisis grows exponentially, like that enormous garbage patch of plastic flotsam that’s said to be bobbing about in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.

Children are the kings of clutter. Our three have enough animals to open a stuffed-toy zoo, and a habit of growing out of clothes — some of them cute, steeped in memories and very difficult to throw away.

Christina now has a huge underground cupboard where they keep all the excess clutter in their home

I thought I’d cracked it when we moved from that first home into one with more storage.

Now we have a huge underground cupboard, like a mini-cellar — the perfect graveyard for half-used tins of paint and sweaty sleeping bags.

But there’s something about January that reignites the clutter argument. Over Christmas we binge on eating and buying — we stuff stomachs and houses — and come the New Year I always find myself wanting to cut the fat accumulated on both.

It’s no coincidence that the languages of decluttering our homes and detoxing our bodies are so similar. We talk about purity, purging and cleaning in both cases.

I want to be someone who can wear white dresses and have white sofas. I want to be Gwyneth Paltrow. Is Gwynnie’s mantelpiece covered in plastic tat from Christmas crackers? I don’t think so.

The trouble is that my attempts to become a physical and domestic goddess somehow always end up with more clutter than before.

I ask my husband to clear out the cupboards and then find myself filling them again with things that I’m convinced will lead us to a more organised and clutter-free life.

I once bought one of those baskets that fits onto your stairs, with the aim of using it to tidy away the kids’ stuff that migrates downstairs every day. Instead, it sits unused at the bottom, waiting for someone to trip over it.

I have an ever-expanding collection of lidless Tupperware boxes. I also own vacuum bags for storing unused clothes that have never been filled.

Alex would be quite right if he pointed out that I am the one bringing all the clutter into the house.

He’d be right, but he wouldn’t be well-advised to say it. I might just retaliate and chuck out those cowboy boots.
