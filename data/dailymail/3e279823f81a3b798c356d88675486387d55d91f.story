Fox News host Shepard ‘Shep’ Smith has been forced to apologize after calling Robin Williams ‘such a coward’ just hours after he committed suicide.

During a report on Monday night about the actor’s legacy, Smith described his death as ‘cowardly’, citing a quote from Williams in which the actor described his children as an inspiration.

‘One of the children he so loved, one of the children grieving tonight because their father killed himself in a fit of depression,’ Smith said.

‘You could love three little things so much, watch them grow, they’re in their mid-20s, and they’re inspiring you, and exciting you, and they fill you up with the kind of joy you could never have known.’

‘And yet, something inside you is so horrible or you’re such a coward or whatever the reason that you decide that you have to end it. Robin Williams, at 63, did that today.’

The Fox news anchor then claimed the actor ‘probably had more fun most people I've ever known’ before moving on to talk to a guest about recreational drugs.

Smith's comments sparked much negative reaction on social media with many people accusing him of being insensitive and lacking sympathy towards the actor who had been battling depression.

Last time together: On July 21, in what could be the last picture of the comedy giant, Robin Williams posted this photograph to Instagram on his birthday of himself and his Night at the Museum co-star, Crystal the monkey. It was also the last time he was together with all his children

Smith later issued an apology for his poor choice of words,

‘I would never presume to know anything about his private life. And if any of his family members and friends were to have seen me use the word “coward,” I would be horrified.

'I would just like to apologize to the end of the earth to anyone who might think that I meant to openly call him a coward,’ he told Mediaite.

‘To the core of my being, I regret it. It just came out of my mouth. And I’m so sorry. And to anyone and their families who see that, I am sorry.’

Smith wasn't the first person to be critical of William's actions. Diff'rent Strokes star Todd Bridges took to Twitter to criticize Williams just minutes after his death was reported on Monday.

The 49-year-old TV veteran quickly deleted the posting, which called Williams' untimely passing 'a very selfish act', before issuing a series of apologies.

Bridges wrote on the microblogging site a
 contrite missive: 'I apologize for my negative comment, and I ask 
forgiveness for any pain that I have caused anyone.'

But it was just hours before when he tweeted upon hearing the news of the legendary comic's passing: 'You don't think that my life has been hell and I've had so many ups and downs now.

'If I did that what am i showing my children that when it gets tough that's the way out No you gotta buckle down ask God to help you. That's when prayer really comes into effect.'

Adding: 'Rest in peace Robin Williams I hope you found what you were looking for.'

The tweet was promptly deleted with an explanatory note, attempting to shed light on why he had posted the angry missive to begin with.

'I would like to apologize for the terrible timing of me comments that I made in reference to the untimely death of Robin Williams,' Bridges wrote. 'My best friend committed suicide a few months ago, and I was devastated to discover that he did not solicit my help.

'I am sure that my attitude toward Williams's death was a delayed reaction of my best friend's death.'
