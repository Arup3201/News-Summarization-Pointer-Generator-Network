A brave woman has decided to swap candy for trick-or-treaters this Halloween in favor of an uninvited letter about childhood obesity.

Children who appear overweight or 'moderately obese' to a woman, who was only willing to give her first name Cheryl, will be handed this helpful note instead of the usual sugary stash on Thursday in Fargo Moorhead, North Dakota.

The woman even called a local radio station on Tuesday to spread her message that it is irresponsible to allow overweight children to join in the holiday fun.

Unsurprisingly, many parents have posted their outrage online about the woman's plan to give letters to 'moderately obese' children on Halloween (stock image)

The letter, which has gone viral across the Internet, reads: 'You [sic] child is, in my opinion, moderately obese and should not be consuming sugar and treats to the extent of some children this Halloween season.

'My hope is that you will step up as a parent and ration candy this Halloween and not allow your child to continue these unhealthy eating habits.'

Cheryl told radio station WRIG: 'I just want to send a message to the parents of kids that are really overweight…

'I think it’s just really irresponsible of parents to send them out looking for free candy just cause all the other kids are doing it.'

Cheryl's crusade comes from the belief that it falls to the whole community to prevent childhood obesity.

The printed letter, with a festive pumpkin graphic in the corner, is now doing the rounds on social media where many parents have not taken too kindly to being told how to raise their children.

On one blog where the letter appeared, one post from sharp_stick read: 'I hope she enjoys cleaning egg and toilet paper off every surface of her property. 
Just shut the lights off if you're going to be an a****** on Halloween.'

Another succinctly posted: 'dear madame, my child's weight is none of your f****** business.'
