For little Jacob Madgin simple tasks like preparing food, taking a bath or passing a dog in the street can leave him literally scared stiff.

The four-year-old's entire body will become rigid if he is shocked, causing him to suffer seizures and spasms.

Jacob, from Wallsend in North Tyneside has the rare condition hyperekplexia, also known as 'startle disease'.  

The inherited condition, which is thought to affect only 70 families worldwide, can cause Jacob to stop breathing and choke.

Lesley Madgin, 48, has to watch four year old son Jacob constantly as  he could choke or stop breathing due to 'startle disease', which causes his body to become rigid when he becomes shocked

Everyday occurrences like taking a bath, preparing food or seeing a dog in the street can trigger the condition, making it impossible to know when Jacob could have a serious episode

Jacob is unable to alert others to what is happening, as the condition leaves him unable to cough or shout as his throat goes into spasm.

His mother Lesley Madgin, 48, said everyday occurrences like taking a bath, preparing food or passing a dog on the street can cause Jacob to spasm and seize up.

She said: ‘You never know what might trigger Jacob’s condition. When I was opening a box of blueberries the noise of the plastic as I opened the lid set him off.

‘In the past it used to be animals as he could not go passed a dog without going into spasm, but now he’s fine with dogs. 

'Another time he asked to have a ride on a pony but as he approached the pony his whole body went stiff.'

Anything can set off Jacob’s condition and the unpredictably of the illness makes it almost impossible to know when he will have a serious episode. 

Hyperkplexia - also known as startle disease - is a rare neurological disorder which causes sufferers to react in an exaggerated way when startled.

They become rigid and unable to move, and sometimes stop breathing, which can prove fatal. 

The main symptoms of the condition include stiffness that can prevent the person from moving. 

It can cause them to fall, stiffly, like a log, without loss of consciousness.

When a baby startles, it may be accompanied by non-epileptic seizures with increased stiffness and twitching. 

Simple activities, such as having a bath, can trigger the condition.

There is no cure for the illness but medication can help to ease the symptoms.

Mrs Madgin, a teaching assistant, said the condition means she worries about her son constantly. 

She said: ‘I’d love to wrap him up in cotton wool but I try to treat him as I would any child, although it’s difficult to cut the apron ties as I worry about him all the time.’

Jacob was born naturally five days early, weighing a healthy 7lb 10lbs. 

But within 32 hours Mrs Madgkin and her husband Allan, 56, a nursing assistant, knew something was wrong with their son noticing he was ‘twitchy and upset'.

Jacob had to be fed through a tube because every time the family tried breast or bottle feeding he would spasm as his nose touched a teat.

It was not until he was eight-months-old that experts made an official diagnoses, following a number of tests and examinations.

Now the family try to avoid anything that might scare Jacob - even water being splashed on him.

Mrs Madgin has to watch her son constantly so he doesn’t choke, and worries that as a child he is oblivious to the danger presented by his seizures and spasms.

She said: ‘When Jacob was initially diagnosed I felt OK about it because we were told that the most difficult time would be the first year of his life and I felt it could be worse.

‘But it’s a very difficult condition to manage and I have to watch him all the time as he can choke on anything.

‘It is sad that he has this hereditary condition and I do worry that he will get teased as he gets older. 

'We just have to take it one day at a time, but Jacob has not got an awareness of danger and that makes it even worse.’

Despite his rare condition, parents say Jacob Madgin is a 'quick, bright and intelligent' boy who has a great sense of humour and is loved by everyone

Although there is no cure for the illness,  Jacob takes medication to relax his muscles

Tomorrow Jacob will start his first day at school in Wallsend, North Tyneside, and he will get one-to-one support to make sure he’s safe and well. 

Mrs Madgin said: ‘Jacob has a brilliant sense of humour and he’s a fantastic, funny boy that everybody loves. 

'He attracts people wherever he goes and he’s always smiling. He is a very quick, bright and intelligent boy.’

Both Mr and Mrs Madgin carry the faulty gene that causes hyperekplexia, but fortunately their eldest son, Josh, seven, did not inherit the illness.

Jacob is monitored by consultants at the Great North Children’s Hospital, based at Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary, and takes medication to relax his muscles.

Children’s charity Action Medical Research has funded studies looking at the genes that cause the condition and Mrs Madgin is keen to raise awareness to the rare disease.

Dr Caroline Johnston, research evaluation manager at Action Medical Research said: ‘Although the symptoms of startle disease often fade by the time babies reach their first birthday, they can continue throughout childhood and into adulthood, with some children experiencing severe breathing problems and others having learning difficulties.'

'Startle disease' is so rare that it is thought to affect just 70 families worldwide. Charity Action Medical Research is looking into the genes which cause the condition

She added that further research could lead to a new genetic test to identify babies with ‘startle disease’.

She said: ‘Action has funded research looking at the genes which cause startle disease in the hope of giving more babies access to a full diagnosis.

‘The research could lead to a new genetic test for babies and children. If diagnosed correctly, babies can be treated with drugs that help reduce the unwanted startle reaction and also reduce muscle stiffness.’
