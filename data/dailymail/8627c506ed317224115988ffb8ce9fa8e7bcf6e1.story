A grieving widow has been arrested after letting her husband's death go unreported for months in the hopes she could fulfill his bizarre last request to be eaten by birds.

Ila Solomon, 55, of Lafayette, Ariz., was charged Thursday with welfare fraud, theft, failure to report a dead body, failure to file a death certificate, and unlawful disposition of a dead human body.

Authorities claim she was even illegally cashing her dead spouse Gerald Gavan's social security and pension checks.

ABC 15 reports that Gavan's body was discovered on the living room floor nine months after his death.

Solomon claimed the 88-year-old died on April 28th after suffering a stroke but forensic evidence showed Gavan had been dead since at least July 2013. 

Solomon previously told reporters that Gavan wanted his body consumed by vultures as part of a ritual in India.

'I just think that somebody who did so much for the United States should have the death he wanted, that's all,' she told ABC 15. 'He just wanted to be eaten by the birds to be part of the cycle of life.

'Plan number two would be for me to take him outside or him to die outside so that the birds could eat him here, but that didn't happen, instead he died right here,' she said.

Police first went looking for Gavan in May but Solomon told the officers that he'd gone to the Kentucky Derby with her sister and brother-in-law.

She also told cops that he'd had a stroke and was being cared for in an assisted living facility.

That claim made the officers suspicious and they entered the home only to spot his decomposing body hidden beneath some bed covers an in an advanced state of decay.

The union was Solomon's third marriage.

Solomon claimed to have returned some of the federal benefit money, but it seemed too little too late. 

She has declined to comment on the charges.

Gavan's cause of death remains undetermined.
