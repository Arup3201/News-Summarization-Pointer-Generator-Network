An old Cornish coast toilet block with a stunning sea view is set for a new life as a romantic holiday home after being sold for £115,000 to a former glamour model.

The ladies and gents public loos in Charlestown – the historic harbour location where BBC blockbuster Sunday drama Poldark was filmed – smashed the auction guide price of between £75,000 and £95,000.

The sale to former model and property developer Charlotte Thomson comes after property experts predicted a boom in interest in Cornish property this year as the historical drama showcases the county’s beauty.

Miss Thomson, who appeared in magazines like FHM and was also a finalist in Miss England, owns romantic holiday home firm Lovers Retreats.

Auctioneer Graham Barton said the final selling price of the 502 sq ft block and grounds overlooking St Austell Bay had been ‘a breathtaking outcome’.

He said: ‘It was a spectacular lot, I haven't seen something with so much potential in as long as I can remember.

‘This is arguably the most gloriously located residential development opportunity for sale in Cornwall today.

‘It has stunning panoramic and jaw dropping sea views. The property looks southwards across St Austell Bay with the historic harbour at its western edge.

‘There is huge potential for a fantastic family home or holiday home with extension or complete replacement among the options subject to planning consent.’

The lot included land to the front and opposite the block, with possible permission to extend.

Christopher Bailey, of Knight Frank estate agents in Exeter, had told the Daily Mail earlier this month: ‘Just like Doc Martin before it, Poldark will give viewers a reminder of how beautiful Cornwall is. We are looking forward to a busy summer.’

Miss Thomson bought the property with her partner at the auction by Clive Emson which took place at the St Mellion International Resort near Saltash.

However, some have expressed concerns about the block being sold for residential development and the loss of toilet facilities in the popular St Austell Bay beauty spot.

One local resident said: ‘I can see why they are being sold off as they have a fantastic view but you do need public toilets.

‘I hope they build new ones somewhere else nearby.’
