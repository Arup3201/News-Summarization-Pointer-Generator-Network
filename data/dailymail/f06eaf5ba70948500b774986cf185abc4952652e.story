Kimberly Bradbury, 24, of Ilkeston, Derbyshire, died in hospital after falling ill following a river cruise and a trip to a nightclub with friends

Police were today investigating whether a 24-year-old mental health worker who collapsed and died following a night out is the latest victim of an ecstasy-style drug called 'Dr Death', which is thought to have claimed at least 11 lives so far in the UK.

Kimberley Bradbury fell ill following an 'all-you-can-drink' river cruise and a trip to a nightclub with friends.

The group later headed to a house in the her home town of Ilkeston, Derbyshire - where it is believed she began convulsing.

Kimberly was rushed to hospital in Nottingham but pronounced dead later.

A 27-year-old man has now been arrested on suspicion of supplying class A drugs in connection with Kimberly’s death.

A post-mortem examination is due to be carried out today.

But investigators will focus on whether Kimberly had taken PMA, a party drug already linked to the deaths of two young people in Derbyshire in recent months and as many as nine others across the country.

The drug - nicknamed 'Dr Death' or 'pink ecstasy' - is sold to revellers for as little as £3 a pill, and can be up to five times as strong as standard ecstasy.

A spokesman for Derbyshire Police said inquiries were continuing.

He added: 'We want to speak to people who saw her before her death to find out what has happened.'

Before collapsing in the early hours of Saturday, Kimberly had sailed down the river Trent in Nottingham on a cruise organised by a local company.

Kimberly and her friends paid £34 for an all-inclusive barbeque and drinks package on the boat, and entry to a nightclub in Nottingham.

But a spokesman for East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) said it received a call at 5.02am on Saturday saying a woman had collapsed after taking drugs.

Kimberly arrived at Nottingham’s Queens Medical Centre at 5.51am, but doctors were unable to save her.

Killer: PMA, known as 'Dr Death', has been linked to a number of deaths of young people in recent months

Last month, 16-year-old Ellie Jones was feared to have become the youngest victim of PMA after she collapsed and died at a house party in Warrington

Emotional tributes have been paid to Kimberley on Facebook.

The drug is often shaped like a Love Heart, and is known as 'Dr Death, 'Pink Ecstasy', 'Mitsubishi Turbos' or 'Pink McDonalds', although its scientific name is para-Methoxyamphetamine.

The pills are the same size and shape as an ecstasy tablet, are usually pink or white and often have the letter 'M' printed on them.

It is sold to clubbers for as little as £3 a pill - dealers claim it offers a similar high to ecstasy, but it is five times as strong and can cause the body temperature to rise dangerously.

In addition, because it takes effect relatively slowly, revellers sometimes take multiple pills to speed up its effect.

As little as a quarter of a tablet is enough to significantly increase blood pressure, body temperature and pulse rates.

It causes paranoia and depression in people who use the drug a lot.

When mixing PMA with alcohol its effects are increased, making it more likely for users to experience its negative effects.

PMA is a class A drug, meaning it is illegal to carry it for personal use, give away or sell.

One
friend wrote: 'She looks beautiful and that’s how Kimbo will always be 
remembered! Thank you for some amazing memories from school right up 
until our adult life.'

Kimberly, whose parents are separated, lived with mum Alison.

Her family, and boyfriend Craig Newton, 23, were too upset to comment.

But a neighbour on the street said: 'She was a lovely girl, who was very popular and enjoyed life. It is a complete tragedy.'

The deaths last December in Derbyshire of student Charlotte Woodiwiss, 20, and 18-year-old Dale Yates were linked to PMA.

In April, Rachel Clayton, 34, and her partner Emma Speed, 30, were found at their home at Macclesfield after it is thought they took the drug.

And last month, 16-year-old Ellie Jones was feared to have become the youngest victim of PMA after she collapsed and died at a house party in Warrington.

The pills - often shaped like Love Hearts sweets and stamped with a McDonald’s-style M - are made from a different amphetamine from that used in ecstasy.

And they take longer to take effect - meaning revellers often take several and unwittingly give themselves a fatal overdose.

Deaths in Canada, Norway and Denmark have also been linked to the drug.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
