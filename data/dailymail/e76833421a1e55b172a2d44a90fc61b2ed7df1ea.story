Joan Rivers has refused to apologize to the three women who were held captive in a basement for nearly a decade after joking at their expense - and has hurled even more insults at them.

The comedienne caused outrage on Wednesday when she compared her daughter's guest room with the captivity the women experienced at the home of Ariel Castro.

'Those women in the basement in Cleveland had more space,' she quipped on the Today show.

And later, after the women's lawyers branded her comments hurtful, Rivers said the women really shouldn't be complaining.

Poor taste: Joan Rivers, pictured with her daughter on the Today show, sparked outrage when she made a joke at the expense of the Cleveland kidnap victims - but she has refused to apologize

'They got to live rent free for more than a decade,' she defiantly told TMZ.

'One
 of them has a book deal. Neither are in a psych ward. They're ok. I bet
 you within three years one of them will be on Dancing with the Stars.'

The 80-year-old sharp-tongued television host brushed off her joke as she spoke to a local paper in Cleveland.

There is nothing to apologize for,' she told the Cleveland Plain Dealer. 'I know what those girls went through. It was a little stupid joke. There is nothing to apologize for.

House of horrors: Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight were held captive at this Cleveland home

'I made a joke. That's what I do. Calm down. Calm f***ing down. I'm a comedienne. They're free, so letâ€™s move on.'

A
 Wednesday statement from attorneys for Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus 
had called Rivers' earlier remark about their captivity hurtful and 
shocking.

The attorneys say the women have endured painful media attention and the comment is 'a new low' that warrants an apology.

On Thursday, Today show host Willie Geist - who had gasped alongside his fellow hosts when Rivers made the quip earlier in the week - said they did not condone what she had said.

'We regret her comment was made on our air - deeply and truly,' he said. 'I hope our reactions in real time show that way we felt about her attempted joke... We obviously didn't find it funny and we didn't approve of it.'

Cleveland Captives

Rivers' publicist hasn't responded to messages seeking comment.

Amanda
 Berry, 27, Gina DeJesus, 24, 
and Michelle Knight, 33, were held captive at Castro's Cleveland home 
after being kidnapped from the streets of Cleveland between 2002 and 
2004.

Knight, Amanda Berry and DeJesus escaped when Berry pushed out a door and yelled for help.

She
 told a police dispatcher in a dramatic 911 call: 'Help me. I'm Amanda 
Berry. I've been kidnapped, and I've been missing for 10 years, and I'm,
 I'm here, I'm free now.'

Castro pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life in prison. He hanged himself on September 3, just weeks into his sentence.

The women were household names in Cleveland for years as missing persons, and 
their discovery electrified a community accustomed to bleaker outcomes.
