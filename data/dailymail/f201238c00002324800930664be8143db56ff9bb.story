Pilots were forced to show off their skills yesterday as stormy weather hit the north of England. 

And as this incredible video shows, planes flying into Manchester battled against the winds that saw many appear to be 'hovering' on their descent in. 

Posted on Twitter by user@philip2004, the action was taken from near the airport pub close to the runway.

As well as tilting from side to side, the plane appears to be 'hovering' as it gets trapped by the wind

Speaking to MailOnline Travel, @philip2004 from Stockport, said 'I'd say the wind was gusting at about 35 miles per hour.

'I never fear the aircraft landing but it did look nice and they will land ok.

'I really need to get filming where I can barely stand up myself.'The only thing is predicting when there's a long enough day of winds.

'The planes were swaying in the wind but it wasn't as big a deal as other days I've seen. I was here for the Emirates one last week when they had to abort the landing.' 

The wind was thought to only be around 35mph, but the direction and pressure affected the landing

Rob Hunter, British Airline Plot's Association (BALPA) head of flight safety told MailOnline Travel that pilots are well-trained to deal with a crosswind landing.

'The pilots here are performing a cross-wind landing which we train for all the time, and which are not that unusual,' said Mr Hunter. 

'The wind is trying to push the aircraft one way, so the pilot has to point the aircraft into the wind until the last minute at which point he or she then turns the aircraft to be head on with the runway. 

'This is just one example of the need for well-trained, well-rested professional pilots.'

Mr Dodd told MailOnline that he was always confident the plane would make a safe landing

 As well as capturing the windy landing for an Etihad 777, he also videoed British Airways and easyJet planes having a less-than comfortable descent.

Last week he was on hand to catch a 'go around' of an Emirates A380 when it couldn't land due to high winds.

The plane that had flown in from Dubai came around a second time, and despite a few wobbly moments, made a safe landing. 

After getting over a period of crosswinds, the Etihad jet approached the runway effortlessly

It was by no means the most comfortable of landings, but all passengers were safe on board

The manoeuvre meant the passengers were only delayed by 25 minutes; a scheduled landing of 11.20am turned into 11.45am. 

One eyewitness told the Manchester Evening News: 'This is a huge plane which we see come over every day and it's quite unusual to see it do a go-around like it did.'

In January this year, planes were battered by 100mph winds when trying to land at Leeds Bradford International Airport.

One propeller plane - a Flybe flight - looks particularly precarious as it swings from side to side on the approach.

Pushed sideways onto the runway, the plane almost seems to land nose-first as it struggles against the gusts.

Leeds Bradford Airport is considered one of the most difficult airports to land at in the UK.

Its altitude sees it hit by strong winds in bad weather.

But these skilled pilots show how flights compensate for the high winds, by approaching at an extreme angle.

Footage emerged after a North Atlantic storm hit the UK, causing the strongest wind gusts in over 50 years.
