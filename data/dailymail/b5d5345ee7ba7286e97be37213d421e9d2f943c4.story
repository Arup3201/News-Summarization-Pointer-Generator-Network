The UK's first specialty cereal cafe has just opened its doors in London's Brick Lane and it's already causing quite the stir.

The Cereal Killer Cafe is the brainchild of identical twins, Alan and Gary Keely, from Belfast and boasts an impressive offering of the breakfast staple.

Along with 120 varieties of cereal, the restaurant - set up in the hipster epicentre of the captial -   also offers 20 toppings and 12 different milk options.

The restaurant is heavy on 90s nostalgia, as evidenced by the throwback decor and retro furniture

'We thought 'Why isn't there anywhere that you can just go and sit down and have a bowl of cereal?' Gary Keely explains in the video.

'So we went and did some research into it – would it work as a business? How would it look? Where would we get the cereal from? And everything was just ticking all the boxes for us.

So, here we are, nearly a year and a half later.'

Plenty of limited edition breakfast offerings line the shelves, like these royal varieties

Research into opening such an establishment began nearly a year and a half ago

The establishment is heavy on the nostalgia, with limited-edition boxes and collectibles proudly displayed on furniture reminiscent of yesteryear.

The eighties and nineties vibe continues with the music choices and vintage magazines.

'We just want people to walk in and think: 'God, do you remember this?' and just to feel like a kid again,' he adds.

'We want people to walk in and think: "God, do you remember this?'' Gary says of the cafe's nostalgic vibe

When asked to point out his favourites, Gary migrated towards popping candy-infused Poppin' Pebbles

'We just wanted to play on the nostalgia, so we've got a lot of vintage cereal boxes. 

'We've got a lot of the toys that you used to get. 

'The music that we're playing is a lot of 80s and 90s music. 

'The magazines are all 80s and 90s.'

'We've got a lot of vintage cereal boxes and a lot of the toys that you used to get,' he adds

Aside from the 120 varieties of cereal, there are also 20 toppings to choose from and 12 different types of milk

The cafe is open from 7am until 10pm and serves breakfast, lunch and dinner - meaning cereal aficionados can get their fix pretty much anytime of day.

Behind the counter, brightly-coloured boxes line the walls and offerings are as diverse as Golden Grahams and Reese's Puffs to Cap'n Crunch and Apple Jacks.  

'There's so many weird ones, like, a lot of these ones are from America,' the co-owner says.

Get your fix at any time! The cafe is open from 7am until 10pm and serves breakfast, lunch and dinner

Gary is also a fan of the limited-edition Halloween cereals that line the shelves, such as Count Chocula

'We've got Poppin' Pebbles, which is berry-flavoured cereal with pieces of popping candy in it, which is really strange. It's got that little pop, but it's still quite nice.

'I really love the Boo-berry, Count Chocula and Franken-berry – these are limited-edition Halloween cereals that are only available one month of the year in America. 

'We've got these, but really limited-edition, so we've only got about 20 boxes of them.'

Employee Jules Prentice explains the cereal 'cocktail' idea: mixing several varieties to create a custom bowl

He demonstrates by creating one of the restaurant's signature concoctions: Choco-potamus

And it's affordable! Small bowls will cost £2.50, while large bowls are priced at just £3.50

A male employee, Jules Prentice, offers a tour of the 'mixology' station, where customers can create a custom 'cocktail' of several types of cereal mixed together.

'Just to mix things up a little bit, Alan and Gary have created a range of cocktails, just taking different cereals and combining them together,' the cereal mixologist adds.

'I think a lot of kids when they're younger used to do that themselves, so they basically designed a whole range of cocktails including the toppings that we have, as well.'

The staff then demonstrated their skills by creating the restaurant's signature Choco-potamus concoction.

Small bowls of cereal will cost £2.50, medium bowls will set customers back £3.00 and large bowls are priced at £3.50.
