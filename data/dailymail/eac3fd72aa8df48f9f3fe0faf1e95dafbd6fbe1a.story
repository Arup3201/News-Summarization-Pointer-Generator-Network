David Dimbleby has said he is too old to become the BBC’s next director general after a lively appearance on the radio led to speculation that he was putting himself forward.

The Question Time presenter, 74, took to the airwaves yesterday to attack the corporation’s ‘bonkers’ bloated management system and its culture of ‘gobbledegook’.

However, he also defended the 
corporation’s ‘dedicated and hard-working’ rank and file staff during 
his appearance on Radio 4’s flagship news show Today.

Furious: Veteran David Dimbleby has launched a bitter attack on the BBC and said it is 'over-managed' by people who can't speak plain English

His
decision to give an interview yesterday was interpreted by many as an 
attempt by the presenter, who has once before applied to be director 
general and twice before applied to be BBC chairman, to ‘throw his hat 
in the ring’ to replace George Entwistle.

But yesterday Mr Dimbleby told the Mail this was not the case.

He said he would not be allowed to run the BBC anyway because, at 74, he was above the age limit.

Asked
if his interview on Today was a thinly-veiled job application, he said:
‘It wasn’t. I’m over the age barrier, simple as that. I can’t do it 
because of my age. That’s the rules.’

Mr
Dimbleby described the BBC as the ‘greatest broadcasting organisation 
in the world’ but added: ‘What it has is a crisis of management of its 
own making.’

Attack: Mr Dimbleby said that George Entwistle lacked the 'stomach' needed for the job and Lord Patten should consider why he hired him in the first place

He said ‘committed’ staff who serve the public faithfully have been ‘betrayed by the management’.

The
TV presenter compared the bureaucracy of the BBC with that of the NHS, 
saying they both are guilty of ‘managers adding to management’ and 
reducing the actual service.

Mr
Dimbleby added: ‘In my opinion it is still over-managed and the 
management still speak gobbledegook.......It’s gone bonkers at that 
level.’

But said it was ‘hyperbole’  to describe the situation as the worst crisis in the BBC’s history.

Mr Dimbleby added he believed George 
Entwistle had been given a huge £450,000 pay-off to get rid of him and 
that BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten should 'reflect' on why he chose 
Entwistle in the first place.

The BBC's biggest-ever internal crisis is entirely 'of its own making', he said.

The
presenter, who has been with the BBC for 50 years, has applied for the 
director general job in the past and his outburst has led to speculation
he will take another run at it after Entwistle resigned after just 54 
days in charge.

He
pointed out that George Entwistle's previous title before his abortive 
stint as DG had been head of 'vision' rather than head of television.

The presenter said the existing culture did not produce 'good director-generals'.

'You
get people who have played the game very carefully, one against the 
other... they just don't have the stomach for what is needed,' he said.

Angry: John Simpson also blamed 'over-management' at the BBC that started thirty years ago

Dimbleby
said it would be 'absurd' for BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten to resign 
over the controversy.

But he added: 'I think he should reflect on why he
chose George.'

Writing in the Daily Telegraph, 
Dimbleby suggested the nature of Mr Entwistle's departure demonstrated 
that he was not right for the job.

'The
fact that he chose to resign rather than fight shows that he was not 
the right choice for Director-General.

The DG has to fight like a tiger 
to defend the BBC and George did not do that,' he added.

The trouble is that the BBC in recent years has throttled itself with its own bureaucracy - which saps the energy of its staff and demoralises them.

'It is over-managed and badly managed so that no-one knows how or where decisions are taken.

'The upshot is a crazy system where George as head of television, when told of the Savile suspicions, ends up saying that he does not want to show 'undue interest' in something that clearly radically affects his programming.'

Meanwhile veteran correspondent John Simpson says the BBC can salvage its damaged reputation but also blamed 'over-management' for some of its ills.

'It may look good if more senior people resign, but the only effect it will have will be to make the people who take their place more timid. If it happens, it will be a cop-out. What is required is a change in the way News and Current Affairs, and perhaps other parts of the BBC, are controlled,' he said.

'Over-management has been a serious blight on the BBC since the Eighties. The proliferation of middle managers in the BBC was something that Lord Patten wanted to deal with; but the decisions about who should be sacked were all too often made by middle managers.

In spite of everyone’s best intentions, the real weight of the savage cuts that have been imposed on the BBC since the licence-fee agreement of 2010 has fallen on the programme-makers and broadcasters.

'In the past Newsnight would never have thought of contracting out something as important as the investigation of a child-molestation scandal to an independent company; it would have been done in-house, by people who adhered to the BBC’s own standards.'
