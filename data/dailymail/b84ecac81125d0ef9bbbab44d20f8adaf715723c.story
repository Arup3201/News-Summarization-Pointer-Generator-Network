Roy Hodgson refused to join in the widespread praise of Ross Barkley despite the young Everton midfielder's sparkling performance in Miami.

Speaking to reporters after the 2-2 draw with Ecuador, Hodgson also said he would not address the 'obsession' to start the 20-year-old against Italy in Manaus.

Hodgson said: 'I thought Wayne Rooney played very, very well and I think Ross Barkley had some good moments. I think he needs to learn when he can 
turn with the ball and when he has to keep the ball.

'Obsession': Roy Hodgson would not be drawn on the question of Barkley's involvement in Manuas

'But that's quite 
normal for a player his age. He'll be quite happy to have played so long
 on his first start.'

Asked whether Barkley would be among the starters against Italy, Hodgson then added: 'There always seems to be an enormous obsession with one player.

'I will be prepared to start any of the players in any game, but I'm not prepared to address your obsession with Ross Barkley.

'If he's going to be the player we want him to be, he has to make better decisions of when he turns with the ball.

In front: Lambert lashed a powerful shot into the corner after a driving run by the Everton youngster

'That's not a criticism, but there were 
other performances out there today. Oxlade-Chamberlain and Phil Jones 
were outstanding, as was Jack Wilshere in the middle of the park, while 
Rickie Lambert scored a magnificent goal.'

In an entertaining game, England found themselves a goal down, then a goal in front before being pegged back by a Michael Arroyo thunderbolt that flew into the top corner.

Raheem Sterling and Antonio Valencia were both sent off after the Manchester United winger overreacted to a hard challenge from the young Liverpool flyer - Sterling got the ball but will now miss the final World Cup warm-up against Honduras on Saturday.

Worry: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was forced into an early exit after picking up a knee injury

'I thought it was a very good game,' Hodgson added. 'I was disappointed with the sendings off, and the potential injury to one of our players (Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who suffered possible ligament damage) - but as a friendly, a warm-up match for our players, it was good.

'They tested us but we dealt with them very well for long periods, and caused their defence many problems. We could have been several goals up before they scored their goal.

'If the players cope with things as well as these players on Saturday, we'll go to Brazil and Manaus very confident.'
