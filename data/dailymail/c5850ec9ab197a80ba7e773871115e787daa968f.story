The frost also prompted officials at Sandown Park racecourse in Surrey to hold a ground inspection after temperatures dipped below freezing overnight. 

However, conditions improved and the inspection was passed at 10.30 this morning.  

But it seems as though the cold and unsettled conditions are set to continue with a weather warning issued for large parts of Scotland, northern England and Northern Ireland for ice and wind heading into next week.

Forecasters also expect snowfall over higher ground in north west Scotland and in the Pennines tomorrow with those at lower levels being told to expect 'slushy deposits'.

The wintry conditions come a day after the first snowfall of the winter over Britain saw flurries on the northern mountain ranges of the Lake District and the Highlands of Scotland 

The cold blast will sweep in from northern Europe late on Sunday but Scotland's mountains, upland areas of northern England and the Welsh mountains will bear the brunt of the weather, which could last well into next week.

The Met Office warning said: 'The public should be aware of the potential for difficult driving conditions.' 

The warning comes after yesterday, Britain saw its first snowfall of the winter over the northern mountain ranges of the Lake District and in the Highlands of Scotland.

The snow descended upon the peaks of Helvellyn, Belncathra and Skiddaw, heralding the start of winter weeks after the first dustings usually appear.

The Met Office's weather warnings in place Sunday and Monday also warn of 'widespread icy patches' and the risk of ice on untreated surfaces following overnight rain.

Forecasters warned of travel disruption due to the adverse weather conditions and added: 'Accumulating snow may lead to travel disruption through the region.

'The public should be aware of the potential for disruption to travel on Sunday and into Monday morning.'

The wintry conditions have prompted several bookmakers to slash the odds on a White Christmas with Ladbrookes offering prices of 7/2 in Glasgow, 9/2 in Manchester and 5/1 in London.

But the Met Office said it was too early to predict if there would be snowfall on Christmas Day but said the outlook for the rest of December was for unsettled weather with a mixture of cold spells and showers.
