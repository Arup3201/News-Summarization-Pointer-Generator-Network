Arsenal's move for Winston Reid has hit a stumbling block over West Ham's asking price.

Arsene Wenger is keen to sign the New Zealand central defender this month as he looks to bolster his options at the back.

The Gunners were hopeful of landing Reid in a cut-price deal - in the region of £4million-£5m - due to the fact he has just six months left to run on his deal.

Arsenal have been dealt a blow with the news West Ham United want upwards of £8m for Winston Reid

However, West Ham will only consider offers upwards of £8million for the defender, a price the Gunners are not prepared to go to.

Arsenal are keen to get a deal in place to sign Reid this month, rather than wait until the summer when he is a free agent.

Tottenham are keen on Reid, but want to wait until the end of the season when he is available on a free transfer.

Tottenham have been monitoring Sevilla forward Carlos Bacca.

Aware that Harry Kane is carrying his team's goalscoring burden, manager Mauricio Pochettino is in the market for a new forward this month.

And Spurs representatives have been to Spain to watch the Colombia striker this season with a view to a move this month.

The 28-year-old has impressed for Sevilla, scoring 11 goals for the La Liga club this season.

Spurs are also plotting a loan move for Paris St Germain midfielder Adrien Rabiot.

Queens Park Rangers could revisit their interest in Ajax striker Kolbeinn Sigthorsson this month.

The Iceland international was a target for Harry Redknapp in the summer but the QPR boss couldn't finalise a deal.

But having missed out on Jermain Defoe, the Rangers chief is contemplating a renewed bid for the striker.

Rangers' spending this month is being heavily restricted as the club clamp down on big wages amid fears of Financial Fair Play punishment.

Crystal Palace plan to return with a renewed offer for Swansea left-back Neil Taylor.

Alan Pardew saw his £3.5m offer rebuffed by the Swans earlier this week.

But Palace, who are in the market for a left-back, are poised to return with an improved offer for Taylor.

Blackpool are close to signing Chelsea youngster Islam Feruz on loan until the end of the season.

Feruz was training with Cardiff but failed to reach an agreement with the Bluebirds.
