A 53-year-old pastor who reportedly impregnated 20 members of congregation claims the Holy Spirit ordered him to have sex with them.

Nigerian police have now arrested Timothy Ngwu for abusing the young girls and women at Vineyard Ministry of the Holy Trinity.

Ngwu's abusive behaviour was finally reported to the police by his estranged wife Veronica who grew tired of his adulterous behaviour - and reportedly impregnated her young neice.

A spokesperson for the Enugu State Police command told Naij.com he claims to be obeying the 'spiritual' urge to carry out the will of God, 'irrespective of whether the woman is married or not.'

Ebere Amaraizu added: 'When the woman is delivered of the baby, the child remains in the ministry with the mother for life.'

Ngwu told the same website he has 13 children with five different wives and the mistresses God's 'prophetic' will told him to acquire.

He also claims he never had sex with any married woman unless their husbands consented to the Holy Spirit's request. 

Calista Omeje and Assumpta Odo both left their husbands to live with the pastor based on these holy commands.

Mother-of-eight Odo said Ngwu impregnated both her and her daughter, whose age is not known.

And Calista - who has 10 children with her husband - said the pastor impregnated her but the baby died. She also revealed that she 'gave' her daughter to him.

The pastor's brother - who did not want to be identified - said he had warned both Ngwu and his family about the self-proclaimed clergyman's behaviour for a long time but they refused to listen.

He claims the arrest is 'God's wrath falling on his brother', adding: 'God's anger has befallen my brother, we have severally appealed to him to stop what he was doing but he refused. 

'He has colonised our compound, bearing children with recklessness. He accused us of being jealous of him because he is doing the will of God.' 

Sickening: The pastor was arrested for abusing the young girls and women (pictured) - some of whom were married

Pointing at the church's compound, he continued: 'Look at these buildings here... He has converted all of them to himself in the name of vineyard.

'He sacked his betrothed wife who has three children for him and embarked on impregnating married women and young girls. Look at the whole compound littered with children of different sex and age.'

'All members of the vineyard are fools, how can a woman abandon her husband for another man in the name of worshiping God and practice adultery? I cannot get myself involved in this matter.

'Let them sort themselves out with the police but I want the ministry to be shut down completely,' he added.'
