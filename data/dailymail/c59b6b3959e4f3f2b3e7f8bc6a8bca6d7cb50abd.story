Drug shame: Scott Miller, pictured holding up his silver medal at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics

A retired Olympic swimmer arrested with $16,000 in cash and bags of crystal meth in his car told police he earned the money by running an escort agency not drug dealing, a court heard.

Scott Miller, 38, who won silver and bronze for Australia during the 1996 Atlanta Games, was pulled over in a hire car at Mascot in Sydney's south in June.

Officers discovered the bundles of cash and three bags of methamphetamine along with scales, a ledger and several mobile phones and SIM cards, a magistrate was told.

He pleaded guilty to the possession but denied earning the money from drug dealing, the court was told today.

After hearing the evidence, prosecutors today withdrew a charge of drug supply.

Miller's lawyer, Greg Goold, said it would be disputed whether the 'indicia of supply' belonged to him.

'There's
an argument in relation to the ownership... of the ledger, the scales, 
the calculator... not the actual meth itself,' Mr Goold said.

The court also heard Miller was found with 'three small bags of methamphetamine'.

The magistrate was today shown a search warrant video taken after police pulled Miller over.

When asked about the money, Miller told police it was from an escort agency he ran.

Officers did not try to find out if he was telling the truth.

Facing the press: Disgraced former Olympian Scott Miller leaves Waverley Courthouse after a first appearance in Sydney, during a previous court appearance

The
former athlete was again arrested and charged in July with supplying a 
prohibited drug of an indictable quantity after police allegedly 
discovered 7.75 grams of the drug ice during a search at Potts Point in 
Sydney.

He still faces separate drugs charges, relating to his arrest at Potts Point in July.

Police had been conducting surveillance of what they described as a known drug location when they started following the car.

Troubled: Scott Miller, who won a silver medal in the men's 100 meter butterfly at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, is now in rehab after battle with drug abuse

Miller has been undergoing medical treatment for rehabilitation in Melbourne.

Outside the court he said he is very happy with the outcome of today's court proceedings.

'I started rehabilitation in Melbourne a few months to go, I'll go back and finish that off, and when these proceedings are finished you won't see me back here again,' he told Australia's News ABC network.

He said it was hard to watch film footage of his arrest played in court.

'Yeah that was tough, very tough, yeah I've come a long way and I'm not going to go back to that sort of life.'
