Arsene Wenger never knows when he is wrong, and that flaw has cost the Arsenal manager, according to his former midfielder Emmanuel Petit.

Petit, who was part of Wenger's team at Tuesday night's opponents Monaco before joining him at Highbury in 1997, won the double under the Frenchman the next year, and has known the Arsenal boss for three decades.

But as well as praising his former manager's work ethic, the former Gunners star, 44, also questioned Wenger's stubbornness and inability to switch off.

'He's a workaholic, someone who lives for the job,' Petit told France Football. 'He has a passion, almost pathological, for football. He almost forgets to live his own life. He never disconnects.

'For 35 years he has coached, I've know him for nearly 30, and he has never changed. He has another flaw: he does not recognise when he is wrong.'

Petit revealed that, at times of stress, Wenger can be found walking barefoot around the training ground to get back in touch with nature.

'He has tics,' the Premier League winning midfielder continued. For example, when he's fuming and needs to think, he must walk barefoot in the grass. He needs to be in contact with the elements, like in The Matrix!'

However, the former Gunners midfielder did praise Wenger's man management and his work ethic

Wenger's great strength, however, according to Petit, is his ability to get the best out of his players by understanding them on a personal level. 

'Before you are even interested in the football player, he is interested in the individual,' said Petit. 'He attaches great importance to human relations. He is very attentive to detail.'

Petit departed Arsenal in 2000 for a short stint at Barcelona, after playing just one season with the man who would go on to become the club's record goalscorer, Thierry Henry.

But Petit was quick to stress that his compatriot, who has been working back at the club while doing his coaching badges, should not be talked about as Wenger's successor yet. 

Thierry Henry, Arsenal's record goalscorer during two spells at the club, has been tipped to succeed Wenger

But Petit says Henry, who was part of the 2004 Invincibles, should not be thought of as a manager yet

'It's way too early to tell [if Henry can succeed Wenger],' he told RMC Sport. 'We live in a society where fast food is consumed very quickly and we also quickly discard what was consumed. For Henry, as with Zidane, he needs time.

'You do not become a coach just because you pass your degrees. It's like when you become a parent. One becomes a function of his children, we adapt, we learn about ourselves. So getting the degree is one thing. Become a coach week after week, that's something else.'
