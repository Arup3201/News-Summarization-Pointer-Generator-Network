Look! Up in the sky! It's a bird... It's a plane... It's Jeffrey Milstein taking pictures from a chopper!

If you ever wanted to get a look at what America looks like from above (and don't have a drone), MIlstein has you covered.

The New York-based photographer has been using high-resolution camera equipment to capture views from a helicopter with an open door and his latest collection, the Fabricated Landscapes series, features a sky-high look at residential, city, waterside and industrial areas of the United States.

Neighborhoods where the houses are on waterways, Miami, Florida: Unlike some cities, neighborhoods in Miami are integrated with the water

As well as the different housing styles of Los Angeles, there are studies of container ports, marinas packed with the yachts of the wealthy, airports made to look toy-like, and the sprawling highway infrastructure. 

Milstein, who was born in 1944 and received a BA in architecture from UC Berkeley in 1968. has always been interested in flight.

The photographer, architect, and graphic designer may take aerials over cities such as Venice, Lucca or London in the future, according to Conde Nast Traveller. 

Marina del Rey, Los Angeles, California: This community, which has traditionally been a destination for retirees, is becoming popular again

Houses on the water, Miami, Florida: The diverse communities in the area feature many lofts, condominiums and single-family homes

LAX, Los Angeles, California: The airport offers 692 daily flights to 85 domestic cities and 928 weekly flights to 67 cities in 34 countries

Milstein said: 'This series began about two years ago when I was visiting relatives in LA where I grew up and learned to fly as a teenager.

'I was walking around Beverly Hills at the base of Benedict canyon and there were these large estates with big walls and dogs and cameras and guards that would appear if you looked too close. 

'And I thought It might be interesting to get a helicopter and photograph the hidden yards behind the walls

 'When I was young I would fly myself around LA and take pictures. I was fascinated by how things appeared from the air. 

'So for this project I spent many hours flying around LA in a helicopter with the door off shooting with very high resolution equipment so I can blow the prints up to 70 inches for my galleries. 

'I wanted to compare and contrast the way neighborhoods of different economic class appear from the air.'

Container Port, Los Angeles, California: The port is now a  'premier gateway for goods and services and a bustling center for global commerce'

Jeffrey Milstein, the photographer, architect, and graphic designer (above), was born in 1944 and graduated from UC Berkeley in 1968

Container Port, Los Angeles, California: Several hundred species of fish and marine birds call the ecological habitat at the port their home 

Milstein told Daily Mail Online shooting from a helicopter is more expensive than taking photos from a plane, but it 'gives more ability' and can 'go much slower and lower'.

He said: 'I use a stabilizing gyro because there is always some movement. 

'I like to compose graphic images. 

'My background as an architect wants symmetry and straight lines so I have to be in close communication with the pilot in trying to get exactly where I want.

'I like to ponder how things are created and from above you can see how the geography of the landscape affects the arrangement of roads and residential and commercial building sites and understand more about why the city looks the way it does. 

'You can also see the hand of the architect in planned developments in ways you never can from the ground.

'I have always loved flying since I was a boy. 

'Part of that thrill was being able to see everything from the birds eye. 

I hope I can share some of that fascination with these photographs.'

Elevated roadways, Los Angeles, California: Of the 36 largest metro areas, Los Angeles is last in terms of freeway lane miles per resident

He continued: 'The higher the value of the neighborhood the more likely the homes will not be on a grid. 

'The wealthy areas often have yards with pools and tennis courts lined up within feet of each other on opposite sides of a hedge, as opposed to the photo of the trailer park where there is a shared pool. 

'There is a large older housing project in the middle of LA Called Park La brea, built in the 40s that was inspired by the innovative housing of Corbusier in Paris. 

'It combines low level apartments and mid-rise towers that from the air have a mandala like appearance. 

'It was an ingenious plan with common parks and towers placed so there were views from all apartments.'

Milstein added: 'I also include in this group a series from the port of Los Angeles and long beach showing the Lego-like containers and ships and machinery, and the patterns they make.

 'Another series is of small pleasure boat marinas, some with housing. 

'And I added some neighborhoods from Miami where the houses are on waterways.'

Shopping plaza, Santa Monica, California: This plaza was designed by architect Frank Gehry and the location was used in the Terminator 2 film

A neighborhood on the water, Miami, Florida: Milstein noticed expensive homes are less likely to be on a grid than cheaper houses
