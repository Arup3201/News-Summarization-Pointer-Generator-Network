Republicans weren't just big winners in the U.S. Senate races on Tuesday, as they also scored some major victories in the gubernatorial races.

No victory was a bigger upset however than that of Larry Hogan, the businessman who managed to defeat Lieutenant Governor Anthony Brown to become the next governor of Maryland.

This despite the fact that Brown got support from some heavy hitters in the Democratic party, including Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama - who stumped for the candidate just one day before the election.

More big names: brown also got Hillary Clinton to stump for him last Thursday (above), but still lost to businessman Larry Hogan

Huge victory: Hogan's win was big for the Republicans, and he got support in his run from some of the biggest names in the party, like New Jersey Governor Chris Christie (above)

Not to be outdone, Hogan got a visit from New Jersey governor Chris Christie, who supported him at a campaign event last week.

The race was one of the closest of the night, with Brown eventually conceding just after midnight.

Brown's loss is likely a very hard pill for the state's current governor, Martin O'Malley, to swallow, as he will be handing over the keys to the governor's mansion to a Republican for just the second time in 40 years.

Down and out: A dejected Brown gets ready to deliver his concession speech

In other gubernatorial races, Wendy Davis' dream of becoming Texas governor went up in flames as she was trounced by Greg Abbot.

An emotional Davis told her supporters to never give up and keep fighting in her teary-eyed concession speech.

In another closely watched race, Republican Scott Walker defeated Democrat Mary Burke in Wisconsin.

Comforting hand: Wendy Davis was emotional and comforted by her daughter Dru (above) after losing her bid to become governor of Texas 

No help: Mary Burke also lost her bid to be governor, in Wisconsin, and was one of the few candidates to ask President Obama for his support (above)

Burke was one of the few candidates who welcomed President Obama to help her campaign.

Republicans also eked out a big victory in Florida, with Democrat Charlie Crist unable to unseat incumbent Rick Scott.
