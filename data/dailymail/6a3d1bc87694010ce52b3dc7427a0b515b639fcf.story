The Cam'ron Ebola Mask  'provides complete protection while remaining light and comfortable', according to the product's website. It is available online for $19.99. 

Cam'ron, also known as Killa Cam, appears to be taking this bizarre new business venture completely seriously.

His mask boasts a 'polypropylene outer facing' offering a 'soft, fluid protection barrier while the cellulose inner facing assures comfort and breathability'.

The product description continues: 'A full-width nosepiece guarantees proper fit. Latex-free ear loops.'

The vast majority of Ebola's estimated 9,000 victims and 4,500 fatalities have occurred in West Africa. But the United States has been on high alert since the virus claimed its first victim on U.S. soil, when Thomas Duncan succumbed to the deadly disease on October 8.

Two nurses who were treating Mr Duncan also contracted the disease. But both Nina Pham and Amber Vinson are thought to be in stable condition after treatment for the deadly virus.

The growing sense of panic in the United States over the spread of the deadly disease has seen a number of people - particularly those traveling by air - donning protective masks and gloves, CNBC reported.

This is despite the fact that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has made clear that the virus is not airborne and is only spread through contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person who is showing symptoms of the virus.

At the weekend, President Barack Obama spoke out to urge Americans not to succumb to hysteria over Ebola, warning that travel restrictions between the U.S. and West Africa could 'make the situation worse'.

Speaking in his weekly radio and internet address, Obama told listeners: 'Trying to seal off an entire region of the world - if that were even possible - could actually make the situation worse.'

He added: 'This is a serious disease, but we can't give in to hysteria or fear because that only makes it harder to get people the accurate information they need. We have to be guided by the science.'
