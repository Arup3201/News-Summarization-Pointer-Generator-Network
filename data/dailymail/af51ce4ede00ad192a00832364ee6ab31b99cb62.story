A student has made the unconventional decision to fund her entire law degree by stripping - and has even persuaded her fans to stump up for all of her textbooks.

Vanessa Knowles, 25, has been posing semi-nude for 'lads’ mags', webcams and websites since the age of 18.

Two years ago, she decided to enroll on a law course and continue stripping part-time to fund her education.

The future lawyer pockets up to £50,000 a year, with her fans splashing out £2,000 for legal textbooks

She is now set to graduate with a first-class degree from a London university.

While other students are taking out loans or forced to survive on Pot Noodles, Vanessa studies from her central London apartment, orders shopping from Ocado and has paid her £14,000 course fees in full.

Her luxury lifestyle is all thanks to her legion of admirers.

When the 34DD model isn’t studying in the library, she spends her time chatting with her 22,000 fans over a webcam.

Online admirers dish out hundreds of pounds to chat with Vanessa, who poses topless in revealing lingerie.

And although the legal world might frown upon her sideline, it has enabled her to pocket up to £50,000 a year, with her fans even splashing out £2000 for legal textbooks.

She says: 'Doing a law degree is the biggest challenge I could have taken on, and I’ve wanted to become a lawyer since I was a little girl.

'I know the legal industry is conservative - but doing my adult work shouldn’t stop me from being a great lawyer.

'My fans have paid for every one of my 100 textbooks and I encourage them to buy me gifts from an Amazon wish list.

'If I mention something I need for my degree on Twitter then ten minutes later someone has brought it for me.

'They’ve got me so much stationery that I’ve kitted out a home office, and I’m always dressed in designer labels for my work placements.'

The topless model moved to London in 2012, and soon made a name for herself around campus, juggling 16 hours of weekly lectures and classes with her webcam work.

Vanessa, who is currently single, devotes up to 12 hours a week to her fans.

She says: 'I’ve become an internet personality and fans can get pushy trying to meet up with me.

'They have a perception of me as this sexy fantasy and think they can demand my time - they even get upset if I don’t reply to their messages straight away.

'During the first weeks of university some girls on my course Googled me and after they discovered my pictures, they tried to discredit my reputation.

'They looked at my accounts and were laughing at me - but I don’t care, I’m going to graduate with a first and make the most of university, no matter what they say.

'Some of my lecturers know what I do and make cheeky jokes.

'One lecturer asked if I was topless model, and another wanted to know where the girl with the ‘big boobs’ was when I missed class one day.'

Vanessa first turned to stripping after a friend from popular lap-dancing chain Spearmint Rhino set her up with photo-shoots for men's magazines.

Vanessa says she sees no reason why her work in the adult industry should hinder her becoming a lawyer

The model, then 18, posed for Loaded and, despite gaining 11 GCSEs and a dance diploma at college, decided she was having too much fun modelling to go to university straight after school.

She says: 'I understand that people might think it’s degrading selling my body for money, but when I was dancing I felt totally in control.

'I was making four-figure sums every night lap-dancing in my home-town of Leeds, and I didn’t think about going to university.

'My
 boyfriend at the time did get jealous, and sometimes I felt guilty - 
but I’ve always drawn the line at doing anything hardcore.

'My dad passed away before I started dancing, and I don’t think he would have been too pleased - but my mum, Ann-Marie, has never worried about me - she knows I respect myself.'

Soon she was splashing out on designer labels, convertible cars and she was jetting off to spend her summers in Ibiza and the US.

At one time, Vanessa worked for nine months straight - before spending her earnings on a three-month holiday to the Greek Islands.

She says: 'I loved dancing but there were days when it got so boring.

'I saw the same guys, day-in, day-out, and I’d had enough holidays to last me a lifetime.

'My three older sisters have all gone to university and I wanted people to be impressed by more than just my breasts.

'My lap-dancing and webcam work were already teaching me transferable legal skills.

'I was already playing hard ball and negotiating fees with customers, and some guys were saying they felt intimidated by intelligence.

'Law is one of the most challenging careers out there, and I wanted to prove I could be an intellectual.'

Vanessa isn’t worried that a law firm boss might be watching her on webcam one day - but admits that she has committed a few legal blunders.

She says: 'I’ve had some great placements with top law firms, but once I mistakenly emailed an important firm from one of my topless accounts.

'Luckily they didn’t notice, but I was so embarrassed, and it’s always in the back of my mind that doing this might affect my legal career.

'I have had some lawyers tell me that being open about how I made it here isn’t such a bad thing, and I think the industry is becoming more liberal.'

The student wants to do a legal practice course after graduating, before starting a full-time career in Intellectual Property Law.

She says: 'What I do on webcam or what I’ve done in the past shouldn’t be important.

'I’m in constant demand both at university and on my webcam ‘ and I don’t worry about anyone finding out what I do.

'When I become a full-time lawyer I will probably give up stripping, but even after I get my dream job, I’ll still miss getting my kit off.'
