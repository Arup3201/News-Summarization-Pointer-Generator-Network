A mother of two, still on her L plates, has been busted being two and a half times over the legal limit whilst dropping off her children at school.

The 41-year-old from the Gold Coast was caught by the Rapid Action and Patrols officers on Tuesday morning out the front of her children's school.

According to the Gold Coast Bulletin, her breath test showed a blood-alcohol level of 0.124.

A 41-year-old on her learner permit has been busted 2 1/2 times over the legal limit

Police have said the woman was dropping off her two young children at school when breathalyzed

According to the Gold Coast Bulletin, her breath test showed a blood-alcohol level of 0.124

She admitted to have been drinking the night before at a party with her friends but this did not explain why the mother of two had been on her learner permit for 20 years.

Not only was the driver not accompanied by a full license driver or displaying her learner plates, she also had never had her permit renewed. 

She told police that her children (aged 13 and 16) usually catch the bus to Nerang State High School, but she decided to drop them off to discipline one for misbehaving.

'The irresponsible driving behaviour of this person has not only endangered the lives of her children but she has also run the risk of being in a traffic accident,' Inspector Shane Holmes told the Gold Coast Bulletin.

'It is very concerning that people within our community are still not adhering to the dangers of driving while under the influence of alcohol.' 

The woman said her children usually catch the bus but she dropped them off to punish them for misbehaving

She was charged with drink-driving, being an unaccompanied learner driver and failing to display L plates

Inspector Holmes has assured that school zones would be targeted by police as part of an ongoing operation.

'It's hard to fathom how a person could record that reading at that time of the morning,' he said.

'Let alone with kids on board.' 

The 41-year-old was charged with drink-driving, being an unaccompanied learner driver and failing to display her learner plates. 

She will face Southport Magistrates Court next month.
