Apple may still be reeling from last week’s ‘bendgate’ fiasco, but it can take some comfort in the fact its rival Samsung is facing similar issues.

The tech giant’s Note 4 has only been on sale in its native Korea for less than a week, but customers have already started complaining about its build quality.

A photo has emerged that shows a card being placed inside a gap between the phone’s screen, and its outer metal casing - leading the issue to be dubbed ‘gap gate.’

Samsung's Galaxy Note 4 went on sale in the firm's native Korea on Friday, but customers have started complaining about the device's build quality. A photo has emerged that shows a card being placed inside a gap (pictured) between the phone’s screen, and its outer metal casing - dubbed 'gap gate'

Samsung unveiled its 5.7-inch Note 4 at IFA last month, and it launched in China and Korea on Friday. 

It is expected to launch in more regions later this month, including the UK on the 10 October, and the US by the 23 October.

However, reports about these dates vary.

Following the launch in the firm’s home country, IT Today reported that ‘a small number’ of customers had spotted that the screen looked like it was not properly attached to the casing.

Paper and cards were then placed inside the gap in the device, which retails for 957,000 Korean Won (£555 or $900), to prove how wide it was.

It is unclear how many people have been affected by 'gap gate', and whether it relates to a batch of phones or is a wider problem. Samsung said: ‘The reported issue does not impact the functionality or quality of the Note 4'

It is unclear how many people have been affected, and whether the issue relates to a batch of phones or is a more wider problem.

But Samsung has dismissed the concerns.

In a statement, the firm said: ‘The reported issue does not impact the functionality or quality of the Galaxy Note 4.

‘We assure our customers that all Galaxy Note 4 units meet our strict manufacturing and quality control standards.’

The Android device has a 5.7-inch display, is powered by a 2.7GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 processor, comes with a 16MP rear camera and 3.7MP front-facing one. 

The Samsung complaints follow a week of controversy for rival Apple, after users claimed its iPhone 6 Plus bends when placed in a pocket for too long.

Videos were then uploaded showing users bending their phones with just their fingers.

Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller responded: 'With normal use, a bend in iPhone is extremely rare and through our first six days of sale, a total of nine customers have contacted Apple with a bent iPhone 6 Plus.'

Apple shares closed down nearly 4 per cent at $97.87 (£60.26) following the furore, wiping out nearly $23billion (£14.1billion) in market value. However, experts from Consumer Reports suggest that some of these claims may have been exaggerated

However, experts from Consumer Reports suggest that some of these claims may have been exaggerated.

During their own stress tests, they found the iPhone 6 Plus can withstand more force than has been previously claimed - and that it is more sturdy than the HTC One (M8) and the smaller iPhone 6.
