Edward Glazer, one of Malcolm Glazer's six children, has put three million shares in Manchester United up for sale, little more than six months after his father's death.

Glazer Jnr stands to recoup in the region of $45million (£28.7million) by selling around 87 per cent of his 3.45m 'A' shares.

Malcolm Glazer took ownership of United in 2005, but his death in May this year saw his children take an equal split of shares.

Companies often have two different types of shares, called ‘A’ and ‘B’ shares.

The holders of both kinds of share still own an equal amount of a company.

But the main difference is different the shares come with different powers.

The ‘B’ shares in this instance come with voting powers which means the holder has much more say in key decisions about a company when there is a shareholder vote.

A statement released by the Barclays Premier League club and the New York Stock Exchange - where 10 per cent of United's shares are listed - announced the offer of 'Class A Ordinary Shares'. 

It means Edward Glazer, who serves as co-chairman of Tampa Bay Buccaneers and is co-president of the Glazer Family Foundation, is to receive a windfall from the sale, which could be concluded this week.

The other Glazer children with shares are Avram, Kevin, Bryan, Joel and Darcie S. Glazer Kassewitz. 

The statement read: 'Manchester United plc today announced the offering of 3,000,000 of its Class A Ordinary Shares by the Edward S. Glazer Irrevocable Exempt Trust (the 'Selling Shareholder').

'The underwriter will have an option to purchase up to an additional 450,000 Class A Ordinary Shares from the Selling Shareholder.

'Manchester United will not receive any proceeds from the sale of any Class A Ordinary Shares by the Selling Shareholder. The offering is expected to close on December 12, 2014, subject to customary closing conditions.'

Edward Glazer will retain all his 'B' shares, which give the family overall control of United.
