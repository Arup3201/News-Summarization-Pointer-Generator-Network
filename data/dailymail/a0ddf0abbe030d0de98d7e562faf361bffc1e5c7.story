The family of a girl whose toes were amputated by a Macy's escalator is suing the operating company.

Juliana Valdez, then aged 10, was back-to-school shopping with her mother and brother at the store in Paramus, New Jersey, when her right  leg got trapped in the metal plates.

A passer-by hit the emergency stop switch but the top of her foot was already stripped bare of skin, muscle, tendons and nerves.

Crippled: Juliana Valdez, 11, has had 20 surgeries on her foot after getting it trapped in a Macy's escalator

Trauma: Her family is now launching a legal battle against the firm after more than a year of operations

When police arrived, they said, her leg had been pulled into the escalator up to mid-calf. 

Paramedics had to spend almost an hour extracting the child from the machinery. 

However, Macy's refused to terminate the contract with ThyssenKrupp Elevator America Inc.

Since the incident in August 2013, the Germany-based firm, which operates in around 80 countries, has reportedly reaped more than $5.63 billion in sales.

Juliana's parents Juan and Nora Valdez are now launching a six-count federal complaint against the firm, claiming they were third-party beneficiaries in the contract between the store and the company.

'Poor maintenance': Juliana's parents will argue the firm ThyssenKrupp had not properly check their machine

Mangled: Police said Juliana was pulled down to mid-calf by the escalator. This is the shoe she was wearing

Their daughter has had 20 surgeries, including a skin graft, and doctors amputated her second and pinky toes.

A few days into her treatment, her kidneys also started to fail, according to Commercial Appeal. 

Dr Sanjeev Kaul, who treated Juliana at Hackensack University Medical Center, said  doctors removed dead tissue from her foot and cleaned bones that had been blackened by grease from the escalator.

They made surgical holes in her eardrums to equalize pressure so she could be treated with oxygen under high pressure in a hyperbaric chamber to promote healing, Kaul said. 

Months of agony: She even suffered kidney failure in the hospital due to the stress and the trauma, medics said

Now, in a legal complaint, the Valdez family claim ThyssenKrupp was obliged 'to provide inspection, maintenance and repair services for the escalators.' 

That deal, they say, was breached by the careless failure to properly maintain the escalator. 

A judge will now consider their six-count federal complaint alleges negligent maintenance and repair of the escalator; negligence in Macy's supervision of inspector ThyssenKrupp; emotional distress; breach of contract;  and punitive damages.

They also claimed loss of consortium - a breakdown of family relationship caused by the incident - but that was dismissed.

Macy's will simultaneously pursue action against ThyssenKrupp.
