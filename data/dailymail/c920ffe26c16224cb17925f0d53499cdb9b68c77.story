Napoli have stepped up their interest in signing Swansea striker Michu.

The Italians are keen on a deal for the 28-year-old but want to check on his fitness following surgery on his ankle.

They would like to take him on loan with view to a permanent deal if medical checks prove he has the all-clear.

Out: Swansea City midfielder Michu has not travelled on their pre-season tour to the United States

On his way? Michu is rated at £15million by Swansea but Napoli would be open to an initial loan

Spanish radio reported a deal had already been agreed on Saturday but negotiations are ongoing.

Swansea would not want a loan and if they agree to his departure would want a reasonable fee for a player valued at £15million last year.

Napoli have also been offered QPR midfielder Adel Taarabt who was on loan at AC Milan last season.

However, Milan have so far been unwilling to pay £4.5m for the Moroccan.

Meanwhile, Swansea are keen to re-sign Gylfi Sigurdsson from Tottenham but the London club want £10m.

Tottenham do have interest though in left-back Ben Davies and Liverpool target Michel Vorm as they seek back-up for goalkeeper Hugo Lloris.

Return? Swansea are keen to bring Gylfi Sigurdsson from Tottenham back but the London club want £10m
