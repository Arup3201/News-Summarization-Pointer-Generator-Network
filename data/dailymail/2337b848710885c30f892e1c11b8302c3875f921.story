The whistleblower who caught an MP playing Candy Crush Saga during a Commons meeting will face no punishment, a Parliamentary watchdog revealed today.

A leaked photo showed Tory Nigel Mills playing the game on his taxpayer-funded iPad when he was supposed to be listening to evidence on pensions and insurance.

But instead of investigating the MP, who remains on the Work and Pensions Committee, Commons officials launched a probe into who leaked the photo.

No punishment: The whistleblower who leaked this photo of Tory MP Nigel Mills playing Candy Crush Saga on his iPad will not be punished, Commons authorities have confirmed, after a 'mole-hunt' to find the culprit

Could one of these be the Candy Crush whistleblower? Footage  showed these two people were alternately sitting behind the MP - although it is possible the incident was filmed by someone hidden from view

That sparked criticism over the decision to pursue the 'mole' rather than Mr Mills himself.

Footage of the meeting, held last Monday, showed a male and a female sound technician sitting behind Mr Mills who both appeared to be using mobile phones.

However, it was not clear if one of them was responsible for filming him or whether another person off-camera captured his gaming on film. 

A Commons spokesman insisted the investigation was 'standard procedure' because it is against Parliamentary rules to film inside Westminster without permission.

Those who break the rules can be barred from the Parliamentary estate, which includes MPs' offices and meeting rooms. 

Today, just a day after the probe was launched, it was confirmed the whistleblower will face no further action.

Distracted: The MP for Amber Valley in Derbyshire was spotted closely studying his iPad and swiping the screen with his finger as he attempted to complete levels of popular app the Candy Crush Saga 

Apology: Mr Mills vowed he would not play the game - popular even with David Cameron - in meetings again

A House of Commons spokesman said: 'It is standard procedure that any breach of the filming and photography rules brought to the attention of the House is investigated.

'The Serjeant at Arms has concluded the investigation into this breach and has issued a reminder of the current rules; no further action will be taken.'

The Serjeant at Arms, a post which dates to the 1400s, has scope to impose low-level punishments while 'serious breaches' are reported to the Commons Administration Committee.

The spokesman could not confirm whether the whistleblower was actually tracked down or whether the 'reminder' was a general one.

Mr Mills, who is defending a majority of just 536 in Amber Valley, initially told The Sun he would 'try' not to be distracted by the game again.

He later issued a full apology, saying: 'I apologise unreservedly for my behaviour at the committee meeting and realise it fell short of what is expected of a Member of Parliament.

Addictive: Candy Crush is incredibly popular - with more than 700 million games played on mobile devices

‘I guarantee it will not happen again. 

'It is a fantastic privilege to represent Amber Valley and I hope constituents will continue to support my campaigns.'

Gail Dolman, a Labour councillor in his constituency, said: ‘I think it’s disgusting. He’s an MP and I find it very worrying.’

More than a billion people every day play the 'addictive' game Candy Crush Saga, in which players have to line up at least three sweets of the same colour in a row on a constantly-shifting grid. 

David Cameron – himself a self-confessed games addict – defended Mr Mills.

‘I know him well, he fights very hard in his constituency for people in Derbyshire, he works very hard in Parliament,’ the Prime Minister said.

‘I’m sure he will be embarrassed and he will work even harder in the future.’

Mr Cameron previously admitted to being addicted to mobile games Fruit Ninja and Angry Birds.

Asked what level the PM had reached on Candy Crush, his spokesman said: ‘On that line of questioning, Game Over.’
