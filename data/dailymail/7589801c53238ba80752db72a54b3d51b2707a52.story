A close friend of Peaches Geldof has revealed how the young model craved to escape from her 'shallow' celebrity lifestyle so she could be a stay-at-home mother for her two young sons.

Michele Kavanagh, part of the Gentle Parenting Group in Maidstone, Kent, of which Peaches was a member, said the 25-year-old found it difficult that none of her famous friends understood what is was like to be a mother.

But, despite the close-knit nature of the group, Ms Kavanagh said none of the mothers had any idea about Peaches' heroin habit and were 'shocked' when she died.

Peaches wanted to escape the 'shallow' celebrity circles in which she was involved to become a stay-at-home mother, just like her new friends in the mother and baby group

Taking about Peaches' celebrity world, Ms Kavanagh told the Sunday Mirror: 'She really wanted to be out of it. All she wanted was a normal life.'

The 28-year-old added: 'She said she found the world of celebrity very shallow since she'd become a mother.

'She told me a lot of her famous friends didn't have children and didn't understand her if she spoke about how tiring it was to be a mum.'

Peaches had joined the group, which promotes 'attachment parenting', in September last year.

Attachment parenting is based on the belief that the first year of a child's life defines its emotional future and parents should therefore remain as physically close to their child as possible.

After she joined the group, Peaches and Ms Kavanagh became close friends and would often meet at a local cafe, Pops', or go to Nando's for lunch. They also had play dates with their young children, Ms Kavanagh said.

The mother-of-one said Peaches 'seemed happy', but confided in her new friends that she wanted to focus her attention entirely on her sons.

But, as the main breadwinner, Peaches - who found parenting 'exhausting' - felt the pressure to keep working.

Peaches was frustrated that her other celebrity friends did not know what it was like to be a mother, as she was to her sons Phaedra and Astala

Ms Kavanagh added that Peaches clearly missed her mother - particularly once she had children of her own - and did not have as close a relationship with her father Bob Geldof.

In regards to Peaches' death in April, Ms Kavanagh said the group were completely shocked, especially as Peaches would not even drink coffee because it 'made her hyper'.

After she died, her son Phaedra was left in the house alone for up to 17 hours. Ms Kavanagh said today that Peaches would have been 'heartbroken' if she had known her son would be alone for all that time.

Earlier this week, a friend of Peaches Geldof's late mother Paula Yates claimed she desperately tried to confront the young model over her drug abuse, as friends around her 'turned blind eyes'.

Gerry Agar, the former publicist of Paula Yates, said she wrote a letter to Peaches six years ago in a bid to stop her suffering the same fate as her mother,

Ms Yates died of an accidental heroin overdose when Peaches was 11.

But she said Peaches, a mother-of-two, suffered after those around her 'said nothing' - despite the 25-year-old relapsing.

She told Grazia magazine: 'I knew she was in trouble with heroin years ago and I tried to confront her about it.

'So many people around her knew about it but said nothing. But I'd lost her mother and my best friend to heroin and I didn't want to lose Peaches.'

Peaches was found dead at her £1m home in Wrotham, Kent, in April, by her husband Thomas Cohen.

Just a few hours before her death, she posted a picture of herself and her mother on the social networking site Instagram, adding the caption: ‘Me and my mum.’ Miss Yates died in 2000, aged 41.

At an inquest into Peaches' death, the court heard stashes of heroin, burned spoons and almost 80 syringes were scattered around the family's country home.

North West Kent Coroner Roger Hatch said the sometime television presenter, model and journalist had been trying to wean herself off drugs and was clean five months before her death.

She had battled the addiction for three years and had been taking the heroin substitute methadone and having counselling.

In November 2013, a drugs test showed her to be clean and Mr Cohen believed she had defeated the habit.

But Mr Cohen, a 24-year-old musician, told the inquest she relapsed in February and was hiding heroin in the loft.

Mr Hatch said Peaches' death was not quite history repeating itself, in regards to Miss Yates' death, because Miss Geldof had tried to break her addiction and had returned to the drug for reasons no one would ever know.

She had 3mg per litre of diamorphine, the chemical name for heroin, in her blood. Her mother had 0.3mg when she died.

Months before she died, Peaches appeared on This Morning opposite Katie Hopkins to debate the pros and cons of Attachment Parenting.

The heated discussion, which took place in front of hosts Philip Schofield and Holly Willoughby, saw the pair comes to blows over the issue.

Their public spat was later carried on over Twitter and in Ms Hopkins' newspaper column.
