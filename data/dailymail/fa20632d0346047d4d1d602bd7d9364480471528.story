Not many people would turn to a sat nav, a photograph or a pendulum to find a lost pet. 

But that's exactly what one cat lover did, using powers of the supernatural to find missing moggies and reunite them with their owners. 

'Dowsing' is the dangling of a pendulum and using the direction in which it moves to find a lost object.

Although some may think this slightly strange, Brian Bowes, 48, says that the ancient art of dowsing shouldn't be knocked after he found four cats using his pendulum which he bought on eBay and is made out of crystal. 

The father of two from Shotley Bridge, County Durham, is regularly contacted by panic-stricken owners asking to help find their missing pet and explained that the process of finding the stray tabbies has been proven to work.

He said: 'People contact me through Facebook, and send me a picture of their lost cat, its name and the area where it went missing. I keep a picture of the cat on the laptop next to me with a sat nav map on my phone. 

'First I have to clear my head of absolutely everything so my mind is completely empty.

'Then I hold the pendulum above the map on my phone and ask questions, such as: 'Is the cat alive? Is it injured? Is it being kept in a house?' The pendulum will move clockwise for yes and anti-clockwise for no. 

'When I ask it to show me where the cat is, the pendulum will then sway to a certain area on the map. 

'I keep zooming in on the area until I can zoom in no more and I get to a street name. In total it usually takes about half an hour for me to find where the cat might be, and I contact the owner to let them know.

'Where I've been successful I usually get within 50 metres of where the cat was found, which is good considering I only started to do this seriously a few months ago.' 

Brian, who delivers catalogues for a living, also used his psychic powers to find his own pet cat Sam nearly four years ago when she went missing. 

He said: 'This was the first time I decided to use a sat nav map instead of a map in a book, and the pendulum guided me to an area not too far away from where I live. 

'I put up leaflets straightaway and on that same day, someone got in touch to say she was sleeping in their shed - in the same place that the pendulum guided me to.'

But this wasn't the last time the method of dowsing would come to the rescue when another of Brian's cats went missing a year later. 

This time, Merry the cat was found stuck in a tree close to home but thankfully Brian, who now has five cats, hasn't needed the pendulum again for his own pets. But the dowsing enthusiast is clearly in high demand as up to three or four people a day contact him for his help. 

He said: 'I saw some owners putting pleas for help on the Consett Cats charity Facebook page after their cats went missing. I thought I could help these people out, and in October I posted an offer to dowse for cats on the charity's lost and found Facebook page.

'So far I have done it thirty times- for some owners I've done it once or twice, and for others I have done it for them many times. 

'Up until now I've managed to find a missing cat in Sunderland and another in the Chester Le Street area. The owners were absolutely over the moon, they couldn't believe it. 

'The owner of the cat found in Chester Le Street went exactly to the estate where I told her to go and at first there was no luck.

'But when she went back a second time, she shouted for her and the cat just walked up to her from out of nowhere.

Mr Bowes is confident his methods can be most effective to help owners find their lost pets

'That was really spooky. 'After that it has just sort of snowballed from there. I've even had people messaging me to help find their dogs. 'I do try to help people as often as I can but it's usually no more than a few times a week after work in my spare time.' 

He added: 'I had heard of dowsing rods but the first time I heard about dowsing using a pendulum was when I saw someone on the TV using one to find a lost child.

'I decided to try it for myself and at first, I got my son to hide a push pop around the house. Using a map of the house that I drew and the pendulum I bought on ebay, I managed to find where he had hidden it.' 

Although Brian admits that dowsing is a more unconventional way of finding lost pets, he tells sceptics to give it a try first. 

He said: 'It is unusual. If I had never heard of it before I would think that I'm losing the plot! 'I've been dowsing for four years now and finding the cats has totally proved to me that it does work. It could be a ghost pushing the pendulum for all I know. 

'I can't explain it and I don't know how it actually works, but it does, and I'm going to keep on doing it as long as I'm helping people. 

'Give it a go and see for yourself.'
