Daley Blind is set to join Manchester United from Ajax for £13.8million.

The two clubs agreed the fee on Friday, and the player just needs to agree personal terms, which is expected to be a formality.

Blind has not been included in the Ajax squad for their match at Groningen on Sunday after he was given permission by the Dutch club to hold talks with United.

Blind's medical will take place this weekend in Manchester before he completes his move.

United tweeted on Saturday morning: 'Manchester United has reached agreement with Ajax to sign Daley Blind, subject to a medical and personal terms. A further announcement will be made when the process is complete.'

United have been linked with the versatile Dutch international throughout the summer, and the deal comes just days after Ajax director of football Marc Overmars said Blind would not be sold on the cheap. 

Blind, who can play at left back or as a defensive midfielder worked with Louis van Gaal at the World Cup, and has been keen to link up again with the United coach.
