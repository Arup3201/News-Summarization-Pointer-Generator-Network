At $60 million (£39 million) to send a satellite to orbit, one of the biggest challenges facing space exploration is cost.

But the US military believes it has a solution; Use fighter jets instead of rockets to get satellites and probes off the ground.

It says this will bring cost of launch down to just $1 million (£650,000), while cutting launch times from a few months to just a few hours.

The US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) is working on a new way to launch low-orbit satellites, uses US fighter jets instead of expensive rockets

The US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) has now released created a concept video of how the process would work.

It shows how the fighter jet will begin a vertical ascension, holding onto the mini-rocket in what has been named the Airborne Launch Assist Space Access (Alasa) program.

Once it hits a certain height, the mini-rocket disconnects from the fighter jet, and begins to push to low-orbit with its payload.

In the video, the first stage ignites, and eventual separates. The second stage then ignites and the payload fairing falls away burning up in Earth's atmosphere.

After taking off from the runway, the fighter jet will begin a vertical ascension, holding onto the mini-rocket.

Once it hits a certain height, the mini-rocket disconnects from the fighter jet, and begins to push to low-orbit with its payload.

The first stage ignites, and eventual separates. The second stage then ignites and the payload fairing falls away burning up in Earth's atmosphere.

The second stage then continues on its journey to low-earth orbit where, once it gets into position, the payload deploys.

'We've made good progress so far toward Alasa's ambitious goal of propelling 100-pound satellites into low Earth orbit within 24 hours of call-up, all for less than $1 million per launch,' said Bradford Tousley, director of Darpa's Tactical Technology Office.

'We're moving ahead with rigorous testing of new technologies that we hope one day could enable revolutionary satellite launch systems that provide more affordable, routine and reliable access to space.'

Darpa is currently favouring the use of F-15 planes that do not require modifications to carry out launches.

Launches of satellites by governments requires scheduling years in advance for the few available slots at the nation's limited number of launch locations.

This slow, expensive process is causing a bottleneck in placing essential space assets in orbit.

The current Alasa design envisions launching a low-cost, expendable launch vehicle from conventional aircraft.

Serving as a reusable first stage, the plane would fly to high altitude and release the launch vehicle, which would carry the payload to the desired location.

'Alasa seeks to overcome the limitations of current launch systems by streamlining design and manufacturing and leveraging the flexibility and re-usability of an air-launched system,' said Mitchell Burnside Clapp, program manager.

'We envision an alternative to ride-sharing for satellites that enables satellite owners to launch payloads from any location into orbits of their choosing, on schedules of their choosing, on a launch vehicle designed specifically for small payloads.'

Perhaps the most daring technology Alasa is attempted to create is a new high-energy monopropellant, which aims to combine fuel and oxidiser into a single liquid

Darpa is now working on designing commercial-grade avionics and composite structures.

Perhaps the most daring technology Alasa is attempted to create is a new high-energy monopropellant, which aims to combine fuel and oxidiser into a single liquid.

If successful, the monopropellant would allow simpler designs and reduced manufacturing and operation costs.

Alasa also aims to reduce infrastructure costs by using runways instead of fixed vertical launch sites, automating operations and avoiding unnecessary services.

'Small satellites in the Alasa payload class represent the fastest-growing segment of the space launch market,' Burnside Clapp said.

'Darpa expects this growth trend to continue as small satellites become increasingly more capable.' 

Current plans call for the first Alasa launch late this year, with a total of 12 Alasa launches planned through mid-2016.
