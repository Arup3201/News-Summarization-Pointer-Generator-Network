Thirteen-year-old Devalon Armstrong has pleaded guilty to negligent homicide, after killing his five-year-old sister with wrestling moves he had seen on television.

Viloude Louis died from the brutal beating on June 16 in Terrytown, New Orleans. Armstrong had originally been charged 
with manslaughter, but took a plea deal at the trial in Jefferson Parish
Juvenile Court on Tuesday in return for the less serious charge.

It means he will spend up to five years in a juvenile detention centre and may be free by the time he turns 18.

Tragic: Viloude Louis died from a brutal beating meted out to her by her step-brother, who has pleaded guilty to a charge of negligent homicide

If he’d been found guilty of manslaughter, he would have been jailed until he was 21.

The
ruling came after Armstrong hand-wrote a statement in court, Judge 
Andrea Janzen having deemed his interview with detectives after the 
death as inadmissible, because neither he nor his mother, who attended, 
would have understood the legal obligations of what was happening.

He
wrote the statement with shackled hands as his mother, 39-year-old Haitian immigrant Allourdes Desvallons, sobbed nearby and
his step-father, Viloude’s father Vilger, looked on with a blank expression, 
The New Orleans Advocate reported.

In
the statement Armstrong admitted playing with Viloude ‘in a bad way’ 
and hitting her on the back and stomach 15 to 20 times, the paper said.

He also admitted using ‘body slams’ that he’d seen wrestlers John Cena and Mark Henry perform.

The little girl had suffered broken ribs, internal bleeding and a lacerated liver.

The
teenager, who is also known as Armstrong Desvallons, told officers 
after his arrest that their mother was out of the house when the incident took place.

Paramedics found the girl unresponsive and she was pronounced dead a short time later.

Armstrong was arrested after a coroner investigation found the girl died of multiple injuries, two days after the death.

Devalon
told investigators the girl had a stomach ache and went upstairs to 
brush her teeth, and 30 minutes later he found her on the floor 
complaining her stomach still hurt, Jefferson Parish Sheriff's spokesman
Col. John Fortunato said.

The
teenager claimed he took the girl downstairs to the sofa and called 911
when he saw she was no longer breathing. Dispatchers told him to start 
CPR and paramedics arrived on the scene.

The
coroner's office said there did not appear to be any outward signs of 
injury and her death was left as unclassified, but then Devalon told 
detectives he had been practicing World Wrestling Entertainment-style 
moves on the girl, The Times-Picayune reported earlier this year.

Hearing: The trial took place at Jefferson Juvenile Court

He
said that even when his little half sister said she was in pain, he 
continued to carry out the moves on her. Detectives added that he 
appeared to be enjoying talking about the assault.

The Sheriff's office reclassified her death as a homicide and Devalon was arrested on suspicion of second-degree murder.

Speaking after Tuesday's trial, Mrs Desvallons told The New Orleans Advocate that she forgave her son.

She said: 'God asks us to forgive. Yes, I forgive him.'

Janzen will now consider his sentence.
