In total 50 all-star players of different religious backgrounds ranging from Islam to Buddhism were invited to take part in the game at the Olympic Stadium in Rome. 

The exhibition was co-hosted by the Pupi Foundation, a Buenos Aires-based charity founded by the former Inter Milan midfielder Javier Zanetti, alongside Scholas Occurentes, an educational entity launched by the Pope.

Zanetti captained the PUPI side while Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon took charge of the  SCHOLAS. As expected, the exhibition game was a goal fest intent on entertaining the audience and finished 6-3 to the PUPI side. 

Inter Milan striker Mauro Icardi scored a hat-trick for Pupi with further goals scored by former Chelsea striker Andriy Shevchenko.

However, it was Scholas who took the lead in the first-half through Roma forward Juan Iturbe before the most nostalgic goal of the night involved Maradona setting up former Italy international Baggio with a delightful lobbed pass for Scholas's second.

Eyebrows were raised when Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger chose to attend the match as manager of the Scholas side instead of keeping pace of events on the final day of the transfer window.
