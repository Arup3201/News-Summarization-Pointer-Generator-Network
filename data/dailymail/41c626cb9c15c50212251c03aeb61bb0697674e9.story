Amazon is facing renewed competition from Main Street as a recent study has found retail stores can be up to 25 per cent cheaper than the internet retailer on identical items.

Researchers discovered prices for a basket of 30 items at the Bed Bath & Beyond chain were on average 6.5 per cent less than the internet giant's.

The study by analysts BB&T found that once you factor in the 20 per cent off coupons that Bed Bath & Beyond regularly send to customers, the price gap increases to 25 per cent.

Products are seen stacked at one of Amazon's many warehouses. Latest figures show the internet retailer is facing renewed competition from the high streets where many products can now be found cheaper

One item, a shower curtain was $24.99 at Bed Bath and Beyond but cost $32.39 at Amazon representing a 23 per cent difference before any coupon discount, the Wall Street Journal reports.

Another item, a Bormioli Rocco Misura carafe, was listed for $4.99 at Bed Bath and Beyond, but $16.61 on Amazon, according to BB&T. The carafe is currently selling on Amazon for $6.95 plus $4.50 shipping.

BB&T spokesman Anthony Chukumba who oversaw the analysis told ABC: 'What it comes down to is retailers realize that to remain relevant they’ve got to invest in their prices.

'They have to lower their prices to remain more competitive with Amazon.

'People are not just shopping at Amazon because it’s cheaper. It’s a great shopping experience,'

He said: 'We are becoming increasingly 
concerned Bed Bath & Beyond is sacrificing gross margin in order to 
drive top-line growth.'

Meanwhile electronics retailer Best Buy, 
which was not so long ago being written off as an Amazon casualty, has 
experienced a surge in growth as they develop new tactics to compete 
with internet retailers.

Best Buy now guarantees to match its prices with Amazon in a bid to customers merely using its stores as a showroom before buying the products cheaper online.

Quarterly results announced yesterday 
showed Best Buy to be the second best performer on the stock market, up 
almost 194 per cent in the past year.

Amazon
has also been hit by the fact it is now being required to pay sales 
tax in markets like California, Texas, New Jersey and Florida, where in 
the past it was exempt.

The company is also facing vigorous competition from online retailers.

Overstock.con today announced it will match Amazon on books prices.

A month ago it had promised to undercut Amazon by 10 per cent but Amazon quickly responded by offering to match the discount.

Overstock chairman Patrick Byrne said: 'Last month we started a book pricing war with Amazon.

'We’re hoping to continue that battle, in a way that lessens any harm to the mom-and-pop booksellers we consider our comrades in arms.'
