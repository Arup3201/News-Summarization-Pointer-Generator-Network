Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden was hospitalized last week after experiencing 'an episode of disorientation and weakness' and he is now undergoing medical tests in Houston, according to the White House.Â 

Vice President Joe Biden accompanied his
son to Houston on Monday morning, where doctors are trying to determine
the cause of his symptoms, the White House said.

The younger Biden, 44, suffered a mild stroke in 2010. He and his wife, Hallie, have two children.

Biden began experiencing the symptoms Wednesday night after driving to Indiana for a family vacation, according to Jason Miller, a spokesman for the Delaware Department of Justice.

He was admitted to Northwestern 
Memorial Hospital in Chicago that night and on Thursday morning he 
traveled to Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia, according to 
the Associated Press.

Biden was later discharged and spent the weekend at home.

He tweeted a picture of himself and his father on Sunday around 2 p.m. with the message: 'Pop & I got a chance to talk to Newark National LL a little earlier. Inspiring group. Can't wait to watch tonight.'

He was referring to the Newark National Little League team, which played in the Little League World Series on Sunday.

Beau Biden was elected as Delaware's attorney 
general in 2006 and two years later he deployed to Iraq as a captain 
with the Delaware Army National Guard. He returned from Iraq in 
September 2009.

He is around the same age that his father was when he suffered from a brain aneurysm in 1988.

The elder Biden made a full recovery after undergoing emergency surgery for the aneurysm at Walter Reed Hospital. A second aneurysm was discovered a few months later through screening and removed.

A brain aneurysm is a bulging blood vessel that can burst when blood pressure forces it out like a balloon.
