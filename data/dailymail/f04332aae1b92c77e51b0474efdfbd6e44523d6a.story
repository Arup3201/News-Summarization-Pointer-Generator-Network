Tottenham have developed a reputation this season for finding the target late on in games, but it is in fact local rivals Arsenal that have scored the most injury-time goals in the Premier League.

Football statistics company WhoScored.com identified that the Gunners have scored an incredible seven times in the closing stages of matches in 2014-15, four more than any other side in the top flight.

On the opening day of the season Aaron Ramsey scored a 91st minute-winner against Crystal Palace at the Emirates, remarkably it is the only one of the seven injury-time goals that have converted a draw into three points.

Arsene Wenger's side went on to score another five goals in time added on before the end of November, including Olivier Giroud's late strike to rescue a point against Everton in August.

Summer signing Alexis Sanchez and France international Giroud have both scored two of the late goals, while Ramsey and Danny Welbeck have one each.

Arsenal's latest injury-time goal came in last weekend's 5-0 demolition of Aston Villa when Hector Bellerin rounded off an easy win in the 92nd minute.

North London rivals Tottenham have netted three goals in injury time but have grabbed the headlines because each of the late strikes earned Mauricio Pochettino's side a win.

Cristian Eriksen scored after 90 minutes against Hull as Spurs recorded a 2-1 win, while the club won by the same scoreline against Aston Villa as Harry Kane netted his first Premier League goal of the season.

Liverpool have also scored three goals in injury time, while Crystal Palace and Sunderland have both scored twice in time added on.
