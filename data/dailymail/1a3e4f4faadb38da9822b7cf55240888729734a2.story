There is something very decadent and a little bit naughty about staying at a hotel in your home town.

The idea that you could whizz your date upstairs at any point throughout dinner for a different kind of 'dessert' adds a certain frisson to proceedings.

In reality, a good hotel dinner means that you will probably overeat and drink just enough to find yourself fully clothed and snoozing though Graham Norton as Friday night comes to a close, rather than road testing the bedroom furniture.

But the fact that you COULD be swinging from the spotlights remains. And the new rooms at London's Hoxton Hotel could be just the place to plan that sexy city rendez-vous.

The Hoxton Hotel in London's Shoreditch has had a revamp

The design hotel has been a destination for the young, urban traveller for a while now thanks to its buzzing Shoreditch location, Soho House restaurant and pretty prices (booked in advance rooms start at just £49 per night).

But in London keeping your cool is an ongoing operation, and with stylish new neighbours the Ace Hotel and Bethnal Green's Town Hall muscling in on it's patch The Hoxton has given itself a mini facelift to keep things interesting.

On the Friday night my husband and I stayed, the lobby (which doubles as the bar and has recently been refreshed with new seating and lighting) was JUMPING by the time we checked in at 7pm.

Weaving through the handsome but already loud crowd we winced inwardly as we remembered that we had forgotten to pack earplugs. And then winced at our wincing. What kind of old farts worry about the noise in a city centre hotel on a FRIDAY night?

We needn't have worried (or winced) though, The Hox - as it likes to be known - might like to party, but it also knows that a good night's sleep is key for busy girls and boys wanting to make the most of a city break, and our third room floor room was perfectly peaceful.

As well as the 'East London' design touches like Roberts Radios and random collections of cool-looking books that you won't have time to read, the renovated rooms feature black out curtains, frette bedding, oversized mirrors and a perfectly-sized desk and tech area for all that Instagram planning.

Leather armchairs, pop art prints and parquet flooring add a stylish touch to an affordable city room and the bathrooms are slick and sexy, decked out in dark grey and featuring low-level lighting.

East London cool: New bedrooms feature stylish touches and the bathrooms are sleek and simple

As long-term Londoners, instead of seizing the moment and exploring the area (the hotel is brilliantly placed for Liverpool Street and the City, Spitalfields market, Old Street and Hackney) we seized a red leather booth three floors down to people watch as we ate dinner.

Downstairs the bar has been opened out to allow more beautiful things to come and hang while drinking Porn Star Martinis.

With the restaurant being so close to the bar the atmosphere and service was hectic - we were served by four different people over the course of the meal - but the diner-style food: fiery jalapeño bites followed by a perfect burger complete with secret sauce and crispy bacon for me, and a halloumi and chickpea salad (generous on the cheese) for the veggie, was delicious.

To summarise the people-watching was top notch, the cocktails were top shelf... and Ant and Dec were top lads on Graham Norton. What more could you ask for on a Friday night?

The lobby has been opened out redecorated ready to receive more beautiful people

Rooms start at £49 and include a light breakfast delivered to your room.
