Samsung has officially launched its Galaxy Note 3, as well as the Galaxy Gear smartwatch, in 58 countries.

The Galaxy Gear smartwatch costs £299, while the Note 3 - dubbed 'phablet' because it's a cross between a phone and a tablet - costs around £599.

Speaking at the launch event, the Korean firm also announced plans to launch a smartphone with a curved display in October.

The announcement was made by Samsung's mobile business head of strategic marketing D.J Lee at the Galaxy Note 3 launch event in Seoul.

However, he did not give anymore details about the rest of the phone's features, price or worldwide availability. 

Curved displays are already seen on large-screen TVs made by Samsung as well as rival LG and costs around £8,000. They have the benefit of providing a wider, clearer viewing angle, for example.

Speaking at the event in Seoul, D.J Lee said: 'We plan to introduce a smartphone with a curved display in South Korea in October.'

Curved displays are an early stage in
screen evolution which is shifting to bendable or foldable designs, 
eventually allowing mobile and wearable gadgets to take on new forms.

In January Samsung, which has taken over
from Apple as the global smartphone leader, showed off prototype 
products with a flexible screen and a display that extends from the side
of a device.

Samsung also announced plans to launch a phone with a curved display from October. Curved displays are already seen on large-screen TVs sold by Samsung, pictured, as well as rival LG and cost around £8,000. They have the benefit of providing a wider, clearer viewing angle, for example

800 MHz processor

1.63 inch Super AMOLED screen

1.9 Megapixel camera, Auto Focus Camera

Sound and Shot 720P video recording

Two microphones, 1 Speaker

4GB Internal memory plus 512 MB (RAM)

Dimensions: 36.8 x 56.6 x 11.1 mm

Weight: 73.8g

Standard battery: Li-ion 315mAh

Rumours before Samsung launched its Galaxy Gear smartwatch in August believed it would have with a flexible display, however, the device has a solid 2-inch screen fitted to a traditional watch strap.

But technology firms have yet to figure out how to mass produce the parts cheaply and come up with display panels that can be as thin as a sheet and highly heat resistant.

Cambridge-based Plastic Logic is an expert on flexible displays and has created a number of prototypes and devices, including the 10.7-inch PaperTab tablet and the PocketBook CoverReader that is set to be a thin and light flip cover for HTC, Sony and Samung phones.

Currys and PC World announced that LG's Curved OLED TV is now available to order online, while customers will be able to view and purchase the TV in selected stores from Saturday.

The LG TV doesn’t use a 
backlight source because it uses organic 
light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) technology.

This gives deeper 
black levels and 'the most natural contrast ever.'
