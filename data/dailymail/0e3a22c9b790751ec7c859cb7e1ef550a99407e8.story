Former Aston Villa and Rangers manager Alex McLeish has been named the new boss of Racing Genk.

The 55-year-old has joined the Belgian club for the next two seasons having left Nottingham Forest in 2013.

On the Racing Genk Facebook page, the club said: 'KRC Genk is proud to present its new trainer: Alex McLeish. he signed a contract for two seasons. Welcome Mr Alex McLeish.

The club added on their website that their new boss would be presented to the press on Monday.

He will take over with Genk 13th in the 16-team Jupiler Pro League, having collected just three points from their four games so far.

McLeish succeeds Emilio Ferrera, who was sacked after the 3-1 opening loss to Mechelen last month. Ferrera's assistant Pierre Denier was handed the reins on a temporary basis while the club sought a permanent replacement.

McLeish - who has also managed Scotland - guided Birmingham City to League Cup success in 2011 before joining rivals Aston Villa the following summer.

However, McLeish managed just a year at Villa Park before getting the sack following a disappointing campaign.
