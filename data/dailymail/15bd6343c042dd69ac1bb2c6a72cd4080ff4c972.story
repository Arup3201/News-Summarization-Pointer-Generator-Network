A West Virginia man suspected of shooting a man in his home escaped from state authorities on Monday and is on the loose.

Police are urgently seeking information on the whereabouts of Rocco Jesse Zuccaro, 30, who is charged with the murder of Jason Lee Pratz, 30, in 2013.

Zuccaro was found incompetent to stand trial in late February and reportedly escaped from William R Sharpe Jr Hospital in Weston around 4.20pm by climbing over a wall.

He was undergoing a mental evaluation at the time, according to WBOY. 

 The six-foot 170lb man is from Burgettstown, Pennsylvania, west of Pittsburgh, which is a two-hour drive from Weston.

He is wearing a dark pullover and dark pants with a rip on the left leg and has dark hair, a mustache and glasses. 

Jason Lee Pratz, a former medical worker, was killed at his home in McKinleyville, West Virginia, on February 2013. 

Someone had also tried to set fire to his home before the shooting, WTRF reported.

Zuccaro was arrested in Pennsylvania and found fit to stand trial in September last year after previous issues about mental competency.

Lieutenant Michael Baylous of the West Virginia State Police told the Daily Mail Online that they are not releasing more information about the possible direction of his travel for fear that the suspect could see it.

The suspect's lawyer says that his client is mentally ill, though the man has previously refused to take medication prescribed for him, according to the Weirton Daily Times. 

Earlier this year he was sentenced to 90 days at William Sharpe to 'regain competence' and the trial date was pushed back to July. 

West Virginia State Police advised people who may come in contact with Zuccaro not to approach him and contact them with any information about his possible location.

Lieutenant Baylous said that the murder suspect was 'a danger to the public'.
