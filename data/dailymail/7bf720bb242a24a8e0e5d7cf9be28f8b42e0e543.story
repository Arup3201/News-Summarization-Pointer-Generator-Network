The man who made stars of Diana Rigg, Honor Blackman and Joanna Lumley has died aged 83.

Screenwriter Brian Clemens, who created shows including The Avengers, The New Avengers and The Professionals, died in a London hospital on Saturday, his son George said. 

Clemens started his working life in advertising before breaking into the film and TV industry, writing scripts for low-budget thrillers.

In 1961 he wrote the original pilot episode for The Avengers, the cult swinging sixties spy show which made stars out of its cast, including Patrick Macnee, Honor Blackman and Diana Rigg - who was cast by Clemens to replace original actress Blackman.

His company, The Avengers (Film and TV) Enterprises Ltd, then went on to create the New Avengers, which aired in 1976. 

Clemens said he had considered 'about 700 girls' before selecting Joanna Lumley to play Purdey, a spy working for British intelligence.

The following year he launched The Professionals, which was famed for its Ford Capris, tight trousers, and 1970s rule-free approach to policing.

The show made stars of Martin Shaw and Lewis Collins, who died in November 2013, and was based around the adventures of a fictional crime fighting unit called CI5, which had been instructed by the Home Secretary to use any means necessary to deal with serious crime.

Other shows Clemens worked on included Danger Man, Adam Adamant Lives! and The Persuaders, as well as Bergerac and Perry Mason.

He also worked on a succession of Hammer horror films and was working with his two sons, George and Samuel on another horror film until his death.

Croydon-born Clemens was made an OBE for services to drama in 2010, and was married twice. He is survived by second wife Janet, and his two sons.

Samuel Clemens told the BBC the last thing his father did before he died was watch an episode of The Avengers.

'His last words were: I did quite a good job,' he said.

Clemens's company, Avengers Mark One Productions, produced The Professionals, which starred Martin Shaw, Gordon Jackson and Lewis Collins, who died in November 2013
