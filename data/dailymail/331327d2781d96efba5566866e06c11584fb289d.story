The upstate New York school bus monitor who was bullied by four seventh-graders says she is planning to retire.

Karen Klein, a 68-year-old grandmother, told The Associated Press that the decision to leave the job she held for three years was tough but wasn't based on her now infamous encounter with the mean-spirited seventh-graders, who tormented her with profanity, insults and threats during a bus run as the school year wound down in June.

A 10-minute video of the episode went viral and spurred an outpouring of more than $700,000 in donations for Klein from all over the world.

Retiring: Bus monitor Karen Klein, who was cruelly bullied by four seventh-graders,  says she is planning to retire

'I'm not quitting because of what 
happened. That's not it,' Klein said from her home in the Rochester 
suburb of Greece. 'I enjoyed working with the kids. But I guess it's my 
time to leave. That's what I've decided.'

Although her mind is made up, she said she has yet to submit the paperwork that would make her retirement official.

She said she'll keep busy in her 
retirement, perhaps volunteering with organizations that help people 
touched by bullying or suicide.

Klein's oldest son killed himself 10 
years ago, making all the more appalling one of the students' taunts: 
'You don't have a family because they all killed themselves because they
 don't want to be near you.'

The cellphone video, posted online, 
shows Klein trying her best to ignore the abuse. The Greece school 
district has suspended the four students for a year.

A Toronto man, Max Sidorov, was so 
moved by Klein's story that he started an online campaign with the goal 
of raising $5,000 to send her on a vacation.

The fundraising site Indiegogo listed 
the total amount raised at $703,833. A spokeswoman for the site said 
more than 30,000 people contributed, with donations coming in from at 
least 84 countries and all 50 U.S. states.

What the four boys did was captured on
 video, mercilessly taunting Klein as she sat on the bus, gradually 
breaking down in tears.

Last month, the school system in the 
Rochester suburb of Greece suspended the four middle school students for
 a year, keeping them from regular bus transportation.

How does Klein feel about this punishment?

"It's fine with me," she told the AP.

Klein said they'll still be going to an alternative school - "they won't be just sitting at home doing nothing."

But the best part of her ordeal going 
public, and the resulting school action, "is that they have to do 
community service - for senior citizens," she said, her voice rising 
with emotion.

Tormented: Klein, 68, was taunted and 
tormented by the middle school students in Greece, New York in a 
difficult-to-watch 10-minute video. She can be seen wiping away her tears in the footage

Unacceptable: At one point, a student says: 'If I
 stabbed you in the stomach, my knife would f***** go through like 
butter, because itâ€™s all f***** lard'

Klein, who is hard of hearing, spoke 
by telephone with the help of her adult son and daughter, who repeated 
questions that she then answered herself.

Another benefit of the video of the 
incident going viral, she said, "is that it's putting people into 
action, making them talk to their children, making them teach them what 
they should not do."

The cellphone video posted online by a
 fellow student drew millions of viewers. The video shows Klein trying 
her best to ignore a stream of profanity, insults and outright threats.

Painful memories: Speaking from her home in July, Klein said how hurt she was by the boys' vile words
