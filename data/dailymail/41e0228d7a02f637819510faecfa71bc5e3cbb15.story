 Xherdan Shaqiri is confident he has made the right decision to join Inter Milan after turning down offers to join the Barclays Premier League in the January transfer window.

The Switzerland international joined Inter from Bayern Munich last week and has signed a contract that will keep him at San Siro until June 2019.

The 23-year-old midfielder had been strongly linked with a move to England, where Everton, Liverpool and Stoke were reportedly keen to acquire his services.

Inter unveiled Shaqiri on Wednesday and he told the Italian press: 'I had offers from England and Germany but my wish was to join Inter.

'Juventus was also an option but I wanted Inter.

'I spoke to (Inter coach Roberto) Mancini on the phone and he explained the project to me and it really had an impact.

'The choice was very clear. Moreover, the idea to play in a new league fascinated me.'

Shaqiri joined Bayern from Basle in 2012 and won two Bundesliga medals and the 2013 Champions League with the German club, but he struggled to establish himself in the first team.

'I wan't totally happy at Bayern,' he said. 'I didn't have much playing time.

'But I've learned a lot at Bayern and I will try to make the most of my time at Inter. I need to play consistently in order to prove how much I'm worth.

'I am hungry for success. I can't wait to get started.

'I want to help Inter return to be at the top in Italy and in Europe. I hope that with this jersey I can return to win titles.'

Shaqiri could make his Inter debut on Saturday when Inter face Empoli in Tuscany.

Inter, who are currently ninth in Serie A, are still alive in both the Coppa Italia and the Europa League, where they will face Celtic in last 32.
