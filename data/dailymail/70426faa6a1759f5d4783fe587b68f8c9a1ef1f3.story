Husband and father Curtis Powelson, 31, tragically fell to his death on Monday after plunging into an hidden sinkhole while out hunting deer close to his home.

The active duty Marine lived with his family in Fort Leonard Wood, a U.S. Army base in the Missouri Ozarks.

His wife called the police when
Powelson didn't return home from bow hunting on Monday evening.

A man now identified as Curtis S. Powelson, 31, was bow hunting in his backyard when he fell into this 70ft sinkhole that was covered in brush

He had 
called his wife at dusk to tell her that he was tracking a deer in his backyard and that he 
thought he had shot and wounded it. That was the last time she would ever 
hear her husband's voice.

According to KSPR, 20
policemen, firefighters and a few neighbors from the small community 
made up mostly of military families, spent several hours searching for 
Powelson, who trained Military Police officers at Fort Leonard Wood.

They eventually found the young marine early on Tuesday morning, dead at the bottom of a 70ft unmarked sinkhole.

Pulaski
County Sheriff, Ron Long told the station that during the search 
'several firefighters' and deputies came close to falling into the 
sinkhole before finding Powelson's body.

'I kind of use that term loosely because
I've seen sinkholes before and this was nothing like I've seen before,'
said Long.  'It was very cylindrical.'

Investigators believe the sinkhole opened
up during heavy rains last month but the hunter didn't see it in the 
dark because it was hidden. No one in the neighborhood seemed to know of its existence.

The tight knit community in south-central Missouri remained closed lipped about the Marine's sudden death. The U.S. Marine Corp have yet to release any information about Powelson.

Pulaski County Assistant Coroner Michael McCart ruled the death accidental. 

KY3 spoke to McCart and tracked down firefighters who rapelled down the 70ft pit to recover Powelson's body.

'That one is pretty deep for as new as it is,' said McCart. 'Some of the older ones I've seen, they're usually entrances into cave systems.'

The sinkhole was not part of a cave. Its walls were freshly caved in.

Just last month several families fleed in terror as a holiday villa at Summer Bay Resort in Clermont, Florida dramatically collapsed into 50ft-wide sinkhole near Disney World.

Long attributed the emergence of the large hole to rainstorms last month. Due to its size, the sinkhole will not be filled.

Plans are in place to properly mark off the area in and around the pit.

Pulaski County authorities say a south-central Missouri hunter died after he fell into a sinkhole while looking for a deer he believed he shot.
