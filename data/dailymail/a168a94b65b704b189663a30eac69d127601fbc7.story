This may have been a routine victory for Chelsea, but the playmaking ability of Cesc Fabregas was there for all at Stamford Bridge to see.

With his short-corner delivery for Eden Hazard’s goal, the Spain midfielder registered his 10th league assist of the season - more than any other Chelsea player since the start of last season.

For a man who looks so effortless in his play, it’s some achievement.

Of course, the former Arsenal man is aided by the surfeit of attacking players making probing runs in front of him – namely Willian, Hazard, Oscar and Diego Costa – but picking the right option must be easier said than done.

There wasn’t anything particularly flashy about Chelsea’s attacks against West Brom – most of them started with the visitors losing possession from a goal kick – but Fabregas played his role to perfection.

Nemanja Matic or one of the centre halves would win the aerial battle and immediately look for Fabregas, who was never too far away and usually unmarked.

Chelsea’s No 4 would then bring the ball forward and pick out one of the four forward players, whose movement completely befuddled West Brom’s rearguard all afternoon.

Simple, yet effective. But in truth, Fabregas makes eye-of-the-needle through balls and long-range deliveries look easy.

Despite spending much of his time at Barcelona wasted as a false nine, it’s clear Fabregas’s best position is a deep-lying playmaker, rarely even entering the opponent’s penalty area. His assist stats certainly back this up.

His total of 10 is three more than his nearest challenger, Swansea’s Gylfi Sigurdsson, and is half way to Thierry Henry’s record haul of 20 in the 2002/03 season.

With only 12 games gone, Fabregas looks well on his way to breaking his former Arsenal team-mate’s record. He could easily have moved a few notches closer if it weren’t for the heroics of West Brom keeper Ben Foster.

Towards the end of the first half, with the game essentially won, Fabregas’s creative instinct showed no sign of letting up. 

West Brom had retreated into ultra-defensive mode and with Hazard, Oscar and Costa all well-covered, the Spain midfielder found right back Branislav Ivanovic with a beautifully-weighted through ball.

The Serb squared the ball to fellow full back Cesar Azpilicueta, who had broken into the left of the box and clear of West Brom’s back line, but Foster flew at the feet of the left back to push the ball out for a corner.

It may not have amounted to a goal, but that particular move, which came after a series of inch-perfect long balls from Fabregas, illustrated his versatility perfectly.

It’s somewhat odd that the simple short-corner routine that preceded Hazard’s goal should be the one Fabregas pass that resulted in an assist for the Spaniard, after his numerous defence-splitting and cross-field balls – practically all of which found their intended target.

But while the 27-year-old is taking corners, getting a free run of midfield and finding his attacking team-mates with such regularity, he looks a shoo-in to topple Henry’s 11-year-old record.
