Keeping his options open: Vice President Joe Biden said that he hasn't decided about running for President in 2016

Vice President Biden hasn't given up on his dream as he said that 'in my heart' he feels that he could be a good president.

'I haven't made a decision to run and I haven't made a decision not to run,' he said in a post-State of the Union interview this morning on The Today Show.

'In the meantime, I've got a job.'

He laughed and thanked anchor Savannah Guthrie for not asking outright if he was running, but she rephrased the question, making it more about his feelings.

'In my heart I'm confident I could 
make a good President. It's a very different decision to decide whether 
or not to run for President, and there's plenty of time for that.

In another stop on the morning show circuit, Biden said that he and his wife have not had any final conversations on the issue.

'Jill and I will make that decision later down the road,' he told CBS This Morning.

'If
 I do the job well and decide to run for President, it will help, If I 
don't the job well and decide to run for President, it won't help and if
 I don't run for President we'll be okay.'

When asked if Hillary Clinton's decision whether or not to run will play into his, Biden said: 'No not directly.'

'The
 only reason a man or woman should run for President- I'm sure Hillary 
views it the exact same way- is if they think they're better positioned 
to do what the nation needs at the moment.'

He echoed that sentiment during his ABC interview on Good Morning America:
 'If I run it won't be who's in the field, it'll be whether or not I 
honestly believe I have a chance to be able to really move this country 
in a direction that is different from those who are running.'

While
 Vice Presidents are typically the assumed candidate to lead a party at 
the end of a second term, many in the Democratic party see former 
Secretary of State Clinton as the likely nominee.

Off topic: The majority of the interviews were dedicated to discussing the State of the Union address given last night, but he also touched on former Secretary of Defense Bob Gates' memoir

Obama, Clinton and Biden were all presidential candidates in 2008, and Biden's numbers forced him to drop out more quickly than Clinton, who stayed in till the bitter end against Obama.

Though some thought that Clinton would make a good vice president for Obama in order to placate the warring factions of the Democratic party, tensions between the two were still so raw. Additionally, Biden was seen as a way to shore up Obama's international credibility given his time as the chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee.

Clinton's four years as the nation's top diplomat helped her check that box in President Obama's first term, and she now faces the challenge of overcoming the expectations allotted to a front-runner.

Political analysts also read into the 
fact that President Obama decided to sit down for his first televised 
interview of the second term with Clinton at his side rather than Biden.

In both interviews, which 
were done remotely from the library at the Naval Observatory in 
Washington, Biden made his first public remarks on former Secretary of 
Defense Bob Gates' memoir.

Gates
 blasted Biden in the book, saying that the vice President had been 
wrong on practically every issue throughout his decades in public 
office.

Next in line? Vice Presidents are typically the assumed successor after two terms, but many believe that Hillary Clinton is the most likely leader of the Democratic party in 2016

Judged on performance: Biden said that he has a job to do and if he does well, that would help a 2016 bid

Biden made a slip in his first remarks, as he twice called Gates' Bill instead of Bob, opting for the Microsoft billionaire's moniker instead of the Secretary of Defense.

'Look I like Bill Gates, the part I focused on in his book is he said "Biden's a man of great integrity". I think he's a man of integrity as well,' Biden said.

'The fundamental problem here is that Bill Gates and I- Bob Gates and I have disagreed on almost every major foreign policy issue since Vietnam.'
