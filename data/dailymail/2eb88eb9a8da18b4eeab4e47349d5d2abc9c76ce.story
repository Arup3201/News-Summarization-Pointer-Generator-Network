A New York University psychology professor has caused outrage among the academic community after he posted a message on Twitter suggesting that obese PhD students are not capable of completing the program.

Geoffrey Miller, who specializes in evolutionary psychology, tweeted on Sunday: 'Dear obese PhD applicants: If you don't 
have the willpower to stop eating carbs, you won't have the willpower to
 do a dissertation. #truth.'

Professor Miller, who is visiting NYU from the University of New Mexico, quickly deleted the message after a backlash from students and professors alike.

Academic slip-up: Visiting NYU professor Geoffrey Miller caused outrage when he tweeted this message last month

Crass: The professor, who has tenure at the University of New Mexico, quickly apologized for his remarks

Jay Rosen, who teaches journalism at the New York school, wrote: 'Astonishing fat-shaming tweet, since deleted, from an academic, @matingmind. The mind boggles.'

Professor Miller's transgression, highlighted by nymag.com, brought into question the academic's impartiality when it came to picking students for highly competitive PhD programs.

Dr Jason DeCaro, a former PhD student who is now a biological anthropologist in Alabama, tweeted: 'Dear rejected UNM psychology applicants: save now-deleted tweet for potential lawsuit. Jerk.'

Miller posted a hasty apology: 'My sincere apologies to all for that idiotic, impulsive, and badly judged tweet. It does not reflect my true views, values, or standards.'

It was quickly followed by the 
remark: 'Obviously my previous tweet does not represent the selection 
policies of any university, or my own selection.'

MailOnline was awaiting a response from Professor Miller as to what criteria he uses to select PhD students.

Miller, who is a tenured professor at the University of New Mexico, has joined NYU's Stern School of Business for eight months until this August.

He has been published in a wide range of international academic publications and conducted research at the London School of Economics, the Max Planck Institute for Psychological Research in Munich, Germany and UCLA.

All apologies: The academic quickly retracted his offensive remark on June 2
