A gun-wielding wife saved her football youth league football coach as he was attacked by a gang following a row with a father over his son's practice time.   

The incident occurred at about 7:45 p.m. Monday at Linwood Park in south Wichita.

The 37-year-old coach was confronted by a man who was angered by what he perceived as his son's lack of time on the field.

The incident occurred at about 7:45 p.m. Monday at Linwood Park in south Wichita (pictured) 

The father showed off his handgun before five or six other men - including one with a knuckleduster began attacking the coach, reports The Wichita Eagle. 

Seeing the attack, the coach's wife pulled out a gun and fired it into the air.

At this point, according to Lt. James Espinoza, the coach managed to escape and ran to his car to get another gun.  

His assailants fled before officers arrived and confiscated both guns  

Espinoza appealed for anyone with video footage of the incident to contact police.

He also expressed concern that children at the practice saw the attack. 

'They'll probably never forget that,' Espinoza said.

'It should be no part of the sport.'

No one was seriously hurt and no arrests were made.
