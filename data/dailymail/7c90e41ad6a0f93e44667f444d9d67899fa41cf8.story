'All I wanted was an easy life': Robert Moffat said he wished he had never won the lottery after he avoided prison for drink driving at a court hearing in Falkirk today

A lottery winner who blew all his money said today he wished he had never won the prize as he revealed he was now too poor even to pay a court fine for drink-driving.

Robert Moffat - one of Scotland's first big winners - escaped a jail term after being caught more than five times the legal limit behind the wheel of his father's car.

Moffat scooped £800,000 in 1996 - his share of a bumper £3.5million win divided among family members - but Falkirk Sheriff Court heard he now lives on benefits and can't afford to pay any financial penalty.

After being ordered to carry out 200 hours unpaid work, and being banned from the road for five years, Moffat said he wished he had never won the money.

The former barman, 51, said outside court: 'I had a much easier life before this happened. It was much less stressful.

'I just had a normal life, and had worked in the pub trade for over 19 years, just working away.

'After my win, everyone was chasing me for money, even the banks. There was obviously the high-profile paternity test as well.

'If I could go back to my life I would. I wish I'd never won this to be honest. All I wanted was an easy life.'

When asked what he had spent the money on, he said: 'Houses, cars, holidays and diamonds.

'I lived a good life for a while but £800,000 isn't a great deal when you spread it over 10 or so years.

'I just whittled it away, bit by bit. I had a pub in Denny, but I lost it two years ago, and have been unemployed since.

'It's been really difficult. All I really want is just a job. Any job really. I just want to get working again.'

He said there was no in-fighting with the family members with who  he shared the winnings -his father Tom, his brother Jim, 56, and sister Anne, 59.

He added: 'We don't discuss the money much. I don't know how much the rest of them still have.

'We keep ourselves to ourselves, but we get on when we see each other.'

The former barman, who was happily married before the win, with a daughter, had surrounded himself with the trappings of wealth - a Range Rover stood in the driveway of his luxury bungalow while a lovingly-restored classic Triumph sports car gleamed in the garage.

Both had personal registration plates.

However, the court heard he had lost it all, including his wife, Michelle.

Mark Keane, prosecuting, said that a member of the public phoned the police at 5pm on December 30 last year, after seeing a car which had crashed into a pavement bollard at Northfield Rd, Denny.

The driver was confirmed as Moffat - at the wheel of his father's X-type Jaguar.

Mr Keane said: 'As he approached the locus, he lost control, striking a bollard on the pavement. As a result, the front of the car was damaged.

'The member of the public saw the car with the engine still running. The sole occupant of the car got out and walked off up the road.'

He added: 'The witness was of the opinion that the driver was under the influence of alcohol and he reported the matter to police.'

Moffat was traced and taken to a police station where he admitted it was his father's car and apologised.

Moffat, of Braes View, Denny, Stirlingshire, admitted driving with an alcohol count of 186 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath. The limit is 35.

His pleas of not guilty to two further charges - failing to give information to the police as to who was the driver, and failing to cooperate with a preliminary breath test - were accepted by the Crown.

Defence solicitor Dick Sandeman said: 'Mr Moffat has had a particularly hard time over the past year or so.

'He lost everything he had in his business and his wife and he split up.

'He has a drink difficulty.'

Sheriff Thomas McCartney said only Moffat's lack of recent offending made him decide against a jail term.

He said: 'That someone should drive a car with such a high level of alcohol is absolutely outrageous.'

After Moffat won the Lottery a  former girlfriend claimed that he was the father of her son from a short-lived affair.

He found himself in court defending a bitter paternity action, but the case was thrown out when DNA tests proved Moffat could not be the boy's father.

Speaking at the time Moffat said: 'It's not pleasant being in the papers all the time just because people are jealous of my money and my nice cars.'

Mr Moffat Snr also had post lottery problems.

He married Emily Mitchell, who was 24 years his junior, and the pair ended up in the divorce courts after it was claimed he could not afford a £90,000 settlement because he had given away so much of his winnings to family, charity - and spent a lot on her during the marriage.

The retired metal worker, whose first wife died in 1989, and Emily eventually came to an amicable agreement.
