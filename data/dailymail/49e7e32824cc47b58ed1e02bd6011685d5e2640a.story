Do you know someone inspirational? The search for the 2013 winner is on

The Daily Mail is proud to be running the seventh Inspirational Women of the Year Awards, in association with British Gas and homelessness charity Shelter.

Over the next weeks, we want you to nominate special women who deserve recognition. Here, AMANDA CABLE tells the story of one remarkable nominee.

Her night had ended triumphantly and she went to sleep happy. Yet again, singer Erin McNeill, 18, had given a wonderful performance on stage. Today, she still has vivid memories of that evening - the adrenaline, the applause, her dreams of a career as a recording artist.

Sadly, those dreams were not to be. As she drifted off to sleep on Valentine's Day, 2009, fire swept through the friend's house where Erin - poised to sign her first record contract - was sleeping.

The blaze, probably caused by a pot left on the stove, reached a temperature of 600 degrees. When Erin was rescued by firefighters her life hung in the balance.

She suffered third degree burns to 45 per cent of her body. Her right arm had fourth-degree burns, meaning the damage was so severe it reached her muscles.

Lucky to be alive: Erin suffered third degrees burns after fire swept through a house as she slept

The schoolgirl's parents, roofing company manager Edward and school patrol supervisor Jean, both now aged 63, arrived at the local hospital in the early hours, to be told their youngest child was unlikely to survive.

Erin, now 23, says: 'When my mum saw me, she couldn't even recognise me. My body had swollen so much as a result of the burns, I had gone from a size eight to a size 22. I was covered in wires and tubes, and the doctors told her to gather other family members to say goodbye.'

She was transferred to a specialist burns unit at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, but infection set in and she suffered five cardiac arrests. Her life was only saved by a £60,000 specialist 'shark' skin treatment, that uses shark cartilage to replace lost skin and prevent skin moisture loss and infection.

When she woke from a medically induced coma seven weeks later, Erin was confronted by the devastating extent of her injuries.

Dark times: At first, the teen felt sorry for herself and wished nurses and fire fighters hadn't saved her

'I tried to speak, but couldn't make a sound as my vocal cords had been damaged. I tried to raise my hand, but my arms wouldn't move. I couldn't feel my legs and remember thinking "I've lost all my limbs",' says Erin.

'A single tear ran down my face, but I couldn't move to wipe it away.' When she finally managed to raise her arm weeks later, her hand was, as she describes it, 'a twisted claw'.

As Erin spent months in hospital having painful skin grafts, the effect her injuries would have on her life hit home.

'I'd gone from a rather selfish but totally independent teenager to a shuffling ghost, who needed to learn how to walk, talk and hold a spoon,' she says.

'Other people had to help bathe me and feed me. I lost every shred of my dignity. One day, I lost my temper too - and turned on a nurse. I remember angrily croaking "Why didn't you just let me die? You've turned me into a toddler again".

Support: She now helps other burns victims through their ordeal

'She walked away. I later found out she was used to such anger from frustrated patients.

'I felt terribly sorry for myself, and my family. I thought of everything I had lost. I had sung all my life. Now, my vocal chords were so damaged I could only whisper short sentences. It seemed so cruel.'

Erin learned to talk, feed and dress herself again, returning to the house in Menstrie, Scotland, she shared with friends in time for her 19th birthday in August 2009, six months after the fire.

'My relatives all came, but it was agony seeing them. My cousin wore a glittery pair of high heels. I was upset as I knew I wouldn't be able to wear high heels again because of the damage to my legs. I couldn't even wear make-up because my arms weren't strong enough to apply it. My birthday was the one day I wanted to be dressed up and made-up and happy, but I couldn't.'

'I told the children what happened to me, and said none of us should discriminate against anyone who looks different'

But over the weeks, Erin slowly began to realise how lucky she was to be alive. She thought about what she had left: her life, a family who loved her, loyal friends. She also thought of the firemen, who'd braved the inferno to save her.

'I went to thank the firefighters and the man, in his early 40s, who had carried me out of the fire was clearly quite traumatised by the events that night,' she says.

'He had found me unconscious, making the sound firemen call a “death gurgle” - which meant I was within ten seconds of dying. He relived this day in day out, and it shocked me from my torpor. I decided to dedicate my life to the firefighters who saved me.

'Soldiers who go to the frontline quite rightly have charities to support them. Firefighters face death and trauma every day, and yet there is little to help them.'

Erin vowed to raise money for firefighters, despite the appalling aftermath of her injuries and her 15 operations since the fire.

At the time she talked in a whisper, couldn't walk well and had weeping burns that made dressing agony. Nerve damage left her fingers clawed and she could not even pick up a cup of tea. Shock had made her hair fall out.

Confident: Erin has won beauty pageants

Despite this, on the anniversary of the fire Erin held a Valentine's Day Gala, which netted £9,000 for the local fire service.

She has since raised a total of £90,000 for causes, including the Glasgow Royal Infirmary burns unit and a local hospice.

Brave Erin recently ran 5km to raise money for the British Red Cross.

'It was agony because of my muscle weakness, but worth every step,' she recalls.

Erin is also working with the fire service, visiting schools.

'I would sit beside the fire safety officer with my cardigan on,' she says. 'Then, I would take the cardigan off to show my scars. I told the children what happened to me, and said none of us should discriminate against anyone who looks different.

'One day, a little boy said "My brother is disabled and I don't like it when people point and laugh. But if you can face everyone, I know that I can too".

'A girl did die in the fire that night - the old me - and it made me stronger and better'

'The teacher told me later he had never been able to discuss his brother before. "You've changed his life today," she said.'

Erin also mentors young burns survivors in hospital. She says: 'One, Kyle, suffered 80 per cent burns in a gas explosion and was refusing to take his medicine. He was 18, and felt his life was over. I marched in and said bluntly "If you want to get out of this hospital, take that medicine".

'I was another young person, so he listened. When he left hospital, I cared for him at home for a week to give his mother a break.

'I was exhausted by caring for him, but felt so lucky. The fire had changed me from a selfish teenager to someone who really understood the meaning of love.'

While struggling to come to terms with the scaring, Erin also began to enter beauty pageants.

'I wanted to show beauty is something on the inside too, and scars don't take away a person’s beauty or dignity,' she explains.

Brave: Burns victim Erin has dedicated her life to volunteering

'Last November I won the United Nations International Pageant in Jamaica. I stood on the podium, baring my scars, and thought "I hope there's someone out there who will see scars don't take away your life".'

After her win, Erin was abused by online trolls. One even phoned to tell her: 'You deserve to die'.

'A girl did die in the fire that night - the old me - and it made me stronger and better,' she says.

In 2012, Erin won the British Red Cross Humanitarian Citizen Award for her volunteering.

She now has a boyfriend Thomas, 20, a car valet. On their first date, her arms covered, she asked him to Google her to see her scars. 'I could tell instantly he was going to be OK with it. He sees me - not my burns,' says Erin.

At night, Erin has a recurring dream: 'I'm belting out a Mariah Carey classic on stage in Las Vegas. Then I wake - and remember that I'll never sing again.'

The rich alto-soprano voice may be gone forever. But in its place is a young woman of remarkable courage and determination.
