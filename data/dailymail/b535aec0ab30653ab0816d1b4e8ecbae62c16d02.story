The brother of an unarmed biracial teenager who was shot dead when he allegedly assaulted a police officer delivered a heartfelt and moving eulogy remembering his brother on Saturday. 

Jordan Robinson, the brother of Tony Robinsoin, stood up in front of hundreds of mourners in Madison, Wisconsin as he said; 'Terrell was the best brother you could ever have. Terrell will always live on in our hearts.'

Jordan broke down at one point as he spoke of his brother and was comforted by their sobbing mother. 

Tony, whose mother is white and father black, died on Friday March 6 after what police say was a confrontation in which he assaulted Matt Kenny, who retaliated with gunfire.

A preliminary autopsy showed Robinson was shot in his head, torso and right arm. The autopsy did not say whether he was facing or turned away from Kenny.

'Terrell was a passionate and compassionate young man and a wonderful friend,' the program read according to The Capital Times. 

'He leaves with us all an unmatched sense of pride and a wealth of love and memories.'

Sharon Irwin, Tony’s grandmother, also delivered an emotional and touching speech.

'We are family. We stand for what he stood for. We stand for peace, we stand for change. He was young, he was black and he is beautiful,' she said.,

'I know my grandson was on a spiritual path. The last thing he said to me was, "I think I got it figured out and I’m going to take on my responsibility."'

She then asked that the Phil Collins' song In the Air be played as the entire congregation rose out of their seats. 

Prior to the service, the John Legend and Common song Glory played as photos of Tony from his birth up through high school flashed on screens.

'I was told many times this would be the hardest words of comfort I would ever have to offer anyone,' said Rev. David Hart III, who officiated the service.

'Too many of our children are dying before their time … we watched Trayvon die before his time, we watched Michael Brown die before his time. We desperately want to change that narrative.'

Marching: Around 1,500 attended the Wednesday march through Madison

Robinson's death was the latest in a string of shootings by police nationwide that have heightened racial tensions.

Some protests turned violent in Ferguson, Missouri after an unarmed black man was fatally shot last August, and this week two policemen were injured from gunfire during a demonstration in front of the Ferguson Police Department.

Killer: Matt Kenny was the police officer from Madison, Wisconsin, who shot Robinson

Protests have been peaceful in Madison, where blacks make up around 7 percent of the 240,000 population.

The shooting has highlighted local concerns, prompting open letters from nearly 90 religious leaders and many local politicians calling for action to bridge racial inequality.

Demonstrators on Wednesday marched to the home of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a likely Republican presidential candidate.

On his gate they posted on the gate a list of demands including an end to what they called unequal policing of poor, black neighborhoods and an increase in funding for public schools. Walker was not there at the time.

Madison police have been more conciliatory than their counterparts in Ferguson since the shooting. 

Police Chief Mike Koval rushed to the home of Robinson's family on the night of the killing and prayed with the man's grandmother in the driveway. He has emphasized the right of protesters to march peacefully.

Under a new Wisconsin law that requires an outside agency to look into fatal police shootings, a state agency has stepped in to investigate.
