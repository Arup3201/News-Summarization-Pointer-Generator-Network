A gambler who scooped more than $14million in five minutes on the slots is planning to donate his winnings to charity.

The Las Vegas man - who is choosing to remain anonymous - is not a regular at the Rampart Casino in Summerlin.

But on his lucky day, he decided to play Megabucks with his best friend who was visiting Sin City.

Jackpot: The casino tweeted this picture of a novelty check to announce the local's big win. A casino spokeswoman said he plans to donate some of his winnings to charity 

And it only took him a few minutes and $20 to win big - $14.3million in total, some of which he plans to use to give his local church a new home, NBC News reported.

Casino spokeswoman Jenifer Smith said he wants to fund a new building for his church, which has been holding services in a high school gymnasium.

General manager Michael Gaughan Jr. said: 'We pay large jackpots all time, just today we are paying $14million to a lucky local. 

'It doesn't get better than this.'
