Controversial: Francesca Minerva says doctors should have the right to kill newborn babies because they are disabled, too expensive or simply unwanted by their mothers

An academic with links to Oxford University has received death threats after claiming that killing newborn babies is no different to aborting them because they are not ‘actual persons’.

Dr Francesca Minerva said that the days since her paper was published in a medical journal have been ‘the worst in my life.’ She said she has received a series of hate messages claiming she would ‘burn in hell’.

In her paper in the British Medical Journal, Dr Minerva, who is based at the University of Melbourne but is also a research associate at Oxford, suggested that killing newborn babies was no different from abortion.

The article, titled ‘After-birth abortion: Why should the baby live?’ was written by her and Alberto Giubilini of the University of Milan.

The paper suggests newborn babies are not ‘actual persons’ and do not have a ‘moral right to life’ because they ‘lack those properties that justify the attribution of a right to live of an individual.’

After receiving death threats and angry messages, she asked for people to understand the perspective of her work.

‘This is not a political paper - this is not a proposal for law,’ she told the website ninemsn.

‘This is pure academic, theoretical discussion.’

In her article she says that ‘both a foetus and a newborn certainly are human beings and potential persons, but neither is a “person” in the sense of a “subject of a moral right to life.”’

She adds: ‘We take “person” to mean an individual who is capable of attributing to her own existence some (at least) basic value such that being deprived of this existence represents a loss to her.’

Dr Minerva and her research colleague continue: ‘What we call “after-birth abortion” (killing a newborn) should be 
permissible in all the cases where abortion is, including cases where 
the newborn is not disabled.'

Right to decide: Dr Minerva argues a young baby is not a real person and so killing it in the first days after birth is little different to aborting it in the womb

As the hate calls came in, Dr Minerva told the website that she had not been expecting the overwhelmingly negative reaction. She said she believes her argument was taken out of its academic and theoretical context.

‘I wish I could explain to people it is not a policy, and I’m not suggesting that and I’m not encouraging that’.

She believes the majority of threats have come from religious or Pro-Life groups.

Some of the hate messages told her that she would be punished by God, while others suggested she should ‘burn in hell’.

Professor Julian Savulescue, editor of the journal, said arguments about killing newborns were ‘largely not new’.

He said the goal of the journal was to ‘present well-reasoned argument based on widely accepted premises.’

Joanna Jepson: 'A compelling reason to stop late-term abortions'

Rev Joanna Jepson, an opponent of late abortions, said what the ethicists had proposed was little more than infanticide. 

The female vicar first came to public attention when she spoke out against a late abortion that had been carried out in 2001.

Doctors
 are permitted to carry out abortions beyond the 24-week legal limit if 
they believe a baby's disability is serious enough, but Joanna argued 
that a cleft palate was a minor physical flaw, not a severe abnormality.

She revealed that, 
until she had surgery at the age of 19, her own face was disfigured by a 
congenital defect. Her upper jaw overhung her lower jaw, which receded 
into her neck. She posed the question: 'Would it have been right to 
abort me?'

She said: 'It's 
misleading to call this 'after birth abortion'. The pregnancy is already
 over, there is nothing to abort. What is being discussed is 
infanticide.

'There is a 
logic to their point - if we consider it acceptable to abort a baby up 
until birth then why not allow it to die afterwards? It is just a 
difference in geography - within or outside the mother's body.

'Of
 course, I would see this a compelling reason to abolish late-term 
abortion, if infanticide is morally repulsive then abortion is too.

'If
 a baby, because of it's physical disabilities, is seen as being 
"incompatible with life" then we need to let life and death take its 
course. Becoming agents of death fundamentally changes doctor's role as 
healer and physician, and it also has massive repercussions on society's
 conscience shifting what is understood to be morally and socially 
unacceptable to become acceptable.

Of
 course motherhood is inconvenient, physically, emotionally, 
psychologically, financially - but this inconvenience is not allowed to 
become acceptable grounds for abandoning one's child.

'If
 a child or an adult has a life-changing accident or illness, do we 
suggest we'll put them down because their goals and dreams now have to 
change?

'My brother, 
Alastair, has great and huge goals and he goes after them with great 
courage.  His Downs Syndrome does not stand in the way.

'They
 are very different dreams and goals to my own but no less valuable or 
of contribution to society.  At what level would Dr Minerva assign 
somebody's meaning and value to be worth a life?

Mass grave: Yewden Villa in Buckinghamshire

While infanticide may seem an inhumane concept for many people, there have been periods in history where it has been accepted behaviour - and even a legal obligation.

In Roman culture, disabled infants were often abandoned after birth by parents who did not want or could not afford the financial burden.

The child would simply be left outside to die from starvation and the elements in a practice known as 'exposure'. It was an established and acceptable procedure.

In 1912, Yewsden Villa (right) was excavated in Hambleden in Buckinghamshire, and researchers were shocked to find the bodies of 97 babies in a mass-grave.

The babies had apparently all been killed shortly after birth, and the prevailing theory is that the site was near a brothel.

With a lack of contraception in Roman times, unwanted pregnancies would likely have been much more common, and the mass grave is another example that infanticide did not pose such an ethical dilemma in that era.

Archaeologists believe Romans did not consider infants to be 'full' human beings until about the age of two, and babies who died before that age were not buried in cemeteries, but instead in public or domestic areas.

However a Roman couple were entitled to raise a disabled child. In Sparta, there was little choice in the matter.

Newborns were seen as the property of the state and all babies were inspected by a community leader. If the child showed signs of deformity or ill-health, the parents were ordered to expose it.

Many parents in ancient Greeks would also expose their newborns because of sickness, financial pressure, or simply for being the 'wrong' sex in the male-dominated society.

Many religions had did not raise moral objects to infanticide, although Christianity and Islam notably rejected it.

Leaving the child to the elements was the preferred method to 'dispose' of the child, because it meant the child died of natural causes, which was a more 'moral' death than directly killing the child.

The practice generally died out, and was outlawed in the last years of the Roman Empire. However there are references to infanticide in many cultures in every historical era, and is believed to still take place in certain parts of India, Africa, and China.

China's controversial 'one-child' policy leads to many children being abandoned after birth.

Trevor
 Stammers, a lecturer in medical ethics and former chairman of the 
Christian Medical Fellowship, described the viewpoint as ‘chilling’.

Gill
 Duval, of the ProLife Alliance, said every life is precious and added: 
‘Everybody talks about what women want but women wouldn’t want this.’

Lord Alton, chairman of the All Party
 Parliamentary Group on Pro-Life, told the Catholic Herald: ‘It is 
profoundly disturbing, indeed shocking, to see the way in which 
opinion-formers within the medical profession have ditched the 
professional belief of the healer to uphold the sanctity of human life 
for this impoverished and inhumane defence of child destruction.’

Julian Savulescu, the journal’s editor, said that the article’s argument has been made before by eminent figures.

He added: ‘I’m not defending practising infanticide. I’m defending academic and intellectual freedom.’

He said that Dr Minerva has a ‘loose relationship’ with Oxford and her main position is at the University of Melbourne.
