A British man has told how typhoon Haiyan destroyed his tent just weeks after an earthquake wrecked the home he built.

David Carter, 69, who lives  in the Philippines with his Filipino wife Lydia and their three adopted children, lost the emergency tent they were living in when the typhoon ravaged his home town.

Speaking of his 'terrifying' ordeal, he said that the community looked like a 
'nightmare scene that even Hollywood couldn't create' since the disaster struck eight days ago.

Devastated: David Carter, and his wife Lydia lost their home in the Philippines two natural disasters, first an earthquake in October and now typhoon Haiyan

But that was the second disaster to strike Mr Carter and his family, whose three-bedroom house was destroyed when a 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck his town, Loon, on Bohol Island on October 15.

Mr Carter, a former property developer, had built his house from scratch around 17 years ago.

'We never expected anything like this to ever happen,' he said.

'I was just in the house when the earthquake hit and I just shouted to my children to get out just in time before the house fell.'

Mr Carter, from Burnley, Lancashire, spent most of his career in England with Lydia before the pair moved to the country permanently 20 years ago.

Community shattered: Police officers carry a body from a wiped out village near Tacloban City, Leyte

Run aground: Survivors walks past two ships that ran ashore in Tacloban City in the chaos unleashed by Typhoon Haiyan

He said: 'About two thirds of it has been destroyed but in comparison to some of the other buildings it did quite well.

'Then when the high winds hit last Friday my wife and I just held hands in our tent and prayed that it would pass.

'Now Loon looks completely unrecognisable, the whole population are desperately short of supplies and the whole island is without power.

'The only way aid can get through is by helicopter or by making a five hour dangerous journey through the mountains where there are a lot of landslides.'

Yet despite his situation Mr Carter is determined to stay put.

He said: 'Loon is my home and there is nothing that would make me leave it or the people here.

‘I intend to completely rebuild my house and will not give up until it's completely restored, however long it may take.'

The search for missing Brit Colin Bembridge, 61, from Grimsby, continues.

Mr Bembridge was staying in the coastal village of Baybay visiting his 35-year-old Filipino girlfriend Maybelle and their three-year-old daughter Victoria.

The mother of Mr Bembridge's partner, 79-year-old Lydia, showed the programme the wreckage of the beach house where her daughter and granddaughter had been staying.

She said: 'I am at a loss of where they are. My heart, it's hurting.'

He is one of a number of British nationals who remain unaccounted for following the typhoon.

A Foreign Office spokesman said William Hague phoned the Philippines Secretary for Foreign Affairs Albert Ferreros Del Rosario this afternoon to offer his condolences.

'The Foreign Secretary confirmed that a number of British nationals remained unaccounted for,' he added.

'He asked that every possible assistance be given to any British people caught up in the disaster.'

Sending help: US sailors from the aircraft carrier USS George Washington, as well as French humanitarian volunteers, load relief supplies for villagers isolated by Haiyan at Tacloban airport

Coming together: Aid is unloaded from a military plane at Tacloban city airport, from where it will be distributed to the affected towns and villages

Meanwhile, the first food and medical aid has begun to reach isolated towns in the island nation as both the UK and the U.S. pledge further help.

Donations by the British public to charity appeal in support for the victims has reached an impressive £33million as an RAF plane 
carrying heavy duty vehicles and emergency medical supplies arrived in 
the Philippines as part of the UK's emergency response to the disaster.

The
huge C-17 transport plane touched down in Cebu province to deliver two 
JCB diggers, two Land Rovers and a forklift truck shortly after 8am 
after leaving RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire yesterday morning.

A 12-strong team of British doctors, 
surgeons and paramedics are already in the devastated Asian country 
helping to treat survivors of the typhoon.

The unprecedented ferocity of Super Typhoon Haiyan on November 8 and the scale of destruction it caused completely overwhelmed the initial relief effort, leaving millions in the worst-hit central islands of Leyte and Samar hurt, homeless and hungry, with no power or water.

Eight days after Haiyan, a working aid pipeline was in place on the ground, funnelling emergency supplies to those left destitute in the ruins of Tacloban city, on Leyte, one of the worst hit central islands, while helicopters flying off the aircraft carrier USS George Washington brought some relief to outlying areas.

The Red Cross and Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) said they would have mobile surgical units up and running in Tacloban by the end of the weekend.

'The place really needs to be saturated with relief,' Red Cross Asia-Pacific spokesman Patrick Fuller said in Tacloban.

'People literally have nothing. Money is useless here.'

Human cost of the tragedy: The death toll has passed 3,000 and survivors cover their noses as they pass bodybags along the streets in Tacloban City

Since the arrival of the USS George Washington late Thursday, the U.S. military said it had delivered 118 tonnes of food, water and shelter items to Tacloban and elsewhere, and airlifted nearly 2,900 people to safety.

Japan confirmed it would send almost 1,200 troops to join relief efforts along with three warships, 10 planes and six helicopters - its military's single largest aid deployment.

Earlier, David Cameron announced the Government is to give an extra £30million in aid, bringing the total amount to £50million.

Speaking at a press conference in Sri Lanka ahead of the Commonwealth summit, the Prime Minister said the scale of the disaster is 'becoming clearer every day'.

Five UK Government flights have now delivered aid packages and at least seven more are planned to leave. These have so far delivered 14,988 shelter kits, 17,369 tarpaulins, 11,230 hygiene kits, 5,925 jerry cans and nine 4x4s.

Mr Cameron said: 'Today, I can announce we are providing another £30million to support the UN and the Red Cross emergency appeals and we are also supplying an RAF C-130 Hercules aircraft to help ensure aid workers can move between the worst affected areas and get aid to those who need it.

'A week after Typhoon Haiyan hit, the scale of the disaster is becoming clearer every day - over 3,600 dead, nearly 12 million affected.

'They are going to need sustained help from the international community as they start to rebuild their lives.

'I'm proud of the fact that the UK has taken the lead in international relief with rapid response of warships, aircraft and equipment.'

Helping hands: Walking through the rubble, survivors form a line to receive relief goods at a devastated coastal area in Leyte, Philippines

Royal Navy aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious is also being sent to replace HMS Daring, which has already been deployed to the Philippines.

The latest death toll given by Mr Cameron is an increase of more than 1,000 on estimates made by the country's civil defence agency earlier this week.

But some officials estimate that the final toll, when the missing are declared dead and remote regions are reached, will be more than 10,000.

'We don't know how we'll start again,' said Benny Creer, 53, as he helped a relative sweep debris from his shattered home in Tacloban.

'In this situation, there are no poor, no rich - everyone is equal,' Creer said.

In Giporlos, a small coastal town of around 12,000 people in eastern Samar where the typhoon first struck, a US Seahawk helicopter flew in the first relief supplies Saturday, landing in the playground of a ruined elementary school.

'We're very happy even if it isn't really sufficient for us,' said resident Maria Elvie Depelco.

'We accept a little, and we survive. Because there's no more food, no houses here,' she said, pointing to the flattened remains of the town where 12 people died.
