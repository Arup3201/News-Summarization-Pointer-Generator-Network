The Help to Buy scheme could net the government £4.5billion because of a house price boom - even though the boom has partly been blamed on the scheme itself.

The Treasury is on track to receive a vast windfall because of a clause allowing it to share the cash from homes which are sold on at a profit.

Help to Buy hands buyers 20 per cent of a home's value - and when the house is sold with the loan still active, the government takes 20 per cent of any increase over the years.

Windfall: The government could make £4.5billion from the Help to Buy scheme, research has claimed

Because of the explosion in British house prices, the government will make a 59 per cent return on its loans over the scheme's lifetime, research by the Financial Times claimed today.

That means by 2020, when the scheme is due to end, the Treasury will have handed out enough loans to net itself £4.5billion.

Launched in March 2013 to help first-time buyers of new-build homes who could not afford a deposit

It aimed to kick-start housing market

Buyers stump up as little as 5% on a mortgage which carries a 25% deposit

Treasury loans the buyer the other 20%, interest-free for five years

If house is sold after rising in value, Treasury wins 20% of the difference

But if it has fallen in value, Treasury pays 20% of the difference instead

A second scheme, nicknamed Help to Buy 2, is also available and involves state guarantees on loans for any type of property - not just new builds

Neither can be used for interest-only mortgages or buy-to-lets

But the windfall is controversial because the recent surge in house prices has partially been blamed on the Help to Buy scheme itself.

Critics say it is inflating prices by encouraging more houses to be sold without new ones being built, which was the original aim of the scheme.

Local government committee chairman Clive Betts, who has attacked the scheme as 'dangerous', told the Financial Times: 'What would reassure people is if the government said they would take any profits and reinvest them in new homes, that would represent a substantial building programme.'

And he wrote previously: 'The very last thing we should be doing is fueling inflation in a still over-priced market and, thus, actually disabling even more families from becoming owner-occupiers.'

But the government has not said whether it will reinvest the money directly into building new homes.

A Treasury spokesman told the Financial Times it had 'a direct financial interest in the Help to Buy scheme and an increasing interest in the tax revenues generated from the housing market'.

The Financial Times arrived at its figures by assuming all houses bought under the scheme would be sold after five years.

It based the total on the £184,000 average selling price of homes so far, and the government's ambition to lend to 25,000 people a year.

Scheme could be triggering a house price boom making it even harder to get on the ladder in the first place

Many homes bought under the initial scheme would have been built anyway, meaning it is not boosting house-building as it was intended

Extending the scheme to include houses which are not new builds will not help boost the housebuilding industry

Middle-class parents could 'hijack' scheme to invest through their children

However, the profits will reach government coffers extremely slowly as they only become available when houses are sold.

And
 the scheme is not without its risks. The government takes 20 per cent 
of profits when a house rises in value - but also has to stump up 20 per
 cent of the loss if it falls.

Help to Buy loans are also interest-free for five years, which reduces the amount of money the government makes.

The scheme began last March and had a major test this week when figures were released for its first full financial year.

They showed the government loaned £791million to 19,394 buyers - less than the 25,000-a-year target.

Some areas of the country have benefited far more than others, according to analysis by MailOnline.

In many of the wealthiest London boroughs - including Kensington 
and Chelsea, Richmond, Haringey, Hammersmith and Fulham, Camden and 
Westminster - not a single Help to Buy loan appears to have been issued 
all year.

That contrasts sharply with Leeds, which with 337 was the council area with the most Help to Buy loans in the last year.

It was followed closely by Wiltshire with 316, Central Bedfordshire with 287 and Milton Keynes with 282.

The most Help to Buy loans per head, meanwhile, were given out in Corby - which had one loan for every 570 residents.

It was followed by Peterborough, South Norfolk, Gloucester and Aylesbury Vale.
