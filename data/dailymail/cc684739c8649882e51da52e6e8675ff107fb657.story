Cuts and bruises: Joanna Rowsell says she is 'ok' after being kncoked down by a car

Olympic gold medallist Joanna Rowsell became the latest cycling star to be hurt in a road crash yesterday.

The hero of London 2012 was a ‘little shaken’ but her injuries were not serious, said her agent. ‘She is at home taking it easy,’ she added.

Joanna, 24, who won team pursuit gold, was knocked down while road-race training in Manchester.

She tweeted: ‘I am OK, no serious injuries just cuts and bruises.’

The rider, who suffers alopecia, added: ‘First time for everything. Been a cyclist for nearly 9 yrs & never been knocked off by a car until this morning. Bike came off worst. Take care out there people.’

Along with her Olympic team-mates, Rowsell has now switched her focus to road racing as part of a new women's race team.

However, she is not competing with Trott and King in the current Energiewacht Tour in the Netherlands.

Joanna’s crash follows a series of incidents involving Britain’s cycling heroes.

Tour de France winner Sir Bradley Wiggins broke his ribs after being knocked down in Lancashire in November.

The Olympic medalist collided with a van outside a petrol station during a training ride and was rushed to hospital.

Less than 24 hours later, cycling head coach Shane Sutton suffered bleeding on the brain after an accident in Manchester.

Australian Sutton has worked 
with the GB Cycling team since 2002 and has been credited with playing a
major role in transforming the fortunes of the sport in this country.

He was awarded an OBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours list in 2010 for his services to sport.
Sutton's career began as a road and track cyclist where he won numerous 
titles including a Commonwealth Games gold medal in the 1978 team 
pursuit competition and the 1990 Milk Race.

He split his time between the track and the road in coaching this year's British competitors at the London Olympics.

In 2011 world road race champion Mark Cavendish was knocked off his bike in Italy.

A spokesperson for British Cycling said after the crashes involving Wiggins and Sutton: 'Cycling
is not an intrinsically dangerous activity but there is much more to be
done to improve conditions for cyclists on the roads.

'British
Cycling is calling on the government to put cycling at the heart of 
transport policy to ensure that cycle safety is built into the design of
all new roads, junctions and transport projects, rather than being an 
afterthought.'
