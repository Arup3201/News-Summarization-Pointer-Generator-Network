Archaeologists who are digging for the remains of the real-life Mona Lisa have found a female skeleton - but sadly they do not believe these are bones of Leonardo da Vinci's muse.

Researcher Silvano Vinceti, leading the digs under a former convent in central Florence, believes the body he has found is that of a woman who lived decades after Lisa Gherardini, the woman many experts believe sat for da Vinci's iconic painting.

So far the team - who have been criticised in some corners for their methodology - have discovered four remains under the convent.

The convent was the burial site of Lisa Gherardini, wife of the wealthy Florentine silk merchant Francesco del Giocondo, who modelled for Leonardo Da Vinci

Bodies were buried one on top of the other at the convent - so the team will keep digging, and reaching further back in history.

Vinceti told reporters: 'The ledgers 
kept by the nuns of this convent tell us that, presumably, the remains 
exhumed today are those of Maria Del Riccio, a wealthy woman who (died) 
in 1609.'

But he added that he hoped 'Mona Lisa's' bones 'could be right here'.

Lisa Gheradini, was the wife of a 
rich silk merchant named Francesco del Giocondo. In Italy the Mona Lisa 
is known as La Gioconda.

Most
modern historians agree that the lady depicted in the Mona Lisa was 
Lisa del Giocondo, who became a nun after her husband's death. She died 
in the convent on July 15, 1542, aged 63.

An archeological team began digging at the abandoned Convent of Saint Ursula last year.

They first had to dig through thick concrete, laid down ahead of plans to turn the convent into an army barracks.

If they do find the body of Lisa 
Gherardini, the team hopes to extract her DNA to confirm her identity - 
comparing it to the DNA of her two children buried elsewhere.

Then they will use facial reconstruction techniques to compare her face to that of the iconic painting.

However some researchers have 
criticised the research, saying the pace of the expedition means error 
may be made - such as the team not mapping out where bones and other 
items are found, ruining evidence such as the spatial relationships 
between different bodies.

LiveScience quoted University of North
Carolina anthropologist Kristina Killgrove, who said: 'Although the 
excavation is being carried out in a professional manner, Vinceti’s 
quest to dig up the "real" Mona Lisa is not grounded in scientific 
research methodology.

;The news media’s breathless coverage 
of it threatens to signal to the public that archaeologists are 
frivolous with their time, energy and research money.'
