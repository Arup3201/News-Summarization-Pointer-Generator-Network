A pick-up truck driver whose 'fast and mad' driving moments after sending a text message led to him hitting and killing a cyclist has been jailed.

Roofer Timothy John McLoughlin, 45, was on his way home from playing golf when he lost control and crashed his pick-up truck, hitting 55-year-old cyclist Graham Devlin.

McLoughlin had been speeding and tailgating other cars before trying to overtake between two traffic islands on November 17 last year.

Other drivers were incredulous at his 'fast and mad' driving that afternoon with one witness saying: 'Jesus Christ, look at this nutter.'

Panicking as he neared a bollard and oncoming traffic, McLoughlin cut in sharply and hit the driver's door of a van.

His truck flipped and careered across the road in Billingham, County Durham, 'at great speed and with great power', Teesside Crown Court heard.

The Mitsubishi L200 struck Mr Devlin, riding his bike to work in a high-visibility jacket and helmet, on a cyclepath set away from the wet 40mph road.

He was catapulted from his bike and died instantly.

McLoughlin had sent a short text message seconds before the accident  and there was an increased likelihood that this contributed to the crash, prosecutor Jo Kidd said yesterday.

The driver, who had drunk two pints of beer, was unconscious at the scene, suffered a punctured lung and stayed in hospital for three weeks.

Then he 'buried his head in the sand' and went on holiday to Egypt before going to speak to police. 

McLoughlin, of Stainton, Middlesbrough, admitted causing death by dangerous driving, saying in a statement: 'I fully accept responsibility for the wrong dangerous decision to overtake.' 

The driver said he remembered nothing after his van skidded and he was 'gobsmacked' to hear of the fatality two days later.

Apologising to Mr Devlin's family, he said he was 'constantly upset and saddened' for them.

He said: 'I know my sincerest apologies to his family cannot in any way undo the devastating loss I have caused the family.

'However I do wish to convey how deeply sorry I am for what I did.

'Also my actions have devastated my family.'

Judge Howard Crowson said: 'No sentence I can pass can assuage the grief or match the loss.

'The sentence I impose is not intended to place a value on the life of Mr Devlin. That life is priceless.'

He told McLoughlin his crime was persistent dangerous driving, killing a man who 'should have been entirely safe'.

McLoughlin was jailed for three years and nine months, banning him from driving for four years. 

In a statement read in Teesside Crown Court, wife Margaret Devlin opened her heart in a statement.

She said she loved Graham dearly, and the family's life was 'destroyed' by the news of his death.

Mrs Devlin said: 'In that split second I realised I had lost a husband of 23 years, my daughter Katie had lost her father and my sister-in-law had lost a brother.'

She added: 'Everyday life is very painful and less worthwhile without Graham being there to share it with. I have had to leave my job due to ill health and I am struggling to cope with day-to-day life. If there is a Hell, we are living it.'

She described her husband as a family man who 'worked to live' and enjoyed time with his friends, visiting the gun club, listening to music and playing bass guitar.

She said: 'Everything he did, he did safely and by the book.

'He had recently signed up to be a volunteer fireman and was so proud when he had passed the driving test which enabled him to drive the fire tenders.

'We are still all very bitter and angry that someone has taken a huge part of our life away.'

She said the family wanted Timothy McLoughlin to be 'severely punished to the full extent of the law'.

A statement given after the sentencing said: 'The family has been truly devastated by the loss of a wonderful husband and father who is greatly missed. It didn't matter what prison sentence that man received. It will never compensate for their loss.'

The family urged drivers to be aware of cyclists and remember their duty to drive responsibly.

Senior investigating officer PC Neil Foster said he hoped the sentence would bring some comfort, and reminded drivers of their obligation to 'keep others safe'.

How can I put into words what Graham meant to me and my family and the true impact of life without him?

On Sunday November 17, 2013 our lives were destroyed by the news that Graham, who had been cycling to work on the cycle path next to Haverton Hill Road, had been struck by a vehicle and had died at the scene.

In that split second I realised that I had lost a husband of 23 years, my daughter Katie had lost her father and my sister-in-law had lost a brother.

Five months later we are in no better shape and everyday life is very painful and less worthwhile without Graham being there to share it with.

I have had to leave my job due to ill health and I am struggling to cope with day-to-day life. I am trying to stay strong for my daughter but it is so hard. If there is a Hell, we are living it.

Graham was a family man. He worked to live and would spend his time, when not with his family, out with friends at the club or enjoying one of his many hobbies.

These included visiting the gun club, playing the bass guitar or just listening to his favourite music, loud. Graham was a joiner by trade but had recently gone to work as a security officer. Everything he did, he did safely and by the book.

When riding his bike he would always wear a helmet and the appropriate clothing, and ensure his bike was properly maintained with correctly fitted lights.

He had recently signed up to be a volunteer fireman and was so proud when he had passed the driving test which enabled him to drive the fire tenders.

He would frequently visit his sister Jane and do odd jobs around her house just to help.

Graham would often be in his front room and I would be in the TV room to the rear of our house.

Although we were in separate rooms doing different things, I still felt close to him and knew he would be there for me if I needed him.

I loved him dearly. In some ways Katie has been hit hardest by this tragedy. She misses her father so much and is in a continuous state of panic that something terrible is also going to happen to me.

She has to remain in constant contact with me to ensure that I am safe.

She hardly sleeps, eats and is struggling to maintain her job. Nightmares are frequent as are the panic attacks.

We are still all very bitter and angry that someone has taken a huge part of our life away.

We all agree that the person responsible for killing Graham did not intend to do so, but nevertheless it has occurred and we would like him to be severely punished to the full extent of the law.

This will not bring Graham back but it will show that the actions of one man can destroy the lives of so many and that this behaviour is not acceptable and will not be tolerated.
