The world's top golfers won't tee off there until Thursday.

But Prince Andrew was given an exclusive chance to test the Open course last week – after flying himself there by helicopter.

The keen golfer, who plays off a handicap of four, got some practice in at Royal Lytham & St Annes ahead of the prestigious tournament, which begins this week.

It is thought the Duke of York was invited to the course as a former captain of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews.

He spent an estimated £3,000 to fly to the Lancashire seaside on Friday to help keep his pilot's licence; holders are required to fly a certain number of hours each year.

In the past, the duke – whose penchant for travel has earned him the nickname Airmiles Andy – has been criticised for a number of golf-related public engagements.

In 2009 it is believed he spent £2,000 to hire a helicopter to go from his Windsor home to Kent, where he attended a party at a course of which he is patron.

A year earlier, he took his daughter Princess Beatrice to a tournament in the Emirates during a taxpayer-funded trip.

A palace spokesman said yesterday: 'The Duke of York played golf at Royal Lytham & St Annes in his own time and entirely at his own expense. There was no cost to the taxpayer.

'We believe strongly that where no public money is involved, nor a legitimate public interest to argue otherwise, members of the Royal Family are entitled to private lives.'

■ The Queen is seeking a member of staff to run baths at Windsor Castle – for £14,000 a year.

The successful applicant for the role of housekeeping assistant will carry out other chores, including 'the upkeep of carpeting and hard floor surfaces, fixtures and  fittings, general furnishings and . . . objects d'art'
