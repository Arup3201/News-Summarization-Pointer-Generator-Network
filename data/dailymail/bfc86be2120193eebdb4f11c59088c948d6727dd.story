A grieving family has received an apology from a lettings agency who invited potential tenants to view the home of a much-loved father and grandfather while his body was still inside.

George Murton, 88, died peacefully at the bungalow he cherished in Rainham, Kent, on April 19.

Within two hours of his death, his daughter Linda Preston, 65, notified Orbit Housing, who then posted details of the bungalow being available for rent on its website.

In shock: The family of George Murton, 88, were barely coming to terms with his death when prospective tenants arrived to look at his rented house in Kent (pictured)

Would-be tenants were allowed to visit the exterior of the property and even looked through the windows and the letter box as Mr Murton’s body was in his bedroom and the family was holding a wake.

Intrusion: Visitors began looking through the letterbox and windows while Mr Murton's body was still inside

In preparation for his funeral the family had decided not to move the grandfather from the home he had shared with his late wife Ann for 18 years.

Mr Murton’s close-knit family today said the 'intrusion into their privacy' had left them heartbroken.

Granddaughter Clare Marlow, 38, said: 'We all had a lot on our minds at the time and my mum was just being courteous.

'We had no idea it would be put on the bidding market within two hours.

'If we had known there would be people turning up we would have paid the extra rent for a couple of weeks.

'It is absolutely disgusting that people were knocking on the door when my granddad was being laid to rest in his bedroom.'

Stephen Hanley, lettings manager for Orbit South today issued an apology to the family.

He said: 'When a property becomes available, our usual procedure is to advertise it as soon as possible to allow us to promptly re-let homes to customers with a housing need.

'Our adverts do not give details of specific addresses, however once a property is advertised it is not uncommon for potential applicants to visit the location and try to establish which property will shortly be coming available.

Mistake: Orbit Housing has said that it has reviewed its procedures after puttyng the house up for rent on its website within hours of Mr Murton's death

'On this occasion, we advertised the property, but unfortunately on the same day we were contacted to notify us that the family was holding a wake.

'Once we became aware of the situation we contacted Mr Murton’s family to offer our apologies.

'We are extremely sorry for the upset caused and are reviewing our procedures as a result of their experience.'
