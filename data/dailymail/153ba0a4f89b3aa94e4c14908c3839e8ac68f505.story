A Russia Today correspondent based in London resigned yesterday in protest over her station's coverage of the attack on flight MH17. 

Sara Firth said reports being run by the station gave her a 'kick in the stomach'' and 'disrespected the facts', prompting her to hand in her notice.

She said it was the 'straw that broke the camel's back' after growing increasingly frustrated during her five years as an employee.

Disgust: Sara Firth handed in her resignation in a protest against Russia Today's coverage of the MH17 attack

The station, which is funded by the Russian government, has been criticised for blaming the tragedy on Ukraine. 

But most news outlets have suggested  that pro-Russian separatists were responsible for bringing down the airliner.  

She claimed to have had enough, suggesting that part of the station's style guide was to constantly blame Ukraine.

'It’s scary that it’s genuine RT guidance on how to do a story, and you have to believe it to succeed there,' she told Press Gazette:

'Yesterday when the story broke you get the kick in your stomach when you’re going to get the facts and it’s this huge story.'

'And I walked into the newsroom and they were running an eye-witness account of God-knows who the person was blaming the Ukrainian government, and it is such a volatile situation.'

Frustration: The reporter announced her resignation on Twitter saying she was 'for the truth'

Rules: She criticised the station's alleged guidelines - suggesting they always blame Ukraine 

She added: 'I said... if I was asked to burn the facts and not tell the truth I’d be a goner, and so I’m gone...And it’s the level of disrespect for the facts that really bugs me.'

In response to her resignation, a Russia Today spokesperson said that the channel and Firth 'apparently... have different definitions of truth'. 

A Russia Today spokesman said: 'We were not surprised by Sara Firth’s decision to leave RT after 5 years as a Moscow and London correspondent, as she has recently informed us that she was likely to take an offer from another firm.'
