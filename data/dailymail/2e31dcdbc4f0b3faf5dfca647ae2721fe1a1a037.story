We’ve had the selfie, the belfie and even farmers taking pictures of themselves - known as felfies - but now there’s a new type of photo littering news feeds.

Known as the Couplie, the photos taken in the style of a selfie but feature two people, either a couple or a pair of friends.

The #Couplie hashtag began to take off in November and saw a 140 per cent rise after singer Kylie featured in a couplie in December.

Selfies were the photo trend of 2013 and the term was crowned word of the year by Oxford Dictionaries.

Belfie,
 which stands for ‘bottom selfie’, is a photo taken deliberately a 
person’s own behind.

Healthselfies, or healthies, are selfies taken by people while exercising.

Felfies are self-portraits taken by farmers with their livestock.

Couplies are photos taken in the style of a selfie that feature two people, either a couple or a pair of friends.

The couplie featuring Kylie was taken by celebrity hair stylist Panos Papandrianos and posted on his Instagram account.

The post said: 'And it's a wrap. What a great shoot! Time for a #couplie ❤️ @kylieminogue #kylieminogue.'

In many situations, couplies are taken so people don’t have to ask someone else to take their picture.

According to personalised gift card firm, One4all, 60 per cent of all uploads over the Christmas period featured couple-style photos.

Selfies were the photo trend of 2013, fuelled by celebrities such as Justin Bieber, pictured. Photographer David Bailey has slammed the trend as a 'just another craze'

Belfie, which stands for ‘bottom selfie’, is a photo taken deliberately a person’s, while healthieselfies are selfies taken while exercising.

However, all of these types of photos are often criticised for being vain.

Speaking at the launch of his new 
retrospective at the National Portrait Gallery earlier this week, 
photographer David Bailey, 76, revealed he 'couldn't see the point' of 
selfies and condemned the trend as 'just another craze'.

He
 also said he expected to see the end of the selfie in the not too 
distant future, adding: 'It's just a silly moment and people won't be 
doing it in six months. There will be another craze.'

Declan Byrne, managing director UK of One4all, said the rising trend for couplies proves web users aren’t as narcissistic as first thought: ‘Our latest research indicates we are perhaps not as self-centred as we might think.

Couplies are more about sharing a moment with a friend or loved one than egocentric posing on social media.'
