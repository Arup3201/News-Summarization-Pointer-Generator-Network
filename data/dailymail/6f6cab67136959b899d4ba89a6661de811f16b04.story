The father of an 18-month-old girl who was rescued from a wrecked car 14 hours after it plunged into a frigid Utah river has revealed her incredible progress in a video taken from hospital.

Lily Groesbeck was released from Primary Children's Hospital on Wednesday, four days after her mother's wrecked car was spotted overturned and partially submerged in a river in Spanish Fork.

Lily's mother, 25-year-old Lynn Groesbeck, was killed in the crash but emergency responders found that the little girl was miraculously alive.

'I'm blessed,' Lily's father, 34-year-old Deven Trafny, told KUTV. I'm counting all my blessings right now... She should be gone. She shouldn't be here right now. I'm overwhelmed with joy right now.'

Safe: Dad Deven Trafny smiles as he looks at his daughter, Lily Groesbeck, in a video taken in hospital and released by the family. Lily has now left the hospital after surviving for 14 hours in a car wreck

On the mend: Trafny is seen playing with his daughter, who is back to her normal self, he has said

He also shared a video of Lily waving shyly at the camera in hospital as he holds her in his arms.

He said the toddler has been watching cartoons and laughing with her family members, and remembers everything she knew before the crash.

While caring for little Lily, Trafny is trying to comprehend losing the 'love of my life', his fiancée Lynn.

'That's kind of a hard situation for me right now,' he said. 'I haven't really wrapped my head around that. She was the love of my life and I'm going to miss her a lot. I still have to deal with that.'  

A fisherman spotted the car on Saturday, the day after it hit a cement barrier on a bridge and careened into the river in Spanish Fork, about 50 miles south of Salt Lake City. 

According to the Deseret News, the angler called a non-emergency line and said: 'Are you guys aware there's a car in the river on the south end of Spanish Fork, Main Street, over the bridge? I didn't see anybody when I came in here and I can't see in the car.'

Emotional: He said he is overjoyed and shocked that Lily survived the crash but that he is mourning 'the love of my life' - Lily's mother, Lynn Groesbeck, who was found dead in the wreckage

Then four minutes later, the same caller dialed 911 directly and said: 'There's a car in the river. It's upside down off of Main Street and there is a person inside. I can see a hand.'

Rescuers found the unconscious baby girl strapped into her car seat, where she had been hanging upside down for 14 hours as icy water flowed through the car. 

In a bizarre twist, emergency responders said they had heard desperate pleas from the mother inside the car, even though she had likely been killed on impact.

They reported hearing cries of: 'Help me! Help me!' 

Rescuers have said they are trying to figure out how they had heard the mother's voice. 

Family: The couple pose for a picture with their baby daughter, who has now left the hospital with just bruises

Mystery: Emergency responders said they arrived on the scene and heard Lynn calling out for help - but later realized she had died on impact. They said they are trying to fathom how they heard her voice

Officer Tyler Beddoes said: 'For two nights I've laid awake trying to figure out exactly what it could be. All I know is it was there, we all heard it. It was extra motivation.'

Beddoes said he and officers formed a line in the river and handed the cold girl to one another until she was on the shoreline and in emergency workers' arms.

They rushed her to an ambulance and performed CPR. 

It is still unclear how she managed to survive with no food or water, but a doctor told CNN that when someone suffers from hypothermia, their metabolism slows and their oxygen intake reduces, becoming 'neuro-protective'.

Jill Sanderson, Lynn's sister, said her sister was enrolled at Provo College with a goal of becoming a medical assistant, and had lived in the Provo area her entire life

When Lily was retreived from the car, police officers handed the cold girl to one another until she reached the shore and emergency workers could rush her to the hospital

Police were investigating what caused the crash but say Lynn Groesbeck could have been distracted or drowsy.

Spanish Fork police Lieutenant Matt Johnson told KUTV that investigators found a bag of what looks marijuana in the car, along with a bottle of 16 pills they think are pain medications and an opened syringe.

He said they won't know if drugs contributed to the crash until toxicology reports came back in several weeks.
