Jenson Button is eager to savour the challenge of Formula One's latest addition to the calendar.

The Sochi Autodrom, that winds its way around the site used for the Winter Olympics earlier this year, hosts this weekend's inaugural Russian Grand Prix.

The organisers are proudly boasting it to be the only track in the world to be located in an Olympic venue.

It also serves as both a permanent and a street circuit given it integrates into Sochi's general infrastructure during non-racing periods.

McLaren star Button said: 'It's always interesting to visit new circuits.

'It's fun to get out and explore the contours of the track, the kerbs, the run-offs, the camber.

'They're all the things you don't really fully experience until you're on-site and able to see the track for the very first time. That'll be my priority on Thursday.'

Assessing the venue from what he has seen so far via a simulator, Button added: 'From what I've seen of the place it's sort of a mix between the tracks we raced on in Valencia and Korea.

'There are plenty of long, fast straights hemmed in by concrete walls and high barriers, and a selection of medium-speed corners that seem to have been designed to test the abilities of a car.

'As with all these new venues, they only really begin to unlock themselves once you get out on the track for the first time.

'I've lost none of my enthusiasm for going to new places, so I'll be keen to get out there on Friday and get a feel for the place.'
