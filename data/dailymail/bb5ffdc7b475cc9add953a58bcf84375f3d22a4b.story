Nigel Pearson has taken a maverick approach to watching Leicester games, sitting in the stands and relaying instructions to his support staff while his peers prowl the touchline.

But he admits he may be forced to take cover in the dugout when he returns to his old club Hull City.

‘I don’t know where I’d be accommodated if I decide to sit in the stands,’ he said, ‘Perhaps I’ll sit among the Hull fans although I might get a bad reception.’

They have plenty of ammunition to throw at Pearson, who chose to leave and return to Leicester in 2011. His current side are 13 games without victory and five points adrift at the bottom of the table.

But Pearson claimed he would not treat Sunday’s game with Hull as though it determines his future employment.

‘I don’t ever feel I have to win otherwise (I get sacked),’ said Pearson. ‘If I thought like that I couldn’t sell what I say to the players in the dressing room. But ultimately, we have to start turning it around.’

Steve Bruce, meanwhile, insists Hull must accept they will be involved in this season’s relegation scrap, despite climbing out of the drop zone with their first win in 11 at Sunderland on Boxing Day.

Victory against Leicester at the KC Stadium on Sunday would increase the gap between his team and the league’s bottom club to nine points.

And Bruce said: ‘It’s a bigger game for me than the Cup final. Yes, I know that’s quite a statement, but that’s what it means to me.

‘If we turn them over to go nine points clear of them at the halfway stage, it’s a big turnaround to be caught.’

He added: ‘We’ve only been in the division a total of four years in our history so we’re going to be in and around it at the bottom. We always expected to be.

‘The league is starting to take shape at halfway. I could have called the bottom eight — and we have to accept we are going to be one of them.’
