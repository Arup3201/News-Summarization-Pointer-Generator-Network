An eight-year-old girl who beat cancer is now set to appear in a movie alongside film hunk James McAvoy.

Megan Finn auditioned against hundreds of other youngsters to win a role in the adaptation of Irvine Welsh's novel 'Filth'.

She traveled to Sweden to film her part as the daughter of lead character Bruce Robertson - played by McAvoy.

Yet just five years ago she was battling cancer, after doctors discovered a tumour on her kidney in 2007. Her parents had taken her to the doctor after noticing a swelling on her side.

She was rushed to Glasgow's Yorkhill Hospital for tests the same day and a week later they revealed Megan was suffering from a Wilms' tumour - a rare cancer that affects just 70 children in the UK each year.

Surgeons removed a 9cm tumour and one of the Megan's kidneys and she then underwent six months of chemotherapy.

Megan's mother Lesley, 38, from Houston, Scotland, said: 'We're so proud of Megan - she's been so brave through the whole cancer ordeal.

'And despite facing all the chemotherapy she never stopped smiling.'

She added: 'Working
with James McAvoy and Shauna Macdonald was great for her - Megan got on
so well with them and they praised her for her skills.

'Megan
- who is actually quite a shy girl - was able to transform when on set.
She really took it in her stride - I was more starstruck than her.

'To
think Megan went through the terrible moment with the kidney tumour, 
and chemotherapy, and can emerge such a happy young child is amazing. But she battled through it with such strength.'

Filming for 'Filth' took place last in 2012 - but Megan won't be allowed to watch it for a few years.

The dark movie focuses on bipolar, bigoted, drug addict cop Bruce Robertson who manipulates and hallucinates his way through the festive season in a bid to secure promotion and win back his family.

McAvoy plays Bruce and Canadian actress Shauna Macdonald is starring as his wife Carole.

Mrs Finn, who is a beauty therapist, said: 'James and Shauna were lovely - the two of them gave Megan a wee parcel with a scarf, two tops and a necklace in it.

'The necklace says 'Forever' and Shauna explained to Megan that she picked it because she is forever on film now she's made her first movie. I thought it was so nice of them.'

Megan, who has two sisters, Alex, 10, and Jessica, 6, has also appeared in an advert for kids toy Princess Fuzz as well as a brochure for Stirling Castle.

The young actress is still getting plenty of acting practise as she goes to theatre school and attends another theatre and dance group.

Filth, directed by Jon S Baird, will hit the big screen later this year.
