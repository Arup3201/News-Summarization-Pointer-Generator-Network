A budding film-maker has released a trailer for her own horror movie - after raising $31,900 (£20,000) to make it on Kickstarter.

Emily DiPrimio, 14, from Philadelphia, crowdsourced the funds so she could make her own '1980s-style slasher film'.

Co-written and co-directed by her father Ron, Carver is about 'a group of young teenagers who are haunted by a despicable act they committed when they were younger'.

The trailer for Carver - which stars unknowns Lea Davis and Mark Ryan Anderson - has now been released

The film stars unknown actors, including Lea Davis and Mark Ryan Anderson as well as other

On the trailer's official website, it continues: 'Their actions caused the death of three innocent people.

'Now on the anniversary of those deaths, an ominous calling card, in the form of a carved pumpkin has been placed at each of their homes.

'Someone is out for revenge... the question is who?'

Emily also promises that the film is a story of 'revenge and redemption' and a 'throwback to those wonderful slasher films of the Eighties'. 

Emily raised nearly £20,000 in donations to create Carver with the help of her father, Ron

And she adds: 'The kills are bloody and intense.'

Emily started her Kickstarter campaign to raise cash for the movie last year. The project, which had 528 backers, reached beyond its $25,000 target by October, raising an impressive $31,900.

The teenager wrote on her film's website ahead of the trailer launch: 'With the help of some wonderfully generous people we reached our Kickstarter goal. Now the movie is filmed and is in the process of being edited.'

Emily said her inspiration for making her own movie came after starring in a film for her father, who wrote a short script called Wake.

She wrote on her Kickster campaign: 'I can still remember how much fun we had making the movie.

'I learned first hand that when a group of people band together towards a common goal, anything can be accomplished.

'I've been hooked ever since.'

The teenager started to write her own movie script after having ankle surgery - meaning she was off her feet for 12 weeks.

The first trailer for Carver is out now although no formal release date for the film has been announced

She added on Kickstarter: 'I was really down and my dad noticed and asked if I would help him write this script he had been thinking about for a while.

'Before I knew it, we were writing Carver together which made the 12 weeks fly by.

'After we finished the first draft, I remember the pride I felt at having helped write a pretty darn good screenplay. I asked my dad if we could make it and of course he said we could try, but it takes a lot of time and money to make a feature film correctly.

'That is why I am here on Kickstarter - to humbly ask you to help me make my dream of making a slasher film with my dad come true.'

A release date for the film is yet to be announced.
