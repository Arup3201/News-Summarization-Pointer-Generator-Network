A unique collection of images beautifully illustrating the southern hemisphere's most amazing wildlife will be featured in an Australian gallery exhibition throughout October and November.

Photographers from across the globe will be vying for the Australian Geographic ANZANG Nature Photographer of the Year award, which recognises the most outstanding images taken from Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Antarctica across 10 categories.

Curators from the South Australian Museum will exhibit the works from October 10, before a winner is awarded the top prize of $10,000. In considering entries judges will take in to account the region in which the image was taken, as well as technique, aesthetics, and the artistic and unique quality of all images.  

South Australian Museum Exhibition Manager Tim Gilchrist said: 'Every image offers the viewer an opportunity to explore a new region or discover a new species they might never otherwise be introduced to.'

He said the competition encourages awareness of biodiversity and conservation in a fascinating and important part of the world.

The Editor-in-Chief of Australian Geographic Chrissie Goldrick said: 'This year's shortlist delivers a powerful statement about the diversity of the ANZANG region as perfectly executed portraits of miniscule invertebrates stand side by side with awe inspiring images of our largest and most majestic marine mammals.

Gentle Touch: As these nankeen kestrels mate, the male balances on the female’s back with its claws pointed inward, careful not to pierce the female’s delicate skin. Credit: Ofer Levy, Australian Geographic ANZANG Nature Photographer of the Year competition.

Stunned Mullet: An eastern osprey takes to the air with a large mullet in its talons. Ospreys carry their prey parallel while in flight, reducing air resistance. Mark Sanders, Australian Geographic ANZANG Nature Photographer of the Year competition

A mid-air drink: Southern Kimberley temperatures exceeded 40ºC for weeks and the wildlife was severely stressed. For thirsty birds, a dripping tap was an irresistible attraction. Some timed their approach with enough precision to snatch drops in mid-air. Steve Wilson, Australian Geographic ANZANG Nature Photographer of the Year competition

Young Nankeen Kestrel hovering: I followed a pair of nankeen kestrels which nested near a deserted soccer field. When their young fledged, they practised their hunting skills close to the nesting site, typically hovering about 10-20 metres above the field searching for insects and other small creatures. Ofer Levy, Australian Geographic ANZANG Nature Photographer of the Year competition

Regent Flight: This male regent bowerbird was photographed at O’Reilly’s Rainforest Retreat where these birds are used to people and offer great photo opportunities. Only the male has the beautiful bright colours. He typically builds a big bower where he tries to impress the females and mate with as many of them as possible during the breeding season. Ofer Levy, Australian Geographic ANZANG Nature Photographer of the Year competition

Soldier Crab Flamenco: These soldier crabs were poised near the entrance to a burrow. It looked as though they were comparing body size, and the clear disparity between them meant that the conflict was resolved without a fight. Similarly sized rivals tend to fight to determine who is going to occupy a burrow.  Ofer Levy, Australian Geographic ANZANG Nature Photographer of the Year competition

Australian Emperor Dragonfly: Australian emperor dragonflies are large, fiercely territorial and are found all over Australia. I spotted this individual sitting poised for take-off among the plants in my grandparents’ garden. Ian Bool, Australian Geographic ANZANG Nature Photographer of the Year competition

Fluorescent Landscape: Starry cup coral shows its colouration at high magnification under full-spectrum lights. Corals, similarly to numerous other tropical marine invertebrates, owe their remarkable colours to special fluorescent pigments. Fluorescent colours become apparent only under natural underwater illumination. Daniel Stoupin, Australian Geographic ANZANG Nature Photographer of the Year competition

Some you win and some you lose: The egrets that come in to fish on the mudflats near the Cairns Esplanade each evening are able to pluck fish after fish from the shallow waters with an alarming rate of success. As worrying as this must be for the fish, it sets the scene for some amazing photographs. Cameron Fletcher, Australian Geographic ANZANG Nature Photographer of the Year competition

Newborn: This smooth-skinned, newborn calf was less than a day old. You can still see the folds where it had been tightly wrapped in a foetal position. Scott Portelli, Australian Geographic ANZANG Nature Photographer of the Year competition

Collective: Hidden away on the coast of Western Australia, the town of Jurien Bay is home to a number of Australian sea lion colonies. Young females congregate on the beaches in harems controlled by a large single male or beach master.  Scott Portelli, Australian Geographic ANZANG Nature Photographer of the Year competition

Praise to the Rain: The other roos had seen this many times and merely sat drenched and depressed waiting for the storm to pass. The young bucks had something to prove, rearing back onto their tails to intimidate each other into submission. Charles H Davis, Australian Geographic ANZANG Nature Photographer of the Year competition

Mako Head: A poignant reminder of the controversy created by the sport of game fishing and the emotional reaction that such a sight can provoke. However, this mako shark did not die in vain, as it was used for scientific research on the species. Kirsten Woodforth, Australian Geographic ANZANG Nature Photographer of the Year competition

Rainbow Rebirth at Dusk: I was taking photos of the Murray River at night when I noticed this cicada on a nearby tree. Preparing my camera, I waited for the perfect moment when the elegant cicada filled the frame. Nicholas Volpe, Australian Geographic ANZANG Nature Photographer of the Year competition

Back from fishing: A pair of eastern ospreys took up fishing in my local river for two weeks. After finding their favourite fishing spot, I spent a few hours taking photographs of them while I was cloaked in camouflage.  Fatih Sam, Australian Geographic ANZANG Nature Photographer of the Year competition

Blizzard: I was a member of the Australian Antarctic Expedition on the East Antarctic fast ice when a nasty blizzard arrived. As we made our way to the safety of our ship, the dark shapes of a huddle of Adélie penguins could just be discerned amid the starkly beautiful icy landscape. Andrew Peacock, Australian Geographic ANZANG Nature Photographer of the Year competition

Beach quokkas: I found these two quokkas on the beach at sunset foraging for food. They were not shy towards people, no doubt used to being fed. Coming in looking for scraps, they got so curious that later I had to clean off little nose marks they had left on my lens. Charles H Davis, Australian Geographic ANZANG Nature Photographer of the Year competition

Gibber Ghost Gum: I took this photo of a ghost gum around Windorah in gibber country. It was early morning and the rocks in the foreground cast big, long shadows. I like that the roots stick out like a person’s remains are there; it makes it a real ghost gum. Rory O’Chee, Australian Geographic ANZANG Nature Photographer of the Year competition

Houseboat: These old boats left in Antarctica are a reminder of its terrible whaling past. The boats were abandoned with no thought of their impact on the environment. At Port Lockroy, these Gentoo penguins have embraced a decaying whale boat as their own while they shed their adolescent down feathers. Kirri Cetinich, Australian Geographic ANZANG Nature Photographer of the Year competition

The Surfacing: A humpback whale surfaces on the northern Austral winter migration. The whale had begun to exhale before breaking the surface, leaving a progressive trail of bubbles. Pam Osborn, Australian Geographic ANZANG Nature Photographer of the Year competition

Crimson Tidepool: I had been trying to capture images of these waratah anemones for several weeks but hadn’t had the perfect day. On this particular day the morning mist created a beautiful sun halo, and, as I took this shot, a gull flew right through the Sun’s orb. Matthew Smith, Australian Geographic ANZANG Nature Photographer of the Year competition

Princess Parrot: Wild Life Sydney Zoo in Darling Harbour has a flock of seven princess parrots that fly free around the urban zoo. Surveying them in the wild is very difficult as they are highly nomadic; it is believed that the captive population now outnumbers those left in the wild. Angela Robertson-Buchanan, Australian Geographic ANZANG Nature Photographer of the Year competition.

Salinity by Twilight: During winter this parched lake gains water that runs down from surrounding paddocks which have all been cleared for crops. Without any exit creeks, it sits still and slowly evaporates during summer, with salt growths and crystals forming on the dead trees. Keith Lightbody, Australian Geographic ANZANG Nature Photographer of the Year competition.
