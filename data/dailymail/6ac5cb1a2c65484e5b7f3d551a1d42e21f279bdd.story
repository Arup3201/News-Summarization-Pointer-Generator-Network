A Kansas home fruitlessly searched for marijuana during a two-state drug sweep turned out to belong to two ex-CIA employees

Two former CIA employees whose Kansas home was fruitlessly searched for marijuana during a two-state drug sweep claim they were illegally targeted, possibly because they had bought indoor growing supplies to raise vegetables.

Adlynn and Robert Harte sued this week to get more information about why sheriff's deputies searched their home in the upscale Kanas City suburb of Leawood last April 20 as part of Operation Constant Gardener - a sweep conducted by agencies in Kansas and Missouri that netted marijuana plants, processed marijuana, guns, growing paraphernalia and cash from several other locations.

The Hartes' attorney, Cheryl 
Pilate, said she suspects the couple's 1,825-square-foot split level was
targeted because they had bought hydroponic equipment to grow a small 
number of tomatoes and squash plants in their basement.

'With
little or no other evidence of any illegal activity, law enforcement 
officers make the assumption that shoppers at the store are potential 
marijuana growers, even though the stores are most commonly frequented 
by backyard gardeners who grow organically or start seedlings indoors,' 
the couple's lawsuit says.

The couple filed the suit this week under the Kansas Open Records Act after Johnson County and Leawood denied their initial records requests, with Leawood saying it had no relevant records.

The Hartes say the public has an interest in knowing whether the sheriff's department's participation in the raids was 'based on a well-founded belief of marijuana use and cultivation at the targeted addresses, or whether the raids primarily served a publicity purpose.'

The suit filed in Johnson County District Court said the couple and their two children - a 7-year-old daughter and 13-year-old son - were 'shocked and frightened' when deputies armed with assault rifles and wearing bullet proof vests pounded on the door of their home around 7:30 a.m. last April 20.

During the sweep, the court filing said, the Hartes were told they had been under surveillance for months, but the couple 'know of no basis for conducting such surveillance, nor do they believe such surveillance would have produced any facts supporting the issuance of a search warrant.'

The suit also said deputies 'made rude comments' and implied their son was using marijuana.

A drug sniffing dog was brought in to help, but deputies ultimately left after providing a receipt stating, 'No items taken.'

Pilate said no one in the Harte family uses illegal drugs and no charges were filed.

As well as growing vegetables, hydroponic equipment can be used to grow cannabis plants

The lawsuit noted Adlynn Harte, who works for a financial planning firm, and Robert Harte, who cares for the couple's children, each were required to pass rigorous background checks for their previous jobs working for the CIA in Washington, D.C.

Pilate said she couldn't provide any other details about their CIA employment.

Pilate said any details gleaned from the open records suit could be used in a future federal civil rights lawsuit.

'You can't go into people's homes and conduct searches without probable cause,' Pilate said.

Leawood City Administrator Scott Lambers said Friday that he couldn't comment on pending litigation. The sheriff's office also had no comment.

'Obviously with an ongoing lawsuit we are not able to talk about any details of it until it's been played out in court,' said Johnson County Deputy Tom Erickson.
