A former school bus driver in Virginia has been charged with assault for allegedly inappropriately touching a 13-year-old special needs student as he strapped her in a safety seat.

Bus surveillance footage from May 8 appears to show Johnnie Miller, 66, fondling the girl as he straps her into her bus safety contraption.

When school officials confronted Miller about the alleged sexual assault he told them his actions were 'just a little tickle game' he plays with the girl.

The Washington Post reports that Miller drives students to and from the Key Center, a special education campus in Springfield, Virginia.

Police began investigating Miller after a school bus supervisor was concerned with the way Miller was strapping the girl into the seat on May 6.

After reviewing surveillance footage, Fairfax County School Investigators told police that the girl appears to be yelling during her interaction with MIller.

When the bus attendant comes to check on why the girl is screaming, surveillance footage shows Miller yanking his hand away from the girl so the bus supervisor does not see his 'touching'.

Miller has been charged with both assault and battery,

NBC Washington reports that Miller retired on May 30 following the alleged assault.  

Miller, who lives in Fredericksburg, had been a driver since 1991 and he is due in court later this month.

The MailOnline tried contacting the Key Center but no one was available for comment.
