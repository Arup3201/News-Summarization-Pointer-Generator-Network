George Zimmerman's now-estranged girlfriend claims the guy she once called 'Georgie' spiraled into a deep depression after his acquittal in the Trayvon Martin case and has tried to kill himself multiple times, once putting a gun in his mouth and threatening to pull the trigger.

Samantha Scheibe was spotted leaving her Florida home Wednesday with an armed escort and under a towel, two days after the couple's violent argument, which saw Zimmerman ordered to stay 1,500 feet away from her at all times and hand over his array of guns.

But a revealing series of text messages and phone calls leading up to the blonde's frantic 911 call has painted a clearer picture of their volatile relationship and Zimmerman's life post-trial.

Girlfriend: George Zimmerman's now-estranged girlfriend Samantha Scheibe, shown in this undated picture, has revealed details about their relationship and his depression

Scheibe and her mother, Hope Mason, told ClickOrlando.com that Scheibe, whom Zimmerman began dating after she apparently consoled him following his break up with wife, Shellie, feared for her life but didn't leave because she thought she could help him.

After Shellie filed for divorce, Zimmerman moved into Scheibe's Seminole County home but their relationship soon fell apart because of his depression.

In late October, she demanded he get professional help but she said this made him angry and he moved all her furniture, clothes and food out of her home.

'She's scared is the bottom line,' Scheibe's mother, Mason, wrote in a text message to ClickOrlando.

The mother and daughter were in touch
with the news outlet as they were negotiating an interview that never 
materialized. They claimed they wanted to go public because they 
believed the media attention would keep Scheibe out of harms way.

'Things have gotten hotter on her end. He has shown up two times already today to her house, so we need to make a move sooner than later so she stays safe,' Mason wrote in a text message.

However, before an interview was arranged, Scheibe and Zimmerman made up and he moved her things back into the house.

But the relationship remained 
volatile and on one occasion soon after, Scheibe sought refuge at her 
mother's house to get away from Zimmerman.

While
there, Mason told ClickOrlando that Zimmerman sent Scheibe's daughter a
still image from an intimate home video of Scheibe and Zimmerman.

'He's now threatened her in writing and even sent a portion of the video to her baby girl,' Mason wrote in a text.

Despite this, the couple reunited again.
But on Monday, a terrified Scheibe called 911 for help, telling the 
operator Zimmerman put his gun in her face and was smashing up her 
furniture.

In cuffs again: George Zimmerman, the acquitted shooter in the death of Trayvon Martin, appeared in court on Tuesday on charges including aggravated assault stemming from the fight with his girlfriend November 19, 2013

He was charged with aggravated assault on Tuesday and ordered to keep his distance from his girlfriend whom he claimed was pregnant with his baby, and hand over his firearms.

In the messages to ClickOrlando, Scheibe said Zimmerman changed as soon as he was acquitted in the Trayvon Martin case.

She said he spiraled into a very deep depression after the media frenzy went away and while he was prescribed medication, after a while he stopped taking it.

Scheibe described how he spent days in bed, refusing to get up.

One day she found him passed out with an empty bottle of sleeping pills on his sidetable. She claims he overdosed and she wasn't able to revive him but noticed he was still breathing.

When he did wake, she said he started crying and then put a gun inside his mouth, telling her he was ready to end it all. She said she talked him out of killing himself.

But this wasn't the only occasion he threatened to take his own life, she said.

According to Scheibe, Zimmerman enjoyed the media attention he received from the Trayvon case and grew depressed when he wasn't in the headlines.
