A US Air Force fighter pilot was killed yesterday in a non-combat-related crash in the Middle East.

The F-16 jet crashed as it was returning to its base at an unspecified location in the region shortly after take-off.

The crash did not happen in Iraq or Syria, where US planes are engaged in a bombing campaign against Islamic State militants, the military said.

A US led strike campaign being launched in Iraq and Syria against the extremist group, which have seized wide swaths of territory in those two countries and declared an Islamic caliphate.

The US has several Middle Eastern bases supporting aerial efforts against ISIS elsewhere in the region.

These include Al Udeid in the Qatari desert, CENTCOM's forward headquarters in the Middle East; Al Dhafra Air Base, a base in the United Arab Emirates that hosts American aircraft; and the major base in Bahrain that hosts the US Navy's Fifth Fleet.

No further information was immediately available, and the cause of the incident was being investigated. 

Officials have not identified the pilot.
