Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri could  take  Mario Balotelli off Liverpool's hands in January after confirming his interest in the struggling striker.

Allegri worked with the Italy forward at AC Milan and has admitted he would like to bring his former player back to Serie A on loan with talk of a permanent option for £14million during the summer.

The 24-year-old has yet to score in the Barclays Premier League and, after Liverpool's 1-0 win at Sunderland on Saturday, said: 'This is the f*****g coldest city I’ve ever f*****g played in.’

But Balotelli could return to his native Italy after Allegri labelled him among the world's best.

'We would like to recruit him, but we do not know if it's possible,' The Times quote Allegri. 'Mario had a good season with me. 

'Unfortunately he's built up a character outside the world of football and everyone talks about what he does off the pitch. All coaches love to lead the best players.

'But Balotelli is a Liverpool player and I think first he has to think about playing well, sacrificing and giving his best - especially to show everyone who says he is an important player.'
