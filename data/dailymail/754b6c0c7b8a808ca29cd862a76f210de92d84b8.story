One of America's richest businessmen has sparked anger after he claimed the wealthiest 'one per cent' earn more money because they work harder than everybody else.

Sam Zell, who is estimated to be worth $4billion, made the incendiary claim during a live television rant on Wednesday night, insisting that the nation's affluent should be emulated, not criticized.

The Equity Group Investments founder's comments come at a sensitive time since billionaire venture capitalist Tom Perkins claimed the criticism of America's rich was akin to the persecution 
of Jews in Nazi Germany in the 1930s.

'We work hardest': Sam Zell, who is estimated to be worth $4billion, made the incendiary claim during a live television rant on Wednesday night, insisting that the nation's affluent should be emulated, not criticized

'The quote '1 per cent' are being pummelled because it's politically convenient to do so,' Mr Zell said in an interview on Bloomberg Televisionâ€™s "In the Loop" with Betty Liu.

'The problem is that the world and this country should not talk about envy of the 1 per cent it should talk about emulating the 1 per cent.

'The 1 per cent work harder. The 1 per cent are much bigger factors in all forms of our society.'

Controversial: Zell's comments come at a sensitive time since billionaire venture capitalist Tom Perkins claimed last month that America's war on the rich is akin to the persecution of Jews in Nazi Germany in the 1930s

Asked how he thought the average worker on the minimum wage could emulate his success, he said: 'The stories are rampant of people who started with a candy store and took it from there.

'There are lots of people who have the ambition and have the motivation and have succeeded.'

It comes weeks after Perkins, a founder of Kleiner Perkins
 Caufield & Byers, wrote a letter to the Wall Street 
Journal in which he said the public's turn against the rich represents a 'dangerous rift' in America and compares such progressive radicalism to
 the German Kristallnacht.

Comparisons: Mr Perkins referenced the Kristallnacht attacks on Jews in Germany in 1938

Anger: Resentment towards the super-rich has been building since the Occupy Movement began in September 2011 where protesters claim the global economy is engineered by an elite oligarchy of wealthy individuals to make the rich richer and the poor poorer

'I would call attention to the 
parallels of fascist Nazi Germany to its war on its "1 percent," namely 
its Jews, to the progressive war on the American 1 percent, namely the "rich,"' he wrote.

But Zell held back when asked for his views on Perkins' outburst.

'The word persecution is not the right word,' he said. 'I think that the politics of envy, the politics of class warfare are what has separated America from many parts of the rest of the world. And we have benefited dramatically from not having class warfare, from not having envy.'

Barack Obama has come under fire from the nation's financial elite for repeatedly insisting he wants to redress America's rich-poor balance since he came to power.

In his 2012 State of the Union address, Obama said: 'The defining issue of our time is how to keep that promise alive. No challenge is more urgent. No debate is more important. We can either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do really well, while a growing number of Americans barely get by, or we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, and everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules.'

Resentment towards the super-rich has been building since the Occupy Movement began in September 2011.

Occupy supporters claim the global economy is engineered by an elite oligarchy of wealthy individuals to make the rich richer and the poor poorer

Forbes counts Zell as America's 110th richest person with an estimated net worth of $4billion, accrued through his real estate and private equity empire.
