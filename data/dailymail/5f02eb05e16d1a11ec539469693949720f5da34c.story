The headmaster of a £28,000-a-year public school has resigned after beginning a relationship with the deputy head's wife, it was reported today.

Mark Eagers, 55, is said to have left his post at Box Hill School near Dorking, Surrey, when his relationship with Corydon Lowde's wife, Dinah, 43, was revealed.

Mr Lowde, 43, is now acting headmaster at the co-ed boarding school in the village of Mickleham, where his wife worked as a library assistant and Mr Eagers' wife, Jane, teaches business studies.

Box Hill School is a day and boarding school for girls and boys and fees go up to £28,000 a year for boarders

Parents say he stands at the school gates to welcome day pupils each morning and is working hard to ensure school life continues as normal.

Mr Eagers, a father of three who became head of Box Hill in 2003, now lists himself as 'former head of Box Hill School' on his LinkedIn profile, which shows he left the job in December.

Parents say Mrs Lowde, who has two children aged 18 and 15 with her husband, has been staying with Mr Eagers in his house yards from both the Lowde family home and the school.

Parents at the school are concerned the scandal will affect the reputation of the school.  One told The Sun: 'It is incredibly messy.  All four parties involved worked at the school.

'Dinah sometimes stays at Mark's, which is just metres from both her marital home and the school.

'Mr Lowde has been making a point of standing at the entrance to the school as parents drop their kids off in the morning, as if to say "I'm OK, I'm in charge."'

This morning a member of staff at the school, which has around 400 pupils aged 11-18, said the bursar, John Pratten, was preparing a statement.

Mr Eagers, who lists 'family' as his top interest on his LinkedIn profile, has sons aged 23 and 20, and a 16-year-old daughter with his wife of 25 years. 

He studied History at Cambridge University before doing an MA in Education at Bath University, and then worked at private Wycliffe College in Bristol teaching politics and history before spending a decade as head of history at the United World College of South East Asia in Singapore.

Mr Eagers was deputy head at Ardingly College in Sussex for four years before taking the top job at Box Hill, where he was a popular and dynamic head.

Mr Lowde studied at both Bath and Exeter universities before spending two and a half years as deputy headmaster of the British School of Boston in America.

Today he refused to comment as he left his white stone cottage opposite the school sheltered by a Union Jack umbrella, saying: 'I'm sorry, I'm heading in for a meeting now.

'I have no comment to make at this stage.'

He joined Box Hill three years ago, moving his family into the four-bedroom house nearby, which is now said to be on the market.

Last September a former history teacher at Box Hill was jailed after admitting a series of sex assaults on a young girl a decade before.

Lesley Powell, 57, was jailed for four-and-a-half years after pleading guilty to committing 10 sex offences on a girl who was younger than 13 when the abuse began.
