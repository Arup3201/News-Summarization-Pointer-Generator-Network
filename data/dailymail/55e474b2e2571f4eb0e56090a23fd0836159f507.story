Cambridge, Massachusetts, where the Tsarnaev brothers lived prior to their terror attack at the Boston Marathon, has announced they will not allow dead suspect Tamerlan's body to be buried there, it was revealed Sunday.

City manager Robert Healy said Tsarnaev's body was not welcomed in one of its cemeteries.

'I have determined that it is not in the best interest of peace within the city to execute a cemetery deed for a plot within the Cambridge Cemetery for the body of Tamerlan Tsarnaev,' Healey said.

The news comes as Tsarnaev's uncle,  Ruslan Tsarni, arrived in the Bay State to claim his nephew's body and prepare for a funeral.

Determined: Funeral director Peter Stefan accepted the body of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, determined to give him a 'dignified burial'

Meanwhile a funeral director's whose business is being protested and 
has turned away by every cemetery is determined with burying Tamerlan's body, saying everyone 
deserves a dignified burial regardless of the circumstances of their 
death.

Worcester, Massachusetts funeral home
 owner Peter Stefan said dozens of protesters have gathered outside his 
business, upset with his decision to handle the service.

‘My
 problem here is trying to find a gravesite. A lot of people don't want 
to do it. They don't want to be involved with this,’ Stefan said. ‘I 
keep bringing up the point of Lee Harvey Oswald, Timothy McVeigh or Ted 
Bundy. Somebody had to do those, too.’

Every cemetery in Massachusetts has turned down the body of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, Stefan told Fox News, but he remains insistent that this death be handled like any other. It is also understood that Stefan has reached out unsuccessfully to cemeteries in New Jersey and Connecticut.

Stefan firmly intended to provide Tsarnaev with tradition Muslim funeral rites, which some protestors take issue with.

It was unclear who, if any, among the deceased's family would step in to ensure the rites—such as the ritual bathing and shrouding of the body—were undertaken according to the religion's traditions.

Tsarni chose to step in, he said, because 'no one wants to associate their names with such evil events' and because religion and tradition call for his nephew to be buried.

Dealing:Tsarni and Stefan walk toward reporters. Tsarni arrived Sunday saying 'I'm dealing with logistics. A dead person must be buried.'

'I'm dealing with logistics,' he said. 'A dead person must be buried.'

Tsarni and three of his friends met with the Stefan Sunday afternoon.

Some picketers believe the bombing suspect should be buried at sea, similar to what was done with the body of Osama bin Laden.

Other protestors simply did not want Tsarnaev's remains in their town, like retired firefighter Ronald Wahlers.

'It’s going to give this neighborhood a bad name,' Wahlers, who has lived in Worcester for a year and a half, told the Boston Globe. 'This guy doesn’t belong here.'

Stefan disagrees.

‘I can’t control the circumstances of somebody’s death, or what they’ve done, or how they’ve died,’ he said. ‘In this country, we bury the dead.’

Tsarnaev, 26, died from ‘gunshot 
wounds of torso and extremities’ and blunt trauma to his head and torso,
 said Worcester funeral home owner Peter Stefan, who has the accused 
bomber’s body and on Friday read details from his death certificate.

The certificate lists the time of his death as 1:35 a.m. on April 19, four days after the deadly bombing, Stefan said.

Tsarnaev died after a gunfight with authorities who had launched a massive manhunt for him and his brother, ethnic Chechens from Russia who came to the United States about a decade ago. Police have said he ran out of ammunition before his younger brother dragged his body under a vehicle while fleeing.

Tsarnaev's family was making arrangements Friday for his funeral as investigators searched the woods near a college attended by 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was captured less than a day after his brother's death.

Body: Tsarvaev's body is now at Graham Putnam and Mahoney Funeral Parlors in Worcester, waiting to be buried

The body was released by the state medical examiner Thursday. It initially was taken to a North Attleborough funeral home, where it was greeted by about 20 protesters, before being taken to Stefan's Graham Putnam and Mahoney Funeral Parlors, which is familiar with Muslim services.

Meanwhile, two U.S. officials said Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told interrogators that he and his brother initially considered setting off their bombs on July Fourth.

Boston police said they planned to review security procedures for the Independence Day Boston Pops concert and fireworks display, which draws a crowd of more than 500,000 annually and is broadcast to a national TV audience. Authorities plan to look at security procedures for large events held in other cities, notably the massive New Year's Eve celebration held each year in New York City's Times Square, Massachusetts state police spokesman David Procopio said.

Gov. Deval Patrick said everything possible will be done to assure a safe event.

As part of the bombing investigation, federal, state and local authorities were searching the woods near the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth campus, where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was a student. Christina DiIorio-Sterling, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz, could not say what investigators were looking for but said residents should know there is no threat to public safety.

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was found 
hiding in a tarp-covered boat in a backyard in Watertown, a Boston 
suburb, faces a charge of using a weapon of mass destruction to kill. 
Three of his college classmates were arrested Wednesday and accused of 
helping after the bombing to remove a laptop and backpack from his 
dormitory room before the FBI searched it.

The
 April 15 bombing, which used pressure cookers packed with explosives, 
nails, ball bearings and metal shards, killed three people and injured 
more than 260 others near the marathon's finish line.

Angry: Dozens of protestors have begun picketing Stefan's business, like Scott Schaeffer-Duffy, pictured, who crossed the Boston marathon finish line minutes before the bombs detonated

The brothers decided to carry out the attack before Independence Day when they finished assembling the bombs, the surviving suspect told interrogators after he was arrested, according to two U.S. officials briefed on the investigation. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation.

Investigators believe some of the explosives used in the attack were assembled in Tamerlan Tsarnaev's home, though there may have been some assembly elsewhere, one of the officials said. It does not appear that the brothers ever had big, definitive plans, the official said.

The brothers' mother insists the allegations against them are lies.

Meanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security ordered border agents to immediately begin verifying that every international student who arrives in the U.S. has a valid student visa, according to an internal memorandum obtained Friday by The Associated Press. The new procedure is the government's first security change directly related to the Boston bombings.

The order from a senior official at U.S. Customs and Border Protection, David J. Murphy, was circulated Thursday and came one day after President Barack Obama's administration acknowledged that one of the students accused of hiding evidence, Azamat Tazhayakov, of Kazakhstan, was allowed to return to the U.S. in January without a valid student visa.

Tazhayakov's lawyer has said he had nothing to do with the bombing and was shocked by it.
