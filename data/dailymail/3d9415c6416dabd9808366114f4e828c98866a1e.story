Representative: Singer Peter Andre was elected by a unanimous vote among Valletta's councillors

British-Australian artist Peter Andre has been appointed cultural ambassador to the capital of Malta, leaving its population in uproar.

Residents of the Mediterranean island nation are furious with Valletta city councillors who voted unanimously to appoint the Mysterious Girl singer, despite the fact that he has no links to Malta.

More than 1,000 Maltese have signed a petition to oust the 39-year-old artist from his role, which includes the responsibility to promote the rich history and art of the 16th century city.

The pop singer has Mediterranean family ties through his Greek-Cypriot background, but Mr Andre was born in London, grew up in Australia and has never lived in Malta.

The
appointment was branded ‘100 times worse’ than the honorary citizenship
given to Spanish singer-songwriter Enrique Iglesias, in 2008.

The
petition reads: ‘Peter Andre should be the last person to carry such a 
prestigious and important title.

'Valletta shall only be handled with 
honour.’

Peter Andre won ‘Best International Male’ at the Malta Music Awards last week where he also performed as headline act.

Despite having been appointed Valletta's cultural ambassador the very same day, Mr Andre made no mention of this on stage

'We wanted a celebrity fond of Valletta,' Mayor Alexei Dingli told The Sun, defending the city council's vote.

Mr
Dingli also claim the city will feature in Peter Andre’s ITV show and 
said that Mr Andre had ‘promised to come again this summer where we will
be discussing potential future collaborations.'

The city of Valletta was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1980 and has a population of just 7,000.

The Republic of Malta itself is home to 450,000 people and consists of an archipelago with three main islands.

Valletta is located on the main island, also called Malta, which also has the 
most populated city, Birkirkara, home to just over 22,200.

Malta
gained its independence from Britain in 1964 and joined the EU in 2004.
Since 2008 the small island nation has also been part of the eurozone.
