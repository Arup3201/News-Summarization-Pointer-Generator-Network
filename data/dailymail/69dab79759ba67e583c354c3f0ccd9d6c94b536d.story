Tesco's bagged salads boast that they are 'washed and ready to eat'. But this cautionary tale might dissuade you from chucking out the salad spinner just yet.

A vegetarian was about to tuck into a Tesco salad for supper when found a five-inch locust living inside it.

The nurse, from Prestatyn, North Wales, says the sight of the locust wriggling around in the plastic bag of mixed salad leaves has put her off eating the stuff 'for weeks'.

A delicacy to some... But a horrid shock for the woman in north Wales who found him in her salad

She said she got the 'shock of her life' when she saw the insect's legs moving as she sat down to tuck into the £1.50 salad.

The 40-year-old, who preferred not to be named, freed the hapless creature in her garden, but said the experience 'scared the life' out of her and left her 'totally freaked out'.

'When I picked the salad up I thought it felt a bit heavier than usual - and then I got the shock of my life,' she said.

'I couldn’t believe it. I put the poor thing in my garden because it had been in my fridge for two days.

'I took the packaging back to Tesco the next morning and they said they would send it off to do a report.

'I didn’t eat the salad. I’m a vegetarian and so I buy bags and bags of salad. I’m pretty tough but that was enough to put me off for weeks.

'It scared the life out of me, I totally freaked out.'

I'd like to say sorry: The letter of apology from a Tesco customer service manager about the locust

The woman had kept the salad in her fridge for two days, and hadn’t bothered to wash the leaves as she normally would when she made the shocking discovery.

She reported the incident to her local store and has since received an apology letter from them, along with a voucher for £10.

A spokesman for Tesco said: 'We set ourselves very high standards for the safety and quality of our food.

'We have written to our customer to apologise and we continue to investigate her complaint with our supplier.'
