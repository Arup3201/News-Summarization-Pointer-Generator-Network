Lance Armstrong is due to appear in court next month after allegedly crashing into two parked cars and then leaving the scene without reporting the incident.

According to the police report, the crash occurred in late December in Aspen, Colorado, with Armstrong and his girlfriend Anna Hansen then departing the scene before officers had arrived.

The report said Hansen later told police she had been driving before changing her story.

It said Hansen was initially cited, having told officers that, while driving the couple back home from an Aspen Art Museum party and going too fast for the snowy conditions, she lost control of her vehicle and struck two parked cars before speaking to the owner and offering to pay for the damage.

One of the officers involved said due to suspicions over this story, he then spoke to a valet for the art museum party, who told him it had been Armstrong who had driven away from the event.

The report added that Hansen subsequently admitted she had been the passenger and that Armstrong had been the driver.

Hansen is quoted in the report as saying that her taking the blame had been "a joint decision" between her and Armstrong made in a bid to avoid negative headlines.

The charges were transferred to the 43-year-old former cyclist, who was stripped of his seven Tour de France victories and banned for life from racing in 2012 after he admitted using performance-enhancing drugs.

He is due to appear in court on March 17.
