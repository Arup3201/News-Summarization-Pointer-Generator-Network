On one unfortunate occasion, Winnie the Pooh got his head stuck in a honey jar.

But it seems the cuddly bear has got himself into stranger predicament, after he was flushed down the toilet.

Along with a pink bike and a fax machine, the stuffed bear was among the unusual objects clogging sewers last year.

Blocked by Pooh: The teddy bear was found in a sewer in East Kilbride, Scotland

The items were dragged out of sewers by Scottish Water workers throughout last year.

Among these were a pair of jeans, pants, mobile phones, toy soldiers, a deckchair, false teeth and a golf club.

On one occasion, a credit card stolen from a Scottish Water employee turned up on the screens of the sewage works.

The company said around 80 per cent of the blockages were caused by people putting the wrong things down sinks and toilets.

Stuck: A pair of jeans were found blocking a pipe in Strathblane

Strange: An action man figure, a watch, a ring and a mobile phone were all said to have caused problems in drainage systems last year

Most were caused by cooking fat and oils, or bathroom waste such as cotton buds, nappies and baby wipes.

The company has launched a campaign to stop people flushing rubbish down their drains, highlighting the Â£7 million annual cost to taxpayers.

Chris Wallace, director of communications at Scottish Water, said: 'The waste water drain which runs from your house to the public sewer is usually only about four inches wide, which is less than the diameter of a DVD.

'This drain is designed to take only the used water from sinks, showers and baths and pee, poo and toilet paper from the toilet.

'Scottish Water believes the best way to tackle blocked drains and sewer flooding is to work with our customers to prevent blockages that can clog up the cycle in the first place.'

Broken: The items, including clothing, become tangled in pipes and cause them to break. This happened at a water plant in Dumfries and Galloway (pictured)
