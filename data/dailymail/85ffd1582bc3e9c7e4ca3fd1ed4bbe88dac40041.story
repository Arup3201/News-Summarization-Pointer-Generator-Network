He was just a fresh-faced 16-year-old when he was killed fighting with Australian troops in Gallipoli on November 7, 1915.

Roy Henderson Robertson, from Scarborough in NSW, enlisted with the Australian Imperial Force's 20th Infantry Battalion just four months before he was killed.

A portrait of the grocer's assistant, who rests at Gallipoli's Walker's Ridge Cemetery, has been in a collection owned by the State Library of NSW for almost a century.

Roy Henderson Robertson, from Scarborough in NSW, was killed in action fighting in the 20th Infantry Battalion at Gallipoli on November 7, 1915. He was just 16 years old when he was killed and he rests alongside 29 other Australians at Gallipoli's Walker's Ridge Cemetery

Jack Hodgson was left blind after he was wounded in Gallipoli around 1915. He served in the 4th Battalion and is pictured here showing his service medals to his son

Now, the library has launched an exhibition in a bid to return Roy's portrait, and those of more than 230 other First World War soldiers, to surviving family members.

The portraits have hand-written, personal details on the back of each print that denote whether soldiers made it home or not.

The majority of photos were taken in 1918 when First World War soldiers in NSW were invited to have their portraits taken in Sydney before they went overseas to fight.

William Hugh Gilmour, 19, safely returned to Sydney in July 1919 after serving in the 25th Battalion. The Marrickville resident had worked as a clerk when he enlisted in May 1918

Thomas Alexander Roper, 20, died of pneumonia on October 11, 1918 in South Africa. The Pyrmont resident enlisted in May 1918 and served as a private in the 12th Australian Reinforcements unit. He rests at Woltmade Cemetery in Cape Town

Ernest William Hall, 20, enlisted in Goodna Queensland on April 25, 1918. He served as a gunner before returning to Australia on April 1, 1919 - just shy of a year to the date he left

21-year-old Francis Patrick Leonard returned to Australia on July 23, 1919. Francis, born in Longueville, worked as a clerk before he became a gunner in the Royal Australia Artillery

Sydney's Crown Studios, a leading photographic studio at the time, collected more than 1,600 portraits taken of soldiers or copied from existing prints provided by family members.

The portraits, which were donated to the State Library, are now being shown for the first time in nearly 100 years as part the WWI centenary program, Portraits of War. They give a fascinating insight into the individual faces of soldiers, both young and old, who served their country.

The project was never completed by the photography studio after a fire severely damaged the studio in December 1918.

While copies of the portraits were protected in a fireproof safe, the studio did not reopen again until the following year.

'The information on the back of each print is just as moving as the portraits themselves,' exhibition curator Louise Tegart said.

'These portraits could be the only photograph families had of their sons, brothers or uncles, and this has compelled the State Library to provide copies of the portraits featured in the exhibition to the relatives of the soldiers in NSW.

'We're also keen to know more about the soldiers in the pictures and hope that relatives will come forward and help add information to their individual stories.'

Edward Morey was believed to be 22 when his portrait was taken.  He was born in Naguligon in NSW and worked as a labourer before enlisting
