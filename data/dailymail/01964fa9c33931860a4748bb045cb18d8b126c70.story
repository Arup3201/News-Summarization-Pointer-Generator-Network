A young cricketer has made history by bowling over her male teammates after becoming the first female to play in a league after 125 years.

Chloe Wallwork entered the record books with her maiden appearance as a first team player in the Bolton Association - Lancashire's oldest league.

And not only did the 20-year-old make her first team debut for Walshaw but she took four wickets in 11 overs - including four maidens - helping her teammates to a resounding victory over Golborne.

However, despite breaking down the boundaries Chloe, who also plays for Lancashire's women's team, has taken it all in her stride.

She said: 'I didn't even know that I was the first girl to play first-team cricket in the league for 125 years until I read about it.

'Growing up, I was the only girl to play cricket. The rest of the girls I knew were talking about boys.'

Chloe first picked up a bat and ball aged five, playing in the street with her brother Ryan, now aged 24.

She started playing for Walshaw three 
years later. Within a year, she was scouted by Lancashire, and has since
been on tour twice to South Africa with the women's team.

Chloe, from Tottington, has been playing for Walshaw's second team for the last four years.

Chloe added: 'When everyone sees me coming out they have a bit of a laugh, but I'm used to that because I've always been the only girl in the team.

'When I'm bowling against them they either try to slog me or block me because they don't want to get out to a girl.'

It is not just cricket Chloe loves - she spends each night of the week doing some form of sport.

She said: 'I play for Walshaw on Tuesdays, Lancs on Thursdays, and I also play rounders on Mondays and football on Wednesdays.

'Then there's the cricket matches on the weekend. Sometimes I do ache but it's worth it.'

Coach Darren Foy has tipped her for more first-team action.

'She asked me if I'd give her a chance and I'm glad I did,' he said. 'She'll probably get a few more games on the strength of what she did on Saturday.

'She bowled well, she's a good fielder, and when she's bowling she's not scared of giving the fielders a bit of a rocketing.'

David Leach, chairman at Walshaw, added: 'Chloe has played here since she was a youngster and has come up through the junior teams up to the second team and she took her chance at the weekend.

'She's constantly proving herself and was more than a match for the others in the game. She's a great girl and very competitive and always gives the lads a hard time.'
