A student who piled on the pounds at university has dropped six stone after giving up her party animal ways and 385 calorie pints of snakebite and black.

Charlotte DeAbreau, 24, tipped the scales at 15st 11lb and was struggling to fit into a size 18 when she finished her degree at Bangor University, North Wales.

The substance misuse worker from Walsall, West Midlands, put on weight after nights out drinking her favourite 'snakebite and black' which is equal parts cider and lager, diluted with blackcurrant  cordial and has a staggering 385 calories a pint.

Charlotte DeAbreau, 24, from Walsall, piled on weight while at university, eating Indian takeaway for dinner and pizza late at night. She also downed beer, wine and alcopops several times a week. After graduating, she started dieting and lost six stone in a year 

Party girl Charlotte would often tuck into a whole pizza or cheesy garlic bread after a night out, and after hitting the clubs at least three evenings a week, her lifestyle took a massive toll on her figure.

But after she photographs of herself in a graduation gown, Charlotte ditched the junk food and booze and has now shed a massive SIX stone and can now wear size 10 dresses.

She said: 'I would pre-drink in our student flat with housemates before we went out and would usually drink wine, lager and some apple Sourz shots with lemonade.

'We would often play drinking games like Ring of Fire  - a card game that  involves a dirty pint of all of our drinks mixed together.

'When I was out I would drink snakebites and black and would always get takeaway on the way home, which was often a whole pizza.'

Charlotte continued: 'I was bigger as a child but I really piled on the weight when I went to uni due to the cycle of late nights, drinking and snacking on junk.

'When I went to uni, I suddenly had a new sense of freedom and I was in charge on my own finances.

'I would eat a lot of convenience foods like pizzas, takeaways and McDonalds, not to mention all of the drinking.

'As I gained weight, I became really self-conscious of my arms. I would even wear long sleeves in the summer because I felt so uncomfortable.'

When Charlotte finished university, she embarked on a healthy eating plan with Slimming World and was amazed to lose seven pounds in her first week.

Charlotte said: 'It was such a great achievement to lose the weight and as I could see my body changing, I was so determined to keep going.

'I changed my eating habits and learnt to cook healthy meals, but I also ditched the booze.

'It was such a thrill to see the weight dropping off me.' 

Just over a year later and Charlotte passed her goal weight of 10st 5lbs, she carried on dieting and now weighs just 10 stone.

After losing the weight, Charlotte decided to use her experience in a work capacity and took up a job as a substance misuse worker, where she helps others who are struggling with alcohol and drug abuse

She said: 'When I was at uni, I wasn't looking after myself. I was just living the student life of eating and drinking too much.

'Now I have control of my life and have a job I love where I am helping others.

'Before I couldn't wear the clothes I wanted to because nothing fashionable fitted me, but now I have a whole wardrobe of clothes which I love.

'I can finally shop in Topshop for clothes, which is amazing. I have so much more confidence now. 

'I am looking forward to seeing what the future holds now I am in control of my life.'
