A Central Texas meteorologist who survived a shooting is out of the hospital and recovering, his wife said Friday.

'We're home!' Patrick Crawford's wife Heather Brinkmann, said in a Friday Facebook post. 'Patrick, the kids, and I had a wonderful Christmas, and we hope you all did too! Patrick continues to get better every day. He still is in a lot of pain, but he continues to amaze me with his positive attitude!'

Brinkmann also included a photograph of her husband with a pooch - whom she referred to in her post as 'one of our kids, Dirk.'

Both Crawford and Brinkmann are meteorologists for affiliate news station KCEN.

Brinkmann's Friday Facebook post was earlier picked up by KXXV.

Last week, Crawford said in a press conference filmed by ABC News of shooting outside the KCEN offices 'He started shooting at me as I was leaving the parking lot.'

'The man that shot me didn't say any words to me,' Crawford also said. 'There was no interaction whatsoever. I did not know him.'

Crawford was shot December 17 in the station parking lot. The unknown suspect fled on foot.

'[Crawford] was entering the car when the exchange of gunfire, or the gunfire started,' Highway Patrol Trooper DL Wilson told KHOU. 'He did an excellent job getting in the car speeding off and probably saved his life.'

Crawford sped toward construction workers approximately 100 yards from him then asked for aid, KHOU reported.

The workers contacted 911 and gave him first aid, the affiliate station reported.

Crawford suffered head and shoulder injuries after a bullet grazed them, and he was also shot in his abdomen, The Huffington Post reports.

Speaking about a sketch of the suspect, Crawford said at the conference 'Hopefully that description is going to help to bring this person to justice for what he did and the crime that he committed.

Crawford had expressed his wish to see his loved ones at the press conference last week.

'My main focus is just to continue to get better, to get healthy and to get home for me and my family,' he said at the time.

No arrest has been made in the case, and a motive has not been identified.
