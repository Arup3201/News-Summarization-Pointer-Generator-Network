Former film star Jean Kent has died aged 92, it has been announced.

Ms Kent was one of Britain's top box-office stars in the 1940s and 1950s and acted in dozens of films and TV shows in a career spanning 50 years. Her death was announced by close family friend, author and former film critic Michael Thornton.

Mr Thornton said the actress was injured in a fall at her home in the Suffolk village of Westhorpe on Thursday.

She was taken by ambulance to West Suffolk Hospital in Bury St Edmunds where she died at 3.40am today.

Mr Thornton said: 'I knew Jean for 
more than 50 years. She was a feisty, funny, outspoken character who 
never took herself too seriously. She knew what it meant to be a star, 
and regarded it as her job to live up to that position and never to 
disappoint the public.'

He
 added: 'Because she became one of the most famous stars of the 
Gainsborough era, with its bodice-ripping melodramas, she was underrated
 as an actress. But she was a great actress.'

Ms Kent made her last public appearance in June 2011 when she was honoured by the British Film Institute (BFI) on her 90th birthday. It screened one of her films, Caravan, at BFI Southbank in London.

Her career included regular 
appearances in Gainsborough melodramas, which were popular with large 
numbers of newly-independent women following the outbreak of the Second 
World War.

Her co-stars during her film career included Marilyn Monroe, Michael Redgrave and Laurence Olivier.

For
 a number of years, British film exhibitors voted her among the top ten 
British stars at the box office via an annual poll in the Motion Picture
 Herald

Ms Kent was born as
 Joan Summerfield in Brixton, south London on June 29, 1921, the only 
child of variety performers Norman Field and Nina Norre, and started her
 career in 1931 as a dancer.

She
 used the stage name 'Jean Carr' when she appeared as a chorus girl in 
the Windmill Theatre in London and signed to Gainsborough Pictures 
during the Second World War.

The
 turning point in her career came when she was given a dramatic part in 
1945 film Fanny, by Gaslight. She appeared in several British films 
during the 1940s and 1950s before turning to television.
