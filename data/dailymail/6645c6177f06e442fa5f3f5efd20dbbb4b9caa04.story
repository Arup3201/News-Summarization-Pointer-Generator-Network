Perpetually rushed New
 Yorkers have been telling cabbies to 'step on it' for as long as there 
have been taxis, but the city wants to brake that hurry-up habit, in 
part by attacking the financial incentive to speed.

Cabs
 could be outfitted with black-box-style data recorders and devices that
 would sound warnings - or even pause the fare meter - for going too 
fast, even as speed limits on most city streets would drop from 30 to 25
 mph.

Mayor Bill de Blasio, who made the 
proposals as part of his broader safe-streets plan, says drivers of New 
York's signature yellow cabs rightly should play a particular role in 
his push to curb traffic crashes.

'They set the tone on our streets,' de Blasio said.

Under ambitious proposals that seek to get New York City cabs to slow down, black boxes inside cabs would shut the toll meter off whenever a cab goes above the posted limit, which is 25 mph in much of Manhattan

While
 traffic advocates applaud the ideas, they are getting a bumpy reception
 at taxi stands.

Cabbies fear friction with passengers and feel they're 
being scapegoated, and riders say they're torn between the drive for 
safety and the need for speed.

'When I'm in a 
rush, anything is appreciated,' New Yorker Emily Baltimore said as she 
waited in a cab line outside Penn Station this week.

New
 York's Taxi and Limousine Commission says it is still exploring the 
ideas, which would require a range of approvals.

The traffic safety plan
 also includes more taxi-rule enforcers, stiffer penalties for cabbies' 
driving violations and many provisions aimed at all cars, not just 
taxis.

Deadly auto wrecks have dropped sharply
 in the nation's biggest city, from 701 in 1990 to an all-time low of 
249 in 2011, as officials redesigned dangerous intersections and made 
other changes.

But recent pedestrian deaths have pushed the issue to the
 forefront.

Nine-year-old Cooper Stock was in a Manhattan crosswalk, holding his father's hand, when a left-turning taxi hit them Jan. 10.

Cooper
 was killed.

The driver was ticketed but hasn't been criminally charged,
 though authorities are still investigating.

Under current rules, the 
accident wasn't grounds to suspend his otherwise clean license.

Cooper's mother says cabbies need to be held accountable for making streets safer.

'They
 should be the best drivers in the city. They are professional drivers,'
 said Dana Lerner, a psychotherapist.

While her main goal is tougher 
consequences for taxi crashes, she feels black boxes and other 
technology could deter bad driving.

The 
results would ripple through traffic, as cabbies' driving 'dictates 
behavioral norms to other drivers,' said Paul Steely White, who runs 
Transportation Alternatives, a group backing de Blasio's plan.

While
 New York's more than 50,000 cabbies may have a hard-driving image, they
 note they have eight hours a day worth of reasons to be careful.

Just
 about 4 percent of the roughly 200,000 vehicles involved in accidents 
citywide last year were yellow cabs, according to an Associated Press 
analysis of police statistics.

A 2004 study 
showed taxis had a below-average crash rate, on a per-mile-driven basis,
 though a 2010 city report suggests they play a bigger role in 
collisions that kill or seriously injure pedestrians.

Taxi and 
car-service cabs were involved in 13 percent of those crashes, though 
they account for only about 2 percent of the cars on the road, the 
Transportation Department report showed.

Cabbies
 feel de Blasio's traffic safety plan unduly singles them out for 
scrutiny, a sentiment hardly lessened when a news camera caught the 
mayor's official, police-driven vehicle speeding two days after he 
unveiled the plan.

And taxi drivers and owners fear slowing down could 
mean losing business.

'People want to go, 
hurry, because they don't have a lot of time. They spend money to save 
the time,' says Jawad Habib, a cabbie for 21 years who says he makes 
sure to know traffic rules.

He fears a lower speed limit could lengthen 
taxi trips enough that 'who's going to want to sit in the cab? ... 
They'll go to the bus.'

The drivers' union, 
the Taxi Workers Alliance, and the Metropolitan Taxicab Board of Trade 
owners' group raised some red flags at a City Council hearing, though 
the owners' organization supports the lower speed limit and some other 
ideas.

Some limousine and car-service fleets 
around the country have seen accidents drop by 50 percent or more after 
installing data recorders, said Matthew Daus, a former New York taxi 
commissioner who's now president of the International Association of 
Transportation Regulators.

But the devices can be unpopular with drivers
 and can bump up against legal questions in an industry in which many 
drivers are independent contractors, not employees.

Black boxes inside cabs would shut the toll meter off whenever a cab goes above the posted limit - 25 mph in much of Manhattan - and drivers would be alerted they are going too fast

It's unclear whether anyone has developed devices linking speed and fare meters, but experts say it's feasible.

Vehicle
 security-camera company VerifEye Technologies Inc., for example, 
recently started offering a feature that can send a cab company a 
message if a car breaks the speed limit, discerned by a combination of 
GPS and speed-zone maps, Vice President Terry Walker said.

The Markham, 
Ontario-based company has mapped Toronto, Chicago and a handful of other
 cities so far.

The system could be adapted to pause a meter if regulators allowed it, Walker said.

Meanwhile, cabbie Yick Li relies on his own anti-speeding system: himself.

After
 32 years behind a taxi wheel, he simply says no if a passenger urges 
him to speed or break other rules.

Some riders gripe, he said, but many 
understand.

'They sit back, relax, let us do the driving.'
