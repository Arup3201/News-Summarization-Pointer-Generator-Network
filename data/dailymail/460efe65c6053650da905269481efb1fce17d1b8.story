Jailed: IT worker Robert Weir, 37, has been jailed for 12 years for the sexual assault and rape of a child

A rapist has been jailed after his 12-year-old victim found the courage to tell police because she watched a sex attack storyline on television drama The Bill.

Robert Weir, 37, was arrested after the girl broke down as she watched the show with her mum and revealed the full extent of his crime.

Weir, an IT worker from Preston, Lancashire, had earlier pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting the child but was put on trial for the more serious charges.

Today he was sentenced to 12 years in jail after a jury found him guilty of rape and sexual assault.

The offences first came to light after the girl's parents discovered text messages from Weir on her mobile phone, Preston Crown Court heard.

She told them Weir had sexually assaulted her and the police were called.

But the girl made further allegations when she watched the story of a teenaged rape victimÂ  on ITV's The Bill.

Her mother asked if she would like to change the channel but instead the girl left the room and locked herself in the bathroom, where her mother found her 'sobbing her heart out'.

She told her mum she had not told her everything that had happened with Weir and went on to say he had raped her.

The child, who can not be identified for legal reasons, told the court she was 'ashamed and disgusted' about what had happened and feared her family would hate her if they found out.

The court heard that Weir groomed the victim over a period of time prior to committing the offences in 2012.

Sentencing Weir, Judge Altham: 'This case concerns you sexually exploiting a young girl, she was 12, she hadn't yet reached her 13th birthday.

Courage: The court heard the girl found the courage to tell her mother after watching an episode of The Bill

'She was a girl who had and has her own problems. You sexually exploited her. I repeat she was 12 at the time.

'The complainant was already a troubled young lady but this made things worse by what you did, it is hardly surprising she is now wrestling with demons you leased into her life.

'She expressed a feeling of guilt and shame that she repeated. She has nothing to feel ashamed about but one understands why these feelings arise in a young girl.

'It is not surprising that she is self harming, it is not surprising that her education is being disrupted, her relationship between her and her mother is even more difficult, which is all to be expected when a child has been raped.

'This is an offence for which a custodial sentence is inevitable and it is an immediate custodial sentence. It is a particularly grave offence.'

'Demons': The judge at Preston Crown Court berated Weir for 'leasing demons into her life'

Detective Sergeant Steve Ryder said: 'I am pleased with the jury's decision to find Weir guilty of these offences and the lengthy sentence that has been given.

'I would like to reassure the community of Preston that offences of this type are uncommon and we will always do what we can to bring offenders to justice.

'As with all reports of sexual offences, specially trained officers have been working closely with the victim in this case and we have provided the appropriate support through our partner agencies.'

Weir was also put on the sex offenders' register for life.
