While efforts to find missing Malaysian passenger plane MH370 continue, the families of passengers have begun to receive initial compensation payments of $50,000 (£30,000).

Six Malaysian families and one Chinese family have received the money to date, according to Malaysian deputy foreign minister Hamzah Zainudin.

Zainudin stressed that the government has not yet declared the plane lost, but says talks with 40 more Chinese families are already underway to ascertain they are 
the rightful claimants.

Hamzah heads a committee to support 
the missing passengers' next-of-kin and says full payment to the families - who can claim can claim up three times the initial amount - will be made later.

Under International Civil Aviation Organisation rules, passengers' families can claim up to US$175,000 (£103,000), regardless of fault, in a plane crash.

Malaysia Airlines' insurer, a consortium led by Germany's Allianz, is making the payments.

Flight MH370 veered 
off course during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8 and 
is believed to have crashed into the Indian Ocean far off the west 
Australian coast.

The search area has changed several times, but no sign of the aircraft, or the 239 people aboard, has been found.

Countries involved in the search, including Malaysia, Australia, United States, China, Japan, Britain, South Korea and New Zealand, have carried their own costs to date.

Meanwhile during talks between Malaysia and Australia on cost-sharing for the search, a Malaysian official claimed that both countires would split the bill 50/50.

But Australian Transport Minister Warren Truss declined to say whether the country was considering an even split of the bill for a search that could take months, if not years, and cost tens of millions of dollars.

The government expects to spend 90 million Australian dollars (£49 million) on the search by July 2015.

Countries are continuing to negotiate on how to fund the next phase of the sonar search of almost 56,000 square kilometers (21,600 square miles) of seabed beneath water up to 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) deep.

Countries involved in the search, including Malaysia, Australia, United States, China, Japan, Britain, South Korea and New Zealand, have carried their own costs to date.

But Malaysian government lawmaker Jailani Johari, chairman of Malaysia's Liaison, Communication and Media Committee, told reporters in Kuala Lumpur this week that future costs 'will be shared 50-50' between Malaysia and Australia.

The Australian government has repeatedly said it owes it to families of the passengers and crew aboard Flight 370 to do all it can to solve the mystery of the airliner's disappearance. It has placed no time limit on how long the search will continue.

A Chinese survey ship is mapping the ocean floor ahead of a sonar search for wreckage by specialist deep-sea private contractors. That search is expected to begin in August and take eight to 12 months.

Truss said China, the homeland of most of the missing passengers, was continuing to carry its own costs for the survey work. But China is under no legal obligation to help pay the multimillion-dollar bill for the private contractors.
