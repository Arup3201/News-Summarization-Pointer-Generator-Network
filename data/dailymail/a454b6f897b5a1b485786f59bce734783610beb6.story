Move aside husbands and partners, a new survey has revealed that cheating Australian women are most likely to fantasise about bedding their yoga teachers.

The survey, conducted by the dating website Victoria Milan which was designed for people who are married or in a long term relationship, asked over 4000 women who they fantasise about most.

Surprisingly, 20 per cent of respondents revealed it was their yoga teacher who featured in their bedroom fantasies, while 18 per cent admitted they daydreamed about a colleague or workplace superior.

'A neighbour' was another popular choice amongst women straying from their partners, while an unexpected 10 per cent of votes were also recorded for the option: 'my partner's friend'.

Founder and CEO of Victoria Milan, Sigurd Vedal, said that fantasising about these 'untouchables' was a healthy part of relationships.

His website, which was launched in 2010, now has over five million members looking for and maintaining secret affairs across 33 countries.

'It's healthy and normal to explore these thoughts, so long as we also consider the consequences if we decide to act on them,' Mr Vedal said.

The survey also found that ten per cent of respondents were also still thinking about their ex, while strangely 7 per cent named their brother in law as their most common fantasy.

Apparently it's also men and women in medicine that tickle the fancy of cheating women, with doctors appearing in the top ten fantasies with two per cent of votes.

Six per cent of respondents also listed their physiotherapist as their most common fantasy.
