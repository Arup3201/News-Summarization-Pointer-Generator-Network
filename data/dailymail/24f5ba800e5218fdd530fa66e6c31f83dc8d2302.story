Lovebirds: Royal Parks staff release the pair of reunited Australian black swans on to Queen Mary's Gardens lake, in Regents Park, London

After seven years together, their romance came to an abrupt end last summer when constantÂ  'squabbling' meant they had to be separated.

But a pair of swans is having another go at making love work, as they were released into Regent's Park together.

It is well known that swans mate for life, but the pair of Australian black swans began to concern park staff with their feisty attitude towards each other.

The staff were eventually forced to intervene in the domestic, moving the female to another pond in Queen Mary's Gardens and leaving the male on his own.

The separation clearly affected the male, who was seen searching and calling for his mate after her removal, according to Royal Parks staff.

Andrew Williams, the gardens' 
assistant manager, told the BBC: 'The male and the female tend to mate for life 
so it was a little unusual that they fell out.'

But in spite of their unusual acrimony, he said the couple's return was a success.

He added: 'We've
 had a good release of the swans, with a little bit of a delay looking 
out on to the water, then we stepped in and I think they look very happy
 and very glad to be back to their rightful home.'

The unusual breed of swan was initially 
brought to the UK from Australia in private wildfowl collections but 
many of the birds are thought to have escaped and now breed across the 
country.

But behind their attractive black feathers and red beaks, the birds are said to be much more aggressive than their British relatives.

Dawn Balmer, from the British Trust for Ornithology told the Daily Telegraph in 2009 that the birds were now 'cropping up all over the place'.

He added: 'We have been surprised by the numbers we have found...Some people would be upset if you said black swans might be killed, but others see them as a serious threat to biodiversity. They compete with other species for food and habitat and are quite aggressive.'
