Extremists holding Briton Alan Henning tormented his wife yesterday by sending her a message of him begging for his life.

After months of having her desperate pleas for his release ignored, Barbara Henning was sent an audio file – apparently in response to US attacks on Islamic State forces yesterday.

The 47-year-old father of two was captured by the group’s fanatics last December while delivering aid in Syria. They have threatened to behead him.

The message is thought to be the first time Mrs Henning has heard her taxi driver husband’s voice in almost nine months.

His wife said: 'We are at a loss why those leading Islamic State cannot open their hearts and minds to the facts surrounding Alan's imprisonment and why they continue to threaten his life'

No precise details of the message were released and it was not known if the digital file was recorded before or after the air strikes began.

In a statement, Mrs Henning revealed her husband had been tried by a sharia court in Syria and found ‘innocent’ of spying and to be no threat to Islamic State.

The file is assumed to have been sent to her by email and a statement confirming its existence was released to the media by the Foreign Office. It emerged as:

Mr Henning has been the subject of an increasingly high profile campaign for his release from captivity.

Last week 100 Muslim leaders based in the UK condemned his continued captivity. Over the weekend a string of radical preachers called for his release.

Mrs Henning said last night: ‘An audio file of Alan pleading for his life has just been received by me. I and people representing me continue to reach out to those holding Alan. Islamic State continue to ignore our pleas to open dialogue.

‘I have seen Muslims across the globe question Islamic State over Alan’s fate. The voices of the people have spoken out loud and clear.

‘He was working with Muslims to help the most vulnerable within Syria. Nothing has changed. He went to Syria to help his Muslim friends deliver much needed aid.’

In a statement released by the Foreign Office, she said: ‘We are at a loss why those leading Islamic State cannot open their hearts and minds to the facts surrounding Alan’s imprisonment and why they continue to threaten his life.

‘I have been told that he has been to a Sharia court and found innocent of being a spy and declared to be no threat. I implore Islamic State to abide by the decisions of their own justice system. Please release Alan.’

His plight was revealed in an IS video showing the murder of a fellow British hostage, David Haines.

The extremist group has previously released footage showing the killing of American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff.

Mr Henning and other hostages were thought to be held in a network of tunnels under the IS stronghold of Raqqa, but his brother-in-law Colin Livesey said the US strikes could have forced his captors on the run.

Mr Livesey told ITV News: ‘It scares me. They’ll just run away, they’ll take him with them, and no one knows where he is again.’

Asked if he thought the air campaign had put Mr Henning at greater risk, he said: ‘Yes. I don’t like saying that because it’ll feel like I’m losing faith.’

He added: ‘He’s a loving husband and a loving father to two beautiful kids… he’s just an amazing guy. To miss his own family’s Christmas to do what he’s done, speaks volumes to what kind of man he is.’

Meanwhile, ISIS has released forty nine hostages who were seized by Islamic militants in Iraq have been freed and safely returned to Turkey,

Turkish prime minister Ahmet Davutoglu said the hostages had been returned to Turkey following intense negotiations.

The hostages were seized from the Turkish Consulate in Mosul, Iraq on June 11, when ISIS overran the city in its surge to seize large swathes of Iraq and Syria.

Their release contrasts with the recent beheadings of two US journalists and a British aid worker by the Islamic State group, but it wasn't immediately clear what Turkey had done to secure the safe release of the hostages.

The U.S. and Arab began air strikes on militant targets in Syria overnight.

The airstrikes - which employed U.S. Tomahawk missiles, B1 bombers, F16, F18 and F22 strike fighters and drones - was backed by support from Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, Jordan and the UAE - a coalition of nations that has agreed to assist with the destruction of ISIS.

There was also a separate U.S. attack on a different band of Islamist militants in Syria - the mysterious Al Qaeda-affiliated Khorasan Group, who are said to have been planning an 'imminent attack' on a Western target.

None of Washington's usual Western allies has so far joined the campaign in Syria. Britain, which joined the United States in war in Iraq and Afghanistan last decade, has said it was still considering its options.
