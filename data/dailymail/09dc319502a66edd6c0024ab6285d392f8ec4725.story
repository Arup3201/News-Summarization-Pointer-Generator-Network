Preston Pollard, a 23-year-old man from Texas, got behind the wheel of his Honda on Christmas Eve and set out on a 1,100-mile to visit the family of his ex-girlfriend. He was armed with a gun.

More than 15 hours later, Richard Hutson, 36, was found shot dead and his 55-year-old wife, Mary Lou Hutson, was critically wounded inside their Ocala, Florida, home.

In the early hours of Christmas Day, Pollard was discovered dead inside his car on Interstate 10 from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to his upper torso.

According to police, Pollard was driven by a desire to take revenge on his girlfriend's stepmother after the 18-year-old was unable to join him in Texas for the holidays.

Pollard's father, Stephen Pollard, claimed the 23-year-old was not a violent or 'mean' person.'

Mr Pollard said Preston had purchased a plane ticket for his girlfriend to come to Texas to spend the holidays with him, but when her plans changed, he decided to drive to girl’s home in Florida and get her.

‘Something went wrong,’ Mr Pollard told WFAA. ‘Nobody really knows what happened… They say he opened the door and started shooting. That doesn’t sound very likely to me.

‘Why would he drive all that way to kill somebody? He was driving that way to see his girlfriend.’

According to Preston’s father, the 23-year-old, a recent graduate of Air Force basic training Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland in San Antonio, did not own a gun.

Police say Preston Pollard reached the Hutson family’s home in Marion Oaks just after midnight on Christmas Day.

As Mary Lou Hutson, 55, came to the door, the 23-year-old allegedly opened fire on her, leaving the woman gravely wounded.

He then moved on to her husband, fatally shooting Richard Hutson in the bedroom.

Pollard’s girlfriend said when she heard gunfire in the house, she locked her three nieces and nephews in a bathroom and then jumped out the back window to go for help, according to ConnectAmarillo.

Mary Lou Hutson was rushed to Ocala Regional Medical Center, where she remained in critical condition after undergoing emergency surgery.

Following the shooting, Preston Pollard got back in his blue 2002 Honda Civic car and drove off.

Police spotted his vehicle at around 5.30am about 350 miles away from the crime scene on Interstate 10 in Okaloosa County and attempted to pull him over, prompting Pollard to turn the gun on himself.

‘He came to Marion County for the sole purpose to commit murder,’ said Lauren Lettelier, a spokeswoman with the Marion County Sheriff’s Department in Ocala. ‘And he wanted to kill the wife.’
