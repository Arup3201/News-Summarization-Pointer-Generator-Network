These incredible images were captured when a professional photographer decided to quit his day job and travel 13,000 miles across the United States.

Shane Black took around 10,000 beautiful images across 32 states capturing some of the country's best known natural landmarks in exquisite detail.

The pictures are stunning in their own right but Mr Black took things one step further by taking multiple images of the same view and combining them to create a dazzling timelapse video.

The 26-year-old, from Ohio, quit his job of six years and decided to spend a total of two months travelling across his home country, funding it entirely by teaching photography workshops in a few select cities along the way.

Amazingly Shane was new to timelapse techniques when he set out on his epic adventure, but that didn't stop him producing some truly inspiring results.

The result it entitled Adventure Is Calling and whisks sofa travellers across the 32 states, calling in at 13 national parks to soak up pink sunrises, oranges sunsets and a spectacular array of celestial delights at night.
