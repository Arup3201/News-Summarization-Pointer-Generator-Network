The red poppy, the symbol of remembrance, is disappearing from British fields as it has become one of the nation’s fastest declining plant species.

Powerful new herbicides and modern farming techniques have seen it almost completely wiped from fields, a study has found.

The flower is now only found on rough ground, hedgerows and in gardens.

Disappearing from British fields: The red poppy has become one of the nation's fastest declining plant species

Plantlife, which campaigns for the protection of wild plants, found that the poppy is one of more than 500 wild flowers that are now considered threatened or rare in England.

Nicola Hutchinson, who wrote the report, said: ‘Despite its iconic status, our symbol of remembrance could face its own battle if action isn’t taken.

‘As Britain prepares to mark the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War, the sad fact is that the much loved red poppy now belongs to our fastest declining group of plants.

‘England’s farmland is rapidly becoming the domain of a few species where once there was abundant diversity, with increased intensification resulting in wild flowers such as poppy being squeezed out of the landscape.

Iconic: The flower is widely recognised as the symbol of remembrance

‘Of the 1,556 flowers in the British flora, 580 are considered threatened or rare in England. As they disappear, so the colour is wiped from our countryside.

The England Farmland Report warned that on average one species of flower is lost from each county every year.

‘Corn buttercups, purple milk vetch, red hemp nettle and Venus looking glass are vanishing; those left cling on to fragments of a countryside that is becoming nothing more than green concrete,’ it said.

Plantlife is calling for the European Union common agricultural policy (CAP) to include increased protections for wild flowers.

‘When the First World War broke out, farmland flowers like poppies, corn buttercups and purple milk vetch were abundant across Britain. Today they are still amongst our most loved species but belong to our most threatened group of flowers,’ the report said.

‘Many species have gone from prolific to rare within a few decades. Across the country we are losing species that have been locally present for centuries.

‘Changes in farming practices, including the increased use of herbicides and inorganic fertilisers, breeding of more competitive crop varieties, seed-cleaning and changes from predominately spring sown cropping to autumn cropping, have taken their toll.

‘We hope the government will make the right decision on CAP and agri-environment funding.

‘Negotiations within the EU have reached a tipping point and the next Common Agricultural Policy is being settled over the forthcoming months. It is imperative that environment measures within the Rural Development Programme for England protect this unrivalled natural and cultural heritage.’
