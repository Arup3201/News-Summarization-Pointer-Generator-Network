A northern New Mexico sheriff's deputy shot and killed a fellow deputy at a hotel Tuesday after transporting a prisoner to Arizona, authorities said.

The shooting took place just after midnight at the Hotel Encanto in the southern New Mexico city of Las Cruces, police said.

Officials said the two Santa Fe County deputies—Tai Chan, 27, and Jeremy Martin, 29—had dropped off the prisoner and were heading back to Santa Fe, nearly 300 miles from the hotel, Albuquerque Journal reported.

The two had been drinking at the Dublin's Street Pub and started arguing, police said.

They headed back to their room and, at some point, the argument got even more heated.

That's when Chan allegedly fired several rounds from a semi-automatic gun as Martin ran away toward the elevator, cops said. 

Martin was bleeding heavily outside the elevator in the lobby with several shots in his back and arms. He was rushed to Mountain View Regional Medical Center, where he died. 

Martin, who was married and had three children, had been been a deputy for two years.

Detectives found Chan in a stairwell near the roof of Hotel Encanto.

Chan, who had four years in the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office, was being questioned Tuesday morning.

Martin's wife, Sarah Martin, told the Journal he 'was a great dad, a great husband, a family guy, well grounded.

'I am still kind of processing,' said Sarah Martin, with whom the deputy had three children ages 4, 9, and 11.

'I think everyone is quite shocked … he (Jeremy) was a self-sacrificing kind of a person and put everyone else first,' she told the newspaper. 'He was very well-balanced as far as family and career.

'He had a big heart and gave everyone the benefit of the doubt.'

Santa Fe County Sheriff Robert Garcia said his department was grieving and that he was at a loss for words, describing the shooting as a 'major shock.'

'I have grief counselors or crisis counselors here now meeting with a lot of my personnel, but it's a grieving law enforcement agency,' Garcia said.

'In this line of work, you worry about something like this happening daily, but not from one deputy to another,' he told the Los Angeles Times.

'I haven't dealt with anything in my 34-year career like this.'

Garcia told the Times that the deputies didn't usually work together, but he was unaware of any animosity between them.

'There was nothing to ever indicate that something like this would ever take place,' Garcia told the newspaper.

'Now I have an agency that needs to support each other through the grieving process.'
