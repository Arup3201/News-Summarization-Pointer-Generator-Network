Helder Pina was jailed for three years and banned from driving for four after he admitted causing death by dangerous driving on August 1 last year

A Portuguese driver who killed a British grandfather after crashing into him at more than double the speed limit has been jailed.

Helder Pina claimed he was not used to driving on the left when he ploughed into Christopher Willmott last August.

The grandfather, 48, died after being catapulted 187ft (57m) into the air when he was struck by Pina's car.

The 34-year-old Portuguese immigrant, who had  arrived in Britain just three weeks earlier, had been travelling at between 63mph and 67mph when he lost control as he attempted to overtake a group of cyclists, a court heard.

Pina's new Peugeot 206 careened off the road straight into  Mr Willmott who as waiting for a taxi at 1.30am on August 1.

On Monday Pina was jailed for three years and banned from driving for four years after he admitted causing death by dangerous driving at Worcester Crown Court. The family of Mr Willmott has since blasted the 'disgusting' sentence.

Judge Michael Cullum told Pina the crash was 'entirely' his fault which had caused the death of a 'hard working and devoted family man.'

The court heard Mr Willmott, of Worcester, was with a couple and their eight-year-old son who had all waiting for a taxi after returning from night fishing on the Worcester canal.

His friend Thomas Towers managed to pull partner Linda Finch and their young son to safety but Mr Willmott was unable to get out of the way.

A court heard the Peugeot hit the kerb and lost a wheel before it careered into Mr Willmott at between 63mph and 67mph.

Shocking CCTV footage of the crash, which was aired in court, showed the skilled kitchen fitter being 'catapulted' along the road in Blackpole, Worcester.

Pina then sped across a junction where he struck a lamppost before eventually coming to a halt 984ft (300m) away.

The court heard Pina had passed his test in Portugal in 2012 but had not driven on the left-hand side of the road until he bought the Peugeot three weeks before the crash.

Shockingly, he was stopped by police on the first night he had driven it because he was swerving all over the road.

Prosecutor Iain Willis said Pina, of Worcester, told officers he was having difficulty with the controls and gear stick being on a different side.

He told the court his inexperience behind the wheel could have contributed to the crash.

Pina had been working at Worcester Bosch between 3.30pm and 1am and was giving work-mate Elio Soares a lift home at the time of the crash.

Mr Soares, who had minor injuries, told police he shouted at his colleague to brake but he just held on to the wheel as the car 'zig-zagged' across the road.

Pina first arrived from Portugal in 2007 and settled in the UK permanently in 2012.

Nicholas Berry, defending, said he stayed at the scene and helped to call ambulance after the

crash.

He added: 'There is nothing I can sensibly say to express the sorry he feels for the tragic events.' 

Speaking after the hearing, Mr Willmott's family hit out at the three-year sentence - branding it 'disgusting'.

Tributes left at the scene to the father-of-three, Mr Willmott, whose family hit out at Pina's three-year sentence after the sentencing claiming it was much too short

Ex-wife Karen Willmott, 46, said: 'To drive like that and to take someone's life and then to be allowed out in 18 months, it's not enough.

'I thought it (the sentence) was disgusting.' 

His brother Dave Willmott, 46, added: 'This is not going to make it any easier. I personally don't think we have had justice today.'

Mr Willmott leaves behind three children, Andrew, 27, Carley, 25 and Danielle, 21.

He had planned to stop night fishing at 10pm but tragically stayed later because he caught a large 10lb fish.

Speaking last year, his daughter Danielle said: 'He said it was the best thing I have ever done having the kids and his grandkids.

'He was always smiling, laughing and joking and he would do anything for anybody. He was one of the best blokes, he wouldn't hurt a fly

'I don't think I want to get married ever because he's not there to walk me down the aisle. He was a very proud dad.'
