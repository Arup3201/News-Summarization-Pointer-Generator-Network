TV producer Tim Robinson who is suing Marks and Spencer after wrongly being accused of shoplifting from one of their stores 

A former BBC TV producer is to sue Marks and Spencer for £100,000 after he was wrongly accused of shoplifting and marched through one of their stores in handcuffs.

Award winning Tim Robinson, 51, who has worked on programmes such as Timewatch and Digging for Britain, was then locked in a police cell for six hours as police investigated claims he had stolen pork chops.

Now the Oxford graduate, who was released without charge, is claiming compensation of £100,000 for false imprisonment, defamation, emotional distress and mental suffering.

He is also claiming back all the money he believes he spent at the store close to his home over the past 13 years, together with £20,000 in interest.

Private security guards approached Mr Robinson as he shopped at the Camden Town branch of Marks and Spencer in North London in May.

He was then taken to the stairwell in front of neighbours where he claims two 'threatening and rude' security staff accused him of stealing £60 worth of peppered steak and a barrel of pork over two weeks previously.

They then called the police and allegedly claimed Mr Robinson was being 'physically threatening'.

But it was only when police compared his photo from security cameras with the meat thief that they spotted the blunder.

Mr Robinson today said: 'I feel appalled at how I was treated. I was just wandering through the shop - it's very close to my house. A security guard came up to me and said could he have have a word with me.

'He showed me a still of myself and said is this you? He said to come to the back of the shop and we'll talk about it. His manner was threatening.

'They said I had stolen food from the shop. I said I had no idea what they were talking about. They had an array of stills with them but they only showed me two of myself taken on a different date.

'They had these stills of the criminal with different coloured hair and at least fifteen years younger. The only similarity is that we're both male, white and slim. It's unbelievable. What on earth were they doing putting photographs of me and mixing them up with photographs of a criminal?'

He added: 'They didn't even have the decency to take me somewhere private. They said I would have time to look at the photographs later. They were very threatening and very rude.

'The first thing the policeman said was "why did you tell me this is an emergency? He isn't physically threatening". 

'The police said I could have an interview there and then but I said I wasn't prepared to say anything until a solicitor was there.

'I was handcuffed and marched through the shop in front of everyone, in front of my neighbours. I was made to get into the police van on Camden High Street.

'I was put into the back of the police van with the grille, all my belongings taken. And then they took a mug shot.'

Mr Robinson says he shopped in the Camden Town branch of Marks and Spencer for over 12 years and is also claiming back all of the money he claims he has spent at the store 

Mr Robinson's partner, who is a City lawyer then turned up at the police station where he was told he had been identified as a shoplifter.

He explained: 'I was really shocked, I actually burst into tears when I spoke to the duty solicitor.

'She said that the police told her they had incontrovertible evidence that I committed this crime. She was saying that it would be better to admit to the crime. I thought I was having some kind of memory lapse. I thought I was bonkers.'

But he added he was only let go when officers re-examined the photos of him and the thief and realised they had the wrong man and said: 'The police didn't look carefully enough at the photographs. It clearly wasn't me.

'She apologised afterwards after it and said that she had never seen anything like this.

'The writ is composed of three main parts, defamation, false imprisonment, and basically an abuse of trust.

'I'm an Oxford graduate, I'm in a very fortunate position. Just imagine what could have happened to a person without these sorts of advantages.

'I'm just determined this doesn't happen to someone else. I want M&S to change the way they operate.'

A spokeswoman for Marks and Spencer said: 'As this is part of ongoing legal proceedings, it would be inappropriate for M&S to provide any comment at this time.'

A Camden Police spokesman confirmed they were called to the shop on May 19 after staff reported they had found believed responsible for thefts on May 2.

The spokesman added : 'A 51-year-old man was taken to a north London police station where he was interviewed under caution. No further action was taken on the man.'
