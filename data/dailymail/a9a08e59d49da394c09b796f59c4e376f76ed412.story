Former Chelsea and Arsenal left back Ashley Cole took some time off from playing for Roma to take on a different challenge as he faced up to the silky skills of  freestyler Sean Garnier.

Garnier had to quit professional football in his native France due to injuries but has since become one of the most famous freestylers in the world and in 2008 he won the inaugural Red Bull Street Style World Finals.

With his feet moving so quickly they were almost a blur, Cole had to keep his eyes firmly on the ball as Garnier strutted his stuff when the two met this weekend.

The 33-year-old, who has 107 England caps, showed he's lost none of his defensive nous as he let his French opponent  perform his mesmerising tricks before nipping in to dispossess him when the opportunity arose.

Shortly before making the tackle, Cole joked, 'I don't want to hurt you' while he watched Garnier flick the ball right and left.

The ex-England international took the applause as he ended up with the ball, but he may be relieved at getting back to his day job and facing up to more conventional opponents when he next lines up for Roma.

The left back has made seven appearances for the Italian side since joining from Chelsea this summer
