Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has said that his government will never develop nuclear weapons and that he has full authority to negotiate a nuclear deal with the West.

Rouhani also said that the tone of a letter he received recently from President Obama, in an exchange of messages between the two leaders, was 'positive and constructive.'

'It could be subtle and tiny steps for a very important future,' he said.

President Rouhani said that a recent exchange of messages with President Obama could prove to be 'subtle and tiny steps' towards better relations in the future

The exchange between the two leaders could set the stage for the first meeting between a U.S. and Iranian leader since Iran's 1979 revolution.

The recently elected leader was speaking to NBC News anchor-at-large Ann Curry in Tehran on Wednesday.  

Through an interpreter, Rouhani told Curry that his administration will never develop nuclear weapons and that he has full authority to make a deal with the West on the disputed atomic program.

'In its nuclear program, this government enters with full power and has complete authority,' he said.

Asked whether Iran would ever build a nuclear weapon, Rouhani noted that the country has repeatedly pledged that 'under no circumstances would we seek any weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons, nor will we ever.'

'We have never pursued or sought a nuclear bomb, and we are not going to do so,' he said. 'We solely are looking for peaceful nuclear technology.'

Rouhani will make his first appearance 
on the world stage as president next week at the United Nations General 
Assembly in New York.

U.S. officials are hoping for more signs that he will defrost relations with the West and take a more moderate line in the next negotiations on Iran's nuclear program.

The U.S. and its allies suspect Iran of seeking a nuclear weapons capability.

Tehran says its nuclear program is purely for peaceful purposes, but Israel regards it as a threat to its existence and refuses to rule out military action.

With the election of an apparently more pragmatic president in the British-educated moderate Rouhani, it has been hoped Western countries might see a better chance for diplomacy and strike a deal to curb Iran’s uranium enrichment program and avoid any conflict.

The last meeting between an American and Iranian leader was in 1977 when President Carter met Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said there were no current plans for Obama to meet Rouhani at the General Assembly.

‘I think it's fair to say that the president believes there is an opportunity for diplomacy when it comes to the issues that have presented challenges to the United States and our allies with regards to Iran,’ he said. ‘And we hope that the Iranian government takes advantage of this opportunity.’

Carney said the U.S. will test Rouhani's assertions that he wants to improve relations with the international community.

He also noted that Obama too had confirmed the exchange of letters with Rouhani. In his letter, Obama indicated that the U.S. was ready to resolve the nuclear issue in a way that would allow Iran to demonstrate that its program was exclusively for peaceful purposes, Carney said.

‘The letter also conveyed the need to act with a sense of urgency to address this issue because as we have long said, the window of opportunity for resolving this diplomatically is open, but it will not remain open indefinitely,’ Carney said.

Rouhani said the letter from Obama raised some issues the U.S. president was concerned about and that he had responded to the points Obama raised.

‘From my point of view, the tone of the letter was positive and constructive,’ Rouhani said, adding that world leaders should not be under the influence of pressure groups.
