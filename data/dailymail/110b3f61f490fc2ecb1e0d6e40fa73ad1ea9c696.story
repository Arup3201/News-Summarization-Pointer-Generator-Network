Back at home, his colleagues were campaigning furiously  in the final hours before their party’s crucial by-election.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage, meanwhile, seemed more interested in a different kind of party as he enjoyed a boozy night in the Mediterranean.

But the 50-year-old was less than happy when pictures emerged of him returning to his hotel hand in hand with a blonde woman just before 4am.

Yesterday, as he returned from the trip, Mr Farage angrily dismissed allegations of inappropriate behaviour as ‘fluff and nonsense’, saying: ‘I didn’t go to bed with her.’

Married Mr Farage had jetted off to Malta to speak at a travel conference, despite it being the last days of campaigning in the crucial Newark by-election where Ukip had hoped to win its first seat in Westminster.

While party activists were busy campaigning in the Nottinghamshire constituency, Mr Farage was more than 1,500 miles away at a gala dinner the night before his speech.

After the meal, Mr Farage and  the travel industry delegates went  out drinking, before ending the night  in a penthouse bar in the island’s  tallest building.

Fiona Jeffery, a former travel boss, took to Twitter to share a picture of the Ukip leader looking worse for wear and surrounded by a group of blonde women, adding the caption: ‘Nigel Farage gets up close to travel industry.’

Mr Farage was then photographed returning to his five-star hotel at  3:42am, holding hands with tourism boss Ande Soteri.

Last night Mr Farage insisted  that he had just been helping  the 49-year-old, who was walking with the aid of a crutch, to  make her way back to the hotel from the bar.

Upset: Mr Farage looked tired and under strain as he removed a black suitcase from the boot of his car after saying any suggestion that he did anything improper is 'so ridiculous'

He said: ‘The next time I see  a disabled
 person I am just  ignoring them. She is a seriously disabled woman on a
 crutch  and I actually helped her by  carrying her bag.

‘The allegations are just  fluff and nonsense. She is a  disabled woman who I helped back to the hotel.’

Asked if he had met her before, he said: ‘I haven’t even got her phone number.’

A
 Ukip press officer added:  ‘This is utterly, utterly ludicrous. This 
woman walks with a  stick and he was helping her to the front door of a
 hotel. It is disgusting mischief-making [to suggest otherwise].’

As Mr Farage gave his speech at the conference on Wednesday, just hours after his pre-dawn partying came to an end, he joked to delegates that he had been up for most of the night drinking.

He also appeared in a spoof party election broadcast shown at the conference for the ‘No-kip’ party, in which he said: ‘I’ve always thought sleep to be a  terrible, shocking, awful waste  of time. Evenings? What are they for? They’re for the excessive consumption of alcohol.'

Claims: Former Ukip MEP Nikki Sinclaire, left, accused Mr 
Farage in the European Parliament of paying both his wife and 'former 
mistress' Annabelle Fuller using taxpayers' money. Mr Farage denies 
having an affair

Miss Soteri, who is commercial 
director for the conference organiser, yesterday denied that anything 
improper had happened with Mr Farage.

She said: ‘Yes, I was with Mr Farage. We are staying at the same hotel – there was no impropriety between us.’

MEP Godfrey Bloom, Mr Farage's Brussels flatmate, has claimed the Ukip leader's weakness is women

Mr Farage flew back to the UK and 
returned for half an hour to his home in Kent, which he shares with his 
German second wife Kirsten, before going on to Newark, where voters were
 heading to the polls yesterday.

Mrs Farage, 47, who married him in 1999 and now works as his secretary, refused to comment on the photographs.

The political leader, who has four children from his two marriages, has been accused in the past of having extra-marital relations.

In 2005, reports emerged of him having a seven-times-a-night tryst with a Latvian woman. He denied the claims but was allegedly  presented with a can of 7UP by Ukip members.

In March, former Ukip MEP Nikki Sinclaire challenged the Ukip leader in the European Parliament over accusations that he employs both his wife and alleged ‘former mistress’ Annabelle Fuller on his taxpayer-funded payroll.

Both Mr Farage and Miss Fuller, a Ukip press aide, deny they had an affair, with Mr Farage dismissing the claims as ‘absolute nonsense’.

There had been speculation that Mr Farage would stand as Ukip’s candidate in the Newark by-election, but since he ruled that out he has appeared to have distanced himself from the contest.

However, while enjoying himself in Malta, he continued to post messages on Twitter encouraging party supporters to keep campaigning in the seat.
