The army is soon to announce its new $4 billion camouflage pattern and standard uniform to be worn by its soldiers as it comes under criticism for ‘wasting’ $5 billion on its last uniform which lasted less than a decade.

The billion-dollar experiment to create a universal pattern, known as the Universal Camouflage Pattern, or UCP, is being phased out as the army gets ready to reveal the new uniform.

The army decided to scrap the two traditional camouflage uniforms that had long been used by the military - one meant for woodland environments, another for the desert – in favour of the UCP, which they said could be worn anywhere and blend in with any environment.  

Out with the old: The army's UCP grey uniform is being scrapped after less than 10 years

'Blends into a parking lot': Critics say the pattern of the UCP does not work in combat areas

However, after less than 10 years in use, soldiers and critics say the UCP was a waste of money.

In 2009, Congress responded to soldiers’ concerns about the current combat uniform which they indicated provides ineffective camouflage given the environment in Afghanistan.

The result was the MultiCam uniform, which is currently being worn by US troops in Afghanistan.

But the uniform was only meant to be an interim substitution for the UCP, which is still the army’s official uniform and the one worn by all soldiers who are not overseas.

Temporary solution: The MultiCam uniform was introduced in 2009 after soldiers complained their UCP uniform did not blend into the Afghani environment

Put to good use: The MultiCam is the uniform currently being used by troops in Afghanistan because it blends into the environment better than the UCP

Former Army Officer Matt Gallagher said during his 15-month deployment to Iraq from 2007-2009, he became well acquainted with the shortfalls of the universal camouflage pattern, according to The Daily Beast.

In an attempt to blend in with all kinds of environments, the pattern instead wound up sticking out everywhere, its grey, gravel design that only a help to soldiers hoping to blend in with a parking lot.

Army Sergeant Matt Pelak laughs at the mention of the universal camouflage pattern.

‘It is one of the things that drives me craziest about the army I have to admit,’ he told The Daily Beast. We started rolling it out in 2005 and everyone was baffled by it.’

While Pelak admits there were some upsides to the design, such as easy-to-access pockets, his complaints outweighed the positives.

‘Even currently, in my unit, we wear the normal uniform, the UCP when we’re back on base, but when we go in the field we wear MultiCam,’ he said. ‘We have to carry two uniforms around, one that functions properly and one that’s merely administrative.’

Soldiers day they have to carry two different uniforms at the moment - one that functions properly and one that¿s merely administrative

For the new, as-yet-unreleased uniform, the army solicited designs from companies for patterns with three variations, one for the desert, another for woodlands and jungles and a third, traditional semi-wooded pattern similar to the one currently used by soldiers in Afghanistan.

After several rounds of testing, four patterns with three variations for each, from companies in New York, Virginia and Alaska were submitted to the army to choose a winner.

The winner has yet to be announced.

Last year, the Government Accountability Office, a federal watchdog agency, issued a report about the army spending $5 billion on the UCP uniforms and field equipment, only to spend an estimated $4 billion on the new design. 

The Natick Army Soldier Systems Center conducted two studies on the UCP - once in 2006 and again in 2009 - both times finding that the UCP¿s performance came up short

The Natick Army Soldier Systems Center, which does research and development on things like food, clothing, shelter for the military, conducted two studies on the UCP - once in 2006 and again in 2009 - both times finding that the UCP’s performance came up short when compared to other, more popular camouflages, like the Marine Corps desert pattern or the MultiCam.

Whether the current quest for the consummate camouflage will prove time and money well spent or yet another waste remains to be seen.

According to Pelak, the soliders are still ‘stuck with a uniform we can’t wear in the field’.
