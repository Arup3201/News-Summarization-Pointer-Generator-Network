It is the phenomenon that has changed our lives, seeing us pause to snap photos of ourselves at any 'reasonable' moment – while eating, meeting friends or even lying in bed.

But now, it seems, the selfie is taking over the places where we stay on holiday.

Say cheese: The Selfie is increasingly taking over the world of travel

Hotels – from the beaches of the Caribbean to the distant shores of Australia – are adding their weight to the selfie craze, encouraging guests (or would-be guests) to turn their cameras on themselves in order to make the most of their stays – and to win prizes.

For example, the La Concha Resort in Puerto Rico is currently promoting its ‘Take A Selfie Adventure Package’. Available between May and August, the deal costs from $179 per night (£106), and includes discounts on visits to sites like the Bacardi rum distillery.

Guests are encouraged to reel off a string of selfies at locations such as the island’s 16th century Fort San Felipe del Morro – in the hope that they will ‘tag in’ the hotel using its Twitter handle, or talk about it on other social media sites.

In return, they can win further nights of accommodation.

The hotel will select one of the submitted selfies for each of the four months of the promotion, with each winning ‘photographer’ earning another three-night stay.

The hotel has even posted instructions to get guests in the selfie-snapping mood.

‘Be creative when taking your selfie,’ it advises. ‘Tag your post with ‘La Concha Resort’ on Facebook, Instagram or Twitter (@laconcharesort).’

It is not alone in embracing this modern trend.

Guests at forward-thinking hotels can win extra nights if they tag their accommodation into their snaps

Over in 
Portland, the biggest city in the US state of Oregon, the Hotel Modera 
is holding a ‘selfie competition’ during May.

Guests who have already 
made a booking at this boutique property are being asked to submit 
selfies for the chance to win another one-night stay at a later date, or
 dinner for two at the hotel’s restaurant Nel Centro.

The trend has also even crossed to the opposite side of the planet.

The 1888 Hotel, in the Pyrmont district of Sydney, is so in thrall to the me-and-my-cameraphone concept that it announces: ‘We’re the world’s first Instagram hotel!’ on the front page of its website.

‘1888 is the place to Instagram it all,’ it declares.

It backs up this boast with its ‘Selfie Space’ – a portion of the lobby where guests are requested to snap their own smiling faces, and tag them '#1888Hotel'.

Pictures posted to Instagram immediately appear on big screens near the check-in desks.

Fans of Instagram can even expect special treatment. Instagram users with over 10,000 followers are entitled to a free stay at the hotel any time before the end of the year.

Other users can win a night’s stay if they take a striking photo and tag in the hotel.
