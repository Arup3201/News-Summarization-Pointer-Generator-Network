The teacher who was jailed in August for having sex with four of her students at her home and videotaping it has appeared on Anderson Cooper with her husband to defend her actions.

Brittni Colleps, 28, from Texas, spoke from jail where she is serving five years for 16 counts of having improper relationships with students as her husband sat in the studio with Cooper and his special cohost of the day Nancy Grace.

The former English teacher at the Kennedale High School has previously spoken out about the incident, saying she is the victim in the case because the students, who were all aged 18, conspired to film their sex romp without her consent and then distributed the footage.

Colleps' husband Christopher, an Army specialist who was away when his wife was having sex with students in May 2011, said he still loves the mother of his three children and has even blamed himself for driving her to commit adultery.

Speaking to Anderson Cooper, he said: 'I stand by my wife 100 per cent because as a Christian and believing in God, the bible says I have to love my wife unconditionally as Jesus loved the church.

'We didn't come on here for a bash fest, we came on the show to show how god has fixed our broken marriage. I didn't do the right things as the spiritual leader in my home.

'I blame myself for this situation as I committed adultery before she did. None of us are perfect, all of us are broken people, but if we choose to go back to God and put it in his hands, he will forgive us.'

Responding to Anderson Cooper's question as to what she was thinking by carrying out the sex acts with her students, Brittni Colleps said from jail: 'At the time, I really wasn't thinking, I was at a really dark point in my life and there were a lot of other problems going on at the time. I had a lapse of reality and made some bad choices.'

When the CNN anchor asked her about the 'pages and pages of texts' she had sent to students, some of which were sent while they were sitting in the classroom with her, she said: 'It wasn't the way it was made out to be, the whole situation lasted over a month and they made it seem like it was the entire school year. It wasn't that at all, it was just at the end of the year.'

Nancy Grace joined in and described the messages as 'nasty' and quoted some of them as saying: 'Oh yeah, f*** that p****. Your c*** feels so good in my wet p****'

The mother-of-three refused to comment at this point, only to say her case was on appeal which she said she would obviously like to win.

'I accept responsibility for the things I have done wrong and I know people have negative opinions of me but they are not me or who I am and I know I am a changed and better person.'

The case against Colleps has garnered national attention, as inappropriate student-teacher relationships have been on the rise across the U.S.

For Colleps, it all began with an innocuous text message to a student, asking what time a school game was scheduled to start - but it soon escalated into sexting and at one time Colleps and the unidentified student were exchanging as many as 100 sexually explicit texts a day.

Shamed: There were no rape charges brought against Colleps because all the students involved were over the age of 18

The lewd communication included messages like, 'I'm an anything goes in sex kinda girl' and 'I like pullin' hair, bitin', scratchin', spanking, I even like being choked,' according to Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth Beach.

Then in April 2011, Colleps invited this student to come to her home to watch a movie and the two had sex. The student returned to her home on at least four occasions to have sex.

In May, he invited three friends from the football team to her home, while her husband and three children were away.

According to prosecutors, the teacher stripped down to her lingerie, displayed an array of sex toys and escorted the four young men to her bedroom for a group sex session.

Victim? Brittni Colleps told ABC's 20/20 that the students, who were all aged 18, conspired to film their sex romp without her consent

Not to blame: Colleps insists she is not a sexual predator, in an interview with ABC's 20/20

According to video footage, taken by 
one of the students, 'she's performing one sex act on one student, and 
she is simultaneously performing another sex act on another student, and
 she has farmed out her kids for the night so that she can have four 
students in, and engage in what is more or less an orgy,' Beach 
explained.

After the encounter, the student began circulating the footage and it made its way to the school's administration.

Because
 the students were of consenting age, there were no rape charges but 
Texas law prohibits an inappropriate relationship between a student and 
teacher.

At her trial, three of the students testified that they didn't believe she did nothing wrong and that they weren't victims.

'These
 were not boys these were not children. These were grown men who 
connived, conspired and worked with each other to be with this woman,' 
Colleps' attorney Lex Johnston had said at her trial.

Colleps said earlier: 'I felt like I was victimized in that video, because I did not, I never gave my consent for it,' in an interview with ABC's 20/20.

'I'm not trying to say that it's not wrong or immoral for a teacher to have a sexual relationship with her students  ... but I don't think that in this situation when they were legal, consenting adults - it should not affect me or anyone else legally.' 

'In no way, shape or form was I ever preying on anybody. I never coerced anybody to do anything, I never bribed anybody to do anything, I didn't offered grades in exchange for anything.'

Colleps' husband Christopher has experienced a roller-coaster ride of emotions since discovering his wife was cheating, in addition to the ensuing criminal case - telling 20/20 that learning of her betrayal was the 'toughest thing I've ever had to hear.'

But the 32-year-old, who testified that he and his wife had engaged in group sex on previous occasions, says he still loves Colleps and he asked the jury to spare his wife from jail.

'I love her with every part of my heart, every ounce of my being,' he told the jury.

Guilty: Brittni Colleps was convicted on 16 counts of having improper relationships with students

'I'm asking that you give her probation... because it's not mine or my children's fault.'

Christopher was away at Louisiana’s Fort Polk when his wife was having sex with her students.

In the 20/20 interview, the cuckold said that dealing with the aftermath of this affair will be punishment enough for his wife.

'When our children get old enough, she has to look them in the eye and tell them what she did. That is punishment,' he said. 

Similarly, Colleps mother asked the jury to not sentence Brittni to jail, for the sake of her family. 

'I'm asking you to have mercy for her kids cause they need their mom.'

Despite her family's pleas, she was 
sentenced to five years in prison without parole.

For Colleps, it all began with an innocuous text message to a student, asking what time a school game was scheduled to start - but it soon escalated into sexting and at one time Colleps and the unidentified student were exchanging as many as 100 sexually explicit texts a day.

The lewd communication included messages like, 'I'm an anything goes in sex kinda girl' and 'I like pullin' hair, bitin', scratchin', spanking, I even like being choked,' according to Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth Beach, who also spoke to 20/20.
