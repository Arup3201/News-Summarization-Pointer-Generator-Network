She is Essex's curviest glamour girl and she loves showing off her hourglass figure.

Jessica Wright has been the body and face of lingerie brand Alexis Smith for two years.

And today the brand has released two exclusive new shots of its cheeky animal print design, just in time for Christmas.

Pooch power: The TOWIE star unleashed her inner wild thing in the new leopard-print lingerie

Pout perfection: Jessica has perfected her pose

Posing in a leopard print padded bra 
from the autumn/winter range the 27-year-old smoulders as she strikes a 
pose for the camera and cuddles up to a tiny terrier.

The brand specialises in larger cup sizes for girls with small backs like Jess.

Alexis Smith said: 'The ‘Leopard Print’ set rightly encapsulates the different facets of 
femininity by beautifully infusing glamour, seduction and elegance.

'With a seductive but elegant plunge line and slightly more coverage on 
the cup, the silk bow in the centre of the bra provides those little 
finishing touches which designer Alexis Smith is legendary for.

'Teamed 
up with the ‘Leopard Print Thong’ this set will become a popular 
timeless addition to your lingerie collection.'

Jessica Wright has returned as the face of Alexis Smith as they launch a new range of underwear which hit New Look online last month

The lingerie brand, which launched two years ago, is designed for girls with big cup sizes and small backs

The designs are now available on New Look's website as well as in Jessica's own Essex boutique.

'New Look is one of the UK's leading fashion retailers and both Alexis Smith and New Look share the same fashion forward customers,' said Alexis.

Jessica added: 'I am proud to be the "face" of Alexis Smith, it's fast becoming the must have lingerie brand.

'The
Alexis Smith collection is glamorous and sexy but also fits well and is
so comfortable to wear. It’s the best selling brand in my lingerie 
boutique, With Love Jessica!'
