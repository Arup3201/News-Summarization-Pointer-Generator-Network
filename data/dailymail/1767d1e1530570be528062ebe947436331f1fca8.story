A battle dress belonging to an ancient Siberian knight in bony armour has been unearthed in Russia.

The Bronze Age warlord's protective garb was made entirely of bone, and was found in 'perfect condition' after being secreted for between 3,500 and 3,900 years.

Archeologists say the battle outfit may have been a war trophy, as it was not buried in a grave with the 'elite' warrior for whom it was created.

Perfect condition: The Bronze Age warlord's protective garb was made entirely of bone, and was found in 'perfect condition' after being secreted for between 3,500 and 3,900 years

Protective: The armour would have 'given good protection from weapons that were used at the time - bone and stone arrowheads, bronze knives, spears tipped with bronze, and bronze axes', experts said

It is believed to have been made from the bones of elk, deer and horse - though checks are still being conducted.

'The armour could have been a gift, or an exchange, or was perhaps the spoils of war,' reported The Siberian Times.

Boris Konikov, curator of excavations, said: 'Such armour was highly valued. It was more precious than life itself, because it saved life.'

The armour is being cleaned and restored to its original form after being found at a site near the Irtysh River in Omsk. 'We hope to reconstruct an exact copy,' he said.

Bone of contention: But a bone of contention between experts is why as such a precious asset it was buried

A bone of contention between experts is why such a precious asset  was buried.

Scientist Yury Gerasimov, a research fellow of the Omsk branch of the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography, said: 'While there is no indication that the place of discovery of the armour was a place of worship, it is very likely.

'Armour had great material value. There was no sense to dig it in the ground or hide it for a long time - because the fixings and the bones would be ruined.

'Such armour needs constant care.

'So at the moment we can only fantasise as to who dug it into the ground and for what purpose. Was it some ritual or sacrifice? We do not know yet.'

Despite this, he is certain that the armour belonged to a 'hero', an 'elite warrior who knew special methods of battle'.

Big dig: The magnificent armour was found during an archeological dig ahead of the construction of a five star hotel in the west Siberian city of Omsk

Complex of monuments: The archeological site where the armour was found includes a complex of monuments belonging to different epochs
