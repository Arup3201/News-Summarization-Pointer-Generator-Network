A distraught pet owner hopes his beloved parrot which whistles Monty Python’s Always Look On The Bright Side of Life has not 'ceased to be' after it was dramatically stolen.

Talented Jasper, a 20-year-old African Grey, also repeats his owner’s name and greets people with 'good morning' or 'good night' and 'go careful'.

Police have launched an investigation after the pet was taken from his cage outside his owner Richard Bonnett’s home last Friday.

Search: Pet parrot Jasper whistles Monty Python's 'Always Look On The Bright Side of Life' and his distraught owner hopes someone will hear the stolen bird singing it

And the student nurse, 33, has appealed for people in Lincolnshire to listen out for Jasper whistling the Monty Python song made famous by the hit 1979 comedy film ‘Life of Brian.’

'It does sound like something out of a Monty Python sketch but the serious side of this is that someone has stolen a much loved family pet and we are really worried,' he said.

'We had him from a chick and tried to teach him lots of tunes but the only one which has stuck is "Always Look On The Bright Side of Life".

'Someone is bound to hear him whistling it because he whistles it all the time, he can’t help it.

'He also says my name "Richard", my dad’s name "John" and copies my mum, Jean, who always says "go careful" whenever someone goes out the house.'

Jasper, who is worth several hundred pounds, was taken from his cage after Richard put him in the back garden in Stickney, near Boston, when it was warm weather.

Mr Bonnett added: 'My mum had gone to my sister’s house in Sibsey and on nice days we always left Jasper in his cage in our back garden which is out of sight of the road.

'We think he was taken at about at about 12:30pm.

'We suspect that he has been stolen to order by someone hoping to sell him on.

'He was probably stuffed in a sack and taken to god where knows where.

'We are all extremely upset about what’s happened but especially my dad as he was his pet before I started looking after him.

'He is tame for me and my dad but is unlikely to take to anyone else as he’s been in my family for 20 years.'

The iconic Parrot sketch became one of the most famous routines by Monty Python.

The sketch involved John Cleese complaining to Michael Palin about being sold a dead parrot.

As Cleese becomes increasingly irate he lists a string of phrases to explain the bird’s demise - including 'this bird is no more', 'it is deceased', 'this is an ex-parrot'.

Lincolnshire Police are now appealing for information about Jasper’s whereabouts and said they were increasingly worried about the safety of Jasper the parrot.

'The welfare of the bird is of immediate concern and we would urge anyone who knows where it is to contact police or arrange for it to be returned to the owner without delay,' Pc Dave Eldridge said.

'Anyone who has been offered a parrot for sale should call 101.'

Jasper was stolen between 9am and 3pm last Friday.

A force spokesman added: 'The bird is 20 years old and is described as 12' tall, grey body with a patchy white and grey head with a red tail.

'The bird is much loved and says phrases including the start of the Monty Python song, 'Always Look On The Bright Side of Life', which it then continues to whistle.'
