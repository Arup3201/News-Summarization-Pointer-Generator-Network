An African grey parrot that was reported stolen from a southern New Jersey zoo was found unharmed, walking along a local roadway.

Brutus disappeared Sunday from the Cape May County Zoo between his morning feeding and 2:15pm, when the staff returned to give him lunch.

The Press of Atlantic City reports Brutus was found unharmed Monday night when someone saw him walking along a road in Middle Township seven miles away from home.

But he did bite two police officers when they tried to pick him up.

Brutus was kept in a large cage in the zoo's aviary that was latched but not locked.

 Zookeeper Peter Cyr said locks seemed unnecessary because the parrots consistently try to bite or attack anyone who got too close.

Authorities say it's not clear who took the bird, who is valued at $800 to $1,000. 

The high-maintenance animal was donated to the Cape May County Zoo in 1997.
