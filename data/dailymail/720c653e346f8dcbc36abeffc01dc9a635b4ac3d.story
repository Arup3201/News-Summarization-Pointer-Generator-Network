Islamist militants fighting for ISIS appear to have released another propaganda video - this time showing a laughing jihadist mocking U.S. president Barack Obama.

The 15-minute long professionally edited video, filmed somewhere along the rebel-controlled border between Iraq and Syria, shows an unidentified fighter pulling up to the camera in a Ford 350 pick-up truck and asking: 'Obama, did you prepare enough diapers for your soldiers?'.

The slick video clip carries the logo of the AlHayat Media Center - the propaganda division of ISIS, which was also responsible for last month's slick recruitment video featuring three young British jihadists pleading with other Western Muslims to join them in the Middle East.

Joke: The professionally edited video shows an unidentified fighter pulling up to the camera in a Ford 350 pick-up truck and asking: 'Obama, did you prepare enough diapers for your soldiers?'

Jihadist: The bulk of the video features Abu Saffiya, an apparent ISIS militant who claims he comes from Chile and speaks in near-perfect English, albeit with an accent

Symbolism: Much of the video features a rant by Abu Saffiyah about the Sykes-Picot agreement. He then crosses the border and steps on an old signpost marking out the former crossing commander's office

The bulk of the video - which is titled 'The End of Sykes-Picot' - features Abu Saffiya, an apparent ISIS militant who claims he comes from Chile and speaks in perfect English, albeit with an accent.

Standing along the now effectively redundant border between Iraq and Syria, Saffiya begins a long rant about the 1916 Sykes-Picot agreement - the secret pact between Britain and France that resulted in the carving up of the Ottoman Empire after the First World War.

Saffiya breaks into a long tirade about how ISIS' lightning advance through eastern Syria and North East Iraq has effectively destroyed the borders quietly drawn up by the Allied forces, before issuing a warning that ISIS plans on extending the territory under its control.

The Sykes-Picot agreement features prominently in ISIS propaganda - most notably in last week's fourth edition of the militant group's slick English-language weekly magazine, which tells the story of the aftermath of the First World War through a distinctly Islamist perspective.

Boastful: Saffiyah shows flags and military badges that were left behind by government troops when they fled the border. He then mocks the mainly Shi'ite forces for displaying swords on their clothing

One of the major claims repeated in pro-ISIS propaganda is that the militants are 'correcting' wrongs established by the 1916 Sykes-Picot agreement.

The secret pact between Britain and France - which resulted in the carving up of the Ottoman Empire after the First World War - is mentioned in most material released by ISIS' Al Hayat Media Center.

Indeed this latest video is even titled 'The End of Sykes-Picot'.

The 1916 agreement effectively divided the Arab provinces of the Ottoman 
Empire outside the Arabian peninsula into areas of future British and 
French control.

The secret agreement is seen by many as a turning point in Western-Arab relations, as it broke a number of promises made to Muslim rulers about the founding of a caliphate in Greater Syria.

Now, almost 100 years on, ISIS uses these broken promises as a rallying cry - saying the borders drawn up by the pact represent ongoing non-Muslim influence in the Middle East.

Sykes-Picot also failed to take account of different ethnic groups in the region - creating new countries that were already steeped in sectarian divisions.

The caliphate ISIS said it had established on Sunday was partially declared to remove the internationally recognised borders established by Sykes-Picot.

This has the twin-effect of diminishing non-Muslim influence on Middle Eastern geography, and strengthening the authority of Sunni Muslims in North Iraq.

After symbolically crossing the border and stepping on an old signpost marking out the former crossing commander's office, Saffiya begins talking about the Iraqi government soldiers that deserted their posts in the face of the ISIS advance.

He shows military badges that were removed from discarded uniforms, and mocks the mainly Shi'ite forces for displaying swords on their clothing.

'As you can see there are weapons and swords and the Iraqi flag, but they are nothing but cowards they only run away,' he says.

'The soldiers, they took these [badges] 
off with their uniforms and they threw the uniforms in the streets and 
ran away like they were civilians. They are cowards,' he adds.

This video then cuts to a disturbing scene - which Saffiya jokes is 'exclusive footage' - appearing to show a room full of traumatised Shi'ite prisoners.

Standing over them in a cramped room with no windows, Saffiya verbally abuses the men for 'worshiping Lucifer', before locking the door.

The clip then shows Saffiya and a group of men destroying an abandoned police station with explosives.

Saffiya goes on to boast that ISIS now holds scores of U.S.-supplied vehicles that were stolen from government soldiers and border guards when the jihadists swept into Iraq's second city Mosul.

He jokes that the U.S. has spent billions in conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan and, rather than make the region safer, has only succeeded in indirectly providing militants with vehicles and weapons.

'Look at how much money America spends to fight Islam and it ends up being in our pockets,' Saffiyah says.

The clip 
then cuts to the scene on the ISIS fighter pulling up to the camera in 
the Ford pick-up truck and mocking U.S. president Barack Obama.

Daring
 the American military to take on ISIS, the militant says U.S. soldiers 
would be too terrified to take on the rebel forces, suggesting they 
would need to pack nappies if they intervene in Iraq.

Upon declaring a caliphate, the Sunni militants - whose brutality in attempting to establish control in Iraq and Syria has been branded too extreme even by Al Qaeda - demanded allegiance from Muslims around the world

Leader:Â  ISIS has declared its chief, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured left and right), the head of the new caliphate under the name Caliph Ibrahim and called on all Muslims around the world to swear loyalty to him

Caliphate: A map purportedly showing the areas ISIS plans to have under its control within five years has been widely shared online. As well as the Middle East, North Africa and large areas of Asia, it also reveals ISIS' ambition to extend into Europe. Spain, which was Muslim-ruled until the late 15th Century, would form part of the caliphate, as would the Balkan states and eastern Europe, up to and including Austria

The
 video emerged just two days after ISIS formally declared the territory 
it controls in the Middle East to be a caliphate, and announced its 
leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as the new leader of all the world's 
Muslims.

The chilling announcement was described as the 'most significant development in international jihadism since 9/11'.

Upon declaring a caliphate, the Sunni 
militants - whose brutality in attempting to establish control in Iraq 
and Syria has been branded too extreme even by Al Qaeda - demanded 
allegiance from Muslims around the world.

With brutal efficiency, ISIS has carved 
out a large chunk of territory that has effectively erased the border 
between Iraq and Syria and laid the foundations of its proto-state.

Now that it feels it has secure the 
territory under its control, the group announced it would be changing 
its name from the Islamic State of Iraq and Sham (also known as the 
Levant), to just the Islamic State, in order to appear less regional.

ISIS militants are in possession of a massive long-distance ballistic missile, supporters of the jihadist group have claimed.

Photographs
 show a large weapon being paraded on the back on a lorry surrounded by 
masked men in the Syrian city of Raqqa - the proclaimed capital of the 
new Sunni Muslim caliphate.

Supporters
 of the group - which changed its name to the Islamic State upon 
declaring the establishment of a caliphate on Sunday - said the missile 
was a Scud, although experts analysing the images believe the weapon is 
almost certainly inoperable and highly unlikely to pose a threat.

Missile: Photographs show a large weapon being paraded on the back on a lorry surrounded by masked men in the Syrian city of Raqqa - the proclaimed capital of the new Sunni Muslim caliphate

The weapon
 pictured being paraded by ISIS militants in Raqqa is believed to have 
been captured from another rebel group, the Free Syrian Army.

The
 FSA are understood to have acquired the Soviet-built missile when it 
captured a military base from government forces in the Deir ez-Zor 
region of Syria last September.

It is not 
known how the weapon ended up in the hands of ISIS, but social media 
accounts linked to militants fighting for the group in Iraq and Syria 
claimed they are now preparing it for use.

'Dawla
 Islamiyya (The Islamic State) has SCUD missile in #Raqqa. [God willing]
 its heading towards #Israel for a spectacular Eid ul fitr,' an ISIS 
suspporter calling himself Ansar Udeen said on Twitter.

A number of experts have poured cold water on the idea that the missile could be a threat, however.

Mystery: It is not known how the weapon ended up in the hands of ISIS, but social media accounts linked to militants fighting for the group in Iraq and Syria claimed they are now preparing it for use

Elliot
 Nelson, a blogger who tracks munitions used in Syria, tweeted: 'The 
only danger that Islamic State scud is to anyone at the moment is if 
they accidentally run over a pedestrian showing it off.'

Meanwhile
 Charles Lister - an expert on the Syrian conflict who works at the at 
the Brookings Doha Center research organisation - called the missile 99 
per cent useless, according to the Telegraph.

This morning, Iraq's newly elected members of parliament attended their first government 
session in Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone.

The new parliament ended its inaugural session by failing to make any 
progress in choosing a new prime minister - even as the country faces a 
militant blitz that threatens to rip it apart.

World leaders and senior clerics have urged Iraq's fractious politicians
 to unite in the face of the militant onslaught, which has killed more 
than 2,000 people, displaced hundreds of thousands and polarised the 
country's Shiite, Sunni and Kurdish populations.
