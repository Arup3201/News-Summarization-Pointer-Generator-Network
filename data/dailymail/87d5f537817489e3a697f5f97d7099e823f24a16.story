Two children tested for Ebola after arriving in the UK from Africa are clear of the deadly virus, Public Health England has said. 

It's understood the children, whose ages have not been released, underwent precautionary tests in Newcastle for Ebola and malaria.

Public Health England said that the two children had tested negative for Ebola

The children were taken to the Infectious Disease Isolation Unit at the Royal Victoria Infirmary,one of three units outside of London that can care for patients with infectious diseases such as Ebola.

They were tested for the deadly virus on Thursday after showing viral symptoms. At the time medics said they thought it was 'unlikely' the pair had the disease.

PHE said in a statement today: 'We can confirm that the precautionary tests carried out on two children in Newcastle for Ebola are negative.

'The overall risk to the general UK population of imported Ebola continues to be very low.'

A spokesman for Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust refused to comment. 

The Ebola epidemic has killed more than 5,000 people in West Africa. Around 100 people in the UK have been tested for the virus, with all receiving the all clear.
