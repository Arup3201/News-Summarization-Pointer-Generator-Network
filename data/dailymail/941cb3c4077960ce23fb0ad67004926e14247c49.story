A cruise ship with 1,000 people on board that was disabled by a fire and was drifting in southern Philippine waters has been repaired and is headed toward Malaysia, the Philippine coast guard said Saturday.

The Azamara Quest informed the coast guard late Saturday that its power and propulsion had been restored and it was moving slowly toward Sandakan, its next destination after it left Manila Thursday, spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Algier Ricafrente said.

A coast guard vessel sent to assist the cruise liner reported that it had sighted the ship from about 9 kilometers (5 nautical miles) away and was approaching it.

A spokeswoman for Azamara Club Cruises said later there are 97 UK passengers onboard the ship.

The ship's captain earlier said by email 
to the coast guard that it needed no assistance and that everything was 'under control.'

Ricafrente said that the coast guard will provide assistance to the vessel 'while it is inside our area of responsibility.'

A fire broke out in the ship 8.19pm on Friday night. The flames engulfed one of 
the ship's engine rooms but were quickly extinguished, Azamara Club 
Cruises said in a statement.

Five crew suffered smoke inhalation, 
including one who was seriously injured and needed hospital care.

The stricken ship was drifting Saturday in the Sulu Sea about 130 
kilometers (70 nautical miles) south of the Philippines' Tubbataha Reef,
Ricafrente said. The area lies between the Philippines and the island 
of Borneo, which is divided between Malaysia and Indonesia.

'As a gesture of goodwill and to 
thank our guests for their understanding, we will be providing all 
guests with a full refund for their cruise,' the company said in its 
statement.

'Azamara Club Cruises will also be 
providing each guest with a future cruise certificate for 100% of the 
cruise fare paid for their March 26, 2012, Azamara Quest sailing.'

An earlier statement from the Foreign Office said a consular team from the region would be sent to meet the ship when it docks.

Contact from some of the passengers has been made onshore, Mr Scott, 45, said he had received an email from his parents to say they are now sailing towards Malaysia.

'I have just received an email - 
saying that they hope to get there by Monday morning and will probably 
disembark then,' he said. They have said the staff and the captain have 
been fantastic.'

Azamara Club Cruises is part of Royal
Caribbean Cruises, which along with competitor Carnival Corp. has seen 
bookings drop after high-profile cruise accidents this year. In January,
Carnival's Costa Concordia capsized off the coast of Italy, killing 32 
people.

It was the latest accident in the cruise industry since 32 people died 
when the Costa Concordia ran aground and capsized off the western coast 
of Italy in January.

A month later, a fire on the Costra Allegra left that ship without power
and adrift in waters known to be prowled by pirates in the Indian Ocean
for three days. Both Costa ships are part of Costa Crociere, a 
subsidiary of Carnival Corp., the world's largest cruise operator.
