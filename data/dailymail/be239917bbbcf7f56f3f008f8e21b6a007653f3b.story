One in five people in the UK say they are too embarrassed to play sport or exercise with other people because they are too unfit.

In addition, more than a quarter admit they find it hard to motivate themselves to play sport or get more exercise, according to a new survey.

Despite this, more than a third of people polled said they would like to be more active to improve their health.

The survey, carried out by consumer analysts Mintel, found that more than a third (36 per cent) of people have not played or participated in sport in the past 12 months.

This rose to more than half of people aged 55-64 and to three out of five of those over 65.

Women found it especially difficult to get up off the sofa.

The survey found 41 per cent of women have not played sport in the past year, with a third agreeing that they find it hard to motivate themselves.

Despite this, 44 per cent of women say they would like to be more active to improve their health.

When it comes to locating the sportiest areas, those living in the South East and East Anglia are the most reluctant to feel the burn, with 40 per cent of people in these areas admitting they had not taken part in any sport in the past year.

London boasts the sportiest residents, with only a third of people not having exercised in the past 12 months.

The survey also questioned British people on their favourite sports.

Swimming is the nation's favourite form of exercise, with almost a third (29 per cent) of people reporting that they had swum in the past year.

Cycling came second, with 19 per cent of British people reporting getting their bike out in the last 12 months, and jogging came in third, with 17 per cent of people reporting they'd been for a run.

When it comes to trying new sports, 44 per cent of Britons are interested in trying individual sports, 25 per cent outdoor or alternative sports and 22 per cent racquet sports.

Although swimming comes top again, with 17 per cent interested in trying this in the future, it's yoga and Pilates that appears second on the list with 12 per cent of Britons interested in participating in this in the future, rising to 19 per cent of women.

However, despite recent successes of UK female sport teams, women seem to be more reluctant to take up stereotypical male sports in the future, with just four per cent of women who haven't played sport in the past year interested in trying golf in the future.

They showed even less interest in playing football (two per cent) and cricket (one per cent).

In comparison, 10 per cent of men who haven't played sport in the last year said they would be interested in playing golf, 8 per cent interested in playing football and 7 per cent keen for a game of cricket.

David Walmsley, senior leisure analyst at Mintel, said: 'Not feeling fit enough to play with others could be one expression of a more general lack of physical confidence that stems from unfamiliarity with sport more widely.'

He added it was significant this attitude was most common among older people, who are least likely to take part in sport either individually or with others.

'However, the fact that it is also more common among people who play sport with other family members suggests promoting this type of play could be a useful means of breaking down these wider barriers.

'Playing with family offers a supportive setting in which people who have not played in many years can regain their confidence and enthusiasm for sport.'

Indeed, 21 per cent of Brits who have played sport with their family in the past year say they don’t feel fit enough to play sport or exercise with other people.

However, Mintel's research shows that parents are the strongest cheerleaders for the importance of exercise.

More than a third (38 per cent) of parents said they try to encourage their children to play sport to help them develop a healthy lifestyle.

However, 55 per cent of this group agreed that playing sport or exercising regularly means you don't have to worry too much about what you eat.

This was a lot higher than the national average for agreeing with this statement, which was 10 per cent.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, British parents who encourage their children to play sport are the most likely to believe in the importance of group exercise.

As many as 62 per cent agree that playing organised sport makes it easier to stick to a fitness or weight-loss programme than going to the gym or exercising alone, while an average of just 15 per cent of Britons agree this is true.

Mr Walmsley added that parents advocating sport could help children stay healthy – and might even help them to be more active too.

He said: 'High levels of recognition from parents of the health value of sport is positive for children's participation and could be a way of keeping children's weight in check without having to constantly police their diets.'
