David Cameron was under mounting pressure last night to recall Parliament to debate Britain’s response to the terrifying advance of Islamist fanatics in Iraq.

As the Prime Minister began his third holiday of the year, the former head of the Army, Lord Dannatt, said ‘the nation would expect’ Parliament to be recalled.

Lord Dannatt, a former defence adviser to Mr Cameron, said the potential implications of the conflict – which Mr Cameron warned this week could bring ‘mayhem to our streets’ – meant that Britain’s response should be fully debated.

He added: ‘I think MPs and members of the House of Lords will get very frustrated if they stay in recess.

‘People need to have a full debate about it and express their point of view. I think the nation would expect that.’ Mr Cameron has already approved the use of special forces troops in northern Iraq, and British warplanes are conducting reconnaissance missions over large swathes of Iraq as part of an intervention that is expected to last for months.

The Prime Minister has ruled out a large-scale deployment of British ‘boots on the ground’. But he is considering arming the Kurdish fighters who are trying to push back the Islamic State terrorists in Iraq.

Tory MP Conor Burns said this move alone required parliamentary approval.

He said: ‘We are tiptoeing towards having a policy.

‘We are seeing people be-headed, some people buried alive and even, extraordinarily, crucifixions carried out in Iraq, by ISIS, a group that want to wage a holocaust on those who don’t share their evil and craven outlook on the world.

‘I want Parliament to come back and I want us to hold the Government to account. Why are we not arming the Kurds? Why are we only providing humanitarian aid?’

Mr Cameron faced criticism yesterday as he and his wife Samantha began a week-long break in Cornwall, less than a week after returning from a vacation in Portugal. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon has also departed on holiday, leaving new Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond to handle the crisis.

Mr Cameron has defended his break, saying he will return to London immediately if the crisis in Iraq worsens.

The United Nations agency for refugees yesterday launched a major aid operation to reach half a million people displaced in northern Iraq.

In the town of Dohuk, survivors told horrific stories of IS brutality and executions. Khalof Khodede, a father of three, told how 80 men in the Yazidi village of Kocho were killed and all the women and girls were kidnapped.

He said he had only survived by hiding under the bodies of those executed, He said that IS fighters took the men to the first floor of a building and the women to the second after the villagers’ money and gold jewellery were seized.

The Yazidis were then loaded onto minibuses in groups of 10 to 20 and transported outside the village after being told they would be taken to Sinjar, the ancient homeland of the sect.

The vehicles stopped abruptly and the militants opened fire without warning.

Yesterday Iraqi forces halted an offensive they had launched to recapture the city of Tikrit, 80 miles north of Baghdad, due to fierce resistance from Islamic State fighters.
