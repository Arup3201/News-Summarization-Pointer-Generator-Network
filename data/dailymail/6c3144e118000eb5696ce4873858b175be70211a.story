Disgusted passengers donned masks and complained of an ‘unbearable’ stench after liquid from bathrooms ran down the aisles of a Virgin Australia flight to Sydney on Monday.

The situation was so excruciating for passengers and crew that the plane was forced to turn back and land in Los Angeles just three hours into its 14-hour transpacific journey.

Virgin Australia described it as a ‘fresh water overflow’ from lavatory sinks and denied passengers’ stomach-churning claims that human waste had seeped into the cabin.

But passenger Julia Malley, from Christchurch, New Zealand, told the New Zealand Herald that she could see human waste running down one of the aisles of the Boeing 777, which became known as the ‘poo plane’ on social media.

She said: ‘We could see it go through the aisles, like it was very obvious. They said over the loudspeaker that they were going to clean it up and then three hours into the flight they were like, “I'm sorry we're going to have to turn around, it's unsafe”.’

‘They cleaned it up but the smell couldn't really be hidden.’

She told the newspaper that one crew member even joked it was a ‘sh***y situation’.

The airline insisted it was not human waste as the toilets operate on a separate drainage system.

Passengers were delayed for nearly 15 hours before they were put on another flight to Sydney

But Ms Malley rejected the airline’s claims and was adamant she saw human waste in the aisles.

She said: ‘If it was water, why would they turn the plane around? We saw bits of toilet paper and cr**.’

One of the 350 passengers, Melbourne musician John Collins, tweeted that the liquid smelled like vomit and it was believed a toilet had exploded.

A Virgin Australia spokeswoman told News.com.au that two of the sinks suffered leaks, but there was no hygiene issue aboard flight VA2 and the safety of the aircraft was never in question.

She said the aircraft was inspected by engineers after it landed at LAX and cleared to return to service.

Sorry: Virgin Australia apologised to passengers and offered a travel credit for the disruption

The sinks may have overflowed due to a blockage caused by a toothpaste cap, according to reports.

In a letter to passengers, who were delayed for nearly 15 hours before boarding another flight, Virgin Australia apologised and offered a travel credit or bonus rewards points.

Roger Lindeman, the airline’s general manager of ground operations, wrote: ‘Unfortunately the aircraft did need to return to Los Angeles due to an issue with plumbing in the fresh water overflow system on board and could not continue with the journey.

‘At no time was health or safety at risk to any persons on board the aircraft.’
