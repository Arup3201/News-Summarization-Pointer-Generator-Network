Fresh from his round of golf with President Obama on Sunday, Tiger Woods chose to be complimentary yesterday when asked about the course skills of the most powerful man in the world.

The notorious philanderer and Mr. Obama played out a 'boy's weekend' over the President's Day weekend at the Floridian Yacht and Golf Club and Woods was quizzed at a press conference after a practice round at the WGC-Accenture Matchplay Championship in Arizona.

'He’s got amazing touch,' said Woods. 'He can certainly chip and putt. If he ever spent — after these four years — spent more time playing the game of golf, I’m sure he could get to where he’s a pretty good stick.,' said the world's number two golfer somewhat diplomatically.

Asked if the president and Woods had squared up against each other over 18-holes, the 14-time major winner revealed that Mr. Obama had been his partner in a foursome against U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk and Houston Astros owner Jim Crane.

'He was my partner, and as I said, we won,' said a smiling Woods.

'Playing with Mr. President was pretty cool,' Woods said. 'He’s just a wonderful person to be around. We won.'

Quizzed further on the leader of the free world's golfing abilities, Woods praised the president's fitness.

'He’s a pretty good athlete, and we all know he played a lot of hoops,' said Woods.

He sounded surprised to learn that Obama played left-handed, and when asked to describe the president's best shot, Woods said that ';he hit a few.''

'He’s a lefty, but to see him out hitting shots — he hit it well, and we didn’t play under the easiest conditions.'

Pushed on how he got the invitation, Woods said: 'He calls up and says, 'Hey Tiger you wanna play?'

'Obviously there is a process that's involved, and I was invited to play, and it was an invitation that certainly you don't turn down, especially [since] he's an avid golfer, and so am I.

'So we went out there and we had just a great round of golf with Ron and Jim, and it was a good day.'

The traveling pool of journalists who follow the President's every move were reportedly furious after being shut out of his round of golf and not being allowed on to the club grounds on Sunday.

It has long been a White House tradition that pool reporters cover the President's rounds of golf and even have the opportunity for a few questions on the course.

When he landed back in Washington and walked across the White House lawn, several frustrated reporters collectively shouted to the President to ask if he had beaten Tiger Woods.

He did not respond.

The outrage over the lack of transparency comes as much of the bill for the pricey trip will be paid for by tax payers, yet President Obama did not feel it appropriate to even release one photo of his time out on the course.

The President played with the notorious philanderer on Sunday after getting a private lesson from Woods' former coach the day before.

However the only inside reports about the rounds came from a golf journalist who happened to be in the clubhouse at the time.

'Speaking on behalf of the White House Correspondents Association, I can say a broad cross section of our members from print, radio, online and TV have today expressed extreme frustration to me about having absolutely no access to the President of the United States this entire weekend,' Fox News reporter Ed Henry said.

$943,687.50: estimated cost of a trip for Air Force One from Chicago to West Palm Beach and then back to Washington, D.C.$13,500: Cost to rent out three four-bedroom guest cottages at The Floridian for three nights$24,000: Cost of an eight-hour private golf lesson with famed instructor Butch Harmon$1,800: Greens fees for three guests for two rounds of golf$1,600: Cost of four caddies for two rounds of golf$4,620: Cost of 20 rooms at the Port St. Lucie Holiday Inn for traveling press and security detail based on the government day rate

TOTAL: $989,207

The President's deputy press secretary Josh Earnest responded to the pool's concerns by simply saying that they were previously told about the level of access- or lack thereof- that they should expect from the weekend.

ABC News reported that in 2012, it cost $179,750 per flight hour to run Air Force One.

Using that rate- even though it is likely higher now since gas prices have risen- the cost of the flights to Florida and back to Washington on Monday totaled $943,687.50.

He rented out all three of the four-bedroom guest cottages on the grounds of The Floridian for the whole of the long weekend, as well about 20 hotel rooms from the nearby Holiday Inn- which is about 20 minutes drive from the course- for his traveling entourage of press and security.

Expectantly, their price differentials are significant, as one night in a guest cottage costs $1,500 while the Holiday Inn told MailOnline that they charged the government a day rate of $77 per room.

On top of the logistical expenses, 
the whole point of the trip was to relax on the golf course, which 
involves a whole host of expenses in itself.

Guest greens fees at The Floridian are $300 per person, and each player hires a caddy who costs $200 per round.

For three guests to play two rounds of golf over the weekend, greens fees come to $1,800 and the caddies fees for the foursome total $1,600.

Another personal expense that Mr Obama racked up came from the eight hour one-on-one lesson with golf pro Mr Harmon. Since those lessons typically cost $3,000, that means that Mr Obama's bill came to a tidy $24,000 after his intensive session on Saturday.

During his stay, the President never left the grounds of the golf club, meaning that his transportation and security costs were kept to a minimum. A spokesman for the nearby police department said that they had not been asked by the Secret Service to provide any additional security.

While this is the first time that the President has played golf with Woods- who has won the most titles in the storied sport- it is not the first time that they have met.

The disgraced golfer did a reading at one of President Obama's inaugural festivities in 2009 and followed that up with a visit to the White House.

In David Maraniss's 2012 biography of President Obama he especially looked at his enduring love affair with basketball.

Traveling to Punahou, an elite prep school in Hawaii to discover what his classmates made of his skills, Maraniss discovered that he wasn't that good:

'If Obama was 
unhappy about his playing time, the truth is he had to work exceedingly 
hard just to make the team. He made it more because of his intense 
passion for the game -- his will -- than anything else. …The reality was
 that Barry, as skilled and intelligent a player as he was, could not 
stand out in this group. He had good court sense and an ability to slash
 to the basket, but was an unreliable outside shooter and not much of a 
jumper...'Decades
 later, a story emerged that his nickname was Barry O’Bomber, playing 
off his last name and a propensity to fire away from long range, but few
 team members recalled that nickname… and said the real gunner was Darin
 Maurer, who was better than Obama but barely got more playing time…'He
 loved basketball so much, I think a lot of things have been blown out 
of proportion,” said [former teammate Alan] Lum. … [W]hen it came down 
to playing time, he [Barry] wasn’t one of the five best.” In fact, Lum 
and other teammates pointed out, Barry was only occasionally considered 
one of the top eight…'Obama…was
 also among the most earthbound – he could not jump high enough to dunk 
the ball. “Barry’s lack of ups was obvious,” recalled [former player 
Tom] Topolinski. In fact, [coach Chris] McLachlin coined a phrase for the phenomenon: Barry Obama, famous for his no-jump jump shot!
