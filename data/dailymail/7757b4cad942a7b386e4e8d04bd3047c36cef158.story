The president of the Oxford Union who is accused of raping a fellow student will not be continuing with his duties, students were told last night.

Ben Sullivan, 21, who was arrested and questioned by police over two alleged offences before being released on bail, has not formally resigned his position.

But at last night's Oxford Union debate, undergraduate Mayank Banerjee, 21, told students that he would take on the day-to-day running of the union.

Students who attended the debate on Scottish independence said Mr Banerjee told the 80-strong audience he was now Acting President, and added: 'Obviously he [Sullivan] is innocent until proven guilty.'

There was no sign of Sullivan, a third year History and Politics student whose finals exams start next month, at the Union debate, but friends said he was in his room at Christ Church College.

The privately-educated undergraduate, from Kensington, west London, was arrested by Thames Valley Police shortly after 7am on Wednesday.

He was questioned for several hours on suspicion of rape and an attempted rape, both of which are alleged to have taken place in January and April last year. 

Both alleged victims are said to be female students at the university.  Sullivan was later bailed without charge until 18 June.

Mr Banerjee, a second-year undergraduate studying politics, philosophy and economics (PPE) at St John’s College, was due to take over as president next term, but has stepped up early.

Sullivan, a former pupil at £22,000-a-year St Paul's School in west London, was elected unopposed to the illustrious post of president of the Oxford Union last year.

The debating society has been a breeding ground for future prime ministers and politicians since it was founded in 1823, with William Gladstone, Herbert Asquith and Edward Heath among its alumni.

More recently, it has been a stepping stone to success for Foreign Secretary, William Hague, Education Secretary, Michael Gove and Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London.

No-one from the Oxford Union was available for comment this morning.
