Roma manager Rudi Garcia has won his appeal against a two-match ban imposed for allegedly clashing with a steward after his side’s Serie A win at Genoa.

The Frenchman will be back on the bench for second-placed Roma’s clash with AC Milan at the Stadio Olimpico on Saturday.

The former Lille manager's ban was lifted after the steward retracted his claims.

Roma's Greek left-back Jose Holebas also won his appeal. The former Olympiacos had been given a one-match suspension for his alleged 'provocative and insulting' hand gesture toward the Genoa fans.

Roma were themselves fined 30,000 euros for failing to cooperate with the Italian FA's investigation into the incident while Genoa were also fined for the behaviour of their fans during the match.

The home supporters voiced their displeasure by hurling objects on to the pitch at the final whistle.
