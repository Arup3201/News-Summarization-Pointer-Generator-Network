A 22-year-old Washington State man faces nearly six years in jail for allegedly kidnapping his girlfriend at knifepoint and forcing her to drive the nearly 1,000-mile trip to Las Vegas with him so they could get married.

Thomas Martin Pfeiffer was arrested about 6:30 a.m. Friday in the parking lot of a gas station in Baker City, Oregon, and charged with kidnapping, menacing, coercion, fourth-degree assault, harassment and unlawful use of a weapon.

The incident started on Thursday night when Pfeiffer and his and his girlfriend, Virginia Valdez, 23, left Moses Lake, Wash, according to the Baker City Herald.

Valdez told police Pfeiffer said they were going to Nevada to get married.

Valdez didnâ€™t want to make the trip, but
 she told police that Pfeiffer refused to let her leave the car and 
threatened her with a knife.

The couple were also traveling with their 22-month-old daughter, Ava.

They stopped once during the night between Moses Lake and Baker City, but as there were few people around Valdez didnâ€™t feel safe trying to get away.

The incident started in Moses Lake, Washington State, on Thursday night, headed for Las Vegas. Thomas Pfeiffer stopped once during the night before taking a second break in Baker City, Oregon, where he was arrested after his girlfriend, Virginia Valdez, made a scene showing she was in distress

However, a few hours later, as they pulled into the Baker Truck Corrall in Baker City, about half way through the estimated 15 hour trip, Valdez saw her opportunity to escape.

According to police, she got out of the car near the gas pumps, got down on the ground and started to yell for help.

Her screams attracted attention and someone called police.

Because Pfeiffer was arrested in Oregon, he is facing at least five years and 10 months in prison, because second-degree kidnapping is a Measure 11 crime in the state.

Bail was set at $155,500.
