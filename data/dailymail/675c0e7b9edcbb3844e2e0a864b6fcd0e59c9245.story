A new drug-free gel, called Flexiseq, is set to bring relief to Britain's nine million arthritis sufferers

A new drug-free gel may bring relief to Britain’s nine million osteoarthritis sufferers.

It can be rubbed into painful joints twice a day and, because it is drug-free, it is not thought to cause any dangerous side effects

Researchers carried out six clinical studies involving 4,000 patients and found Flexiseq can reduce pain and improve the mobility of osteoarthritis sufferers.

One study of 1,300 patients found it creates a natural lubricant for the joints and is as good for pain relief as commonly prescribed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

It was published in Rheumatology - the British Society of Rheumatology’s official journal.

Dr John Dickson, a co-founder of the Primary Care Rheumatology Society, worked on the study.

He said: ‘It is well recognised that effectively managing chronic pain, particularly in patients with other conditions and risk factors, is a massive challenge that GPs and patients face on a daily basis.

‘This topical treatment is drug-free and seems to have an excellent safety profile.’

The water-based gel is made up of millions of droplets of fat, called phospholipids, which travel through the skin and tissue, penetrating the joint.

They then coat the cartilage with a layer of protective lubricant, replacing naturally occurring phospholipids which have been ruined by arthritis.

This reduces friction between adjoining bones, resulting in less pain and better mobility.

Professor Philip Conaghan, from the University of Leeds, who led the research, said: ‘The need for new treatment options is well recognised as existing treatments don’t always work and many can cause serious side effects.

‘Many [osteoarthritis] patients are elderly and have additional health conditions that mean they are especially at risk of these side effects.

The water-based gel contains millions of fat particles which penetrate the joint and act as a lubricant between the bones. This increases mobility and reduces pain

‘Safety is therefore a key concern for new therapies and patients and healthcare professionals would welcome new treatment options which are effective and without such safety concerns.’

The gel, produced by company Pro Bono Bio, was developed in Germany and is already available in Germany and Ireland.

It was awarded Innovation of 2013 by the Federal Association of German Pharmacists.

Michael Earl, chief operating officer of Pro Bono Bio, said: ‘The proven physical mode of action and the lack of an active pharmaceutical ingredient give Flexiseq the best of both worlds – it works, and it’s safe.’

Until January the gel is only available from Arthritis Research UK and LloydsPharmacy. After that it will be available in all pharmacies at £16.80 per tube.
