A racquet smashed by tennis star John McEnroe at Wimbledon, in one of his famous anger outbursts, could be worth up to £15,000 for its schoolboy owner.

Sam Matthews’ mother Linda was given the broken racquet by McEnroe more than 30 years ago when he rented a flat from her.

In 2005, Sam, then aged 10, took it to a children’s version of the BBC’s Antiques Roadshow.

At the time there was no proof the racquet had been owned by McEnroe, who became as famous for his temper as he was for his tennis.

When the show returned to film at Wimbledon for an episode shown last night, presenter Fiona Bruce tracked down Sam and showed his racquet to the American player turned pundit.

Viewers will see Miss Bruce tell McEnroe: 'I think it has the ring of authenticity, smashed in a moment of anger.'

Antiques Roadshow expert Jon Baddeley said: 'If it was used in the amazing 1980 final against Bjorn Borg then it's of extreme ­value.' Above, McEnroe breaks his racquet during a Wimbledon match with Bjorn Borg in 1981

McEnroe, 51, agreed and signed the item for Sam. 'That was ­definitely a racquet I played with,' he added. 'I know this is hard to believe but there were times when I got a little upset out there!'

Sam, now 17, was delighted to learn the racquet is an antique worth a five-figure sum.

'My mum ran a block of flats where McEnroe used to stay,' he said. 'She got to know him well and even helped sew the sponsorship badges on his shirts.

McEnroe was famous for taking his frustrations out on the court on his tennis racquets - and the umpire

'When he left, McEnroe handed this broken racquet to her along with an unbroken one and some other memorabilia as a sort of thank-you.'

Antiques Roadshow expert Jon Baddeley said: 'If it was used in the amazing 1980 final against Bjorn Borg – one of the all-time great matches – then it’s of extreme ­value. Borg’s racquet from that game recently sold for $25,000.'

Sam believes McEnroe used the racquet in his 1980 semi-final against Jimmy Connors, the year before his first Wimbledon win.

Sam, from Taunton, Somerset, said: 'I’ve been told the racquet may be worth £15,000 if it was used in the 1980 ­final.

'It’s still worth £10,000 if used in the semi-final.'
