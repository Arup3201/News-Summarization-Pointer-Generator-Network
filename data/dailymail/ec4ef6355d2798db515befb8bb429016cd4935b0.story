A driver got wedged into the back of a lorry and dragged for more than six miles as the truck driver thought honking motorists were telling him to speed up.

The run-in between an articulated truck and the car - thought to be a £100,000 Porsche Cayenne - was caught on film on a busy highway in China's Jiangxi Province.

Car driver Zhen Yin, 32, was reportedly a drug user who had fallen unconscious - and when police investigated they were said to have found his boot 'full of cocaine'.

Hitching a ride: This run-in between a car and an articulated truck went on for six miles on a busy Chinese road

Oblivious: The truck driver said he thought fellow motorists were telling him to speed up, so he did

Oblivious to what was happening, lorry driver Xiong Feng, 45, carried on for six and a half miles before being flagged down by another trucker.

'The first I became aware of anything was when I heard some loud honking beside me,' he said. 'He had his window down and was shouting something but I couldn't hear him, and then he started pointing at the back of my truck.

'But I thought he was telling me to speed up, so I did.'

He added: 'Eventually I pulled over and it was only then that I saw the car stuck on the back.'

Witness Jian Yeh, 45, said: 'We were coming up behind the Porsche and I remember thinking that it was very close to the back of the lorry.

'To my astonishment I realised it was actually stuck to the back of it.

One witness said: 'The driver was clearly unconscious and I didn't know if he was dead or just asleep'

Police are said to have arrested the car driver, an alleged drug dealer, after finding his boot was 'full of cocaine'

Costly: Porsche Cayennes cost around £50,000 in Britain but fetch double that price at Chinese dealerships

'The driver was clearly unconscious and I didn't know if he was dead or just asleep, so I started beeping my horn to try and either wake him up and alert the lorry driver.'

German-made Porsche Cayennes cost around £50,000 in Britain but fetch around double that price at Chinese dealerships, partly due to the lure of Western technology.

According to the Central European news agency, police said the car driver was a known cocaine dealer with a boot stuffed with drugs.

'When officers arrived they not only found a drug dealer we've been hunting a long time, but his boot was full of cocaine too,' a police spokesman said.

They are holding him in a prison hospital because they found 'several hundred red pills' and bags of a crystal-like substance, reported as methamphetamine, as well as cocaine. 

If he is convicted of serious drug offences Zhen could face the death penalty.
