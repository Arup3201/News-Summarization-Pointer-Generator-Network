BBC radio DJ Liz Kershaw has been named as the woman alleged to have made threatening phone calls to a male colleague who committed suicide last month.

Detectives last week launched an inquiry to help the coroner discover why Russell Joslin, 50, suffocated himself.

His family claim he was driven to his death after BBC bosses failed to take seriously allegations that he had been offended by a female colleague five years ago.

Claims: Russel Joslin's father Peter alleges that BBC DJ Liz Kershaw made threatening calls to his son

However The Mail on Sunday has been unable to substantiate these allegations. The identity of the woman has so far remained a secret and Ms Kershaw has not responded to repeated requests from The Mail on Sunday to talk about the matter.

But both sources at the BBC and Mr Joslin’s father, a former chief constable, have identified Ms Kershaw as the woman linked to the Warwickshire police investigation.

The news adds to the pressure on the BBC. Ms Kershaw, now a DJ on BBC digital station 6 Music, recently claimed she was routinely groped by male colleagues when she worked at Radio 1 in the Eighties. She spoke out in the wake of revelations about Jimmy Savile.

Mr Joslin, who as a reporter at BBC 
Coventry and Warwickshire, is believed to have received a series of 
phone messages from Ms Kershaw after they argued during a meal out 
together in 2007 and he apparently walked out on her in a restaurant, 
leaving her to find her own way back to Coventry. The phone messages 
branded him a ‘flake’ and ‘a loser’.

Ms Kershaw, now 54, worked at BBC Coventry and Warwickshire between 2005 and 2011.

While there is no evidence that the 
messages contributed to the death of Mr Joslin, who was being treated in
 a psychiatric hospital when he died, his family claim that he was left 
‘a shadow of his former self’ because he felt bosses failed to act on 
his complaints.

The BBC has launched an investigation, but the family are demanding a fully independent inquiry.

Mr Joslin’s father Peter, 77, the 
retired chief constable of Warwickshire, said last night: ‘When Liz 
Kershaw joined BBC Coventry and Warwickshire she did not know the area 
and for some reason Russell was chosen to show her around.

‘He quite enjoyed it, I think, until this particular incident but after that life became very tough for him.

‘We have the recordings of what she 
said to him. Russell, being a good reporter, actually recorded the 
messages as they were being left.

‘They were very unpleasant and she 
made it clear that she felt she was on a different level to him.  A lot 
of things happened because he had to carry on working with her. He did 
not tell us everything but it badly affected him.

‘He was contracted to read the news 
on her show and told some of his friends about how she had cut him off 
and that sort of thing. It changed the way he felt about the BBC.’

Peter Joslin, who led the 
Warwickshire force for 15 years, added: ‘He had a bad episode earlier in
 the year. We thought he had recovered, but after a discussion with 
senior people at the BBC he thought there was no hope of obtaining 
justice. A few days later he killed himself.

‘The discussion between Russell and 
the BBC happened a week before he died. I don’t know what part the Jimmy
 Savile business played in Russell’s mind but he followed the news.

‘Russell was a character, the last 
person many of his friends would have thought this would happen to.  But
 he was a reporter to the end and this is the last story for him. His 
last act was to make sure people knew the reason. He did not leave a 
letter but there are so many ways of getting your message out these 
days.

‘Until now, I have felt sick in the stomach because nobody was allowed to say who it was that Russell had been talking about.’

When asked if he had given Liz 
Kershaw’s name to police, Mr Joslin  replied: ‘We did speak to the 
police about this in the early stages. I know they have all the facts 
and the names of those involved. ’

Russell is though to have spoken to 
the BBC occupational health department about the case this spring, when 
he was off work with stress.

According to reports, one of the 
phone messages sent to Mr Joslin said: ‘Thanks for abandoning me. Don’t 
ever ever think of me as your mate again. Do what you have to at the BBC
 cause you are a loser on 27 grand a year. But don’t ever encroach on me
 or my talent.’

Another message said: ‘You are flaky,
 you are poor, you are weak. I don’t want anything to do with you except
 on the radio. Goodbye.’

A third said: ‘Don’t ever, ever presume friendship with me again, all right? Goodbye.’

The allegation that Ms Kershaw,  made
 the calls to Mr Joslin came after she claimed last month there was a 
culture of sexual harassment of women at Radio 1 and that she was groped
 while broadcasting live.

Ms Kershaw, who worked for Radio 1 in
 the Eighties, met BBC director-general George Entwistle after she 
claimed on Radio 4’s Today programme that an unidentified male colleague
 had repeatedly stroked her breasts while she was on air.

She said: ‘There was a reporter who 
routinely groped me. I would be sitting in the studio with my headphones
 on and my back to the studio door. I couldn’t say anything, I couldn’t 
even explain because I was broadcasting to the nation.’

A BBC spokesman refused to be drawn on Ms Kershaw’s involvement in the matter.

He said: ‘It would be inappropriate 
to comment on names or specific details until all the facts are known 
but the BBC is committed to working constructively with the family to 
ensure that their concerns are vigorously addressed.

‘What we can say is that we are 
undertaking an investigation overseen by an external professional to 
establish the facts about how any complaints made by Russell were 
reported and how the BBC acted on them. We will also co-operate fully 
with the coroner’s inquest which is charged with determining the cause 
of Russell’s death and will consider its findings carefully’.

When approached by The Mail on Sunday yesterday Ms Kershaw declined to comment.
