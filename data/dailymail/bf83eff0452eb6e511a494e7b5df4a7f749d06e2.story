Gross misconduct: Det Supt Steve Fulcher faces a hearing into his failure to read a murderer his rights

More than 1,300 suspected criminals including alleged rapists, child molesters, violent offenders and at least one murderer have escaped justice in the past five years because of police blunders over arrests.

Figures show that errors in paperwork, failure to read suspects their rights or mistakes in the way officers conducted interviews have meant at least 200 suspects a year walked free without charge.

Since 2008, these have included 262 suspected violent criminals and 21 sex offenders, three of whom were suspected rapists and one of who was accused of sexually abusing a young boy.

Only last month, a convicted killer 
escaped prosecution for a second murder because an officer failed to 
follow procedures. The official statistics, derived from Freedom of 
Information requests, provoked fury.

Conservative
 MP Nick de Bois, a member of the Commons Justice Committee, said: 
‘These figures are quite shocking and I hope an investigation into the 
cases in question takes place to see if lessons can be learned so we can
 stop this happening in future.’

Javed
 Khan, chief executive of charity Victim Support, added: ‘It is a 
worrying state of affairs if the people who are there to uphold the law 
are putting criminals in a position where they may be able to evade 
justice.’

Last month a 
detective who failed to read a killer his rights when persuading him to 
reveal where a woman’s body had been dumped was told he could be sacked.

Wiltshire
 Detective Superintendent Steve Fulcher faces a gross misconduct hearing
 after Christopher Halliwell escaped prosecution for the murder of Becky
 Godden-Edwards, 20.

Halliwell confessed to the killing but was not tried as Det Supt Fulcher breached the Police and Criminal Evidence Act.

Halliwell is currently serving a life sentence for the murder of another girl, Sian O’Callaghan, 22.

London was the worst area for errors by police, with 568 potential criminals let free over five years.
