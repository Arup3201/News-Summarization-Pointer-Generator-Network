It's not quite panic stations, but Saturday's 2-1 defeat by Swansea in Louis van Gaal's first competitive game as manager highlighted deficiencies at Old Trafford.

The Dutchman and Ed Woodward have two weeks to act before the transfer window closes. They will be seeking to avoid another disastrous season, and here's who they're after, and what chance they have of capturing them.

Early worry: Saturday's 2-1 defeat to Swansea highlighted huge deficiencies in the United team

Down to business: Van Gaal has work to do before the transfer window closes on September 2

MARCOS ROJO

Club: Sporting Lisbon

Price: £16m to £30m

Van Gaal's new priority target. The left-sided centre back will allow United to bring the ball out of defence better and improve the balance of their team. Third party ownership is the obstacle but should be resolved. 

CHANCES: 9/10

Priority: Marcos Rojo (right) was promising at the World Cup for Argentina, and has a good chance of signing

KEVIN STROOTMAN

Club; Roma

Price: £25m to £80m

Strootman only returned to training last month after a serious knee injury and Roma's escalating valuation makes the deal a difficult one for United to complete. If fully fit, Strootman would prove the midfielder United sorely miss.

CHANCES: 7/10

Midfield general: The Dutchman knows Van Gaal, but has only just returned from a serious injury

ANGEL DI MARIA

Club: Real Madrid

Price: £50m

One of the best wingers in the world, who Van Gaal publicly hailed as one of the players he would like to have. However, the deal is extremely expensive and Carlo Ancelotti wants the Argentine to stay.

CHANCES: 1/10

Dreaming? £50m-rated Di Maria is drowned out with the talent at Real Madrid, but Carlo Ancelotti wants him

DALEY BLIND

Club: Ajax

Price: £17m

Blind brings something Van Gaal values in a squad, which is versatility. He can play left back, left wing back and defensive midfield. Has doubts in himself whether he could handle the physical side of the Premier League.

CHANCES: 6/10

Here and there: Versatile Dutchman Daley Blind would be a useful addition at Old Trafford

BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER

Club: Bayern Munich

Price: £15m

The Germany midfielder is one that has been discussed by United scouts and would be perfect but for his age having just turned 30. Played last season with knee injuries and is still recuperating but Bayern would sell.

CHANCES: 3/10

Happy: World Cup winner Schweinsteiger is a legend at Bayern, and the German side could sell

ARTURO VIDAL

Club: Juventus

Price: £35m

United have an interest in the Chile midfielder and know they could complete a deal should they wish to press ahead but there are too many concerns at this stage with the repair of Vidal's knee injury among them.

CHANCES: 1/10

Saga: Speculation surrounding Arturo Vidal's future has been rife during the summer
