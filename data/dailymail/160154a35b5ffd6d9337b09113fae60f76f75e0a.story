In a country that has always been subject to changeable weather conditions, you might have thought our public transport would, by now, be accustomed to it.

But whether it is too warm, too cold or too wet, transport in the UK still often struggles to cope.

This was proven yesterday when all trams in Nottinghamshire were cancelled due to frost on the lines.

Services were suspended because of frost on the rails but were resumed by 8am, albeit with persistent delays

All early morning tram services were forced to stop and replacement bus services put in their place because ‘ice had built up on overhead lines’.

Nottingham Express Transit (NET) said the trams could not run because they could not pick up power properly on the first night that temperatures had gone to -6C for the first time this year.

Trams get their power from electric lines suspended above their route. They are connected to the wires at all times by a mechanism which stretches from their roof and collects the electricity.

Because of the layer of frost on the wires, the connection between wire and tram was broken and the vehicles were unable to collect enough electricity to power their engines.

Trams were reintroduced just before 8am but there were still delays to services until late morning.

Richard John Salter posted on Facebook saying it was ‘unbelievable’ for the service to fail due to the ‘first proper frost’.

Peter Miles said: ‘So like the too many leaves on railway lines, our wonderful trams cannot operate in the winter when the temperature drops to freezing?’

Indeed, it is not just cold weather that has been known to cause travel disruption in the UK.

In Autumn-months trains have been known to be severely delayed due simply to ‘leaves on the line’. 

And in the summer, warm weather has been blamed by operators who have cancelled services due to the wrong type of soil.

In 2011, Network Rail cancelled First Capital Connect services between Ely, Cambridge, Downham Market and Norfolk because dry soil has caused the rails to shift.

In the same year, Chiltern Railways scrapped its service from Saunderton, Buckininghamshire to London because the train is too big for the platform.

This followed the decision of the company to add a seventh carriage to the service to ease overcrowding, not realising it would be too big for Saunderton station.

Also in 2011, travellers hoping to alight at Shepley in West Yorkshire were unable to reach their destination after West Yorkshire Police received a call from a woman who thought she saw a lion.
