Amid the blood and the thunder, a moment of real quality. Thanks to Shaun Maloney's right instep Scotland continue down the qualification route with hope refreshed.

For 75 minutes here at breathless Celtic Park, we had been given what we expected. Non-stop football low on persistent quality but high on endeavour and adrenaline.

There were some good players on show in Glasgow, though, and, with 15 minutes left, one of them stepped forward to deliver the decisive blow that leaves both these nations in the mix for qualification for France 2016.

Scotland – the better team in the first half – had actually just weathered a dangerous spell from a rejuvenated Ireland when a header from Jon Walters on to his own crossbar and over earned them a corner on the left.

Previously, Irish goalkeeper David Forde had plucked Scottish set-pieces out of the air with comfort. This time, though, the ball was played low to Scott Brown and when the Scotland captain laid it in to the path of Maloney the curling shot in to the far corner was exquisite and unstoppable.

Scotland manager Gordon Strachan thanked one his coaches, Stuart McCall, for a routine straight from the training ground. The pretty patterns laid out on paper need executing when the stakes are high, though, and moments like this one can define careers.

Maloney is a technically talented footballer but one currently playing near the foot of the Championship with Wigan. At almost 32, he may fear his best days are behind him.

His goal, though, his moment of supreme calm amid the chaos, has given Scotland something to cling to in a group that looks as though it will last the distance. As such – with games against Gibraltar and a return against Ireland to come in the first half of next year – Maloney's season all of a sudden becomes something more than a scrap against gravity in the English football pyramid.

On Friday night Maloney was his country's best player alongside Everton's Steven Naismith. This was not a game devoid of quality altogether but these two provided more of it than most.

'They were brave,' said Strachan.

'Little men in a physical game, where the ball was fizzing about and tackles were flying in.

'As a spectacle this was mesmerising.

'The fans made it special and the players wanted to jump higher, run faster and tackle harder.

'It was like a big heavyweight boxing match.'

Narrowly, Scotland deserved their win. They could have been reduced to ten men in the first half when Grant Hanley followed a yellow card with a reckless leap at Forde. As it was, he remained on the field and it was the Blackburn defender's header against his own bar in injury time that came closest to giving Martin O'Neill's team an equaliser.

O'Neill will not panic about this loss. His team's chances of qualification probably lie in a home programme next calendar year that sees Scotland come to the Aviva Stadium as well as Georgia and group favourites Poland and Germany.

Nevertheless, he knows his team didn't play as well as they can on Friday night.

Ireland were the better team for the first 15 minutes of each half. Only in the second, though, did they create chances, Aiden McGeady coming to life as Scotland goalkeeper David Marshall saved from him and from centre forward Shane Long. The second chance – a header from six yards – really should have gone in.

That apart, Scotland were on top. Much of their football was hurried. When they did play, however, they were progressive. Naismith was terrific behind main striker Steven Fletcher while either side of the Everton player Maloney and Watford's Ikechi Anya were dangerous.

Had Fletcher shown a little more quality and, at times, a sharper instinct, Scotland may have led earlier. The Sunderland player headed an early corner over and another first half chance wide. When Anya crossed low from the left near half-time, meanwhile, Fletcher was caught on his heels.

As the stalemate dragged on, so the intensity of the game raised.

The crowd had been rather quiet before kick-off but they were soon sucked deep in to the importance, the needs-must nature, of the game.

Refereed well by the Serbian official, there were yellow cards but thankfully no red. The tackles were robust but rarely cynical. It was a game that deserved to finish with eleven playing eleven.

Midway through the second period, things got a bit much for O'Neill's assistant Roy Keane. He has had a long week. Lectured for his boisterousness by the referee, he responded with a sarcastic salute but moments later he had something tangible to worry about as Scotland surged in to the lead.

'I thought we deserved a draw,' said O'Neill afterwards.

'We were comfortable and I thought we would get something out of it.'

With Poland winning in Georgia, both these teams still face a challenge to get out of this group. This, though, was an enormous result for the Scots.

England will face a team with their tails up here on Tuesday.
