Lance Armstrong has pleaded guilty to hitting two parked cars with his SUV in Aspen and then leaving the scene without reporting the incident.

Armstrong's girlfriend, Anna Hansen, originally told police she was behind the wheel in the December 28 accident in icy conditions but later confessed that she lied to avoid media attention. She said it was a 'joint decision' between them for her to take responsibility for the crash. 

The cyclist entered his plea by mail on Friday under a plea agreement with prosecutors, closing the case and avoiding a court appearance.

Armstrong was due to appear in court on March 17.

Court records show Armstrong paid $238.50 to cover court fees and a $150 fine.

Deputy District Attorney Andrea Bryan said that it is fairly common for people to reach plea deals in such cases and to enter pleas by mail.

Careless driving can be punished by up to 90 days in jail but Bryan says jail time is rare.

Hansen was initially cited, having told officers that, while driving the couple back home from an Aspen Art Museum party and going too fast for the snowy conditions.

She said she lost control of her vehicle and struck two parked cars before speaking to the owner and offering to pay for the damage.

One of the officers involved said due to suspicions over this story, he then spoke to a valet for the art museum party, who told him it had been Armstrong who had driven away from the event.

The report added that Hansen subsequently admitted she had been the passenger and that Armstrong had been the driver.

Hansen is quoted in the report as saying that her taking the blame had been 'a joint decision' between her and Armstrong made in a bid to avoid negative headlines.

The charges were transferred to the 43-year-old former cyclist.

Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour de France victories and banned for life from racing in 2012 after he admitted using performance-enhancing drugs.
