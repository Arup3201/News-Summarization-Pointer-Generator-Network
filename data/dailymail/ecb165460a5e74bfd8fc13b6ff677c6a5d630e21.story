The only film poster ever to show the Phantom of the Opera's unmasked face has sold for $200,000.

The poster was printed in 1925 to promote the release of Universal Studios' film about a deformed composer who terrorises an opera house in Paris after falling in love with an opera singer.

Swedish artist Gustaf Tenggren designed four posters ahead of the film's release but only one revealed the disfigured face of the Phantom.

For sale: The 90-year-old film poster which is the only one ever to show the Phantom of the Opera's unmasked face

It shows the Phantom lurking in the waters of the catacombs waiting to pounce on the partner of his object of desire, opera singer Christine.

It is the only poster ever made in which the Phantom's disfigured face is unmasked, and original examples are considered among the most rare film posters on the market.

The poster which sold is one of only four in existence worldwide, one of which is held by Universal Studios themselves.

It was once owned by Hollywood actor Nicolas Cage.

The 41ins by 27ins poster was sold at Heritage Auctions in Dallas, Texas, on behalf of a private collector.

It was snapped up for $200,000 - $34,000  more than was estimated.

Grey Smith, director of movie posters at Heritage, said: 'In the 1920s Universal were the kings of horror thanks to their success with The Hunchback of Notre Dame which starred Lon Chaney.

'In 1924 Carl Laemmle, Universal's president, was looking for a follow-up hit and turned to Gaston Leroux's novel The Phantom of the Opera.

'Chaney was cast again to play the disfigured composer who falls in love with, and then kidnaps, a rising opera star.

'Four designs of poster were made for the film but only one - the one we have for sale - gave a glimpse of the Phantom's face without his famous mask.

'It is regarded by collectors as by far the best Phantom of the Opera poster for that reason.

'Only three other examples of this poster exist worldwide so it is incredibly rare and hugely sought after.

'Its history is not clear but at some point in the 1990s it was bought by Nicolas Cage before being sold on again to another private collector.

'It is in incredible condition - the colours are as bright as the day they were printed.

'It is simply a glorious image that for collectors of film posters would be a key piece to their collection.'
