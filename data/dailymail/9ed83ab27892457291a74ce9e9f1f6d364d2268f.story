On their first date, Tony Abbott wouldn't stop talking about the split between the ALP (Australian Labor Party) and the DLP (Democratic Labor Party) in the mid-1950s. 

Later on in their courtship, he would take her trekking down the Kokoda Trail - with a mate in tow - and would lavish her with bouquets of roses.  

Margie Abbott, Australia's so-called 'First Lady', has opened about how she was wooed by the future PM in an interview published in the latest issue of The Australian Women's Weekly.

Mrs Abbott (with husband Tony) told Women's Weekly how Mr Abbott wooed her in the late 1980s - with champagne, roses, and discussions about politics

The pair first met on a blind date at a Sydney tavern around 1987 - and six months later he would propose to her in an inner-Sydney restaurant, the pair celebrating with French champagne. 

'I think we'd both pretty quickly made the decision that we'd met somebody we wanted to spend the rest of our lives with,' Mrs Abbott told the Weekly. 

The interview was a rare public moment of candour for Mrs Abbott, who has mostly managed to keep out of the limelight throughout her husband's federal political career of more than two decades.

However, she has become noticeably more prominent in Mr Abbott's public appearances since he faced the humiliating prospect of a leadership spill motion in mid-February. 

In the Weekly interview, the Kiwi-born Mrs Abbott also faced questions about current political issues. 

She declined to answer questions about her thoughts on the Prime Minister dumping his much-touted paid parental leave scheme. 

Mrs Abbott, who works with a number of charities, has fulfilled her role as 'First Lady' at official functions. Here she is on Wednesday with her husband, greeting Vietnam's Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung and Madame Tran Thanh Kiem

Peta Credlin (pictured), Tony Abbott's chief of staff, has been the target of several Liberal party members because of her controversial management style

Mr Abbott has promised a 'better deal' for parents with child care in his next Budget (which he said this week would be 'much more boring' than last year's). 

Asked about Peta Credlin - the leader's chief of staff who was a central issue among several Liberal MPs in the recent Liberal Party turmoil - Mrs Abbott told the Weekly she juggled a difficult job. 

Ms Credlin has come under sustained public attack since late last year. 

The ABC's Four Corners program this week published a text message sent by Liberal Party treasurer Phil Higginson which described her as 'the horsewoman of the apocalypse' and sought her removal. 

'At the end of the day, Peta works incredibly hard and it's a tough job,' Mrs Abbott said. This month's edition of The Australian Women's Weekly is on sale now.
