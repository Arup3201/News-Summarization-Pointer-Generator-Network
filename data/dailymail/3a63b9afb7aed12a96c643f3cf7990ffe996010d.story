A young actor was found dead after a thug who tortured him for 14 hours was released from prison, it has been revealed.

Jamie Morrison’s body was discovered at his flat in Edinburgh last Tuesday, the day after he missed the premiere of his first big screen film.

His mother, Margaret, has now revealed the 27-year-old chose to take his own life rather than live in fear of a man who had subjected him to a brutal attack two years ago.

Billey Harvie was released from jail after serving half of his three-year sentence for attacking Mr Morrison while he was holding him captive.

The 24-year-old is said to have slashed and beaten Jamie during the ordeal.

Margaret revealed her son's torment on the day of the talented actor's funeral. The Daily Record quotes her as saying: ‘My beautiful boy is gone because he was frightened and he just couldn’t take it any more. 

‘After Harvie got out of prison, he just didn’t feel safe. I am heartbroken. He was so loved and was such a talented, wonderful boy.’

Mr Morrison had recently landed a role in Skeletons - a short movie directed by Craig-James Moncur.

The film got its  first showing at the Edinburgh Filmhouse on Monday night at an event attended by notable figures from the Scottish film industry.

Mr Moncur, whose television acting credits include Looking After JoJo, said they had tried to reach Mr Morrison on the night only to learn of his death the following morning.

He later described Mr Morrison as having 'an infectious enthusiasm that really rubbed off on others'. 

Harvie was released from prison in April and reportedly returned to ‘Welcome Home’ banners. Mr Morrison later moved addresses to the other side of the city.

Harvie was jailed for three years at Edinburgh Sheriff Court in February 2013 after being convicted of the attack on Mr Morrison – but was let out after 14 months with some of his sentence backdated because of time he had already spent in custody.

The Daily Record reports that he returned to jail again later and was finally released in late summer.

Mr Morrison suffered severe injuries in the attack while his mother likened the flat to a ‘a murder scene’ after the incident with blood ‘all over the walls’.

He needed stitches to his face and suffered permanent scarring and post-traumatic stress, the Daily Record reports.

His mother, 46, told the newspaper: ‘He is dead because of what happened to him.’

Friends of Mr Morrison said the attack had wrecked his life and left him feeling worried and paranoid.

A tribute page including photographs of Mr Morrison has been set up by his cousin Helen Quilietti Stanton.

She wrote on the page: 'This page is in memory of my cousin Jamie Stuart Morrison who has tragically died aged only 27 years old on 25th November 2014. 

'Our hearts bleed in sadness at his passing but we will honour his life.'

After his death, his sister, Jodie, 26, left a message on a social media website saying: 'Jamie I love you, I’ll never stop loving you.' 

Hundreds packed Edinburgh’s Liberton Northfield Parish Church for a funeral yesterday.
