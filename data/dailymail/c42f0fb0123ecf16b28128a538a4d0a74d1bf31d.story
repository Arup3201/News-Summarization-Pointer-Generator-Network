Roberto Martinez has admitted he is unsure when Ross Barkley will make a return to first-team action.

Barkley missed Everton's opening Premier League 2-2 draw at Leicester on Saturday after suffering a knee injury in training.

The England international's knee is still swollen and Martinez says the club can't make an estimate on his recovery until that has reduced.

Big blow: Martinez says Barkley will undergo a further scan on his knee injury in the next couple of days

Barkley is currently in a knee brace and will undergo a further scan on the injury in the next couple of days.

Speaking to the club's official club website Martinez said: 'His knee has reacted really well to treatment.

'I don't know where the figure of five months [in the papers] came from but obviously the extent of the injury is a little unsure at the moment because we don't know how the next two weeks are going to develop.

'It's a medial ligament injury and we know that Ross, in terms of the power and the strength that he has in his body, he could easily react to treatment a lot better than other players.

'The length that Ross will be out is a little uncertain at the moment and it could be anything between the eight weeks that we mentioned or a little further. Until the end of the week, or probably the next 10 days, we won't know how the knee is progressing and how quickly Ross can be back.'
