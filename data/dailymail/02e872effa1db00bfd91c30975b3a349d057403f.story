Peter Redding drowned when he swam across the River Thames for a £200 bet

A high-flying car salesman drowned when he attempted to swim across the River Thames for a £200 bet while on a night out drinking with his workmates, a coroner heard today.

Peter Redding, 34, was celebrating a successful week of sales at the pub in Henley-on-Thames was followed by a trip to an Indian restaurant.

The Audi car sales executive died after he stripped down to his boxer shorts and tried to swim across the fast-moving River Thames, an inquest into his death heard.

It came after colleagues wagered a £200 bet over whether someone could successfully swim across the river.

Mr Redding, who was also an amateur musician and talented guitar player, disappeared beneath the water when he was half way across.

His worried friends called 999 and his body found was found by a police diver the following morning.

Devastated work colleagues told a coroner how they had been out drinking in Henley-on-Thames, after 11pm on July 26 last year.

Mr Redding, who was described as a 'loveable rogue' by his heartbroken mother following his death, worked at an Audi car branch in Reading, Berkshire.

He and a dozen work mates had gone to the The Angel on the Bridge public house in Henley and drank several pints of strong lager, before going to eat a curry and consume more drinks - including a bottle of champagne - at the Spice Merchant restaurant in the town.

The group returned to The Angel on the Bridge, where they ordered more beers and a round of Tequila shots before the bet was made while they were in the riverside pub’s beer garden.

'We were outside for a while when the topic of conversation came up about how much it would cost for someone to swim across the river,' said Audi salesman Lee Allum in a statement read out at Oxford Coroner’s Court today.

He said: 'About £200 was put on the table for a bit of fun. I’m not exactly sure how much money was on the table but it was taken back quite quickly.

'Peter is a very determined person. When he gets something in his head, he doesn’t let it go.'

Mr Allum said Mr Redding 'walked off' and someone told him they had seen him undressing on the bridge before entering the water.

He went to the bridge and got out his mobile phone to film his co-worker taking on the challenge and said: 'I could see Peter was half-way across. I moved along the bridge to get a better place.

'I could see Peter. I got my mobile phone out and started to record Peter. He seemed to still be swimming but he was getting nowhere.

'He looked like he was struggling. I called out to him but there was no response.'

Mr Redding soon disappeared from view and his colleagues began to worry for his safety, Mr Allum said.

'Another person had come to the top of the bridge and said, "Lee, there’s no sign of Peter.'

Another colleague, Ross Ford, told the coroner: 'When we were looking into the river, I couldn’t see him. I called the emergency services.

'I couldn’t see anything. The river was clam and I couldn’t see any ripples or anything.'

Mr Redding’s body was found by police diver PC Mark Rodham shortly after 9am the following morning.

The inquest was attended by Mr Redding’s mother Teresa Beddis, aged 62 years who had the grim duty of identifying her son’s body.

A pathologist who performed a post-mortem examination on Mr Redding’s body concluded he had drowned.

Also at the hearing was Mr Redding’s long-term girlfriend Rachel Weyl, aged 45 years.

He treated her daughter Abbey, aged nine years, as one of his own.

Miss Weyl sobbed as Oxfordshire assistant coroner Nicholas Graham recorded an accidental death verdict.

The coroner said: 'This was simply an accident. It was an unintended consequence of his actions. It does not imply any liability to anybody.

'I’m satisfied on the evidence that on the night of July 26, Mr Redding had consumed alcohol with his friends, and drowned when he attempted to swim across the Thames.'

Speaking after the hearding his mother, Mrs Beddis said: 'Peter’s death was a tragedy but he lived his life to the full and has left us with some wonderful friends and memories.'

At his funeral in August, his mother paid tribute to her son as a ‘loveable rogue' and that he had made her 'very proud.'

He had a disabled brother David, who died aged when he was aged six years. He also left behind his sister Cara Redding, aged 26 years.

Mr Redding got his first guitar aged eight years old and played in a number of bands in Reading, Berks.

He had held a donor card since he was 16 and his retinas and heart valves were used in transplant operations for babies and children.

Speaking at his funeral, Mrs Beddis said: 'He will go on as part of someone else’s life and for that I’m grateful. The boy who left at 17 turned into a man who made me very proud.'

She also told how he relished the opportunity to play a big role in bringing up Miss Weyl’s nine-year-old daughter Abbey.

'He loved Rachel and told me on many occasions how happy he was,' she said.
