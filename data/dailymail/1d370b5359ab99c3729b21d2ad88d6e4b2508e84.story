Manuel Pellegrini has hailed Wilfried Bony as the ‘perfect player’ for his squad as the £28million striker prepares to make his debut for Manchester City against Newcastle on Saturday evening.

Bony scored nine goals for Swansea in the first half of the season after netting 25 times for the Welsh club during the previous campaign and Pellegrini believes the forward’s familiarity with his surroundings will see him make a strong start to his career at the Etihad Stadium.

‘I think that Bony will be an important player for us,’ the Chilean manager said. ‘He will be in the squad list we will see if he will be in the starting 11 or after that have some minutes but he works with our team the whole week without any problems.

City boss Manuel Pellegrini has described the Ivory Coast international as the 'perfect player' for his squad

City now have the top four goal scorers from the Premier League last year:

1. Wilfried Bony - 18

2. Sergio Aguero - 16

3. Edin Dzeko - 14

4. Yaya Toure - 14

5. Daniel Sturridge - 13

6. Wayne Rooney - 13 

‘He plays a lot of years here in England, he is the player that scores most goals during the last year.

‘I think he has all the conditions to be an important player because we try always to play with two strikers. He is the perfect player for our squad.

'He knows the Premier League, he knows our team so I think it will be easy for him to settle in in a good way.

‘We always play with a lot of movement so our strikers always have the freedom to choose in the best place they must be in every play.

‘He can play with Sergio Aguero, he can play with Edin Dzeko, he can play with Stevan Jovetic, he can play with David Silva - he can play with all the players in our team.’

One player Bony cannot play with on Saturday is James Milner with the England midfielder suffering with a knee problem

Pellegrini described the problem as not serious but said Milner was a doubt for Tuesday’s Champions League tie with Barcelona, a particular concern given that Yaya Toure is suspended for the last 16 tie.

‘He is talking with the doctor about all the situations,’ Pellegrini said. ‘I don’t think it will be very serious. We’ll see how he improves in the next days.’
