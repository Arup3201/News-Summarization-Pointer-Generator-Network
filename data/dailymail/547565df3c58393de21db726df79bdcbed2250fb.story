Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal praised the attitude of defender Luke Shaw after the teenage defender came through 45 minutes against Inter Milan despite not being match fit.

Van Gaal revealed on Monday that Shaw, 19, has been struggling for match fitness and the England international trained on his own in the hour leading up to United’s game at FedExField as he was not expected to be used.

But an injury to young replacement Reece James left United with a problem and Van Gaal said of Shaw: 'He is working very hard and he was lucky tonight.

'Normally we would play Reece James but he was injured. So I asked Luke if he would play.

'He did a very hard training session this morning but he said he would play and he still did very well.'

United were the better team against the Italians but had to rely on a penalty shootout after drawing 0-0. United scored all their penalties, with Darren Fletcher scoring the winner.

Van Gaal said: 'Yesterday Fletcher hit the post in practice. It's luck but we deserved the win I think.

'I’m pleased. We played better than our other games on tour.

'We played well and conceded only one shot on goal. We created six or seven chances and that means it’s 7-1.

'I was very pleased with our ball possession. It was much better and we covered our positions better. I was very pleased with my players tonight.'

Van Gaal also revealed after the game that he was in the market for new defenders.

He added: 'We have conceded zero goals and then one wonder goal and a penalty.

'We have conceded zero goals today. We are doing well but we are looking for defenders.

'Defenders have gone and we have to replace them.

'But I like Tyler Blackett and Michael Keane. We have to see if we can play more matches like today.

'Inter and Roma are in preparation but the Premier League will be different.'

So far so good: Louis van Gaal was in high spirits along with his assistants
