Secret Service agents were told to break protocol and let actor Bradley Cooper's unscreened vehicle into an off-limits area at a dinner honoring the president last year in Washington, D.C., a new book claims.

An agent allegedly told author Ronald Kessler that Cooper was allowed to ride his vehicle up to the front door of the Washington Hilton on the night of the White House Correspondents Dinner in 2013 and bypass a regular sweep for explosives.

All other vehicles - with the exception of Secret Service and their protectees - were required to approach the dinner site from drop-off point a block away.

' " Agents were told not to sweep the car. Just let it in and don't give Cooper any problems," 'a Secret Service agent is quoted as saying of the incident in an excerpt of Kessler's forthcoming book, The First Family Detail, obtained by MailOnline.

" 'Bradley Cooper had a free pass to come through the main entrance and drive right up to the front of the hotel.' "

Author Ron Kessler says that the Secert Service allowed actor Bradley Cooper to be dropped off at the doors of the 2013 House Correspondents Dinner in the Ford Expedition in this photo. Every one else attending the dinner - with the exception of the president and other Secret Service protectees - had to be dropped off a block away from the dinner site for security reasons

'Free pass': A Secret Service agent allegedly told Kessler that Cooper, pictured here at an after party for the dinner, was allowed to bypass normal protocol because a 'high-ranking agency official from New York' called in a personal favor

' "The agents were blown away when they were told to forget everything they were told to do," 'the Secret Service agent reportedly told Kessler.' "And this was two weeks after the terrorist attack on our soil." '

Usually, the agent said, all vehicles that come through a security checkpoint, including those that belong to the Secret Service, are inspected by a canine team. But Bradley Cooper's vehicle was not, putting the president and party guests at risk.

' "Bradley Cooper was not subject to the same requirements that apply to me as an agent," ' he reportedly said.

Kessler, a New York times bestselling author who has written 20 books, says the Secret Service agents were asked to give The Hangover star preferential treatment as a 'personal favor' to a 'high-ranking agency official in New York' and obliged out of fear of 'retribution from management.'

'The pressure not to rock the boat takes president over protecting the president' from potential assassins, Kessler writes in The First Family Detail.

' "Agents were told just let Bradley through," ' the Secret Service agent allegedly told him. ' "The agents did as they were told and let Cooper's vehicle through out of fear of repercussions.

' "That's just one example of the arrogance of senior managers in the Secret Service. They think they're accountable to no one." '

Cooper arrived at the hotel before the president, but his vehicle still presented a security threat, the agent told Kessler, because it could have remained in the driveway right up to the moment the president's motorcade showed up.

A publicist for Cooper did not return a request for comment, Kessler says.

The First Family Detail: Secret Service Agents Reveal the Hidden Lives of the Presidents will be released in stores next Tuesday, August 5.
