Fiorentina scored three goals in the opening 22 minutes to set up a 3-0 away win over struggling Roma to secure their place in the Europa League quarter-finals, with the all-Italian match-up finishing 4-1 on aggregate.

Roma's season is falling apart, with the team having fallen 14 points behind Serie A leader Juventus in the Italian league and at risk of losing second place.

A late sending-off for Adem Ljajic for a second yellow card capped a dispiriting night which saw about a hundred of the club's `ultras' leave the Stadio Olimpico after 30 minutes, by which time Roma had conceded three times in a 13-minute span.

Gonzalo Rodriguez converted a retaken penalty in the ninth minute, after a number of players encroached into the box for the first attempt. Marcos Alonso capitalized on a goalkeeping error to make it 2-0 in the 18th and Jose Maria Basanta headed in when unmarked in the 22nd.

Roma captain Francesco Totti, goalkeeper Morgan de Sanctis and midfielder Danielle de Rossi led the rest of the team's players over to talk to fans after match. Totti spoke for a long while with the head of the `ultras.'
