Cricketer and Strictly Come Dancing winner Darren Gough has confirmed he has split from his wife after Towie star Amy Childs was forced to deny they had an affair.

The 43-year-old former England fast bowler met the model, who is 20 years younger, while filming Channel 4 reality show The Jump abroad in January.

Mr Gough has left the family home near Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, which he shares with common law wife Anna, after developing a 'close friendship' with Miss Childs while in Austria.

Close: Darren Gough and Amy Childs became 'good friends' while filming Channel 4 show The Jump in Austria and today the cricketer confirmed he has split from his wife Anna

Off out:  Amy Childs leaves her house in Essex this afternoon but did not stop to talk to reporters

Moved out: Gough has left the family home he shared with wife Anna and their two sons near Milton Keynes. They divorced in 2002 but got back together five years ago

The talkSPORT presenter said in a statement: 'In response to the stories in today's press I can confirm that I am no longer in a relationship with Anna. However, we remain close friends and committed parents to our children.

'We will not be making any further comments on this and politely ask that you please respect our family's privacy at this time.'

The cricketer’s separation from
 wife Anna – with whom he is a parent to sons Liam and Brennan – comes 
five years after they reconciled following a divorce in 2002 after eight
 years of marriage.

After they split for the first time he said: 'The divorce 
was good for me.

'It made me grow up. I have changed a lot since then. 
When I was younger I thought that playing cricket, taking wickets and 
making money was all there was to life. I was wrong. There's more than 
that, but sometimes you don't find that out until it's too late'.

It came as their was speculation about his friendship with Miss Childs.

Today her spokesman said: 'Amy and Darren met while filming for The Jump, they
became good friends during filming and remain so, they have never been involved
in a relationship'.

A
 friend of Miss Childs told MailOnline they 'became close' and had a 
'great time together' but have not seen each other since returning from 
Austria.

In a statement Gough confirmed he had split from his wife, but said 'we remain close friends and committed parents to our children'

'Amy thought he was charismatic and 
charming, and they got on really well, but he is not her type. He is 20 
years older than her,' the friend said.

'She is really upset to be labelled with this because they are not in a relationship and they haven't seen each other since they got back'.

Nobody answered Mr Gough's family home today and no cars were parked on its grand pebble drive.

The detached house is walled off from the road with tall wooden gates, and sits on a picturesque country road. 

On The Jump the Mr Gough and Miss Childs
 were axed in quick succession – with Childs eliminated on January 27 
and Gough making a similar exit the following day.

They
 have maintained regular contact via Twitter following their brief 
appearance on the Channel 4 show – and a pal of the former TOWIE star 
admits they 'got close' on the snowy slopes of Innsbruck. 

‘Amy denies they have slept together but admits there are feelings there,' a friend told The Sun's Dan Wooton.

‘She’s
 not the sort of girl to sleep with a married man. She didn’t cross that
 line. They were flirting and would hug on nights out. But she thinks 
it’s unfair that she’s being blamed for any issues in Darren’s 
relationship.’

Miss Childs is being comforted by her mother at her Essex house today.

Miss Childs was picked up from her home in Essex by her family in their van following the affair allegations

Denial: A spokesman for Miss Childs said that she and Gough 'became good friends during filming and remain so' but insisted they have never been involved in a relationship

At home: Amy Childs was in her Essex house today with her mother as she denied any relationship with Darren Gough

The star spent some of the morning at her Brentwood salon before returning home.

Wearing a yellow tunic and her red shoulder-length hair loose, she ran out of a people carrier and straight into the house with a friend.

Shortly afterwards her mother, who lives on the same street, arrived in a black Audi.

Her white Range Rover - with the plate ‘Well Jell’ after her TOWIE catchphrase - is parked outside and the home is gated with a coded entrance.

A show insider claims Darren and Amy’s friendship blossomed shortly after they arrived in Austria to film the show.

‘The cast went on a huge booze bender on their second night in Innsbruck and Amy and Darren were being really flirty,’ a source told The Sun. 

‘The more they drank, the more obvious it was that they fancied each other. They were being very affectionate.’

Meanwhile Amy has been single following her split from personal trainer David Peters in May 2013.

Calling
 it a day: Amy Childs and David Peters ended their relationship following rows  last year

In the past: Kirk had declared that he will 'always love' Amy, who he dated during their time together on The Only Way Is Essex

Their relationship ended after months of rows, it emerged at the time.

The Towie star and her 27-year-old partner were together for a year but had reportedly been arguing since Amy's ex Kirk Norcross publicly declared his undying love for the red-headed beautician last April.

The final straw came when David discovered that Amy was still in touch with Kirk - with the pair frequently sending each other text messages.
