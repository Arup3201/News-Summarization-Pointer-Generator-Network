It looks just like any other wedding photo with happy faces smiling back at the camera.

But look closely and you will see the sinister face of a killer standing just feet away from one of his victim's relatives, who had no idea her family member had been murdered.

The picture has remained hidden in a family album for years and was discovered by Tracey Mullane, aunt of Becky Godden-Edwards, in her loft last week. 

Now the 49-year-old has spoken of her 
shock at realising that she was at the same wedding as Christopher Halliwell -
the man who confessed to her niece's murder.

Speaking to the Sunday Mirror, Ms Mullane said: 'I felt sick to the stomach because he looks so insignificant and acted normally throughout that day, seemingly without a care in the world, appearing as nothing happened to him.'

Ms Mullane spoke to the police and confirmed Halliwell was in the photo.

She said: 'I told them he had an evil look about him and of course, I know that's the case. He is evil.' 

Less that two years after the photograph was taken at the Swindon De Vere Hotel in 2008, Halliwell, a taxi-driver, would murder again.

This time his victim was Sian O'Callaghan, a clubber on her way home from a night out in Swindon, Wiltshire.

Halliwell was arrested and led police to the spot where he buried Sian in a shallow grave.

But he shocked detectives when he told them he could lead them to another body in return for a cigarette. 

Halliwell was jailed for life after pleading guilty to Sian's murder.

But there would be no justice for Becky after a judge ruled that Halliwell's legal rights had been breached by detectives during the course of the search.

Becky's family may never know exactly how, when or why she died but her family have vowed to continue searching for justice.

Becky, a heroin addict since she was 16, walked away from her family on December 17, 2002.

The 
20-year-old told her mum Karen Edwards: 'I love you, but I can't put you
through this anymore. It's not fair on you. I'll come back when I'm clean.' But she never did.

'I told them he had an evil look about him and of course, I know that's the case. He is evil'

Police officers finally arrived at Karen's home in April 2011, on what would have been Becky's 29th birthday, and told her that Becky's remains had been found in a field.

She had been dead for at least six years.

Ms Mullane, who found the photo in her loft, decided to show the picture to Becky's mother Karen, who was shocked that Halliwell acted normal at the wedding despite hiding his secret that he had killed Becky.
