Most people know lengthy, pretentious restaurant menus will hit you in the pocket - and now a major study has set the price at 11p per letter.

Linguistics professor Dan Jurafsky came up with his claim after spending months analysing 6,500 menus, from Michelin-starred enclaves to cheap roadside diners.

He said restaurants with longer, more complicated words in their descriptions would cost punters more, while cheap eateries tended to choose generic words such as 'tasty' and 'hearty'.

Tough to digest: Long words on menus are a provable sign of high prices, says a study. Raymond Blanc's (left) Oxfordshire restaurant has lengthy words, as does the flasghip Chelsea diner by Gordon Ramsay (right)

His research is published in a book called The Language of Food: A Linguist Reads the Menu and includes his observations on a wide range of culinary language.

Only cheap diners feel the need to tell their customers the food is 'real', he writes, while expensive ones are more likely to tell their customers where it comes from.

It was not so much the length of the menu description that was important, but the words within it.

Cheap restaurants had rambling descriptions but which used easy-to-understand words, while expensive ones tended to be more to-the-point but with more obscure and lengthy culinary terms. 

By analysing 650,000 dishes in the 6,500 menus he found online, Prof Jurafsky, of California's Stanford University, calculated a menu with longer words would cost 18 cents (11p) more for every extra letter within them on average.

Costly: A study claims longer words in restaurant menus add 11p per letter to the price. Pictured is Raymond Blanc's restaurant Le Manoir aux Quat’Saisons, where dishes like assiette (plate) of piglet cost £54

Wordy: Customers at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay in Chelsea, where three courses cost £95, can expect 'Isle of Gigha halibut with Atlantic King crab, cauliflower couscous, finger lime and ras el hanout infused broth'

He told The Sunday Times high-paying customers liked to be reminded that they were highly educated with lengthy or obscure menu descriptions.

'You're flattering your customers, but it's also a bit of showing off,' he told the newspaper. 'Cheap places can't do it because the diners want to know what they're getting.' 

Raymond Blanc's Le Manoir aux Quat’Saisons in Oxfordshire, touted as Britain's priciest restaurant, certainly lives up to the theory - up to a point. 

Exception: Heston Blumenthal's elaborate dishes have names such as 'meat fruit' and 'snail porridge'

Its menu has words which would make many diners furrow their brows, including agnolotti (filled pasta similar to ravioli) of goat’s cheese for £42, assiette (plate) of piglet for £54 and Manjari (Madagascan) chocolate and raspberry chocolate for £28. 

Those without such deep pockets can head to the Oxford branch of Harvester, for the more humble 'juicy' bangers and mash (£4.99) or 'Tasty, flame-grilled chicken breast, served with a fluffy jacket potato and buttered peas' (£5.99).

Compare that to Restaurant Gordon Ramsay in Chelsea, London, where three courses cost £95 - plus a 12.5 per cent service charge.

Meals there include 'Isle of Gigha halibut with Atlantic King crab, cauliflower couscous, finger lime and ras el hanout infused broth', 'Fillet of sea bass with shellfish and sea vegetable minestrone, coco de paimpol, fennel and lovage', and 'Ravioli of lobster, langoustine and salmon poached in a light bisque with oscietra caviar and sorrel velouté'.

Marco Pierre White's restaurant Belvedere in Holland Park, west London, also uses exotic words - though its mostly resists telling its diners where there food has come from.

Dish names there stick resolutely to describing the ingredients, which are expensive enough by themselves.

The names range wildly from 'ballotine of guineafowl, petits pois a la Franciase and tarragon jus' (£18.50) to 'fillet of sea bass, spiced peppers, aubergine caviar, basil oil' (£19.50).

There are some notable exceptions to Prof Jurafsky's rules, however.

Heston Blumenthal's Fat Duck in Bray, Bershire - where the tasting menu costs £220 per person - has famously pithy names for its dishes including simply 'snail porridge'.

And at the TV chef's Dinner by Heston Blumenthal in Kensington, west London, names include 'meat fruit', 'rice & flesh' and 'savoury porridge'.

That could explain why they're all around the 'cheap' price tag of £17 - by a celebrity chef's standards, at least.
