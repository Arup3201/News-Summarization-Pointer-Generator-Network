He's single and he's looking for love.

But, to win his heart, you'd have to accept his rather unconventional lifestyle.

Amou Haji has not washed for 60 years, because he believes being clean will make him sick, and his favourite food is rotten porcupine.

Smoking hot: The man who hasn't bathed for 60 years, Amou Haji, pictured here smoking his pipe

To relax he likes to sit down and have a smoke, from a pipe packed with animal faeces.

Mr Haji, 80, says he chose this way of life after going through some emotional setbacks in his youth and since then - perhaps unsurprisingly - he has become a bit isolated.

His home is in Dejgah village in the southern province of Fars in Iran where, once, a group of young men offered to give him a shower - but luckily he managed to escape.

At night he either sleeps in a hole in the ground, which is quite like a grave, or in an open brick shack which concerned locals built for him.

Young, single, looking for love? But Mr Haji also believes being clean will make him sick

As well as cleanliness, Mr Haji also has an aversion to clean food and drink. He much prefers the rotten meat of dead animals and five litres of water a day from a rusty oil can.

But don't think Mr Haji doesn't look after himself - when he wants to look his best he uses car mirrors for grooming, The Tehran Times reported.

And, when he needs a haircut, he simply burns his locks in a fire.

As for clothing, he wears rags and, in the winter, a war helmet to ward off the cold .

The last record of longest time going without showers belonged to a 66-year-old Indian man, Kailash Singh, who had not taken a bath over 38 years.

Mr Haji claims to have beaten that.
