There's nothing quite like cooling showers after scorching sunshine... which is handy, because a lot more of them are on the way.

The seemingly endless run of clear blue skies that left Britain basking in tropical sunshine is over, according to forecasters, to be replaced by a mixture of scattered rain and sunny spells.

While the mercury may not top this year’s high of 34.1C (93.4F) or match the baking conditions in mainland Europe, it will still be pleasant for millions choosing a staycation.

The recent heatwave weather has brought on an early crop of Brussel sprouts, which have arrived a month ahead of time, to farmers' delight

Much of Britain will see long sunny spells, with the warmest weather at up to 25C (77F) during the next few days in London and the South.

It will be cooler in the North, with temperatures hovering around 19C (66F).

But forecasters warn we should keep our umbrellas close at hand, as showers are also expected next week.

Laura Young, of the Met Office, said: ‘Throughout the week the temperatures are going to be around normal for this time of year, with some scattered showers.

‘There are going to be temperatures on the Continent that could reach 104F, but the way the winds are blowing at the moment none of that will reach us.

‘There is no sign of another heatwave, but we are expecting decent, sunny weather over the next ten days.

‘That is going to be mixed with more unsettled weather, but that is normal for August. It is traditionally the wettest summer month.’

The worst of the wet conditions will be in the West, while the best of the warmth will be in South.

Miss Young added: ‘We are going to see temperatures hovering in the early 20s in the South, and in London we might see them hit the mid 20s.

‘But don’t put away the brollies – enjoy the sunny weather when it comes. 

‘For the next couple of weeks at least, it looks like the hottest and driest weather is behind us.’ 

Heavier spells of rain are expected in the middle of the week, but more settled, drier conditions may return at the end of August.

It emerged yesterday that the hot weather this summer had some unexpected side-effects, having boosted the Brussels sprout crop and given an extra lease of life to Britain’s flying ant population.

After a poor 2012, Brussels sprout growers have experienced their earliest crop, which arrived a month earlier than usual.

Farmers are optimistic that this year’s yield could be up to a third larger than average.

And the sweltering weather also brought out unusually large numbers of flying ants.

Experts are astonished that the ants have been so active for so long.

Rebecca Nesbit, co-ordinator of the annual Flying Ant Survey, said: ‘There is a rush of activity at the same time every year.

‘Our findings from last year showed high numbers around August 8 for a few days. This year, the high numbers have been recorded from July 16.

'There are still very high numbers around the UK. It’s very rare to see such high numbers over such a long period.’
