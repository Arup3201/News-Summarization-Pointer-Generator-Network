Bad parents should be given government classes on how to cuddle their children, according to a major new report.

Politicians have been reluctant to ‘call out’ bad parenting, despite this having a bigger impact children than money or schooling, the former Labour minister Alan Milburn said.

Mr Milburn, who was brought in by David Cameron as the Government’s social mobility Tsar, attacked MPs for being ‘tentative and timid’ about bad parenting.

Parents need to be taught to cuddle their children to help cut the divide between rich and poor, according to a major new report

He called for a national parenting campaign, funded by cutting childcare tax breaks from families with at least one parent earning more than £100,000 a year.

Mr Milburn’s report also calls for the best teachers to be paid more to work in deprived areas, action to close the gap in GCSE results between rich and poor youngsters and for universities to admit 5,000 more students from disadvantaged backgrounds by 2020.

It also says that unpaid internships should be made illegal, and that the ‘living wage’ should be introduced by 2025.

The recommendations come amid warnings that the generation of workers will stay poorer than their parents throughout their lives unless 'urgent action' is taken to boost wages and slash youth unemployment.

Mr Milburn said the recession had condemned those in their twenties to 'the wrong side of the divide' between those with good jobs and their own homes and those stranded on low pay.

He revealed wages for the under 30s had fallen by 10 per cent since the recession pricing people out of buying their own home. Wages for those in their twenties are back to where they were in 1998 – 16 years ago.

Child poverty is now a bigger problem than during the 1960s, a damning report to be published this week has found.

The report was carried out by the National Children's Bureau and warns that Britain is at risk of becoming a place where 'children's lives are so polarised that rich and poor live in separate, parallel worlds.'

It blames a 'failure of political will' has resulted in poorer children having fewer chances in life today.

The report compares children's lives with data collected from a study called Born To Fail published in 1969.

It found that around 3.6million children are now living in relative poverty today compared with 2million in the late 1960s.

According to the report, a child from a disadvantage background is less likely to develop as quickly by the age of four than a child from a more affluent family.

Children living in deprived areas are also more likely to be the victim of an unintentional injury or accident at home and are nine times less likely to have green spaces to play.

While boys living in deprived areas are three times more likely to be obese than boys growing up in affluent areas compared with girls who are twice as likely to be obese.

Mr Milburn said the UK was at risk of becoming a ‘permanently divided’ nation, with the poorest in society left behind.

It says that the country is likely to see an unprecedented rise in child poverty over the next decade, amid the biting impact of welfare cuts and low pay.

The report argues that there is a risk that 2020 could be a watershed moment between an era in which everyone saw a rise in living standards to one that sees the poorest lose out.

It suggests that there is ‘little prospect’ of the immediate future promising more progress on social mobility - improving individuals' life chances - than the recent past.

The commission, led by Mr Milburn, says that it shares the view of experts who predict that 2020 will mark not the eradication of child poverty but the end of the first decade in recent history in which it increased.

‘A decade of rising absolute poverty is unprecedented since records began in the 1960s,’ the report says.

‘There is a clear risk that the year 2020 will mark not just a failure to meet the Government's legal obligation to have ended child poverty but could mark a permanent decoupling of earnings growth and economic growth at the bottom end of the labour market.

‘2020 could mark a watershed between an era in which for decades there have been rising living standards shared by all and a future era where rising living standards will bypass the poorest in society.’

It adds: ‘Social mobility, having flatlined in the latter part of the last century, would go into reverse in the first part of this century.

‘The United Kingdom would become a permanently divided nation.’

The new goal for education should be closing the gap between between disadvantaged children and their better-off classmates, the report argues.

On current trends, it is likely to be at least 30 years before the achievement gap at GCSE between these two groups is even halved, it warns.

‘The starting point should be parenting,’ Mr Milburn said.

‘Effective parenting has a bigger influence on a child's life than their wealth, their class or even their education. Most parents do a great job but some do not, and there has been a reluctance to call out bad parenting or to support more parents to develop their parenting skills.’

He said research found that four in 10 parents could be doing better, as he proposed the new national parenting programme, funded by cuts to childcare tax breaks.

Previous attempts to improve parenting have been too timid, the Commission argues, and calls for schools to identify poor parenting if it is affecting a children's achievement and development.

In schools, it must be a ‘national priority’ to improve the academic results of poorer children.

‘Just as previous governments have set targets to raise the bar in schools to increase standards, we look to the next government to set new targets to close the gap,’ Mr Milburn said.

‘It should aim to eradicate illiteracy and innumeracy amongst 11-year-olds by 2025, and it should aim to halve the attainment gap between 16-year-olds entitled to free school meals (FSM) and their peers, not within three decades but within one, so that by 2020, at least 50 per cent of children on FSM are achieving five good GCSEs, including English and maths.

‘That is what London schools actually manage to do today. It is what schools in every part of the country should be doing within the next five years.'

‘What will make these stretching targets achievable is the quality of teaching that children receive. More needs to be done to get the best teachers to teach in the most challenging schools.

‘Earlier this year, the Commission surveyed over 1,000 teachers and found that better pay would be a powerful incentive to do so. For decades, pay systems have rewarded teachers equally whether they teach in a wealthy, leafy suburb or a depressed coastal town.

‘Narrowing the attainment gap cannot happen unless we break from that old orthodoxy. On assuming office, the next government should immediately commission the STRB (School Teachers' Review Body) to create new pay grades for the best teachers to work in challenging schools in the hardest to recruit areas.

Despite recent falls in unemployment, the real value of people's stagnant wages are being eroded by inflation

The Government claims its 'long term economic plan' is starting to work - with more than half a millions people finding work last year

He also called for a new teachers' pay premium to offer 2,000 of the best teachers a 25 per cent pay uplift if they agree to work in a challenging school.

Outside of education, the report warns that the UK is now facing a ‘two-tier’ labour market, with five million workers, mainly women, earning less than the living wage, which currently stands at £7.65 an hour outside London and £8.80 in the capital. The current national minimum wage is £6.50.

‘We believe the next government should work with employers, trades unions and others to achieve a new ambition for the UK to become a living wage country by 2025 at the latest,’ the Commission says

Prime Minister David Cameron's official spokesman said child poverty is at its lowest for 30 years and there are now 290,000 fewer children growing up in workless households.

‘We would put it at the heart of how we address this the importance of work,’ said the spokesman. ‘It is through greater employment opportunities for the households in which children grow up that we can best address this issue.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said he shared Mr Milburn's ‘despair with the Conservatives’ over blocking the introduction of ‘meaningful’ new child poverty targets.

‘It dismayed me then and it dismays me now that the Conservatives have basically decided to turn their back on child poverty,’ he told his regular Westminster press conference.

Shadow trade minister Ian Murray said: ‘The last Labour government lifted over a million children out of poverty, helped thousands of families into work, built children's centres and introduced child and working tax credit to make work pay. But under David Cameron, child poverty is forecast to rise, not fall.’
