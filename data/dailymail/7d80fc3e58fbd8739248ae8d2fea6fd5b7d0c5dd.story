A Cambridge University finance officer stole nearly £300,000 from work to feed a multi-million-pound addiction to online fruit machines.

Jacqueline Balaam, 41, took the funds from Pembroke College to shore up a crippling gambling habit that saw her wager more than £6million over eight years.

She would sometimes win five-figure sums but rarely kept them – instead using the money to pay for more bets on internet site Jackpotjoy.

The married mother of two hung her head in shame and sobbed yesterday as she was jailed for 30 months after admitting a series of fraud charges.

Cambridge Crown Court heard how Balaam was gripped by a gambling addiction when she joined historic Pembroke College, whose alumni include 19th century prime minister William Pitt and poet Ted Hughes, in 2009.

Three years later she was abusing her trusted position as a purchase ledger clerk to duplicate invoices, paying the money into her own account.

Balaam, who was in charge of paying suppliers of goods and services, would then use her work’s accounting system to change details and cover her tracks.

Her crimes were uncovered when the college carried out an internal audit, revealing she had taken more than £285,000.

Police also found she had stolen £3,000 over four years from a village social club near Cambridge where she volunteered to act as treasurer.

During interviews she admitted she was hooked on Jackpotjoy after joining in 2006. The site, which describes itself as the UK’s biggest online bingo site, also offers gamblers the chance to play online fruit machines.

Prosecutor Sara Walker told the court: ‘She told police that she had a gambling addiction and that she played online on a laptop given to her by the social club.’

Balaam, said to have wagered a total of £6,383,126 using the stolen money and her own cash, took an overdose on the day she was arrested but recovered after hospital treatment.

She admitted a series of fraud charges in court yesterday, where she was supported by her partner.

Balaam told the court she had an addiction to online gambling website Jackpotjoy, and has made 'real efforts' to tackle her addiction since her arrest

Mark Shelley, defending, said his client had been led astray by her gambling habit. ‘She must have spent a lot of time on this addiction and she knew she was losing everything,’ he added.

‘There were no expensive holidays or cars or anything like that. It was all spent on gambling.’

Judge Gareth Hawkesworth told Balaam: ‘It is clear that your taking of this money was prompted by an addiction and it is equally clear that such was your addiction that you made no real profit from it and no money was spent for the benefit of your family.

‘I cannot suspend the sentence because of the sheer scale of what you did and the length of time which you proceeded with it. You are an intelligent woman and you were well able to seek help during that period and you did not do so.’

Balaam, who lives in a £250,000 terraced house in Cambridge, was sacked after her arrest.

Pembroke College, which was founded in 1347 and whose Master is former MI6 chief Sir Richard Dearlove, said it had now changed its accounting processes following the frauds by Balaam.
