A veteran plane spotter has captured a rare look at a phenomenon that exemplifies the beauty of modern-day air travel.

The aviation enthusiast’s 30-second video shows an Airbus A380 – the world’s largest passenger airliner – slicing through a wall of clouds and leaving a mesmerising display in its wake.

A prolific YouTube user named Schipholhotspot recorded the Dubai-bound Emirates aircraft as it soared into the clouds at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport.

With the rumbling from its Engine Alliance GP7200 engines serving as a soundtrack to the video, the superjumbo jet appears to melt into the clouds as it makes its ascent.

It leaves a gaping hole in the wall as clouds swirl in its turbulent wake and form a circle that looks like the eye of a storm.

Minutes later, after the double-decker plane is long gone, the wall splits in two as the clouds continue their beautiful spin.

Shot from the ground, the video has been a hit with aviation on enthusiasts on YouTube, where it has more than 60,000 views.

A user named YYC Flyer said: ‘Wow! I’ve never seen anything like that before. Stunning video.’

Another user, BL Planespotting, added: ‘That is something we don’t get to see often. Great capture.’

Emirates has nearly 60 Airbus A380s in its fleet, each with a capacity of 517 passengers on long-haul flights.
