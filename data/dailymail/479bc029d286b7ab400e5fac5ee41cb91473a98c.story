Fifty Shades author teamed up with erotic website Lovehoney to launch range in time for Christmas

Features products inspired by passages from book including silver pleasure balls, handcuffs and crops

She is the west London housewife who wrote the fastest-selling 
paperback of all time. She earns a reported $1 million a week from Kindle sales, is in talks to develop a classical album, and has been paid a reported £3m for film rights to her erotic novel.

And now Fifty Shades Of Grey author EL James is set to expand her erotic money-making machine yet further as she unveils a collection of Fifty Shades-branded sex toys inspired by her racy trilogy.

A range of official merchandise inspired by the books and developed in close association with the author - including the infamous silver
 pleasure balls, handcuffs and crops immortalised in the series - is set to go on sale in time to cash in on the Christmas market.

Everything the book fan will need: With names like 'Sweet Sting' and Submit To Me', the range includes handcuffs, riding crops and a bondage kit for first timers

Online sex toy shop Lovehoney say they worked in close partnership with James to make sure the range perfectly 
recreates the items used by Ana and her billionaire lover Christian Grey
 in the 'mummy porn' novels.

'This range is what I always imagined while I was writing Fifty Shades Of Grey,' said James.

'I’m so excited that the toys I described in the books have come to life and can now be enjoyed around the world.'

With names inspired by passages from 
the books, the official collection, unveiled today and set to be available in stores and online throughout Europe and Australia later this month, features individual items such as vibrators and love beads, or pre-packaged boxes filled with accessories.

Prices range from £10 for an individual piece to £40 for a more elaborate kit - and all come with suggestions for use and tips on introducing the items into a relationship - though one assumes if you've read the books, no such instructions will be necessary.

A 'Twitchy Palm' spanking paddle (£24.99) is just one of the accessories in the range inspired by Ana and Christian Grey's sex life, while there's little explanation necessary for the 'Please Sir' flogger at £16.99

The infamous silver pleasure balls will set you back £24.99, while a tease feather tickler is a more modest £10

Lovehoney co-founder Neal Slateford said: 'We’re thrilled to have worked with EL James to develop the Fifty Shades of Grey range.

'The trilogy has introduced generations of women to the joys of pleasure products. Now at last they can buy a range that truly reflects the world of Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele.'

'Mainstream retailers have traditionally 
been nervous about adding intimate accessories to their product ranges.

'Lovehoney’s Fifty Shades Of Grey range will give them 
the perfect opportunity to introduce their customers to the products 
they have enjoyed reading about.'
