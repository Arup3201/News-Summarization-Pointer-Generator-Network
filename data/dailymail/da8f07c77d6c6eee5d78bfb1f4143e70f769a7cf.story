Many of us hope that the many hours spent sorting through dusty old books and papers in the loft might bear some financial fruit one day.

But one family's dreams came true after finding the ‘Holy Grail’ of football cards in Charlotte, Michigan, worth up to an astonishing $15,000.

The rare card for Harvard University's John Dunlop, or ‘Anonymous’, was issued by the Mayo Tobacco Works, of Richmond, Virginia, in 1894.

Amazing set: The cards were found in an old farmhouse in a notebook full of vintage football and boxing cards - and the family almost threw them away

The cards were found in an old farmhouse in a notebook full of vintage football and boxing cards - and the family almost threw them away.

‘We get a lot of calls from a lot of people saying they've got something, and usually it's not what you expect,’ sports shop owner Lou Brown said.

Mr Brown, of Legends Sports and Games in Kentwood, Michigan, told Fox affiliate WXMI that the Dunlop card is the ‘rarest football card in existence’.

Collectors don’t know why Dunlop’s name was left off the 'Anonymous' card, which is part of the only 19th century card set dedicated to football.

Sporting heroes: One of the cards was of bareknuckle boxer John Sullivan, a world heavyweight champion known as the 'Boston Strong Boy', who died in 1918

The collection found by the family, remaining anonymous, also had 35 other cards from the same era, which were mostly boxers, reported WXMI.

One of the cards was of John Sullivan, a bareknuckle world heavyweight champion boxer known as the ‘Boston Strong Boy’, who died in 1918.

The cards, which were brought in on Monday, will either be put up for auction or Legends Sports and Games will put in a bid for them.

The top two grading companies for sporting cards have acknowledged just nine authentic copies of the Dunlop card in existence, reported WXMI.

Dunlop won four varsity letters at the university in Massachusetts and later became an assistant coach, according to an auction website.
