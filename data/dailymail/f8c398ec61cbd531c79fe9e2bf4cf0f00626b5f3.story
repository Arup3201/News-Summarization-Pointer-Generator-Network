New research from a rental bookings website has found that empowered holidaymakers are now demanding hundreds of millions in holiday property upgrades.

With masseurs, chefs and nannies now expected, the rise of 'selfish-catering' is a trend seen among those booking getaways this year.

While property upgrades to make them as chic as possible are the norm, some travellers are looking for extravagant extras such as a private library or private music concert.

Holiday rental booking portal, uGuest, finds a rise in the 'selfish-catering' trend among users

Potential renters now looking for many high-end upgrades in their holiday rental properties

Of the 3,000 respondents polled by uGuest, 60 per cent of UK holidaymakers are now more likely to consider staying in an independent property than they were five years ago.

When looking for the perfect rental, holiday bookers can spend up to 120 hours searching for the dream accommodation.

But these savvy and service-obsessed guests now expect everything from iPads to state of the art coffee machines to hot tubs to be included as standard.

They're willing to pay for these little luxuries though - as much as £530 per person - for their ideal holiday rental villa or apartment. 

Among the most requested extras are premium TV channels, use of iPad or tablet and sports equipment

1. Premium TV channels

2. Use of iPad or tablet computer

3. Sports equipment

4. Coffee machine

5. Home entertainment (eg. DVD players)

6. WiFi access

7. Games consoles and games

8. Use of bikes

9. Childcare facilities

10. Cleaning services 

And with the increasing demand for superior service, property owners are stepping up to the plate.

In fact, in 2015, hosts are expected to invest an average of £3,000 in their holiday properties over the year. 

Forty per cent of those surveyed also said that their properties were booked to capacity until January 2016.

Adventurer and travel writer Charley Boorman has seen this shift in behaviour emerging over the past two years.

'It's amazing to see what people want these days, and the lengths people will go to find the perfect property,' he said.

On the rise! 60% of those surveyed are more likely to rent a privately-owned property now than 5 years ago

With the increased demands, hosts are paying attention and spending thousands on little extras

Holidays to Spain and the Balearic Islands remains popular choices, but Japan, Poland and Russia are also expected to become hot property contenders for 2015.

Olivia Skeen, uGuest spokesperson, said: 'Property owners are now being forced to up the ante in offering quality accommodation - with all the extras - at competitive rates.

'Getting a holiday property fully kitted out, especially with the modern-day essentials such as superfast broadband, iPads, an HDTV and table tennis, can really pay off for property owners looking to increase their bookings.'
