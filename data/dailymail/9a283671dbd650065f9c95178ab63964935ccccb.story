Television critic Clive James has joked that he is trying to fend off the terminal cancer he is battling in order to impress Prime Minister Tony Abbott's daughters.

At 74 and facing an uncertain future, James said he had no plans of succumbing to the leukemia and emphysema he was diagnosed with in 2010 while speaking in front a crowd of 400 at the inaugural Australia and New Zealand Festival of Literature in London.

'As with every other red-blooded Australian male I'm doing it to impress Tony Abbott's daughters,' James said.

'That statement will get me into terrific trouble with the Australian media where I'm regarded as something of a right-winger.'

James also quipped that he plans to hold on until at least 2015 when the next series of Game Of Thrones is released to DVD.

Describing it as another 'farewell appearance,' the author, poet and television celebrity segued into the discussion about Game Of Thrones while reading from a poem, Not My Best Side.

Written by English poet U A Fanthorpe, the story delves into a princess’s conflicted, wry inner monologue as St George rescues her from the dragon.

He said the reading was breaking one of his lifelong rules to read the poem, James said. 'It’s vital to have nothing to do with any art form which has dragons in it,' he explained.

'I’ve lived by that rule all my life, successfully until quite recently when I was induced by members of my family to watch the first season of Game of Thrones.'

Having been hooked by the episodes in the two series since, he said he has every intention of making it to a fourth. 'One of my ambitions at this age and in this condition, when I’m short of breath and perhaps not long for this world… my ambition now is to live until box four of Game of Thrones. It’s good to have a target in life.'

He said his main reason for waiting until the DVD version was because he didn't quite have the  technological nous to work the knobs and buttons on his cable box.

James, who lives in Cambridge, moved to the English city as he has to stay near hospital for blood transfusions and other treatments for leukemia and emphysema, so he finds it hard even to come into London.

He has all but conceded that any realistic chance of air travel is now minimal, since flying is not recommended for someone with a condition as advanced as his. His stage of cancer also certainly means he will sadly never return to Australia.

He said: 'The truth is I can't (return). Australia is a long way. If you've got weak lungs it can't be recommended.'

As well as being a well-established television personality, James has also written literary criticism extensively for newspapers, magazines and periodicals in Britain, Australia and the United States.

He has forged a successful career as one of Australia's most celebrated expats, while working mostly in the UK. In 1992, he was made a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) which was upgraded to Officer level (AO) in the 2013 Australia Day Honours and was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2012 New Year Honours for services to literature and the media.
