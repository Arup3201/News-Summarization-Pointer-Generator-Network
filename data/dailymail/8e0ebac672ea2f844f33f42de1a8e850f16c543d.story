Ally McCoist has taken a cheeky swipe back at John Guidetti after the Celtic striker voiced confidence of sinking Rangers in a potential League Cup showdown.

Anticipation over a first Old Firm meeting since 2012 has been heightened after both clubs made it through to the semi-final draw, which will take place this evening.

Speaking after netting a hat-trick in a 6-0 rout of 10-man Partick Thistle on Wednesday night, Guidetti insisted he would relish facing Rangers and warned that Celtic’s last four opponents were ‘going down’.

That exuberant assessment by the Manchester City loanee drew a smiling response from McCoist.

‘With the greatest of respect to John, I remember getting excited about my first hat-trick - but against 11 men,’ said the Ibrox boss.

‘Listen, he’s entitled to his opinion and that’s the way it is.

‘But maybe, just maybe, he’s got caught up in the excitement of scoring his first hat-trick for Celtic - which, of course, we congratulate him on.’

Parkhead manager Ronny Deila has also stated that the ‘best teams are in the top division’, implying that he sees Aberdeen and Dundee United as greater semi-final dangers than Rangers.

‘In normal circumstances he would be right,’ said McCoist. ‘But in the last few years nothing has been what it seems in Scottish football. We’ve had anything but normal circumstances.

‘You have three of the five biggest clubs in the country playing in the Championship.

‘That would tell us it’s not normal circumstances. If it were normal then, yes, the three teams in the top-flight would be stronger than the team from the division below.

‘I understand Ronny but I don’t necessarily agree with him.’

McCoist admitted after Tuesday night’s win over St Johnstone that he would rather steer clear of Celtic but is adamant that does not mean he would fear a derby meeting.

‘I need to explain myself because there have been one or two things written and said,’ he continued.

‘I am certainly not running scared or hiding behind the couch.

‘I thought it was common sense what I was trying to say and I stand by that. As everyone can see from the bookies, Celtic are 4/5 favourites, everybody else is 9/2.

‘Because the bookies are very rarely wrong I thought it was common sense that you’d like a shot at one of the teams at 9/2 in terms of enhancing your chances of making the final.

‘There is no “I want to avoid Celtic at all costs”. That couldn’t be further from the truth.’

Rangers are set to be without Steve Simonsen and Fraser Aird for today’s Scottish Cup third-round tie at Dumbarton. Simonsen suffered a head injury in midweek, while Aird is sidelined by a strained abductor muscle.
