Stressed: Nurses should never have to care for more than eight patients at once, draft guidelines say

Nurses should never again have the 'dangerous' task of caring for more than eight hospital patients at a time, a major report will warn the NHS next week.

The guidelines - drawn up in the wake of the damning inquiry into deaths at Stafford Hospital - could mean thousands more nurses have to be hired to save patients suffering due to a lack of staff.

But despite warnings that they should be a bare minimum, the new measures would still be flexible depending on the needs of each hospital.

And one nursing campaign says a one-to-eight ratio is not enough, with one-to-four the ideal target.

The draft measures were drawn up at the government's request by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

The one-to-eight ratio refers to both day and night shifts but the guidelines will focus most urgently on overnight care in acute adult hospital wards, a NICE spokesman said.

These are the shifts where some of the most shocking under-staffing has been revealed.

Figures obtained by the Royal College of Nursing in November showed some stressed nurses had cared for up to 22 patients each on night shifts at Hemel Hempstead and Watford General, both part of West Hertfordshire NHS trust.

At Hinchingbrooke hospital in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, meanwhile, there was one nurse for 21 patients and there was one for 16 patients at Colchester Hospital, in Essex.

The draft report is due to be released on Monday, 194 years to the day after the birth of Florence Nightingale.

A NICE spokesman said: 'It recognises that if
 each registered nurse is caring for more than eight patients regularly during the day, there is an increased risk of harm.'

Lead nurses on wards will be told to watch out for 'red flag events', which include patients not being given medicine, asked about their pain or helped to the bathroom - and a single one should indicate the ward needs more staff.

That system would be used instead of the 
government ordering compulsory numbers or targets, which NICE warned 
could become a maximum rather than a minimum on which to improve.

Protest: But some union members say a one-to-eight ratio is still not safe enough (pictures posed by models)

Professor Gillian Leng, NICE's deputy 
chief executive, described the measures as 'an important step forward' but added: 'There is no floor or ceiling number on the 
required number of nursing staff that can be applied across the whole of
 the NHS.

'Assessing patient needs [is] paramount when making decisions about the number of nursing staff, 
and planning should allow for flexibility on a day-to-day or 
shift-by-shift basis.'

Yet Susan Osborne, chairman of the Safe Staffing Alliance which includes union members and the Royal College of Nursing, said last month one-to-eight was an absolute minimum and a 'red card'.

Another campaign called Four to One has been launched by Unison members after nurses told of 'horror stories' of wards with 12 or 14 patients per nurse.

'We need to reinforce the message that one nurse caring for more than eight patients is not only unsatisfactory, it is dangerous,' Ms Osborne wrote in the industry magazine Nursing Standard.

'It could mean the difference between life and death... A one to eight ratio buys just seven and a half minutes of a registered nurseâ€™s time per patient per hour.

'What can you do in seven and a half minutes? Make a cup of tea, strip and make two beds, do cardiopulmonary resuscitation knowing three minutes without oxygen could leave a patient dead or brain dead?'

The move comes after an inquest heard a
 retired policeman had to tell nurses his mother had died after 
finding her 'propped up' and 'cold' during a hospital visit.

Joan
 James, 85, from Solihull, Birmingham, was found dead by Martyn James, 
54, on January 22 last year, 30 minutes after she had last been checked 
by a nurse.

Nurses at 
Heartlands in Birmingham had no idea Mrs James had died until her son - 
who had unknowingly been downstairs getting a coffee - raised the alarm,
 the widow's inquest was told.

A Department of Health spokesman told MailOnline today: 'At the moment it's for local NHS bodies to decide staffing levels but in light of the Francis report, the Department has been very involved.

'Staffing levels are something that we want to be looked at in more detail and that's why we commissioned NICE to produce this draft guidance.

'There are over 5,100 more nurses on our 
wards since 2010... We 
have increased the NHS budget in real terms and are clear that hospitals
 must balance their books whilst ensuring compassionate, quality care 
for all.

'We know this can and is being done.'

A new website, which was originally due to be launched last month, is now due to go live next month with an unprecendented level of detail on how well individual hospital wards are staffed.

A public consultation on the staffing plans, meanwhile, is running until June 10 and the guidelines are due to be finalised this summer.

Report was commissioned by NHS due to fears about under-staffing

But campaigners warn even a 1:8 ratio is not generous enough

It is 'enough time to make a cup of tea, two beds and do some resuscitation'

And the guideline is likely to be flexible, not laid down fully by Whitehall
