A nose for a rose: Roses proved more popular than exotic plants and remain Britons' favourite bloom

Roses are the nation's favourite garden flower, according to a new poll. 

Thirty per cent of Britons said the rose was their top growing plant, followed by fuschias (23 per cent) and lavender (20 per cent).

Geraniums (19 per cent) and tomato plants (eight per cent) made up the top five, the poll of 3,600 gardeners carried out by Dobbies Garden Centres found.

James Barnes, chief executive at Dobbies, said the firm first noted an increase in demand for the traditional rose in 2013 - and 100 years later it's still going strong.

He said: 'As the Chelsea Flower Show marks 100 years, we wanted to discover what people choose to grow in their garden. 

'It's refreshing that the results came up smelling of roses following their blossoming rise in popularity since 1913. 

'They've remained in our top 5 selling products for the past few years and every spring our customers visit us for advice and top tips on the season's rose trends.'

Some roses carry more bloom than any bush rose. Others flower reliably throughout the summer and autumn.

Clematis, honeysuckle and jasmine will twine harmoniously with them, extending colour and fragrance.

Ramblers flower once and tend to grow larger and sprawl.

Most respond well to harsh pruning but vigorous varieties also thrive untouched, to swarm up into trees or engulf small buildings.

Good ramblers for walls include the salmon Albertine and curiously mauve-flowered Veilchenblau

June is the perfect time to select roses but winter is better for planting.
