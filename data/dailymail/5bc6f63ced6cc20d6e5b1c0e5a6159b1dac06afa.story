They came expecting to see something run-of-the-mill but left, bewildered, having witnessed something out of the ordinary.

Anfield is no stranger to hosting dramatic occasions but, even measured against some of those riotous evenings of the past, this was remarkable. In years to come, they will recall Liverpool against Middlesbrough and the night of 30 penalties.

Yes, you read that correctly. Liverpool find themselves in the Capital One Cup’s fourth round after beating Middlesbrough 14-13 in a shootout after the previous 120 minutes had saw the two teams locked together at 2-2.

Those bare statistics, though, do not do justice to how this contest ebbed and flowed and the stories it produced, from 17-year-old Jordan Rossiter marking his Liverpool debut with a goal from 35 yards to Middlesbrough’s Patrick Bamford, holding his nerve in added time of extra time.

All 22 players on the pitch at the final whistle took a kick in the shootout (goalkeepers included), with some stepping up twice. Heartbreakingly for Middlesbrough, who ran themselves to a stanstill, Albert Adomah became the fall guy, firing wide into The Kop after Suso gave Liverpool match point.

'It was a real good night for us,’ said Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers. ‘I was pleased to get through in that experience. It was great for our young players. It’s good to win, no matter how you win. They were real good quality penalties and I’m pleased to get into the next round.’

He will also be relieved. While supporters will have gone home struggling to comprehend the events that had unfolded in front of them, Rodgers will have left Anfield wondering when his side are going to stop giving away cheap goals.

A better team than Middlesbrough might have eviscerated Liverpool here and, really, Aitor Karanka’s team had sufficient chances to make the eight-time winners of this competition pay the ultimate price: Adam Clayton almost knocked them out in the 85th minute when he hit the post.

By that time, Middlesbrough – who arrived here buoyant on the back of a three-game winning spree – had pegged Liverpool back, Adam Reach bulleting in a header from a wonderful free-kick by Grant Leadbitter in the 62nd minute after Mamadou Sakho had handled.

‘I never thought the tie was going away from us,’ Rodgers argued. ‘But we are making too many mistakes at the moment. The first goal we are disappointed with and even more so the second goal. We gave the ball away sloppy, when we were in total control of the game was in control.

‘We made it hard for ourselves. But we showed resilience and it is job done. I don’t need to jump up and down to celebrate. We have not had a great start to the season but this is a great night for us and (winning) is another step forward.’

Middlesbrough made the brighter start but in the ninth minute came the moment that will live with Rossiter for life. When Lucas lofted a ball forward, Rickie Lambert – captain for the night on what was his first Liverpool start – saw shot was blocked by the advancing Jamal Blackman.

But the danger had not been cleared and Rossiter, showing remarkable poise for one so young, firmly and accurately returned his drive from 35 yards, the ball skidding past Blackman, who made a ungainly attempt to salvage the situation on what was also his debut, into the unguarded net. 

For a moment, Rossiter – standing out from the crowd by wearing a simple pair of black boots – could not quite believe what had happened but then he took off, jumping with delight and racing over to celebrate by Rodgers, who was clapping his hands together in joyous approval.

There has long been talk that Rossiter has the potential to become a fixture in Liverpool’s first team in the future – Robbie Fowler felt compelled to compare him on Twitter to Steven Gerrard in January 2013 – and, perhaps, in years to come this clip will be shown over and over again.

One thing for certain is that highlights of this contest will receive plenty of airings. Middlesbrough deserved their shot at extra-time but Liverpool found a rhythm that had been missing before and looked to have finally seen of their opponents in the 109th minute when Suso fired in.

Much to Rodgers bewilderment, however, there was to be another twist when Raheem Sterling gave the ball away to Daniel Ayala, who sent Bamford clear. He was crudely brought down by Kolo Toure and kept his nerve to set up the shootout.

‘I have no words to say properly how I feel,’ said Karanka. ‘I have to say that my players, the crowd, everything was brilliant. The only thing that wasn’t was the last penalty.’

Karanka could leave with his head held high. His team, after all, did all they could and more to cause the shock of the round. As it was, another chapter gets added to the list of extraordinary Anfield nights.
