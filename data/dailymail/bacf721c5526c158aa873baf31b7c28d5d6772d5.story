Australian transgender supermodel Andreja Pejic has walked the catwalk for the first time in her hometown as a woman.

The 23-year-old walked the runway for Josh Goot at the The Grand Showcase at Virgin Australia Melbourne Fashion Festival on Thursday night alongside Montana Cox and Samantha Harris.

‘I think I was 16, so it’s pretty cool to come back and do it all again,' the model, who went by Andrej until her gender reassignment surgery last year, said of her return to the Melbourne modelling scene.

The Serbian-born, Australian-raised beauty made her catwalk debut as a woman at London Fashion Week last month.

'I always get a little bit nervous when I walk - it's not my favourite thing, she told AAP at the Tiffany & Co. National Designer Award presentation on Monday.

'I actually prefer shooting because I'm a little bit more of an introvert.'

During her visit Down Under, Andreja also made an appearance on Network Ten's The Project, where she discussed filming a documentary chronicling her surgery in the US in 2014.

'It was very important to me to share the story and humanise the situation and the experience,’ she said.

'I do think I’m a public person anyway, most of it [the story] is already out,' she added of her decision to put her life in front of the lens.

‘There are still transgender youth committing suicide everywhere around the world because of ignorance…so I think there’s definitely a long way to go.’

Flower power: Bold floral prints were a focal point of the presentation on Thursday night

Pejic was the star attraction at the Josh Goot showcase, which celebrated the label's 10th anniversary.

It was a triumphant moment for the embattled designer, who regained control of his company earlier this month after it was forced into voluntary administration.

'The support I have received from investors, creditors, customers, staff and fashion industry peers has been overwhelming' the Sydney designer said in a statement last month.

'People have been extremely generous with their good wishes, knowledge and advice.'

Goot said as a result of the process he would be 'making significant changes to the company’s structure, processes, supply chain and internal timelines, 

The presentation featured bold floral prints on dresses and bomber jackets, and stark monochrome form-fitting dresses and two-piece ensembles.
