Do you use Twitter as a way of promoting yourself, or a place to have conversations with others? Depending on your answer you could be considered a ‘giver’ or a ‘taker.’

A fundraising site has created a tongue-in-cheek tool to analyse how selfish tweeters are by comparing the number of retweets they make, and the number of people they mutually follow.

This analysis then decides which group they sit in, and gives them a score out of 100.

At the time of writing, there were 23,459 givers and 11,207 takers with Piers Morgan topping the list for being a 100 per cent ‘taker’.

Other celebrities that take more than they give on Twitter include Kim Kardashian and Professor Green.

At the opposite end of the scale, however, are Russell Brand, who sits at around 45 per cent and Louie Spence at almost 50 per cent.

As well as awarding a score, the tool also provides statistics based on the ratio of people the user follows, compared to the number who follow them.

As well as awarding a score, the tool provides statistics based on the ratio of people the user follows, compared to the number who follow them. It also looks at the percentage of people who the user follows back, and the number of retweets

It looks at the percentage of people who the user follows back, as well as the number of retweets analysed.

To use the tool, created by Give As You Live, Twitter users will need to give the application access to a sample of tweets.

‘The truth is out! From Kim Kardashian to Simon Cowell, the scores are in and the judgements have been passed.’ said Steff Lewis, head of communications at Give as you Live.

‘With no ifs, buts or maybes allowed, it’s time to face up to the truth; all the ‘givers’ can pat themselves on the back and as for the ‘takers’, well, it’s never too late to change. ‘
