In a turbulent 24 hours, the Northern Territory is right back where it started, after it appeared to lose a chief minister, gain a new one, and then eventually reinstated the first one.

And despite expressing a desire to avoid the fate of the LNP in Queensland, the damage wrought may well consign the Country Liberals to a one-term government when the public go to the polls in August next year.

At 1am on Tuesday, Minister for Primary Industry and Mines Willem Westra van Holthe called a hasty news conference to announce that he had been voted chief minister by his parliamentary wing colleagues.

Mr Westra van Holthe said Mr Giles had '110 per cent' of his support, and that he was very pleased to be deputy

The trigger was discontent with the direction the government was taking, he said, promising to be more consultative and transparent.

But just 18 hours later he stood calmly beside the man he'd tried to topple and pledged him his full support, dismissing the incident as "nothing more than a fairly large blip on the radar".

'I am 100 per cent, in fact 110 per cent behind the chief minister,' Mr Westra van Holthe told reporters.

Earlier in the day Chief Minister Adam Giles refused to resign just minutes before Mr Westra van Holthe's planned swearing-in ceremony at 11am, grinding the leadership change to a halt.

As it turned out, the challengers only had the support of nine of the 25 members of the Legislative Assembly, but needed 13 to agree to install a new chief minister.

On Tuesday afternoon Mr Giles whittled away their numbers, calling his colleagues' bluff, and pointing out that they couldn't expect to govern if they couldn't mount a proper coup.

Mr Giles accepted that mistakes he'd made as leader contributed to the uproar, but was vague on how he would work to his colleagues' satisfaction in future.

'I think you need to be a bit more inclusive in how you do things ... making sure it's not just cabinet deciding things, but also the wider parliamentary wing,' he said.

Mr Giles stepped away from suggestions he made earlier in the day that he would consider resigning and calling for an early election, and denied he had threatened his colleagues with a snap poll to retain power.

'I was thinking about an early election to tidy a few things up, but we've resolved our differences ... Willem has been a bloody good minister the whole time in government.'

This was a marked difference from his critique of Mr Westra van Holthe earlier in the day, when he said he could have better handled outbreaks of banana freckle and a melon virus.

'Quite frankly, I don't believe that Willem Westra Van Holthe has the capacity, capability or the tenacity or the professionalism to be chief minister,' he said.

Meanwhile Mr Westra van Holthe said Mr Giles had '110 per cent' of his support, and that he was very pleased to be deputy.

It's his second time in the job, after a six-day stint in 2013 the week before Mr Giles mounted his own successful coup against then-leader Terry Mills, who was in Japan on trade talks.

He said he could absolutely rule out staging another coup to get the chief minister's attention in future.

Mr Giles said Attorney-General John Elferink, whom Mr Westra van Holthe had named as his deputy, would keep his job, but did not rule out other sackings.

The reshuffled cabinet is expected to be sworn in at a later date.
