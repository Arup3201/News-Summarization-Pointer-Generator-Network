A helicopter rescue worker arrested on suspicion of stealing Michael Schumacher's medical notes has been found hanged in his police cell, prosecutors said.

The suspect was found dead today around 24 hours after he was held by officers investigating the theft and leaking of the confidential file.

The man, who has not been identified, worked for Swiss helicopter rescue firm Rega, which organised the Formula One champion's transport from a French hospital to a unit in Switzerland in June, the Zurich prosecutor's office said in a statement.

A helicopter rescue worker has hanged himself in his cell a day after being arrested on suspicion of stealing a medical file on Michael Schumacher (above) who was in a coma for six months after a skiing accident

Schumacher, 45, suffered a major head 
injury when he fell while skiing in France in December and was kept in a
 medically induced coma for six months after the accident.

He was recently transferred from the hospital in Grenoble, France, to a unit near his Swiss home, allowing his wife Corinna to attend a public event at her ranch in Givrins.

The records are believed to consist of several pages of medical notes outlining the extent of the injury suffered by Schumacher.

Earlier this year, his manager Sabine Kehm revealed the documents had been 'clearly stolen' and warning that anyone buying or publishing the 'confidential files' would be prosecuted.

It is understood the notes were offered for sale across Europe to media organisations for £50,000.

Last month, a Swiss newspaper claimed Schumacher was making such good progress in the Lausanne rehab clinic he may be home before the end of the summer.

Schumacher woke up from his medically induced coma last month after smashing his head on rocks while skiing on December 29 in the French Alps.

It is understood that he remains paralysed and communicates with his wife and children Gina-Maria, 17, and son Mick, 15, by fluttering his eyes.

Doctors at the Lausanne clinic hope to have Michael sitting upright in an advanced electronic wheelchair that he can control via his mouth within a few weeks.
