Eleanor Sharpston, the Court of Justice's Advocat General, stated that she agreed with the ruling that France's tax on Britons selling their holiday homes is 'illegal'

The European Union appears set to rule that France's tax on Britons selling their holiday homes is 'illegal'. 

The decision could force the French government to pay back more than £396million to EU residents who sold or rented their second homes in the country in the last three years.

In 2012, roughly 200,000 Britons saw the capital gains tax on the sale of their second homes rise from 19 per cent to 34.5 per cent. The tax on rental income increased from 20 per cent to 34.5 per cent.

This was as a result of a 15.5 per cent 'social charge' that Francois Hollande's government imposed in a bid to raise some £200million a year.

But there is a case that has been brought before the Court of Justice of the European Union whose decision might put an end to these 'social charges' on Britons' holiday homes.

It is based on European regulation that states an individual should only be subject to the social security legislation of one member state.

The court has previously said that an individual should only pay social contributions levied on their income in one country. Now it must decide whether the same rules apply to social contributions imposed on assets, such as second homes.

The European Commission has already ruled that it considers extending these French 'social charges'  to non-residents to be against EU law.

And, in an opinion released last month, Eleanor Sharpston, the Court of Justice's Advocat General, stated that she agreed with the ruling. 

Now a number of legal experts have stated that they think it likely the Court will follow Ms Sharpston's opinion.

David Anderson, a British-based cross-border tax adviser, stated in an online post: 'It seems very likely the European Court when it makes its final decision shortly (before end 2014) will take this view as the Advocate General is very clear in her opinion.'

If this conclusion is reached, then Britons who have paid the additional 'social charge' on a sale of a French property should be able to reclaim past payments. The same principle should apply to charges paid on rental income.

But a French law passed in 2013 means that taxpayers only one year - starting from the end of the year that the social charge was paid - to claim the money. 

As a result, the period to reclaim on any social contribution paid on a property sold in 2013 expires on 31 December this year. Britons who rented out properties in 2012 will have until the end of the year to make a claim.

However, British based law firm Wragge, Lawrence Graham & Co stressed that the rules are not entirely clear and said their might be room for the law to be interpreted more favourably.
