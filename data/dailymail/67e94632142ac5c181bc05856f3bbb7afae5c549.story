A teacher helped her son fraudulently claim £11,000 in benefits while he was travelling around Asia by sending him forms to complete so he could pretend he was looking for work.

Tom Clancy even managed to marry a Thai bride while he was on his 18 month trip. 

His mother, Sibyl Lloyd, of Carmarthenshire, sent her 36-year-old son forms so he could sign them as he took in the sights in Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia.

This meant he was able to claim £11,268 in housing benefit, council tax, disability allowance and income support while he away, pretending to authorities he was looking for work. 

A disciplinary hearing for Lloyd, a teacher, heard that she then transferred the money abroad to her son so he could use it on his travels. 

Clancy, of Loughor, Swansea, admitted failing to inform the authorities of a change in circumstance while he was out of the country.  He was given a community order after he returned to Britain.

Lloyd, 56, admitted aiding and abetting his fraud. 

The mother-of-three also received an official reprimand from the General Teaching Council for Wales after admitting her convictions had an impact on her fitness to teach.

She had been working at a school in Gorseinon at the time of the offences and had been teaching for 23 years. 

The General Teaching Council for Wales found that the fraud had affected Lloyd's fitness to teach

Presenting officer Huw Roberts said: 'Teachers are role models to pupils and the public needs to have confidence in the teaching profession.'

The hearing in Caridff was told she re-paid 'every penny that was over claimed.'

Sheila Drayton, chair of the panel, said: 'Teachers are expected to adhere to the law. 

'Ms Lloyd did not adhere to lawful standards of behaviour and did not conduct herself in a manner so as to uphold public trust and confidence in the teaching profession.

'She has expressed genuine regret and remorse and repaid the money in full.

'The offences took place outside school and there is no evidence that her behaviour has adversely affected pupils.'
