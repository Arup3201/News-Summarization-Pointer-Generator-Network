A group of male Michigan Republicans decided to answer critics of a controversial law requiring women to buy abortion insurance in case of a rape with an image of themselves holding women's fashion magazines.Â 

In what progressive groups are calling a poor attempt at humor, state House Republicans Peter Pettalia, Roger Victory, and Ben Glardon posed in the image posted to Twitter.

In the picture, the men pose with copies of Glamour and Harper's Bazaar to prove they care about women's concerns.

The tweet was posted with the line: 'Don't say we don't understand women.'

The response from critics who claim the group has waged a war on women was swift.

'Eat your heart out ladies,' read one sarcastic response from Mother Jones.

The controversial law first made headlines during the 2010 fight over health care reform.

An amendment from Democrat Rep. Bart Stupak would have blocked Obamacare abortion coverage in favor of requiring people to purchase separate, abortion-only policies.

A similar bill was enacted this March by Republican lawmakers.

23 other states have adopted similar policies.

Feminist blog Jezebel called the law an 'atrocious' piece of legislation 'which essentially calls on women to plan ahead for their rapes.'

The site also noted that Right to life Michigan essentially admitted the law would likely not lower the state's abortion rates though it would force extra financial strain on women.
