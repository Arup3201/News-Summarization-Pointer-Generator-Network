Police in Florida have dramatic released bodycam footage of a deadly raid where an unarmed fugitive was shot and killed at his home.

U.S. Marshalls and sheriff's deputies are seen surrounding the home of Corey Tanner in Flager County in August 2014 while four children are inside. 

The 24-year-old serial criminal, whose family say had mental health problems and was on medication, was wanted for attempted murder.

Raid: U.S. Marshalls and sheriff's deputies are seen surrounding the home of Corey Tanner in Flager County, Florida, serving a warrant for attempted murder 

Ready: Officers are heard shouting at the 24-year-old serial criminal to surrender and walk out 

Officers are then heard repeatedly telling Tanner to leave the home with his hands up while getting into position, but the demands are ignored. 

The four youngsters said to be in the house at the time are then allowed out, leaving Tanner in the bedroom. 

The sheriff's department then drives a patrol round with his brother, John, in the back seat in a bid to talk Tanner out of the house without harm. 

He says his brother is not armed and pleads for them to bring his mother in to persuade him to give up. 

Minutes into the stand-off, the video, obtained by Local 6, skips when the fatal shots are fired and officers are seen going around to the side of the house.

Another man who was believed to be in the house at the time is seen being frisked on the lawn by the side of the property before he is released.  

Run: The officer whose bodycam was recording the video is at one point seen running around the house with his gun held up

Fugitive: Tanner had a warrant for his arrest outstanding at the time, but his family insist he was on medication and suffering from mental health problems at the time 

Speaking after his death in August, Tanner's family members said he had mental health problems and was on medication but didn't deserve to die. 

'They didn't give him a chance,' said Tanner's mother, Brenda Williams. 'He had problems because he was bi-polar and had other mental problems, but almost everybody knew that.'

The U.S. Marshal's Service issued a statement saying Tanner was alone when the shooting occurred, but Tanner's aunt told News4Jax that children were inside the home.

'They feel they were doing their job, and we feel they couldn't have done it a better way,' Gloria Harris said.

The state's attorney has since ruled that the shooting was justified. Tanner had an extensive criminal record including aggravated burglary.

Pleas: The officer then moves around to the front of the house to a patrol car where Tanner's brother John is sitting. He is heard saying over and over his brother is unarmed 

Deadly moment: The video then skips when the shots are fired, as officers are seen moving around the side of the house 

Aftermath: On the other side of the property, a man who was believed to be in the house at the time is released after being frisked by officers
