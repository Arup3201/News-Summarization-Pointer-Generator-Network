The incident unfolded Wednesday morning in the 4000 block of King Cole Boulevard in Orlando.

When responding officers questioned Edward Holley, he said that when he spotted Darryl Blacknell standing on his porch, he grabbed a pan of grits that have been bubbling on the stovetop, went outside and threw his breakfast at his unsuspecting neighbor, sending him running in pain.

Holley explained that he and Blacknell had gotten into an argument the night before, which continued the following morning and turned physical.

The 29-year-old told investigators that he was playing poker with Holley's cousin and another friend on the porch when the 60-year-old man came up to him and the two got into a shoving match.

With the words, 'I have something for you,' Blacknell said Holley retreated into his house and returned moments later with a steaming pan of grits, which he hurled at the younger man.

Holley's cousin, who was standing next to Blacknell, also got splashed with the Southern breakfast staple and suffered burns to his arm.

Holley was ordered held without bond. On his way to the police station, the man told officers that the incident was Blacknell's fault because the man was 'following' him around.
