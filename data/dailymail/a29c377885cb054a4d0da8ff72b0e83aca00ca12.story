Jailed: Lottery winner Gavin Davies from Neath, South Wales, has been sentenced to 16 months in prison for attacking his girlfriend

A lottery winner who was today jailed for beating up his girlfriend in one of his luxury cars blamed the attack on the 'strain' of becoming an overnight millionaire.

Former professional cage-fighter Gavin Davies, 30, tried to strangle Daniah Hussain, 22, with a car seatbelt because of a row over a shopping trip just three months after winning a £1million jackpot.

A court was told Davies blamed the 'sustained assault' on the stress of winning the lottery, moving into a new house and becoming a father.

Motoring fan Davies bought three luxury cars since his win - including a Lamborghini LP560-4.

Swansea Crown Court heard how Davies 
and Miss Hussain were travelling in his 'everyday' car - an Audi - to go
on a luxury shopping trip to spend some of their winnings with 
four-month-old baby son Jayden.

But
the pair started arguing when Davies tried to back out of the family 
shopping day because he had meetings with financial advisors to discuss 
how to invest his fortune.

Swansea
Crown Court heard Davies pulled over and tried to strangle Miss Hussain
with the Audi’s seatbelt, telling her: 'If you don’t shut up, I will 
shut you up.'

Prosecutor
James Jenkins said: 'They were bickering and arguing from the outset of
their journey. Davies pulled into a layby and told her to get out. But she refused because the baby was in the back.

'Davies loosened the seatbelt around her neck and started to strangle her with it. She froze in fear.'

The court heard Davies stopped his assault and the couple then carried on with their journey to a retail park - with Miss Hussain wrapping a blue baby blanket around her neck to hide the marks.

Mr Jenkins said: 'Davies told her she could have anything she wanted.'

But during the journey Davies attacked Miss Hussain again - 'repeatedly striking' her as she sat in the passenger seat.

Mr Jenkins said: 'He punched her repeatedly, held her head with his hands and brought it down onto the steering wheel.

'He was striking her while he was driving and put his teeth around her nose.

'Miss Hussain said he was so angry his face was red and beads of sweat ran down his forehead.'

Happier times: Speaking after his win in January, Davies said he planned to spend his 'money wisely'

The court heard Davies drove past a police station at Neath, near Swansea, where Miss Hussain shouted for help.

Davies was arrested later at his mother’s home after his girlfriend dialled 999 to report the attack.

Mr Jenkins said she needed to have general anaesthetic for surgery to realign her nose.

Davies blamed Miss Hussain’s 'hormones' and post natal depression for the row in April this year.

He told police that he was trying to restrain her because her behaviour was endangering other road users.

Frank
Phillips, defending, said: 'He blames his behaviour on the strain of 
becoming a new father, winning the lottery and moving house.

'They were very unpleasant injuries but not of a serious nature.'

Davies accepted he had repeatedly punched his girlfriend - but denied it was as many as 50 times nor that he had spat.

Davies admitted causing actual bodily harm in April in the car assault.

He also admitted a charge common assault in December - before the lotto win - when he 'repeatedly pushed her face into a settee'.

He was jailed for 16 months.

Miss Hussain has left the couple’s new home and is living at a secret address in the area.

Swansea Crown Court heard Davies had previous convictions for motoring offences.

Davies was revealed as the £1 million National Lottery raffle winner at a press conference in a plush Swansea hotel in January.

He was pictured alongside a Lamborghini provide for the day by lottery operator Camelot. But he was soon seen driving around his hometown in his own Lamborghini and his new Audi.

At the time of the win, Davies said: 'I want to look after my son and look after my family. I’m going to use the money wisely and invest.

'I won’t waste a penny. Time will tell, but hopefully, you will see me one day with £10 million.

'The Lamborghini is my fun out of the way. The rest of the money is to look after my family.'

As well as being jailed for 16 months Davies, of Ammanford, near Swansea, was placed under a indefinite restraining order to keep away from Miss Hussain and her family.

Judge Mr Justice Spencer, who described the incident as a 'sustained assault', told him: 'It was a nasty and prolonged assault on your vulnerable partner in front of your baby son.

'You were subject to unusual stress having just won the lottery and becoming a new father.

'But you were seeking to exercise control over her both physically and emotionally.'
