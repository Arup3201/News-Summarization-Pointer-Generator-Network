Nicolas Sarkozy intervened in divorce proceedings on behalf of the Aga Khan four years after granting the multi-billionaire British knight exemption from all French taxes, it emerged today.

The former French president, who is a lawyer, took on the case last Autumn a year after a court ordered the religious leader to pay his estranged German wife, Begum Inaara Aga Khan, around £54million.

Mr Sarkozy was 'pulling the strings in the background' with the aim of obtaining a settlement, according to sources close to the case.

Lawyers for both sides have declined to confirm or deny the claims, but legal e-mails seen by The Times are said to refer to his direct role from October to December.

In the end, however, no agreement was reached.

Details of Mr Sarkozy's involvement emerged as the Prince's office confirmed the highest French court has now quashed the £54million divorce settlement from 2011.

The original appeal decision, made by a court in Amiens, had attributed all responsibility for the marriage breakdown to the Aga Khan, 76, after ruling that his affair with an airline stewardess was to blame.

But that settlement has now been thrown out by the Paris Cour de Cassation after the twice-married billionaire should not bear all responsibility for the split from the 49-year-old Begum, also known as Gabriele Thyssen.

The couple, who have a 13-year-old son, Aly, are now expected to face a retrial in around a year's time in what has already been an eight-year legal battle fought in Switzerland, Britain and now France.

A spokesman for Mr Sarkozy declined to comment on his possible role in the divorce, while the Aga Khan's lawyer was not available for comment yesterday.

The Aga Khan's spokesman made no comment other than to confirm to The Times that the Paris Court had 'struck down all provisions of the Amiens court of appeal'.

Lawyers for the Begum only confirmed that the divorce ruling had been quashed.

The Aga Khan divorced his first wife, 
Sally Croker-Poole, a former English model, in 1995 – paying £20 million
 to the mother of three of his children.

His second wife, born Gabriele Thyssen
 in Frankfurt, was previously married to German royal Prince Earl-Emich 
zu Leiningen. They divorced in 1997.

Last autumn, it emerged that the Aga Khan has been 'exonerated' from paying any tax at all by Mr Sarkozy.

Controversy: Mr Sarkozy intervened in the divorce deal at around the same time as it emerged he was facing corruption allegations including that he illegally accepted cash from Liliane Bettencourt (pictured), France's richest woman, to pay for his election campaign in 2007

It meant the tycoon, a Muslim prince who was given the title 'His Highness' by the Queen in 1957 and made a Knight Commander in 2004, could protect his vast fortune across the Channel.

This was despite being worth as much as £6billion and owning mansions, yachts, private jets, some 800 race horses and even a private island in the Bahamas.

Details of the arrangement came as it was revealed Mr Sarkozy faced a string of corruption enquiries.

Allegations against the 57-year-old include claims that he illegally accepted cash from Liliane Bettencourt, France's richest woman, to pay for his election campaign in 2007, allegedly in return for future tax breaks for the L'Oreal heiress.

According to a letter leaked to the Paris investigative website Mediapart, Mr Sarkozy used 'exceptional powers' to assist the Aga Khan, who was born in Switzerland but who has maintained strong links with Britain all his life.

The letter, dated April 4, 2008, pledged that the Aga Khan would be let off all 'direct taxes, stamp duty, and wealth tax' - saving him billions.

Mr Sarkozy gave the Aga Khan an obscure diplomatic 'courtesy' fiscal status usually reserved for heads of state.

The then president, who lost the election to Francois Hollande in May, said a tax bill of zero was justified because the Aga Khan, who claims to be a direct descendant of the prophet Mohammed, runs a charitable foundation funding the poor in Africa and Asia.

Sarkozy wrote in the letter - published in full by Mediapart - that he offered the status after 'my government informed me about your project to establish in France an important delegation of the Swiss foundation, the Aga Khan Development Network'.

It was approved by Mr Sarkozy's budget minister Eric Woerth, MP for Chantilly, north of Paris, where the Aga Khan owns an estate and plunged millions into a historic racetrack and equestrian centre.

Mr Woerth is currently at the centre of two corruption enquiries, including the so-called 'Bettencourt Affair', which could see both he and Mr Sarkozy prosecuted.

The Paris mansion Sarkozy shares with his third wife, Carla Bruni, was raided by police after he lost his presidential immunity from prosecution.

Both Mr Sarkozy and Mr Woerth deny any wrong-doing.
