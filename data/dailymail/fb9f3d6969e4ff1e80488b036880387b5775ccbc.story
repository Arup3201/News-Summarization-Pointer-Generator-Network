'Sweets, games, friends,' Mrs Jones says 
as she gears up for the event, to which worried her husband quizzes, 
'Did we think this all the way through?'

The father-of-six adds that each year the birthday parties get 'bigger and bigger' as his children continue to grow.

Mr and Mrs Jones, who first started dating at high school and are now in their late-thirties, said before the birth of their quintuplets they had the 'perfect life.'

After marrying at the age of 23 they went on to build their 'dream house' and have a daughter together.Â 

However, when they decided to have one more child via fertility treatment they ended up with five and their life turned upside down over night.

Along with their finances taking a blow, the Joneses also felt their relationship suffer.

In a previous installment of Quints by Surprise, Mr Jones admitted that suddenly having so many children left little time for him and his wife.

'Right now 
it's definitely a detriment to our marriage.

'I miss my wife, I miss our 
old life,' he said when the quintuplets were around the age of two.

However, he determinedly added that he was going to going to stick it through as a family 'no matter how crazy life gets.'

Along with his relationship, Mr Jones also found it difficult balancing fatherhood with work.

In this Sunday's episode he says: 'When I finally get home at the end of the day, I get attacked. It is just a constant mirage of hugs and jumping on my back.

'One moment can be total chaos, next minute complete joy.'

While his wife stays at home looking after the children, Mr Jones runs a construction company.

The family first shot to fame in 2010 when TLC premiered season one of Quints by Surprise.

There were 22 episodes in total but the family haven't appeared on television since 2011.

Mrs Jones concludes in the upcoming one-hour installment of Quints by Surprise: 'There is never a dull moment in the Jones
 house.

'Now we're dealing with even stronger personality. These last 
five years have definitely been an adventure.'
