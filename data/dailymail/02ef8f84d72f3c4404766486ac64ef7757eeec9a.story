An Australian man attacked by three savage American Staffordshire Terriers was so badly mauled that witnesses said his internal organs were visible.

Two men who rushed to the aid of jogger Rob Nelson after the three dogs went for him in Sydney said he was 'screaming for mercy' as they dragged him into the road and began mauling at him 'like fierce animals ripping apart an animal.'

Mr Nelson, 49, was today undergoing an operation in Liverpool Hospital, in Sydney's western suburbs, as paramedics said the injuries to his lower body were so severe his internal organs were visible.

The jogger was mauled and chewed upon for about five minutes before two men drove the crazed animals, identified as two males and a female, off by striking them with a hammer and a pot plant.

One of the rescuers, Chris Thompson, 40, said the scene was horrific.

'I was in the back yard working and I heard the bloke scream for mercy and I ran out at a 100 miles an hour and ran into the dogs and tried to put a kick into them.

'They were gnawing on his shoulder the way dogs do when they have a knuckle of a bone,' he told Australian media.

The bites were so severe, he said, that not only the flesh but also the tendons and muscles were torn from Mr Nelson's arms.

Mr Thompson's friend, Colin McEwen, 54, was badly bitten on the hand when he tried to help.

'I grabbed a pot plant and cracked it over the dogs' heads and the shock made them disperse, but then they came back and latched onto Colin's hand,' said Mr Thompson.

'I got a hammer and smacked it straight in the snout and it did nothing. It was wagging its tail like it had done good.

'Colin was on the ground and it went for his head but I got it with a hammer just in time and just missed Colin's head by inches.'

Paramedic John Brotherhead said Mr Nelson had suffered some of the worst injuries he had seen in 27 years as a paramedic.

'His upper body was so traumatised I had to insert an intravenous drip through his feet.

'His height has probably saved him. A child or younger person would have had no hope warding off those dogs. The attack would have been fatal.'

A passing bus pulled up at the scene and some of the passengers got off to offer their help to the badly injured runner.

When police arrived they were so concerned about their own safety that one of the dogs had to be tasered.

The owner of the dogs, which have been caught by council rangers and are being held in a pen, has agreed that they should be put down. He is expected to face charges.

Police detective superintendent Jim Johnson said today that 'if a child or young person had been attacked, I have no doubt whatever that that child would have suffered fatal injuries.
