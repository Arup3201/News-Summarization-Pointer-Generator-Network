Wolfsburg's Junior Malanda produced one of the biggest misses you are ever likely to see on Friday night.

Facing defending champions Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga opener, the 19-year-old defensive midfielder found space in the area to shoot but goalkeeper Manuel Neuer managed to tip the effort onto the bar.

However, first to the rebound and virtually stood on the goal line, Malanda somehow managed to miss the target.

Nightmare: Wolfsburg midfielder Junior Malanda produced a horror miss against Bayern Munich on Friday night

Easy does it: Malanda was stood almost on the goal line and looked destined to equalised against Bayern

How did he miss? The Wolfsburg midfielder was first to the rebound but managed to shoot wide

Shooting as the ball crashed back down off the bar, the Belgian - with a chance to equalise - seemed to shin the ball and watched on in horror as it sailed out of play for a goal kick.

Appalled by the error, Malanda sunk to the floor with his hands on his head and Bayern Munich went

It's fair to assume the miss will replay in Malanda's head over and over again for some time to come - especially as Bayern held on to the 2-1 victory win.

Horror miss: Malanda can't believe his miss with Wolfsburg trailing 2-1 to Bayern Munich in the season opener
