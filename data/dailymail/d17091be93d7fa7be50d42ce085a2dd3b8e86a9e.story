A campaign group has launched a fake advertising campaign poking fun at controversial Toronto mayor Rob Ford as the city's mayoral election looms.

The group, No Ford Nation, has erected several posters around the Canadian city, which are trying to persuade voters to elect an alternative mayor.

Mr Ford has become notorious for his associations with alleged drug dealers, drunken outbursts and unpredictable behaviour - but has consistently dismissed calls for his resignation.

This week, posters from No Ford Nation have sprung up across Toronto using fake mayoral candidates with election promises such as: 'If elected, I promise I will just get publicly drunk. Anyone's better than Rob Ford.'

Another says: 'Elect Jeff McElroy. He promises to just smoke pot as mayor. Not crack.'

The third states: 'When I urinate in public, I never get caught on camera.'

And the posters have attracted massive attention across Canada, going viral on social media.

The posters, using fake candidates are by campaign group, No Ford Nation, who want to see a new leader elected to serve Toronto

No Ford Nation, say they are not anti-Ford but pro-Toronto ahead of the mayoral election in the city, which takes place in October

No Ford Nation say on their website their aim is to see a new leader elected to serve Toronto.

They state: 'With the upcoming election we have a chance to turn things around by electing someone who is qualified to be our mayor.

'Our mission is to ensure that the next mayor is a genuine leader that can properly represent Toronto. Itâ€™s up to voters to choose someone fit for the job.'

A Facebook page representing the group has also been created by Christina and Jason Robins, who write on the page that they are not 'anti-Ford' but 'pro-Toronto'.

They explain: 'Welcome to No Ford Nation, where our goal is to stop and highlight the divisive nature of Ford Nation and the lack of respect this administration has for the rules of City Council and the residents of this city.

'We are not an Anti-Ford page, we are Pro-Toronto page and our mandate is to have a livable city for all regardless of social status and income.

'We aim to protect our libraries, our social programs that help so many who may not survive without them and return our city to the inclusive amazing supportive and caring city it was before people made the Ford mistake.'

The mayoral election in Toronto takes place in October.
