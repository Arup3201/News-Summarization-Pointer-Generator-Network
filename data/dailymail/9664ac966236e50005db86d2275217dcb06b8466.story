Diego Maradona thinks Steven Gerrard and England's defence should be held responsible for the defeat to Uruguay that crushed their World Cup hopes.

The Argentina legend singled out Gerrard for his part in the 2-1 loss, saying the England captain 'could have done better' in both goals that were scored by his Liverpool team-mate Luis Suarez.

The 1986 World Cup hero thinks the skipper could have tracked Uruguay's Nicolas Lodeiro better for the first goal, before he 'made a mess' by nodding the ball into Suarez's path for the second.

'For England, who dominated the second half but were let down by the final pass or the final touch, it was the same old story of what could have been,' said Maradona, as reported by the Times of India.

'Gerrard and the English defence must take the blame for both Uruguay goals. When Lodeiro started his run before the first, Gerrard could have done better.

'But Lodeiro passed it perfectly for (Edinson) Cavani, whose sublime cross eluded the central defenders and found an unmarked Suarez waiting joyously inside the box.

'It was Gerrard again who made a mess of a long shot from the Uruguayan goalkeeper after England had equalised.

'The ball went to Suarez, who once again found a lot of room in the penalty area before unleashing a ferocious shot.

'You can't afford that with a striker of his class and England paid the price.'

And Maradona thinks the game was won and lost between Suarez and Wayne Rooney.

'Apart from scoring the only English goal, Rooney headed one on to the crossbar and on another occasion, failed to beat the goalkeeper from close-range,' he said.

'It summed up the tale of the two strikers.

'Suarez became a hero by converting two of the chances he got, Rooney capitalised on just one of several he had, and that made the difference in the fate of the teams.

'Uruguay won because they were better in handling their scoring opportunities.'
