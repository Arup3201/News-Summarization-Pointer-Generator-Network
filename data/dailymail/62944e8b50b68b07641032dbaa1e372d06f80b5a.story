An obese mother-of-one has shed almost half her body weight to land her dream job as a PE teacher.

Amy Richardson, 29, from Mirfield, West Yorkshire, felt her ambition was slipping away because of her weight, which had rocketed to over 19 stone.

Although she had studied sports development at university, Amy always felt a fraud because she was so big she had to wear men's sportswear, and couldn't walk up two flights of stairs without getting out breath.

Amy, who said she had always been a 'chubby child', often felt self-conscious when wearing a leotard for her favourite hobby of trampolining.

But by going on a life-changing diet she managed to lose 7st 11lb, and slimmed from a size 24 to a slender 12.

Now 11st 4.5lb, Amy finally teaches sports at a secondary school and feels full of energy, enjoying exercise and eating healthy home-made meals with her 17-month-old daughter Emily.

She said her weight began to effect her everyday life when she went to university.

'It was the first time I'd lived away from home, I was eating all the wrong things and going out with my friends most nights.

'At the time I didn't think about what I
 was eating and drinking at all, but looking back it's no wonder my 
weight went up to more than 19 stone.'

She continued: 'My joints ached, I got out of breath 
easily and I lost all my confidence. On nights out I'd just sit in the 
corner while all my friends were on the dance floor.

'I felt like a fraud. I was doing sports development at 
university, yet I found it difficult to climb the two flights of stairs 
to my lectures and had to wear men's sportswear because of my size.

'I couldn't imagine any school wanting to employ an overweight PE teacher and I knew I needed to do something.'

Her mother Lynne joined Slimming World in 2005, and a few months later Amy went along too, after a friend agreed to go with her. The effect was almost immediate.

She cooked recipes from their website, and ditched takeaways and microwave meals in favour of making food from scratch.

Her favourite things to cook include home made burgers with extra lean mince, homemade chips, and jacket potatoes with beans and salad.

'I taught myself how to cook lots of healthy meals and found things that I'd thought were bland before tasted so much better when I made them myself.

'I could still have treats like chocolate or alcohol too, so I didn't have to miss out on nights out, and lots of my friends didn't even realise I was slimming.'

She added: 'Before I went to the 
group I was scared, I worried what people would think of me and though I
 might be the biggest person there.

'After a few weeks I saw how well it worked - I was even Slimmer of the Month - and I was hooked.'

As the pounds melted away, Amy's energy and fitness levels improved, along with her confidence.

After leaving university five stone slimmer, she successfully got a job as a PE teacher in 2008.

'I couldn't believe I'd achieved my dream and had the job I'd always wanted. There's no way I'd have been able to do this job at 19 stone.

'Now I can keep up with the kids, demonstrate things I want them to do, and I don't have to worry about my size at all.

'I've lost another 2st 11lbs since I've been at the school, and I think it's good for my students to see that I haven't followed some silly fad diet, I've lost weight sensibly and kept it off.'

Amy, mother to 17-month-old Emily, has lost another 2st 11lbs since teaching at the school

Amy, who lives with fiance Chris and their daughter, has carried on with the classes every week, even during her pregnancy.

She said: 'I always joke that I've taken the scenic route to my weight-loss journey. Right from the start I was determined that I didn't want a quick fix, I wanted to make a change for life, and I know I've definitely done that.

'I've never felt like I was missing out, and eating healthily and being active are just part of my life now.

'I know I'll be able to pass everything Slimming World's taught me onto Emily so she'll never have to struggle with her weight like I did, which is an amazing feeling.

'I've got the figure I always wanted, my dream job, the perfect fiance and a beautiful baby girl. Being named Slimming World's Miss Slinky 2014 is just the icing on the cake.'
