New York's JFK Airport may deal with some of the fastest planes in the sky, but its runways are at risk from being put out of use by some of the slowest creatures on earth: turtles.

The airport is located alongside Jamaica Bay and has been plagued in recent years by turtles, which have started to cross over runways as they attempt to find a nesting ground.

During last year’s mating season airport employees had to carry 1,300 turtles off the tarmac to safety.

The turtles have become a slow-moving nuisance to the airport, causing runway closures and delays for passengers.

The airport is already running at capacity as it tries to move 47 million passengers every year in and out of the complex swiftly.

In an effort to keep the planes running on time and the turtles safe, Port Authority of New York and New Jersey officials are installing piping along runways to keep the turtles out.

Tracking: One of 200+ turtles picked up by hand at JFK Airport this month, marked for temporary ID with polish that will soon wash off.

Project: The airport is going to install 4,000ft of plastic piping along the runway that runs closest to the bay in an effort to prevent turtles from crossing the massive runways

Turtle power: Last year there were 1,600 turtles that had to be carried off the runways to safety. Not only are their lives at risk but a turtle could do serious damage to an aircraft engine

'We’re trying to find a balance between nature and aviation,' Port Authority spokesman Ron Marsico told the New York Post.

'We don’t want to see the turtles get hurt, and this should keep the airport running smoothly.'

The airport will install 4,000 feet of 8-inch plastic piping along the runway 4L which runs closest to the bay.

The barrier will apparently come just in time: The Port Authority’s Twitter account recently posted a few photos of 200 turtles that were cleared from the area.
