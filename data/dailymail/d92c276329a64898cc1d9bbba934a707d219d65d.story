A mother and daughter have today been jailed after dealing crack cocaine from an alleyway.

Terry Beaumont, 51, and her daughter Jane Leonard, 33, appeared at Teesside Crown Court alongside two others involved in conspiracy to supply Class A drugs.

Prosecutor Sue Jacobs told the court that police had observed the home of Leonard over three days in February last year and saw both mother and daughter, as well as co-defendant Jake Hutchinson, meeting people in the alleyway to the back of the house.

Mother and daughter Terry Beaumont, 51, and Jane Leonard, 33 (pictured right and left at Teesside Crown Court today) were jailed for two and a half years each today after being caught dealing crack cocaine in an alleyway

Officers
stopped Beaumont in the alley behind the house in central 
Stockton-on-Tees, and found her carrying a package of crack cocaine.

When they went into the home, a fourth defendant  - Alex Ibbotson, 21 -  was seen throwing more packages of crack - with a street value of £505 - on to the floor.

He had a further £657 worth of the drug hidden on his person.

Hutchinson, 19, had also been seen throwing packages to the floor. These were found to be heroin worth £74. A small amount of tamazepam was also found.

More crack was found on Beaumont and around the home.

Mrs Jacobs said the overall value of the drugs recovered was £1,254 of crack cocaine and £85 of heroin.

Ibbotson, of Blackbush Walk, Thornaby, Stockton, Leonard, now of Norcliffe Street, North Ormesby, Middlesbrough, and Beaumont, of Green's Beck Road, Hartburn, in Stockton, pleaded guilty to conspiring to supply crack cocaine.

Hutchinson denied this charge.

Hutchinson, of Sun Gardens, Thornaby, Leonard and Beaumont admitted conspiring to supply heroin between the same dates. Ibbotson denied this charge.

Hutchinson also admitted possession of the Class C drug tamazepam. Mrs Jacobs said all pleas were accepted.

Paul Abrahams, defending Leonard, said his client had played a 'lesser role' and added: 'She, and it would appear her mother, have been used by others to sell drugs. They are the ones that go out.'

Sean Grainger, for Beaumont, said: 'Her position is she was simply passing on drugs so she could get drugs from people further up the chain.'

Robert Mochrie, defending Ibbotson and Hutchinson, said both his clients accepted they faced an immediate jail term and asked for credit for their early guilty pleas.

Judge Peter Armstrong jailed Beaumont and Leonard for two-and-a-half years and Ibbotson for three-and-a-half years.

Hutchinson was sent to a young offenders' institution for two-and-a-half years.

The judge said: 'This sort of drug dealing results in immediate custodial sentences.

'As has been said, the main mitigation, if not the only mitigation, is you pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity and, as such, you are entitled to a third from the sentence.'

After the hearing Detective Constable Max Leonard, of the Stockton drugs unit, said: 'This gang who blighted the streets of Stockton by dealing drugs from back alleys were caught following an intelligence-led operation.

'All information received from the public is acted upon, and we would ask those with information on drugs in their area to contact police on 101 or call the charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555111.'
