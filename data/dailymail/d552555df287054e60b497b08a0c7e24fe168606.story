Jose Mourinho claims he would always play a strong team against tough opponents after Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers elected to rest a number of first-teamers for his side's clash with Real Madrid.

Mourinho, whose Chelsea team take on Liverpool at Anfield on Saturday, admitted it was difficult to comment before the match but claimed Rodgers' decision to field a weakened side could be a stroke of genius.

'If one day I go to a game and I don't feel I can win, maybe I don't go. So, normally, against the most difficult opponents, normally I will try to go with my best team, but who knows?,' said the Chelsea manager.

'Liverpool might play a fantastic match and win and rest players and the players are in great condition to play against Chelsea. In this case it might be a genius decision. In football it is difficult to comment.'

'I decide not to speak about our fixtures. Speak, don't speak, it goes always in the same direction. 

'If Liverpool decide to rest players when they play against the European champions it's a question for the Liverpool manager, it's not a question for me. What I think is not important and doesn't change the situation.'
