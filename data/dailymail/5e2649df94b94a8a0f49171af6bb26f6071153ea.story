Hollywood actor Martin Freeman is today unveiled by Labour as the first big celebrity endorsement of the election campaign.

The star of the Hobbit, Sherlock and The Office is to appear in a party political broadcast in which he contrasts the 'choice' between Labour and the Tories.

But in a surprise move, the video lasting almost three minutes has no mention of Labour's leader Ed Miliband.

Recruiting Freeman to the Labour cause is a coup for the party which has in recent years relied on comedian Eddie Izzard and actor Richard Wilson to bring some celebrity stardust.

In the video, due to be aired on television tomorrow night, he appears against a white backdrop talking directly to the camera about the choice the country faces on May 7.

'Now we are in the run-up to a General Election and over that time you're going to hear loads of claims from people on the Left, on the Right, all over the place. I

'It's going to drive you mad. It'll probably drive me mad but don't switch off yet,' he says.

The 44-year-old says the election will focus on a 'choice about what kind of country we want to live in'. He adds: 'I don't know about you, but my values are about community, compassion, decency; that's how I was brought up.'

He claims the Tories will take the country on a 'rollercoaster of cuts' while Labour will 'make sure the economy works for all of us, not just the privileged few, like me, but it's not just about that'.

Labour leader Ed Miliband is not mentioned in the broadcast, as polls suggest the Labour party is more popular than its leader

Not every celebrity has been supportive of Ed Miliband's Labour party, not least his plans to impose a levy on homes worth £2million.

Singer Myleene Klass on Labour's mansion tax: 'When you do look at the people who are going to be suffering this tax, it's true a lot of them are grannies who have had these houses in their families for a long, long time.' 

Actor Maureen Lipman: 'The Chuka Harman Burnham Hunt Balls brigade? I can't, in all seriousness, go into a booth and put my mark on any one of them. For the first time in five decades, I shall not be voting Labour.'

Presenters Ant and Dec on Labour and Miliband: Ant McPartlin: I feel we're both staunchly Labour and would vote Labour if we could, but I don't know what their philosophy is any more.' Declan Donnelly: 'I'm not sure I could picture him [Miliband] as prime minister.'

Singer Cheryl Fernandez-Versini: Said the mansion tax would 'f*** me over', adding: 'I've always been Labour all my life but I want to hear what they've got to say for myself.'

Presenter Bill Oddie: 'I hereby confess that I am one of the Mansion owning North London set that are apparently staunch Labour. Not this time. I shall vote GREEN.' 

The actor claims the Tories 'don't believe in the NHS' and 'have got sod all to offer the young'.

'But, real though all that stuff is and important though it is if you're young in this country, or broke in this country, or if you're unwell in this country - and let's face it we all need the NHS at some point - or if you are just plain working hard and finding life tough, there is a choice of two parts.

'The bottom line is what values are we choosing, because in the end this choice we make really does matter.' 

Freeman claims Labour 'start from the right place - community, compassion, fairness - I think all the best things about this country'.

'I love this country so much and I love the people in it, and I think you do too, but really, for me, there's only one choice; and I choose Labour.'

But Mr Miliband does not get a mention, perhaps an acknowledgement of polling which shows Labour is more popular than its leader.

Tory MP Nigel Adams said: 'Labour is trying to whitewash Ed Miliband from their campaign - his MPs don't want his photo on leaflets and now their party election broadcast doesn't even mention him.

'He's a weak leader who doesn't have the confidence of his party. Just imagine the chaos he would cause for Britain.'

A new ComRes poll for the Daily Mail shows 1 in 5 Labour voters think David Cameron would make a better Prime Minister than Mr Miliband.

Overall, 41 per cent of people would prefer a Labour-led government compared to 42 per cent who would like a Conservative-led administration.

The survey puts the Tories four points ahead of Labour on 36 per cent to 32 per cent, with Ukip on 12 per cent and Lib Dems 9 per cent.

Politics is often called showbusiness for ugly people, but celebrities have often been used to bring glitz to party election campaigns.

Broadchurch star and former Doctor Who David Tennant provided the voiceover for one of Labour's election broadcasts in 2010 and was pictured with Sarah Brown, wife of then prime minister Gordon Brown.

The Lib Dems received backing from Hollywood actors Colin Firth and Daniel Radcliffe. The Harry Potter star told US Vogue he would pick Nick Clegg's party 'without a shadow of a doubt'.

It is not always clear if celebrity endorsements help parties. Monty Python star John Cleese filmed a three-minute monologue for the Liberal Democrats in 1992, but the party's share of the vote fell by five per cent.

After Labour's landslide victory in 1997, Tony Blair invited dozens of celebrities to Downing Street for a 'Cool Britannia' party.

But guests including Noel Gallagher of Oasis later said they regretted going. He said: 'A lot of us got carried away with the New Labour thing, me included.

'When Tony Blair was courting the music business idiots like me thought we could have a say, but it became a publicity stunt on his behalf.' Sir Sean Connery has been a long-time supporter of the SNP. He described former first minister Alex Salmond as 'the best leader Scotland has ever had'.

Ukip's celebrity backers have included astronomer Sir Patrick Moore, who filmed a promotional video for the party.
