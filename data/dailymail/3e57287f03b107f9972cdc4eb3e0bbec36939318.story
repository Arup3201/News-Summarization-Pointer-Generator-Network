Scotland coach Vern Cotter has handed four Edinburgh players their first call-ups after naming his squad for next month's RBS Six Nations opener with France.

Scrum-half Sam Hidalgo-Clyne and forwards Ben Toolis, Hugh Blake and Hamish Watson are all included after impressing for Alan Solomons Gunners.

Grieg Laidlaw, meanwhile, will continue to skipper the Dark Blues in Grant Gilchrist's absence.

Ben Toolis, in action for Edinburgh, has earned his first call-up for the Scotland national side

Scotland manager Vern Cotter named his Six Nations 32-man squad with four uncapped Edinburgh players

Hidalgo-Clyne has featured in all of Edinburgh's Pro12 and European matches so far this season, having impressed with his kicking abilities.

Lock Toolis has caught the eye for Edinburgh, eighth in the Pro12 table, and will deputise in place of the injured Grant Gilchrist.

New Zealand-born Hugh Blake qualifies for Scotland through his grandparents and comes into the squad for the first time since arriving from Super Rugby outfit Highlanders back in December.

Watson completes the quartet having been previously invited to train with the international side in the Autumn but a broken jaw prevented him picking up his first cap. 

Forwards: Hugh Blake (Edinburgh Rugby), Fraser Brown (Glasgow Warriors), Blair Cowan, Geoff Cross (both London Irish), David Denton, Alasdair Dickinson (Edinburgh Rugby), Jonny Gray (Glasgow Warriors), Richie Gray (Castres), Ross Ford (Edinburgh Rugby), Jim Hamilton (Saracens), Rob Harley, Euan Murray, Gordon Reid (all Glasgow Warriors), Alasdair Strokosch (Perpignan), Ben Toolis, Hamish Watson (both Edinburgh Rugby), Jon Welsh (Glasgow Warriors).

Backs: Mark Bennett (Glasgow Warriors), Sam Hidalgo-Clyne (Edinburgh Rugby), Alex Dunbar, (Glasgow Warriors) Dougie Fife (Edinburgh Rugby), Stuart Hogg, Peter Horne (both Glasgow Warriors) Greig Laidlaw (capt, Gloucester), Sean Lamont, Sean Maitland, Henry Pyrgos, Finn Russell (all Glasgow Warriors), Matt Scott (Edinburgh Rugby), Tommy Seymour (Glasgow Warriors), Greig Tonks, Tim Visser (both Edinburgh Rugby).
