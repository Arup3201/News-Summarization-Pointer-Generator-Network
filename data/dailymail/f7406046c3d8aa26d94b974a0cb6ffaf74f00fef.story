A 'deals on wheels' cannabis gang which used a parked Mazda near a university as its mobile drug den has been jailed.

The group made £600 a day pushing the drug onto students in Cardiff after parking the black vehicle near its campus in Cathays. 

Four of its Kurdish members were jailed after being watched by police as they opened the car's door to one customer.

South Wales Police Officers found £3,650 of cannabis and £2,399 in cash inside. 

Haram Kalaf, 25, a failed asylum seeker and Saman Ahmed, 28, Nasir Karimi, 26, and Bakhutar Shakir, 28, were all handed sentences of between 13 and 21 months each. 

Cardiff Crown Court heard how the gang also used rental cars to shuttle drugs from the Mazda to customers. 

When police seized the vehicle they found 295 small bags of the drug hidden alongside thousands of pounds in cash stashed beneath the carpet. 

Nair Karimi had been living 'hand to mouth' for eight years before being jailed, the court heard

The gang was stopped when officers monitoring another of their cars watched them invite a young woman into the vehicle to buy £20 of the drug. 

'The car door opened as if to draw her attention, she got in and left seconds later', prosecutor Jason Howells said. 

'When she was stopped, she said "I’m sorry, I don’t want to get into trouble. I’ve just bought some weed for £20"'.  

After searching that vehicle, a Vauxhall Astra, they were taken to the Mazda where the majority of the haul was kept. 

Sentencing Judge Huw Rees said all of the men had come to the UK to sell drugs. 

'You came here with a single purpose, to supply cannabis, making a lucrative profit. 

'It was a well organised venture and the location you chose is significant - you came to an area of the city where students live, that intention is clear. 

'And you used an extra vehicle with the sole purpose of storing your hoard so that if you were caught, you would only have small amounts on you.' 

Kalaf, a failed asylum seeker from Bristol, told police he was selling £600 of drugs every day. 

Ahmed, a father-of-two, was recruited as his driver while Karimi had been living 'hand to mouth' since arriving in the UK eight years earlier. 

Shakir, a gambling addict, had previously been arrested for drug offences. 

The drug dealers parked the Mazda on Rhymney Street in Cardiff and used other vehicles to shuttle drugs around the city
