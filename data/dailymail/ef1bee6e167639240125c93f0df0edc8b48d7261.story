A convicted killer has been let off a curfew by magistrates because his history of domestic violence demands that he needs to be able to leave the house to calm down.

George Holtby, 46, had been sentenced to 200 hours unpaid work for drink driving.

But he was returned to court after claiming his back injury meant he was not fit to do the community work.

Magistrates were considering imposing an alternative punishment of a curfew, but they rejected this after being told by his probation officer that it was ‘not appropriate’.

Mark Sandbrook said Holtby needed to ‘take a step back’ if he became involved in a domestic argument and it would be better if he was able to leave his home.

As a result, Holtby was let off the unpaid work by Beverley Magistrates and ordered to complete an extra six months of supervision by the Probation Service instead.

Presiding magistrate Michael Bowman said: ‘I am reluctant to withdraw the punishment and not replace it with another, but for the reasons we have heard, there will be no curfew put in place due to issues of domestic violence.’

Victim: Holtby was jailed for eight-and-a-half years at Hull Crown Court in 2006 for strangling his former fiancée Miss Healey to death after she taunted him during sex

Wealthy: Miss Healey was a divorced mother-of-two who came from a billionaire family

Verdict: Holtby was cleared of murdering his on-off lover in her magnificent £1.9million manor house, but found guilty of manslaughter 'by reason of provocation'

Jailed: Holtby was released automatically after serving half his sentence for manslaughter

Holtby was jailed for eight-and-a-half years at Hull Crown Court in 2006 for strangling his former fiancée – wealthy heiress Suzy Healey – to death after she taunted him during sex.

He was cleared of murdering his on-off lover in her magnificent £1.9million manor house, but found guilty of manslaughter ‘by reason of provocation’.

Miss Healey, a divorced mother-of-two, came from a billionaire family. She had a drink problem and was regarded as an eccentric animal lover.

She threw Holtby out of the house after he was made redundant. He killed her in a jealous rage when he visited her on the day she celebrated her 40th birthday. Holtby was released automatically after half his sentence.

Magistrates were told on Monday that he had rebuilt his life and had been living with a new partner in South Cave, East Yorkshire. They were running a pet-sitting business together. But Holtby was sent back to prison last December because of an incident of domestic violence, details of which were not disclosed.

After his release Holtby, who has a long-term drink problem, was arrested for drink driving.

In May magistrates imposed a 44-month driving ban and ordered him to do 200 hours unpaid work and attend a nine-day alcohol programme.

Commenting on the curfew option, Mr Sandbrook told the court: ‘I advise magistrates to continue to monitor Mr Holtby’s relationship issues as the supervision requirement. A curfew would not be deemed appropriate.

‘As with cases of domestic violence, we urge people involved to take a step back from a situation if it arises, and, with a curfew in place, Mr Holtby may be at risk of not being able to leave his home.’

The supervision order imposed on Holtby means he must attend appointments with his probation officer, responsible for discussing and supervising his behaviour. 

Home: Miss Healey was regarded as an eccentric animal lover, who shared her home with a menagerie of pets

Split: Holtby and Miss Healey were engaged, but she threw him out the house after he was made redundant
