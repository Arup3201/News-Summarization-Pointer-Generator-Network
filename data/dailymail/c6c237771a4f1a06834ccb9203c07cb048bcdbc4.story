Manchester United recorded their fourth straight Premier League win since losing to rivals Manchester City at the beginning of November as they beat Stoke 2-1 at Old Trafford on Tuesday night.

Marouane Fellaini gave the home side the lead in the 21st minute, but Louis van Gaal's side were pegged back by Steven Nzonzi first-half strike before Juan Mata scored what proved to be the winning goal.

STOKE

Asmir Begovic 6

Hardly had anything to do but should have given his defence a shout for Fellaini's goal-line.

Phil Bardsley 5.5

One of three ex-United players in the team, and first in the book for foul on Wilson.

Ryan Shawcross 6

Another United old boy, he equipped himself well to keep RVP quiet.

Total mismatch with Fellaini for the opening goal, and one which he lost without a proper challenged.

Brought in to protect the defence but he couldn't keep pace with the lively Herrera.

Steven Nzonzi 7

Scored a thunderbolt equaliser from outside the box.

Wasn't at the races and his main contribution was a hack at Wilson which could have been red.

Set up Stoke's goal with a thrilling run and his control always perplexed United's defence.
