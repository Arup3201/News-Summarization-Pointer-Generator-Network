Ed Balls has threatened to quit the Shadow Cabinet if he is replaced as Shadow Chancellor by David Miliband, it was claimed yesterday.

Mr Balls fired his warning shot after Ed Miliband yesterday revealed the 'door is open' to his brother returning to frontline politics – and refused to say that he has guaranteed the Treasury job to Mr Balls.

A day earlier, David used a Commons speech on welfare to say Labour should accept the Government's spending plans – which Mr Balls has so far refused to do.

Some of Ed Miliband's allies want him
to replace Mr Balls because the latter is too closely associated with 
the profligate spending under the last government.

The Labour leader has twice offered 
the shadow chancellorship to his brother, who stood down from the 
frontbench when his sibling beat him to the leadership in 2010.

If David cannot be coaxed back, many would like to see the job go to former Chancellor Alistair Darling.

But friends of Mr Balls said yesterday
he would return to the backbenches rather than take any other post – an
ultimatum that threatens a return to the divisive Labour wars of the 
Blair-Brown years.

The left-wing New Statesman magazine 
reported: 'Both Eds insist there's no deal to keep Balls in the Treasury
brief, yet Miliband would face a revolt by MPs if he offered the post a
third time to his big brother, David. Allies of the Shadow Chancellor 
whisper that he'd take his bat and balls away and retire to the 
backbenches rather than swallow demotion.'

Relations between the Milibands were badly damaged when the younger brother triumphed in the Labour leadership in September 2010

The piece was written by the hugely 
experienced journalist Kevin Maguire, who has been close to the 
Brown-Balls camp for two decades.

Mr Balls' aides dismissed the claims about an ultimatum as 'rubbish'.

But evidence is growing the Labour 
leadership is keen to accommodate David Miliband on the front bench.  
And Ed Miliband yesterday said the rift in their relationship was 
healed, adding: 'I wouldn't take it as indication about a change in his 
view he's not coming back to the shadow cabinet, but the door is open.'

Asked if Mr Balls was guaranteed to 
keep the Shadow Chancellor's post up to the election, Mr Miliband said: 
'I think Ed Balls is doing a great job but I am not going to get into 
that [naming your Cabinet two and a half years before the election].'

Shadow chancellor Ed Balls has been told his job is not guaranteed until 2015

But according to reports Mr Balls would refuse to move to another job.

'Both Eds insist that there’s no deal to keep Balls in the Treasury brief, yet Miliband would face a revolt by MPs if he offered the post a third time to his big brother, David,' the left-leaning New Statesman reported.

'Allies of the shadow chancellor whisper that he’d take his bat and balls away and retire to the back benches rather than swallow demotion to another portfolio.'

An aide to Mr Balls dismissed the suggestion as 'total rubbish'.

David Miliband gave a bullish speech in the Commons yesterday, where he attacked the government’s plans to cap benefits rises at one per cent.

But in a sharp departure from Labour policy he appeared to accept the coalition’s overall spending plans in full.

‘The Government themselves have projected the total cost of all benefits, all tax credits and all tax relief for the next few years, and I am happy to debate priorities within that envelope,’ he said.

‘I will take the envelope that they have set, but let us have a proper debate about choices, not the total sum—a priorities debate, not an affordability debate.’

But in an apparent slip, he also revealed his shortcomings in maths which could hamper his chances of becoming shadow chancellor, when he told Tory MP David Davies: ‘I do not want to give the you a maths lesson - I did not get good marks in maths - but percentages are percentages.’

Ed Miliband’s first shadow chancellor Alan Johnson never recovered after joking that his first job was to ‘pick up a primer in economics for beginners’.

Labour deputy chairman Tom Watson has revealed the party believes a 60-seat Commons majority in 2015 was now 'realistic'.

The shadow cabinet approved his strategy to concentrate on 106 key marginal 
constituencies.

It is to concentrate funds on training US-style community organisers and
using social media in target areas in a bid to emulate Barack Obama's 
electoral success in the US.

However, it suggests Mr Miliband;s hopes of becoming PM depend on gains in Midlands and the North, with just nine seats targeted in the South East.

Meanwhile David Cameron briefed Tory MPs last night that the party would focus on winning 40 seats from Labour and the Lib Dems and shoring up support in 40 of its most marginal seats.
