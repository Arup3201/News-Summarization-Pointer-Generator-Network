Almost a fifth of young people have never set foot on a British beach, a survey has revealed.

With cheap flights to places with white sands and a higher chance of sunshine, we are being lured away from the likes of Brighton, according to a poll of 2,000 adults.

Where once millions of people took full advantage of our status as an island nation, almost a third of us now feel guilty about not doing enough on our doorstep.

Days gone by: As an island nation we once flocked to beaches like Brighton, pictured - but now almost a fifth of those under 35 have never set foot on a British beach, a survey has found

The research comes amid a battle by Britain's seaside resorts to halt what some people fear could be a terminal decline.

Some
 have been reinvented as a novel throwback to Britain's past, with 
council bosses in Margate, Kent, hoping to build a heritage theme park.

Others, however, are in decay - which may explain why so many British landmarks go unrecognised.

Half of those questioned in the poll did not recognise the 560ft Spinnaker Tower in Portsmouth (pictured) thinking it was in Dubai

Half
 of those questioned in the poll did not recognise the 560ft Spinnaker 
Tower in Portsmouth, thinking it was in Dubai instead.

Some
 confused Brunel's Clifton Suspension Bridge with the Golden Gate Bridge
 in San Francisco, while others thought Cornwall's open-air Minack 
Theatre was in Greece.

And 55 per cent of those questioned thought tranquil Wast Water, in the Lake District, was actually Lake Geneva in Switzerland.

The research was paid for by the train firm First Great Western in a bid to promote British tourism.

It found almost a fifth of those polled (18 per cent) admitted they had seen more landmarks abroad than they had in the UK.

And more than half of those quizzed plan to book a holiday this month in a bid to banish the January blues.

Train firm spokesman Philip Edgerton said: 'As the January blues set in, so does the longing for the great British summer.

'We
 see an increase in people booking leisure travel, getting ready for the
 summer and giving themselves something to look forward to.'

The
 research was commissioned to mark the launch of the train company's 
Facebook app, Inside Track, which gives travellers tips and local 
knowledge.

It includes a 
woodland walk in The Cotswolds recommended by Blur bassist Alex James, 
and a Somerset boutique frequented by model Daisy Lowe.
