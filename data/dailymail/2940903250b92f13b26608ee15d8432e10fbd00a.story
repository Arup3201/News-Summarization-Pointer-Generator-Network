Move over Essex lion - there's a new big cat in town, and he's living in deep in the Gloucestershire countryside.

That's what locals have claimed after seeing the hunt for a wild beast apparently on the loose in Essex hit the headlines nationwide over the bank holiday weekend.

Police eventually called off the search for the elusive lion after 24 hours, but wildlife experts in the west country say they have uncovered their own shadowy beast and the authorities should investigate.

'Panther' sighting: This picture taken in February 2012 shows a furry black figure sprinting through woodland near Nailsworth, Gloucestershire

It comes after this blurry picture of what resembles a big cat prowling around a patch of countryside near Nailsworth emerged.

The furry black figure was caught on a trip camera sprinting through woodland after apparently being spooked by a walker.

Hunters reckon the beast could be the feared Five Valleys big cat spotted by numerous members of the public over the last year.

Big cat tracker Frank Tunbridge believes this image gives further credence to his belief that big cats roam Gloucestershire and beyond

Big cat tracker Frank Tunbridge 
believes this image gives further credence to his belief that the 
animals roam Britain - after a lion was allegedly seen by holidaymakers at a caravan park near Clacton in Essex on Sunday night.

Frank Tunbridge said: 'I knew it was a big cat straight away. It looks like it could be a puma or small leopard.'

Following reports
of a wild animal on the loose, armed officers and two police 
helicopters using heat-seeking equipment, which cost £880 an hour to 
run, were scrambled.

Workers
from nearby Colchester Zoo carrying tranquilliser guns scoured the 
fields and residents were warned to stay indoors. Caravanners were 
temporarily moved to a nearby garden centre.

But the search was eventually called off after
 24 hours when officers found no trace of a lion. The witnesses 
however stood by their claims, insisting that the animal they saw was 
definitely a large cat.

The culprit was believed to be a three-year-old moggie called Teddy Bear, owned by Ginny Murphy, who said he does look quite lion-like.

A Maine Coon, which is the largest domestic cat breed and can weigh up to 25lb, Teddy Bear lives near the caravan park and likes wandering around in the field where witnesses claimed they'd seen the lion.

Speaking about the image he uncovered in Gloucestershire, Mr Tunbridge, 65, said: 'I knew it was a big cat straight away. It looks like it could be a puma or small leopard.

'I
 don’t know what sort of cat it is, but we have used the wooden steps in
 the photograph to scale it and we believe it is around 42in long.

'You can see that it’s not a Labrador - it has a cat’s profile. There have been so many other sightings in that area.'

The
 blurry picture of the creature, which measures about 20in up to the 
shoulder was snapped last week by a trip camera set up in a farmer’s 
field.

Mr Tunbridge took on the case after being handed the picture by the farmer, who does not want to be identified.

The unnamed farmer, who set up the camera after previously spotting the beast, said: 'I saw it in the lane near where I live.

Lion or tabby cat? Images similar to this one were handed to Essex police in August sparking a large-scale search for the 'Essex Lion'

'That’s why I put the camera up. It 
was a bit of a surprise to see this when I checked the camera. I have 
set up a video camera too now, but not had anything on it yet.'

The
 snap comes just months after footage, captured by Coryn Memory, was 
released showing a 6ft-long beast stalking through fields close by.

She
 first spotted a large black animal crossing the field near her house in
 Thrupp, near Stroud, Gloucestershire, in July 2009 and claims to have 
seen it five times since.

Earlier this year the devastated carcasses of three roe deer and three wallabies were found strewn across the county.

Teddy Bear, the Maine Coon owned by Ginny Murphie, pictured, is believed to have been mistaken for the Essex lion after he was possibly spotted stalking around his home in Clacton, Essex on Sunday

Look like a lion? Teddy Bear stalking through a stubble field near his home yesterday. On Sunday armed officers and two police helicopters which cost £880 an hour to run, were scrambled after reports of a lion

DNA
 was taken from the first deer, found dead by a dog walker at 
Woodchester National Park - just three miles from Coryn’s house - on 
January 4 this year.

The body had all of its vital organs missing and had its snout severed - the hallmarks of a panther-like kill.

But a team of scientists, lead by Dr Robin Allaby of Warwick University, failed to find any big cat DNA on the carcass.

Mr Tunbridge, from Gloucester, believes a walker may have accidentally disturbed the Nailsworth creature, causing it to flee.

He said: 'The route the cat was pictured on is a deer trail - which means the animal may have been hunting for food.

'This is just one of many sightings that get reported to me - I am getting around two-a-week at the moment.'

The sighting follows an apparent close encounter with a 'panther-like creature' reported on Cleeve Hill, Gloucestershire, last week.

Kieran Bourne, 30, believed he saw the animal in his headlights as he travelled to Cheltenham in the early hours of last Tuesday.
