Reasons for people changing their accent included trying to sound more sophisticated during a job interview or while trying to chat someone up (file picture)

It is ingrained in us in our formative years and becomes an intimate part of our identity.

But it seems some of us are never satisfied with our accent.

More than one in five Britons will change the way they talk from time to time, a study has shown.

From trying to sound more sophisticated at a job interview to wanting to impress on a date, the motives are many and varied.

Around 6 per cent have toned down their accent. But 5 per cent were proud enough of the way they spoke to have thickened it.

In news that will come as no surprise to former England manager Steve McClaren, ridiculed for his affected Anglo-Dutch accent in a TV interview after a spell working in Holland, we often mimic the speech patterns of the people around us.

Many of us will adopt a regional dialect when we move to a different area, and 4 per cent have even spoken English with a foreign accent.

According to the survey, some people have been forced to change their regional accents to help people understand them.

Just over 8 per cent of Britons have tried to make themselves sound more posh. And 4 per cent have tried to sound less posh – rising to 11 per cent in London.

Brummies were most likely to tone down their accent – 16 per cent admitted to softening their tones. Only 2 per cent of Scots have changed the way they talk.

Old Etonian Prime Minister David Cameron and even royalty have been accused of altering upper class accents.

For many of the well-heeled in politics or entertainment, there is often a need to appear to be more of a 'man of the people'.

While
 analysis of the Queen's Christmas speeches over the decades has shown 
her accent has become more 'estuary English' than before.

Five per cent of those surveyed said they have overplayed their own natural accent and six per cent have softened it.

Six per cent have tried using a different regional accent and four per cent have adopted a fake foreign one, said the survey.

Those
 most likely to reduce their natural accent are in the West Midlands 
where 16 per cent admit they have had occasion to soften their 
Birmingham tones.

But only two per cent of Scottish people admit they have ever reduced their regional accent for the sake of others.

Accents are not the only things Britons have faked, said the survey by artificial grass firm Trulawn. Two in three Brits have faked something from their tans to fur coats, it found.

Trulawn director Ian Parry said: 'Some things are simply unachievable - a year long real tan, expensive designer clothes and a perfectly manicured lawn for example.

'But savvy Brits are realising you can have it all and achieve perfection in all areas of your life at a fraction of the time or cost and that's why the trend for faking it is booming.

'There's also been a shift in attitude compared to a few years ago as people are no longer ashamed to admit when something is not the real deal and are now celebrating all things artificial.'

Gardening company Trulawn surveyed 1,000 adults.
