Romelu Lukaku has stunned Everton by saying he would like to move to a 'top club' after less than a season since making his move from Chelsea permanent.

The Toffees broke their transfer record with a £28million deal to lure the Belgium international away from Stamford Bridge last summer.

The 21-year-old has struggled to replicate the form that convinced Roberto Martinez to sign him after a prolific loan spell last season, although he has still managed 10 goals from 36 appearances so far this term.

The Belgium international misses the chance to score against his former club Chelsea on Wednesday

Lukaku returned to his former club for Everton's last-minute 1-0 defeat on Wednesday where he spoke of his desire to move to a club with greater ambitions.

'It was brilliant to play at Chelsea and I had a good reception,' Lukaku told The Sun.

'They know I'm a good player but that I want to develop so I can eventually get back to playing for a club like Chelsea.

'I don't have a secret ambition to rejoin — there are other clubs in the world. I just want to grow as a player and eventually arrive at a top club again.'

Roberto Martinez is unlikely to be impressed after shelling out £28m for the striker
