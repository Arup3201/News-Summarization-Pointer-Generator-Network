It seems Blackberry’s impending revamp is too little too late to save the aging platform’s exclusivity deal with the Pentagon.

The Pentagon wants to establish a ‘multi-vendor environment’ while still adhering to ‘strict security requirements’, spokesman Lieutenant Damien Pickart told News24.

The move comes just days after Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced it had bought $2.1 million worth of iPhones as Blackberry’s current platform just isn’t on the cutting edge anymore.

Losing exclusivity with civil servants is a trend Blackberry has been weathering for a while.

In February the General Services Administration announced it would expand support to iOS and Android in February, while the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said it would switch off Blackberry servers that same month.

When Blackberry was at the peak of its popularity, the reliable email and security were considered exceptional draws but now those features are common on competing phones.

The iPhone’s iOS security and its manufacturers were advantages which attracted the Immigration Department over the Android with a range of hardware supplied by unknown manufacturers.

Blackberry is betting everything on a revamp next year to win back millions of customers who have abandoned the device

Other major losses for Blackberry include US government consultant Booz Allen which announced its 25,000 staffers would no longer use the handsets and Yahoo’s decision last month that staff could have any device except a Blackberry.

The Canadian firm behind Blackberry, RIM, says it still has at least a million users in the U.S government.

The company is betting heavily on its six smartphone model releases in 2013 to win back the millions of users who have moved on to iPhones and Androids.
