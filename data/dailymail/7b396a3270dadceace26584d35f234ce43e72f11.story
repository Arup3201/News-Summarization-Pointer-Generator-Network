House prices in London have rocketed to a record high – but in the rest of the country they have plunged by up to 20 per cent since the credit crunch began.

The biggest risers are in Kensington and Chelsea, where the average property costs a record £1.089million.

In the past year, the price of a home in the London borough has jumped by an average of £150,000, or £12,600 every month, according to the Land Registry.

This rise is nearly six times the 
annual pre-tax wage of a typical full-time worker on £26,100. The 
average property in Kensington and Chelsea ‘earns’ the same in just over
two months.

But prices have fallen dramatically in the rest of the country.

Tracy Kellett, director of the buying 
agents BDI Home Finders, said: ‘Like a drunk uncle at a wedding, the 
housing market is still dancing in slow motion on the spot.

‘For every small step forward, there is an ungainly lurch backwards.

‘While London is making strong 
progress, prices are still dropping in the North.’ In the North West, 
one of the worst affected areas, the average home was worth £135,988 
when the credit crunch began in August 2007. Today it is worth £109,235.

This is equal to a drop of 19.6 per cent, or £26,753.

Estate agents told the Royal 
Institution of Chartered Surveyors how the market is ‘in the doldrums’ 
and that confidence is ‘very low.’ One agent, from Carlisle, Cumbria, 
said: ‘[The] market still lacks confidence with nothing in sight to 
suggest it might improve.

‘Vendors need to be prepared to 
compromise if they are to make progress with a planned move.’ In the 
North East, average prices have dropped below £100,000 to £98,557, 
falling by a further 3.8 per cent over the last year.

Overall, house prices in London have jumped 6.5 per cent over the last year to an all-time high of £367,785.

Peter Rollings, managing director of 
Marsh & Parsons, a specialist London estate agency, said: ‘There is a
chronic lack of supply [of homes for sale] and an overdose of demand.

‘People do not want to put their money
in a bank. The stock market is up and down like a yoyo. They are 
looking for a place to put their money, so they decide to buy a 
property.’ The cheapest one-bedroom flat in the area is currently on the
market for £300,000 while the most expensive is on the market for 
£2.25million, he said.

Overall, the Land Registry figures 
showed the price of the average home has risen by 0.3 per cent over the 
last year to £162,900.

Outside London, the most expensive 
county is Windsor and Maidenhead where the average home costs £342,596, 
up 5.5 per cent over the last year.

Land Registry figures do not include Scotland.
