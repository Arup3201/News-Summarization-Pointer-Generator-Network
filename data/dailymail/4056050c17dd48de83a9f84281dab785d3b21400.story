A Canadian college has come under fire after filming two students kissing against the bookshelves of an on-campus library for a new promotional video that has been likened to a 'beer commercial'.

In the video, dozens of attractive teenagers are captured solving math problems on a board, carrying out scientific research and discussing financial statistics to promote the University of Moncton.

However, they are also seen playing as hard as they work - from participating in a football game and dancing at a music concert with friends to attending a beach party at sunset.

In one short clip, a male and female student are even filmed hooking up in the university's library, as a narrator emphasizes that the French language is good reason to attend the New Brunswick college.

Controversial: The University of Moncton has come under fire after filming two students kissing against the bookshelves of a library (pictured) for a new promotional video that has been likened to a 'beer commercial'

Sparking outrage: Some social media users  criticized the advertising campaign for its 'sexy' theme, with one woman, with the handle @MLISmeg (pictured), tweeting: 'Disappointing representation/use of the #library'

Disapproving: Another user wrote of the new promotional video: 'Sex-negativity in action... #feminism'

'At the University of Moncton, our language is our pride. A force. It's a language of progress, of affairs. And other affairs,' the male narrator says in French, as the couple kiss amid the library stacks.

The steamy footage has sparked outrage among the university's professors and librarians, with many deeming it 'pathetic', 'similar to selling beer' and attracting the wrong sort of students.

Speaking to CBC News, Marie-Noelle Ryan, president of the university's association of librarians and professors, declared: 'It’s the way it’s like selling the university, like it’s a beer product.'

She added: 'It’s not the way that you will recruit serious students and people who really want to learn and have good diplomas.'

Student Simon Paulin agreed, saying: ​'I can understand how they are trying to bring popularity to it because young people think about it a lot. But still I don't think they should focus on that.

'It's not really professional, cause we're here to learn.'

Some social media users also criticized the advertising campaign for its 'sexy' theme, with one woman, with the handle @MLISmeg, tweeting: 'Disappointing representation/use of the #library.'

Another woman, Jeanne Fontaine Corm, wrote: 'Not the way I'd want to promote a university. What's the message here?'.  And one man joked: 'University of Moncton offering dental degrees.'

Defense: Some people claimed the footage was a 'smart' way to target potential students. One man (pictured) tweeted: 'I love the University of Moncton 'kissing' ad. It is hilarious to see the hatred towards it too'
