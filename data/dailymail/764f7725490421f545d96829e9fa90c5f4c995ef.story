They've got the Bugaboo pushchair and the Moses basket, and the Duchess of Cornwall has stocked up on organic baby food.

Now the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have been sent a Finnish maternity kit - which comes complete with a snowsuit, a teething toy and a pint-sized duvet - as they prepare for the impending birth of their first child.

The kit, which is issued to every Finnish mother, contains everything a new parent could possibly need while the box it arrives in doubles as a crib.

Items provided include socks and mittens, a knitted hat, a balaclava, a mattress, a selection of babygros and, more surprisingly, a box of nursing bra pads and some condoms.

The box also includes a set of non-disposable nappies - chosen, according to Tanja Jääskeläinen, the deputy head of mission at the Finnish Embassy in London, with the planet in mind.

'I cannot imagine that we would use commercial nappies,' she told the Times. 'It is always these traditional ones.

'I don't know how much people use them but people are more environmentally conscious now.'

She added: 'It is something that every mother looks forward to receiving, especially when you have your first child.

'There's so much that you don't know you need. When the box arrives, you look at the clothes and think, "They are so cute". You cannot imagine your baby is so small. Then the baby arrives and most of the things are too big.

A Kensington Palace spokesman said: 'We were delighted to receive the very kind gift of a maternity package from the Finnish Government.

'It was a very thoughtful gesture. I'm sure the Duke and Duchess will be very interested to see the contents.'

Although the Cambridges are the first members of the British Royal family to be sent the maternity kit, they aren't the only blue-blooded recipient.

When Sweden's Crown Princess Victoria was expecting her daughter, Princess Estelle, Duchess of Östergötland, last year, she was also sent a box.

Other preparations are continuing ahead of the impending Royal birth with the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall stocking up on baby food while on a visit to the Rhug Estate in Gwynedd yesterday.

The delighted Duchess was handed a box of organic infant treats by officials from baby food manufacturer, Plum.

Organic food and the environment are both issues close to Prince Charles' heart who will no doubt also be thrilled by the Finnish Government's choice of eco-conscious terrycloth nappies.

'It’s brilliant that HRH Prince Charles has been given some organic baby food for his first grandchild on his visit to the Rhug Estate,' commented the Soil Association's Jim Twine.

Twine, who is the organic foundation's head of business development, continued: 'The Prince will be making a choice to give his grandson or daughter one of the best starts in life in common with more than 50 per cent of parents who choose to buy organic baby food for their infants.

'Organic baby food guarantees parents are buying food produced without the use of almost all pesticides, all synthetic fertilisers and GM crops - ultimately giving parents confidence in the way in which in the food has been produced - with no hidden surprises.'

In London meanwhile, workmen outside St Mary's Hospital in Paddington could be seen setting up a press pen opposite the entrance to the Lindo Wing where the Duchess of Cambridge, 31, is due to give birth.

By last night, members of the world's media were already arriving to stake out their spot, as the baby's due date - 12th July - rapidly approaches.
