England must win the RBS 6 Nations title if they want any chance of glory in this year’s World Cup.

That is the verdict of hooker Dylan Hartley, who claims the team have put themselves under huge pressure ahead of the home clash with France.

‘I think, timing-wise, this team needs to win something before this World Cup,’ said the Northampton captain. ‘We’ve put that pressure on ourselves.’

England hooker Hartley claims they have put themselves under pressure ahead of their tie with France

Stuart Lancaster’s men face a tense afternoon, as championship rivals Wales and Ireland play before them — with the destination of the trophy likely to be decided by points difference.

The three leading countries have three wins apiece, but England are top of the table with a points difference of +37, set against Ireland’s +33 and +12 for Wales.

Wales face Italy in Rome then Ireland meet the Scots at Murrayfield, so by the time Lancaster’s side line up for a teatime ‘Le Crunch’ at Twickenham, they will know what is needed to earn only the second title success since 2003.

Hartley was a member of the side under Martin Johnson who claimed the trophy in 2011, but that feat — after a demoralising loss in Dublin shattered their Grand Slam hopes — does not fill a cherished place in the hooker’s memory. 

Asked where he kept his medal from that campaign, Hartley said: ‘It’s in a box at home somewhere. When you ask me if I have won the Six Nations, I don’t feel like I have. Maybe until the day we do the Grand Slam it probably won’t feel the same, either. There is always that hanging over us.’

Defeat in Ireland dashed hopes of a clean sweep this year, but Hartley suggested that securing a title — which would earn the home players a share of a pay-out worth in excess of £2million — in front of a full house at Twickenham would be ‘lovely’. 

He added: ‘It would be the best achievement in an England shirt, no doubt. All we can worry about is winning the game and letting everything else take care of itself. Our fate is still in our hands. If we get it all right and win well, I don’t think other results will matter.’

Forwards coach Graham Rowntree acknowledged that England could ‘do with winning any championship, any trophy’ and believes a home team containing several novices can handle the high stakes.

‘We’ve got full faith in the guys,’ he said. ‘I think we’ve shown calmness and leadership. We trust the lads’ decision-making.’
