Winning an Olympic gold should be a moment of great joy for any athlete at London 2012.

But for Chinese diver Wu Minxia securing her golden hat-trick on Sunday at the Aquatic Centre in east London was followed by shock and sadness.

Straight after a triumph in the women's Synchronised 3m Springboard that made her a legend in her sport, the 26-year-old's  family decided it was the right time to tell her a devastating family secret.

They admitted to their daughter that her grandparents died - over a year ago. And instead of telling her, they kept it back.

Wu's family also revealed that her mother had been battling breast cancer for several years, something Wu had no idea about.

The reasoning was clear: they wanted her to win at all costs and didn't want family matters to interfere with her diving career.

Wu, who with teammate He Zi won the last two synchronised gold medals in Athens and Beijing, was an overwhelming favourite to win gold again and successfully lead China's quest to unite every Olympic and world diving gold medal.

She was under intense pressure to succeed - and so were her family.

Father Wu Yuming said: 'It was essential to tell this white lie.'

Wu began diving training at the age of six, and left home at 16, bound for a government aquatic training institute.

She is one of her sport's brightest stars, and part of that is thanks to the price paid in her personal life.

'We accepted a long time ago that she doesn't belong entirely to us,' Wu Yuming told the Shanghai Morning Post.

'I don't even dare to think about things like enjoying family happiness.'

Wu's mother defended her decision by 
saying she decided to wait until her breast cancer was in remission 
before breaking the news to her daughter of her condition.

The admission has sparked a debate in China over the country's win-at-all-costs mentality when it comes to the Olympics.

The
 pursuit of success has been publicly chased by the government-backed 
sports national sports program with unshakeable zeal over the past two 
decades.

In a country 
where messages of congratulations from the government to athletes 
through the state news agency are only sent to gold medalists, not those
 winning silver or bronze, there now seems to be a backlash against this mentality.

The revelations about Wu followed fierce criticism from a national
 newspaper when a 17-year-old weightlifter failed to medal.
