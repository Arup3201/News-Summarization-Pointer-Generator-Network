The European Union is imposing new sanctions against Iran in a bid to force the country to come clean about its nuclear programme

A meeting of EU foreign ministers imposed restrictive measures intended to hit the country's treasury and increase pressure on its Islamic regime headed by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

Iran is still refusing to cooperate fully with the International Atomic Energy Agency regarding its nuclear programme, something which today’s Luxembourg meeting said was ‘acting in flagrant violation of its international obligations.’

Worry: Both German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle, left, and Britain's William Hague spoke positively about the sanctions imposed at today's EU meeting in Luxembourg

Today's meeting approved 'additional restrictive measures in the financial, trade, energy and transport sectors' against Iran as well as imposing asset freezes and trade restrictions on more companies, notably those 'active in the oil and gas industry.'

German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said the ministers had also banned the import of Iranian natural gas into EU nations.

Meanwhile a leading European satellite provider took 19 Iranian television and radio broadcasters off the air, a result of earlier sanctions which prompted accusations of censorship and threats to sue from Iranian state television.

The EU ministers also agreed to prohibit all transactions between EU and Iranian banks unless they were authorized in advance for humanitarian reasons.

No transparency: Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is still refusing to come clean about the country's nuclear programme insisting it is intended for peaceful purposes

Financial restrictions: The EU's foreign ministers hope that the new sanctions against Iranian trade and freezing of assets will hit the Islamic nation's treasury

They also tightened restrictions on the Central Bank of Iran and imposed more export restrictions ‘notably for graphite, metals, software for industrial purposes, as well as measures related to the shipbuilding industry.’

Maryam Rajavi, president-elect of the Iranian Resistance, an organisation seeking to oust Ahmadinejad’s regime, welcomed the decision to expand sanctions.

She called the move ‘an essential step to preclude this regime from acquiring nuclear weapons,’ and asked the EU to sever all economic and commercial ties with Iran.

On his way into Monday's meeting, British Foreign Secretary William Hague said new sanctions would be ‘a sign of our resolve in the European Union that we will step up the pressure.’

Hague said such pressure would 
continue to mount ‘over the coming months unless negotiations succeed. 
We remain open of course to success of negotiations.’

Many
countries fear that Iran is working to develop nuclear weapons but 
Iranian officials say the country's nuclear program is intended solely 
for peaceful purposes.

Suspected site: Lavizan Shiyan, a restricted area next to a military complex in a Tehran suburb, was thought to be a possible location for weapons of mass destruction

Possible base: An alleged facility in Natanaz, Iran which the regime also claims is completely harmless

The European broadcast satellite cutoff means state broadcaster Irib’s television channels are no longer broadcasted in Europe and elsewhere.

Satellite provider Eutelsat agreed with media services company Arqiva to block Irib's nine TV channels and ten radio stations as of Monday morning because of ‘reinforced EU council sanctions,’ Eutelsat spokeswoman Vanessa O'Connor said.

Irib was targeted in a round of EU sanctions against Iran adopted in March after European officials said its broadcasts violated human rights.

Iran's state-run Press TV said Irib could take legal action against Eutelsat over the cutoff ‘to compensate for any material and spiritual damages.’

Press TV says it was among the channels cut by the Eutelsat decision. Others include Farsi-language channels for Iranian expatriates and Arabic-language offerings, including the news channel Al-Alam.

In a statement, Press TV said the move ‘shows that the European Union does not respect freedom of speech and is a step to mute all alternative news outlets representing the voice of the voiceless.’
