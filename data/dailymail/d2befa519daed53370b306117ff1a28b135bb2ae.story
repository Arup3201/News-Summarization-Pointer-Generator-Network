Cleveland Indians fan Greg Van Niel may be his beloved team's newest recruit if his performance at Sunday's game against the Kansas City Royals is anything to go by.

The season-ticket holder caught four foul balls at Progressive Field, a once-in-several-lifetimes achievement.

'Three of them were catches and one was a ball I picked up off the ground,' Van Niel told the team after his spectacular sporting feat.

Van Niel wasn't sitting in his usual seat when he grabbed the four souvenirs during the Indians' 6-4 win.

He said some catches took a little more skill than others.

'The third one I think was the hardest one â€” I think I ended up sprawled across a few rows, and I got some cheese on myself. But the other ones were just a matter of being in the right place at the right time.'

Van Niel described the impressive grab, which was on a ball hit by Indians leadoff man Michael Bourn, as being highlight-reel worthy.

'Michael Bourn hit one that was off the facade, and that's where I was in the cheese fries,' he said.

'(That) one was crazy acrobatics. I was strewn across three rows, and I needed some assistance getting back.'

What a haul: Van Niel, circled after his third score, said he had never caught a foul ball before his amazing one-day haul

The mega-fan posed for a picture for the Indians clutching three of the souvenirs in his right hand.

He said he had never caught a foul ball before his amazing one-day haul.

There were 15,431 other fans at the Indians' final game before the All-Star break, but it's safe to bet none had a day quite like Van Niel.
