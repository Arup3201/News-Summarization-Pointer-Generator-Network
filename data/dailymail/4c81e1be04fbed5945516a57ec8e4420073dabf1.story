China claims to have conclusive proof that Japan forced Asian women to work as sex slaves during World War II.

Officials said that the evidence was found in a trove of 89 documents from the archive of the Japanese military police corps.Â 

The atrocities are said to have taken place between 1932 and 1945.

Some historians believe that up to 200,000 women - mostly from the Korean peninsula - were made to work in frontline brothels as 'comfort women'.

Recognition: Supporters of comfort women have continued to demand an formal apology from the Japanese government for their treatment in World War II

Appalled: Archive director Yin Huai said the documents' contents left staff chronically depressed

Shocking: China has released documents, which it claims prove the Japanese Army forced women into World War II brothels in Japan-controlled China

Since the 
war, Japanese politicians and authorities have repeatedly refused to be
 held accountable for the abuse of the women who were forced into 
prostitution.

As
 recently as 2007, Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe caused 
international outrage when he denied that they were made into the former
 Japanese Imperial Army's sex slaves, the Telegraph reported.

Comfort
 women were forced to work in occupied China, where brothels were set up
 in between 20 to 30 counties in the country's north-east region.

Jilin
 provincial archives research fellow Zhao Yujie told Reuters that 
documents show the Japanese military used the national general 
mobilisation act to forcibly conscript Korean comfort women.

He added that these Korean women sex slaves were dispensed to high-ranking officials.

Japan refuses to directly compensate surviving comfort women, stating all claims were settled by a bilateral treaty that normalised diplomatic ties in 1965

Another
 released document shows the recorded amount of women sent to have sex 
with Japanese soldiers in parts of occupied China in the 10 day period 
from February 1, 1938.

In Nanking region there were reportedly 141 women and 2,500 Japanese soldiers.

Detailing
 the full extent of the atrocities, China research centre on comfort 
women director Su Zhiliang said these figures equated to one woman being 
tortured 178 times in 10 days.

'The
 archives of Kwantung army unveiled this time and other times showed 
clearly that Japanese military and government implemented sex slavery in
 the army. The mechanism was influential and forcible. It was against 
the personal wills of these women. Second, it was widely adopted,' Su 
said.

Japan
 refuses to directly compensate surviving comfort women, stating all 
claims were settled by a bilateral treaty that normalised diplomatic 
ties in 1965.

In
 1995, a privately run Asian women's fund was set up, but because it 
relied on donations, many women refused to accept any compensation not 
paid by the Japanese governmernt and this resulted in the fund ceasing 
in 2007.

The
 military police corps was part of Japan's Kwantung army, which was the 
occupying force sustaining the Manchuria regime in Manchuria in the 
early 1930s.

Newspaper
 articles, letters from Japanese soldiers, military files discovered in 
the 1950s and kept at the Jilin provincial archives in north-east China 
as well as the regime's national bank documents are included in the 
archives.

The archive's director Yin Huai said the contents of the documents were shocking.

'Going
 through the bloodiest parts of these archives, many of us experts have 
succumbed to chronic depression,' he said, according to the official 
China News Service.

Zhao Sujian, 81, has been an archive employee since 1948 and said a People's Liberation Army unit discovered the documents in November 1953, while soldiers were digging close to remains of the Japanese bases where they were fixing electric cables and laying pipes.

Among the 89 documents, details of the Nanking massacre were also revealed

Emotive disputes linked to Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule over the Korean peninsula have left relations between Tokyo and Seoul at their lowest ebb for years.

The issue of comfort women, in particular, has contributed to a virtual freeze in diplomatic ties between the neighbours.

Historians say up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea but also from China, Indonesia, the Philippines and Taiwan, were forced to work in Japanese army brothels.

Japan has long maintained that all issues relating to the colonial period were settled under a 1965 bilateral treaty that normalised diplomatic ties with South Korea.

According to the government official cited by Kyodo, the offer of another apology and further compensation would be formalised only after confirming the issue 'has been completely settled' to ensure that South Korea never brings it up again.

Japan previously offered money to former sex slaves through the Asian Women's Fund, a private body set up at Tokyo's initiative in 1995 and run until 2007.

But some survivors refused the cash because it did not come directly from the government.Japanese politicians have expressed exasperation at Seoul's repeated requests for contrition.

Repeated wavering since the apology among senior right-wing politicians has contributed to a feeling in South Korea that Japan is in denial and not sufficiently remorseful.

There are 55 surviving former comfort women in South Korea.

He said 
the documents completely filled a truck, but because they had been 
buried for so long, many unusable because they rotted into a single mass
 or were stuck together.

The
 archive in Changchun, the provincial capital, analysed the documents in
 1982 after receiving them from a local law enforcement office.

Yet
 today, most of the documents remain untranslated, due to the poor 
quality of the material and also a lack of Japanese-speaking 
researchers.

While
 it was not clear why Jilin Provincial Archives released the 89 
documents on Friday, Chinese state media believes it could be a reaction
 to on-going claims by conservative politicians that the comfort women 
were not forced by the military or government officials.

Experts
 have said the archives provide important historical value because they 
contest the denial of war crimes by the Japanese right-wing.

The
 25 previously confidential files relating to sex slaves include 
telephone records, documents mentioning sexual enslavement of women and 
other reports, according to Chinese media.

A
 telephone record taken from the national bank of Manchuria in 1944 
shows the Japanese imperial army spent 532,000 yen on establishing what 
they called comfort stations, according to the Global Times.

Other records reveal how the Japanese army abducted women from the Korean peninsula.

Also
 revealed are details of the Nanking massacre, in which Japanese 
soldiers killed up to 300,000 people during their 1937 to 1938 
occupation of Nanking, now known as Nanjing, according to Chinese and 
western historians.

Japanese authorities also dispute this figure, while far-right commentators have gone as far to claim China fabricated the massacre.

Japan caused outrage in South Korea and China this year when it announced plans to re-examine a 1993 statement, where the government acknowledged for the first time the military's role in forcing women into sexual slavery.

At the time, the government's chief spokesman Yohei Kono, apologised for the women's suffering, but demands that the Diet (houses of representatives and councillors) vote to approve the statement, were not met.

Public figures close to Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe have also increased tensions between the country and South Korea by claiming Japan was unfairly singled out for criticism of its wartime conduct.

Abe has since confirmed he will not change the statement, which has been maintained by the following Japanese administrations since its issue more than 20 years ago by then chief cabinet secretary Yohei Kono.

The impact of the war on Japan's relationship with China and South Korea was further tested on Monday, when a member of Abe's cabinet visited the Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo.

The shrine honours the 2.5 million Japanese killed in the war, including 14 leaders who were convicted of class A war crimes by the allies.

Viewed by Beijing and Seoul as a symbol of Japanese militarism, the visit by Tomomi Inada, a state minister in charge of administrative reform, proceeded a visit just days earlier by almost 150 Japanese MPs.

Abe used Obama's visit to the Japanese capital last week to say the country regretted the pain it caused in the past, particularly in Asia.

The release of the documents comes after US president Barack Obama recently said the use of comfort women is a violation of human rights.

'Violation of human rights': US president Barack Obama has demanded Japan detail the full extent of sexual abuse of women at the hands of its military

While visiting Seoul at the weekend, Obama demanded Japan fully detail the sexual abuse of women at the hands of its military. He said: 'This was a terrible, egregious violation of human rights.'

'Those women were violated in ways that, even in the midst of war were shocking,' he said. 'They deserve to be heard. They deserve to be respected. And there should be an accurate and clear account of what happened.'

On Sunday, he went a step further when he told reporters the plight of the comfort women was 'heart-wrenching'.
