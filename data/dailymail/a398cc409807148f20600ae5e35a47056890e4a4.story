A female motorist survived a dramatic 40ft plunge into a construction pit after her car hit several other vehicles and ploughed through a wooden fence.

The woman was rescued by construction workers after her Toyota Highlander crashed through a plywood barrier in Brooklyn, New York, and fell front first into the pit below.

Witnesses said the driver had swerved to avoid a cyclist riding on the wrong side of the road, before hitting two vans and a parked car and careering through the barrier into the 40ft-deep construction area.

Lucky escape: Construction workers pulled the woman out of the car after the accident, before passers-by watched her car pulled from site

Amazingly she only sustained non life-threatening injuries after the plunge despite the car having its window smashed and hood and roof completely crumpled.

She even miracuously avoided hitting any construction workers below, who went on to haul her from the smashed vehicle.

Passers-by described the fact the woman was not majorly hurt as 'miraculous'.

Omar Porcayo, 21, who works at a nearby kosher supermarket, told the New York Times: 'The car turned over; it was a loud noise, and everyone turned to look.

'I ran over and saw two people. I saw construction workers pulling her out of the car. I was surprised they didnâ€™t get hit, too. Everyone was amazed.'

A spokesperon for the owners of the buildng site said it was not active at the time of the crash.

A Fire Department spokesperson said the women was rescued and taken to Kings County Hospital Center with injuries that were not life-threatening.
