Two people had to be rescued from their car after it became trapped in a flooded creek  in an incident that could be repeated across the country as the eastern states are hit with severe weather in the next week.

The passengers were trapped in their car for two hours when their vehicle was submerged in one metre of floodwater at the junction of Pejar Rd and Dawson's Creek in the small town of Crookwell, south-west of Sydney, last night.

They were freed at 8.20pm after a combined rescue effort from SES, ambulance paramedics police and NSW fire services and were taken to Crookwell Hospital suffering from exposure.

The incident comes as the Bureau of Meteorology has issued a severe weather warning for Sydney, as well as the Illawarra, South Coast and Hunter regions of New South Wales.

Strong winds are expected to hit Sydney later today and people are warned not to swim, surf or engage in rock fishing due to dangerous coastal conditions.

'Stay indoors, park your car undercover, tie down any possessions that could fly about,' a spokesperson for the State Emergency Services told Daily Mail Australia.

Winds of up to 100km/h have already hit areas south of Sydney near Wattamolla in the upper Kangaroo Valley, the Bureau of Meteorology said on Monday morning.

Up to 60mm rain is expected to fall over the Sydney CBD on Monday, while areas in the Illawarra region could received double that amount.

The NSW State Emergency Service has received 270 calls for help since the bad weather set in on Sunday, mostly for leaking and damaged roofs in the Sydney area.

The rain event started developing on Thursday in northwest NSW and southwest Queensland and spread through the east coast across the weekend.

Last night the Gold Coast experienced its wettest 24 hours for this time of year in 15 years, with some areas experiencing more than 100mm of rainfall.

'It's rare to see widespread rainfall over eastern Australia in August,' Mr Allen said.

The heavy rains are expected to ease by Tuesday, with scattered showers continuing through to the weekend.

It is expected that the change in weather will provide some relief to drought-stricken parts of Queensland and eastern Victoria.
