A horse left for dead in North Carolina has earned the name 'Hope' with her strong will to survive.

The two-year-old equine was found starved and with seeping wounds all over her body by animal rescue workers in December. Her hair was also matted with dirt and feces.

But after weeks of rehabilitation, Hope is back on four hooves and gradually gaining weight.

Skin and bones: Hope was found starved and with seeping wounds all over her body by animal rescue workers in December

State of distress: Her hair was also matted with dirt and feces - here workers stand her up using a sling 

'Against staggering odds, she is still alive and continues to improve daily,' the team at Sandhills Horse Rescue wrote on a Facebook page created to raise awareness of Hope's plight. 

'She has the heart of a warrior,' they added.

Hope was rescued from a farm along with another filly named Arya, who wasn't in such a bad condition.

In a bid to help her deeps cuts heel, the mare has started sleeping in a sling.

This allows her to rest standing instead of lying down in the hay, which aggravates her injuries.

Her raw skin has also been bandaged up to prevent infection and irritation.

To help her build strength, fat and calcium has been added to her diet.

Recent videos show that Hope is slowing getting back on track.

In one piece of footage she trots around her pen and in another clip she performs a trick in return for a treat.

She also cuts a fashionable stance in a zebra-print jacket, which was sent to her by a fan.

The team at Sandhills Horse Rescue conclude: 'When visitors come to see Hope, they also get to meet Arya and see that no matter what life throws you, you can overcome it!

Shocking story: Animal control officers are currently investigating the severe neglect case

'Hope does take the majority of the spotlight (which she definitely deserves) due to her dramatic situation, but there is a lot of healing going on here in more ways than one!'

Hope's progress will continue to be updated online. 

Donations are being accepted towards her treatment.

Animal control officers are currently investigating the severe neglect case. 

It will then be up to a District Attorney to bring criminal charges against Hope's former owner.
