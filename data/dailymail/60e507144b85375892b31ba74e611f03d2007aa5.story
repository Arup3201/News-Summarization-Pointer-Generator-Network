Reverend Al Sharpton is leading a wave of outcry after a report suggested that investigators do not have enough evidence to charge a police officer over the shooting of Michael Brown.

Details revealed by the New York Times included the first account of the shooting to come from Darren Wilson - who says he struggled with Brown in his squad car and shot the teen when he grabbed for his gun.

Experts told the paper that they believe investigators do not have the evidence to prosecute Wilson on federal civil rights charges - meaning a grand jury could soon decide Wilson should not be tried over the killing.

Anger: Rev Al Sharpton launched an enraged attack on Darren Wilson for claiming he acted in self-defense

'Same excuse': He likened the shooting to other slayings of black teenagers at the hands of white men

In his own version of events, the police officer told a grand jury he opened fire because the teenager was attacking him and he feared for his life. 

Wilson insists Brown viciously launched through the window of his police car, punching and scratching him repeatedly.

Police officers are generally given more scope for lethal force if they reasonably believe that their life is in imminent danger.

Eventually, Wilson said, he pulled his gun from the holster on his right hip, fired two shots, and one hit Brown's arm - leaving his blood smeared inside the car and on his uniform.

The account stops there and fails to explain why Brown was shot a further four times outside the vehicle. 

Since no other witness had a clear vantage point from which to see the incident, legal experts warn Wilson's testimony will carry significant weight for the grand jury, a legal expert told MailOnline. 

Slamming the account as illogical, Sharpton today raged at his weekly National Action Network rally in Harlem that it is the 'same excuse' as all other shootings of black citizens by white men.

'It sounds like a Michael Dunn defense,' he said, referring to the Florida man who has been convicted of first-degree murder for shooting dead black teenager Jordan Davis. Dunn claimed he did it because Davis was playing music too loudly.

'It didn't work in Florida and it shouldn't work in Missouri,' Sharpton added. 

He spluttered: 'First of all, if you stopped him - Michael Brown and his friend - walking down the street, what led to the scuffle?

Claims: Wilson, pictured again surveying the body, insists he fired from inside the car during a tussle but his account did not explain why the unarmed teenager was then shot at least four times outside the vehicle

'Secondly, how does he and you get in your car? You trying to do what by yourself?' Sharpton asked. 

'Now, if I go with you with your story all the way to that - that Michael Brown was shot, gets up off you in the car - why are you trying to tell me that a man ran back at you when he knew you had the gun and you already shot him?'

He added: 'We were involved in Trayvon Martin. We were supportive of Jordan Davis.

'The strange thing is that all of them used the same excuse...The only gun there was Darren Wilson's! Strange parallels with all of these cases.' 

His words were echoed by Mahatma Gandhi's grandson Dr Arun Gandhi who spoke today to condemn racism in St Louis as a source of the violence that has killed 110 people this year. 

He spoke to address hundreds of mothers gathered at a silent march outside St Louis County Justice Center today, where they held a four-minute silence for Michael Brown.

'We have looked at it only as racism, and racism is a byproduct of prejudice,' he said, St Louis Public Radio reported. 

'Prejudice exists in every one of us, whether we are black, white, brown, yellow.'  

Nonetheless, a jury will now have the power to tell the state attorney that Wilson is innocent of civil rights abuses if they believe his claim that he was acting in self-defense.

Peter Joy, a professor at the Washington University of Law in St Louis, told MailOnline the charge of civil rights abuse is a much higher standard than murder or manslaughter, as the 12 jury members will have to be certain Wilson intended to violate Brown's civil rights by shooting him dead.

'The civil rights abuses are even harder to prove than an underlying criminal conviction. The federal government does not step in to pursue a civil rights conviction unless they believe it was an intentional abuse.

'There are some criminal charges that don't involve that kind of mental state, like murder. 

'For example anger. They can be guilty of acting knowingly and recklessly, but it is different to intentionally violating a civil right.'

As a result, he said, they will need forensic evidence of damage to the car to disprove Wilson's account if they are to find him guilty. 

Duke University law professor James Coleman Jr told MailOnline an innocent verdict would 'totally undermine the St Louis criminal justice system'. 

'If a grand jury accepts that every shot he fired at that kid was in self-defense that simply is not plausible,' he said.

But he warned that prosecutor Robert McCulloch - who has been criticized for his strong ties with the police - will have a strong influence over their verdict.

'Pretty much every jury does what they are told.

'If the prosecutor is being wishy washy about this, it is very possible a grand jury won't indict him.' 

Determined to level charges against Wilson regardless of the jury's verdict, Benjamin L Crump, the Brown family's lawyer, rebuffed the leaked account.

'What the police say is not to be taken as gospel,' Mr. Crump told the New York Times.

'He can say what he wants to say in front of a jury. They can listen to all the evidence and the people can have it transparent so they know that the system works for everybody.

'The officer's going to say whatever he's going to say to justify killing an unarmed kid. 

'Right now, they have this secret proceeding where nobody knows what's happening and nobody knows what's going on. 

'No matter what happened in the car, Michael Brown ran away from him.'

A number of witnesses agree that Brown and Wilson were embroiled in a physical fight through the car window, but few had an accurate vantage point to see what was happening.

'Self defense': Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson says he feared for his life as he shot Michael Brown

They insist, however, the teenager was trying to flee and holding up his hands.

One passer-by, Tiffany Mitchell, is certain Brown was leaning away but Wilson kept pulling him closer.

Another, Dorian Johnson, said Wilson grasped Brown's throat and then pulled out his gun threatening to shoot. 

They then heard shots fired from inside the SUV. 

There remains no account from witnesses or police of the final four shots fired. 

Next week, Al Sharpton will hold a four-day Michael Brown tribute in Ferguson October 31 to November 4 in reference to the four hours that the teenager's body was left lying on the street.

According to Wilson's description of the August 9 shooting - revealed for the first time today - Brown made him fear for his life. 

Investigators are now examining the officer's claim that the teenager physically assaulted him as a grand jury considers whether he is guilty of a number of crimes including: first-degree murder, second-degree murder, voluntary manslaughter or involuntary manslaughter.

City officials claim there is still not enough evidence to charge Wilson with violating civil rights.

In September, Officer Wilson appeared  before a St Louis County grand jury, which was convened to determine whether there is probable cause that he committed a crime.

His willingness to testify surprised many. 

However, his account of feeling vulnerable will be a significant boost in his favor as the grand jury considers its verdict before the deadline of January 7. 

Nine of the 12 jury members will have to vote against Wilson in order for charges to be leveled.

They are expected to vote by mid-November. 

St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert P. McCulloch could have bypassed the grand jury stage and simply taken the case to trial by filing a charge against Wilson.

He could also have filed a complaint to a judge who decides if there should be a trial.

However, McCulloch chose to take the full investigation of Wilson's use of deadly force to the grand jury, leaving the 12 members to decide. 

According to the New York Times, the leaked account of his version of events did not come from the Ferguson Police Department or from officials whose activities are being investigated as part of the civil rights inquiry.

People claiming to have witnessed the shooting have given wildly different accounts of what happened. 

Some have said that some the young man had his arms raised over his head while others claim that Wilson shot him while his back was turned and he was running. 

The police have maintained that the unarmed teen physically assaulted the officer and tried to get his gun.

One witness, whose name has been withheld, from St. Louis, Missouri, told the grand jury that the teenager did not have his hands above his head when Wilson shot at him, but rather 'out to his sides.' 

He also said Brown 'staggered toward Wilson despite commands to stop' and that 'the two were about 20 to 25 feet apart when the last shots were fired.'  

Protests in Missouri have continued ever since the shooting amid claims it was unjustified - and an extreme example of police brutality in the town. 

Civil rights groups say Brown's death is part of a national epidemic in which a disproportionately high number of unarmed black men are fatally shot by white police officers, an allegation police deny.

Officials said that the evidence given so far did not support civil rights charges against Officer Wilson. 

To press charges, the Justice Department would have to prove that he wilfully violated Brown's rights when he shot him.
