This is the dramatic moment a self-styled 'paedophile hunter' confronted a potential sex attacker who he had lured to a house by posing as a child online. 

Vigilante Stinson Hunter, who is based in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, works with his team to entrap internet perverts - including soldiers, teachers and solicitors - by posing as underage boys and girls. 

In this dramatic clip,  undercover vigilantes from Hunter's team were seen poised for action with a camera while they waited for one of the suspects.

When the man walked in, one of the vigilantes asked the suspect to explain himself, before starting to click away with his camera in a bid to expose him.

In action: A clip from the documentary 'Paedophile Hunter' shows Stinson Hunter and his team confronting a suspected paedophile after they lured him to a house so they could ask him about his alleged crime 

Hunting down: In the dramatic footage, one man stood poised with his camera and waited for the man to enter in a bid to expose him 

But the man - who was not seen on camera - fled from the scene, sparking a sudden chase which was captured on a shaky, hand-held camera.

The two men shouted for him to stop, promising him the information would be handed to the police.

One of the men was then heard saying: 'Sir, I suggest you stop and talk, your information is going to be handed to the police'. 

The clip sets the tone for the remainder of the Paedophile Hunter, a one-hour film to be shown tomorrow night on Channel 4.

It follows the 31-year-old and his team as they track down suspects through the internet and dating apps.

Hunter told the documentary each of the team has a 'defined role'. Grime, who features heavily in the documentary, is the 'tech guy', responsible for ensuring the videos are filmed and edited properly.

But the man - who was not seen on camera - ran from the property when he realised he could be exposed

The vigilantes usually pose as boys or girls in their early teens. Once they are sent explicit messages and videos by the men, the team lure them to a house to meet up. 

There, they are filmed with handheld cameras and mobile phones and told to explain themselves. The messages and footage are handed to police.

So far, Hunter has filmed confrontations with dozens of men including soldiers, teachers and solicitors and seen his evidence help in 10 convictions. 

During the documentary, the team was also filmed setting up a trap to catch the suspected offender. One of the team was filmed following a black taxi, while speaking on the phone to two of his colleagues.

Meanwhile, those two vigilantes were filmed nervously peering through the blinds while they waited for the arrival of a taxi at a nearby home.

When one shouted 'Taxi's here', the pair - one equipped with a camera - put themselves into position and waited to confront the man when he arrived at the front door.

Hunter's methods have been both praised and criticised. Stinson's methods came under fire last year after one man who he confronted, 45-year-old Michael Parkes, took his own life. 

Jim Gamble (pictured) said online vigilantes were 'shooting fish in a barrel' by using covert stings

But Jim Gamble, the former head of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (Ceop), said the former drug addict provided a lesson in how people could trap paedophiles with 'very little training'.

He said: 'Some people with very little training are proving just how easy it is to go out there and catch individuals.

'They are able to go online with little or no training and very quickly they’re shooting fish in a barrel.

'The fact of the matter is this, that needs to be done by law enforcement and whilst I don’t see any justification in reality for vigilantes doing what they do I think it provides the evidence for the Government, if it’s needed, that actually this works.'  

He added he understood the 'frustration' that drove the self-styled investigative journalist, who lives in the Coventry area and says he witnessed abuse as a child, to target suspected predators.

But Mr Gamble insisted the vigilante's actions created 'a risk' to himself and other people, and were not the most appropriate way forward. 

But there have been controversies, particularly in the case of Mr Parkes.

The 45-year-old hanged himself last year after being questioned by police after he was confronted by Stinson Hunter, and footage of the encounter was uploaded to the internet.

Northamptonshire Police later said they would have sought to charge Mr Parkes in connection with the incident, in which he arranged to meet someone he thought was a 12-year-old girl.

Mr Parkes’ partner, who was also interviewed for the Channel 4 documentary, said she 'may agree' with the vigilante going online to gather evidence, but said publishing the videos was 'what probably tipped him over the edge'. 

Stinson Hunter had insisted on keeping his face secret for fear of reprisals, but went public after saying he had 'always wanted to be on Channel 4'.

Controversial: Self-styled paedophile catchers like Stinson Hunter (pictured) show police should invest more in online stings, according to Britain's former child protection chief Jim Gamble

He told the film's Bafta-winning director Dan Reed: 'We set the profile. It’s like a rope and if they choose to put the rope around their neck and hang themselves that’s their choice.

'We’ve not pushed them.' 

The film also features interviews with police and legal experts who tackle child exploitation, who talk about the dangers for vigilantes, the people they target and their families.

There is also the risk that amateur investigations could compromise police probes, the experts say.

One barrister who regularly deals with child exploitation cases, Hugh Davies QC, added there were risks of copycat vigilantes springing up in response.

The Paedophile Hunter will be screened on Wednesday, October 1 at 10pm on Channel 4.
