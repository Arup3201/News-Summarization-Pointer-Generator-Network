Saturday Night Live got a visit from a very special guest star during their holiday episode.

Former cast member Mike Myers returned to the show for the cold open, and revisited one of his greatest characters of all time - Dr. Evil.

Keeping things topical, Dr. Evil offered his perspective on the recent Sony hack, saying how 'pathetic' it was to see Sony and North Korea 'fight over a stupid comedy.'

He then adds, 'Why pick on Sony? They haven't had a hit since the Walkman.'

Pathetic: Meyers as Dr. Evil labeled Kim Jong-un as 'pathetic' for getting angry over a 'silly comedy'

'It's like watching two bald men fight over a comb,' the follicularly challenged villain then added. 

The comedy her was referring to was The Interview, the James Franco and Seth Rogen film about the assassination of Kim Jong-un that the studio has decided not to release. 

Then, after noting how close he was to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un following a recent Viking River cruise the two men took together, he took aim at the name of the hacking group - Guardians of Peace.

'There's already a G.O.P.,' said Dr. Evil, referring to the Grand Old Party.

'And thy're already an evil organization.'

Having a laugh: Myers also took some time to acknowledge one of his box office failures, The Love Guru

Myers then took a moment to poke fun at himself at the end of the skit, saying; 'If you really want to put a bomb in a theater, do what I did - put in The Love Guru.'

This is a reference to the actor's 2008 box office flop.

Myers was not the only former cast member to stop be either, with Kristen Wiig joining Amy Adams during her opening monologue.
