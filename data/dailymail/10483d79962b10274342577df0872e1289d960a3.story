With December 21 - or 'the end of the world' as it is being referred to in some camps - fast approaching, Doomsday 'preppers' are putting the final touches to bunkers where they will ride out the Apocalypse.

The Mayan calendar has predicted that in just 
38 days the world will end - but fear not, if you have so far been unprepared.

Bunkers have already been built around the world to withstand impending doom and despite some rather shabby and gloomy interiors, they may soon be in high demand if predictions ring true.

America is dotted with bunkers - several working and others long out of use and turned into quirky museums and hotels. 

At the height of nuclear tensions with Cuba and the Soviets in the early Sixties, JFK built a bunker on Peanut Island, across from his family's Florida compound. It has now been turned into a museum. 

More luxurious options are also available. The Hilton Hotel in the Maldives offers underwater suites, with a view of marine life and where guests can wait out the apocalypse in the lap of luxury with a large comfortable bed and complimentary fruit baskets.

In Sweden, the bunker deep in the 
middle of a mountain, where Wikileaks stores its servers, also doubles 
as a secure spot to wait out an apocalypse - getting invited in is the 
only problem.

The Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler shelter was 
tunneled out beneath vineyards in western Germany as a hideout for the 
government in the event of a nuclear war.

In
the Adirondack Mountains, just a few hours drive from New York City, is
a former Cold War missile base with its own runway set on 19 acres of 
land.

The Mayan tribes of South America are
believed by some to have been privy to impending disasters that 
coincide with 2012, ranging from explosive storms on the surface of the 
sun that could knock out power grids to a galactic alignment that could 
trigger a reversal in Earth's magnetic field.

Experts met in September to quell fears that the end of the world is nigh and Mayan prophecies have been misinterpreted. 

Archaeologists and anthropologists 
gathered in the southern Mexico city of Merida to discuss the 
implications of the calendar, which is made up of 394-year periods 
called baktuns, and had named the end date as December 21.
