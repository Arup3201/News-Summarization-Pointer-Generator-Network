A stomach-filling ‘anti-hunger’ additive is being used to make yoghurts and smoothies that help dieters lose weight by making them feel full after eating small amounts.

Scientists are developing the ingredient, SATISFIT-LTG, as a slimming aid.

Dr Carsten Huettermann, from German firm Dow Wolff, told the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia that tests found volunteers felt full after eating smaller amounts of food containing the substance.

Diet of the future: A stomach-filling 'anti-hunger' additive is being used to help dieters lose weight by making them feel full after eating small amounts

Volunteers who ate food containing the additive consumed 13 per cent fewer calories when given a second meal two hours later.

The additive is a new version of a substance called methyl cellulose, which is used as a binding agent in snacks such as ready meals and baked goods.

A white power, which dissolves in hot water it turns into a gel when it is heated and has been in use for 50 years, almost gluing ingredients together in food.

It could be used in a variety of cold foods including yogurts

Conventional versions of methyl 
cellulose pass through the stomach too rapidly to have an impact on 
satiety, said Dr Huettermann. But the new additive forms a gel at body 
temperature which lingers in the stomach before passing into the small 
intestine.

Dr Carsten Huettermann, from Dow Wollf Cellulosics in Bomlitz, Germany, told the American Chemical Society's annual meeting in Philadelphia: 'This ingredient would make people feel full after eating smaller amounts of food.

'With that sense of fullness and hunger-satisfaction, they would not crave more food.

'In our first study, we saw that fewer calories were consumed at the following meal after eating our new product. Our next step now is to investigate in further studies the mechanism of action and whether this may have an impact on weight management.

SATISFIT-LTG is being developed as a potential ingredient in chilled products such as smoothies and yoghurts, Dr Huettermann added.

Emma Williams, a member of the Nutrition Society, told The Daily Telegraph: 'Although these findings are interesting because this is a proof-of-concept study much more research is needed to understand the processes as well as the implications for long-term weight reduction.

Dr Huettermann said further research was being done after the promising clinical trials.
