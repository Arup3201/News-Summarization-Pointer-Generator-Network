Police believe the fire which killed a family of four as it ripped through
 the Florida mansion of former tennis player James Blake was part of a 
murder suicide.

Debbie 
Carter, spokesperson for Hillsborough County Sheriff's Department, 
confirmed that authorities are not looking for a suspect in the blaze, which claimed the lives of Darrin Campbell, 49, his wife 
Kimberly, 51, and their teenage children Colin, 19, and Megan, 16.

She
 also revealed that authorities did not received any 911 calls before 
the fire was reported by a member of the public at 5.45am and two of the
 victims appeared to have 'upper-body trauma', but did not say which 
members.

'I was walking my 
dogs, and I walked by the house and it exploded!' the caller told the 
dispatcher according to the New York Daily News.

Describing
 the scene inside the burnt-out mansion as 'unusual' firefighters said 
they discovered fireworks littered through the five-bedroom home rented 
from former tennis player Blake, who was ranked fourth in the world in 
2006.

Authorities said that
 the two teenagers were found in their bedrooms and that the two adults 
were found in their bedroom and that an accelerant was found across the 
mansion.

Blake's
 next door neighbor reportedly told TMZ Sports that he heard several 
large explosion in early this morning and saw an 'instant fireball 
inferno' when he went outside to check it out.

He said the sound seemed to be coming from the garage of Blake's house.

They
 added that detectives may not be able to even enter the remains of the 
home until Thursday, due to structural damage. This will delay the official 
identification of the victims.

Once it is safe to enter, investigators will likely be on site for days gathering evidence.

Blake purchased the home in Avila for $1.5 million in 2005, according to Hillsborough County property records.

Neighbours told detectives that Blake hasn't lived in the house for a while and was renting it out.

Detectives haven't talked with Blake, whose agent said he was certain the former star was not in Florida.

Avila is an exclusive enclave north of Tampa known for its mansions and heavy security.
