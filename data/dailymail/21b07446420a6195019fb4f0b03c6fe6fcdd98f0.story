Gordon Strachan has admitted that even his players have no idea who will captain Scotland against Georgia. 

Fit-again Scott Brown is vying with long-term squad skipper Darren Fletcher for the honour of leading the team out for this evening’s Euro 2016 qualifier at Ibrox.

Sportsmail understands David Marshall has won the race with Craig Gordon to be Strachan’s No1, but the manager will keep his senior midfield duo waiting until the team announcement on Saturday morning before handing out the armband.

Fletcher has captained the country 23 times since taking the armband from Barry Ferguson in 2009. But Celtic skipper Brown deputised during the Manchester United midfielder’s lengthy illness. And that leaves Strachan to break the news of his final decision to both players this morning.

‘The captain doesn’t know yet,’ said the Scotland boss. ‘The captain doesn’t know it’s him.

‘But when the team is announced in the morning we will announce the captain at the same time.

‘Remember, James Morrison has been captain as well. There are boys who have been captain who have done a smashing job and we have good leaders here.’

The decision could hinge on whether Fletcher plays from the start. His last first-team appearance under Louis van Gaal was a home win over West Ham on September 27.

Strachan said he has no issue with playing key lieutenants who are out of their club team, as he proved before with Alan Hutton, and insisted the matter will have no bearing on who he selects for his starting 11 or for captain.

‘It’s not a problem,’ he added. ‘You never know when the right time is to tell people they are captain or that they are dropped.

‘It’s a thing, a debate, which has been going on since I’ve been in fitba.

‘When is the right time to tell a player? If you tell them too early they are disappointed. Do you tell them later?

‘You have to get it right and different people take it different ways.

‘I remember a boy Richard Shaw at Coventry. Every time I dropped him he wouldn’t speak to me for a week. Just wouldn’t speak to me. We’re the best of mates now. But back then he didn’t want to speak to me.’

Asked if the identity of the Scotland captain really mattered, Strachan insisted: ‘Does it matter to the group? I don’t think so.

‘I think we have people in the group — James as well — who could captain the side.

‘I don’t think it would make any difference to the rest of the group because they feel comfortable with these lads.

‘I played for Scotland as captain and not as captain. I was more than happy. It was not a problem. It’s just about how you deal with it yourself.

‘I was left out for over a year with Scotland under Andy Roxburgh, I then came back and ended up being captain. Andy is one of my best mates in football. I was fine, I just looked at myself and thought: “I’m not playing very well.” I could understand it.’

Celtic captain Brown missed the opening qualifying defeat to Germany through injury, but admitted he would love to reclaim the role he held in Fletcher’s absence.

‘I don’t know if I’m captain yet,’ said Brown. ‘We find that out tomorrow. It’s up to the manager.

‘I’ve got to be honest, the captaincy means a lot to whoever does get the honour.

‘Myself, Darren has been captain in the past, Gary Caldwell, Kenny Miller … if you ask any of us, it’s a proud moment.

‘But so is playing for your country, so is winning with your country, getting to a major finals.

‘That’s what we all want. It’s not about fighting over a captaincy – it’s about joining together and being more of a team than ever.’
