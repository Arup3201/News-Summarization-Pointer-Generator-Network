North Korea has threatened a fresh atom bomb test in response to a UN resolution on its human rights violations.

New satellite imagery reportedly shows steam rising from the North's Yongbyon plutonium reprocessing complex, a sign experts say consistent with it gearing up to resume operations.

Pyongyang's foreign ministry today called the UN's new resolution 'a grave political provocation', and accused the U.S. of orchestrating the measures drafted by Japanese and EU diplomats.

The resolution, adopted by a UN committee on Tuesday, urges the Security Council to refer the North's rights situation to the International Criminal Court.

It's the first time a UN resolution included the idea that the North's absolute leader Kim Jong Un could be targeted by prosecutors.

Before the UN vote, a North Korean envoy threatened a nuclear test and today that threat was repeated by an unidentified foreign ministry spokesman in North Korean state media.

He said war deterrence will be strengthened in an 'unlimited manner' to cope with U.S. hostility, which is 'compelling us not to refrain from conducting a new nuclear test any longer.'

The U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies said Wednesday the North may be restarting a plant that can reprocess nuclear fuel into weapons-grade plutonium for the first time in six years.

The finding is based on analysis of recent commercial satellite imagery at the North's main nuclear facility.

North Korea conducted an atomic bomb test in 2006, 2009 and 2013, each time inviting international sanctions.

A fourth test would mark another defiant response to international pressure, because that could put the country a step closer to the goal of producing warheads small enough to mount on a missile.

Today Russia shrugged off the reports of North Korea gearing up for fresh nuclear tests.

'Right now a lot of statements are appearing that some preparations are underway for new tests or the resumption or ramping up of activity in the nuclear and rocket spheres,' said Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.

'First of all, it is best to put forward such statements when they are based on facts -- not through the media,' Lavrov told reporters after talks with a special envoy of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un.

'This is why we propose that the activities of a working group on peace and security on the Korean peninsula be resumed,' Lavrov said after talks with Choe Ryong-Hae.

Such work, Russia's top diplomat said, would allow the parties to address all concerns 'without politicisation.'

'We are hoping that our partners will support our proposals to resume the work of the group.'

Choe did not address the media.

Russia, the U.S., China, South Korea and Japan have for years sought to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear programme in exchange for aid and security guarantees.

The negotiations known as six-party talks began in 2003 but have been long dormant.

Lavrov slammed as 'counter-productive' the UN resolution that lays the groundwork for putting the Stalinist regime in the dock for crimes against humanity.

Choe, who is on a week-long visit to Russia, was received by President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin on Tuesday.
