Lindsay Lohan checked into the Betty Ford Center rehab facility on Thursday night, narrowly avoiding an arrest warrant after failing to enter her court-approved facility earlier that day.

Her entry into the Rancho Mirage, California clinic comes after she is said to have rehired her previous lawyer Shawn Holley, who negotiated with Santa Monica City Attorney Terry White to approve the Betty Ford Center as an acceptable rehab alternative.

Lohan was scheduled to start rehab on Thursday morning to begin her 90 days of court-ordered treatment.

Finally checked in: Lindsay Lohan entered the Betty Ford Center rehab facility on Thursday night after rehiring former lawyer Shawn Holley in desperate bid to avoid arrest

Acceptable: The facility in Rancho Mirage, California was deemed 'acceptable' by the court late Thursday night

But the troubled starlet was reported to
been 'spooked' by the amount of paparazzi waiting outside the 
Morningside Recovery in Newport Beach, and refused to check into the 
facility.

Lohan was said to have then 'begged' Holley to return as her lawyer after prosecutors said they would seek an arrest warrant if the star was not back in rehab by sunrise on Friday, reported TMZ.

Lohan was allegedly unimpressed with the way lawyer Mark Heller
had handled her case, and spent the better part of Thursday convincing 
Holley to return after she sensationally fired her last year.

'Lindsay cannot stand [Heller] and thinks he doesn’t know what he is doing,' a source told RadarOnline.com. 'So late Thursday, from hiding, she began calling and emailing Shawn incessantly.

Mixing things up: Lindsay is reportedly unhappy 
with her lawyer Mark Heller's progress with the case, and has hired back
her former lawyer Shawn Holley

'Shawn has always had a soft spot for 
Lindsay, even after everything she has pulled. She hates to see her 
suffering,' added the source.

Holley was able to broker a last 
minute deal with the D.A. to approve the Betty Ford Center, where 
Lindsay famously fought with staffer during another rehab stay in 2010.

Lindsay's father Michael confirmed that she had finally entered a facility, although he didn't confirm which one.

Santa Monica Chief Deputy City Attorney Terry White said he has received confirmation that Lohan has checked in to a rehab facility and he is satisfied with her location.

Russ Patrick, a spokesman for Betty Ford, said he could not confirm Lohan had returned to the facility, which is a licensed treatment hospital founded in 1982 and has treated numerous celebrities.

Familiar surrounds: Lindsay spent time at Betty Ford in 2010, where she famously got into a fight with a staffer 

Not bad: The center features a sparkling blue pool where patients can take daily water aerobics classes

Comfortable: A typical room is set up for double occupancy and includes a private patio

Health is paramount: Patients choose from two hot entrees, a variety of deli sandwiches, along with a soup du jour and salad bar, according to the center's website

'I can’t say where she is. She did check into a rehab. I’m really happy she’s in a rehab,' Michael told The New York Post on Friday.

He said Lindsay sent him a text message on Thursday night to say she was in rehab, but that she would rather be at a more upmarket facility.

'Yes, daddy I’m OK, just annoyed by this happening,' he said she wrote. 'I really want to go to treatment and, of course, something has to go wrong...I want to go to Hawaii or Antigua.'

In contact: Lindsay's father Michael said she texted him saying she would rather be in a facility in Hawaii

The news comes after the star decided not to enter her court-ordered rehab treatment on Thursday morning.

'She felt Morningside was not suitable for her,' a source told Us Weekly about Lindsay's decision to leave. 'There were too many paparazzi everywhere and she didn't feel safe.

Lindsay's
SUV arrived at the California facility but the vehicle left with Lindsay still inside, according to TMZ.

Could face arrest: Lindsay’s failure to check in to the facility is likely a violation of her recent plea deal

RadarOnline, however, reports that Lohan did in fact walk through the doors of the facility, but left just a few minutes later.

'She told people there that she didn't need rehab,' a source told Radar. 'And then she left. Everyone was stunned.'

Lohan's father Michael also confirmed to Radar that his daughter never checked in.

'I have no other choice than to get this out there to help Lindsay,' he said.

Backing out: An image has been released which appears to show Lindsay and her luggage arriving at the facility

Retail therapy: At 8.45am, 15 minutes after she was due to check into her rehab facility, Lindsay was seen shopping at Fry's electronics store

Lindsay was spotted at a Fry's Electronics store 
in Fountain Valley at 8.45am, while at the same time her Heller was in court asserting she had already checked into rehab.

After refusing to check into 
Morningside, Lindsay allegedly insisted on being taken back to the 
airport because she wanted to fly to New York.

'She was saying, "I'm not going to rehab. I'm not going to rehab. Take me back to the airport,"' a source told The New York Daily News.

Orange County's finest: Police were seen surrounding Morningside as Lindsay checked in

'If
there’s credible confirmation she’s heading back to New York, then I’m 
going to have to go in and ask the court to issue a warrant,” Santa 
Monica City Attorney Terry White said on Thursday.

And the actress' father Michael told Radar: 'If
that’s the case I have been told that she will be arrested in New York 
and her bail will be set at $100,000.'

Michael also told the Daily News that
he had spoken to Lindsay before the flight to New York took off, 
pleading with her not to get on it.

'She said, "Daddy, how can they arrest me?" I got her just before she left,' said Michael.

Staying put: The Liz & Dick star will stay in the California facility until a decision has been made by the court

Final moments of freedom: On Wednesday Lindsay spent her last day before rehab shopping and chain-smoking

As well as telling the judge that 
Lindsay had already checked into rehab, Heller also had to plead with 
the judge to get the okay that Morningside would be a suitable facility 
for the actress to complete her treatment in.

Lindsay had originally been scheduled
to complete her 90-day treatment at the Seafield rehabilitation 
facility in New York after pleading no contest to charges of lying to police about driving 
during a car crash last June, but Michael appeared to have put the actress off 
the rehab centre.

'I
told her it’s like a motel, and you share a room and have a plastic 
shower curtain. You can’t smoke, you can’t leave the property. She said,
“What?!’” he told The New York Daily News.

Revoked: The Newport Beach rehab centre allegedly can only act as a sober living facility and treat outpatients

Going to a different centre unapproved by the court technically broke her plea agreement, meaning the 
star’s attorney was required to appear before a judge.

On Thursday morning, Heller was attempting to convince Judge James R Dabney 
to approve of the switch.

He argued that as Lindsay has already
entered and is ‘ensconced’ in the program, it could affect her recovery should she have to move facilities.

In and out: Lindsay allegedly left the plush rehab facility after 'a few minutes'

‘She's
going to be meeting with a psychiatrist later today,’ Heller explained, 
reinforcing that the star is ‘commencing immediate treatment.'

The
news came amid claims that the centre in fact does not even have a 
licence to offer residential treatment as it was revoked in May 2012.

According
to TMZ, Morningside had their licence suspended after they were found 
to be careless with prescription drugs and went beyond the constraints 
of the licence.

Looking out for Lindsay: Mark told Judge James R. Dabney that it would be a bad idea to move his client already

But
Morningside Recovery released a statement on Thursday claiming the 
facility does in fact have a licence to provide drug and alcohol 
treatment.

The facility's 
CEO Mary Helen Beatificato said the 2011 revocation of Morningside's 
licence only hinders the centre's ability to provide detox services to 
residents.

The
judge however didn’t seem to have too many qualms about the switch to 
that particular facility, despite the fact that it was not on a list
of six centres approved by the court.

Convincing: Lindsay chose a rehab centre which was not approved by the court so Mark was attempting to get the judge to OK the decision

Fighting his corner: The switch to a different rehab technically violates Lindsay's plea agreement and now the centre must be approved

'90 days and 270 looks': Lindsay posted a picture of herself packing for her stay in rehab on Instagram on Tuesday night

The judge later stated that Lindsay will not have to appear in court as the case continues 'as long as she is in compliance'.

In
addition, none of the star's progress reports are to be released to the
public aside from 'proof of completion' at the end of her stay.
