A Rastafarian student has been given an 'unlimited suspension' from school because he has dreadlocks.

The teenage boy has been banned from attending South Plaquemines High School, Louisiana, until he cuts off his long dreads, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in the area says.

The boy's mother and ACLU Louisiana say the dreads are a religious symbol and he cannot give them the chop.

Rastafarians see Haile Selassie I, who was Emperor of Ethiopia from 1930 to 1974, as their Messiah

The boy was sent home on the first day after classes resumed and has missed 10 days of school so far.

He went back to school the following week with his hair pinned up but was sent home immediately. 

The school's policy on boys' hair says it 'may not extend lower than the top of a school shirt collar. Boys' hair may not be pinned up, pulled back, or put in a pony tail'.

A letter from ACLU say it violates the student's constitutional rights, the Huffington Post reported.

'The wearing of dreadlocks for [the student] is akin to the wearing of a religious icon by another student,' it says.

'In discriminating against [the student's] religious beliefs, the school is expressing a preference for certain religions, which is unacceptable.

'The school's actions of prohibiting [the student] from attending school until he cuts his hair violates the Louisiana and United States Constitutions.

'We would object if the school were to tell a Christian student they could not wear a cross or if it were to permit the wearing of religious icons of one faith and prohibited those of another faith.

The Ethiopian flag carried the Lion of Judah from 1897 until Selassie was deposed in 1974. Rastafarians see their dreadlocks as symbolic of the lion's mane

'In discriminating against [the student's] religious beliefs, the school is expressing a preference for certain religions, which is unacceptable.'

'The actions of the school ... are the equivalent of an unlimited suspension.' 

Rastafarians believe the Bible forbids them from cutting their hair, and dreadlocks are a key part of their religious beliefs.

The Book of Leviticus says at 21:5: 'They shall not make baldness upon their head.'

Rastafarians therefore interpret this as meaning that growing their hair long is spiritual.

Rastafarians coil their hair into dreads particularly because they see them as symbolic of the mane of the Lion of Judah - seen on the Ethiopian flag until 1975. 

The student's mother gave a letter to the school from his church to show that he is a Rastafarian, but this was rejected.

School principal John Barthelemy said that the student was sent home but that he is not officially suspended.

He said: 'For the record, this particular student, I have him graduating early, we're trying to help him get out of school early.

'The days out of school were not counting against him for suspension or anything on his record, we want to get him back on track.'

Mr Barthelemy added that the boy had cut his hair last year, but the ACLU said that his family were not aware of his rights at the time.

The civil rights group are now seeking a formal hearing to ask for a dress code exemption for the pupil so he can go back to school.

In 2000, a different Rastafarian family in Louisiana were give an exemption to their school dress code, allowing children to wear coverings over their hair that matched school uniform.
