A five-year-old boy was tonight ‘fighting for his life’ after an accident on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland Paris.

The child from Montpellier is in a critical condition at Necker Hospital in Paris after ‘falling under a machine’ at the end of the ride at 4.50pm local time (3.50pm GMT) today, local media said.

Emergency services were called when the unidentified boy became ‘trapped between a platform and a boat’. The child had lost his balance and fallen overboard, reported the Europe 1 radio network.

He then became stuck under the boat behind the one carrying him, before his father jumped into the water and managed to free him. A Disneyland spokesman has confirmed the accident happened.

He told AFP: ‘The incident took place in late afternoon. Our first aid services quickly intervened to provide him first aid. The attraction is temporarily closed and we stand with the family.’

A spokesman for Disneyland has not yet returned a request for comment by MailOnline.

The flume-based ride, which inspired 
the hit films, was opened in 1992 at the Paris park and lasts for around 10
 minutes. The original ride was built in 1967 at Disneyland in Anaheim, 
California.

A 
description for the ride on the Disneyland Paris website says: 'Climb 
aboard the attraction that inspired the swashbuckling series of films.

Disneyland Paris: Construction started on the 5,000-acre site in 1988 and it opened to the public in 1992

'Cruise
 secret caverns and catch the Pirates Of The Caribbean in action as they
 loot, plunder and pillage. Will you escape with a souvenir snapshot to 
treasure?'

Construction started on the 5,000-acre
 site in 1988 and it opened to the public in 1992, well over budget. 
Visitor numbers were lower than hoped for and the hotels fell below 
their targets.

Two years 
after it opened, headlines asked if it was heading for 
bankruptcy. But in 1994, banks agreed to restructure the project's 
debts. By the end of 1994, the park had turned a corner.

New rides such as Space Mountain were opened in 1995 and a second park - the Walt Disney Studios Park - opened to mark its 10th birthday. Now it has celebrated its 20th anniversary.

However, it was revealed in April 2012 that the park owed a staggering £1.6billion - and it would take at least 12 years to pay off the debt.

Last month a 5,000-strong petition was launched against the park, claiming it was 'falling apart', amid complaints about reheated food, broken rides and cancelled stage shows. Disney did not comment.
