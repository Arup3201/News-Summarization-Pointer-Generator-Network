Without his well-groomed quiff, Elvis Presley may not have become 'The King'.

Female fans around the world would scream when they saw the singer's stylish pomp.

Now the singer's followers can own a single strand as it is being put up for auction, but they may have to spend as much as £500.

Authentic: A single strand of The King's hair, set in the middle of this gold record, will go on sale in Northumberland tomorrow

Rare item: Jim Railton says there is no estimate on the rare item, but claims it could sell from anywhere between £50 and £5000

Display: The tiny strand is mounted in the middle of a disc below a black-and-white picture of The King

The single piece of the world-renowned quiff, which is set in the middle of a framed golden record, will go under the hammer in Wooler, Northumberland tomorrow.

It
 has come from the collection of a late Elvis fan who lived in Gosforth,
 Newcastle.

Auctioneer Jim Railton has not placed an estimate on the item, saying: 'It will make whatever it makes. It could sell for £50 or £500.'

In the back of the picture frame is what purports to be a signed and witnessed document in the name of Thomas Morgan, who claims he knew Elvis.

The document says that Mr Morgan was a close friend of the singer's hair stylist, Homer Gilleland.

The letter describes how Mr Gilleland, who died in 1995, worked at Goldsmith's department store in Memphis, Tennessee, where Elvis lived.

Members of Elvis' family were among his customers and he got to know the musician, who eventually appointed him.

The King: A witness document signed by a man who is said to have known Elvis and his hair stylist Homer Gilleand could prove the item is real

Relationship: The letter from Thomas B. Morgan Jr saying the singer gave his stylist a number of presents, including a 1972 Lincoln Mark IV, before he died in 1977

It also states that Mr Gilleland accompanied the singer on various tours and

'One of his prize possessions was a bag of hair clippings that he had saved over many years when cutting and styling Elvis's hair,' Mr Morgan added.

'He ascertained that this bag of clippings were personally saved by him.'

Mr Railton said: 'The one thing I have certainly never sold before is a strand of Elvis's hair. There are a lot of Elvis fans out there.'

At first Mr Railton was suspicious of how genuine the item was, but claims the documents suggest it could be the real thing.

Signed: The correspondence states 'I do solemnly swear and attest that the hair clippings are actually from Elvis Aron Presley'
