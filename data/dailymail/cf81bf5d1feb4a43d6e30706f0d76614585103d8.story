Siblings of the man murdered by Jodi Arias tearfully told a jury on Thursday how they are still haunted by his killing six years ago, recounting a litany of nightmares, stomach ulcers and depression brought on by the loss of their beloved family member.

The family members gave their emotional impact statements to the Phoenix jury that is deciding whether the 34-year-old Arias should get the death penalty or a life sentence in the 2008 killing of Travis Alexander.

He was shot and stabbed in his shower by Arias in what prosecutors described as a jealous rage after he wanted to break off their relationship and see other people. Arias says it was self-defense.

Judge Sherry Stephens ruled that the courtroom must be cleared of everyone except for the victims and defendants' families for the victim impact statements

Steven Alexander described nightmares, ulcers and constant trauma from losing his brother, including locking the doors when he showers. He even said he suffers nightmares in which Jodi Arias slits his throat.

Alexander's brother and sister each spoke for 15 minutes and gave prepared speeches.

Tanisha Sorenson said that she and her family have been through agony in the days since her brother's death.

She described the depression she slipped into and called him her 'best friend.'

Tanisha called it a 'living hell' and revealed to the court she can still see her brother's decomposing body that she saw in court pics - especially the image of Alexander's dead body slumped over in the shower.'

'When I lay down at night, all I can think about is my brother's murder,' Steven Alexander said as other family members could be heard crying in the gallery.

A jury last year convicted Arias of murder but deadlocked on whether she should be sentenced to life in prison or death. 

A new jury was seated to decide the punishment again. The defense is expected to begin its case later Thursday.

The family statements came after several days of prosecution testimony, primarily by the Mesa detective who investigated the case and interrogated Arias.

Jurors also saw gruesome crime-scene photos and heard an X-rated phone call between Arias and the victim in the weeks before the killing.

Much of the testimony and evidence was a repeat from the original trial, which attracted a global following as it was televised live. The retrial is not being broadcast live, however.

The retrial opened a week ago with prosecutors telling jurors the Arizona murderer deserves the harshest sentence of them all.

'The only just punishment in this case is death,' Juan Martinez told the Maricopa County Superior Court.

Arias had her hair cut to shoulder-length for her return to the courtroom and appeared to have it dyed darker.

She has also been wearing a new pair of nude-framed glasses - perhaps because earlier this month, a Phoenix food bank auctioned off the glasses she wore at the original trial and raised close to $1,000 for charity.

Last week defense lawyer Kirk Nurmi began opening statements, telling jurors it was up to them to write the final chapter to the story.

The jury had been warned that it would see graphic evidence about the killing and relationship between Arias and victim Travis Alexander - but he said she should not be executed because she is mentally ill.

Prosecutor Martinez proved his point by showing jurors a picture of Arias' victim, ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander, with his throat slit.

'This is how much she loved him,' Martinez told the jury, according to ABC.

The victims' siblings were in court today along with Arias' parents and brother.

Arias was convicted of murder last year but the first jury was deadlocked on whether to give her the death penalty or life in prison.

That required a new jury and trial to decide her punishment.

Jodi Arias was found guilty of the murder of Travis Alexander in 2008 after slitting his throat so deeply she nearly decapitated him and shooting him in the forehead

A new jury that was picked over the past several weeks will listen as the former waitress tries to make another case that her life should be spared.

Four hundred people were called as prospective jurors. Many of them were cut after they said they either made up their minds about the case or knew too much to be impartial. Some jurors cited their objection to the death penalty.

They won't consider whether or not she's guilty - that's already been decided.

The retrial is expected to last into December.

Left for days: Alexander was left in this shower, for around five days before friends found his decaying body

Arias stabbed and slashed Alexander nearly 30 times, slit his throat so deeply she nearly decapitated him and shot him in the forehead.

She left his body in his shower where friends found him about five days later at his suburban Phoenix home.

She acknowledged she killed Alexander, but claimed it was self-defense after he attacked her.

Prosecutors said it was premeditated murder carried out in a jealous rage after the victim wanted to end their affair and planned a trip to Mexico with another woman.

Weeks after Arias was convicted, the jury failed to reach a unanimous decision on her punishment.

Her attorneys have since sought, unsuccessfully, to dismiss the death penalty as an option.
