A former Texas high school student pleaded guilty Thursday to paying a classmate $4,000 to kill his mother.

Danish Minhas was 17 when he offered to pay Nur Mohamed, then 18, to stab his mother, who he had complained was too strict.

Mohamed has already pleaded guilty to the killing, telling a court last year how Minhas had driven him to the family home in November 2009.

Tabassum Khan, 43, was found stabbed to death in her apartment. Two weeks after her murder, Ms Khan's son, Minhas, was arrested over the killing.

Minhas, a popular student who used to read the morning announcements over the 
public address system at Fort Lee High School, which he and Mohamed attended, believed his mother was too strict, investigators said.

When he appeared in court Thursday, he pleaded guilty to murder in exchange for a 50-year prison term. He could have faced life in prison if he had been convicted by a jury.

'I think this was a very unusual crime. It's very very sad and hard to contemplate why anyone would want to do this,' prosecutor Angela Weltin said, according to the Houston Chronicle.

Minhas fell under suspicion after telling detectives he had been on a date, then said he had been driving around Galveston.

'This was a strict Muslim family and Danish never would have been allowed to be out all night,'Â  Sergeant Brian Harris told ABC 13 in 2010.

The student had been the one to discover the body of his mother, who was stabbed more than three dozen times by Mohamed.

Her killer was caught after detectives linked a bloody handprint found on a doorknob to Mohamed, who was arrested for drug charges at school a few weeks later.

Mohamed told a court last year that Minhas took him to the family's apartment and signaled that his mother was home.

After the killing, Mohamed claimed that Minhas drove him home. He claimed that the student had 'just smiled' when a court asked if his victim's son had shown any remorse.
