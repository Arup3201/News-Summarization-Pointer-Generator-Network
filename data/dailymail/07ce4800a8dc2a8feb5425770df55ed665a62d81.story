Dr Pamela Douglas busts the myths about what makes a contented newborn

The first four months of a baby’s life can be a testing time for parents and caregivers.

The wide range of confusing, and sometimes conflicting advice available can create even more anxiety at an already stressful time.

Brisbane GP and infant health expert Dr Pamela Douglas cuts through the confusion in her new book The Discontented Little Baby Book.

The mother-of-two has busted the top six myths about caring for newborns.

Myth 1. Babies need to be taught how to sleep

Babies don’t need to be taught how to sleep – sleep is a normal biological process, which can’t be forced. 

It is not under conscious control. Sleep is actually controlled by two biological sleep regulators and our job is to remove obstacles that are often put in the way of healthy sleep.

Parents may be told that if they don’t teach their baby to sleep now, that child will become a poor sleeper later in childhood, with negative effects on learning and development.

But this is simply not true, if you look at the latest evidence.

Dr Douglas believes that babies don’t need to be taught how to sleep – sleep is a normal biological process which can’t be forced

 Myth 2. Feed/play/sleep cycles are the best way to get your baby into a good sleep routine

Sleepiness at the end of a feed is caused by the hormones of satiety and relaxation, and is a sign that the normal biological sleep regulators are kicking in. 

Sleepiness at the end of feeds is a powerful biological cue; by deliberately ignoring this cue and not letting your baby fall asleep at the end of a feed, which is often what parents are told to do, we interfere with the healthy function of the sleep regulators. 

The sleep may not last for long but catnapping during the day is quite normal for babies.

Myth 3. Back-arching, breast refusal and vomiting are signs of gastro-oesphageal reflux disease (GORD) in this age group

Back-arching at the breast, pulling off of the breast or refusing to feed actually signal a feeding problem, one that can be helped by a health professional who is trained in clinical breastfeeding support. 

Vomiting (once medical conditions like pyloric stenosis have been ruled out) is normal and peaks at about four months.

Myth 4. Burping helps settle babies

Burping is a practice that spread around the world with the British Empire, but is unnecessary. 

Babies relieve themselves of any wind naturally from any position, just like you and me. 

If it seems to be working for you, that’s fine – but if your baby is unsettled, I usually recommend not burping, because it disrupts that lovely sleepiness at the end of the feed which allows the baby’s biological sleep regulators to kick in.

Myth 5. Babies need a quiet, dark sleep environment free of stimulus

Many families are told that their baby is unsettled because of over-stimulation, but this is not true.

This false belief can be traced back directly to the concern doctors felt at the beginning of the 20th century about the effects of electric lighting, motor transport and radio on children’s developing brains, and has persisted despite lack of evidence. 

In fact, all the new neuroscience research suggests that under-stimulation of the senses from long periods spent in quiet, dark rooms during the day represents the greater risk.

Myth 6. Sleep breeds sleep

This adage is a misinterpretation of the fact that a baby who is relaxed and content falls asleep easily; that is, calm breeds calm. 

But sleep can’t be forced, and babies’ sleep needs are incredibly varied. 

Your baby might need half as much sleep as the baby next door in the same 24-hour period, and both babies are normal. 

Removing the obstacles to sleep – like long naps during the day in artificially dark and quiet rooms, or following a feed/play/sleep routine – will help your baby’s natural sleep regulators do their job.
