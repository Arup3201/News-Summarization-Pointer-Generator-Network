A soldier who is facing the death penalty over the murder of his five-year-old daughter in Hawaii has pleaded with jurors to spare his life.

Naeem Williams read a statement in court on Wednesday in which he apologized for his actions, as a jury meets to decide whether he should face the death sentence.

Williams was convicted of capital murder in April, after beating his young daughter, Talia, to death in July 2005.

Sentencing: Naeem Williams could face the death penalty after being found guilty of murdering his child, Talia

Victim: Talia Williams was five years old when her father, Naeem, beat her to death

In the final fatal blow, Williams left an imprint of
 his knuckle on Talia's chest. She had been beaten and struck with fists and belts for seven months.

In his statement, delivered with long pauses and sniffles, WIlliams said: 'Talia deserved a better father than me.

'Instead of helping and protecting Talia, I hurt and I killed her.'

After reading his statement to the court on Wednesday, there was little visible reaction from the jurors.

They previously heard him testify that while he was stationed in Hawaii, he and Talia's stepmother, Delilah Williams, beat the child almost daily.

He claimed he was disciplining her for bathroom accidents and because of frustrations he was experiencing in his marriage.

Plea deal: Williams with his wife, Delilah, who detailed how they beat her step-daughter Talia for seven months

Abused: The court was told Talia was beaten nearly every day for seven months by her father and step-mother

The child's stepmother, Deliliah, testified against her husband as part of a plea deal for a 20-year sentence.

She had revealed graphic and disturbing details of abuse earlier in the trial, which included withholding food 
from Talia for days at a time.

She also said the five-year-old had been beaten while she was duct-taped 
to a bed, pulled so hard by the hair that she was left with a bald 
spot, and stomped on her until bone cracked.

The parents took Talia out of school shortly before her death to hide the signs of the abuse.

Tragic: Talia was beaten to death in 2005

Naeem Williams testified previously that he 
delayed calling 911 when Talia didn't get up from one of his blows. He 
said he and his wife fretted over making sure a relative could pick up 
the infant.

If Williams is sentenced to death, it will be the first time in the history of Hawaii's statehood because territorial leaders abolished capital punishment in 1957.

Because the crime occurred on military property, the case is in federal court, where the death penalty is available.

Williams said he wants the chance to be a better father to his two other children, an 11-year-old son who lives in Georgia and a nine-year-old daughter who lives in Tennessee.

The children testified Wednesday that they enjoy their relationship with him even though he is incarcerated in Hawaii.

His
 daughter was born in Hawaii and was an infant when Talia was killed. 
She said she has visited him at the Honolulu Federal Detention Center.

Her mother is being held at the same facility after she pleaded guilty to her role in Talia's death.

The
 girl said she talks to her dad on the phone every Sunday and emails 
him. The boy said he talks to his father three to five times a month and
 emails him a couple times a month.

'We talk about a lot of stuff. We might talk about maybe who's playing basketball or who's your favorite team,' the boy told the court.

He broke down in tears when asked how he feels about his father, telling the court: 'I love my dad. I really need him.'
