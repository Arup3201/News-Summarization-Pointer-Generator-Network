In an unlikely match, a baby chimp and a lynx cub have become the best of friends. 

Varli, a 20-month-old chimpanzee and his nine-week-old pal Sutra, struck up the friendship at Myrtle Beach Safari, in South Carolina, U.S. 

The pair spend their days chasing each other around the wildlife park, having a cuddle and even sleep side-by-side.

Director of the park, Dr Bhangavan Antel, told The Sun: 'It's a natural friendship.

'Varli gives Sutra the ability to have so much more adventure. He lives with him around the clock.'

A lynx is a medium-sized wildcat with a short tail and tufts of black hair on the tips of its ears.

The smallest of the species are the bobcat and Canada lynx while the largest is the Eurasian lynx.
