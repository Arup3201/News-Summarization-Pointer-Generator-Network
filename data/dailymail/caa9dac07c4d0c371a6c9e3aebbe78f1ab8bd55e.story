It has been a long wait for Roberto Soldado. More than six months since his last goal at White Hart Lane, but when it came, it was perfectly timed.

In slid Soldado to divert yet another low grubber from Andros Townsend past Nottingham Forest goalkeeper Dorus de Vries and so fire Tottenham into a date with Brighton in the fourth round of the Capital One Cup.

Perhaps more importantly, the Spanish striker saved Spurs when they seemed destined for 30 minutes of extra-time, the possibility of penalties and a further waste of nervous energy, just three days before their trip to Arsenal.

Only eight minutes remained when Soldado pounced. What a welcome relief it was for Pochettino, who has seen his team struggle through four games without a win and watched them go behind on Wednesday night to a goal from Forest teenager Jorge Grant on his debut.

The upset looked very much on, at this point. Forest had played with great intensity and were worth their lead. The travelling supporters, many wearing green sweatshirts in tribute to Brian Clough who died 10 years ago, sang ‘Psycho is back’.

Manager Stuart Pearce swung his fist through the air, but Pochettino reacted and finally managed to inject some urgency into his side with an influential double change. On came Ryan Mason to score his first ever Tottenham goal to level the tie and Harry Kane, who grabbed his team’s third in stoppage time.

In between was Soldado’s first goal at home since early March. Three goals in 18 minutes had punctured Forest’s fun but the green shoots of progress on the field are more important than the green jumpers of tribute in the away end.

‘It was a great performance and one the club should be proud of,’ said Pearce. ‘It doesn’t sit comfortably with me when we get beaten. I am disappointed we lost, but it was against a very good side who cost multi-millions. It shows Nottingham Forest is going in the right direction. We’re making baby steps and we have to continue pushing the club in that direction.’

It’s true Pearce has them upwardly mobile: top of the Championship and full of confidence as they tackled opponents from the Barclays Premier League.

Pochettino changed all 11 of those who started against West Brom on Sunday but Forest also made it clear they have other priorities, with nine changes of their own. Top scorer Britt Assombalonga did not even travel to London.

Amid the blur, there was and home debuts for Benjamin Stambouli and Federico Fazio and a debut for goalkeeper Michel Vorm, who was beaten by Ben Osborn in the first half but saved by his woodwork.

It was a fabulous dribble by Osborn, who slipped past Fazio and unleashed a fierce left-footer, which curled past Vorm’s dive, crashed into the bar and back into the goalmouth.

Stambouli and Fazio were among those who seemed caught out by Forest’s desire and intensity. Tottenham were sluggish. In the first half, all they had by way of attacking intent was an ambitious appeal for a penalty from Paulinho, after the slightest of shirt-tugs by Danny Fox, and long-range punts from Townsend and Fazio.

Paulinho went close after the break but Forest went ahead in the 61st minute. Lars Veldwijk was given time to work the ball across goal from the left, Stephen McLaughlin flicked it at the near post and Grant arrived totally unmarked to convert from eight yards out.

Pochettino sent on his substitutes and Mason soon equalised with a brilliant swerving strike from 25 yards, although goalkeeper De Vries might think he could have done more to keep it out.

‘I’ve been waiting for that for a long time,’ said Mason. ‘I’ve always been confident in ability. I’ve had to wait a lot longer than others but I thought I made a difference.’ He did. Tottenham finished strongly. Townsend rattled the bar with a free-kick, before his effort was turned in by Soldado to lift the mood. Kane made it three, low from an angle after a pass from Erik Lamela.

‘I was calm, because we needed to be calm, after this disaster,’ smiled Pochettino. ‘We always believed we could come back into the game. I am happy for the players. They never gave up. This is the mentality we need to have.’
