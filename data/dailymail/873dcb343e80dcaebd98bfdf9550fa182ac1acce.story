As the last remaining venue from London's 1948 Olympics, it was hardly the legacy that organisers  would have hoped to leave behind.

With its near-derelict pavilion, sealed off storage sheds and deteriorating track, the velodrome at Herne Hill had become more of a hindrance than an heirloom.

But after decades of gradual decay the south-east London track, where triple Olympic champion Bradley Wiggins began his cycling career, is finally going to be renovated in a bid to restore it to its former glory.

Glory days: The velodrome at Herne Hill used to be packed on race days

Key track repairs, expected to last six weeks, are the first major work on the site since a 15-year lease between the Dulwich Estate landowners and British Cycling, as secure tenant, was signed earlier this year.

The pavilion will then be rebuilt with state-of-the-art changing rooms, a gym and a cafe.

It is a remarkable turn around for the venue, built in  1891, which during its heyday attracted 10,000 people to its 450 metre banked track, but has slowly dilapidated due to a lack of investment.

A Save the Velodrome campaign was launched late last year after the state of the venue meant there was a very real danger of closure.

Among the first of the 'extensive structural repairs' is the strengthening and resurfacing of the track, according to BC's facilities officer Patrick Flanagan.

He said: 'It currently has a concrete base with an epoxy resin finish. This finish has failed and cracked, allowing water to enter the structure and, in conjunction with frost, cause extensive damage, alongside some settling of the concrete base.

'The repairs will start with this concrete base, which will be mended with fibreglass reinforcement at each joint.

'It was originally made in 10-metre lengths and where these join, unevenness is now a problem.

'The repairs will provide a strong and very smooth base upon which the new track surface can be laid.'

A special fine granite stone covering called MasterTrack, which is smooth, hard and dense, will then be laid.

Mr Flanagan added: 'It is also impervious to water, so damage from the elements will be eliminated.

'The new surface will be seven metres wide and laying it presents some challenges.

'Its width, combined with the camber, which changes in the bends, and the need for an extremely smooth finish, make it remarkably difficult to lay.

'Tarmac has developed a unique rig which runs on a track inside the cycling track. This allows them to lay the surface in three wide strips.

'So, all in all, it's a pretty special project with some unique problems and equally unique solutions.'

Funding has come from BC's Whole Sport Plan and a bequest from London resident and De Laune Cycling Club member Leonard Lyes, who died in July 2009.

He asked that his money be used 'in the pursuit of track cycling'.

Getting the track repaired is 'a huge step forward' for the Save the Velodrome campaign, according to British Cycling chief executive Ian Drake.

He said: 'It will provide riders of all ages with a fantastic surface on which to enjoy their cycling.

'Herne Hill is such an iconic venue and British Cycling is both delighted and proud of the role it is playing in helping getting it back to its former glory.'

Hillary Peachey, chairwoman of the Save the Velodrome campaign, added: 'These works are a turning point for the Herne Hill Velodrome.

'Barely a year ago the future of this incredible site was uncertain.

'The lack of a long-term lease combined with a series of harsh winters was threatening to overcome all the hard work which has been put into the track over the decades and there was a very real threat of closure.'
