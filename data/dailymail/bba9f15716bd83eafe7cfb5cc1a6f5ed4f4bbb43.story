It’s regarded as one of most promising places for alien life in the solar system.

But missions to Europa have been few and far between, with many questions about this frozen moon still left unanswered.

Now in an effort to carry out some key research on Jupiter's moon, Nasa is finally looking at proposals – but they’re sticking to a tight budget.

Nasa is now accepting mission proposals to explore Jupiter's icy moon Europa. In this image, taken by Voyager 2 as it flew by on 9 July 1979, can be seen chaos terrain, faults and ridges that are almost certaintly the result of a vast, ice-capped global ocean underground

Nasa issued the Request for Information (RFI) to science and engineering communities for ideas for a mission to Europa to be submitted by 30 May.

The RFI's focus is for concepts for a mission to Europa that costs less than $1 billion (£590 million), excluding the rocket that would take them into space.

Each mission proposal must aim to meet as many of the science priorities as possible recommended by the National Research Council's 2011 Planetary Science Decadal Survey for the study of Europa.

‘This is an opportunity to hear from those creative teams that have ideas on how we can achieve the most science at minimum cost,’ said John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for the Nasa Science Mission Directorate at the agency's headquarters in Washington.

‘Europa is one of the most interesting sites in our solar system in the search for life beyond Earth.

‘The drive to explore Europa has stimulated not only scientific interest but also the ingenuity of engineers and scientists with innovative concepts.’

Nasa has studied a variety of mission designs and concepts in previous years and currently is funding the development of technologies that will be needed for the science instruments for a Europa mission.

The Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey is a review of astronomy and astrophysics literature produced every 10 years.

It recommends research priorities for the coming decade based on the review.

The 2011 Decadal Survey deemed a mission to Jupiter moon’s Europa as among the highest priority scientific pursuits for Nasa.

It
 lists five key science objectives in priority order that are necessary 
to improve our understanding of this potentially habitable moon.

The mission will need to:

• Characterise the extent of the ocean and its relation to the deeper interior.

•
 Characterise the ice shell and any subsurface water, and see how they interact.

• Determine global surface compositions and chemistry, especially with regards to habitability.

•
 Understand the formation of surface features, including sites of recent
 or current activity, and identify and characterise candidate sites for 
future detailed exploration.

• Understand Europa's space environment and interaction with Jupiter's magnetosphere.

There have been various proposals to explore Europa over the years, such as the Cryobot (pictured) which would be taken underground by a larger drill before it was then released into the ocean, searching for signs of past or present alien life

Congress appropriated $80 million (£47 million) for this work in the Nasa’s last budget, while the most recent budget proposal requests an additional $15 million (£9 million).

Previous scientific findings point to the existence of a liquid water ocean located under the moon's icy crust.

This ocean covers Europa entirely and contains more liquid water than all of Earth's oceans combined.

Although Europa and Jupiter's other moons have been visited by other spacecraft, they were each limited to a single distant flyby of these satellites.

Nasa’s Galileo spacecraft, launched in 1989 by the space shuttle, was the only mission to make repeated visits to Europa, passing close by the moon fewer than a dozen times.

In December 2013, Nasa’s Hubble Space Telescope observed water vapour above the moon's frigid south polar region.

This provided the first strong evidence of water plumes erupting off the moon's surface, and a spacecraft could even be designed to fly through the plumes to make measurements of the composition of the underground ocean.

Any 
mission to Europa must take into account the harsh radiation environment
 that would require unique protection of the spacecraft and instruments.

In addition, spacecraft must meet planetary protection requirements intended to protect Europa's potentially habitable ocean.

These requirements are very strict and involve ensuring that a viable Earth organism is not introduced into the Europa ocean.

Water plumes seen spouting from the surface provide evidence for the existence of a vast ocean beneath Europa. It is thought the moon holds more water than all the oceans and sea on Earth combined, making it one of the most attractive science destinations in the solar system

The last spacecraft to visit Europa was New Horizons (artist's illustration shown), which flew past the icy moon in 2007. The Nasa vehicle is now on its way to Pluto, which it will arrive at in July 2015
