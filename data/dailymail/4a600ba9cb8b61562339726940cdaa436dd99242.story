A woman attacked a fellow mother and love rival in an 'ugly' brawl outside a primary school at home time.

Horrified children and parents watched on as Maryam Hussein, 24, launched into a fight with Maryam Mohammed, 32, Manchester Crown Court heard.

The fight occurred at the end of the day at St Philip's Church of England Primary School in Hulme, Manchester.

The women ended up rolling about on the ground as the victim's 10-year-old son tried to help his mother, the court heard.

Hussein was in a relationship with the victim’s ex-partner, and had warned her that she would ‘break her legs’ if she didn’t stay away from him.

Violence erupted after the women went to the school to pick up their children, with Hussein kicking Miss Mohammed’s car and damaging the wing mirror.

Hussein’s 22-year-old brother Abdullah joined the bust-up, kicking the victim when she was on the ground and ‘aggressively’ restraining her little boy when he tried to help.

Mum-of-three Hussein, and her brother, were both given community punishments.

Hussein, of Clarendon Street, Hulme, admitted common assault and criminal damage. Her brother, of Walmer Street, Rusholme, admitted common assault.

Hussein had earlier threatened to break the legs of the victim before they met at the school gates

Prosecuting, Steven Wild said: 'Miss [Mohammed] received a phone call at 10 o’clock in the morning in which Miss Hussein said: "Listen bitch, you don’t know me, but you will know me now. If you and your kids don’t stop talking to Abie [her partner] I’m going to have to come and break your legs."

'Miss Mohammed said she would need to speak to Abie because he was the father of her children.'

Miss Mohammed ‘thought nothing of it’, and later that day went to collect her children from St Philip’s.

But at the school gates she saw Hussein, who repeated the threat.

The court heard that when the victim asked Abdullah Hussein to tell his sister to leave her alone, he said: 'This is my sister - if you don’t stop what you’re doing I’ll break your legs myself.'

At that point Maryam Hussein lunged and the two women began to struggle.

Miss Mohammed was later seen by a police officer ‘clearly distressed with visible injuries’, including with scratch marks on her face.

Robert Golinski, defending Maryam Hussein, said: 'The prospects of repetition are extremely remote.'

The court heard Hussein is no longer with the man at the centre of the row. Her brother was said to be ‘deeply ashamed’.

Sentencing, Judge Robert Atherton described the incident as ‘ugly’.

Maryam Hussein was given a 12-month supervision order with a requirement to attend a probation service programme - and given a retraining order which bars her from contacting the victim.

Abdullah Hussein was given 56 hours of unpaid work.
