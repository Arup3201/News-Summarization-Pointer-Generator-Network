Queensland Police are utilising a range of state-of-the-art robots as they carry out thorough searches in Brisbane ahead of the G20 summit.

The robot-cops cost an estimated $750,000 each, but Police believe this is nothing compared to the human lives they could save. 

The hi-tech devices, which are called tEODor  Explosive Ordnance Robots, can be used to disarm booby traps, improvised explosive devices and other dangerous objects. 

The modern robots are being used during the G20 summit checkpoints as a response capability for members of the Queensland Police Service's Explosive Ordinance Response Team.

tEODor robots can easily lift 100kg, they have four high-resolution cameras and can be equipped with a range of accessories and weapons.

In the past, tEODor has been used to  disarm and dispose of bombs as well and utilise its camera to enter undesirable locations to collect data for officers waiting outside.

This allows for the police to send in the capable robot when a bomb is detected, without putting human lives in jeopardy.  

The machines also perform monitoring and investigation of objects in exceptionally dangerous conditions.

The robots are described as being robust, reliable and flexible in use. 

The innovative bomb disposal system has the ability to climb at an angle of 45 degrees.

They are designed as twin-track vehicles with extremely good manoeuvrability and good properties on open ground.

Both the vehicle and the manipulator have to be operated with extreme delicacy.

When climbing up slopes or on a steep gradient, safety brakes kick in automatically and hold the robot in place.

The robots assist with reconnaissance of suspect devices, including providing camera and X-ray vision.

The tEODor's conduct post-blast examinations and remotely render safe IEDs, either insitu or by removing to another location.

The robot measures 4 feet tall by 4.5 feet long  and tips the scales at a huge 826 pounds.

More than 400 tEODor robots are in use in over 40 countries.  

Queensland Police Services told Daily Mail Australia that  they are not just being used for the summit and are available to the police service in Queensland at all times.

Specialist soldiers with experience in war zones will help also ward off the risk of a terrorist attack during the summit.

The world's most powerful leaders will descend on Brisbane in less than two weeks and the Queensland Police are making sure they are taking every precaution they can in the run up to the event. 

Every vehicle that drives into the G20 summit restricted zone will be searched.

Search points will be staffed by soldiers, police, dogs and bomb robots to ensure every part of the vehicle is thoroughly searched.

Police are aware of 26 planned protests which will take place in the coming 11 days. 

They are monitoring these groups in the hope that they will remain peaceful and there will be no need for violence.

There has already been two people formally banned from entering Brisbane CBD while the G20 summit is taking place. 

They are known troublemakers to the police.

Police are still encouraging Brisbane locals to enter the city while the G20 summit is ongoing. 

'Brisbane residents and business owners are reminded that Brisbane is open for business both in the lead up to and over the G20 long weekend,' they said.

'You will be able to go about your usual business around the time of the summit however you may need to go about your business in a slightly different way and will need to plan ahead.'

Within the G20 Act there are three key security areas. Declared areas, restricted areas and motorcade areas. 

There will be no physical barriers around the declared areas, and people will be able to go about their business within these areas.
