Jailed: Robert Fryer was accused of leading a 'Jekyll and Hyde life' and suffering from somnophilia - a condition which makes him aroused by 'interfering' with a sleeping person

A 'sleep fetishist' who spiked two women’s drinks and took pictures of them unconscious before raping one has been jailed for eight years.

Robert Fryer, 30, drugged the women before taking lurid photos while they were passed out leaving his victims’ lives 'completely shattered', a court heard.

Nottingham Crown Court was told Fryer led a 'Jekyll and Hyde life' and suffered from somnophilia - a condition which makes him aroused by 'interfering' with a sleeping woman.

His depraved actions were only discovered when he boasted to a friend that he had 'spiked the drinks of a number of girls' before taking pictures of them 'in various sexual poses' while they slept, the court was told.

Despite assuming Fryers was joking, the friend went to police who later found 'hundreds of pornographic images of adult females in an apparent unconscious state' on his mobile phone and computer.

Fryer, of Thurgarton, Nottinghamshire, pleaded guilty to three charges of rape and one charge of assault by penetration involving one of the victims on Friday.

He also admitted causing another woman to engage in sexual activity without consent, and a further charge of sexual assault.

Judge Jonathan Teare jailed Fryer for eight years for the three charges of rape and one charge of assault by penetration, to be served concurrently.

He was also sentenced to three years for the other two charges, also concurrent.

He will be on the Sex Offenders’ Register for life and banned from working with children.

Judge Teare told him: 'You have never been in any sort of criminal trouble before, but having said that underlying your personality has been what almost amounts to an illness for some years.

'I have to approach the sentence on the basis that you did administer either alcohol or drugs to both of these girls, and that you took complete advantage of their unconsciousness.'

Christopher Lowe, prosecuting, told the court: 'An informer reported to the police to the effect that he (Fryer) had been talking about how on a number of occasions he had spiked the drinks of a number of girls and having done that photographed them in various sexual poses while in an unconscious state.

'To start with the friend put that admission down as some sort of sick boast or joke, however, such was their concern they decided to report it to the police.

'There were hundreds of pornographic images of adult females in an apparent unconscious state on his phone and computer.

'Among them were pictures of the two women who had no recollection of them having been taken.'

In statements read out to the court the women, who cannot be named for legal reasons, described how their lives had been changed forever.

The first victim said: 'My entire life has been shattered into thousands of tiny pieces and my soul feels broken into. Every single minute of every single day is a struggle for me.

'My trust of men now is nonexistent.'

The second victim said the images had left her 'feeling extremely vulnerable', adding: 'I do not know the last time I slept without a care in the world.'

Adrian Reynolds, defending, said a psychiatric report found Fryer suffered with somnophilia.

She added that Fryer also denied the claim that he had drugged the victims.

He said: 'He doesn’t accept that he used anything to stupify anyone. He told doctors that the statement to a friend was an idle boast.

'On one hand he was a young man from a good family but all the time there was this dark side to him which has caused him to be here today.

'The psychiatric report shows someone who recognises that he has had a problem.'

Fryer also pleaded not guilty to further charges of assault by penetration, two charges of sexual assault, and one charge of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent.

The pleas were accepted by the court and the charges ordered to lie on file.
