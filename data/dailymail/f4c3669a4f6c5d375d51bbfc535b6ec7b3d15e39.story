Emoji have already taken over the web and now they're gunning for real world too.

Developers have created a keyboard cover that turns every key of the board into one of the small, iconic pictures.

Once installed, the Caps Lock key lets users switch between regular and emoji keys meaning people can easily add images to Facebook posts, tweets and even official documents.

The Emoji Keyboard and its custom software were developed by a team of designers at California-based Disk Cactus. 

The team has set up a Kickstarter campaign to fund production of at least 1,000 covers, but hopes to be able to mass produce them by the end of the year. 

At the time of writing it has raised more than $3,570 (£2,400)  of its $20,000 (£13,500) target. 

Each of the covers are made of silicone and act like standard covers to block out dust, dirt and liquid.

They come in two sizes -  one for standard Macs, which includes the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro, the MacBook Air 13 and the Apple Wireless Mac keyboard, and one for the 11-inch MacBook Air.

The software works with Mac OS X in the same way as other languages and is supported by the majority of popular apps. More than 150 emoji (pictured) are accessible directly from the keyboard but using the Shift, Control, and Option keys gives access to related characters

However, only US versions of the cover are currently available.  

'Whether you are writing an email, or surfing the net, you can access over 150 of your favourite emoji without interrupting your flow,' said Disk Cactus.

'After you receive your keyboard cover, download our installer to enable the emoji keyboard layout.

'We put a lot of thought into this layout. Once you explore a bit, you will quickly memorise the locations of your favorite emoji characters. The printed keys are your hieroglyphic guide.'

The cover is available from Kickstarter for just $15 (£10) and, if funded, will ship in April.

Emoji were originally popular in Japan, and widely used online.

However, in recent years they have become hugely popular elsewhere.

Originally meaning pictograph, the word emoji literally means 'picture'
 (e) + 'letter' (moji).

Icons
 are standardised and include some specific to Japanese culture, such as
 a bowing (apologising) businessman, a face wearing a face mask, a white
 flower used to denote 'brilliant homework' or a group of emoji 
representing popular foods: ramen noodles, dango, onigiri, Japanese 
curry, and sushi.

Some 
emoji character sets have been incorporated into Unicode, allowing them 
to be used elsewhere including websites and apps such as Facebook and Twitter. 

The keyboard is the latest in a long line of apps and services related to emoji. 

Last year a pair of London-based developers created the Emojli app that only let users communicate using the popular miniature images. 

Even usernames have to be comprised of a selection of emoticons.

And with the release of iOS 8 Apple allowed app developers to create emoji-based keyboards for iPhones, iPads and iPhones. 

A study in April last year found that the top trending word, at that time, was emoji. There are now apps dedicated  to the small images. Emojli, for example, (pictured) only lets users communicate using the popular pictures, and even usernames have to be comprised of a selection of emoticons
