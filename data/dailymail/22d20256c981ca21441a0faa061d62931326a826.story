Wildlife presenter Chris Packham was reprimanded by the BBC for tweeting his views on the culling of badgers.

Mr Packham branded government officials 'brutalist thugs, liars and frauds' in a series of tweets.

He posted the tweets at the end of August on the eve of a cull to stop the spread of bovine tuberculosis.

Another one of the tweets read: 'I feel sick, sad disempowered, betrayed, angry and crushed by the corruption of all that I know is right.'

BBC bosses launched an investigation into the tweets following a complaint by the Countryside Alliance which claimed they went against BBC impartiality rules.

It found that Mr Packham breached a BBC voluntary code of conduct as the tweets were not politically neutral.

The Telegraph reported that in a memo on the issue Tim Scoones, a executive producer for the BBC Natural History Team said: While Chris' recent programme, the Burrowers (broadcast in August) did not touch on the badger cull issue, we accept that the timing of these tweets was not in the spirit of this voluntary code.

The tweets were sent from Mr Packham's own Twitter account on the eve of a government action to shoot badgers

'We did also consider some of the language used in the tweets to be intemperate and we have spoken to Chris about both these issues.'

He added: 'Chris' Twitter account was not managed or supported by the BBC and although it identifies Chris as a BBC presenter, this does not imply BBC endorsement of the views aired on the account.'

Meanwhile Mr Packham is urging everyone with a large garden to install a kestrel nesting box to halt the sharp decline of the falcon in the UK.

Kestrel numbers have dropped by 30 percent since 1970 to about 30,000 breeding pairs.

Mr Packham, president of the Hawk Conservancy Trust, says the decline is partly because of a loss of the birds' nesting places.

Kestrel boxes are available from wildlife organisations and can be made from tea chests.

'They should face open space' said Mr Packham. 'Kestrels like looking out in an open environment on the edge of a wood or overlooking fields.'
