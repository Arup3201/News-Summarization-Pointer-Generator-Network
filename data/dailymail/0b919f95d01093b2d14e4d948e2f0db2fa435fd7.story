Once, it would have been unthinkable – but this year's Christmas message from the Queen included an appearance from former IRA commander Martin McGuinness.

He was shown accompanying the monarch earlier this year on a visit to Crumlin Road Gaol – where he was once imprisoned.

The footage played as the Queen stressed the importance of reconciliation, after a year that nearly saw Scotland leave the United Kingdom.

Two years ago, the monarch shook hands with Mr McGuinness, now Northern Ireland’s Deputy First Minister, when they met in Belfast for the first time.

He also enjoyed a private meeting with the Queen, whose cousin Lord Mountbatten was murdered by the IRA in 1979. Mr McGuinness, who later said that he ‘liked’ the Queen, went on to attend a state banquet at Windsor Castle this year, where he shook her hand once again.

The monarch began yesterday’s televised address by talking about a sculpture of a man and woman embracing by Josefina de Vasconcellos called Reconciliation, casts of which can be found in Berlin, Coventry and Belfast.

She said: ‘The benefits of reconciliation were clear to see when I visited Belfast in June. While my tour of the set of Game Of Thrones may have gained most attention, my visit to the Crumlin Road Gaol will remain vividly in my mind. What was once a prison during The Troubles is now a place of hope and fresh purpose ... a reminder of what is possible when people reach out to one another, rather like the couple in the sculpture.’

While she did not mention Mr McGuinness by name, his image appeared on screen as footage of the Queen’s visit was played.

Yesterday’s message also saw the monarch admit that many felt ‘great disappointment’ after Scotland rejected independence – while others felt ‘great relief’. She added: ‘Bridging these differences will take time.’

The Queen had strived to maintain a neutral position in the run-up to this year’s poll, but was quoted telling one voter near her Balmoral estate that Scots should ‘think very carefully about the future’ – widely interpreted as a plea to reject independence.

Resplendent in a purple Angela Kelly dress, the Queen recorded her message next to a table displaying portraits of her grandparents George V and Queen Mary – the latter of whom passed down the diamond and pearl brooch pinned to her shoulder.

The speech, recorded earlier this month in Buckingham Palace’s state dining room, also touched on the Christmas truce, which took place 100 years ago during the First World War and saw soldiers from both sides lay down their weapons, and meet between the trenches to play football.

The Queen said: ‘Without any instruction or command, the shooting stopped.’ She later added: ‘Sometimes it seems that reconciliation stands little chance in the face of war and discord. But, as the Christmas truce a century ago reminds us, peace and goodwill have lasting power in the hearts of men and women.’

The Queen also turned to the religious significance of Christmas, describing how Jesus Christ was an ‘inspiration and an anchor in my life’ which has ‘taught me to seek to respect and value all people, of whatever faith or none’.

Mr McGuinness acknowledges he is a former IRA member – but denies being part of its seven-man decision-making Army Council.

In 1973 he was sentenced to six months in jail after being arrested near a car containing 250 pounds of explosives and nearly 5,000 rounds of ammunition. He claims he left the IRA in 1974.

The Queen’s table displayed an embossed brass box created for the Sailors & Soldiers Christmas Fund, which began in 1914. 

Princess Mary invited the public to help provide troops with Christmas gifts; by 1920, more than two million boxes were used to send presents from tobacco to chocolate. 

While the Queen’s is an original, this year the Mail gave away stunning replicas to readers.
