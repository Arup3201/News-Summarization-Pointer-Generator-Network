Commuters were left with flight delays, disruptions to ferry services and traffic warnings, as dense fog rolled across outer suburbs of Sydney on Saturday morning.

Sydney Airport was forced to delay take offs and landings and some incoming services were diverted to other cities.

'There are still flights coming in, but obviously for safety reasons everything is slowed down,' a spokeswoman from Air Services Australia said.

Meanwhile, Sydney Ferries services, including the Manly Ferry was suspended due to heavy fog.

Travellers were urged to take caution on the roads, delay their journey, use alternative public transport and allow additional travel time.

The Roads and Traffic Authority's live cameras showed the fog was thicker in the western and southern suburbs.

The afternoon will expect northwesterly winds of 15 to 20 km/h, according to the Bureau of Meteorology.

The Bureau of Meteorology spokesman said 'a high pressure system in the Tasman Sea and low wind speeds has brought the fog.'

Neil Fraser from the Bureau of Meteorology said fog like this occurred about three times each year.

'Looks like it's fairly widespread,' he said.

'At the moment the airport's got a decent north westerly blowing, about 13 kms an hour. It forms elsewhere and then drifts across to the airport.'
