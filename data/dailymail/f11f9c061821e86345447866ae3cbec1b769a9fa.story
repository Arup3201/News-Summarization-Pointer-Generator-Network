David Cameron today called on union boss Bob Crow to call off his 'shameful' Tube strike which is expected to cause travel chaos across the capital from tonight.

The Prime Minister said the industrial action over ticket office closures was 'plain wrong' and should be called off immediately.

Members of the Rail, Maritime and 
Transport union (RMT) and the Transport Salaried Staffs Association 
(TSSA) will walk out for 48 hours from 9pm tonight and again at the same time 
next week.

Transport for London warned that services will be hit from this evening until Friday morning, causing travel chaos for passengers.

Mr Cameron said: 'Bob Crow’s Tube strike is plain wrong and he should call it off today.

'His shameful plans will bring misery to millions of hardworking families in London. Ed Miliband should condemn the strike immediately — no ifs and no buts,' he told the Evening Standard.

The London Chamber of Commerce suggests the action will cost £50million-a-day, or £200million across the four days of strikes.

The Prime Minister's strongly-worded attack comes after London Mayor Boris Johnson clashed with Mr Crow on live radio.

Mr Johnson described the strike as 
'totally pointless' and admitted that he had not spoken directly to Mr 
Crow since 'a few years ago'.

He said: 'I can't possibly sit
 down and talk to Bob Crow when he is not negotiating with our team, 
with the London Underground staff and they are threatening a totally 
pointless and, definitely will be, debilitating strike.'

Appearing
 on LBC 97.3, he said: 'There are no compulsory redundancies here. 
Nobody is being forced out and actually we have so far had more than 
1,000 expressions of interest in voluntary redundancies, so we are 
already there.'

But minutes later Mr Crow appeared as a called on the mayor's phone-in to claim he would 'love' to call off the strike.

'We are not here to score points - all we want is an opportunity to negotiate about the Tube,' Mr Crow said.

'We are asking you to listen to our point of view. We would love to call the strike off.'

Mr Crow accused the mayor of refusing to suspend the ticket office closures.

But Mr Johnson replied: 'That is complete nonsense. We are more than happy to engage on these issues. Of course there are job losses involved but there are no compulsory redundancies.

'We have already had more than 1,000 people showing an interest in voluntary redundancy.

'Call off this pointless strike which will do nothing other than cost your members their wages.'

Mr Crow said later it was clear the mayor was still refusing to meet unions.

Labour's shadow transport secretary Mary Creagh said: 'Nobody wants strikes and both sides should now get back around the negotiating table and sort this out as a matter of urgency.

'It is disappointing that the mayor and Transport for London have not reached a resolution with the unions ahead of this strike.'

The chief executive of a central London casino attacked the strike, saying it would hit an industry exhibition being attended by representatives from around the world.

Simon Thomas, chief executive of Hippodrome Casino in Leicester Square, said it was 'frankly embarrassing' that the exhibition at the ExCeL Centre would be disrupted by the industrial action.

'Gaming industry executives from across the world are in London this week and it is outrageous that this strike is being held.

'Just when the economy is recovering we have this prehistoric attitude, which is not welcome.'

Mr Crow and Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) general secretary Manuel Cortes have accused Boris Johnson of refusing to meet them to discuss the closure of ticket offices, and the pair went to City Hall to try to confront him.

The Mayor's official spokesman said: 'Mr Crow and Mr Cortes are now grandstanding. If they were really serious about meeting the mayor they wouldn't have called a strike in the middle of a consultation, a strike that 70 per cent of members haven't voted for.

'Instead they could have engaged constructively with TfL before we ever reached Acas, where only yesterday they refused a fresh offer of dialogue which would involve extending the consultation period. The mayor's door is open if they call off this pointless strike.'

Sun-worshipper Bob Crow may be 
red-faced, but the union chief was far from embarrassed when forced to 
defend his lavish £10,000 sunshine holiday.

On
 the eve of a crippling London Underground strike, the tanned union 
leader – who was pictured baking on Rio's Copacabana beach - retorted:' 
What do you want me to do? Sit under a tree and read Karl Marx every day?'

The
 £145,000 a year general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport 
Workers Union jetted back to Britain from Brazil at the weekend ahead of
 industrial action that will leave passengers facing travel chaos in the
 capital.

Today, defiant Crow revealed he booked the holiday from an advert in the Daily Mail which he reads in his local gym

Last-minute talks aimed at 
averting tonight's  strike ended without agreement but Crow described 
criticism of his South American jaunt - a two week luxury cruise from 
Barbados to Brazil followed by a £250 a night five-star Rio hotel - as 
'cobblers.'

The RMT firebrand said: ' My holiday was booked up way before the strike was called.

' I spoke to people twice a day and said I would come back if needed.'

Crow has faced a mounting backlash for masterminding the London strikes during his luxury holiday.

Last
 week the Mail revealed how Crow, 53, who lives in a council house in 
Woodford Green, east London, spent two weeks on the lavish cruise from 
Barbados to Brazil aboard the Silver Spirit liner.

The
 cruise, which included his suite with private balcony, marble bathroom 
and unlimited champagne, reportedly cost Crow and his long-term 
girlfriend Nicola Hoarau, an RMT office manager, more than £7,000.

At
 Rio, they checked into the £250-a-night five-star Windsor Atlantic 
hotel on Copacabana beach before going up Sugar Loaf Mountain.

Last
 Wednesday Crow, resplendent in Bermuda shorts and sipping from a 
coconut, was seen turning a deep lobster red after lying in the 104F 
(40C) heat for three hours.

Crow revealed he booked the holiday from an advert in the Daily Mail which he reads in his local gym.

Holding up a copy on the advert, the union leader said: ' If I want to spend £10,000 on a car or holiday then that's it. You can hound me until the end, I'm not changing.'
