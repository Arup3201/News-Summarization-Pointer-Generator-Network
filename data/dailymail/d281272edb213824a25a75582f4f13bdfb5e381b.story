Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini has confirmed that Frank Lampard will be in the squad to face his old club Chelsea on Sunday and tried to defuse any potential issues by reminding supporters that it was not his choice to leave Stamford Bridge.

Chelsea ended Lampard’s 13-year stay at the club this summer when he was released at the end of his contract, and the former England midfielder caused widespread surprise by signing for City having agreed to play for their affiliate club New York City FC in Major League Soccer next year.

Pellegrini was quick to point out that the 36-year-old would still be at Stamford Bridge if he had the choice, and should not be criticised for extending his career elsewhere.

‘Frank is part of our squad and tomorrow I will give the squad list for that game, but for sure he will be involved,’ said the City boss.

‘I don’t think it is a difficult situation for him. I think Frank didn’t continue in Chelsea because Chelsea didn’t want him, not because he wanted to come here to Manchester City.

‘He couldn’t continue with the team he played for his whole life for. He has all the rights to continue playing football. He arrived here and we are very happy with him.’
