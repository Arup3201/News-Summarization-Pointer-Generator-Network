Prepare to catch the ‘gladdies’ one last time. Age has finally caught up with Dame Edna  Everage – and she is retiring.

Barry Humphries, the man behind the glittery glasses, has announced that his character is setting out on her final tour.

And the Australian housewife won’t be alone in her retirement as Humphries’s other alter ego, the obnoxious Sir Les Patterson, will be joining her.

Hats off to you: Dame Edna's creator Barry Humphries, seen here after being made a CBE for services to entertainment, says he wants to move on to do other things

‘I’m feeling a bit senior now and it’s time to move on,’ Humphries, who is 78, said yesterday.

The comedian’s upcoming tour will be the last time Dame Edna and Sir Les will be seen on stage, although their creator admitted: ‘Edna will crop up on television, I guess, but not in a live show.’

He said: ‘The fact of the matter  is that I’m beginning to feel a bit  senior. It’s the best aerobics you could do, leaping around on stage, but  it’s gruelling when there are other things to do.’

Dame Edna was created in the 1950s when Humphries was a young actor touring southern Australia. Sir Les Patterson burst on to the scene later, cursing and spitting his way through his first stage show in 1974.

He was a dramatic contrast to Dame Edna with his nose-picking, belching and flatulence, but was an immediate hit with her fans.

By the 1980s, Dame Edna had evolved from a drab housewife from Melbourne’s working class suburb of Moonee Ponds to an international star who hosted her own talk show.

Celebrities including Sean Connery, Chubby Checker, Charlton Heston, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Mel Gibson and Dusty Springfield appeared on The Dame Edna Experience.

She became known for her glasses, her lilac curls, her ‘Hello possums!’ greeting and her ‘gladdies’ – the bunch of gladioli that she threw to the audience at the end of her live shows.

Humphries’s characters have been such a hit in Britain that he was made a CBE in 2007 for services to entertainment. In the U.S., he won  the Tony award for best special theatrical event in 2000 for Dame Edna: The Royal Tour.

But Humphries told Sydney’s Sunday Telegraph he was retiring the popular couple because there were ‘places I want to go, things I want to do’. He has also been given a contract to write another book. And although Dame Edna’s upcoming farewell tour only covers Australia at the moment, British fans may also get the chance to say their goodbyes.

Humphries said that if the show is a success in Australia, he will take it to London and New York.

Entitled Eat Pray Laugh, the show is about a journey, he added.

Providing a few clues as to what audiences can expect, he said: ‘Les has become a celebrity chef. We’ll have a kitchen on stage and Les working away, clearly preparing a meal for political colleagues.

‘Edna, of course, will be discussing her spiritual journey. She’s on a journey to find herself, to lose the trappings of mega-stardom and become a real person.’

There will also be an appearance from Humphries’s favourite character, Sandy Stone.
