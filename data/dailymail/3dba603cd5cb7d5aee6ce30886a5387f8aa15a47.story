An alleged, longtime hitman already serving what essentially is a life sentence in a Louisiana prison now claims that he was the trigger-man in an infamous 1984 murder that was the basis for the 1989 true crime novel Blind Faith - a murder for which he already has been tried and found not guilty.

But that's just the tip of the alleged iceberg for 71-year-old Larry Thompson Sr. - he also has been indicted in the 1979 murder of Deanna Montgomery, of Shreveport, and indictments also are expected in the murders of two other people in two other jurisdictions, one also in Louisiana and one in Texas.

Montgomery's husband, Jim - a longtime friend of Thompson's - also was indicted this week in the murder of his wife and charged with second-degree murder.

Thompson's current prison sentence is for crimes unrelated to the three murders - and because he already has been found not guilty of murdering New Jersey socialite Maria Marshall, he can't be tried again for her murder.

Marshall was found shot to death on the side of the Garden State Parkway in New Jersey on September 7, 1984.

Despite being identified during his trial as the trigger man, Thompson was found not guilty of the murder.

Marshall's husband, Robert Marshall, however, was found guilty of arranging the murder of his wife and was sentenced to death - although, that sentence was overturned in 2004 and he was re-sentenced to 30 years to life in prison. He remains in a New Jersey prison.

Thompson's confession to the murder comes as investigators have started to take a fresh look at a handful of different unsolved homicides in multiple states. The two other unsolved murders in which authorities suspect Thompson are those of Larry Wayne Lester in DeSoto Parish, Louisiana, in 1988, and the 1979 murder of Chester Underwood in Harrison County, Texas.

Authorities are being rather tight-lipped about their overlapping investigations, but law enforcement officials think time is beginning to catch up to the confessed killer and he is beginning to come clean about the murders he's long been suspected of committing.

'Larry was a notorious criminal. He was feared. Nobody ever testified 
against Larry Thompson,' Robert Davidson, a retired DeSoto Parish 
sheriff’s lieutenant who continues to work on area cold cases, tells the Shreveport Times. 'Testifying against Larry Thompson was like testifying against the drug 
cartel.'

Authorities believe Thompson could be tied to several more murders, and hope that now that he is behind bars, witnesses who may have previously been scared to testify against the longtime criminal might start coming forward.

In many of the cold cases, Thompson was initially considered a suspect. But authorities had a hard time getting charges to stick. But many of the detectives who worked the cases three decades ago never forgot about Thompson's alleged victims.

'It just goes to show you, sometimes the family gives up hope. But every
 case in time, just like the one here in DeSoto that happened in 1988, 
will have leads still out there,' DeSoto Parish Sheriff Rodney Arbuckle told the paper. 'This investigation has
 been going on for more than a year and I know sometimes the family 
thinks law enforcement has forgotten them but anytime we get a lead we 
are going to run with it to see how far it goes.'

Thompson currently is serving a 50-plus year sentence for a botched, 2003 armored car robbery.

Thompson and five other thieves - including Thompson's son Larry Thompson Jr. - were arrested following a dramatic chase through a neighborhood in Bossier City. The failed robbery and the chase that followed left one Shreveport police officer wounded. 

Prosecutors recently began interviewing Thompson about some of the murders he's been suspected of committing over the years as he sits in Louisiana's infamous Angola Prison, where he is now in the 12th year of what essentially is a life sentence for the aging thug.

During one of these interviews, Thompson admitted to murdering Marshall, and told Caddo Parish Assistant District Attorney J. Ford McWilliams that his son had provided a false alibi for him during his initial trial.

'Not only did he say he was in New Jersey on Sept. 6-8, 1984, he also 
stated that it was he who fired the shots that caused Maria Marshall’s 
death,' Ocean County prosecutor Joseph Coronato said.

However, he will never be charged with her murder.

'Though there are no legal avenues we can pursue at this time because 
our laws preclude further prosecution and substantial time has lapsed 
since the event occurred, we felt it was important we publicize these 
developments so that the family and friends of Maria Marshall could find
 some degree of closure to this tragic event,' Coronato said.
