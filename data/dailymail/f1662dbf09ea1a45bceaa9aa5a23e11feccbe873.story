Dozens of flights were cancelled this morning at London Heathrow as the world’s third busiest airport was engulfed by thick fog.

Some 85 flights at the five-terminal airport in West London were axed and there were delays to other departures and arrivals.

Fog also caused disruption at Cardiff Airport. In addition, problems were reported at Land's End, Manchester and Edinburgh airports due to low visibility.

It came as Government experts warned people in Britain to be braced for ‘very high’ levels of air pollution over the next few days.

The East of England and Midlands are the worst-affected areas today but large swathes of England and Wales will see high levels of pollution tomorrow.

Up we go: An aircraft is surrounded by fog as it takes off at London Heathrow Airport. The Met Office has issued a pollution warning of 10 out of 10 for today and tomorrow

Arrival: An aircraft is surrounded by fog as it comes in for landing at Heathrow Airport in south-west London

Delays and disruption: Planes take off and land in fog at Heathrow Airport in West London, as heavy fog covers many parts of the South East

Misery: Passengers queue in Terminal 5 to re-book their flights after fog has led to delays and cancellations at Heathrow Airport, west London

It has been caused by a combination of
 light south-easterly winds, the continental air flow and dust which has
 blown up from the Sahara desert.

The
 Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs’s pollution forecast
 said north-west Norfolk should experience ‘very high’ air pollution.

Other
 parts of East Anglia will experience ‘high’ levels and parts of 
south-east England and the Humber region will experience ‘moderate’ 
pollution.

However, tomorrow experts are anticipating ‘high’ or ‘very high’ air pollution levels across much of England and Wales.

TRAINS

But the air pollution is expected to ebb away by Friday. Last weekend, some people found their cars to be covered in a light coating of red dust.

The Met Office said that a large amount of sand and dust was swept up by storm winds in the Sahara Desert.

Experts
 said that the airborne particles of dust were blown north to the UK 
where they combined with our warm air and were deposited during showers.

Meanwhile a woman and her dog had to be rescued by the Solent Coastguard after becoming cut off by the rising tide in thick fog.

The
 woman's husband called 999 at 8am, reporting that his wife was cut off 
and in a distressed state on Appley Beach in Ryde, Isle of Wight.

The
 woman was contacted on her mobile phone but she was already up to her 
waist in the water and disorientated as to her precise whereabouts.

Britain was covered in fog this morning as the country prepared for 
another warm spring day with maximum temperatures of 20C.

The
 fog and low cloud seen this morning will thin and break to allow for 
sunny periods, although North Sea coasts may see fog linger throughout.

It will become warm inland, while the south coast remains cooler with an onshore breeze, and the warmest part of the UK is expected to be London.

Later in the day today, a few showers 
will push into the south-west and Northern Ireland with the risk of a 
few rumbles of thunder.

The 
Met Office has forecast a ten out of ten level of air pollution for 
London for today and tomorrow, warning of one of the worst smogs of the 
year.

Forecast: Tomorrow and Thursday, heavy showers or longer spells of rain will push north across western parts of the UK, with the risk of isolated thunderstorms

Walking through: A foggy morning at Ravenscourt Park in Hammersmith, west London, as the capital was shrouded in heavy fog

Eerie: A commuter walks across Ravenscourt Park in Hammersmith, west London, ahead of a day in the capital that was expected to see 20C temperatures

Blue skies: A foggy start over Hyde Park in Central London, ahead of what promises to be another warm spring day in the capital

Starting out: Low-level smog during sunrise over Tower Bridge and the River Thames in London. High levels of pollution and poor air quality are forecast

TODAY

TOMORROW

THURSDAY

People with lung problems and the elderly have been advised to avoid strenuous exercise - and healthy adults told to reduce exertion outdoors.

Tomorrow
 and Thursday, heavy showers or longer spells of rain will push north 
across western parts of the UK, with the risk of isolated thunderstorms.

It 
will be largely fine and warm elsewhere on those two days, with high 
temperatures of 21C in London, but foggy and cool around North Sea 
coasts.

Friday will see 
cloudy conditions with outbreaks of rain clearing, then becoming dry and
 brighter, while there will be a dry start on Saturday before rain.

Temperatures climbed to a summery 
20.9C (69.6F) in St James’s Park in Central London on Sunday, which was 
the hottest day of the year so far.

That
 temperature was matched on Sunday in Santon Downham, Norfolk. The 
previous high this year was 20.5C (68.9F) in Gravesend, Kent, on March 
9.

The balmy spell is 
driven by tropical winds arriving from Africa, making temperatures 
across the UK higher than average for this time of year.

In
 late March 2013, Britain was shivering in snow and temperatures of 
minus 10C (14F). There were 4ft drifts in the North and 20,000 homes 
lost power.
