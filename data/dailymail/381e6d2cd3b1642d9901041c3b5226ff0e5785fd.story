A painting by artist Gustav Klimt that has gone unseen for 100 years is expected to fetch up to £8million when it goes on auction later this month.

Seeufer mit Birken (Lakeshore with Birches) has been missing since it was bought in Dusseldorf, Germany, in 1902 by the collectors Richard and Klara Koenigs-Bunge.

The following year they gave the work to their daughter Martha as a wedding present and it has remained in the family ever since.

Unseen for 100 years: Artist Gustav Klimt's rediscovered work Seeufer mit Birken (Lakeshore with Birches) is exhibited by Sotheby's employees in London yesterday

Painter: Austrian artist Gustav Klimt was born in 1862 and died in 1918

The painting was yesterday unveiled for the first time in a century at Sotheby's auction house in London.

It goes on sale as part of Sotheby's 
Impressionist and Modern Art Evening Sale next week, when it is expected
to fetch between £6million and £8million.

Sotheby's Helena Newman said: 'We are
absolutely delighted to offer this exquisite work by the artist which 
not only appears for the first time at auction, but represents a 
discovery of great significance in the artist's oeuvre.'

In 1901, Klimt worked on a series of landscapes including one of a group of trees in a sun-lit field beside a lake.

Seeufer mit Birken was painted while 
Klimt was on holiday on the Attersee in the Viennese countryside, where 
the artist would escape to from the city every summer from 1899.

Other highlights include Joan Miró’s 
1933 work Peinture; a rare and atmospheric winter scene by Claude Monet,
L’entrée de Giverny en hiver; and one of Fernand Léger’s definitive 
compositions of the 1940s, La Jeune fille à l'échelle.

The auction also features works by 
Salvador Dalí, Giorgio de Chirico, Max Ernst, Yves Tanguy and René 
Magritte, as well as a group of paintings by German artists including 
Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Emil Nolde, Lyonel Feininger and Otto Dix.
