A father-of-two ordered enough ricin to 'kill hundreds' from an undercover FBI agent on the 'dark net' it is alleged.

Mohammed Ammer Ali, 31, asked for the chemical to be delivered to his family home hidden in a toy car.

Ali was said to have then searched the internet looking for local pet shops selling rabbits and chinchillas on which he could test the deadly poison.

Hidden: Enough ricin to 'kill hundreds' was concealed in a toy car

He was arrested in an anti-terror raid at his home in Liverpool last week, accused of paying $500 (£325) for 500mg of ricin.

Ali told the FBI agent, posing as a seller, that he would be a 'good repeat customer' and would 'need 500mg each month, for the next few months', according to investigators.

He is said to have asked if the ricin would be packaged in 'Breaking Bad style' phials – referring to the hit US drama. Terror police, who raided his top-floor flat above a restaurant, also allegedly found a 'to-do list' saved on his computer which said 'pay ricin man' and 'get pet to murder'. The married IT worker appeared at a London court yesterday charged with attempting to obtain a chemical weapon.

Speaking at the hearing in Westminster Magistrates' Court, prosecutor Mark Dawson said of the amount of ricin ordered: 'Whether inhaled or injected, the chemical would easily be enough to scientifically kill hundreds of people.

'He believed he was purchasing five fatal doses.'

The poison is 6,000 times more deadly than cyanide.

Ali was caught in an FBI sting, with the help of British counter-terrorism police, after he allegedly accessed online marketplaces in the so-called 'dark net' – the hard-to-access parts of the internet used by those engaging in criminal activity. According to investigators, the father had initiated contact with the 'seller' on January 11 asking for ricin to be sent to the UK. 

In court: Mohammed Ammer Ali, 31, of Liverpool, arrived in London and is accused of trying to buy $500 of ricin from a website in the United States using internet currency Bitcoins

When he was given the prices which the FBI said was $200 (£130) per lethal dose, the buyer, which the prosecutor says is Ali, replied: 'Could you do it a little cheaper if I bought more?'

Before adding: 'How would one test if it is actually ricin, other than the obvious of course :)'

Ali then allegedly asked for 500mg for $500 which needed to be split into 'multiple dosages' and would be 'used indoors'.

'I will be a very good repeat customer if you can make this possible and im (sic) happy with the results,' he added, according to a transcript.

After the agent, who described his product as 'some really nasty sh*t', suggested Ali use a rodent to test a small amount of the ricin on, he allegedly replied: 'I like the rodent test … thanks for that.'

Appearance: Ali, wearing a blue jumper and blue trousers in court, spoke in a strong Liverpudlian accent  to confirm his name and address. He did not enter plea/ 

He is said to have revealed very little about his alleged targets but inquired about whether or not the ricin would still work if mixed in water or food.

Excited about receiving the toxic chemical in tiny battery sized 100mg phials, he allegedly wrote to the undercover agent asking: 'Are we talking Breaking Bad style? Let's make this happen.'

He is accused of buying the ricin in February using online currency Bitcoin.

Ali, who has two children aged four and six, then allegedly arranged for it to be delivered to his home address in the name 'Dylan Harvey'.

The FBI had concealed the five phials containing a harmless powder in the battery compartment of the yellow remote control car.

Ali's wife, who is originally from Pakistan, is said to have accepted the delivery on February 10 before armed officers arrested him the following morning during raids of five properties in Liverpool – including his home, former home and a local IT firm.

No pleas were taken during the hearing in London. Ali was remanded in custody to appear at the Old Bailey on March 13.

Police have stressed officers have currently uncovered no plan or threat of an imminent attack.
