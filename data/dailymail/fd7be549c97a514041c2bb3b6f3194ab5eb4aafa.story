A father is suing his son's high school track coach because the teenager didn't make the team.

Ervin Mears Jr. filed a lawsuit asking for $40million on behalf of his 16-year-old son Mawusimensah, as well as the varsity letters and championship jackets for the past two seasons.

'Children have rights, just like any adult,' Mr Mears told The Philadelphia Inquirer.

Standing their ground: Ervin Mears Jr. (left) filed a $40million lawsuit because his son Mawusimensah was kicked off of his high school's track team even though he was one of the quickest runners

Mawusimensah was kicked off the Sterling Regional High School team in Somerdale, New Jersey, and the school says it was because of unexcused absences.

Mr Mears contradicts that, saying that his son had a leg injury and a death in the family that caused him to miss certain practices.

Instead, he said that the falling out with the coach after he would not put him in the events he was best suited for.

The school did not comment on the matter because of the ongoing legal action.

Mr Mears did not name the coach as the only plaintiff in the lawsuit, as he also included the school athletic director, the principal, as well as the school superintendent and the members of the school board.

He would not specify how exactly the came to the asking amount of $40million for the lawsuit, though it is clear that they are concerned with Mawusimensah's career.Â 

Mr Mears said that his son was the 'undefeated champ' in the middle school 200-, 400-, and 800- runs at his Catholic school in eighth grade.

Then when he went on to Sterling Regional High School, the coach reportedly did not allow him to run those races, but not because he was slow, rather showing partiality towards older students.

No comment: The coach and all employees of the school would not release a statement because of the ongoing legal drama

Defense: The school says that the son had unexcused absences from practice, but his father said it was because of an injury and a death in the family

'If he doesn't qualify, then the clock will say he's not fast enough,' Mr Mears told The Inquirer.

Mr Mears, who is a disabled veteran who was also a runner in his youth, believes that his son's lack of exposure will hurt him when it comes time to seeking a college athletic scholarship.

Aside from that, the suit is based around the charge that Mawusimensah was bullied and harassed as a result of his failure to make the team.

'I felt in a way, disrespected,' Mawusimensah told The Philadelphia Inquirer.

'At practice, I work hard and I try to be the best athlete I can be, but at meet time, I didn't get the respect that I thought I deserved.'

Even without Mawusimensah, the team did fine on their own having won the track Sectionals this season with the help of some athletes still on the team.
