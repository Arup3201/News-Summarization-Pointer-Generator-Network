Sir Michael Wilshaw, chief of Ofsted, said children are not being taught the basic skills needed to survive in the workplace

Millions of youngsters are too sloppy and slovenly to get jobs because they lack the discipline or skills needed for work, the chief inspector of schools said yesterday.

School and college leavers are careless about time, lack a work ethic, do not dress or speak well and are lackadaisical, Sir Michael Wilshaw added in his scathing remarks.

Employers think teenagers and those in their early 20s have never been taught how to behave and work or about the attitude they need to get on, he continued.

Sir Michael, head of Ofsted, made his attack as the inspectorate published a highly critical report on the quality of  further education and sixth-form teaching for 16 to 19-year-olds.

In particular, it savaged English and maths teaching, and failures in the way young people are guided towards careers.

The report said there was no point in keeping young people in education until 18 if they did not gain qualifications or were not prepared for the demands of work.

‘Many employers complain that far too many young people looking for work have not been taught the skills, attitudes and behaviours they need to be  successful,’ Sir Michael warned.

‘It means they have a sloppy  attitude to punctuality. It means they are far too relaxed in terms of meeting deadlines. It means that far too many young people are  lackadaisical in the way they present themselves for work. 

‘If they dress inappropriately, speak inappropriately and have poor social skills, they are not going to get a job.

‘Youth unemployment is far too high and it is in everyone’s interest that young people receive the very best education and training to improve this situation.’

His verdict came a day after an analysis by the wealthy nations grouping, the Organisation for  Economic Co-operation and Development, said only a quarter of  British graduates scored well in maths and English tests.

This was 
well below standards achieved at universities in rival countries. OECD 
officials said in Japan, the top-rated country, foundations for good 
language and maths skills were laid in schools but that is ‘not true for
 the UK’.

Sir
 Michael said at the launch of the Ofsted report: ‘The gap between the 
good intentions of  policy and the reality of what is happening is 
worryingly wide.’

Mr
 Wilshaw said career advice being given to children was often not up to 
scratch, and did not include good work experience to prepare them for 
the world of work

He added that too many teenagers drop out of post-16 education and disappear from the system, and too few get a chance of useful work experience.

‘Too few young people know what they want to do at 18 because the quality of careers guidance is shockingly poor,’ Sir Michael went on.

‘Too few students make sufficient progress in improving their English and maths because the teaching is simply not good enough.

‘Again, it is quite shocking that 84 per cent of youngsters who don’t get the GCSE at grade C in  English and maths at 16 fail again at 19.’ His remarks reflect the  long-standing despair felt by many employers.

As a result of Labour’s 2008 Education and Skills Act, the school leaving age was raised from 16. By last year all teenagers had to stay on in education or training to 17. Next year, they cannot leave education or training until aged 18.

Just under 1.18million young people aged 16 to 24 count as NEETS – not in employment, education or training. Yesterday’s report said too few schools and colleges had taken advantage of new ways to fund courses to boost standards.

‘Too much teaching in English and maths is not good enough as not enough learners are making sufficient progress in developing their reading, writing, oral  communication and mathematical skills,’ it warned.

‘There is a shortage of good  teachers of English and, in  particular, mathematics.’A spokesman at the Department for Education responded: ‘The number of young people NEET is at its lowest level since consistent records began.

‘We have scrapped thousands of low-quality qualifications so that only the gold-standard, employer-valued courses remain.

‘And providers are now incentivised to ensure young people study valuable courses.’
