David Cameron today signalled that he will protect benefits for Britain’s wealthiest pensioners.

The Prime Minister insisted there were not big savings to be made from cutting winter fuel payments, TV licences and bus passes for the well-off.

It raises the prospect of the Tories being the only major party going into the election vowing to preserve the payments for all over-65s, while cutting welfare for people of working age.

Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured today, gave his clearest signal yet that he will repeat his 2010 pledge to protect pensioner benefits, saying it was a matter of 'fairness' to ensure handouts continue for over-65s

Mr Cameron promised before the 2010 election that voters could ‘read my lips’ as he vowed all pensioner benefits would continue.

Lib Dem Deputy PM Nick Clegg has branded the pledge ‘completely irrational’ and said he would be ‘gobsmacked’ if Mr Cameron repeated the promise in the Tory manifesto in 2015.

Senior Conservatives including Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith had been urging the Prime Minister to ditch the pledge for the next election.

But Mr Cameron today suggested that he would repeat the promise for the next five years, in a direct pitch to older people who are more likely to vote.

He told BBC Radio4’s Today programme: ‘I made a very clear at the last election that we would keep pensioner benefits and we have kept that promise, we have kept those benefits.

‘We’ll set out our plans for that specific area closer to the election. I’ve always said that there aren’t huge savings to be made from axing these benefits and I think pensioners welcome the clarity that there has been.’

Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg and Labour's Ed Miliband have both promise to reduce benefits for well-off pensioners if they get into power after the election on May 7

FREE BUS PASS

What is it? By law those over 62 get a free bus pass for off-peak travel, although the age will rise to 66 by 2020. Local authorities can extend it to others if they want to. The over-60s get one in London. 

WINTER FUEL PAYMENT

What is it? Those born on or before July 5, 1952, are entitled to £200 when the cold weather sets in. Those over 80 receive £300. Most payments were made in November and December.

FREE TV LICENCE

What is it? The over-75s are entitled to a free television licence worth £145.50 for a colour set and £49.00 for a black and white TV.

How can you hand it back? Unclear. Pensioners initially have to apply for the free licence online or at a post office. But once it has been set up the authorities keep handing out a free licence every three years to all recipients with a National Insurance number. 

He said protecting extra benefits for pensioners was key to ensuring fairness in Britain.

‘This country has had to make difficult long term decisions. We have had to work through a plan to get our deficit down and live within out means

‘I don’t think it would be fair to ask pensioners to make the biggest adjustment. Because when you are a pensioner it’s more difficult to adjust your circumstances and that’s why we made the commitment that the pension would always go up by earnings or prices or by 2.5 per cent, the so-called triple lock.

‘And as a result a pensioner today has £800 more through their pension than they did when I become prime minister.

‘I think that was the right commitment to make because dignity and security in old age should be part of the promise we make to people in our country.’

The Lib Dems blocked any further welfare reform I the current coalition unless Mr Cameron agreed to axe the £2billion in benefits to the better off, including the winter fuel allowance, free bus passes and free TV licences.

Labour has said it will stop winter fuel payments to 600,000 pensioners on higher and top-rate tax.

The Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned taxpayers will have to find another £12billion by the end of the decade to pay for benefits for pensioners.

Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said today: 'We have said we will have some difficult decisions to get the deficit down. 

'We would reverse the top rate income tax rate cuts which the Tories delivered for people earning over £150,000, but we’ve also said that we would have to take the winter allowance from the richest pensioners, pensioners with pensions over £42,000-a-year. 

'That is the kind of tough choice which we are making which the Conservatives aren’t making, as we saw from David Cameron today.'

Tens of thousands of families where no one works will have their benefits slashed, David Cameron is to pledge today.

The current £26,000 cap would be cut to £23,000 within days of the Tories winning the general election, the Prime Minister will say.

As the campaign enters its final 100 days with two polls showing his party has moved into a narrow lead, Mr Cameron is also promising tax relief for the middle classes.

Reducing the welfare cap by £3,000 to £23,000 – equivalent to a pre-tax salary of around £29,300 – would hit an additional 70,000 workless households and save taxpayers an extra £135million per year (file picture)

He is determined to ensure welfare is no longer a 'lifestyle choice', while rewarding those who are in work. He will pledge that the Conservatives would reduce the limit on handouts to jobless families within a week of being re-elected.

Housing benefit would be removed from jobless 18 to 21-year-olds, meaning they will have to live with their parents like millions of youngsters starting out in a job. 

The new cuts would squeeze the incomes of 100,000 jobless households and raise money to be ploughed into apprenticeships for three million school leavers. 

The Coalition has already introduced a welfare cap of £26,000 per household in what polls suggest is one of its most popular policies. However, further welfare cuts have been hampered by Liberal Democrat opposition.

Reducing the cap to £23,000 – equivalent to a pre-tax salary of around £29,300 – would hit an additional 70,000 workless households and save taxpayers an extra £135million per year, while the housing benefit squeeze on younger jobseekers would apply to 30,000 claimants and save a further £120million.

Only claimants of Disability Living Allowance would be exempt from the new cap.

The Prime Minister and Chancellor George Osborne visited Hecks Cider Farm in Street, Somerset, today

Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves said: 'Labour supports a cap on benefits. We will ask an independent commission to look at whether the cap should be lower in some areas.

'But David Cameron can't hide from the fact that his government has spent GBP25 billion more than planned on welfare because of his failure to tackle the low pay that leaves millions dependent on benefits to make ends meet.

'And nobody will believe promises on apprenticeships from a government that had seen the number of apprenticeships for young people fall.'
