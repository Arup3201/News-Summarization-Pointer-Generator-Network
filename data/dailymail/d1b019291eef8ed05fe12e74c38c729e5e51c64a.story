The most controversial picture shows her posing topless with a cherry in her mouth while holding a gun in one hand.

In another, she can be seen lying down with McDonald's burgers covering her breasts. In another  she poses naked with sushi on her breasts and an octopus covering her lower body.

Speaking to the Herald On Sunday, New Zealand fashion photographer Chris Sisarich said she clearly has talent.

But he admitted her work was bold 'considering her background’ and that she was opening herself up for criticism.

‘I think New Zealanders can be quite harsh and judgmental. Her value as an artist I think will be affected by the fact that her dad is the PM,' he said

Her sushi picture will be used to promote her college's exhibition at Paris Design Week, starting on September 9.

She is one of only six students with work featured in the promotional material.
