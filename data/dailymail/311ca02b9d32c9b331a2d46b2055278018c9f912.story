A wife who was filmed by her husband having a temper tantrum in their car has hit back at her partner and said she is filing for divorce after just 14 months of marriage.

The video of Whitney Mongiat, 30, kicking and screaming in the front seat of the car after her husband said he can't take her to the lake on a hot Saturday, has been seen across the world after it went viral this week.

Husband James said he recorded the scene in Nashville, Tennessee, so he could show the world what he had to go through. His wife has now offered her side of the story, claiming she felt like she was being bullied during their short marriage.

Speaking to RightThisMinute.com,
 Whitney, who works as a nurse, said her husband had promised to take 
her to the lake with some friends, but he changed his mind after they 
got into an argument.

She said her breakdown was caused by him egging her on and that she felt like she was being bullied.

According to the website, she also said she felt embarrassed as friends, family and co-workers had seen the video.

James meanwhile has stood by his claim that her actions were an 'ongoing thing,' causing the disintegration of their marriage after only 14 months.

The couple was married last year, in May, in a beautiful outdoor ceremony in Knoxville, TN., surrounded by family and friends. Pictures from the day showing a happy couple with ear to ear grins. There was no indication the marriage soon end.

He said she wanted to go to the lake, but he was unable to do so because he had chores to carry out.

He also told the site he had no regrets about posting the video online and his friends had supported his actions.

In the original caption when he posted
 the video online, James wrote his wife became enraged when he ruled 
that they could not spend 
their Saturday on the nearby lake because he had to get his truck fixed.

Amid Whitney's piercing 
scream, Jim covertly films her with a small recorder and he is heard 
explaining the reasons why they cannot spend the day on the water.

'It's my day to get sh** done too, and you're acting like an 11-year-old who didn't get the toy from Wal-mart,' he said.

Meanwhile, she says: 'You have to stop and get me some cigarettes! I'm about to go crazy!'

'I never get my way! I just want one day when I get my way- ONE DAY!'

The
 video was originally posted to Youtube but then it was removed by site 
administrators saying that it was 'a violation of YouTube's policy 
prohibiting content designed to harass, bully or threaten'.

Before
 it was taken down, Jim used the comments section to clarify some of the
 finer points of both the spat and the marital situation.

'I had worked 60 hours that week and 
told her all week that Saturday was my day to get stuff done around the 
house. But as usual she threw a fit about it,' he wrote according to Gawker.

'That was the last day I lived in our house. I have moved out and filed a restraining order against her.'

Jim said he knew his wife accepted it was over when 
she de-friended him on Facebook.
