A note had been attached to a parcel containing a bomb that killed a retired Tennessee attorney and gravely injured his wife Monday, it was revealed today. 

Jon Setzer, 74, was pronounced dead from his injuries at the scene and 72-year-old Marion Setzer was in critical condition at Vanderbilt University Hospital, police said.

Tennessee Bureau of Investigation officials declined to say what kind of parcel was sent to the couple’s Lebanon home.

Targets: Jon Setzer, 74, died in the blast and his wife Marion Setzer, 72, is in critical condition

CNN reported Wednesday that the letter was discovered inside the home of the Setzer couple following the deadly blast. The contents of the note have not been revealed.

Investigators
 are still trying to determine how the parcel was delivered to the home.
 They are also looking into Mr Setzer's past to see if he had been 
involved in any disputes over the course of his career as a bankruptcy lawyer. 

'It doesn't make sense at all,' family friend Ken Caldwell told he station WTVF. 'When I've heard it said that it was targeted, I thought, well, they must have targeted the wrong person.'

Setzer's former law partner, George Cate Jr, described his slain friend as a dedicated professional who in his spare time served as a pastor at several country churches.

Cate, who first met Setzer when the two of them served in the Army Reserve, revealed that he and his wife had lost their son in a dog attack when the child was only 3 years old.

In the years that followed, whenever the Setzers heard a news report about a child's death, they would reach out to the victim’s family to commiserate with them and offer them emotional support.

Cate and Jon Setzer opened a law firm together in 1979, with the late attorney specializing in living trusts.

Mr Setzer retired in the early 1990s due to growing health problems.

Tennessee Bureau of Investigation Officials would not say what kind of parcel was sent to the Setzer residence

Along with the TBI, agents from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, were investigating at the home on a rural cul-de-sac.

Official vehicles filled the yard of the red brick two-story home with white dormers Tuesday.

‘We will be here night and day trying to come to the quickest resolution to this issue as we can,’ Tennessee Bureau of Investigation Director Mark Gwyn said.

Earlier, alcohol bureau spokesman Michael Knight said investigators had ruled out accidental causes like gas leak or electrical malfunction. Later authorities confirmed it was a package, but would not speculate on a possible motive behind the attack.

Shocking incident: A neighbor said Setzer and his wife had gone to the mailbox to retrieve a package at and returned to the house when the blast went off

According to a neighbor speaking to WZTV, Setzer and his wife had gone to the mailbox to retrieve a package at around 5pm Monday and returned to the house when the blast went off.

The impact blew out windows and several rooms were damaged in their house located in the 500 block of Vance Lane just outside city limits.

First responders who arrived on the scene pronounced Mr Setzer dead. The Lebanon Democrat reported that his wife was transported by a medical helicopter to Vanderbilt University Hospital for treatment. 

This afternoon, police announced an $8,000 reward for information that leads to a conviction in the case.

Neighbors said the couple was friendly and sometimes looked after other people’s pets when they went out of town.

David Hughen arrived at his house about an hour after the blast Monday, and noticed that the front and back windows of the Setzer home had been shattered.

‘With the house as well-built as it was, it had to be a huge explosion,’ Hughen said of the home built four years ago. ‘It's just a huge mystery that a terrible thing has happened to good people.’

Crews in white hazardous materials suits were walking around the property on Tuesday.

Another neighbor, Charles Thompson, said the blast in the small neighborhood has left him shaken.

‘It didn't appear that they were the kind of people this would happen to,’ Thompson said. ‘It's very scary.’

In a release, TBI officials asked residents to remain vigilant and contact police if they locate any suspicious packages.

Records show Jon Setzer was a retired lawyer who specialized in bankruptcy cases.  State court system and bar association records show no public disciplinary actions against the victim.
