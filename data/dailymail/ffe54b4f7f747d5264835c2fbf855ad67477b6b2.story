Kimberley Walsh has revealed a rather spiritual side ahead of the birth of her first child, due any day now.

The former Girls Aloud singer has been preparing by attending couples yoga with long-term boyfriend Justin Scott to 'get in the right mindset' for the impending delivery.

Speaking to MailOnline, the 32-year-old said: 'I've been doing pilates and yoga to keep active and stay strong. Pilates helps keep everything in line and yoga is great for getting into the right mindset and headspace for labour. Justin and I have been doing it together to prepare.'

The glamorous Northerner said she is most looking forward to having some time off from her hectic schedule to relax and enjoy time with her newborn.

'It's the one time in my life where I can take time out and not plan. I'm looking forward to a chilled few months with the family in the run up to Christmas where I can just get cosy at home,' she said. 

But the ambitious star, who has been in the showbiz industry for over a decade, is already planning her return to work.

'In the New Year, maybe I'll start to edge back into work. That's the beauty of my job, I can do the odd day here and there but I don't have any commitments and just want to enjoy the baby.'

Kimberley, who recently celebrated her baby shower with close friends Nicola Roberts and Kara Tointon at Nether Winchendon House in Buckinghamshire, is also looking forward to watching best friend Cheryl Fernandez-Versini on the X Factor this autumn.

'I can't wait! It will be nice to have something to watch on the weekends when I'm not partying. I'm also really looking forward to watching Strictly.' 

For now, the singer is cramming in the work commitments,her latest being the face of Specsavers' Love Glasses campaign and the associated Spectacle Wearer of the Year awards in support of the anti-bullying charity Kidscape. 

Not long now! Kimberley is due to give birth any day now and says she can't wait to take some time off and chill out with her newborn

How do you wear yours? Kimberley said it's important to have fun with your glasses and admits that her style has changed since becoming pregnant but she will be back in the bodycon dresses next year

Big chill: The Northerner, who shot to fame with Girl's Aloud over a decade ago, said she's most looking forward to having some time off from her hectic schedule to relax and enjoy time with her newborn

'My new campaign is a win-win situation because it is raising awareness for a great cause and I want children to feel good about wearing glasses; don't shy away from them,' she said. 

Sharing her advice for styling out glasses in style, Kimberley said: 'I love a strong pair of glasses and love teaming it with whatever outfit I'm wearing - just have fun with it.'

The star also opened up about her maternity style saying: 'My style has inevitably changed now I'm pregnant and with a huge bump, it is impossible not to shake up my style.

'I am just grateful to find anything that fits and as my pre-baby bodyshape lends itself to bodycon, tight dresses because I have a small waist, I will go back to my old wardrobe after giving birth.'
