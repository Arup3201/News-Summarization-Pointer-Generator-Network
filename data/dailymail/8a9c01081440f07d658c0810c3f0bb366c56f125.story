Ex-Lib Dem leader Paddy Ashdown has spoken of being caught up in a car crash in which a man died

Former Lib Dem leader Paddy Ashdown and his wife have been involved in a three-car collision which left another driver dead.

The 72-year-old peer and his wife Jane have spoken of their devastation at the crash on a notorious accident black spot near their Somerset home.

It is thought a Vauxhall Corsa driven by Mark Hurford clipped the Ashdowns' Renault Scenic as it came round a corner.

Both the peer and his wife walked away unscathed but Mr Hurford, who was 49, died at the scene.

Police are appealing for witnesses of the incident to come forward.

Lord Ashdown, of Norton-sub-Hamdon, Somerset, said: 'We were coming back from the station and my wife was driving me home.

'We were about a mile outside Crewkerne and a car came around the corner.

'My wife was in the driver's seat, and miraculously and thankfully she was unhurt.

'However, the young man was dead by the time I reached him.'

The peer added: 'We are very shaken by it, but of course very concerned for the young man's family and wife.

'I have been in touch with his wife and we are devastated for them and send them our prayers and condolences.'

The crash happened just after 5pm on January 24 at Turnpike Cross on the A356, between the A303 and Crewkerne.

Police are looking into the circumstances of the crash and have appealed for witnesses.

However the incident has sparked members of nearby Chiselborough Parish Council to renew their calls for safety measures along the A356.

The road is a notorious accident black-spot and has been the subject of a campaign for safety improvements by local residents.

A 29-year-old passenger in a Transit 
van also involved in the incident was taken to Yeovil District Hospital,
 Somerset, after suffering a dislocated shoulder and back injuries.

Parish councillor Richard O'Neil said accidents occurred almost every week on the road.

Lord Ashdown and wife Jane walked away from the accident which left them 'devastated'

He said: 'We have been campaigning for some time to get road improvements and a speed restriction on the A356 between Crewkerne and the A303.

'About 20 years ago the road was changed from the B3165 to the A356 but very little was done to the road to bring it up to scratch.'

Tributes have been paid online to Mr Hurford, known as 'Hurf', who was from Crewkerne.

Mark Bennett said: 'I can remember like it was yesterday growing up with Hurf. They were great times and he was a top lad. Our memories will last forever and it was a pleasure knowing him.'

Kerry Singer said: 'Rest in peace to a lovely cheeky chap.' Angie Lawrence added: 'It's so very sad, Mark was a good, hard-working lad.'
