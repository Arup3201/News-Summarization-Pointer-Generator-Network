Trial: Vicky Pryce's daughter Georgia Beesley, pictured arriving at Southwark Crown Court, said Chris Huhne told Pryce if she did not take the points, it would be her fault if he lost the election

Vicky Pryce was told it would be ‘her fault’ if her husband lost an election as a result of a driving ban, a court was told yesterday.

Pryce’s eldest daughter, Georgia Beesley, said the economist was ‘angry, upset and felt bullied’ over Chris Huhne’s demands that she take his speeding points on her licence in 2003.

Mrs Beesley, 37, a management consultant, wept as she told how the ambitious Lib Dem politician ‘went on and on’ about the points until her mother gave in.

‘I remember speaking to my mother and she told me that Chris had been caught speeding and he was trying to get her to take the speeding points,’ she said.

‘If he took the points he would have lost his licence. He was very insistent.

'He didn’t want to lose the election.

'He was standing for election and had to travel regularly to Eastleigh.

‘He said to her if she didn’t take them he would not be able to drive, he would lose his licence and it would be her fault if he didn’t get elected.

She was upset, angry and felt bullied and didn’t want to take the points.’

Huhne was elected as the Lib Dem MP for Eastleigh in 2005.

Mrs Beesley, Pryce’s elder daughter from her first marriage, was called to give evidence on her behalf on the fourth day of her trial for perverting the course of justice.

Standing a few yards from Pryce, 59, at Southwark Crown Court, Mrs Beesley said she had moved out of the Clapham family home when the points saga took place.

But she said she still spoke to her mother at least once or twice a week as Pryce struggled to look after two troubled teenage children.

Hearing: Pryce (left) arriving at Southwark Crown Court , where she is standing trial accused of perverting the course of justice. Chris Huhne (pictured right outside court last week) has admitted the same charge

Evidence: Mrs Beesley said she could not remember if her mother asked for advice but said she 'definitely told her that she should not take the points'

She added: ‘Chris was insisting she take the points.

‘He just went on and on and said it 
was not a big deal. He couldn’t understand why she wouldn’t do it. I 
don’t remember if she asked for advice. I definitely told her she should
not take the points.

‘I knew she did sign the form. She 
told me the form came back and it had already been filled in that she 
was the driver. She felt pressurised into signing the form.’

Mrs Beesley
said the decision to sign the form provoked further rows in the family.

She said: ‘It was spoken about after Chris lost his licence anyway. Mum had to drive him whenever he needed driving.

‘A lot of comments were made around 
that time – “I have got to drive you anyway even though I took the 
points”. There was quite a lot of resentment... that she had to do 
something she really did not want to do and the outcome was exactly the 
same.’

Affair: Huhne left Pryce for his aide Carina Trimingham, right; they are pictured outside court this week

Greek-born Pryce admits taking the points for her then husband but claims she is not guilty on the grounds of marital coercion.

Huhne, 58, is preparing for prison 
after he admitted perverting the course of justice on the morning of his
trial. He then stood down as MP.

The trial continues today.

The jury have been told they are likely to be sent out to consider their verdict tomorrow.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
