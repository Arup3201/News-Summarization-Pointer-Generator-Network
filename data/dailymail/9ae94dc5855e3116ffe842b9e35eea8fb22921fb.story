Dick Advocaat has been plotting Sunderland’s survival mission for the past fortnight from him home in Holland.

The new boss has revealed that he was waiting for the Black Cats to sack Gus Poyet and was surprised it did not happen sooner.

Indeed, in the wake of Sunderland’s 4-0 defeat to Aston Villa on Saturday there were reports that Advocaat was set to take over, despite this being some 48 hours before Poyet was dismissed.

Reports in Holland suggest Dick Advocaat was surprised his predecessor Gus Poyet was not sacked sooner

Poyet was sacked after Sunderland were beaten 4-0 at the Stadium of Light by rivals Aston Villa 

Advocaat said John O'Shea (left) will have to play despite not training in the week as the squad is small

The Dutchman said: ‘I expected they would do it (sack Poyet) earlier, but they didn't.

‘Poyet was a coach who is very self-focussed. They were looking for someone with experience, a guy who knows what it's about. For this short time they didn't want to take the risk to get an inexperienced coach.’ Advocaat will take charge of the team for the first time at West Ham tomorrow and, with his new club just one point above the Premier League drop zone, he has revealed his stark message to the players.

‘As I said to the players, it’s quite simple. This is a big, big club – do you want to play in the other league?’ he said.

‘With this club, this stadium, you cannot play in the lower league. I think they realise how important it is. 

Midfield player Sebastian Larsson has also missed training but will be called upon by Advocaat

Advocaat believes Sunderland have a competitive squad when all of their players are fully fit

‘We have nine games to go and are still a point ahead, so we have everything in our own hands.

‘Keeping this team in the league is the most important thing.

‘There is enough quality in this squad to stay up. We have a difficult programme, as do the other teams, but it’s all up to us and I have a good feeling about it.’ Meanwhile, it has been reported that Advocaat is open to the idea of staying at the club beyond the end of the season.

However, it appears some of that was lost in translation from an interview in his homeland and Sportsmail understands he will return to Holland in May.
