Not impressed: Veteran critic Barry Norman wonders what Martians would think after a night on the sofa

He has cast his critical eye over numerous Hollywood turkeys during his distinguished career as a film reviewer.

But none, it would appear, come close to Barry Norman’s dismal verdict on today’s TV adverts.

The 80-year-old veteran critic has launched a wide-ranging attack on the ‘worrisome’ television advertisements currently aimed at viewers, hitting out at everything from the slew of irresponsible gambling and no win, no fee compensation commercials, to a Sky Broadband advert which features young women swooning over older men.

In an amusing but scathing article in this week’s Radio Times, Mr Norman said if aliens were to descend on earth and settle down for a session in front of a TV, they would probably report back to Mars that there is no need to invade judging by the poor quality of adverts.

He said: ‘It’s [TV adverts] full of vain, greedy, irresponsible people constantly looking for a fast buck. Oh, and if we do invade, whatever you do keep away from the young women – trust me, you really don’t want to go near them.’

Speaking in the Radio Times, the veteran critic used the example of recent advertisements for Tena Lights incontinence pads, claiming they humiliated women. He said: ‘Some of the most worrisome ads are on daytime TV.

‘There was the one in which a beautiful young woman in a purple dress gets her skirt caught in the closing doors of a lift and scrabbles desperately to retain her modesty while the man she has just met and fancied looks on with amusement.

‘In a sequel the girl, still wearing the same dress and now accompanied by the fancied man, falls out of a taxi, this time revealing her knickers.

‘Golly, what humiliation but no, hang on, it’s okay – because in both instances beneath those knickers she’s wearing an incontinence pad. She may well have wet herself but, such is the efficacy of the pad, the boyfriend will never know.

‘What puzzles me about all this is the advertiser’s apparent conviction that young women today have absolutely no control over their bladders. If so this is surely a matter of grave concern. These women shouldn’t be buying grown-up nappies; they should be seeking urgent consultations with their GPs.’

Baffling: One advert shows a lady with bladder incontinence fall out of a taxi, flashing her underwear to a date...

...but thanks to this purchase, he will never know. Surely, Norman says, she should really be seeking medical help?

He added: ‘Even more worrying, though, is the proliferation of commercials for personal injury lawyers, again mostly to be found on daytime telly. Oh dear, you fell over in the street while blind drunk and bumped your nose? Well, somebody’s got to pay for that because you’re not responsible, are you? Nobody can be expected to be responsible for their own actions these days.

‘So lose no time in contacting ambulance-chasers’r’us.com and we’ll make sure somebody coughs up compensation. No win, no fee. And the fee if you do win? Ah, that’s not mentioned. Charles Dickens would have had a load of fun with these guys.’

While he admitted that many adverts left him confused and often unsure of what product they were promoting, he said other were more sinister.

Our screens are cluttered with actors falling over as other actors earnestly urge us to demand money

He said: ‘Perhaps most disturbing of all are the gambling commercials, which make betting look glamorous and surely appeal most strongly to the poorest and most desperate among us.

‘There’s one in which a good-looking young couple are so eager to watch the telly and see how to lose all their money that they vault over the back of their settee, the more quickly to study the many ways in which they can gamble their life savings away.

‘Even the BBC gets in on the gambling fever by showing the results of the national lottery at a peak hour, just to remind you that here is yet another, ostensibly more respectable, way to get rid of your money.’

Norman presented BBC1’s Film programme
from 1972 until 1998, when he eventually handed over to Jonathan Ross 
before moving to Sky.

He has
now also admitting to being left ‘bothered’ by a number of other 
adverts, two of which shows a young female apparently aroused by older 
men.

Absurd: Stars like Barbara Windsor are enlisted to star in big-budget commercials promoting gambling

Cashing in: Norman also takes a stab at the BBC for glamorising betting via the Lottery every week

He said: ‘There were the two urging us to subscribe to Sky Broadband that end with either a dressing-gowned Bruce Willis or an equally dressing-gowned Jeff Stelling walking off with a sexually excited girl young enough to be their daughter or even their granddaughter.

‘What’s that all about? Whether it sells much in the way of Sky Broadband I have no idea; the strongest message I receive seems to be that old blokes can still pull young girls but, if you ask me, more fool them if they want to.

‘Then there are the cosmetics ads, particularly those for miracle creams that instantly remove all wrinkles.

‘These end with the models, faces softer and smoother than babies’ bottoms, smiling happily at the camera. Mind you, in most cases they look to be about 19 and might reasonably be supposed not to have had wrinkles in the first place. Nevertheless, once the cream has done its stuff they are unquestionably wrinkle-free.

Honoured: Norman, pictured here with his wife and daughters in 1998, was awarded a CBE for his work

‘I wonder what a visitor from Mars, settling down for a session in front of the telly, would make of all this and of us. I daresay he’d phone home saying: “Look, I don’t think we should bother invading Earth.

‘It’s full of vain, greedy, irresponsible people constantly looking for a fast buck. Oh, and if we do invade, whatever you do keep away from the young women – trust me, you really don’t want to go near them.’

Norman was the face of the BBC’s Film series for more than 20 years. He left in 1998 to become a film critic at Sky, on Barry Norman’s Film Night.  He has also written 10 novels.

He was awarded the BAFTA’s Richard Dimbleby Award in 1980, Magazine Columnist of the Year in 1990 and a CBE in 1998.

He married wife Diana, a former journalist and author, in 1957. The pair had two daughters before she died in 2011 at the age of 77.
