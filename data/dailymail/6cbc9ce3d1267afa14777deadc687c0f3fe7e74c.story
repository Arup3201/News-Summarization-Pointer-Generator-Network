A car enthusiast from Detroit has been reunited with his dream Corvette more than thirty years after it was stolen.

The last time George Talley saw his '79 Chevrolet Corvette was in 1981 as it was parked on Jefferson Avenue, Detroit, before thieves made off with it.

But authorities have tracked it down to Mississippi after noticing a suspect VIN number on the chassis, and it is now waiting at a police station in Hattiesburg.

When George Talley last saw his beloved Chevrolet Corvette (pictured) it was parked in Detroit in 1981 before thieves made off with it

George filed a police report at the time, but thought the car was gone until last week when he got a call to say officers in Mississippi had tracked it down

George told WXYZ Detroit: 'I was sitting at home last Friday looking at Judge Mathis, and I get a call from AAA telling me you have a Corvette in Mississippi, come and get it. And I said, "what?”'

George told reporters that he always liked Corvettes as they were attractive cars and popular with the ladies.

When the car stolen 33 years ago, he filed police report, but after officers found no trace of the vehicle he decided to forget about it.

Now officers in Mississippi say the car still in working order, has only 47,000 miles on the clock, and are asking George to come and collect it.

Speaking about the moment the car was found, George's friend Fred Alexander said: 'It was just exciting, I felt like I was part of finding the car.

Despite some cosmetic damage, Mr Talley's Corvette is running and has just 47,000 miles on the clock

Now George is considering whether to have the car shipped to him, or whether to drive it home

Corvettes registered in 1979 are considered by many to be classic American cars, and can fetch up to $6,000 (£3,500) in good condition with around 50,000 miles.

While images appear to show George's car has suffered since he last saw it, with rusted bodywork and peeling seats, it could be worth a similar amount once repaired.

Now George is considering whether to have the car shipped to him, or whether to take his friends on a roadtrip to go and collect it himself.
