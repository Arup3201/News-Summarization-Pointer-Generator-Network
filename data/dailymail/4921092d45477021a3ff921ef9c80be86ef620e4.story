Matthew Matagrano: The 36-year-old has a lengthy rap sheet that includes a conviction for sodomy. He was jailed today for ten years

It has emerged that the jail-obsessed ex-con who broke into Manhattan Detention Center in February also assaulted and strip-searched an inmate during his bizarre visit.

Matthew Matagrano, 36, impersonated a staff member by flashing a fake gold badge and then pinned an inmate up against a wall, grabbed his testicles and then ordered him into a cell where he made him remove all his clothes.

Matagrano was already facing impersonation charges after blagging his way into the detention center where he spent seven-and-a-half hours with prisoners, handed out cigarettes and llegedly stole $5,000 worth of equipment from security officers.

But now, the inmate has filed a 
complaint against Matagrano, leading to the additional charge of 
burglary as a sexually motivated felony which was filed on July 8th.

After he was exposed, Matagrano admitted his brazen sneaking, but revealed his unusual admiration for correction workers.

'They give me food. They made me feel important,' said 5ft 8in, 340 pound Matagrano.

Norman Seabrook, Correction union president, told the Daily News: 'We’re talking about a serious breach of security.'

Matagrano was able hang around with 
inmates on Rikers Island and the Manhattan Detention Center simply by 
showing a fake shiny gold badge.

Security breach: Most people who've done time on Rikers Island can't wait to get away. Officials say that for at least a week, Matthew Matagrano used a badge and ID card to get into Rikers and roam the jail in February

Matagrano waved his credentials to get into at least five different buildings over the last week.

He allegedly stole $5,000 worth of equipment from security officers and even smoked cigarettes with some of the jail's inmates.

Police
 are only now just putting together a timeline of what happened using 
some of the 24-hour surveillance video gathered from around the 
facilities.

According to the New York Post, on occasion Matagrano was able to access one of the highest-level security wings in the city.

Whilst there he allegedly stole a $2,500 walkie-talke and then strolled around the cells.

On Rikers Island, Matagrano tried to have seven inmates in protective custody moved to the prison’s general population.

Worryingly, he was able to walk around the building and even pass through security checkpoints unhindered.

Matagrano had a legitimate pass to some of the less secure areas of the facility including the car park because he had worked with a non-profit group on the island.

Investigators
 first realised something was amiss when Matagrano was seen in a 
surveillance video walking through various high-level security areas.

Correction
 officers were then put on alert and his disguise was finally rumbled at
 the Bronx Criminal Court after he was caught trying to 'rearrest' an 
inmate.

Security breach: It's not clear why Matagrano wanted to get into the jail, but he had also previously been caught posing as a Board of Education worker to enter schools

It's not the first time Matagrano, who's 340 pounds and 5ft 8in has been caught impersonating staff with fake credentials.

In
 2004 he flashed a Board of Education ID to sneak into an elementary 
school and look through student files. On that occasion he went to jail 
for three years.

His 
criminal history also includes another year behind bars for sodomizing a
 15-year-old boy which lead to him registering as a sex offender for life.
