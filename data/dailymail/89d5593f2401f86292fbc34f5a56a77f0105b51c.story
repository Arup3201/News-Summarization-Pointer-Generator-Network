The lawyer to high-powered activist and adviser Reverend Al Sharpton, who has been accused of rape, was reportedly seen kissing his accuser right before the incident occurred.

Sanford Rubenstein was filmed on a security video making out with the woman who has accused him of rape, and her female friend, in an elevator, according to a source who spoke with the Daily News.

The video was taken as the three were heading up to Rubenstein's penthouse apartment.

Told of the video, Keith White, a lawyer for the Brooklyn mom who accused Rubenstein of rape, insisted, “It’s not true.”  

Earlier this week, Reverend Sharpton blasted his former attorney collaborator in the wake of these accusations.

Sharpton's highly visible move Tuesday to distance himself from Sanford Rubenstein came a day after police combed the 70-year-old civil rights attorney's apartment for evidence that could paint a picture of what happened in the hours after Sharpton's birthday bash Saturday.

Among the potential evidence hauled from Rubenstein's Upper East penthouse on Monday were two bloody condoms and a sex toy.

'Even if it was consensual, why would he take a key leader of our organization back to his apartment right after a fund-raiser,' outraged Sharpton asked the Daily News. 

'It's disrespectful to our movement, and the women in our network are absolutely outraged.'

Sharpton told the News that Rubenstein, who's stood with the reverend at events dating back to 1997, 'has no future' at the National Action Network.

Kenneth Montgomery, one of the accuser's lawyers, told the News: 'She’s fighting to keep her life together, keep her dignity, and not fall apart.'

Neighbors and friends, meanwhile, detailed Rubenstein's seedy lifestyle of frequenting strip clubs and using his limousine to pick up much younger women, according to the New York Post. 

Sanford Rubenstein maintains that he had consensual sex with the 42-year-old retail executive whom he took home after the civil rights leader's birthday party at the Four Seasons last Wednesday. 

He has not been charged with a crime.  

However, the woman has told NYPD detectives that Rubenstein took advantage of her when she was passed out drunk and incapable of telling him no. 

Rubenstein's lawyer Benjamin Brafman issued a statement to MailOnline refusing to comment on the Post's claims, 'even those I know to be patently false.'

He also reiterated an earlier assertion that Rubenstein will be cleared by the police investigation and that he did not commit a crime.

NYPD detectives searched the attorney's $7million penthouse apartment on East 63rd Street in Manhattan on Tuesday and reportedly collected 'biological evidence,' according to the Post.

Cops also hauled away bedding, a mattress and a sex toy.  

The Post, quoting 'sources close to Rubenstein,' alleges a tawdry personal life that revolved around the constant pursuit of sex. 

One source told the newspaper: 'The guy’s hung like a cashew.'

Another said: 'Every time I see him, he wants to tell me about his latest ménage à trois. It’s all about sex with this guy.' 

Neighbors say they often seen the septuagenarian lawyer with young women 'barely out of their teens,' according to the Post. 

One source says the Rubenstein is a regular at strip clubs. He reportedly spent to much time at high-end club Scores that all the strippers greeted him by name when he came in. He also reportedly paid an artist to paint a series of canvasses depicting the club - including a scene showing him getting a rub-down, the Post claims.

He currently haunts at a strip club in Hell's Kitchen that features muscled, tattooed strippers who are black or Hispanic and prefers women who are 5-foot-11 or taller, the Post claims.

Meanwhile, attorneys representing the alleged victim  said Monday they have 'devastating' information about the alleged crime.

Sources familiar with the case have claimed that the 42-year-old woman, who works for Sharpton’s National Action Network, went home with the 70-year-old attorney willingly last week, and even had sex with him a second time the following morning.

But attorney Keith White who represents the alleged victim has challenged these assertions, insisting that a crime had been committed.

‘There’s a lot of new information that will be devastating to Mr. Rubenstein,’ White told New York Daily News. ‘We want to give the district attorney a chance to take this information and do the right thing.‘

White's partner, Kenneth Montgomery, accused Rubenstein and his legal team headed by Benjamin Brafman of trying to 'demonize' his client.

Describing the 42-year-old as a mother and a pillar of the community, Montgomery said her 'world has been turned upside down.' 

Investigators suspect Rubenstein may have used an object to penetrate the 42-year-old woman during the alleged attack in his $7million Manhattan penthouse, making her bleed, sources told the New York Daily News.

The anonymous accusation, which emerged Sunday, is at odds with the source close to Rubenstein, who said the alleged attack that night was in fact consensual, and that more sex followed in the morning. 

The claims came as investigators spent hours searching Rubenstein's apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side for evidence.

On Monday afternoon, police removed a dozen evidence bags, among them one marked 'biological evidence.' They also carried a mattress out of Rubenstein's apartment.

As part of the investigation, police reportedly set up a call between the alleged victim and Rubenstein, during which the woman asked the 70-year-old attorney, 'What happened last night?'

The lawyer replied that they had sex but did not incriminate himself, a police source told the paper.

He has not been charged with anything, though law enforcement  sources suggested to the paper that are considering a third-degree rape charge, which means the victim was incapable of consent.

Rubenstein is a well-known society figure in New York and has fought high-profile cases linked to the National Action Network, often over the actions of the NYPD. 

Sharpton also found himself drawn into commenting on the accusations today, telling a crowd: 'I don't care how close we are - if he's wrong, he's wrong.'

Although he avoided choosing one side over the other, Sharpton said there is 'no place' for the alleged behavior, the New York Post reported. 

He said: 'We do not justify disrespecting women. Doesn’t mean you’re guilty, but it does mean if you are, ain’t no place for that in our community.'

Rubenstein and his alleged victim were both at Sharpton's lavish 60th birthday party at the Four Seasons restaurant before they went home together, along with a third person, who later left.

Other guests at the bash included New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, New York governor Andrew Cuomo, singer Aretha Franklin and director Spike Lee.

A police source described the case as 'a classic he said, she said'. Law enforcement sources also described how Rubenstein was allegedly called by the victim, with police listening in, in an attempt to trick him into describing the encounter.

Defense: Benjamin Brafman has been taken on as Rubenstein's attorney. Above he denies all allegations to waiting reporters

But, the source said, the call passed without incident and Rubenstein simply said that they two of them had sex.

Rubenstein hit back at the claims Monday through a lawyer of his own - top New York attorney Benjamin Brafman.

Brafman spoke to waiting reporters outside Rubenstein's apartment today denying any wrongdoing. He said: 'We do not believe he committed any crime whatsoever and are confident that when the investigation is completed no criminal charges will be filed'. 

The media-savvy Rubenstein currently represents the family of Eric Garner, who died after a police chokehold during an arrest in July. 

The case sparked protests and calls for change within the police department. He also represented the family of Sean Bell, killed in 2008 in a hail of police bullets. The city eventually settled with Bell's family for $7.5million.

Rubenstein is a member of the National Action Network and has often stood arm-in-arm with Sharpton at protests. On Monday, Sharpton met with Garner's family and said he would discuss the Garner investigation at a rally on Saturday.

Sharpton issued a statement on Sunday saying he was aware of the allegations.

'National Action Network and Rev. Al Sharpton has not been notified or advised by any official investigating authorities,' the statement read. 'The allegations as reported occurred at a private residence after a NAN event and had nothing to do with NAN nor Rev. Al Sharpton, therefore we have no comment at this time.'
