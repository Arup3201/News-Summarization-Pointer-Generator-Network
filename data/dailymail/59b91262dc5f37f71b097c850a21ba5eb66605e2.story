She recently appeared in a figure-hugging dress at the premiere for her new film Austenland displaying perfectly toned arms.

The former ballet dancer plays tennis and golf, but says it’s Pilates that has kept her in shape over the years.

She works out several times a week with her Pilates instructor.

What to try: Tricep kickbacks work the muscles in the back of the upper arms.

Stand with one foot in front of the other and a dumb-bell or bottle of water in each hand. Lean forward from the waist and bend your arms to 90 degrees.

Hinge from the elbow to raise the bottles to chest height and then back again. Your upper arms should stay still. Repeat 12-15 times.upidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
