With the weather getting chillier, it can only mean one thing: the ski season is nearly upon us.

And though the sport is one of the most thrilling and exhilarating, the slopes are also quite often the location of numerous social faux pas.

Some of the most common? Failing to keep your speed under control, stopping half-way down the slopes, and voicing an overly condescending attitude about the difficulty (or lack thereof) of the run.

Lucky for us, SkiBoutique has compiled this handy infographic highlighting the main dos and don'ts of the ski season.

Offer to share your chair lift ride with a stranger, refrain from lighting up a cigarette on the hill, and don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it.

Yes, we're looking at you, amateur skiers - there's nothing wrong with signing up for a quick refresher of a lesson before heading out with friends.

Most importantly? Be aware of your surroundings on the mountain and offer to help others when needed. And, of course, have fun!
