The first official photograph of newlyweds Jason Kennedy and Lauren Scruggs has been revealed and shows the adorable couple shortly after they were married during a lavish ceremony in Dallas on Friday evening. 

The photo follows a series of Instagram snaps shared by friends of the couple during and after the ceremony, which took place at the Four Seasons hotel, including one of the duo enjoying a romantic honeymoon in Mexico, which E! News co-host Jason, 33, posted to his account on Sunday evening. 

But this image is the first official image to feature the blushing bride in her strapless lace-embellished wedding dress, which was created especially for her by New York-based designer Romona Keveža.

Group shot! Jason released this picture on Monday, saying 'Best day of my life! Can't wait to share our crazy journey with all of you next Monday night at 8/7c on E!'

To emphasize the ornate detailing on the dress, the 26-year-old bride, appears to have kept the rest of her wedding day look very simple, wearing her hair in loose waves, which were pinned back with a simple white veil.

Jason, 33, also kept his look simple, wearing a dark grey three-piece suit by Tom Ford, accessorizing with a plain black tie and watch. 

Later on in the day, Lauren changed into a second white dress by Dallas-based designer - and close friend - Nardos Imam, which she wore throughout the reception. 

The strapless creation, which featured a large white bow on the back, was the subject of many an Instagram image as guests eagerly started to post their candid snaps from the post-wedding party online.

According to sources at the ceremony, the wedding itself was an incredibly emotional affair.

Earlier this year, the beauty blogger revealed how excited she was about the ceremony - and about becoming Jason's wife.

'Jason has completely changed my life, and I could not be more thankful for who he is and how he loves me,' she told E! News. 

'I can't wait to spend forever with him.'

The groom added: 'God has blessed me with somebody I've been waiting for my whole life. Lauren changed everything for me and I can't believe I get to spend the rest of my life with her.'

Dallas-based designer Nardos Imam, who created Ms Scrugg's gorgeous strapless dress for the event, also put up a picture of the bride-to-be wearing the piece in her salon, saying that she was 'a joy to work with.' 

Ahead of the ceremony, Mr Kennedy's E! News cohost Guiliana Rancic, who interviewed Scruggs in 2012 and then played matchmaker, setting him up with his new bride, posted a photograph of her and husband Bill Rancic in what looks to be an airport above the caption: 'Dallas-bound' and with the hashtags 'jason&lauren,' 'weddingweekend' and 'ido.'

Blogger and Youtube star Angela Lanter put up an image of her and her husband wearing matching 'J [heart] Lolo' hats and said she's 'incredibly excited' to be celebrating the couple's 'big day.'

Symbol of love: Kennedy had his fiancee's name tattooed onto his ring finger after proposing, saying it will 'always remind me of the most permanent love'

At the time, Lauren revealed that the  proposal was 'the happiest night' of her life, revealing that the TV host had gone all out in order to ensure the moment was memorable.

Mr Kennedy popped the question in Dallas, in front of her family and friends, by laying out lit candles on a lawn that spelled out 'Will you marry me?' below her apartment balcony.

The couple had been dating about a year before they got engaged. 

The pair first met in December 2012 after  Rancic interviewed Ms Scruggs for E! News following her recovery from her accident.

'[Rancic] was like, 'I think you should meet Jason Kennedy,'' revealed Miss Scruggs.

'I didn't know who he was. But she told me that he had this amazing Bible study in Los Angeles and had great friends.

'She texted Jason and asked if he was going to be on set. When I was asking Giuliana about places to go hiking, she told me, 'Just ask Jason places to go. He hikes all the time.'' 

They went hiking with Miss Scruggs' mom and a friend of Mr Kennedy's the next day, and the pair became instant friends.  

Miss Scruggs' amazing recovery from the tragic plane accident has been a huge inspiration to thousands of people.

'It's kind of weird to say, but I wouldn't trade it,' she told People in November 2012. 'I have seen it as a miracle. I've been through a lot but I'm living.

'Sometimes it's easy to dwell on the fact that I don't look the same. But every day I'm feeling better and better.'
