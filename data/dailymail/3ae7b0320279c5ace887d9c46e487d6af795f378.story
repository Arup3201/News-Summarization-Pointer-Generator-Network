Breathalysers: David Nutt says every motorist should be forced to take a breath test before setting off in his new book

A former Government chief drugs adviser who controversially claimed Ecstasy is safer than drink has said alcohol sensors should be fitted in every car.

Professor David Nutt said all motorists would have to breathe into a device to prove they were not over the limit before their vehicle would start.

But the call was today dismissed as 'impractical' by the AA.

The controversial professor was sacked as the Government chief drugs adviser three years ago after claiming that drink was more harmful than Ecstasy.

He also suggested that riding a horse was more dangerous than taking the banned Class A drug.

The alcohol sensors plan is one of seven 
ways he suggests to reduce the harm caused by alcohol in his new book, 
Drugs - Without The Hot Air.

Other suggestions include shorter 
licensing hours, compelling pubs and supermarkets to sell non-alcoholic 
lagers and beers alongside alcoholic drinks, and devising less dangerous
alternatives such as drinks which give people a moderate 'buzz'.

Prof Nutt is president of the British Neuroscience Association and a professor at Imperial College, London.

He told the BBC that some countries use the in-car breath-testers, known as alcohol ignition interlock devices, to ensure that people convicted of drink-driving do not take to the wheel, but he had an even more 'radical' idea.

He said: 'You could potentially have it so that was true of all cars - everybody would have to breathe in (to the device) before they were able to drive away.

'You hear about terrible accidents when four or five young people die simultaneously in the one car because the driver’s been drunk. It could save a lot of lives.'

Professor Nutt has long courted controversy. Under his stewardship, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs resisted the reclassification of cannabis and also called for Ecstasy to be downgraded to a Class B substance. On both occasions he was overruled by ministers.

But it was a paper he authored for the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies at King's College, London, that proved the final straw.

He accused former home secretary Jacqui Smith, who reclassified cannabis, of 'distorting and devaluing' scientific research, and said smoking the drug created a 'relatively small risk' of psychotic illness.

He also claimed those who wanted to move Ecstasy into Class B from Class A - including himself - had 'won the intellectual argument'.

Most controversially, Professor Nutt said all drugs, including alcohol and tobacco, should be ranked by a 'harm' index - with drinking coming fifth behind cocaine, heroin, barbiturates, and methadone.

Alcolocks - which Prof Nutt wants fitted to all cars - are attached to the ignition
and do not allow the driver to start the engine until they have 
successfully blown into a tube.

However,
critics have pointed to the fact that it is ludicrous to make all 
drivers blow into a tube every time they start a journey.

The
system will also fail to catch the most determined drunk drivers who 
could get a sober person - or even a child - to take the test for them.

National Express began introducing the devices to their coaches last year to ensure their drivers are never over the limit.

as he left a motorway services on the M1 near Milton Keynes, 
Buckinghamshire, in September 2007.

The driver, who was one-and-a-half times the drink drive limit was jailed for ten months.

AA president Edmund King said today that introducing alcolocks to all cars was not a sensible idea.

'There is a voluntary scheme of "alcolocks" at the moment but I don’t think Prof Nutt’s plan is practical,' he said.

'Our message is that no one who drives should drink. If that message gets across and the police target drink-drivers and breathalyse more people, then you don’t need new devices.

'In France, drivers have to carry a breathalyser in the car. The problem here is that you could be under the legal drink-drive limit when you set off and then over the limit half an hour later, as it takes time for alcohol to get into the bloodstream.'
