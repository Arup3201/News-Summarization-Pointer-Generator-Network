Accused: Surgeon Ian Paterson is suspected of performing 'lumpectomy' surgery on 450 women instead of performing a simple biopsy to check for cancer

An NHS trust yesterday announced an independent inquiry into its handling of complaints about a surgeon alleged to have carried out more than 1,000 botched or unnecessary breast operations.

Ian Paterson is suspected of performing ‘lumpectomy’ surgery on 450 women instead of performing a simple biopsy to check for cancer.

He is also alleged to have performed his own ‘cleavage-sparing’ mastectomies (CSM) on around 700 more.

The procedure, which he invented, leaves some breast tissue intact for cosmetic reasons, but is not approved in Britain because residual tissue could lead to an increased risk of the disease returning.

Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust announced lawyer Sir Ian Kennedy will chair the review into how managers at Solihull Hospital and Good Hope Hospital in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, reacted to concerns ‘raised by staff, patients and the public’ about the surgeon’s work.

The review, which follows investigations already underway by the General Medical Council and West Midlands Police, will also consider if bosses acted appropriately on those concerns and responded to them ‘in a timely manner’.

Paterson worked at three NHS and two private hospitals across the Midlands from 1994 until he was suspended last October.

Police are also investigating the surgeon to see whether he should be charged with assault over the allegations he performed unnecessary surgery on 450 patients who did not have cancer.

In the aftermath of the announcement of those inquiries, some patients spoke of how their lives had been ‘ruined’ by the surgeon, while others spoke out in his support.

Hundreds of the women operated on by Paterson are believed to have launched claims for compensation against either the Trust or Spire Healthcare, which ran the two private hospitals where he worked in Solihull and Sutton Coldfield.

The majority of the procedures took place at Solihull Hospital. Many of the women believed they were having a full mastectomy, only to discover they had not.

The Trust wrote to all those women on its records operated on by Mr Paterson last year, asking them to get in touch.

Heart of England NHS Trust said Paterson had carried out only a ‘very small number’ of operations at Good Hope, in the late 1990s, while he had not performed any surgery at Solihull since May 2011.

Needless: Paula Gelsthorpe, 54, from Birmingham, had needless lumpectomies in 2002 and 2009 and said she suffered ¿an assault on the body and mind¿

Sir Ian will make recommendations to the trust’s board in a public report expected to be completed by the summer.

Lord Philip Hunt, chairman of the Heart of England trust, said the review would ‘determine whether there are lessons to be learned about how the organisation responded to the situation as it evolved, and how it might improve its response to concerns if they are raised in the future.’

Some of the women treated by Paterson said they felt mentally tortured by being led to believe they were seriously ill when, in fact, they were perfectly healthy.

Paula Gelsthorpe, 54, from Birmingham, had needless lumpectomies in 2002 and 2009 and told the Daily Mail she suffered ‘an assault on the body and mind’.

The Trust was first alerted to concerns about Paterson in 2007. He was ordered to stop the CSM technique.

Spire Healthcare was informed and also asked the surgeon to stop the procedures. But some patients have told their lawyers that he continued CSM at the private hospitals before finally being banned from all surgery at the hospitals in August 2011.

The married surgeon lives in a £1m Grade II-listed townhouse in Edgbaston, Birmingham. There was no answer at the property yesterday.

Paterson, a father-of-three, is being represented by the Medical Defence Union. A spokesman said: ‘He (Paterson) is fully co-operating with the GMC investigation.

‘He cannot comment further because of patient confidentiality and the ongoing investigation.’

Sir Ian previously conducted a major inquiry into children’s heart surgery at Bristol Royal Infirmary and currently chairs Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) monitoring MPs’ expenses.

Police are also thought to be investigating accusations Paterson made false claims to health insurers, allegedly claiming for more expensive operations than he performed and for others which were never carried out.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
