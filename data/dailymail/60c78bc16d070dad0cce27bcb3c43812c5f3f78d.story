A high school football player was suspended for four days and dropped from his team after he wrote a poem criticizing his teammates as part of a school assignment.

Nick Andre penned the scathing verse  after being asked to write about something which made him angry.

The 16-year-old student at Rittman High School in Ohio decided to make the Rittman Indians the subject of his poem after they won only once all season, losing their other seven fixtures.

Suspended: Nick Andre, pictured, wrote the poem as a school assignment, but the junior football star's criticism was not welcome

But after he read the poem in class, the school's principal reacted furiously and suspended the teenager for 'harassment and hazing'.

Nick, a defensive end on the team said: 'I felt it was my right to express what I just felt.

An extract from the poem, entitled 'Stupid', reads: 'Losing season, favoritism, non-stop passes from best friend to best friend, continuously doing what doesn't work...dropped passes, but yet, still the superstar, yea right, where's my scholarship? I can drop passes, run backwards, miss tackles.'

He read the controversial poem out in class, a move which angered the school's board of administrators.

Principal Nick Evans reacted by issuing the harsh punishment and sending a letter to the boy's mother.

'Losing season,

favoritism.

Non-stop passes from

best friend to best friend.

Continuously doing

what doesn't work'

- Extract from 'Stupid', by Nick Andre

In the note, Mr Evans wrote that Nick had, 'wrote a mean and disrespectful poem about another student and our Athletic Director/Head Coach.

'Nick will be suspended for four days and will be removed from the football team for the last two weeks of the season.'

The student criticized the decision to remove him from classes, saying the punishment could really affect his grades.

Nick's mother, Julie Andre refused to sign the suspension letter given to her by the principal, when they met on Monday.

Speaking to fox8.com, Mrs Andre said: 'All he could refer to was bullying, he said that this poem was bullying.

'My comment was, "why would the teacher 
entertain this assignment because you know, you don’t know what you may 
get from teenage kids", so to me, I couldn’t understand (the ruling).'

Offending poem: The piece was called 'Stupid' and aimed at his high school football teammates, who had only won one game all season

Out of the team: As well as being suspended Nick, pictured was dropped from the team, but a top attorney believes that the ruling may be a constitutional breach of human rights

The punishment was also criticized by a leading civil rights attorney, who said that by being punished for speaking his mind, Nick has had his rights have been infringed.

Cleveland Avery Friedman, said: 'It's obviously protected speech under the first amendment.

'The breadth of expression, even in public schools, is virtually limitless, unless speech is creating material disruption to the educational process, which certainly isn’t here.'

Rittman school district declined to comment.

The 1971, first amendment to the Constitution of the United States, part of the Bill of Rights, reads:

'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.'
