More than $21,000 has been raised for an Oklahoma grandmother after her discovery of her dog alive beneath the rubble of her tornado-torn home inspired donors from around the world following last week's horrific disaster.

Barbara Garcia tears up as she tells CBS News 'I didn't know I was that important' after seeing donations pour in for her and her little dog Bowser who was filmed miraculously emerging from the rubble of her uninsured home on Tuesday.

'One by one, they can be replaced. A lot of it wasn't even important, but I couldn't replace him,' Ms Garcia says while holding her dog securely in her battered arms late this week.

Miracle: Ms Garcia presumed her little dog was killed but during an on-camera interview outside her home's wreckage the dog was found wiggling beneath piles of debris

Ms Garcia was being interviewed amid splintered wood, metal and other wreckage immediately after the storm when a CBS producer noticed the dog wiggling directly behind her.

The grandmother only moments before reasoned that this must be 'life in the big city' while presuming the dog had been killed after calling for it hopelessly but without any answer.

To everyone's astonishment, however, the dog survived.

On camera Ms Garcia is seen in tears as she struggles to dig her pet out and then come to terms with what she considered to be a miracle.

She tells the news cameras, 'I thought God just answered one prayer to let me be OK but he answered both of them because that was my second prayer.'

As of Saturday morning $21,368 has been raised for the grandmother thanks to an online fundraising site set up by a total stranger.

It took only 24 hours for it to pull in $1,500, the website said.

Barbara Garcia thought her dog had died when the tornado leveled her house in Moore, Oklahoma

Erin DeRuggiero, who set up the account, told perspective donors: 'I was shattered upon seeing her home destroyed, her recounting her experience and her joy upon seeing that her dog had survived it all.

'My goal is to ease her recovery, raise enough money to help her start to rebuild or relocate her life, and above all else, to show her that "life in the big city" also means helping one another, even from 1500 miles away.'

Ms Garcia's little miracle, coupled 
with the generosity of support from total strangers, is one of the few 
pieces of good news to come out of Moore after the two-mile wide tornado
ripped through the small town on Monday.

At least 24 people have been killed, including around 9 children.

During an interview with CBS a member of the camera crew spotted the dog emerging from the rubble

The pensioner told interviewer Anna 
Werner that fateful day: 'I was sitting on my stool holding my dog. This was the game 
plan all through the years to go in that little bathroom.

'I never lost consciousness and I hollered for my little dog and he didn't answer or didn't come.'

Several families have lost pets in the devastating tornado.

On
Tuesday McClain County Animal Response Team spokesperson Dr. Patty 
Mannas told KOCO-TV  that at least 50 had been pulled from the rubble.

'We’ve
already reunited a few animals and animals with microchips have a very,
very high percentage of being reunited with their families,' she said.
