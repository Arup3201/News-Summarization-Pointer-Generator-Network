Matt Lauer has been spotted taking a break - perhaps to forget his low popularity ratings - by enjoying boating lessons on his new yacht, which he has appropriately named 'Resilient'.

The Today show host was seen taking a long trip on Sag Harbor Bay in East Hampton, New York behind the wheel of his new Hinckley T38, which costs $1.4 million without added features.

Lauer, who was sporting a cap and khakis, was spotted by a New York Daily News photographer on Saturday as he took tips from two instructors aboard the luxury vessel.

The morning host and his wife, Annette Roque, have a $15 million mansion in the Hamptons, which is next to a $3.5 million, 30-acrea plot of land they are currently renovating to turn into a horse farm.

But the plans have angered residents living in the area, and many have attempted to prevent the construction, claiming it will be too intrusive and could cause traffic problems.

The massive estate in Water Mill includes 36 horse stalls, a riding arena and a man-made pond. When completed, the stables will include an indoor arena, paddocks and barns.

The day-long boat trip comes amid bad ratings for the once-beloved morning show anchor, who has come under fire since his co-host Ann Curry was ousted from her spot last year.

Appropriate: The vessel is named 'Resilient', which is apt considering his low ratings on the morning show

He was blamed for her swift departure, even though NBC bosses denied he had a part in it.

Yet Lauer seems to be very aware of his poor ratings.

At an event honoring Bloomberg Media Group CEO Andrew Lack earlier this month, he told the crowd that was surprised he had been invited to speak.

'If you’ve been following the papers lately, you know it’s been a bit rough for me,' Lauer said. 'These days, I only get asked to host dinners if polio is busy. I have a lower Q rating than polio right now.'

In the television industry, a Q score is a highly cited measure of likeability. Lauer's score has fallen by more than half in the last two years.

Days earlier, Lauer dug a bit further at himself as he introduced former 'Today' host Katie Couric.

'Katie has a way of making headlines,' he said. 'Who can forget when she was co-host of the "Today" show? She got a colonoscopy on TV. Not to be outdone, two weeks ago, I got one in The New York Times.'

Lauer could have been referring to any of a myriad of critical articles in the Times that have been written about him recently.

But he was likely referring to a story written by media critic Brian Stetler, which fingered Lauer as the reason for the 'Today' show's failing ratings.

'It is clear that the once-popular 
host’s relationship with his audience is in peril,' Stetler wrote. 'Mr. 
Lauer’s year is a lesson in how a combination of missteps - NBC’s and 
his own - can precipitate a star’s fall.'

Angry viewers have been calling on 
NBC to fire Lauer, who was blamed for playing a part in co-host Curry's 
ignominious demotion last year, and Today is still lagging behind its 
arch-rival on NBC.
