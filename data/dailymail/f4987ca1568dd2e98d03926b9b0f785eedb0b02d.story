It reads: ‘To all our families, we love you and miss you always.

‘Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.’

At the end of the footage, the crew are pictured standing at the bow of their ship in front of a giant banner wishing the world a Merry Christmas.

Individual sailors are also pictured with their own personal messages to family back home.

HMS Edinburgh - based in Portsmouth, Hants - is the last of the Royal Navy's Type 42 destroyers.

It will be the last time a Type 42 deploys on operations as they make way for the new generation of Type 45 destroyers.

HMS Edinburgh is due to return to Portsmouth in March before preparing for her decommissioning.
