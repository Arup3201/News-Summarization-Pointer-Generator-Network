A woman who allegedly pocketed £50,000 in disability payments and claimed she was too scared to go outside was in fact working as a tour guide in Argentina while travelling the world, a court heard yesterday.

Tracy Johnson, 52, has also been pictured in front of the sprawling salt plains of Argentina in images shown to the jury.

In the snaps, from an unknown time, she poses and smiles with a camera at the far-flung locations. Prosecutors have claimed that she made false claims and took the lavish trips abroad between January 2008 and July 2012.

While claiming cash from the taxpayer on 
the grounds that she could hardly walk and needed daily care, she even 
visited India and New York, where she worked as a travel writer, the 
court was told.

Johnson said she was a ‘prisoner in her own home’ as she pocketed disability payments for four years.

She told the authorities that she spent all day in her bedroom where she felt ‘safe’, and she needed a friend to act as a carer.

But instead, she toured the world living a ‘champagne lifestyle’ as a travel writer, as well as running a business as a tour operator in Argentina, a jury was told.

She was caught out when investigators tried to contact her about her claims and found she was out of the country.

Joanna James, prosecuting, told Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court: ‘Tracy Johnson was living the life that honest, decent, hardworking taxpayers could only dream of.

‘While workers were going out to do their daily grind, she was shopping in New York or having a few days in Madrid.

‘She said she was unable to live on a day-to-day basis because she was agoraphobic, suffered depression, hallucinations, anxiety, blackouts and post-traumatic stress disorder.

‘But while submitting claim forms telling the authorities that she was unwell, she was travelling the world on taxpayers’ money.

'It was absolute, blatant dishonesty.’

Miss James said Johnson also claimed she rarely came into contact with other people and was distressed and agitated when she talked of her illness.

She added: ‘She said she stumbled and fell repeatedly and could not walk more than five metres without help.’

The court heard how Johnson, of Frome,
 Somerset, had changed her address to her mother’s home in Builth Wells,
 Powys, for the purpose of claiming benefits.

She was arrested when she 
tried to renew her benefits claim in June after she returned from India.

Miss
 James said: ‘In 2012 she decided to use taxpayers’ money to have a 
four-month trip around India.

When police searched her home, luggage 
tags were still on her suitcases.

'They
 found receipts with her name on for jewellery bought in India and 
flight confirmation printouts to Jaipur with hotel reservations and 
payment confirmations.’

Johnson,
 who is representing herself, is accused of fraud, dishonestly making a 
false representation and dishonestly failing to notify a change in 
circumstances. She denies all 13 charges.

The trial continues.
