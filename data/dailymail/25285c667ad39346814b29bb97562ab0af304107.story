Jewellery cases smashed. Mobile phones ripped from displays. Cash registers emptied. Alcohol stocks plundered.

For the second time in two months, poorly paid Kenyan security forces that moved in to control an emergency are being accused of robbing the very property they were supposed to protect. First the troops were accused of looting during a huge fire in August at Nairobi's main airport.

Now shop owners at Westgate Mall are returning to their stores after last week's devastating terrorist attack to find displays ransacked and valuables stolen.

One witness told The Associated Press that he saw a Kenyan soldier take cigarettes out of a dead man's pocket.

The shock revelation that looting businesses and robbing bodies took place comes a day after the first pictures
from inside the mall were revealed.

Shopping
trolleys abandoned, bags dropped on the floor and beer bottles left 
where they stand, these haunting images show the shops which were 
deserted in the aftermath of the Nairobi mall massacre which left 67 
people dead and dozens more missing.

Carts
full of goods were left standing in Westgate Mall as shoppers fled for 
their lives when jihadi terrorists rushed the building and started 
gunning down customers.

The
photographs show how people apparently dropped bags on the ground as 
they made their escape, forming a disturbing portrait of the moment 
chaos broke out.

Shopkeepers
spent Monday carting merchandise and other valuables out of their 
stores and restaurants to prevent any more thefts. No one can say for 
sure who is responsible, but Kenya's security forces are strongly 
suspected.

Soon after 
the attack began on September 21, Kenyan officials put a cordon around 
the mall, allowing only security forces and a few government personnel 
to pass through.

Since 
then, alcohol stocks from the restaurants have been depleted. One 
business owner at the mall said money and mobile phones were taken from 
bags and purses left behind in the mayhem. The owner insisted on 
anonymity to avoid retribution from Kenya's government.

Attack: Bags, beers and personal belongings were left behind in the Artcaffe. As the gunmen walked through the mall, shooting anyone in sight, shoppers ran, hid or died

Empty: The Artcaffe restaurant and coffee shop is situated on the ground floor of Westgate. Little damage can be seen here compared to the devastation in other areas of the mall

Employees
of a book shop on the mall's second floor returned to find registers 
yanked open and cash gone. The store's laptops were also stolen. All the
shop's books remained in place, said owner Paku Tsavani.

Perhaps reluctant to blame Kenyan security forces, Tsavani said he doesn't know who took his goods.

'Obviously the terrorists wouldn't steal those things, so we just don't know,' Tsavani said.

Sandeep
Vidyarthi went into the mall Sunday to help a relative retrieve 
equipment from his dental practice. Inside he said he passed shop after 
shop that had been looted, including the Rado store that sells high-end 
Swiss watches.

As he 
was leaving the mall, Vidyarthi passed a jewellery shop near the front 
entrance. The owner, he said, was presenting security officials with a 
long list of missing precious stones and high-end necklaces.

'The jeweller had written down this very long list,' he said.

It
is ironic, said the management team of one Westgate business, that 
store owners must now make reports of stolen goods to the same security 
forces suspected of doing the thieving.

Interior
Minister Joseph Ole Lenku confirmed the reports of theft Sunday in a 
news conference. The majority of the responders to the terrorist attack 
came from Kenya's military. A military spokesman did not answer repeated
calls for comment.

'Those responsible for looting will be prosecuted,' Lenku said.

The
mall attack also saw good Samaritans. Paresh Shah, a volunteer who 
helped evacuate the injured and recover the dead during the first day, 
said he carried out the body of Aleem Jamal.

Shah frowned at the memory and said he saw a Kenyan soldier take Jamal's cigarettes while in the ambulance. 

'I could never do that, take a dead man's cigarettes,' Shah said.

Forensics: Investigators work in the mall passageways scouring the building for clues which may lead to other terrorists involved in the attack

Jamal's family retrieved the body at the morgue, where his wife, Taz Jamal, said her husband's wallet was missing.

A
team of terrorists entered Westgate Mall shortly after noon on a busy 
Saturday, firing guns and throwing grenades. The attackers - the Somali 
extremist group al-Shabab claimed responsibility - held off Kenya's 
military and controlled at least parts of the mall for four days.

The attack killed at least 67 people. The mall now has a gaping three-story hole in it from the siege.

Almost
a week after the attack ended, more than three dozen people remain 
unaccounted for, the head of the Kenyan Red Cross said Monday.

The government contends there are no remaining missing people.

'The
only way to verify this is when the government declares the Westgate 
Mall 100 per cent cleared. Then we can resolve it,' Red Cross head Abbas
Gullet said.

A morgue 
worker told AP on Monday that six body parts have been found in the 
rubble. The worker, who insisted on anonymity because he was not 
authorised to speak about information not yet released, said it was not 
clear if the parts came from one or multiple bodies.

Five
terrorists are believed to be under the rubble but no dead hostages, 
Interior Minister Lenku said Sunday. Government officials have said 10 
to 15 terrorists attacked the mall. Lenku said some attackers might have
escaped.

'We do not 
rule out the possibility that when we were evacuating people in the 
first stages of the operation, it is possible some could have slipped 
out,' he said.

FBI 
agents, along with investigators from Britain, Canada and Germany, are 
participating in the investigation into the attack and are aiding Kenyan
forensic experts. Results are not expected until later this week at the
earliest.

Kenyan 
authorities have used anti-terrorism laws to detain a total of 12 people
in connection with the attack, including one on Sunday. Three have been
set free, including a British man with a bruised face who was 
reportedly arrested last week as he tried to board a flight from Nairobi
to Turkey while acting suspiciously, the British Foreign Office 
confirmed Monday.

Ndung'u
Githinji, chairman of parliament's foreign relations committee, said 
officials will 'rethink' Kenya's hospitality in supporting refugee 
camps, a reference to Dadaab, a camp near Somalia filled with more than 
400,000 Somalis. Security officials say some elements in the camp 
support and facilitate terror attacks.

Investigation: Forensic police inspect a saloon car parked near the main entrance of the mall

Investigators
from Britain, Canada, the U.S. and Germany, are helping in the 
investigation into the attack and are aiding Kenyan forensic experts 
poring through the mall complex. Results are not expected until later 
this week at the earliest.

In
addition to the 61 civilians and six troops reported killed in the 
attack, the government has said five of the attackers were killed by 
gunfire and at least one more is thought to be in the building's rubble.

The
militant group al-Shabab has said it carried out the mall attack to 
punish Kenya for sending its troops into neighboring Somalia to fight 
the Al Qaeda-linked militant group that had seized large parts of that 
country for years before being dislodged from the capital, Mogadishu.
