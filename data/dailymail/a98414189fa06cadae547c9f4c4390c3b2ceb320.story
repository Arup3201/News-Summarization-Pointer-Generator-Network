A surfer has been killed by a shark off a notorious stretch of Australia's west coast today.

The 35-year-old man was surfing off a beach near Gracetown, about 167 miles south of Perth, when he was attacked.

Eyewitnesses have told how his arm was missing and there were no signs of life as he was dragged to the shore.

Scene: The 35-year-old man was surfing off Lefthanders Beach, pictured, near Gracetown, when he was attacked by a shark

The shark is believed to have 'bounced' off the board of another surfer, before launching the fatal strike at 9am.

The victim, from Margaret River, was dragged onto Lefthanders Beach after being pulled onto another surfer's board.

One of his arms was missing and he was pronounced dead at the scene, according to Sky News.

His body was later taken away by helicopter, while his green and yellow surf board was also recovered.

Deadly: Gracetown, situated about 167 miles south of Perth, has seen three fatal attacks in the past decade

Speaking today, Sergeant Craig Anderson said: ‘His injuries appear to be consistent with those that would be received in a shark attack.'

Stuart Smith, the Fisheries Department's director general, immediately closed beaches in the area.

He has issued an 'imminent threat' order for the shark to be captured - but insists he will not be putting out a ‘shoot to kill’ command.

A
fisheries vessel with a hook and lines is currently scouring the water, while 
urgent warnings have been issued to locals to stay 
out of the water.

‘The area is considered a high risk and hazard region because of the high number of swimmers and surfers there,’ said Mr Smith.

He added that he was particularly concerned about the large number of school leavers who are currently on holiday in the area.

Killer: No details of the type of shark responsible for the latest attack have been released. However, great whites, pictured, are often to blame for fatalities off Australia's west coast

As news of the attack spread, crowds began to gather at the beach. They were later joined by the surfer's devastated relatives.

Australia has become the world's deadliest country for shark attacks.

Experts say the creatures often attack surfboards and their riders because they believed the shape resembles seals, one of their prey.

Gracetown - the state's top surfing and wine-making region - alone has seen three fatal shark attacks in the past decade.

Yesterday, the girlfriend of 24-year-old Ben Lendin, who was killed by a shark in West Australia 
last year, posted a message on Facebook paying tribute to the latest victim.

Injured: Last month, Greg Pickering, 55, suffered severe wounds to his chest and face yesterday after being mauled by a shark off Poison Creek beach, 99 miles east of Esperance

Second time: The Australian spear fisherman, pictured being carried from the scene, had previously survived a shark attack off Cervantes, north of Perth, in 2004

‘Another man lost,’ wrote Alana Noakes. ‘Thinking about his family and 
friends, remembering what we all went through. All I want to do is hug 
them.

‘Life can be over so quickly, so make the most of your weekend with each other.’

Mr Linden’s body was never found, despite an intense air and sea 
search, but an inquest last month was told there was no doubt he had 
been killed in a ‘catastrophic shark attack'.

Last month, an Australian spear fisherman and 
diver suffered severe wounds to his chest and face yesterday after being mauled
by a shark off Poison Creek beach, 99 miles east of Esperance. 

Greg Pickering, 55, 
was dragged onto a boat near Esperance after being savaged by the animal while he was fishing.

He had previously survived a shark attack off Cervantes, north of Perth, in 2004.

No details of the type of shark responsible for the latest attack have been released.

However, great 
whites are often to blame for fatalities off Australia's west coast.
