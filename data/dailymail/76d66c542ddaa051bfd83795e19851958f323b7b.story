An attention hungry raven is on the loose and flew right in front of a camera filming the home of the San Francisco 49ers, Levi's Stadium.

The NFL stadium in Santa Clara, California is being turned into an outdoor hockey rink for an NHL game on Saturday between the San Jose Sharks and the Los Angeles Kings and is undergoing a serious makeover.

The stadium staff hoped to film the transformation by 200 workers over the past few days and was visited by one very menacing raven in the process. 

Who you lookin' at?: This raven photobombed a camera filming the transformation of Levi's Stadium into an ice rink for a game between the San Jose Sharks and the Los Angeles Kings on Saturday

Open wide: The raven opens its beak to perhaps express its enthusiasm about the upcoming NHL game in and NFL stadium home to the San Francisco 49ers

That's no ice rink! Levi's Stadium in Santa, Clara California home to the San Francisco 49ers, pictured as a football stadium, will be an NHL ice rink on Saturday night

After noticing the plucky bird on film, those responsible for filming the stadium preparation took the footage of the bird and added some ominous music in the background which made for a humorous video posted to YouTube that already has over 500,000 views.

In the chirpy film, the raven ruffles his feathers a few times and lets out a few strong, 'cacaws!' before flying away into the infinite sky perhaps only to return when thousands of fans fill the seats.

Raven or no raven, the game between the Sharks and the Kings will occur at 7 p.m. on Saturday night as part of the 2015 Coors Light NHL Stadium Series.

Since some 70,000 spectators along with one bird are expected at the game, extra seating has been added to the already magnanimous stadium. 

The L.A. Times reports that this is the second outdoor games for the Kings. The team lost 3-0 to the Anaheim Ducks in January of last year.

Fly by appearance: The raven flies off into the infinite sky to allow the camera to finish filming video of the stadium as it prepares for Saturday's game

Even more fans: The often busy stadium is expecting 70,000 fans on Saturday night so extra seating has been added to make room for spectators and avian guests
