But others are simply too upset to come and get them.

She said: 'After a funeral, the ashes are kept at one of our branches until family members are ready to collect them.

'However, we understand that there are many reasons why families may choose to leave the ashes in our care.

'For some, collecting them is too painful, in some cases it can be down to a breakdown in family communications on who will collect the remains.

'Others simply need more time to decide what to do with them.

'We feel is it our responsibility to now try and reunite these families with the cremated remains of their loved ones.

'We believe it is only right that every individual is given the opportunity of a peaceful final resting place.'

The funeral directors has now launched an appeal to have the 405 unclaimed sets of ashes reunited with families.

It comes after the company, which has been conducting funerals for more than 50 years, carried out an audit in their three branches in Southampton.

They have already tried to track down some of the families.

Some wanted the company to hold on to the ashes while others came in to collect them.

The National Association of Funeral Directors has specific guidelines in place for unclaimed ashes, and recommends its members store them for a minimum of five years.
