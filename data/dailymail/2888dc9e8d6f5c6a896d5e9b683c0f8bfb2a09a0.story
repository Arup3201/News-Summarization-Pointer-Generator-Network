The nurse who was allegedly kicked in the crotch by Bobby Kennedy's son has spoken out about what she described as an 'assault' at the hospital where she works.

Cari Luciano, who is 5ft tall, told her husband, 'I was assaulted tonight and could you believe it, it was a Kennedy who did it?'

Douglas Kennedy, a journalist, was arrested for allegedly attacking two nurses who tried to stop him removing his newborn baby from hospital.

Charges: Douglas Kennedy, pictured with his wife Molly and their son Boru, was arrested this week over an alleged incident which occurred following the birth of the baby

Hospital: Mr Kennedy is shown in security footage trying to take his newborn son for a walk

He is charged with harassment and endangering the welfare of a child following the altercation, which happened last month.

A spokesman for the family said they 
hoped to have 'a full picture of the events that occurred that night' in
order to prove Mr Kennedy's innocence.

Ms Luciano's husband told the Daily 
News the nurse was simply trying to ensure that Mr Kennedy followed 
hospital rules when he wanted to take his two-day-old son Boru for a 
walk.

Steve Luciano rubbished the idea that
his wife could have been an aggressor, saying: 'Cari is probably 5ft 
tall on her best day.'

'Attack': A figure shown falling over in the corridor is said to be a nurse kicked in the crotch by Mr Kennedy

Fall: Mr Kennedy is also said to have twisted the arm of a nurse who tried to block his way

He also suggested that Mr Kennedy's 
family background influenced his decision to remove a GPS tracker from 
his son and take the baby for a walk.

'My understanding is that Mr Kennedy 
took it off and said something like, "My son needs to get fresh air,"' 
said Mr Luciano. 'From my perspective, the doctor assumed that between 
your name and my status, what rules apply?'

Mr Kennedy strongly refutes the charges, and told NBC New York the claims were 'absurd'.

The accusations date from January 7, 
when Mr Kennedy, 44, was visiting his wife Molly and their newborn son -
the couple's fourth - in Northern Westchester Hospital in New York.

Mr and Mrs Kennedy then started to take the baby for a walk outside, but were stopped by nurses concerned for the boy's safety.

They asked him to return the newborn 
to the emergency room, but he refused - encouraged by Dr Timothy 
Haydock, a family friend who works at the hospital.

When Mr Kennedy ignored them and 
walked in to the elevator, nurses triggered a 'code pink', which alerts 
staff that someone is trying to abduct a baby.

Accused: Mr Kennedy has been charged with harassment and endangerment of a child

Scene: The altercation happened at the Northern Westchester Hospital in suburban New York on January 7

Police said that one nurse, Anna 
Margaret Lane, stood in Mr Kennedy's way, so he grabbed her wrist and 
twisted it to move her out of the way.

A police statement continued that the
baby's head started to 'move from side to side, and in an attempt to 
stabilise the baby's head, Ms Luciano reached toward the infant's head.'

Ms Luciano told authorities: 
'Instinctively as a nurse, I raised both my arms toward the neck of the 
baby to steady the violent shaking of the baby's head and neck.'

But Mr Kennedy then allegedly kicked her in the pelvis and caused her to fall over.

In security footage of the incident, a figure can be seen to fall backwards away from the elevator.

Mr Kennedy then fell on the floor, 
still holding his son, and jumped up to run downstairs, according to the
police report, but was 'stopped by security and escorted back to the 
infant's room'.

He was charged with the alleged offences on Thursday.

Family: Mr Kennedy is pictured as a baby with his parents Bobby and Ethel Kennedy, months before the assassination of the former Attorney General and presidential candidate

The Kennedys deny any wrongdoing, and
said in a statement: 'The nurse had no right to attempt to grab our 
child out of his father's arms and I, Douglas, was shocked and appalled 
when she did so.'

The family's lawyer told the Daily News: 'This is nothing more than a money grab.'

Dr Haydock has supported the couple's story and claimed that 'the nurses were the only aggressors'.

Mr Kennedy is a reporter and occasional presenter for Fox News, having started his career with the New York Post.

He is the tenth son of Bobby Kennedy,
the U.S. senator, Attorney General and presidential candidate who was 
assassinated in 1968, five years after the death of his brother JFK.
