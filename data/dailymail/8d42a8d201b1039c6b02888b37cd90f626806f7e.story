When Ian Usher, 50, from Barnard Castle in Country Durham decided he had had enough of life in the fast lane, his solution was dramatic.

Recently divorced, fed up with his job and tired of his new life in Australia, in 2008 Ian put his entire life up for sale on eBay, with his car, job and motorbike among the items included.

£216,000 better off, he decamped to a deserted island in the Caribbean and six years on, says, despite the lack of creature comforts, he's happier than ever.

Now his incredible story is to appear on a new Ben Fogle documentary in which he reveals what giving everything up for a new life in the wilderness is really like.

'I’ve always been a bit of an adventurer and so have always spent a lot of time pursuing outdoor activities such as climbing, canoeing and diving,' he reveals.

Thanks to his new home, a tropical island off the coast of Panama, he has plenty of time to indulge in all three, even if that does mean living without electricity and running water in a tiny self-built cabin and growing or raising most of his own food.

'We're not completely self sufficient 
here on the island,' he admits. 'We do grow coconuts, pineapples, yukka, sugar cane 
and almonds but we haven’t yet perfected the art of growing other 
vegetables on our land.

Isolated: The island is a 20-minute boat ride from the nearest jungle town and was totally uninhabited

Transport: Usher and his girlfriend Vanessa Anderson use homemade canoes to get around

'We have 10 chickens who roam free on the 
island so our eggs are totally organic. Sometimes the local Indians will
 bring freshly caught fish to the dock for us to buy.

'Everything else 
comes from the supermarket in town or Ernie’s Jungle 7/11 – a small 
store on the edge of the jungle.'

With little need for cash thanks to his eBay sale and the book deal that ensued, most of Ian's time is spent working on the land or relaxing on the beach.

'We usually get up quite early, between 
five and six o’clock and do some work until around nine,' reveals Ian.

'Then it’s 
breakfast for us, the chickens and the dog. We get involved with the 
local VHF radio transmission a couple of days a week that broadcasts to 
the expats.

'We spend time working outside on the land, snorkelling on 
the reefs off the bay, swimming and reading.

Home: Ian lives in a house he built himself and grows much of his own food on the island

'Once in every 10 days we go to town for food 
supplies and fuel. Sundays without fail we go to our jungle restaurant, 
Rana Azul, where we meet up with the local community for an afternoon of
 drink, food and dancing.'

Despite the remoteness of his new home, which is a 20-minute boat ride from the nearest town, Ian has found someone willing to share it with him - girlfriend Vanessa Anderson, who he met last year during a visit to London.

'Vanessa coming to live here has made a big difference [to my life].' he reveals. 'We met last year when I passed briefly 
through London and she came to live here a couple of months later.'

With Vanessa on board, Ian says his happiness is complete and adds, his family notwithstanding, that jet-skiing is the only thing he misses about life in the UK.

'There isn’t really much I miss at all,' he says. 'I
 enjoy living a relatively simple life. Maybe a better internet 
connection would be good. Oh, and an evening out with family and friends
 at a good English pub on a Friday night.

'Vanessa still misses a London style cappuccino
 but I think she’ll get over that soon.'

He adds: 'I wouldn’t change anything - I really enjoyed building an off-grid home and living on the island. I've always thought life is supposed to be an adventure.'

Ian and Vanessa appear on Ben Fogle: New Lives in the Wild, tonight at 9pm on Channel 5
