The controversy over Liam Fox’s relationship with his aide Adam Werritty is to be reignited in a high-profile trial – just as the former Defence Secretary is tipped to make a dramatic political comeback.

Amid growing speculation that Dr Fox could be made Chief Whip in a reshuffle, a High Court judge has scheduled a trial for the autumn over a defamation claim filed by the former Cabinet Minister.

The saga led to Dr Fox’s resignation from the Cabinet 20 months ago after it emerged that during a meeting at a five-star hotel, Mr Werritty had given a card to a Dubai businessman which falsely suggested he held a formal Ministry of Defence position.

Dr Fox has filed a lawsuit against the businessman, Harvey Boulter, which claims that he had ‘gravely injured’ his reputation and ‘exposed him to public scandal, contempt and odium’ in a TV interview he gave during the furore.

Now Mr Justice Bean has cleared the case to come to trial, which could be held as early as this autumn – around the time  Dr Fox could be taking up the reins as Chief Whip.

Sources say  Dr Fox is being considered for the role because of his popularity on the Right of the Party, which is putting pressure on Mr Cameron over Europe.

The trial is likely to place  the Government’s relationship  with lobbyists under  renewed focus.

Mr Boulter said he welcomed the chance to ‘reopen the issues’.

Simon Smith, Dr Fox’s lawyer, said: ‘The trial will take place despite Mr Boulter’s argument that there was no case to be heard. So I shall see  him there.’
