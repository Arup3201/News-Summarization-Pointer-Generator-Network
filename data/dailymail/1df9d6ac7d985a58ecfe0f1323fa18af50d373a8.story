Two Chinese farmers got more than they bargained for when they pulled up the root of a fleece flower - and came face-to-face with the doppelganger of Homer Simpson.

The large root appears to have two bulging eyes and a prominent nose - giving it an uncanny resemblance to the famous cartoon character.

With two offshoot roots shaped like arms, it even looks like it is pondering or confused - just what you would expect from the real Homer.

Quite a handful: Farmer Mr Zhang holds up the Homer-shaped fleece flower root which was dug up to be used in a traditional Chinese medicine

The fleece flower roots are pulled up so they can be used in traditional Chinese medicine as cure for male sexual dysfunction, infertility, and male baldness.

They are very large and are often shaped like human faces, but this is the first time one has looked a cartoon character.

The fleece flower root, which are often very large, is a vital ingredient for a traditional Chinese cure for male sexual dysfunction, infertility, and male baldness

But this isn't the first time a Homer Simpson look-a-like has been spotted.

In March, a fish known as a Stargazer which looked like Homer was spotted peering up from the seabed in the Lembeh Strait in North Sulawesi, Indonesia.

With its bulging eyes and clueless expression, the miserable-looking marine creature looked the spitting image of the sage of Springfield.

Photographer Mark Webster, from Falmouth in Cornwall, snapped the strange-looking creature while on a diving exhibition in South East Asia.

The 56-year-old, who has been a 
professional photographer for more than 20 years, said he was hoping to 
capture a picture of a strange creature and was delighted to have 
succeeded.

The 
father-of-two said: 'I had seen Stargazers before at other locations in 
Indonesia but the desire to find one here was that the colour of the 
fish would contrast well with the dark volcanic sand.

'I
 knew this would make the strange features stand out more. I'd asked my 
guide to help me find a Stargazer and eventually we succeeded.

'I immediately saw a resemblance to Homer Simpson with the bulging eyes and that slightly vacant look with its mouth open.'

And in 2011, a couple discover a statue that looked like the world's favourite cartoon character.

Rosalind
 and Donald McIntyre made the discovery when they were clearing the 
bottom of their garden at their home in Fife, Scotland.

Mrs McIntyre, 46, from Cupar, believes it could be a gargoyle from a former church in the area built in the 1200s.

She
 said: 'We have had a lot of people saying how much it looks like Homer -
 it’s quite funny really. I think it is the shape of his head.'

Fellow look-a-likes: This Stargazer fish 
discovered in the depths of the Lembeh Strait, in Indonesia, in March also looks like a
 ghoulish take-off of the gormless TV character Homer Simpson
