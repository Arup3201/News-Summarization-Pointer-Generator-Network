NHS staff have been caught writing favourable reviews of their hospitals on patient feedback websites.

They were awarding hospitals five-star ratings and posting messages such as ‘the doctor was very helpful’, ‘lovely staff’ and ‘very impressed with the consultant’.

An investigation found half the reviews of one NHS trust – Nottinghamshire – on a popular feedback site were written by its own employees.

Campaigners accused staff of being dishonest and said their actions undermined patients’ ‘fundamental trust’.

There are a number of TripAdvisor-style websites where patients can review hospitals and other services and give them a score out of five stars.

But an investigation by the BBC’s Newsnight programme found half of 100 reviews of Nottinghamshire NHS Trust on website Patient Opinion had been written by staff.

The trust, which mainly runs mental health services, claimed that staff were writing on behalf of vulnerable patients – such as the elderly or those with learning difficulties – who would otherwise have been unable to comment on care.

But the investigation identified many highly suspicious reviews on other websites, which looked as though they had been written by staff pretending to be patients.

They included comments such as: ‘Very impressed with the consultant’, ‘the investigations were very thorough and performed very  efficiently’, ‘The doctor was very helpful’ and ‘lovely staff’.

On the Care Connect website, launched by the NHS last summer, reviews apparently by staff rated hospitals a whole star higher on average than those by patients.

NHS whistleblower Gary Walker, who was forced out of his job at United Lincolnshire Hospitals, said: ‘We’ve known for a long time that the culture of the NHS is one of staff under pressure to deliver results. I think this is a symptom of that, that staff are now putting on results that aren’t necessarily true and it’s interfering with results. 

‘The data they are reporting is skewing the results. That’s wrong. It’s making the data the public sees almost meaningless.’

Paul Hodgkin, chief executive of the Patient Opinion website, said: ‘Patients and families think the NHS is going to tell them the truth in all sorts of ways. But if there’s an incentive to do little things, like I’ll just put in this story that looks good, that actually attacks that fundamental trust.’

Neil Churchill, director of patient experience at NHS England, said: ‘We can’t guarantee that all the reviews are coming from patients and families but we can be sure that the vast majority are.

‘What they were doing in Nottingham was to help vulnerable people have a voice . . . The NHS in England is leading the world in patient feedback. We have to get this in proportion. At that kind of scale you cannot game [cheat] it.’

In August, the NHS launched Care Connect in a bid to make the system more transparent.

It covers 20 hospitals in London, but by 2015 it will be rolled out to every trust and GP in the country.In its first few weeks, it was bombarded with negative reviews about ‘appalling’ care, dismissive nurses and blood-spattered A&E units.
