Struck off: Grace Adeleye was banned from ever practising as a nurse in the UK again after a baby died during a home circumcision

A nurse who let a three-and-a-half week baby bleed to death after carrying out a circumcision using just scissors, forceps and olive oil has been banned from practising in the UK.

Grace Adeleye, 67, performed the dangerous African treatment known as a 'clamp and cut' on Goodluck Caubergs for a fee of £100 at the baby's home in Chadderton, Greater Manchester.

A Nursing and Midwifery Council panel heard that Adeleye carried out the circumcision at around 5pm on April 16 2010 and that Goodluck was still bleeding at 7am the following morning.

Adeleye had reassured the baby's parents, whom she had been put in touch with by a mutual friend, that the bleeding was slowing.

But Goodluck was eventually taken to the Royal Oldham Hospital later that morning where he died shortly after arrival.

A post mortem later found he died from blood loss.

Sitting in London today, the panel ruled that Adeleye, who was found guilty of manslaughter at Manchester Crown Court on February 9, should never work as a nurse in this country again.

NMC panel chair, Karen Heenan, said: ‘Ms Adeleye’s actions resulted in the death of a three and a half week old baby.

‘She has provided the panel with no evidence of insight or remediation and as such the panel cannot be confident that there would not be a repetition of her actions.

‘The panel therefore decided that a Striking-Off Order was the only sanction which was sufficient to protect the public.

‘The panel was further concerned at Ms Adeleye’s failures to obtain informed consent and to provide the parents with any written or verbal information regarding aftercare, either before or after the procedure.’

Adeleye had previously received a 21-month jail term suspended for two years at Manchester Crown Court and quickly announced she would be retiring from nursing.

The court heard the nurse had performed thousands of similar procedures with each one costing £100 as she operated from a mobile clinic.

Many of the parents whose babies Adeleye treated were unaware that the simple procedure is available on the NHS.

Adeleye, who did not attend her central London hearing, was struck off with immediate effect.

Most circumcisions in the UK are done for religious reasons but currently no formal qualifications are required to perform the operation.
