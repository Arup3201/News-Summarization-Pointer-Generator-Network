Seven dangerous Al-Qaeda suspects are to be freed from Government curfews and able to walk the streets within days, it has emerged.

The men, some of whom are suspected of plotting to kill thousands on transatlantic airliners, will no longer be bound by electronic tags or curfew restrictions after the terrorism prevention orders are lifted.

The measures were introduced in 2012 to replace Labour government rules which, according to the Liberal Democrats, undermined the suspects' human rights. 

However they only last two years unless the government can prove the suspects have engaged in 'new' terrorist-related activity.

Officials say such proof is hard if not impossible to come by as the men, who have not been named, know their behavior is being monitored.

Under the curbs, suspects are required to stay at home for up to 10 hours each night, wear electronic tags and are banned from certain places.

Among the seven due to be freed this month is a would-be suicide bomber known only by his initials, AM.

The Sunday Times reports the 26-year-old 
was involved in what investigators called 'Operation Overt', a plot to 
attack flights from London to America in 2006.

Another is, BF, a former train driver who was part of a group of British extremists seeking terrorist training in Pakistan.

Others
 include a 30-year-old who attended a training camp alongside four of 
the attempted suicide bombers involved in failed attacks on London in 
2005, and a man who was trained by al-Shabaab, the group responsible for
 the massacre at Westgate shopping centre in Nairobi. 

The whereabouts of two suspects is 
unknown, including that of Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed who cut off his 
electric tag while visiting a mosque last November.

A senior Whitehall security official confirmed the men would be released over the next month.

MI5, the police and the Home Office has been working together to decide what action to take once the men are freed.

'We've been planning how to mitigate the risks,' said a security offiIcial.

The Home Office said it had 'tailored plans' to manage the risk, adding: 'These plans, similar to those put in place for the release of prisoners who had served their sentenced, are under constant review.'
