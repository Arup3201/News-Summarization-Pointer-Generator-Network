Britons heading to Dubai for some Christmas sunshine have been warned to avoid holding hands, kissing or being drunk on the street. 

A campaign by British Embassy staff in the United Arab Emirates this week is a play on the Twas the Night Before Christmas poem, and includes travel advice to help keep Britons out of trouble.

The rhyme - meant for visitors to the Emirates, an oil-rich seven-state federation of former British protectorates - highlights potential cultural pitfalls through the eyes of fictional traveller Stu Nicholas.

‘No holding of hands or Christmas kisses; under the mistletoe, despite amorous wishes,’ goes a festive nugget.

Another says: ‘So time to go home after several spirits neat; but it's a crime for Stu to be drunk on the street.’

The Emirates' biggest and most cosmopolitan city, Dubai, has the most relaxed social codes in the conservative Gulf region.

But foreigners occasionally run afoul of strict decency laws and prohibitions on public intoxication.

British citizens have received jail sentences here after being found guilty of kissing in public and having drunken sex on the beach.

Other foreigners have been prosecuted for exchanging steamy text messages or showing a middle finger to a fellow driver.

The poem is being meted out little by little on Facebook and Twitter accounts operated by Britain's diplomatic missions to the country.

It follows a similar awareness campaign last year centred on the 12 Days of Christmas that included the tweet: ‘On the 5th day of Christmas my friend said to me; If I have overdone it, please send me home.’

Millions of foreign tourists each year are drawn to the Emirates by beaches with nearly year-round sunshine and  attractions such as the Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building.

More than 100,000 British citizens live in the Emirates, and about a million visit the country each year, according to the embassies in Abu Dhabi and Dubai.

Twas the night before flying, at Stu Nicholas’s house,

Off to the Emirates, along with his spouse.

The cases were full, but packed with ill care,

Banned medication inside - a customs nightmare!

He forgot to check FCO travel advice, For that he might pay an almighty price.

Twas the Night Before Flying:

With visa in passport and job contract signed,

A place of safe hiding, Stu looked to find.

He placed carefully his passport in a safe place

And carried around a copy that he brought in his case 

 

Twas the Night Before Flying:

To the work Christmas party, off Stu went,

For an evening of dancing and merriment.

No holding of hands, or Christmas kisses,

Under the mistletoe, despite amorous wishes.

So time to go home after several spirits neat,

But it’s a crime for Stu to be drunk on the street

Stu's adventure continues:

He called for a taxi to get a ride back.

The driver was sullen, with no Christmas crack.

But Stu was polite and kept his calm,

And this gave the driver no cause for alarm.

So Stu makes it home to his new bed.

No prison this time, just a sore head!
