An Arizona man lost his entire family - three young children, his mother and pregnant sister - when the truck they were riding in collided with an 18-wheeler on an interstate highway over the weekend.

'I'm burying my whole family,' Larry Curley said, crying as he spoke outside his home on Monday, CBS5 reported.

His daughters, seven-year-old Brianna and nine-year-old Kayla and his son, 12-year-old Tyler, were killed in the crash on Interstate 10 in Picacho Peak, Arizona.

Mr Curley's sister, Danielle Blackmore, 20, who was several months' pregnant, and mother, Shelley Renee Blackmore, 49, also died, authorities said.

Mr Curley's father, Tracy William Blackmore, 47, who was driving was the only survivor inside the truck. He was airlifted to a hospital and was in critical condition as of Tuesday.

Mr Blackmore lost control of the truck after its front left tire tread separated. The truck went across a median and into oncoming traffic where it collided with the 18-wheeler. A passenger car also struck the pickup Mr Blackmore was driving.

Mr Curley told reporters Tyler loved baseball and Kayla and Brianna, were cheerleaders.

'They were an absolutely beautiful family,' Mr Curley's aunt, Kim Tricarico. 'My sister (Shelly Blackmore) loved her grandbabies, his children.'

An account named the Blackmore and Curley Memorial Fund will begin accepting donations at any Bank of America branch starting Tuesday afternoon.

The driver of the 18-wheeler was hospitalized with minor injuries. The co-driver was not hurt, nor were the driver and passenger of the third vehicle.
