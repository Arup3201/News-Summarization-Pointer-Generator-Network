A third of women who gave birth in Blackpool last year smoked while they were pregnant.

New figures released show a clear North-South divide, with mothers-to-be in London the least likely to smoke.

The research, from Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC), also show that one in five of the women who gave birth in North East England last year also classed themselves as a smoker when they had their baby.

This was the highest level of smoking among pregnant women in the North East for six years.

The lowest was in London where about one in 17 pregnant women smoked.

London has had the lowest proportion of smoking mothers-to-be nationally for each of the last six years.

Across England as a whole, the report showed that there has been a steady fall in the number of women who smoke during pregnancy since 2006.

The highest proportion of mothers-to-be who smoked was in Blackpool, where one in three women smoked during pregnancy. The lowest was in London where one in 17 smoked

HSCIC Chief Executive Alan Perkins 
said: ‘Today’s figures show that while fewer pregnant women are smoking 
across England, mothers in the North East have been top of the smoker’s 
prevalence table for six years running.

FIVE WORST AREAS

1. Blackpool - 30.8%

2. Middlesbrough - 26.2%

3. South Tyneside - 26.1%

4. Redcar and Cleveland - 24.2%

5. North-East Lincolnshire - 23.9%

FIVE BEST AREAS

1. Westminster - 2.3%

2. Richmond and Twickenham - 2.5%

3. Tower Hamlets - 3%

4. Hammersmith and Fulham - 3.5%

5. Hounslow - 3.8%

‘Today’s
report is crucial for addressing those regions and PCTs where the rates
of smoking during pregnancy are particularly high and are likely to 
alert local-level health professionals.’

The news comes just one month after 
it was revealed that health watchdog NICE has proposed all midwives be 
told to test mothers-to-be to establish whether they smoke.

In the proposals, which are due to come 
into force this year, midwives will be told to test mothers’ carbon 
monoxide levels at their first antenatal appointment.

This will reveal if they are being honest about whether they smoke, with those found to have high readings given ‘appropriate support’ on how to quit.

According to the NHS, women who smoke during pregnancy are more likely to experience morning sickness and complications during pregnancy.

They are more likely to have a stillborn or premature baby and are also more likely to have an underweight newborn.

It is also believed that babies born to women who smoke are at greater risk of cot death and asthma.
