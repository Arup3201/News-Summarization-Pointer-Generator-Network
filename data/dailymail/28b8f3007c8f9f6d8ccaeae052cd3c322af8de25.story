A woman lies face down on a bed, blood stains are splattered up the white bathroom walls and furniture is strewn across the living room - but this isn't an episode of CSI.

Behind the walls of this regular-looking four-bedroomed semi-detached house in Derby, East Midlands, is actually a training facility for the next generation of forensic investigators.

Mocked up to look like any other house on a suburban street, the £410,000 provision has been purpose built at the University of Derby and comes complete with an array of mysteries.

Crime scene: Student Sarah-Jane Smith analyses the mock murder scene after finding a 'body' face down on the bed at the forensic training facility at the University of Derby

The facility is purpose-built inside a former four-bedroom family home opposite the campus and comes with seven replica crime scenes, including a living room (pictured)

Student are closely monitored via CCTV cameras by their tutors as they analyse clues scattered around what was previously a family home, close to the campus.

Their task is to gather as much information from the scene as possible, without disturbing or contaminating vital evidence, that can be later used in a court trial.

Senior tutor, Jon Wright, who previously worked for the Metropolitan Police, said the rules of forensics are ABC - 'Assume Nothing, Believe No One and Challenge Everything'.

'The first rule is safety. You must make sure that you're safe and it is safe to enter. The second rule is to make sure that it is secure by checking the entry and protecting any other exit,' he said.

'The ABC rules should be going through your head as well as the six Ws - who, what, where, when, why and how. 

'A crime scene is not a sterile environment and you need to remember you can change the environment from the minute you walk in.

'As the first forensic scientist to examine the scene, you are seeing something that can never be repeated, and which you have to make the most of,' he said.

The house also comes with a chemist shop in one room and students are advised to look for evidence that may be out of context, while trying to disturb any potential clues

The three-year course is more than just poking around a four-bedroom house in white overalls. 

As well as practical lessons in the laboratory and field, there are also more traditional theory-based lectures in areas including biology, chemistry and law.

Students cover key forensic practices such as crime scene investigations, human tissue analysis and fingerprint analysis. 

Lessons in blood pattern analysis, firearms and fire investigation and how entomology and tissue decay can help the forensic scientist is also taught.

The University of Derby offers its students the practical scenarios at its house (featured) and also a crime scene car, before presenting the findings in its mock courtroom.

Not all students go on to work as crime scene investigators but the qualification opens up doors for those hoping to work in the criminal justice system, for local constabularies or for forensic science providers like Rolls Royce and AstraZeneca.

Alternatively, people may choose to go on and work for law firms, private forensic laboratories or insurance companies. 

The emphasis on chemistry and molecular biology also opens opportunities for studying medicine. 

He continued: 'Every crime scene is different, so we set up the scenes to mimic ones we have seen in the past in our work or completely new ones and see how the students would handle it.

'It's a normal house so it's really flexible in how we set it up - there's also a small shop which we can adapt and distribute evidence.'

Mr Wright said that the most important thing for any crime scene investigator is to be aware of their attention to detail.

'Everything is potential forensic evidence and while you are looking for things that are there, you must also be looking for things that aren't, which can be taken back to the lab and examined.

'Looking for things out of context, like a mark on the wall or an item that might be missing, it's those things that could be crucial.' 

All the trainees wear proper overalls and gloves so as not to contaminate any evidence, which is put in clear bags (left) and they also properly measure blood splatters to give them more clues on what happened

They are closely monitored by their tutors using CCTV, so that they can work on the scene independantly

He also said that students are looking for less obvious things such as a biro that could have fingerprints or a blank piece of paper that could bear an imprint.

Mr Wright added: 'You only get one chance to do a crime scene so anything that could be potential evidence must be gathered.' 

Within the house, which was completed last month, are seven replica crime scenes - a bedroom, bathroom, office, shop, garage and living room, as well as a 'blood pattern analysis room'.

Mr Wright added that the blood is actually sterile horse blood, which has the 'same appearance and reacts similarly to human blood'.

Once the evidence has been gathered, students are then encouraged to present their findings in the on-campus mock 'courtroom', to further mimic the real-life procedure. 

They are given training in law, criminology and the criminal justice system, and the facility is also open to law and criminology students. 

Along with 180 undergraduates currently on the BSc Forensic Science course, the facility is also used by emergency service teams and Derbyshire Constabulary for staff training.

Students previously shared a unit with the police but now they have their own purpose-built facility, which Mr Wright described as 'perhaps one of the best in the country'.

One student, Sarah-Jane Smith, 34, joined the course after spending 10 years as a special needs teacher. 

'I thought it sounded an interesting job, but when I came here on an Open Day, I found to my surprise that I just couldn't tear myself away from the forensic department stand. And here I am,' she told the paper. 

Television programmes like CSI and Silent Witness fuelled a surge in the number of people taking up a forensic science degree, research has previously found.

The facility cost £410,000 and was opened last month. It may look like a regular house from the outside but inside it is littered with potential evidence from a murder

Along with 180 undergraduates currently on the BSc Forensic Science course, the facility is also used by emergency service teams for staff training

A report in 2009 revealed that the number of universities offering the degree had risen from two in 1990 to 285.

The report cited the TV detective programmes as the reason for the escalation in popularity.

Dr. Ian Turner, head of forensic science, said: 'Having this resource onsite allows us to give our students the skills needed to develop a career in forensic science because they are learning in a real life context, with the same equipment and facilities used by professionals'

'The staff on the teaching team are also a major asset. The academics leading the project have nearly 30 years of commercial forensic experience between them in addition to their academic expertise, and can share their skills and knowledge with the students.'

University of Derby Online Learning, which allows students from all over the world to gain a degree from home, has also used the facility to film a 360 degree virtual crime scene.

Students can navigate the scene remotely, collecting and analysing evidence then write and prepare a statement of evidence for a court of law.

Forensic science students at the University of Derby also have access to a forensic car, which is treated like a crime scene in a similar way

Students are then asked to present their evidence before a mock jury at the on-site courtroom as part of their assessment

Once the students have collected as much as evidence as they can they are encouraged to present their findings in the university's mocked up court room - also on campus
