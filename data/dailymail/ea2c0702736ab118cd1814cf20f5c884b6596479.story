Queen of the raunchy read Jackie Collins described her successful writing career as not bad 'for a school dropout' as she was awarded an OBE.

Collins, whose older sister is the actress Joan Collins, has consistently produced best sellers since her first book was published in the late 1960s.

They are filled with tales about the glamorous sex lives of its rich and famous protagonists and include The World Is Full Of Married Men, The Stud and Hollywood Wives.

'Not bad for a school dropout!' Author Jackie Collins holds her OBE medal, after it was presented to her by the Queen at Buckingham Palace today

The author flew to London this week from her Californian home to attend the Buckingham Palace investiture ceremony hosted by the Queen.

She said: 'My first book was The World Is Full OF Married Men - banned all over the world.

'The Queen said 'it's quite something to write books' and I said 'yes especially for a school drop out'.'

She added laughing: 'I was wondering 
what she was going to say to me because most women say 'oh you taught me
 everything I know about sex, I used to read my mum's copy under the 
covers in bed' - but I don't think she would say that to me.

'I've been writing for so long but relationships never change that's the thing, love never changes, sex never changes.'

Collins
 was born in London and started writing while she was a teenager - 
dreaming up stories to entertain her school friends before dropping out 
of education.

As a member of a showbusiness family, she followed her sister into acting with minor parts in a string of low budget movies and television shows, but gave it up when her first novel was an immediate best-seller.

Her Hollywood series of books have been popular as have the novels chronicling the life of her character Lucky Santangelo.

Collins also hosted her own chat show called Jackie Collins Hollywood and is still a prolific writer publishing Confessions of a Wild Child earlier this year.

The author said: 'I think the appeal of my books is the characters, people love the characters. My previous book The Power Trip was about all new characters - there were English Characters, Australian characters, Mexican gangsters it was a whole mix and people loved that book.

'I think the secret is I love what I do, I wake up every morning and it's an adventure.

'And coming here is a huge adventure, I'm British through and through and to meet the Queen and come to the palace is great, I've brought my three granddaughters and they're loving it.'

British rower Sarah Outen, who paddled for 150 days on a solo feat from Japan to Alaska, was awarded an MBE for services to rowing, conservation and charity.

The adventurer arrived in Adak in the Aleutian Islands in September after rowing some 3,750 nautical miles in her boat Happy Socks.

Ms Outen, from Rutland, Leicestershire, is believed to be the first person to complete the voyage, which saw her propose to her girlfriend during the trek on a satellite phone.

Brave: Sarah Outen was the first woman and the youngest person to row solo across the Indian Ocean and also singlehandedly took on the Pacific Ocean from Japan to Alaska 

The 
gruelling trip forms part of a round-the-world expedition. She hopes to 
eventually circle the globe using only human power: cycling, rowing and 
kayaking more than 20,000 miles.

After
 the ceremony, Ms Outen said she would travel back to Adak: 'I hope to 
return in May next year and kayak to the nearest road - which is 1,400 
miles away on the mainland.

'Then I'll cycle across to the east coast of Canada, then I'll row home in 2015 across the Atlantic.'

Her
 happiness at being presented with the MBE was tinged with sadness: 
'It's obviously great to come here today to receive this. It would have 
been my father's birthday as well, who died seven years ago now, so to 
receive it on his birthday is very special.'
