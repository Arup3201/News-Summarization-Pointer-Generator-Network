This is the moment an inmate decided to punch a prison officer because he simply 'wanted to fight someone'.

Ceasar Ruben Meraz made the bizarre statement after already having been arrested for allegedly attacking four students outside a high school in Mesa, Arizona.

The 25-year-old then decided that one tussle was not enough, as footage shows him punching one prison guard before tussling with others.

A group of five officers eventually restrained the man, who is seen lying face-down with his hands behind his back at the end of the confrontation.

Police say the four students were 
assaulted at 6:40 am on Wednesday.

A report said that no weapons were 
involved in the incident and that none of the students sustained severe injuries.

Meraz, who is understood to be a former Mesa High student, faces three possible felony and six possible misdemeanor charges.

Police also claimed that he attacked a detention officer while he was being booking into Mesa City Jail.
