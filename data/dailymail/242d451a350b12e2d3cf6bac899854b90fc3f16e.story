A proud father is celebrating delivering both his children himself at home, having just brought his second son into the world.

And Rob Keeling, 38, had to think extra quickly while helping his girlfriend Jodie Pointon, 31, when she went into labour in the couple's bedroom on Sunday night, because baby Archy had the umbilical cord wrapped around his tiny neck.

But having already delivered Archy's brother Bobby on the family sofa in 2006, Rob, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, was able to react calmly, carefully untying the cord and pulling Archy to safety.

Rob realised paramedics were not going to arrive in time after he dialled 999 when Jodie began having close contractions, and was forced to deliver 7lb 4oz Archy on the couple's bed at 11.10pm.

The delighted father-of-two, said despite the hiccup with the umbilical cord, his latest delivery was much easy than the first.

He said: 'Everything happened so quickly that I can't really remember much about it. Jodie said she wasn't going to make it to the hospital, so I just went into auto-pilot. It was all a bit of a shock.

'It took barely two minutes before Archy was out, the moment he popped out the paramedics were at the door.

'The first time it happened I was scared, but having been through that it wasn't so bad a second time. I never thought in a million years I would be delivering another baby!'

Jodie had been having contractions through the day and went upstairs to rest. Rob told her to let him know if anything happened but she had barely reached the top of the staircase when she shouted that the baby was coming.

'He came out so fast I just delivered him there and then on the bed,' Rob said. 'Then I saw that the chord was wrapped round his neck and I knew that was dangerous, I had to gently try and free him or he might have died.

'He's a beautiful baby, perfectly healthy despite me delivering him, but I'm just glad I had some experience in delivering him.'

Jodie added: 'We called the hospital at about 10.30pm to say we were on our way, but suddenly I knew we weren't going to be able to get there. My mum came and rang an ambulance, but Archy just came out so quick.

'Delivering a baby at home was a bit of a shock for Rob when it happened the first time, but not so much this time. You just get on with it. We were all fine afterwards and Archy has been really good.'

Archy's grandmother Jill Mellor, 55, from Fegg Hayes, Northamptonshire, said: 'I'm dead proud of Rob - he did really well. There aren't many dads who can say they have delivered both their children.'

Rob had only just phoned 999 when Archy's mother Jodie announced she wasn't going to be able to wait and Rob was going to have to help her deliver the baby alone in the house without any medical help
