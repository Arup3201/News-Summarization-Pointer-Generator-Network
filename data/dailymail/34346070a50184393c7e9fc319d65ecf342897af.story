A man has been arrested in connection with the kidnapping of a ten-year-old girl who was snatched from her San Fernando Valley home in the middle of the night and abandoned hours later, police said on Monday.

Daniel Martinez, 29, was taken into custody on Sunday in Northridge and booked for investigation of kidnapping. He was being held on $1 million bail.

Tobias Dustin Summers, a transient with a long criminal record, was also identified by authorities over the weekend as a suspect in the case.

Police initially said they were looking for two suspects but noted they were focusing their efforts on Summers.

The connection between Summers and Martinez wasn't immediately clear.

The girl was abducted around 3am last Wednesday and found 12 hours later wandering near a Starbucks several miles away.

She was barefoot, had bruises and scratches, and wasn't wearing the same clothes she had on when she vanished.

Investigators have said they believe the girl was driven around the San Fernando Valley in a couple of cars and taken to at least two locations, including a storage facility, before she was released.

The Los Angeles Times reported that law enforcement sources said the girl was sexually assaulted.

Police
noted Summers had a criminal history dating back to 2002 and had been 
arrested for robbery, grand theft auto, possession of explosives and 
kidnapping.

Authorities haven't given a motive for the kidnapping.

They don't believe Summers and the family knew one another.

Summers was believed to have been let out of prison as part of a program to ease overcrowding in California jails.

Anyone with information on Summers is asked to call the Robbery Homicide tipline at 213-486-6890.Â  Anyone who has a sighting of Summers is urged to call 911 immediately.
