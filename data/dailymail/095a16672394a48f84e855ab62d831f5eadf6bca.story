For the first time in recent memory, the sack race is a non-starter. Those Premier League bosses who looked a dead cert for the chop at the tail end of the last season have done enough to survive so far.

Sam Allardyce, wanted out by West Ham fans for the majority of the past year, has seen a miraculous turnaround at Upton Park, with his happy Hammers sitting fifth.

Paul Lambert, despite a good start to the campaign, has overseen another Villa slide but remains in the hot seat and was even given a brand-spanking new four-year deal in September.

Alan Irvine at West Brom hangs on, while Alan Pardew fought through the calls for his head at the start of the campaign to guide Newcastle to five Premier League wins in a row. 

Ian Porterfield was sacked as Chelsea boss on February 15, 1993; the longest time between the season starting and a sacking in top flight history

If those hanging by a thread keep hold of their jobs by Monday, it will be the first time since 1996 that the Premier League has reached this stage of the season without a sacking.

Chris Hughton lost his job at Newcastle, somewhat surprisingly, on December 6, 2010, just months after he guided them back to the Premier League from the second tier.

A weekend survival would cast memories back 18 years, when Roy McFarland was axed as Bolton boss on January 2, 1996. Happy New Year, Roy.

The record for the longest season of bosses clinging on for dear life is 1992-93. Chelsea held fire until after they exchanged Valentine's Day gifts with Ian Porterfield before getting rid on February 15, 1993.

Irvine and Leicester's Nigel Pearson lead the sack race with the bookies, and both will want to get to Christmas without their P45s.

West Brom sit in 16th place with just three wins all season, and Irvine's side travel to Hull City on Saturday, with their man at the helm Steve Bruce also in the danger zone with just one win in 13 games this term.

Newly promoted Leicester go to Aston Villa on Sunday, with the fans just starting to turn against Pearson during the difficult winter period.

The axe could be about to fall...
