Diego Costa says he is signing for Chelsea because they 'are one of the greatest clubs in the world'.

The Atletico Madrid striker has long been expected to join Jose Mourinho's side in a £32million deal and the 25-year-old has revealed the move is close to being completed.

'Why would I have chosen to play for Chelsea? It is a thing that is about to happen,' Costa told Goal.com. 'Things are going in a direction and, if they keep going as they are going, it is the team I will play for in the next season.

'I've wanted to play in the Premier League for a while. Chelsea are one of the greatest clubs of the world so there are many factors that make you take a decision like this.'

Costa, who is currently at the World Cup with Spain, scored 36 goals in all competitions last season to help Atletico win La Liga and reach the Champions League final. But he admitted it will take time for him to adapt to English football.

He said: 'Every year is a different story, nothing is easy in life. I will have to work a lot to fit in with the style of the Premier League.'

Having chosen to play for Spain over his native Brazil, Costa was booed by local fans during Spain's 5-1 defeat to Holland but says the criticism does not affect him.

He has also backed the reigning world champions to bounce back from last Friday's thrashing.

He said: 'In Spain it happens to me in every stadium I play so I'm pretty much accustomed to it. I had my right of choice so it's the same for the public, they have the right to choose to boo me. When you are on the pitch you don't think about those things. I saw it coming, I knew it was going to happen so I had my head ready for that.

'It was a tough loss [but] a match like this happens here and then. There is a positive side which is that we still have a chance so we have to keep our heads up because there are two finals to be played. There is nothing better than a next match to try to forget this one.'
