More than 600 students at the University of Derby have been put at risk of infection with HIV and hepatitis

Six hundred students have been put at risk of HIV and hepatitis because a healthcare worker failed to followed correct clinical procedures.

Past and present students at the University of Derby - who had either vaccinations or blood tests - have been advised to attend screenings for the infections to ensure they have not been infected.

The advice was given after an investigation was opened into the safety of procedures carried out by a member of staff who was formerly contracted to provide services within the Occupational Health Service at the university.

Experts at NHS England have said the actions of a healthcare worker put students at risk of HIV and hepatitis B and C.

The worker involved failed to change the syringe barrels which needles are attached to between each patient.

This oversight occurred over a period of eight years putting 606 students at risk.

The affected patients are those that were seen by the healthcare worker between September 2005 and October 2013.

Dr Doug Black, Medical Director, NHS England Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire said: ‘This investigation has taken place as it is understood that, whilst syringe needles were always changed between patients, the syringe barrels to which the needles attach were being reused in the administration of vaccinations.

‘This also occurred during blood taking, where a single use holder for a blood collection tube was reused but needles changed.

‘Therefore, there is an extremely low possibility these errors may have put people at risk of infection from hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV.

‘With this in mind, as a precaution, we have reviewed all available university health records and the 606 people identified have all been contacted and invited to attend a blood test at their local hospital or via their GP.’

He added: ‘We are extremely sorry for the undoubted worry and concern people we are contacting may feel on receiving this news.

‘I would however like to stress that the risk is extremely low and would encourage all those we contact, who may not already have been screened after their time at the university, to present themselves for blood testing.

‘As part of our investigation the healthcare worker involved has been reported to the appropriate regulatory body and has been suspended, pending further investigation.

‘We are working closely with the University of Derby and Public Health England to resolve this issue as quickly as possible.’

Professor John Coyne, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Derby said: ‘This is a deeply regrettable incident, and it does mean that we need to contact a significant number of our current and former students to ensure they get the information and guidance they need. I apologise for the potential distress this may cause to the people involved.

‘We are working closely with NHS England and Public Health England to provide support and assistance to those people who may be affected by this issue, and will continue to do so tirelessly in the coming weeks to ensure that all appropriate support is available and provided.

‘An advice line has been set up by the university, with clinical support from Public Health England, to provide advice and guidance to callers.

‘Those who receive a letter are advised to call 03330 142479 for further information on what actions they should take next.’

The investigation is being carried out by NHS England, Public Health England and the University of Derby.
