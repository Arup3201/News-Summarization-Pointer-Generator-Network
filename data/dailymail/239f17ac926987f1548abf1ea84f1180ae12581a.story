Former England striker Gary Lineker has hit out at Roy Hodgson's World Cup tactics and branded the Three Lion's group stage exit in Brazil a 'humiliation'.

Lineker, who played in four major tournaments for England, believes that Hodgson's decision to play 4-2-3-1 instead of 4-3-3 was naive due to his side's lack of experience.

Steven Gerrard's inability to organise and lead the side correctly also contributed to England's first group stage exit since 1958, according to Lineker.

The only positive that he was able to draw from England's World Cup elimination was Hodgson's decision to give the youngsters 'a chance'.

The 53-year-old Match of the Day presenter told Blahzil.com: 'Personally,
 I think Roy got it wrong.

'The system that 
suits this kind of England better, with the lack of experience in it, is
 probably a 4-3-3. He tried 
to just play with two players in the centre of midfield.

'In the first 
game I thought it was better because he had (Raheem) Sterling behind 
(Daniel) Sturridge, and that gave us three because Sterling is more of a
 natural midfield player, certainly than (Wayne) Rooney.

'But I just 
think it is too big an ask for just two central midfield players and 
once again we were outnumbered.

'The
 problem with this 4-2-3-1 is that it very quickly becomes a 4-4-2 or at
 least a 4-4-1-1 and we end up with flat lines and people getting 
between us.

'I think we would have been better - and I said this before 
the tournament - with three midfield players because you've got to give 
yourself a chance defensively.'

Although he was heavily critical of Hodgson's tactics, Lineker did say that he was pleased the England manager blooded some youngsters in tournament conditions.

'You admire him (Hodgson) in many ways for giving youngsters a chance,' he said.

'I
 applaud the fact that he had a go and that's what we all asked for 
wasn't it, that he played faster, positive football, so we can't 
complain too much.'

While calling England's exit a 'humiliation', Lineker criticised Gerrard's 'individual' attitude and his lack or organisational skills.

Lineker, who scored 48 goals in 80 internationals, believes England's 'old guard' of Gerrard and Frank Lampard are 'past their best'.

He said: 'Steven Gerrard, wonderful player that he is, has always been an individual in many ways.

Positive: Blooding youngsters like Raheem Sterling (left) was the only plus point, says Lineker

'He's
 not really a player that can organise or spot problems. He didn't spot 
the danger on England's left side in the first game, which was pretty 
obvious after a few attempts.

'We
 don't have the players who can spot something and deal with it. In my 
era we had Terry Butcher, Ray Wilkins and Bryan Robson - players who 
could spot problems on the pitch and that is something that is missing 
from this crop.'

In reference to Gerrard's failed headed clearance that led to Luis Suarez's winner against England in the 2-1 loss to Uruguay,
 Lineker added: 'It was a schoolboy error that saw England finally go 
home with that dreadful second goal for Luis Suarez.

'Defensively we were not good enough.

'It
 was always the fear before the tournament that we were lightweight at 
the back with little depth, neither of the full-backs were 
defensively-minded full-backs.'
