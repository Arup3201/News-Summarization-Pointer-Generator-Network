Aeroplane meals can be a notoriously hit-and-miss adventure, especially on low-budget airlines.

Starving passengers are often left battling it out for the last ham and cheese toastie or overpriced bacon sandwich.

But in a bid to change that reputation, a low-cost Latvian airline will adopt the world's first 'drag and drop' in-flight ordering system.

Possibilities: Once logged on, passengers are presented with this screen

Do it yourself: Passengers choose their own meal and drag items onto the tray

From May, passengers travelling with Air Baltic log in up to 24 hours before 
boarding and drag items from the menu onto a virtual meal tray and 
create their own slap up dinner.

The gourmet options include a Teriyaki salmon with garlic and potatoes for 9 Euros, a Greek salad with olive oil and lemon for 8 Euros and a glass of 2003 Chateau Ausone red wine for 4 Euros.

At the moment the airline offers 20 pre order meal options and four dietary options including gluten free, lactose free, vegetarian and kosher.

Each option also comes with dietary information such as the number of calories and saturated fat.

Janis Vanags VP of Corporate Communications at Air Baltic told the InFlight Feed Blog: 'With passengers now being able to create their own inflight meal the possibilities are endless, they can fully customise their inflight meal tray to their liking.'

Finished product: There are currently 20 pre-order meal options with Air Baltic

Tasty: Each option comes complete with nutritional information such as how many calories it contains
