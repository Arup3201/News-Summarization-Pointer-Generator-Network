Martin Murray has been written off by bookmakers and pundits alike ahead of his fight against Gennady Golovkin, but his manager has backed the St Helens middleweight to the tune of £5,000.

Murray takes on the unbeaten knockout sensation in Monte Carlo on Saturday in his third world title fight.

And his adviser Andrew Mikhail stands to win £57,500 if he prevails.

Alongside a picture of three bets of £300, £500 and £2,200 placed with three separate bookmakers at odds of 8/1 and 9/1, Mikhail tweeted: 'For the tweeters that have said put my money where my mouth is, here you go...'

He also placed a fourth bet of £2,000 with an online exchange at odds of 13/1.

'I've seen what he has put himself through,' Mikhail told Sportsmail. 'He's been away from his family and sacrificed so much. He's stronger and calmer then he's ever been.'

Murray arrived in the principality on Monday after spending five weeks at altitude in Johannesburg.

He will be joined by 700 loyal fans who will all but fill the salubrious Salle de Etoiles which has a capacity of 1,000.

Ahead of coming face to face with Golovkin at Friday's weigh-in, Murray told Sportsmail: 'I just see the fight as a big job and if I want me and my family to have the lifestyle I want us to have, I have to beat him.

'I'm going to work on the tactics we've come up with. People change when they get hit so I've not just got one game plan, I've got 10, 11, 12...

'I just want to fight, it doesn't bother me who it is. I was in the lift with my manager and I said I wished he was Golovkin!

It might be daunting for some people, but I can't wait.'
