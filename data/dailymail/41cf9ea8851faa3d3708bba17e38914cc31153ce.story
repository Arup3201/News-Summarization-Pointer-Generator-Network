Teachers helped a 15-year-old pupil to have an abortion that her parents knew nothing about.

Her mother and father finally learned about the termination when she told them after it had happened.

Last night family campaigners said the case showed how parents are increasingly being sidelined by the law.

It is understood that the girl went to a hospital where it was confirmed she was pregnant. In line with her wishes, doctors did not tell her parents but notified the school in Salford, Greater Manchester, instead.

Teachers discussed the termination with the girl, checking she was comfortable with her decision. They also gave her time off school and supported her when she went for the procedure.

Under the law, teachers, doctors and nurses can offer sexual advice or treatment – including an abortion – to children without telling their parents as long as the child is considered mature enough to make the decision.However, they must ensure that every effort is made to encourage a young person to involve their parents in the decision.

In the Salford case, it is believed the girl did not want her parents to know because she was embarrassed and ashamed. John Merry of Salford Council said: ‘There are very clear and stringent national guidelines for schools to follow in these situations.’

But Michaela Aston of pro-life charity LIFE and a teacher for more than 25 years, said it was ‘high time to worry’ when schools get involved with abortions behind parents’ backs.

She said: ‘When parents leave their children at the school door, they have an implicit trust that this institution will act in the best interest of their children without leaving them out of the equation.

‘Parents are informed and required to give written consent if their child takes a simple pill such as an aspirin at school. Why should a medical procedure that is much more serious be done in secret?’

Norman Wells, director of the Family Education Trust, said parents are becoming increasingly sidelined in the name of ‘the right of the child to confidentiality’.

He said: ‘Parental responsibilities are being usurped by those whose interest in them is professional rather than personal.

‘They are not encouraging them to value and respect their parents and they are failing to recognise that young people generally want to conceal things when they are doing something that is not good for them.’
