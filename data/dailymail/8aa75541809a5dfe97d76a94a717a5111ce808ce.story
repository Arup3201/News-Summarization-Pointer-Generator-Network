Human remains have been recovered by search teams involved in the hunt for missing Irish vet Catherine Gowing, it emerged today.

Ms Gowing, 37, was last seen on the evening of Friday, October 12 at a supermarket near her home in New Brighton, Flintshire, north Wales.

A spokesman for North Wales Police said: 'Following information received by members of the public, recent searches have focused on fields in Manor Road, Sealand.

'Yesterday, search team officers discovered human remains in a shallow pool within the field known locally as the Lum.

'At this time, those remains have yet to be formally identified as this will require medical as well as forensic examination. A post-mortem is planned for later today.

'At this time, we are not able to 
comment further. However, Catherine Gowing’s family have been informed 
of this distressing development and clearly our thoughts are with them 
at this very difficult time. I would ask that they be allowed privacy to
come to terms with this news.'

Ms Gowing, who is originally from 
Clonlee, Co Offaly, in the Irish Republic, had worked at Evans 
Veterinary Practice in Mold for the last 18 months.

She was described by her sister Emma as a 'beautiful person'.

Detective Chief Inspector Mark Pierce said his investigation team continues to urge potential witnesses to come forward.

He
said: 'This development came about as the result of information from 
the local community, for which I am very grateful. However, I am once 
again asking for their assistance.

'The search for evidence relating to 
Catherine’s disappearance continues and I am very eager to hear of any 
sightings of her Irish-registered Renault Clio 00D 99970 and Sharp’s 
black Volvo S40 AG58 JHE since Friday October 12 and particularly in the
Sealand area.

'In fact, I 
would like to hear from anyone who saw any suspicious activity in fields
in Manor Road, Sealand, to contact police on 101.'

Clive
Sharp, 46, of no fixed address, has been charged with murder and was 
remanded in custody until January 7 when he is due to enter his plea.
