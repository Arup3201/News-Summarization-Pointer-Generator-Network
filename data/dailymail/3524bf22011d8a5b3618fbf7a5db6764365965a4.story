A middle-aged accounts manager claims he was forced by a female boss to dress up as Father Christmas while working at Dow Jones because he was older than everyone else. 

James McClellan, 53, claims he was forced out of the company because of  sexism and ageism at the hands of a younger female manager.

He is now suing the financial news and publishing giant claiming he was sidelined as an accounts payable manager for the company in London, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch.

In documents lodged at the Central London Employment Tribunal, the father-of-three from Maidstone in Kent, said he was painted as a 'misogynist' and told by his manager Azmina Airi that he underestimated 'the girls'.

But he insists he was just raising 'grave concerns' his team was being overstretched, and said he was made to feel singled out by Ms Airi.

In the statement he said: 'At our first meeting she informed me that she had been observing me and was of the view that I was 'rigid and stuck in my ways'.

'I found this offensive suggesting that she was judging me on the basis of my age and her pre-conception of how set in their ways a middle aged person is.

'At Christmas 2013 she demanded that I dress up as the secret Santa. I was given no option and again felt that I was being discriminated against on the basis of age. I found the experience uncomfortable.'

He added: 'She selected me because I was the 'nice old buffer' everyone liked. I would be happy to suffer the embarrassment.'

Mr McClellan began working at Dow Jones in May 2011 to manage accounts payable.

In October 2013 Ms Airi joined the team and became his manager, overseeing the roll-out of a new payroll system.

But Mr McClellan raised concerns the team could not cope with the new demands being placed on them.

He said: 'The team were at their very limits and subjected to, what I considered, dangerously high levels of stress. I was concerned for the welfare of my team.'

He said the team had to take on pension administration responsibilities, but he felt they 'did not have the capacity training or skills to take this on at this time'

He said: 'I raised this with her and asked her to defer these incremental changes until the project was ended and there would be more time to get this done properly.

'She flatly refused stating that I was being deliberately uncooperative and that I underestimated the ability of 'the girls'.

'I found this very offensive as she was implying that as a middle aged man I was a misogynist with little respect for the abilities of women.

' I find this an offensive stereotype.'

He said the pair had meetings to clear the air, 'but because of her discriminatory views of me as a middle aged man she was completely unwilling to listen to my concerns'.

He branded the workplace an 'ageist environment'. 

He said his job had been made impossible and he resigned in February last year.

He is claiming constructive dismissal, age and sex discrimination, and whistleblowing.

Dow Jones deny the allegations.

The tribunal continues.
