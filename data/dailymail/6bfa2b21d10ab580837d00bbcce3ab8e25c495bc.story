A chef on trial for 
his wife's murder told investigators that they couldn't find his wife's 
body because he had cooked it for four days in boiling water until 
little was left but her skull.

Los
Angeles Superior Court jurors heard David Viens make the statement in a
recorded interview with sheriff's investigators that was played in 
court on Tuesday during his murder trial.

'I
just slowly cooked it and I ended up cooking her for four days,' Viens 
could be heard saying on the recording, according to the Los Angeles Times.

'For some reason I just got violent': David Viens has pleaded not guilty to the murder of his wife Dawn

Viens
gave detectives the interview as he lay in a hospital bed in March 
2011, after leaping off an 80-foot cliff in Rancho Palos Verdes when he 
learned he was a suspect in the late 2009 disappearance of his wife, 
Dawn Viens, 39, whose body was never found.

Viens,
whose injuries from the leap have him attending his trial in a 
wheelchair, said in the interview that he stuffed his wife's body in a 
55-gallon drum of boiling water, keeping it submerged with weights and 
mixing what remained with other waste before disposing of it.

He said the only thing left was his wife's skull, which he stashed at his mother's house.

But
a search of the house turned up nothing, nor did an excavation of his 
restaurant Thyme Contemporary Cafe in Lomita, Los Angeles.

On
the recording played in court, sheriff's Sgt. Richard Garcia asked 
Viens what happened on Oct. 18, 2009, the night his wife disappeared.

'For some reason I just got violent,' said Viens, who has pleaded not guilty to murder.

The trial against Viens opened last week, with his daughter 
Jacqueline telling the court that her father had previously joked that cooking someone was a good way to get rid of the body.

On trial: David Viens told investigators they couldn't find his wife's body because he had cooked it for four days in boiling water until little was left but her skull

Jacqueline, 22, recalled the conversation
she had with her father one night in 2009. She recalled him saying that
Dawn Viens had been needling him and he just wanted to sleep.

He'd tried barricading their bedroom 
door with a dresser but when that didn't work, he tied her up and taped 
her mouth. The next morning, Dawn Viens was dead.

She said her father told her, through tears, that her body would never be found.

When he was arrested, he told investigators a similar story.

Defense attorney Fred McCurry 
questioned Jacqueline's account of the conversation, saying she had both drank 
and smoked marijuana the night it took place and her memory was 'fuzzy'.

She did testify that she had never seen the couple argue and they 'seemed like they loved each other'.

Viens claims his wife ran away to the 
mountains from their restaurant 16 months ago after an argument over 
whether she should go for drug rehabilitation.

But
authorities were suspicious because of ‘inconsistent statements’ he 
gave and the fact she left behind her wallet, mobile phone and other 
personal belongings.

His new girlfriend, Kathy Galvan, then 
took over Mrs Viens’s job and moved into her home, before he was seen 
throwing out his wife’s belongings into a dustbin behind his restaurant,
police said.

Speaking about this, Jacqueline said 
she had been asked by her father to bag up Dawn's clothes and take them 
to a storage unit. The rest were thrown out.

The 22-year-old also said that Dawn Viens was no saint.

'She'd wake up in the morning and drink all day long,' adding that the pair had done cocaine together.  

She also told jurors that 
after the 'drunken confession', her father asked her to send a text 
message from Dawn Viens' phone to one of his wife's friends saying: 
'This is Dawn. I'm OK. I'm in Florida and I'm here to start over.'

Then she got rid of the phone to protect her dad.

Suicide bid? The cliffs near the Point Vicente Interpretive Center in Rancho Palos Verdes in California. Viens jumped over cliffs in the area as he was being chased by police, falling 80ft, but 'amazingly' survived

Police upgraded the case from a missing person case to a homicide after they found blood inside Viens apartment.

They
had been looking for him when they saw the suspect and Kathy Galvan in 
his car on a road near the coastline by Point Vicente Interpretive 
Center near Rancho Palos Verdes.

He
sped off to a lighthouse car park, jumped out and began grappling with 
Ms Galvan before officers tried to intervene. But Viens broke free and 
seemed to purposely leap off the cliff to the beach below.

‘Viens
dove off a 100ft cliff to avoid talking to our detectives, and that is 
somewhat telling,’ Sheriff's Department detective chief Bill McSweeney 
said.

He was placed in a medically-induced coma but ultimately survived the attempt - though with critical injuries.
