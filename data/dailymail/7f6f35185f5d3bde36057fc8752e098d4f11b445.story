Police in Wisconsin have issued a stark warning to motorists to stay inside their cars if they have broken down on the freeway - or alternatively get as far away as possible.

The message comes after several people were hurt while waiting for police to arrive after a minor crash on Milwaukee's Zoo Interchange.

Four motorists had been standing at the on ramp's edge when a car span out as it sped past and slammed into one of their parked vehicles, knocking them down like skittles.

Safety first: The footage was released by the Milwaukee Sheriff's Office and Wisconsin Highway Patrol to reinforce their message that motorists who break down on the highway should wait in their cars for help

To reinforce the message the Milwaukee Sheriff's Office and Highway patrol have released a shocking video of the incident on Tuesday, which left two people in hospital.

Two others suffered minor cuts and bruises in the smash and a fifth, who remained inside the van, was unhurt.

Wisconsin state trooper Robert Simpson told CBS 58 News that the safest thing to do in the event of a crash on the highway is to stay inside your vehicle.

He said: 'You want to stay in your car, call 911 - call as many times as you want - until you see law enforcement there.'

He added: 'If you are going to leave your vehicle we advise against it unless the car's on fire. [But] if you're going to leave your vehicle get off the road and go up to the top of the hill.'

The crash highlighted by Wisconsin police was the result a series of chain reaction crashes involving four vehicles that occurred on the west-to-north ramp (I-94 EB to I-45 NB) in the Zoo Interchange, Fox 6 Milwaukee reported.

The first crash happened when the driver of a tan Ford lost control, hit the median and span out until it came to rest facing the wrong way, witnesses told the broadcaster.

Sheriff's officials said that a red van then attempted to avoid the Ford by quickly switching lanes, but collided with a white utility truck as it did so, a smash which pushed it into the first crashed vehicle.

At this stage there were no injuries and all three vehicles were able to move on to the hard shoulder, where four occupants got out and stood on the adjacent verge to assess the damage and wait for police.

That's when the fourth vehicle came speeding up the ramp and lost control, slamming into the parked van which struck the pedestrians before coming to a stop across lanes two and three.

Two people were taken for treatment at Froedtert Hospital.
