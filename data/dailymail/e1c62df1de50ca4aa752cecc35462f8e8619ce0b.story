After four years of legal battles, a tranquil village thought it had finally won the right to evict a travellers camp from a local field - only to be thwarted at the 11th hour because the travellers claimed the eviction was a breach of their human rights.

The locals of Hardhorn in Lancashire, thought they had won their case to have a group of 78 Irish travellers moved on after the fight went all the way from district council meetings to the High Court.

But although an enforcement notice demands the group leave by July 31, a mother living on the site has now taken the travellers' case to the Court of Appeal in London saying the decision 'violates' the human rights of the 39 children staying there.

Angry villagers in Hardhorn wrote to local councillors, raising concerns about noise, road safety and a potential drop in house prices

Around 70 travellers then set up camp after sneaking in during the the dead night in what neighbours described as a 'military-style operation'

Now it is feared the group - who villagers accuse of being 'terrible neighbours' - will be able to remain for several more months whilst an official appeal court judgement is made out.

It is believed local council inspectors have been advised to delay forcing the travellers to move on whilst three top judges decide what happens next.

Local parish councillor Maxine Chew, who has been fighting on behalf of villagers, said: 'It is very very disappointing that the appeal has brought the enforcement notice to a halt.

'All of the people of Hardhorn feel very hard done to. These travellers have made a small village of their own on the green belt.

'The fact that they claim their children’s human rights would be violated is ridiculous because I understand that there are no children at all on the site at the moment anyway.

'The numbers of travellers there changes all of the time. At times there has been up to 60 caravans on the land but through the summer most of the families go off to Europe for work.'

The trouble began in November 2009 after a field in the village was sold by a farmer to a travelling family from West Yorkshire

'The residents in Hardhorn have been very understanding and patient. But the problems they have had to put up with have been non-stop.

'It is nothing to do with the fact that they are travellers. They are illegally there and their behaviour has been hugely disruptive.

'If these people had been good neighbours then we would have been happy to accommodate them but the fact is they have been terrible neighbours.

'The site is a terrible mess, their dogs are forever barking and they have generators running all night.

'The villagers have complained about these people poaching rabbiting and roaming all over their land then harassing them and being rude when told to behave.'

The trouble began in November 2009 after a field in the village - which featured in BBC's Gardeners World - was sold by a farmer to a travelling family from West Yorkshire.

Days before the council's deadline for the travellers to move, an appeal has been lodged meaning that they are now likely to be able to remain for months until an official judgement is made

Around 70 travellers then set up camp after sneaking in during the night in what neighbours described as a 'military-style operation' and after council offices had closed for the weekend

The group of 30 adults and 40 children - mainly from Irish and Scottish families - immediately began work laying foundations under outdoor spot lights.

Angry villagers wrote to local councillors, raising concerns about noise, road safety and a potential drop in house prices with one saying he and his wife had not been able to sleep due to noise from the site.

Officials at Fylde District Council later went to court to stop the group laying hardcore foundations to make their 2.4 hectare site more permanent.

They were granted an injunction banning the travellers from bringing more caravans onto the land but were ordered to allow them to bring water to the site and to use power generators.

In 2010 a county court judge then told the authorities to 'use their best endeavours' to help the travellers get a post code for the Land from the Post Office.

Not welcome: The travellers' presence at the site has upset locals

At the time the travellers argued they needed a postode to help fire and ambulance crews find them if they were in need of an emergency - and the ruling meant they could also apply for state benefits, plus utilities including gas electricity and water.

The travellers then applied for planning permission to stay on the fields for good and proposed to install further utility buildings, cesspools, fencing and hardstandings.

Fylde Council refused the group retrospective planning permission and issued an enforcement notice demanding that they move off the site. An inspector at a planning inquiry also ruled that they had to leave.

A travellers group representative, Elizabeth Collins, then appealed and took the matter to the High Court last September - but another judge ruled the planning inspector's decision should stand. He also ordered Miss Collins to pay £8,000 in costs.

Now, just days before the council’s deadline for the travellers to move, an appeal has been lodged meaning that they are now likely to be able to remain for months until the Court of Appeal has heard the case and made a decision.
