The rapid effects of a life of drugs and run-ins with the police are etched on this former stripper's face - as seen in her collection of police mugshots taken over just 14 months.

Koretha Griffin, 37, was pictured following her arrest last week during a narcotics sting in Austin, Texas which saw 33 drug pushers and buyers locked up. 

Griffin's wild, matted hair, glazed expression and deep crevasses around her mouth reveal a sad decline from the relatively fresh-faced woman she was in her first mugshot on July 4, 2012.

Ravaged: Griffin, a former stripper, has had a litany of drug arrests spanning just 14 months. She is pictured right, on October 14, 2012 and ten days later on October 24 (left)

Griffin was charged earlier this month with possession of drugs listed as Class B or above.

MailOnline was awaiting a call from the Austin Police Department as to the specifics of the charge.

Under Texas law, possession of 2 ounces or less of marijuana is a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by up to 180 days imprisonment and a fine not to exceed $2,000.

It is far from Griffin's first offense and records show that she has a litany of similar drugs-related offenses.

Griffin's sad story begins back on July 4, 2012 when she was charged with possession of marijuana.

Her mugshot 14 months ago, shows Griffin with several face and neck tattoos but looking clear-eyed and fresh-skinned.

In the following months, she has been arrested three separate times on drugs offenses in the Austin area.

Each mugshot shows a marked difference in her appearance - her hair becomes matted, her face  deeply lined and her mouth more turned down in each mugshot.

Although it is unclear what drug problems Griffin has suffered, her face reveals the tragic hallmarks of addiction. Her cheeks are sallow and mouth seems to be collapsing perhaps from missing teeth, making her appear decades older than her 37 years.

Exotic dancing: Kitty Kats 'one on one' strip club on a highway close to Phoenix airport

Griffin's Facebook profile reveals that the 37-year-old is married and a former exotic dancer.

Her workplace is listed as Kittys Club, a small, run-down strip joint on a highway close to Phoenix Airport.

Her interests include 'spending times with friends,' 'partying' and 
'staying up late', according to Facebook.

The sting earlier this month led to offenses ranging from state jail felony to third-degree felony, with bonds ranging from $3,500 to $25,000, reported Chron.com.

Those arrested, ranging in age from 17 to 61, face punishments from 180 days in jail to ten years in prison and fines up to $10,000.

Among the 33 arrested, there have been a combined 1,842 involvements with police.

'The initiative proactively sought out drug dealers and buyers who were preying on the vulnerable population in the downtown area, many of whom seek assistance from social services,' police stated.
