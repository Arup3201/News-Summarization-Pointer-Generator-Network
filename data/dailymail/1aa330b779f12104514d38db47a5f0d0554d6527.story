BROADY IN THE PITTS

Three years ago, Stockport’s Liam Broady beat Aussie Nick Kyrgios in the first round of the boy’s singles here on his way to finishing runner-up.

On Tuesday, 19-year-old Kyrgios faces Rafael Nadal on Centre Court having already banked £117,000, while 20-year-old Broady plays in the first round of a third-tier Futures event in Pittsburgh where the top prize is £845. How the tables have turned.

SAD END FOR KEYS

After leaving the court in tears on Saturday, Madison Keys had to retire from her third-round match against Yaroslava Shvedova on Monday.

The tie was due to resume with Keys down 7-6, 6-6, but the American pulled out shortly before play with a strained abductor muscle.

It is only the second retirement at this year’s event — compared to seven withdrawals in one day on 'Wacky Wednesday' last year.

TEREZA'S QUIDS IN

Czech 19-year-old Tereza Smitkova suffered a tame exit in the fourth round, losing 6-0, 6-2 to compatriot Lucie Safarova, but this was still a life-changing tournament for the world No 175.

Playing in her maiden Grand Slam, qualifier Smitkova earned £117,000 — which is £73,000 more than her career earnings prior to the tournament.

PUNTERS CASH OUT

With demand for tickets higher than ever, it was no surprise that the recent release of Centre Court debenture tickets for 2016-2020 were heavily oversubscribed despite costing £50,000.

And less than two months after they were first marketed, one debenture has been sold on the secondary market for a staggering £141,500.

TSONGA'S CUP JOY

Jo-Wilfried Tsonga was thankful for Kevin Anderson’s late resistance against Andy Murray.

It meant the Frenchman’s tie with Novak Djokovic started after his country had beaten Nigeria 2-0 at the World Cup.

Tsonga didn’t go as far as David Nalbandian who in 2006 asked for an early start to watch Argentina’s clash with Germany.

TIM TRUMPS MURRAY

The BBC’s tennis ball keepy-uppy challenge has proved popular here and Andy Murray looked to have set an unbeatable target with 78, which was 60 more than former Dutch international Clarence Seedorf managed.

Rafael Nadal could only manage 20 before Tim Henman sensationally scored 92 to take the lead.

Murray, who is notoriously competitive at everything, is now keen to have another go..

BULLISH BOULTER

The junior events were hit by the rain with a large number of matches cancelled for the day.

The best British result was 17-year-old Katie Boulter’s 6-3, 6-3 victory over No 13 seed Priscilla Hon.

Freya Christie and Jamie Malik both lost, while Harriet Dart crashed in three sets to No 9 seed Anhelina Kalinina after resuming the match 6-2, 5-5 up.
