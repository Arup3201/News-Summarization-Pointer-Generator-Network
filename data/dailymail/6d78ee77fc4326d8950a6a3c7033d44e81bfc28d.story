At 21ft below the surface, Jules Undersea Lodge in Florida brings a whole new meaning to the phrase sleeping with the fishes.

It's the world's only underwater hotel, where guests can stay overnight for £500 for two – and that includes a Papa John's pizza for dinner.

To reach the lodge, which started life as a research laboratory, guests have to scuba 21ft down into the sea, which is brimming with reef fish, tropical angel fish, snappers and barracuda.

Underwater hotel: Guests have to dive 21ft to reach Jules' Undersea Lodge in Key Largo, Florida

Pizza delivery! Guests can opt to have Papa John's brought down to the hotel from dry land

Inside boasts two bedrooms featuring telephones and DVD players, as well as a lounge, with dining and entertainment areas. Each room boasts a 42inch round window so guests can spend an afternoon watching the underwater life in the Emerald Lagoon.

Ian Koblick, owner and co-developer of the Lodge, said: 'Waking up to view a pair of angelfish looking at you through the bedroom window is a sight you'll never forget.'

Wearing scuba gear, guests enter the lodge, which is filled with compressed air, preventing the water for rising and flooding it, via a 5ft by 7ft entrance in the floor of the building to a wet room, where they get changed.

Once inside the hotel, divers – who must be a qualified scuba diver - are free to roam around, staying overnight or opting for a three-hour trip at £90pp.

Food is provided courtesy of the local pizza delivery company, or guests can book for a chef to dive down and prepare dinner for them.

On the website, Jules Undersea Lodge states: ‘When guests visit Jules' Undersea Lodge in Key Largo, Florida, they discover that the name is no marketing gimmick.

‘Just to enter the Lodge, one must actually scuba dive 21 feet beneath the surface of the sea. ‘Diving through the tropical mangrove habitat of the Emerald Lagoon and approaching the world's only underwater hotel is quite an experience. 

‘Even from the outside, Jules' big 42 inch round windows cast a warm invitation to come in and stay a while, relax and get to know the underwater world that so few of us have even visited.’

The ‘cottage-size’ hotel isn’t short on creature comforts, boasting hot showers, a well-stocked kitchen (complete with refrigerator and microwave), books, music and movies.
