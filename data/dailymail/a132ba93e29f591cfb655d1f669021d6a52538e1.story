The World Cup’s opening game will take place on Thursday without a proper test event that would meet UK legislation requirements at the newly-erected Arena de Sao Paulo.

A junior game was held at the 61,000-seater ground on Sunday but the local fire department’s refusal to approve the temporary seating area that accounts for around 20,000 seats meant nobody could sit in that part of the ground.

On Monday night FIFA were still preparing a statement on the situation but it is true that special machinery has been used to test the strength of the stand.

Ready? The Arena de Sao Paulo stadium will host the opening game of the 2014 World Cup

Not long to go: A junior game was held at the stadium on Sunday

Working: With just two days to go before the World Cup kicks off, Brazil is racing to get its stadiums ready

Whether, however, that is representative of 20,000 football supporters at a match between hosts Brazil and Croatia remains to be seen. The tests the stadium has so far been subjected to certainly don’t meet standards in the UK.

UK stadia are governed by ‘The Green Guide’, which is a range of legislation that forms the granting of a licence.

Central to the process, say stadia experts in the UK, is ‘the testing of stadia life safety systems’.

Early stages: Two people were killed by a collapsed crane during the stadium's construction

That involves holding an ‘appropriate number’ of test events with recommendations that they should be undertaken at 30 per cent capacity, 60 per cent capacity and a test event at or around 100 per cent. Even with temporary seating the strict rules apply.

During the construction of the Arena de Sao Paulo two people were killed when a crane collapsed onto the roof.

Workmen were still racing to finish the stadium on Monday, although it appeared to be little more than finishing touches.

The Arena de Sao Paulo staged four test events at different capacities. The test events mainly serve to evaluate flows and test services for the spectators and the match operation.

The license to operate the FIFA World Cup matches at the Arena de Sao Paulo as well as the safety and security licenses are due to be published tomorrow in line with standard Brazilian procedures.

FIFA and the Local Organising Committee (LOC) rely on the urban mobility planning presented by host city Sao Paulo, which includes not only the usual means of transportation but also contingency plans in case of one of the modals is unavailable or partially working.

What FIFA and the LOC always stress is the importance of fans to plan their way to the stadium and leave early for the match, what avoids arriving too close to kick-off and allow them to enjoy all the attractions offered at the stadium, which on 12 June will also include the opening ceremony, at 15.15.

Pressure: Neymar and his Brazil team-mates open the World Cup with their game against Croatia on Thursday

Anticipation: Fans attempt to catch a peek of opening ceremony rehearsals
