The husband of the headmistress at a 
leading boarding school has been banned from teaching after striking up 
an inappropriate relationship with a teenage pupil.

Dr John Triffitt – who is now divorced
 from his wife Jayne – exchanged ‘personal’ text messages, emails and 
phone calls with the ‘highly vulnerable’ girl when she was not yet 16.

He did not teach full time at 
Woldingham School but gave extra tuition to outstanding pupils at the 
£27,000-a-year establishment in Surrey whose old girls include Great 
Gatsby actress Carey Mulligan, 28, and former Tory MP Louise Mensch, 41.

Dr Triffitt, 54, was found guilty of ‘unacceptable professional conduct’ by the Government’s Teaching Agency.

He and his ex-wife jointly own a 
holiday home at Truro in Cornwall, and Dr Triffitt is understood to have
 moved back to the area in recent months.

His relationship with a pupil at 
Woldingham happened some four years ago but the school, which is set in 
700 acres near Oxted, said yesterday that an allegation concerning Dr 
Triffitt was brought to its attention only in May 2011.

Educational authorities investigated 
and ruled last December after a professional conduct hearing that Dr 
Triffitt will never be allowed to teach again.

A panel of the Teaching 
Agency told in a report how he ‘engaged in an inappropriate relationship
 with a vulnerable student which exploited his position of trust’.

The girl – now thought to be studying 
at university – is said to have ‘confided and discussed a number of 
highly personal matters with Dr Triffitt’ and they soon began exchanging
 emails as they began an ‘increasingly co-dependent’ relationship.

The panel felt that the girl – named only as Student A – was a highly vulnerable and susceptible individual.

The £27,000-a-year Woldingham School is set in 700 acres and was founded in 1842

The hearing was told: ‘Dr Triffitt 
also kept a diary towards the end of their relationship to record his 
feelings towards the student – he would then give the diary to the 
student.

There were also occasions when they would meet alone.’

The panel said: ‘We have noted that the acts alleged, whilst unacceptable, have not been subject to criminal prosecution.

‘We have noted that during the 
relevant time he was under significant stress and he has presented 
evidence to show that he was the subject of psychiatric concerns – he 
admitted himself to hospital.

Whilst his previously unblemished career 
does act as mitigation for him, we are concerned that his extensive 
experience did not prevent him from engaging in such highly 
inappropriate behaviour.’

The report concluded: ‘Dr John 
Triffitt is prohibited from teaching indefinitely and cannot teach in 
any school, sixth form college, relevant youth accommodation or 
children’s home in England.

‘Furthermore, in view of the 
seriousness of the allegation found proved against him... Dr John 
Triffitt shall not be entitled to apply for restoration of his 
eligibility to teach.’

Mrs Triffitt, who was appointed to her
 post in 2007, declined to comment yesterday at the red-brick cottage in
 the Woldingham School grounds where she lives with her two children.

However the highly-rated school said 
in a statement: ‘In May 2011 an allegation was brought to the school’s 
attention concerning a member of staff at the school, Dr John Triffitt.

The day the  allegation was received, Dr Triffitt left the school and 
resigned from his post shortly afterwards.

The school adhered strictly 
to safeguarding procedures and immediately contacted the child 
protection authorities for them to investigate the matter.

During the 18
 months of the inquiry the school notified the relevant professional 
authorities and co-operated fully with investigations into the matter up
 to and including its conclusion.

‘On 4 December 2012, the Teaching 
Agency considered the matter and found Dr Triffitt guilty of 
unacceptable professional conduct and conduct that may bring the 
profession into disrepute.

The Teaching Agency recommended that Dr 
Triffitt be prohibited from teaching indefinitely. The Prohibition Order
 is published on their website.

As the Teaching Agency website makes 
clear the Prohibition Order was made without naming the school or the 
student involved.

‘This was done in order to protect the
 welfare of the girl concerned. A young person’s welfare could be 
impacted adversely by unnecessary speculation or further publication.’
