Ryanair is to offer customers £8 flights to the US - but passengers will still be hit with hidden costs along the way.

The
 airline intends to offer the cheap flights from between 12 to 14 
European cities to the same amount of destinations in America.

However, the transatlantic flights won’t be available for up to another five years when the company gets the long-haul aircraft it needs.

The flights are expected to be offered from between 12 to 14 European cities

Ticket:                                                     £8.21

Credit card fee:                                       £4.54

One checked bag 20kg:                         £25

Seat reservation:                                    £10

Airport passenger duty                           £67

Food:                                                     £30.95

(Panini, cup of tea, small Heineken, glass of wine, bottle of water, lasagne and chips)                                           

Grand total:                                         £145.70

Michael
 O’Leary, the airline’s chief executive, told the Irish Hotels 
Federation conference in Meath that Ryanair would offer the €10 (£8.21) 
flights to Boston and New York.

Flights back to Europe from the US would cost $10 (£6.00).

However, he admitted that passengers would pay extra for everything from meals to baggage.

He said: 'We can make money on 99 cent fares in Europe.

'Not every seat will be €10 of course; there will also need to be a very high number of business or premium seats.'

Last year he said: 'There is 15 per cent of the public who will pay for the frills and you will be mad to switch off from that'.

Mr
 O’Leary has previously said that 'a fleet of 30, 40, 50 aircraft and 
not two, four or six' would be required to get the operation up and 
running.

The airline's chief executive Michael O'Leary said 30 to 50 planes will be needed for the service

Ryanair has long been accused of luring customers in with low fares while charging sky-high fees for 'extras'.

Mr O'Leary has been the face of Ryanair for almost 20 years and has a reputation for being outspoken.

The 52-year-old promised to stop 'p*****g off' its customers after the company recorded a £28.7million loss in the last three months of 2013.
