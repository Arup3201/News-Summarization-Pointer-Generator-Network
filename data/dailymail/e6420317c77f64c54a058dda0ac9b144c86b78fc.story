A would-be multi-millionaire might lose their £12 million lottery prize if they do not claim the cash by Wednesday.

Ironically, the winning ticket was bought in Ladywood, Birmingham, one of the poorest areas in Britain.

The prize is set to become the second highest unclaimed lottery win after no one claimed a £64 million EuroMillions prize in December last year.

Would-be multi-millionaire: A £12 million lottery prize is yet to be claimed and if the winner does not come forward by Wednesday the money will be donated to charity

The ticket was bought on May 31 but now, six months on, the Wednesday 11pm deadline is looming for the winner.

A Camelot spokesman said they will be walking the Birmingham streets on Monday in a last chance bid to find the winner.

A spokesman said: ‘We have not had a valid claim for this prize.

‘But we have had big prizes claimed at the last minute.’

The winning raffle number is JRG437445. If it is not claimed by November 27 the money will go to charitable causes.

But perhaps it is a blessing in disguise. Recently couple Dave and Angela Dawes from Wisbech, Cambridgeshire decided to split up after their £101 million lottery win because they argued over how to spread the EuroMillions cash between their family and friends.

Blessing in disguise? The unclaimed prize comes as couple Dave and Angela Dawes decided to split because they argued about how best to spend their £101 million lottery win

The couple, who bought their winning 
ticket from a WHSmith store and got married in Gretna Green following 
the windfall in December 2011, went from living in a one bedroom flat to
a £9 million mansion in Surrey, as well as a flat in West London's 
Chelsea Harbour, so Mr Dawes, 49, can walk to the ground of his beloved 
Chelsea FC.

Last year’s unclaimed £64 million prize was donated to health, education and other charitable causes after National Lottery launched a desperate search for the winning ticket holder.

Michael Thompson, a spokesman for The National Lottery Good Causes, said at the time: 'Countless good causes will benefit from this unclaimed prize. 

'In theory, the £64 million unclaimed prize would fund over 6,000 minibuses to help kids with disabilities.

Other lottery wins that were never 
claimed include £9.4 million on a ticket bought in Doncaster in July 
2005, £7million in Belfast in 2004 and £6.9 million jackpot in Devon in 
2007.

In 2001 Martyn Tott, a purchasing manager from Watford, missed out on a jackpot of £3,011,065 after losing his ticket. Using computer records, he was able to prove the winning ticket was his but Camelot refused to pay out - since the rules state that the winner must have their ticket to claim their fortune. 

The decision sparked a national furore, with even the then Prime Minister Tony Blair championing Mr Tott’s cause - but all in vain.
