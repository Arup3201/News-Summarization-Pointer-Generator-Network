Sir Alex Ferguson former assistant Mike Phelan is under consideration to become Norwich’s next permanent manager after Neil Adams resigned yesterday.

Phelan has taken temporary charge of the club in the absence of Adams after formerly being first-team coach.

Chief executive David McNally is in the process of recruiting a permanent successor to Adams after his nine-month spell as manager.

Adams was handed the job in April after Norwich sacked Chris Hughton, but he was unable to keep them in the Barclays Premier League, losing five of their final six fixtures. 

Norwich are seventh in the Championship, three points behind Brentford in sixth, but with only three wins since October the club’s board decided to act.

Adams said: ‘I firmly believe we’re still on course for a crack at promotion back to the Premier League. That’s where this club belongs. However, I feel it is in the best interests of the team that an immediate change is made to ensure a positive impact on results.’

The 49-year-old will take a break from football but will return for a role at the club, as yet undetermined, in July.

Norwich are currently seventh in the Championship table, three points off the play-offs
