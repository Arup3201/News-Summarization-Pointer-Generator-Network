A housing estate has been built in the shape of a swastika in a British town twinned with Germany.

The council estate in Devizes, Wiltshire, is in the shape of the most hated symbol of the 20th century.

Tony Bolwell, who lives in the town, spotted the similarity with Hitler's symbol. 

Symbol: The estate in Waiblingen Way, Devizes, looks like the Nazi symbol

Hated: The swastika has become inextricably linked with Germany's Nazi Party

He told The Sun: 'I was looking at some aerial pictures and was gobsmacked by it.'

The small estate was built in the 1950s or 60s and is named after a small town near Stuttgart, Germany. 

Waiblingen Way has an average house price of about £220,000 and the strangely-shaped block is at the end of a cul-de-sac.

Wiltshire Council said it did not know who designed the homes. 

Devizes is also twinned with Mayenne, France, in a link that was set up in the 1960s. 

Nazis adopted the swastika and used the symbol of the German eagle standing on top of the swastika as the party logo.

The original symbol dates back hundreds of years and has been used in civilisations across the globe including Africa, Asia and Europe.

It was used as a good luck symbol and was in folklore as well as being the symbol for the Finnish Air Force.

Two years ago, a picture of a house in Swansea went viral after people spotted that it looked like Hitler's face.

Street level: The estate's similarity with the hated symbol can't be seen from ground level
