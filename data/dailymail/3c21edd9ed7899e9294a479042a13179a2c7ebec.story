The story of three black robbers who wore latex masks to dress as white cops when they knocked over a New York check-cashing store last year was so sensational it could have come from a movie script. Prosecutors revealed yesterday that it did.

Authorities in New York say Akeem Monsalvatge, Derrick Dunkley and Edward Byam took their ideas straight from the 2010 Ben Affleck film 'the Town,' which is about a gang of bank robbers who use clever disguises to cover their tracks.

The race-switching disguises for the Queens, New York, robbery were so good that store clerks had no idea that the robbers had been wearing masks at all, witnesses testified at the trial for the three men - which began on Tuesday.

The robbers got away with a $200,000 haul.

Bad inspiration: Prosecutors say Ben Affleck's 2010 film 'The Town' gave three accused robbers in New York their script for a $200,000 robbery of a check-cashing store

The New York Post reports that Brooklyn prosecutors have submitted into evidence a picture of Monsalvatge and one of his alleged co-conspirators wearing a t-shirt with a scene from the film.

The case bears other hallmarks from the movie, as well.

The robbers showed a clerk at the Pay-O-Matic cash-cashing store in Queens, New York, a picture of her house to prove that they were 'serious' - just has Affleck's character did in the opening bank robbery scene of 'The Town.'

They also doused the scene in bleach in an attempt to clean up any DNA evidence left at the scene - another trick taken from the film.

The men also are accused of dressing as cops, which Affleck and on-screen partner Jeremy Renner pulled off at the end of 'The Town' during a heist at Boston's Fenway Park.

There are, however, key differences between the film and the real-life heist.

In 'The Town,' Affleck and on-screen partner Jeremy Renner dressed as cops - just as the suspects in the Queens robbery

Each set of masks Affleck and his cohorts wore in the film were clearly meant to be disguises. In one scene they wore ghoulish Halloween masks. In another, they dressed as nuns.

The masks Monsalvatge and his cohorts used were much, much better.

They reportedly paid $2,000 for masks made by Custom Effects, a film special effect company that has recently done work for '2 Guns' and 'The Wolverine.'

‘We don’t 
know if they are white, black or Hispanic. People in the neighborhood 
saw them in the van for two or three days before the robbery,' a police spokesman said at the time. 'They saw 
three white guys.’

And the race-swapping angle is a totally new angle.

Customized: The customized mask model used in the heist costs well over $500

Stash: The two made away with $200,000 in pilfered funds

The alleged robbers are said to have taken great pains to hide the fact that they are black.

Thick gloves covered their skin 
completely, and dark glasses hid their eyes, making it nearly impossible to identify them.

After getting away with the heist, Byam wrote a short thank you note to Composite Effects, the makers of the mask, to show his gratitude for the 'realism' of the disguise.

The photograph of the clerk's home that the robbers left behind proved part of their undoing. The police then traced the photograph of
the clerk's home to a nearby Walgreen's where it had been developed. They were able to get Byam's 
home phone number on a receipt.

Thanks to an anonymous tip, the NYPD zeroed in on Composite Effects, a company that makes masks similar to the ones the criminals used.

They contacted the company which then supplied them with an email from Byam.

'I’m sending this message to say I’m extremely pleased by CFX work on the mask,' Byam allegedly wrote, according to the New York Post. 'The realism of the mask is unbelievable.'

It appears they purchased the 'Mac the Guy' model with customized hair designs for upwards of $600.

If the trio were wearing masks the stunt would imitate a London bank robbery, Britain’s biggest ever, when £40m was robbed from the exclusive Grafts in Mayfair.

The two crooks hired a professional make-up artist to disguise them using liquid latex, at a cost of £450 ($720), reportedly under the pretense that the four-hour transformation was for a pop video.
