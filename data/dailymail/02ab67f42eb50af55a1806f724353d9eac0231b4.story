 

A young man who went to his doctor seeking help for back pain says he was left feeling 'dirty and ashamed' by what happened next.

The patient says Kelvin Thuc Minh Vo asked him a series of highly inappropriate personal questions, including whether he watched pornography, liked 'rough sex', had an interest in Asian men and if he was a 'giver' or 'taker'.

The young man later said, it had left him 'scarred for life.'

Horrified: The patient had complained about the actions of Kelvin Thuc Minh Vo, who worked in Campbelltown

He is one of two men whose complaints sparked the Health Care Complaint Commission to de-register Mr Vo for two years for professional misconduct.

The commission said Mr Vo, 49, was running a solo practice at Campbelltown in south western Sydney when the young homosexual man, then around 18, went to him for help in 2009 and 2010.

In another incident, when the man went to Mr Vo for back pain, it was alleged the GP placed his hand around the young man's penis and propositioned him.

The young man, who can't be named for legal reasons, said he was left feeling 'dirty and ashamed he had done that to me'.

More than a year later, in 2011, Mr Vo then instigated oral sex on another male patient, then aged 27.

When the patient stopped him, the GP said: 'I'm prepared to give anything to you if you don't tell anyone.'

On Monday, the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal upheld the complaints made by both men, finding the conduct of Mr Vo was so serious his registration needed to be cancelled to maintain public confidence in doctors.

The tribunal said he, 'exploited a relationship of trust with his young and vulnerable patient'.

'We have found the practitioner to be untruthful, and can place no weight on his expressed remorse for his actions, other than his remorse for the consequences of those actions on him and his wife,' it said.

It ordered his registration be cancelled for at least two years.
