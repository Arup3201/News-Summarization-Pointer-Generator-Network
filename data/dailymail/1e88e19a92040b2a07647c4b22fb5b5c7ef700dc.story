The death of a Harvard Business School student who vanished on Sunday after drinking with friends in a bar has been ruled an accidental drowning.

Nathan Bihlmaier, 31, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, disappeared after leaving the Ri Ra Irish Pub in Portland, Maine, where he was celebrating his upcoming graduation with two friends.

His body was pulled out of a nearby harbor by divers on Tuesday afternoon after clothing that belonged to the 31-year-old was found the day before.

Last seen: He and two friends had visited the Old Port area before Mr Bihlmaier vanished around 1am, divers found a body there today

The state medical examiner ruled Mr Bihlmaier's death an accidental drowning on Wednesday.

Portland Police Chief Michael Sauschuck had earlier confirmed the identity of the body, saying: 'It’s a tragic end.'

He added: 'We had high hopes throughout working with the family and the community to bring Nate home. These weren’t the circumstances that we wanted to.'

Police said Mr Bihlmaier was separated from friends after being asked to leave the waterfront bar at 12:20am on Sunday because he was intoxicated. He later failed to return to his hotel.

His wife is pregnant with their first child. He was due to graduate on Thursday.

Police told the Portland Press Herald that Mr Bihlmaier and his two friends traveled to Portland for the weekend to celebrate their graduation from business school.

Police confirmed that he had 'a little bit too much to drink' when he was asked to leave, but added that he did not cause a disturbance while leaving the bar.

Concerned: Mr Bihlmaier's pregnant wife, Nancy Hi Bihlmaier, pictured with her husband at right, rushed to the coastal city after receiving the news of his death

'At that point he left the bar very cooperatively,' police chief Michael Sauschuck said, according to the Bangor Daily News. 'There were no altercations - he just left voluntarily after being spoken to by bar staff.'

He spoke to his friends on the phone, but never returned to the hotel where they were staying. They searched for him to no avail and reported him missing at 9am.

'He is a well-established individual from a strong family. He has a wife who is expecting their first child. There is no reason he would [purposely] go missing,' Lt Gary Hutcheson told the Press Herald.

Family: Mr Bihlmaier, originally from Kansas, with his wife Nancy and his parents Cheryl and Steve

According to his cell phone records, Mr Bihlmaier did not venture far.

Police tracked his movements through his phone signal after he left the bar until his battery apparently died 40 minutes later.

The Coast Guard and the Portland harbormaster worked together with police to launch the underwater hunt for clues.

They even used a cadaver dog on an inflatable raft to search for the man's scent.

His pregnant wife, Nancy Hi Bihlmaier, rushed to the coastal city after receiving the news that her husband was missing, as did around 20 of his business school friends.

A spokesman for the school told the Press Herald: 'His friends describe him as really one top-notch guy.'

Mr Bihlmaier, whose family comes from Kansas but who is now based in the Boston area, specializes in the business of healthcare, and is employed by medical provider Optum.

He has previously worked at several other healthcare firms, as well as for the Department of Health and Human Services.
