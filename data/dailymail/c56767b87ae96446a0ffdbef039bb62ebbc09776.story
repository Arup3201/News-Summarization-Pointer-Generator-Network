Imagine if you could find your perfect jeans without the endless trawl around denim stores trying on countless pairs.

We've all been there - wrestling on pair after pair of jeans in cramped, overheated changing rooms in an attempt to find the Holy Grail of denim - the pair that will do the impossible of slimming, lengthening and lifting.

Given that it's a Herculean task to ask of any item of clothing, it's no surprise that women try on an average of 15 pairs before settling on the perfect pair... Or giving up and going home.

The Bodymetric scanner takes readings from 300,000 points all over the body, creating an accurate map of the body's curves and contours

Well, luckily for us, the High Street is beginning to sit up and listen. From today, customers at the New Look store at Westfield Stratford will be able to avoid the traumas of ill-fitting jeans (goodbye, gaping waists, too-short legs and baggy bottoms) thanks to the installation of a Bodymetrics 3D body scanner.

Shoppers will strip to their underwear and step into the scanner, which is shaped like a photo booth.

Low-power, infra-red lights will read more than 300,000 points all over the body. The whole process will take no more than 7 seconds.

One hundred vital statistics can be gathered - from bottom, waist and hip measurements down to the size of the left ankle, thigh girth and inside leg.

The Bodymetrics pods have become smaller and more compact thanks to advances in technology, meaning more stores across the nation will be able to accommodate one in their changing rooms

Once the customer has been scanned, a dedicated denim Fit Stylist will analyse the curves and contours of the body-mapping, using the information to pick and pick out the perfect pair - and hey presto, the jean genie's work will be done.

The team will then email the customer their unique body map for future reference - based on the theory that as more stores implement the technology, the details could help with accurate fitting.

The technology is not new - it first launched 2001, and was tipped to be the next major development for fashion brands, with many vowing to install them in their changing rooms.

At the time the technology was 
launched, it was tipped to revolutionise the way we try on and buy 
clothes. Ten years on though, the pods have not made their way to 
fashion's front line in the way that was originally predicted.

Then, upmarket department store Selfridges installed a pod in their own denim room  - but until now, that is the only Bodymetrics pod that has been available for consumers, and it has never reached the masses on the High Street.

Behind the scenes, a handful of 
companies - New Look included - have been using the technology in-house 
to ensure uniformity of size for garments manufactured in factories 
across the globe.

Now though, Bodymetrics' CEO Suran Goonatilake says major advances in technology mean that vision could soon become reality.

'There's been a big leap in technology - new body scanners are smaller, cheaper and faster. 

'Fashion is one of the few industries where no sizing standards exist. Size labels vary from retailer to retailer and from brand to brand, and one person can be as much as three different size labels in three different brands - for example, ranging between 8 and 12, because of the discrepancy.

'Soon, as more retailers take up the technology, Bodymetrics will allow you to discover what size you are in different brands.

Furthermore, Goonatilake believes the body scanners could transform internet shopping.

'One of the key barriers in internet shopping is that because you can't try items on, returns are between 20 and 40 per cent of all garments sold,' he says.

'It's a real inconvenience for the consumer, and hits the bottom line of the retailer. 

'It's not good for the environment in terms of transporting garments back and forth either.

'Our vision is that over the next few years, most retailers will have body scanners which will allow people to shop in store as well as online and help find clothes that fit perfectly their size, shape and style.

'Once you have your body scanned, it will be uploaded to your Bodymetrics account which can be accessed online, so you can shop for clothes knowing they're going to fit.

Bodymetrics 3D body scanner will be in store at New Look Westfield from today until 1 November.
