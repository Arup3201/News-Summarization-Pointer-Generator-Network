Designer duo Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen have revealed that they faced a huge amount of criticism from fashion insiders at the start of their careers, many of whom viewed them as nothing more than former actresses who were dabbling in the profession for fun.

During and interview with ELLE magazine, the 28-year-old twins, who are busy celebrating the tenth anniversary of their globally-successful label The Row, admitted that, despite their incredible success as designers, their initial transition from film to fashion was not without its difficulties. 

'People were asking us all sorts of questions in the beginning,' Mary-Kate, who is the younger of the pair by just two minutes, said.

'It went beyond skeptical,' added Ashley. '[But] you just have to put on blinders and do your work.'

Despite any initial doubt they faced from fashion's elite at the start of their careers, the pair have long since proven their abilities both as designers and as businesswomen, and have happily left their once-successful acting careers behind them.

The twins, who first rose to fame in 1987 at the age of six months when they shared the role of young Michelle Tanner in hit sitcom Full House, were named as the CFDA's Accessories Designer of the Year in June, having scooped the title of CFDA Womenswear Designer of the Year in 2012.

Luxury label The Row is now carried in 145 of the most exclusive boutiques and department stores in the US, including Barneys, Bergdorf's, Neiman Marcus, and Saks. Further afield, the brand can be found on the shelves of stores such as Selfridges in London and Le Printemps in Paris. 

What began with a mission to create the perfect white T-shirt, the first item to go on sale under the label's name, is now a global fashion sensation, with the brand turning over tens of millions of dollars in sales each year.

But the Olsen sisters are aware that The Row's high price points - one of the brand's most well-known products is an alligator-skin backpack which retails for $34,000 - don't appeal to everyone.

Happily married? Rumors are circulating that Mary-Kate has married her boyfriend of three years Olivier Sarkozy after she was spotted wearing what appeared to be a gold wedding band during a basketball game last week (pictured) 

Enter Elizabeth and James, the designers' second, lower-priced, fashion line, which caters for a younger consumer. 

The label was inspired by their older brother James, 30, who goes by his middle name Trent, and younger sister Elizabeth, 25, who is currently carving out a career for herself as a successful film actress. 

While it operates on a slightly smaller scale than its sister line The Row, it too has expanded beyond the girls' initial expectations and recently spawned its own signature scents, Elizabeth and James Nirvana Black and Nirvana White. 

The twins continue to oversee every detail of the day-to-day running of each label, including the venues for their fashion shows, the locations of their stores and the design of every product. 

'Every move that we've made through the past ten years has been step-by-step... ' Ashley explained.

'...I think we do things because we stare at them for too long.'

'One item at a time,' Mary-Kate added. 'We sit and look at everything in every possible version of how you might wear it. We are all about making our clothes work with reality.'

But while the girls are happy to share their design philosophies, when it comes to their personal lives, they are incredibly guarded, preferring to keep everything as private as possible - particularly their relationships. 

Indeed, in recent weeks rumors have been circulating that Mary-Kate has secretly married French banker Olivier Sarkozy, her boyfriend of three years. The designer has been spotted wearing a gold band on her wedding finger on a number of occasions, most recently while the loved-up pair were enjoying a basketball game in New York earlier this month. 

But while speculation continues to surround the couple, Mary-Kate has thus far refused to offer an explanation, preferring instead to remain silent on any and all issues not relating to her role in the sisters' businesses, including recent reports that she has undergone plastic surgery.
