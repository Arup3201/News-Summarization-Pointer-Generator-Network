The views from the white cliffs of the Sussex coast have remained unchanged for millions of years.

But visitors to the South Downs, drawn there for the unbroken vista of rolling hills and choppy seas, could soon be faced with the sight of scores of wind turbines towering above the waves.

Energy Secretary Ed Davey has approved a £2billion project to build 175 turbines nine miles out to sea, each standing nearly 700 feet tall.

Opponents, including the National Trust and the South Downs National Park, say the view from landmarks such as Beachy Head (above) and the Seven Sisters cliffs will be spoiled for ever

He insists the Rampion wind farm, set for completion in 2018, is essential because it will power 450,000 homes with green energy.

Mr Davey, a Liberal Democrat, said: ‘This project is great news for Sussex, providing green jobs as well as driving business opportunities right across the country in a sector with a clear roadmap for long-term growth.’

But opponents, including the National Trust and the South Downs National Park, say the view from landmarks such as Beachy Head and the Seven Sisters cliffs, and towns including Brighton and Eastbourne, will be spoiled for ever.

Depending on the terms of the contract that German developer E.on signs with the Government, it can be expected to receive up to £200million a year in subsidies, critics say.

The National Trust, which owns sections of the Sussex coast, has formally objected to the project.

In a letter to the Government’s planning inspectorate, the Trust said: ‘The beauty of the coastline matters to the nation.

‘The impact of the proposal on the designated assets of the National Park and heritage coast, on the landscape and seascape character of the area, on important visual receptors and on key National Trust sites is considered to be major.’

The decision was handled by Mr Davey and his energy department because it is considered a major infrastructure project, providing a large chunk of the nation’s electricity needs.

Ed Davey and his Liberal Democrat colleagues are strong advocates of wind power, despite common objections from people who live near planned sites

Mr Davey and his Liberal Democrat colleagues are strong advocates of wind power, despite common objections from people who live near planned sites.

The same cannot be said of certain members of his Coalition partners.

A report published by the Campaign to Protect Rural England today reveals that Eric Pickles, the Conservative Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, has single-handedly slashed the number of on-shore wind farms and large solar arrays given planning permission in the last year.

A year ago Mr Pickles announced he would personally oversee all wind and solar planning appeal cases.

Since then the number of planning approvals for solar and wind farms has fallen from 80 per cent to 60 per cent.

Mr Davey and Mr Pickles are known to disagree on their approach to renewable energy and the planning system - but at the moment each are confined by their own remit.

The Energy Secretary has influence when a project is deemed to be a national infrastructure matter, while Mr Pickles can only intervene if an application is taken to appeal.

In 2013, Eric Pickles announced he would personally oversee all wind and solar planning appeal cases.

Nick Clack, senior energy campaigner at CPRE, said: ‘We applaud the Government for taking action to stop renewable energy projects that would have a damaging effect on the countryside.

‘But without a clearer and more strategic approach to planning in the first place, we’re relying on one minister to intervene and protect our landscapes.

‘Planning policy must be further clarified to make sure that the need for renewable energy does not automatically override environmental protection and the wishes of local communities.

‘The current approach to planning renewable projects, that are needed to produce low-carbon energy, is chaotic and unsustainable.

‘With the pressure for renewable energy in the countryside only set to increase, we need to see further improvements in planning policy and incentives for brownfield and commercial sites.’
