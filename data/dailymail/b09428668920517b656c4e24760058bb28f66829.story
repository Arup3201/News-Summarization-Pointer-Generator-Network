Brave: Lance Corporal Jonathan James McKinlay

A British soldier was shot dead by insurgents as he helped Afghan police officers find a place to pray, an inquest heard.

Lance Corporal Jonathan McKinlay, 33, was shot through the neck while on patrol with the 1st Battalion The Rifles in Helmand in September last year.

Members of his family attending the inquest in Chester-le-Street, County Durham, heard how the Darlington-born soldier’s injuries were 'non-survivable', despite the efforts of comrades who tried to reach him while under heavy fire from the enemy.

L Cpl McKinlay was one of 12 British servicemen accompanied by three Afghan National Police and an interpreter who were on patrol from Checkpoint Chaabak in the Narh-e-Saraj area.

The group were around 90 minutes into the patrol and had stopped in a garden having changed route to avoid a potential ambush point ahead.Navy Medic Stuart Freeman, who was attached to The Rifles at the time, said L/Cpl McKinlay was in a field with the Afghan police, who had decided to pray.

He told coroner Andrew Tweddle: 'I believe he had his compass out.'

He agreed with the coroner when asked: 'Was he trying to help them find out which way to point (to pray)?'

Moments later the group came under heavy fire from two points.

Serjeant Christopher Wainwright said: 'We came under a heavy and sustained period of fire.

'I crawled forward into a ditch about 1m in front of me. I dropped into the ditch.'

The soldier was comforted by his dead comrade’s mother Valerie as he fought his emotions while giving evidence.

He continued: 'Facing away from the contact, I had a quick scan around to check all the guys were in cover.'

Satisfied the men behind him were all right, he turned and saw L/Cpl McKinlay lying out of a ditch.

As the firing raged from both sides, it was not possible to reach him for around six to seven minutes.

By the time Leading Medical Assistant Freeman could reach him, there was no sign of life.

Pathologist Dr Russell Delaney found later that he died from a “non-survivable” gunshot wound to the neck, which would have rendered him almost instantly unconscious.

Mr Tweddle read from the pathologist’s report that: 'It follows that there was nothing his colleagues or combat mates could have done to save his life.'

The Afghan interpreter was also shot and injured in the fire fight, though his injuries were not so severe.

When the coroner asked the family if they wanted to add anything to the inquest, L/Cpl McKinlay’s mother thanked his comrades for their efforts to reach him while coming under fire.

Mr Tweddle concluded the inquest by recording the verdict that 'L/Cpl McKinlay was shot by insurgents while on active military service in Afghanistan'.

L/Cpl McKinlay, who joined the Army in 1996, was deployed to Afghanistan in June 2011.

The father-of-three had also served in Northern Ireland and Iraq.

He left behind his wife Lisa, sister Becca, daughter Megan and stepchildren Ollie and Piper.
