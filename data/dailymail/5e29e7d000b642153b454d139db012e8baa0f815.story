UFC have announced the blockbuster line-up for their Memorial Day fight night in Las Vegas.

There are sure to be fireworks at UFC 187 on May 23 at the MGM Grand Hotel with a pair of world titles on the line.

Jon Jones, the promotion's pound-for-pound No 1 fighter, has won 12 fights including eight world light-heavweight title defences in a row and will face 30-year-old Anthony Johnson. 

Here is the line-up for the UFC 187 showpiece in Las Vegas in May, with Jon Jones the headliner

Jones will have to be careful as Johnson is unbeaten since 2012 and most recently stopped Alexander Gustafsson with a first-round TKO in January.

Chris Weidman will defend his world middleweight belt In the co-main event and will aim to remain undefeated against veteran fighter Vitor Belfort, who has strolled to three consecutive wins since defeat by Jones in 2012.

In addition, Khabib Nurmagomedov and Donald Cerrone will contest in a potential lightweight title eliminator with the Las Vegas showpiece set for some classic UFC action.

Jones failed a routine test on December 4, exactly a month before he made an eighth successful defence of his light-heavyweight title against Daniel Cormier.

The results of the test were released three days after his victory before Jones checked himself into rehab and was later fined £16,520 by the UFC.

The 27-year-old was remorseful for his actions: 'I'm not here to make excuses for what happened,' Jones told Fox Sports.

'A coward would sit here and try to come up with an elaborate reason or try to blame something. I'm not going to blame my friends or pressure,’ added Jones. 'I did it at a party; I messed up. It wasn't a mistake because I consciously did it.'
