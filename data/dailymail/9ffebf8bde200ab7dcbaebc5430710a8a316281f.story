A family have been reunited with their long-lost grandfather who disappeared more than 50 years ago after they found him living in Italy by tracking him down on Facebook.

Italian-born Vincenzo Mirarchi came to England as a teenager in the 1940s before he met and married Hazell Sidwell in 1955.

The couple had a son, John, but Mr Mirarchi was forced to return to Italy to help his parents before the birth of his second son, Christopher, in 1958.

He lost touch with his wife and they eventually divorced, both going on to marry other people.

Mr Mirarchi wrote to his sons but they never received the letters because his ex-wife's new husband intercepted them, leading them to believe that he wanted nothing to do with the family.

In 1977 Mr Mirarchi returned to Coventry to find his sons, but was unable to track them down after they moved to a different part of the city.

Two years ago Christopher's daughter Sian Morgan began researching her family tree and managed to trace her grandfather after finding his relatives on Facebook.

And last month the family met for the first time after they travelled to Italy for an emotional reunion.

'It has been an amazing journey for all of us,' said 25-year-old Miss Morgan, who lives in Coventry.

'My dad never knew his father Vincenzo because he left England before he was born.

'It took 18 months to finally track him down and contact him. We didn’t know what his reaction would be but we were bowled over by the welcome we had from him.

'He was so happy to see us because, as he said, he feared he had lost us forever.'

Miss Morgan, a hairdresser, began searching for her grandfather after hearing the story of him being forced to leave his wife and children to return to his homeland.

She said: 'When I started the search, I only had his name, when he was in England, the date he married my grandmother and his date of birth from the marriage certificate. We didn’t even know if he was still alive.

'I went onto Facebook, because I thought ‘you never know’, and searched for his name but there were a lot of Mirarchis.

'I contacted a few of them, but a lot didn’t want to know, or didn’t speak English.'

Bizarrely, she finally found her grandfather, who worked as a miner and farm worker in Italy, after accidentally stumbling on a long-lost cousin with the same surname.

Mother-of-one Miss Morgan added: 'The search was salvaged by a stranger called Vitaliano Mirarchi, who wanted to help even though at first he didn’t think he was connected to my grandfather.

'He had a friend in the registry office who was able to track his address down at another office and we found out he was alive and his address in Induno Olona, Varese, near Milan.

Marriage: Italian-born Mr Mirarchi came to England as a teenager in the 1940s before he met and married Hazell Sidwell in 1955

'The strangest thing happened when he actually discovered he was a second cousin of my grandfather.

'I got an address for my grandfather and I wrote to him telling him who I was and saying we were here if he wanted to talk to us.

'He was so pleased when he got the letter he cried when he opened it. It was lovely. He said he had never stopped looking for us and invited us to meet him.'

Emotional: Mr Morgan meeting his father Mr Mirarchi for the first time at Milan airport

Miss Morgan travelled with her father, 55, a project manager for a flooring company, and his 59-year-old brother John, a builder, to meet Mr Mirarchi over Easter.

'We flew out on Good Friday and stayed for five nights and the whole thing was just wonderful,' she said.

'My dad was so emotional, and he looks the spitting image of his father, it was amazing.

'He used to write letters to his wife and children from Italy all the time, but my step-grandfather wasn't a nice man and used to rip up those letters before my gran read them.

Dream: Miss Morgan, pictured right with daughter Minnie, said meeting her extended family was a 'dream come true'

Great uncle: Mr Morgan's half brother Givseppe with baby Minnie

'As a result they never knew he had always tried to stay in touch with them.

'The whole thing is an absolute dream, it really is all my dreams come true.'

Mr Morgan added: 'I don't remember him at all and when I was six and my brother was nine our mum had remarried and we changed our name.

'I think dad sent us letters but we never got them.

'It was very strange to think we would meet him and I felt very nervous about it.

'My mum and step-dad are dead now so meeting dad answered many questions I had.'
