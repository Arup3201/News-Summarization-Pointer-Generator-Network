A former French intelligence officer who defected to Al Qaeda in Iraq was one of the targets of US air strikes last month, it has been revealed. 

The unnamed man, said to be one of the highest ranking Western officials to join the terror group, is believed to have survived the attack, which hit eight different locations occupied by the Nursa Front.

His identity has been kept a secret with some saying his defection was one of the most dangerous developments in the on-going battle with the militant organization.

Defection: The French intelligence officer is said to have been one of the targets of airstrikes last month that hit positions occupied by the Nursa Front in  Iraq and Syria. The official has not been identified 

According to McClatchy DC he is a former explosives expert with an Arab family and his movements are being closely watched by Western authorities. 

One European official told the site that they had tried to take the defected official out with a strike rather than capture him because of the desire to keep his existence a secret. 

The aerial bombardments by the US and its allies focused on the Khorosan group, a unit said to be planning an imminent attack on the West, but Islamic State positions were also hit.

The only member of the Khorosan group who has been named and identified as a target in the strikes is Mushin Al Fadhl who was killed.

He was named as the leader of the Al Qaeda-affiliated cell - a radical terror collective specializing in intercepting Western jihadists on their arrival in Syria, and training them to carry out deadly bomb attacks on targets in their home nations.

Two intelligence sources told McClatchy that the defected official had either left the French military intelligence or France's foreign intelligence agency, the General Directorate for External Security, (DGSE).

He is also believed to have fought in Afghanistan and in Syria with Al Qaeda where he is said to have assembled a group of about five men that was operating out of a mosque in Idlib.

The French operative is believed to be 'still alive and kicking' after the airstrikes, said one European intelligence official, who described him as 'highly trained in Western intelligence trade-craft and explosives.'

They added that they are unsure whether he was a 'sleeper' agent or was radicalized during his time in the service. However they said it was an embarrassing situation for the French. 

'It sounds likely he started as French military and maybe because of an Arabic family background and appearance, language skills and a high degree of competency, he would then be loaned out to different aspects of the French services,' one European official told the site.

Another said the situation represents an 'epic nightmare that we have so far been spared'.  

Aerial: The multiple waves of strikes have hit many high profile targets including the Jeribe Oil Refinery in Syria 

Attack: The aerial bombardments by the US and its allies focused mainly on the Khorosan group, a unit said to be planning an imminent attack on the West, but Islamic State positions were also hit

Arsenal: The initial wave of strikes on a number of locations was said to have included 47 cruise missiles 

F/A-18E Super Hornets were recently pictured in action as part of the US strikes to degrade and destroy the extremist terrorist group ISIS and their affiliates 

The F18s were launched from the aircraft carrier USS George H.W. Bush, which is positioned in the Persian Gulf. 

They were taken this weekend as the US unleashed a wave of fresh attacks in Syria and Iraq, destroying ISIS tanks, armoured vehicles and mortar teams. 

The destruction of IS targets in Syria and Iraq aims to limit the terrorist's group ability to lead, control and conduct operations.

Bahrain, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates have joined the US in participating in the airstrikes against ISIS.

Although the RAF has started bombing targets in Iraq, the Prime Minister has ruled out sending ground troops.

The US launched air strikes in Iraq in August and Syria, in September. 

IS has declared a so-called caliphate in the areas it has taken, and is also holding a number of hostages.

Although currently limited to Iraq and Syria, IS has promised to 'break the borders' of Jordan and Lebanon and to 'free Palestine'.
