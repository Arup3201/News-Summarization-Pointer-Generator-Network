No self-respecting fashionista would be seen without perfectly pedicured nails, but most would probably think twice about giving their cat colourful claws to match.

Yet one particular devoted follower of fashion decided to do just this - before realising the newly adopted addition to her family was making her break out in a rash.

Which means Broccoli the cat is now back at the shelter looking for a new owner - complete with her very own 'peticure'.

Tickled pink: Broccoli was given colourful claws by her owner, who then discovered she was allergic to cats

It is understood Broccoli had been particularly chosen by the young woman because she thought her black coat would make her the perfect addition to her chic home in Geneva, Switzerland.

However, it appears she also felt the poor animal could do with a flash of colour.

And no one would have been any the wiser, if the woman hadn't broken out in a rash and begun sneezing - caused by a hitherto unknown allergy to cats.

Valerie Derivaz, the head of the SOS-Chats animal home in Geneva, said: 'This time Brocoli returned with bright pink claws which were certainly not there when she left the home. 

'We found out they are actually something called soft claws that look just like the acrylic nails you would get during a manicure.'

It transpires the woman - who had agreed to take Broccoli in for a temporary period until a more permanent home could be found - had fitted the cat with special soft claws.

Trend: The cat was then returned to the shelter - who were surprised to see Broccoli's pink nails

They are designed to stop cats from scratching furniture, wooden floors or humans, and last for four to six weeks before dropping off naturally. 

But, Ms Derivaz explained, they are not seen  as a viable alternative to simply keeping a cat's claws neat and tidy.

She said: 'These nails actually really restrict cats. They need claws to be able to take care of themselves, to climb and to cling on after a jump

Vet Rodolphe Spycher also believes they are not a good idea. 

'There are yet more alternatives like getting a scratching post for your cat so they pay more attention to that than your leather sofa,' he pointed out. 

Concerns: The shelter's director is worried these 'soft claws' will inhibit the cats ability to exercise

But it seems Broccoli is not the first, or last, cat to get their very own petitcure. 

Ms Derivaz said: 'Just after Brocoli was returned to the home, I saw another cat on the the street with brightly coloured plastic nails.

'I really hope this isn't some kind of trend.'

However, Peter To - the director of UK company Soft Claws - says they are not fashion accessories.

'Soft claws are designed only for indoor cats, where it does not inhibit their ability to exercise,' he said.

'It is not a fashion accessory: the colours are a bit of a novelty, but the main consumers are people who need to find a solution other than re-homing them.'
