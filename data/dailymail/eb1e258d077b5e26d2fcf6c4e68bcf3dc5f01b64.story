Detectives have launched an investigation into alleged child abuse at a school set up by a friend of the late paedophile MP Cyril Smith.

Former pupils at Underley Hall, a boarding school opened by John Turner in Cumbria in 1976, claim that boys were physically assaulted by staff and sexually abused by a fellow pupil.

Mr Turner, a former headmaster at the notorious Knowl View School in Rochdale where Smith targeted vulnerable young boys, is accused of beating a pupil who complained about being indecently touched by the politician.

Paedophile MP Cyril Smith was a friend of John Turner who set up Underley Hall, a boarding school in Cumbria, in 1976

On at least one occasion Smith visited Underley Hall – a private boarding school for 'troubled' boys – as Mr Turner's guest, according to a former pupil.

There is even a suggestion that the disgraced MP had opened the school.

Outdoor pursuits teacher John Wadlow was charged in 1997 with sexual offences against children at Underley Hall but killed himself while awaiting trial.

But former pupils have told the Daily Mail they made much broader complaints of abuse to police at the time – including violent beatings by staff – only to find them brushed under the carpet.

One former pupil, now in his 50s, said the Liberal MP sexually assaulted him in the Knowl View staffroom in 1971.

But when word got back to Mr Turner, he allegedly thrashed the boy and accused him of dragging the politician's name through the mud.

The Lib Dem politician, who died aged 82 in 2010, is alleged to have used his status to sexually abuse scores of young boys with impunity at Knowl View School in Rochdale

The man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said: 'John Turner was very good friends with Cyril Smith.

'When I told them about Cyril Smith [abusing me], I was spanked by John Turner. He said I was trying to ruin a man's career. He punished me for it.'

Joseph Ryan, 44, from Manchester, who claims he was repeatedly sexually assaulted by an older boy and beaten when he was at Underley Hall in the early 1980s, said: 'We want justice. We want a proper inquiry. We want answers to the questions that should have been answered years ago.'

Mr Turner left Underley Hall in 1985. He retired to Scotland, where he died in 1996 aged 64. The school was closed in 2012 after a damning Ofsted report.
