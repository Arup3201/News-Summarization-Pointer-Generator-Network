Victims: Postmistress Fiona and her husband, Paul,  were forced to live off mouldy bread after Diane Lathlean helped herself to the profits

A couple running a village shop and post office were shocked to find their takings dramatically increased when one of their employees went off on a world cruise.

And on her return the couple’s profits plummeted – by so much that postmistress Fiona Senior, 48, had to give up taking a salary out of the business and feed her family mouldy bread.

Mrs Senior’s husband Paul, 45, became suspicious of shop assistant Diane Lathlean and watched hours of CCTV footage from inside the shop.

He discovered that the shop worker – who his wife counted as one of her best friends – had been betraying them by pilfering stock for years, a court heard yesterday.

The couple believe mother-of-three Lathlean, 50, stole stock and cash over a period of four years before she was caught. 

They believe her thefts amount to £50,000.

While they struggled, she was able to afford to go on a string of round-the-world cruises, including trips to Hawaii, the Bahamas and California.

After being confronted by Mr Senior, Lathlean quit her job, and later dropped a note through the door offering to repay more than £3,000 for missing stock from the shop in Ampleforth, North Yorkshire.

She denied stealing £3,050 of goods but was convicted by Scarborough Magistrates on Tuesday.

She now faces jail after being sent to York Crown Court to be sentenced. 

Chairman of the bench Carl Harwood told her: ‘The offence is so serious you need greater punishment than we can give you.’

Mr Senior told the court he had long suspected his employee was stealing, adding: ‘It stuck out a lot more when Diane was on holiday. We could afford to pay our bills when she was on holiday.

‘I suspected after a while there was something wrong. But because Diane was Fiona’s best friend she just would not hear of it.’

Lathlean, a part-time shelf-stacker and counter assistant, earned around £90 a week in wages.

Yet she enjoyed regular cruises and was a Tottenham Hotspur season ticket holder, travelling all over the country staying in hotels, her victims said.

Mr Senior told the court the ‘appalling’ takings suddenly flourished during Lathlean’s three-week voyage to Panama. 

‘We didn’t have to put money into the business for three weeks but when Diane returned we were back to square one,’ he said.

The couple ‘inherited’ Lathlean when they took over the post office and shop in 2008. 

She knew most of the people in the village and had served them for more than 20 years.

When Mr Senior checked the footage he spotted Lathlean slipping groceries into her bag or dropping them into a drawer to retrieve later.

He said: ‘I was in shock, deep shock, at the whole scenario.’

 A court heard the owners struggled to keep Post Office afloat while Lathlean splashed out on luxury holidays

Lathlean, of Ampleforth, told police she enjoyed regular holidays because her husband Simon had a well-paid job with American Express.

Outside court Mr Senior said: ‘We put £43,000 into the business while we lived like paupers and she was cruising the world.’

Mother-of-two Mrs Senior said: ‘We were eating mouldy bread and buying second-hand Christmas presents... I was devastated when I found out what Diane had been doing. 

'She was my best friend... Now I don’t even want to be in the same room as her.

The Seniors received a £28,000 settlement for alleged theft of money and goods by Lathlean in a civil case prior to her trial. 

For legal reasons it was not disclosed to magistrates.
