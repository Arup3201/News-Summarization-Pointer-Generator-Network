John Terry came off the bench to score as Chelsea got their pre-season schedule off to a winning start over Wycombe.

The Chelsea skipper slotted home his side's third of the night as the Blues - who were without their two big summer signings Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas - cruised to a comfortable 5-0 win.

Jose Mourinho started with a youthful side, the likes of Nathan Ake, Andreas Christiansen, Patrick Bamford and Nathaniel Chalobah all included in Wycombe forward Matt Bloomfield's testimonial.

Touch of class: Bamford provides the finish for his goal and Chelsea's opener

As you'd expect the encounter, Chelsea's first of pre-season, got off to a lethargic start.

Marco van Ginkel, who is now fully fit following last season's anterior cruciate ligament injury looked impressive in central midfield alongside Oriol Romeu during the opening exchanges.

The first real opening arrived in the 20th minute and it lead to Chelsea taking the lead when Ake's strong run and cross down the left resulted in Bamford sweeping home from 12 yards.

Todd Kane's night came to an end just a minute after the goal as he hobbled off with a groin injury to be replaced by Kurt Zouma - the 19-year-old defender signed from St Etienne for £12million in January.

And the France Under 21, who slotted in at right-back, looked comfortable on his first appearance as a Chelsea player.

But the visitors were lucky not find themselves level at half-time when Mark Schwarzer made a hash of dealing with Bloomfield's corner to leave Aaron Pierre with a free strike on goal, but the Australian's blushes were spared as the Wycombe man's effort was cleared off the line.

Mourinho made a raft of changes at half time; senior players Terry, Nemanja Matic, Branislav Ivanovic and Mohamed Salah all coming on.

But it was the Chelsea's young guns who combined again to give the west Londoners a two goal advantage three minutes after the restart.

Matic found Jay De Silva down the left  and the youngster located Izzy Brown who slotted past Matt Ingram from close range to double the lead.

Three minutes later Chelsea were further goals ahead, this time skipper Terry taking advantage of some slack Wycombe marking to slot home Jeremie Boga's corner.

Ivanovic somehow blasted over the bar from six yards in the 63rd minute after Matic's pass following more woeful Wycombe defending.

But the Serb made up for his miss three minutes later, rising above every one to nod the impressive Boga's free-kick past Ingram to put Chelsea four ahead, before Brown curled home the goal of the night three minutes from time.
