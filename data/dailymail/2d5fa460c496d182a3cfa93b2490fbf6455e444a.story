Luis Suarez has admitted he is just delighted to be back on the training ground after linking up with his Barcelona team-mates for the first time on Friday.

The Uruguayan had to train alone while waiting for the verdict of his appeal over the ban handed to him for biting Giorgini Chiellini at the World Cup. 

While upholding the four-month domestic and nine-match international ban, the Court for Arbitration in Sport did however relax the punishment slightly, with the 27-year-old now free to train with the rest of the Barcelona squad and participate in friendlies before his ban ends in late October.

'I am very grateful to the club for everything they have done for me in these last few weeks. They have treated me so well and I’m grateful now to be able to start this great challenge to play for Barça.
