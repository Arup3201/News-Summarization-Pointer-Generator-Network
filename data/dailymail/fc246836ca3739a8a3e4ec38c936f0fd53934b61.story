Paul Crouch, who built what has been called the world's largest Christian broadcasting network, has died. He was 79.

Trinity Broadcasting Network reported Saturday that Crouch died after a decade-long fight with degenerative heart disease.

A message was left for Crouch's grandson Brandon, who wrote about Crouch's death on his Twitter page.

Crouch and his wife Jan founded the 
network in 1973 and grew it into an international Christian empire that 
beams prosperity gospel programming to every continent but Antarctica 
around the clock.

The programming promises that if the faithful sacrifice for their belief, God will reward them with material wealth. 

Based
 in Costa Mesa, the network says it has 84 satellite channels and more 
than 18,000 television and cable affiliates as well as a Christian 
amusement park in Orlando.

Last year in March two former employees sued 
the non-profit of spending $50 million of its funding on 
extravagant personal expenses.

Among
 purchases, the Crouch couple were accused of misappropriating its 'charitable assets' toward a $50 
million jet, 13 mansions and a $100,000-mobile home for Mrs Crouch's 
dogs.

Their
 granddaughter, Brittany Koper, 26, recently filed her allegations in 
court after a brief appointment as the network's chief finance director 
in July.

The lawsuit attention came at a bad time for TBN, which had seen viewer donations drop steeply.

TBN
 raked in $92 million in donations in 2010 and cleared $175 million in 
tax-free revenue, but its net income plummeted from nearly $60 million 
in 2006 to a loss of $18 million in 2010, the most recent year 
available.

Donations fell by nearly $30 million in the same period â€” a 
hit the network blames on the bad economy.

TBN is no stranger to outside scrutiny.

In
 1998, the elder Crouch secretly paid an accuser $425,000 to keep quiet 
about allegations of a homosexual encounter.

Crouch Sr. has consistently
 denied the allegations, which were first reported by the Los Angeles 
Times, and has said he settled only to avoid a costly and embarrassing 
trial.

In 2000, after a
 five-year battle, a federal appeals court overturned a ruling by the 
FCC that found Mr Crouch had created a 'sham' minority company to get 
around limits on the number of TV stations he could own.
