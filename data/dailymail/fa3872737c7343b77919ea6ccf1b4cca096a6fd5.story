Assault: Police say Monty Turner, 51, attacked his wife with a Taser and pepper spray and kidnapped his son

A three-year-old Colorado boy has been found safe 900 miles from home after his estranged father allegedly assaulted his mother with pepper spray and a stun gun and kidnapped him.

Police in the small town of Brandon in Manitoba, Canada, rescued Luke Turner Sunday afternoon at a roadside motel. Officials say Monty Turner, fled the country with the boy after taking him from his mother's home in Longmont, Colorado, on Saturday morning.

The kidnapping led to an Amber Alert this weekend that spanned several states. The case became more complicated on Sunday morning when Monty Turner's father was arrested in his son's car on an expressway in southwest Missouri. 

This was the second time Monty Turner allegedly kidnapped his son from his wife in less than 12 months. He took Luke for five months in July 2012. The child was only returned to his mother in March.

Authorities say Turner hid in his wife's garage in Longmont, Colorado, and attacked her about 10am Saturday when she stepped outside to smoke a cigarette. 

He forced his way into the house after she fled inside and tried to call 911, according to court documents.

Missing: Luke Turner's abduction led to an Amber Alert and police searches in Colorado and Missouri - where authorities believed Monty planned to go

Attacked: Brandy Turner was only just reunited with little Luke in March after his father abducted him for five months. She said she tried to fight off her estranged husband, but he overpowered her

Brandy Turner said her son cried 'Don't hurt my mommy!' as he watched his father shock her with a Taser and then blasted her in the face with pepper spray, according to the Longmont Times-Call.

Turner told reports that she fought her husband, whom she is in the process of divorcing, but that the weapons allowed him to overpower her.

Monty Turner, 51, took the couple's son as he ate breakfast at the kitchen table.

Safe: Luke Turner was not harmed and will be returned to his mother this week

A judge had issued a permanent protection order barring Monty Turner from being within 100 feet of his wife or his son after he kidnapped the boy for five months last July.

Police later found him hiding out with the boy in a cabin 100 miles from Longmont and returned the young child to his mother in March. Because Monty had legal custody of Luke at the time, he was never arrested. However, a judge later stripped Monty of custody. 

Brandy Turner said her estranged husband demanded to see his son again when he confronted her on Saturday. He became violent when she wouldn't allow it.

Police searched for Monty Turner and little Luke after the kidnapping, but were unable to locate the car the father escaped in.

When they contacted Turner's brother, the reluctantly told authorities that Turner had been living in Denver with his father, Ronald Turner, and that the two planned to flee to Springfield, Missouri - some 800 miles away from Longmont, according to the Times-Call.

The brother told authorities that Monty Turner planned the attack in order to get his son back.

On Sunday morning, Missouri State Highway Patrol troopers pulled over Monty's father Ronald Turner, 72, driving his son's car near Springfield.

Monty and little Luke were nowhere to be found, but authorities discovered toys in the car. Ronald Turner denied helping Monty, but was arrested for being complicit in the kidnapping.

Cross-country: The case sprawled many hundreds of miles from Luke Turner's home in Longmont, Colorado

Located: The FBI and Canadian police arrested Turner at the Casablanca Motor Inn in Brandon, Manitoba, Canada, after tracking Turner through his credit card purchases

Hours later, the FBI located Monty Turner at a roadside motel in Manitoba, Canada, after tracking his credit card purchases. 

Local authorities and the FBI arrested Monty Turner and recovered Luke.

Brandy Turner said she cannot go to Canada to pick up her child because she does not have a passport, however, she hopes to be reunited with him in the next few days.

'“I don't have to live in fear. I don't know how much he understands,” she said. “"I am just so thankful that he is safe that he is OK,' she told reporters.
