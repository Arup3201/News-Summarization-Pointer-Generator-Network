A new mother was left fighting for life after a clot cut off blood supply to her heart - triggering four heart attacks.

Julie Chadwick, from Warrington, Cheshire, collapsed 10 days after giving birth, while registering her son Casper's arrival.

The now 24-year-old suffered four heart attacks and needed 13 blood transfusions.

Julie Chadwick, 24, collapsed 10 days after giving birth to son Caspar, now one. She went on to suffer four heart attacks and needed 13 blood transfusions

Doctors found a large blood clot blocking Mrs Chadwick's pulmonary artery. This had cut off the blood supply to her heart, triggering four heart attacks

Doctors discovered the mother-of-two had blood clots on both lungs, warning her partner Chris she was unlikely to survive.

But a year on, Mrs Chadwick has started university - and married at the registry office where she collapsed.

She said: 'I wanted to turn a bad thing into a positive and we decided to get married at the same time I felt ill and in the registry office where I collapsed.

'It may seem odd but it was important to turn it around and make happy memories there.

Mrs Chadwick, who is also mother to three-year-old Corey, said: 'It wasn’t just me and my husband who suffered when I was poorly, it was our boys and all of our family.

'I wanted them to have a chance to see us happy and put it all behind us.

Mr Chadwick, 29, was told his wife-to-be had a 10 per cent chance of surviving, so family and friends raced to her bedside to say their goodbyes.

A year on, she has made a remarkable recovery and married partner Chris, 29

She said: 'When I first collapsed it was all a blur. I had only given birth 10 days before and could never have guessed I could be so seriously unwell.

'Chris and I walked to the registry office to sort the birth of Casper, but when I got there I felt really dizzy and collapsed.

'Luckily there was a doctor there registering his own child’s birth and he called me an ambulance because I kept losing consciousness and went grey.'

Doctors found a large blood clot blocking Mrs Chaswick’s pulmonary artery. This had  cut off the blood supply to her heart - triggering four heart attacks.

Blood thinning drugs failed to work, causing blood to pour from Mrs Chadwick's mouth and ears, she claims.

Despite her slim chances, she recovered after doctors placed her in an induced coma.

She said: 'When I came out of the coma I couldn’t talk or feed myself and I would just dribble.

'Chris was amazing and nursed me back to health. All of our family came round to help look after the boys.'

Doctors still do not know what caused Mrs Chadwick’s clots but believe it could be a genetic mutation which affects five in every 100 people, causing her to be more susceptible to clotting.

She said: 'Before this happened to me I wasn’t 
aware that I was prone to clotting, so I just want other pregnant 
mothers to be aware this can happen - and to get checked out if they 
don’t feel right.

'After such a horrific experience I am very lucky to still be here. I can’t thank the A&E and intensive care staff enough - and my family for getting me through it.'
