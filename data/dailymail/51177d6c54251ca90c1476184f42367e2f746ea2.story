They are perhaps more used to racing their steeds, but this group of equestrians are sure to set the pulses racing of many a red-blooded man with their saucy charity calendar.

The seven girls, from Leed 
University's Equestrian Society, stripped down to their underwear and 
riding boots to bare all in the suggestive pictures.

And their efforts haven't gone 
unnoticed. Since the girls pictures appeared online, they have become 
official mascots for a battalion of soldiers currently on a tour of duty
in Afghanistan.

The students hope to raise Â£1,000 for the through sales of the calendar for the Otley and District Riding for the Disabled charity.

Laura Fielding, club captain of the 
society, said: 'It has been a fantastic experience and it was quite 
liberating riding horses with little clothing.

'It was incredible, I really bonded 
with the rest of the girls and it was great to be doing it for such a 
good cause, it's a brilliant charity and with it being so local we know 
where the money is going.'

After
a day out volunteering for Otley and District RDA, the girls decided 
that a cheeky calendar was the best way to help and in just a few weeks 
they have produced 12 nearly-nude photos.

The
charity, which was established in 1987, is a voluntary organisation 
aiming to give disabled people the opportunity to ride horses to aid 
their health and wellbeing.

Roll in the hay: Sophie Dunston is September's pin-up. The seven girls - all members of Leeds University's Equestrian Society - stripped down to little more than their riding boots

Society treasurer, Emily Du Luart, 20,
said: 'I want to be able to know that we made a significant difference 
to people who can't do anything like this a lot.

'We
ride whenever we can, so however much we raise and can give to charity 
it will make a difference to those that can't otherwise do it.

'We weren't nervous about taking our clothes off, we were more worried 
about the fact that it was three degrees. We were really quite cold. 
There won't be any awkward moments between us now.'

After a short period online a member of Company A, Fifth Battalion The Rifles got in touch.

The
girls sent signed calendars and letters to the soldiers in a bid to 
boost morale, as the soldiers have since embarked on a six-month tour of
Afghanistan.

Bare cheek: The girls are raising money in support of Otley and District Riding for the Disabled charity

Emily, who studies history, said: 'We weren't expecting it at all and were extremely honoured, proud and flattered to be asked.

'We are all interested in helping and are happy to support in any way we can. We are now their official
mascots for the six months - we've all been assigned a specific 
rifleman who is going to write back to us.

'We are obviously really supportive of them so we're delighted we can sort of officially be linked with them.'

Emily and Laura feature in the calendar along with Sophie Dunstan, Polly Young, Alice Geddes, Abi Bishop and Sophie McHugh.

They have had 250 copies made and the printers are on standby in case the orders flood in.

An RDA spokeswoman said: 'All our 500 Groups across the UK rely on voluntary help and donations to carry out their life-changing activities, and I hope the calendar raises lots of money.

'I would encourage everyone to show their support for Otley RDA by buying a copy of the calendar.'
