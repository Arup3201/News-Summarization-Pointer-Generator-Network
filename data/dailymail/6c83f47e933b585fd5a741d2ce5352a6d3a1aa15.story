Wearing mini skirts and high heels, they might seem unlikely criminals.

But police want to speak to these two women after a bus station was smashed up with a hammer.

CCTV footage shows one of the women throwing the heavy tool at glass windows at the station in Wolverhampton, West Midlands.

Scantily-clad suspect: Detectives want to speak to this woman after a bus station in Wolverhampton, West Midlands, was damaged, costing £16,000

Unlikely vandals: A woman in a short black dress holds a hammer while a woman in a black top and tight white skirt watches on

Two window panes were smashed during the incident, leaving the bus station's managers with a £16,000 repair bill.

The incident happened at about 2.10am on Saturday, August 11.

One of the women was wearing a short black dress and had red hair. The other was dressed in a tight white skirt with a black top.

They disappeared into the night shortly after the second window pane was broken.

West Midlands Police said the vandalism appeared to be carried out at random.

Pc Neil Thompson said: 'The woman repeatedly threw the hammer at the glass windows smashing two of the panes and causing £16,000 worth of damage.

'The attack seems to be completely random but thankfully the incident was caught on CCTV and we hope that those responsible can be identified from the images.'

The police appeal comes after a video showing a young man vandalising a bus shelter in Wilmslow, Cheshire, was viewed thousands of times on YouTube.

As reported by Mail Online last month, the 47-second clip showed the drunk reveller falling through the roof of the shelter.

First he tried to take a running jump on to the shelter, but failed miserably.

He tried again and managed to pull himself on to the roof, but fell through after pulling down his pants and jumping up and down in celebration.Police said the prank cost £560.'

The two women in Wolverhampton are not the first vandalism suspects to appear in unlikely outfits.

In January, a well-dressed man in suit trousers and an overcoat was filmed ripping a wing mirror off a 4x4 Porsche Cayenne in Islington, North London.

The incident was captured on a CCTV system set up by the vehicle's owner, Haydn Jones, after 30 cars in the area were keyed in the summer of 2011.

After pulling off the wing mirror, the smartly-dressed vandal proceeded to kick it down the street.
