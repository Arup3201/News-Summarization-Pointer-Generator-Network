These amateur photographers have taken on the world through their lens, capturing the most stunning and compelling images from Australian landscapes to living creatures in Asia.

It's the most prestigious nature photography competition across the globe, with more than 1300 photographs  submitted to the competition, taken across Australia, New Zealand, Antarctica and the New Guinea region.

And this year, Matthew Smith, from New South Wales has taken out the top prize of the 2014 Australian Geographic ANZANG Nature Photographer of the Year.

He was announced the overall winner for his Animal Portrait image titled 'Physalia Physalis', where he captured a bluebottle jellyfish as it was floating on the surface at Bushrangers Bay in Shellhabour, NSW.

Mr Smith won $10,000 and a holiday for two, while the nine category winners receive $1000 and the runner-up of each section and People's Choice receives $500.

But the competition is not over yet - guests are invited to the South Australian Museum to vote for their favourite 'People's Choice Award', and the winner will be announced on Friday November 21.

There are 10 sections in the competition and the judges have chosen the winners and runner-up for each category - Animal Behaviour, Animal Portrait, Botanical, Landscape, Threatened Species, Monochrome, Our Impact, Animal Habitat, Interpretive and Junior.

The winners from 10 different categories are being exhibited at the South Australian Museum until November 30 before travelling to Western Australia and Tasmania.

'Praise to the rain' by Charles H Davis, NSW: Monochrome winner - The kangaroos are captured fighting in the rain as the young roo is drenched as it watches

'Physalia Physalis' by Matthew Smith, NSW: Overall winner - 'Despite its potentially dangerous sting, the bluebottle zooid is an amazingly beautiful creature. I wanted to demonstrate this with careful lighting and composition'

'Myrtle Glade' by Ted Mead, Tasmania: Botanical winner - 'Deep in the Tasmanian wilderness remains some of Australia’s most pristine forest'

'Aerial Chat' by Ofer Levy, NSW: Portfolio prize - A little tern (Sternula albifrons) adult flies above the little tern chick as they interact

'Hairy frogfish in the spotlight' by Michael Gallagher, London: Animal portrait winner - The photographer captured the hairy frogfish, resembling a 'bright orange sponge' while scuba diving in Lembeh Strait in Indonesia

'Regent Flight' by Ofer Levy, NSW: Animal portrait runner up - This male regent bowerbird was taken at O’Reilly’s Rainforest Retreat. The beautiful bright colours are only found on the male species and tend to 'build a big bower' to impress the females during breeding season

'Australian Emperor Dragonfly' by Ian Bool, NSW: Junior winner - The photographer is 16-years-old who captured the large and fiercely territorial dragonflies. 'I spotted this individual sitting poised for take-off among the plants in my grandparents’ garden'

'Young Nankeen Kestrel hovering' by Ofer Levy, NSW: Portfolio prize - 'When their young fledged, they practised their hunting skills close to the nesting site, typically hovering about 10-20 metres above the field searching for insects and other small creatures'

'Social drinking' by Keith Lightbody, Western Australia: Threatened species winner - 'There was no wind and it was more than 30 degrees by 8am, so Baudin’s and Carnaby’s black cockatoos from the local flocks came down from the trees to the farmer’s pond for a social drink'

'What dreams are made of' by Kah Kit Yoong, Victoria: Landscape winner - It rains every second day at Cradle Mountain in Tasmania, so I was fortunate to obtain a still lake with a crystal clear reflection and a cloudless sky without the moon

'Probe' by Jesse McCoullough, NSW: Animal behaviour winner - This wasp taps her antennae which are sensitive to vibrations and scent in search of a suitable host larva upon which she will lay her eggs using her long ovipositor

'Tree of life' by Debbie Fowler, NSW: Interpretive winner - The aerial view of the low tide formed by salt lakes, tidal mudflats, mangrove swamps, hidden creeks and rivers exposes the heart of the Cambridge Gulf’s landscape on the north coast of Western Australia

'Salinity by Twilight' by Keith Lightbody, Western Australia: Our impact winner - 'During winter this parched lake gains water that runs down from surrounding paddocks which have all been cleared for crops'

'Spider in mist' by Raoul Slater, Queensland: Animal habitat winner - 'The web was built just beyond the shaded front of a garden shed and I had time to drink a coffee first and then find just the right shutter speed to capture the droplets of morning mist'
