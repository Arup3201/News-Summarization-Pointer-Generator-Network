An enraged cat owner who blamed the vets for his pet's death has been arrested after allegedly stabbing staff at two separate animal hospitals.

Charles A. Smith, 57, first tried attacking the veterinarian who treated his cat at the Maplewood Animal Hospital in Bellingham, Washington, at about 8:15 a.m.

The unnamed female veterinarian was able to knock the knife out of Smith's hand before escaping with only a cut on her hand.

KOMO News reports that on his way out of Maplewood, Smith pulled a second knife, threatened the desk staff, then drove off for the Fountain Veterinary Hospital. 

Upon arriving there ten minutes later, he walked into the building and wordlessly stabbed an employee in the neck before speeding off yet again.

That unnamed victim was treated at the scene by paramedics. 

By that time, police had alerted area animal treatment centers there was an attacker on the loose. 

Smith was finally taken into custody when a Bellingham officer pulled him over on E. Bakerview Road and he surrendered.

Smith admitted he was the man authorities were looking for.

He is now being held at the Whatcom County Jail on investigation of assault and weapons possession.

After the attacks, Smith's three remaining cats were removed by the Whatcom Humane Society.

They also seized seven birds from his RV parked behind a Trading Post Pawn and Gun on the 5200 block of Guide Meridian. 

Pawn shop employee Brad Bruland said Smith had long been concerned with the cat's health.

'He loved that cat and he'd been trying to get it help,' Bruland told KOMO.

 Smith had come into the pawn shop on Wednesday, weeping, and telling the staff that the animal hospital had given him his cat back in a box then taken him out the side door.

'That's all he cares about it his cats,' Bruland said. 'When you lose something that means a lot to you people tend to lose sense of reality.'
