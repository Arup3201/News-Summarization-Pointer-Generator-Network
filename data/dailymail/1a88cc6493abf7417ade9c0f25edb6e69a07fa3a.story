Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini insists that Frank Lampard should not be labelled a 'traitor' for making the move to the Etihad Stadium after over a decade at Chelsea.

Lampard, who signed for New York City this summer and is now  at Manchester City after signing a short-term deal, has come under fire in some quarters for moving to a rival club.

However, speaking at a press conference ahead of Sunday's Community Shield against Arsenal, Pellegrini defended his new signing: 'I don't understand the reaction of Chelsea fans that say he is a traitor.

'The problem was not that Frank Lampard did not want to sign another contract at Chelsea. Chelsea didn't want him anymore and he wants to continue playing. He is a competitive player and very important for our team.'

Pellegrini, who, admitted he was 'surprised' by Arsene Wenger continued barbs at Manchester City, also maintained that the club had done nothing wrong in making the loan move for Lampard.

When Wenger's comments were put to the Chilean, Pellegrini said: 'I think that as a manager we have enough problems worrying about ourselves without talking about other teams. What I will say is that we have important restrictions over FFP. Frank Lampard was a free player so we didn't spend anything to bring him here from New York City.'

England midfielder Lampard is not expected to be involved at Wembley on Sunday, as a host of players that have only this week returned to training set to miss out.

'Lampard is not ready to play. It is not only Lampard but all the players that arrived this week. The players that arrived this Monday are Martin Demichelis, Vincent Kompany, Pablo Zabaleta, Bacary Sagna, Fernandinho, Frank Lampard and Sergio Aguero. They have a special pre-season this week and next week.'

Pellegrini also refused to comment on the club's portracted pursuit of Eliaquim Mangala, with a £32m move still to be completed.

'I always say the same,' the Chilean said, 'When things are finished, we can talk about that. For the moment, he is not a player in our squad.'
