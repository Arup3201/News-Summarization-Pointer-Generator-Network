England stars Wayne Rooney and Joe Hart have teamed up with Unicef, the world's leading children's organisation, to help battle malaria.

The duo are part of the England Footballers Foundation (EFF) four-year partnership with Unicef to help fight the disease which still claims the life of a child every thirty seconds.

To launch the campaign the pair can be seen alongside fellow England team-mates Gary Cahill and Jack Wilshere in a striking poster to help tackle malaria - which is the biggest killer of children under five in Africa.

The EFF was first established in 2007 on behalf of the England squad following the team's decision to donate their match fees and time to chosen charity partners.

Now they plan to use their status alongside Unicef to help raise funds and awareness about the danger of malaria, globally the third single biggest killer of children, and the benefits of sleeping under a mosquito net as a life-saving measure.

The first fundraising event will take place on Thursday in London where a number of England players, including Danny Welbeck, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Wilshere will manage football teams competing for the coveted EFF Charity Cup.

It's not just England that the world's leading children's organisation has links too. 

Spanish giants Barcelona have had links with Unicef since 2006. For five years the club used to have the Unicef name on the front of their shirts up until 2011. 

The Nou Camp outfit now pay the  organisation £1.25million a year to have their name on the back of their shirts until 2016.

Superstar Lionel Messi is one of the fund's global goodwill ambassadors too. 

On being involved in the campaign Three Lions' skipper, Rooney said: 'It's unbelievable that every ninety minutes – the time it takes to play a football match – 180 children will lose their lives to malaria.

'As captain of the England football team I am hugely proud that we are able to help Unicef in its goal of protecting every child in danger from this disease.'

Hart echoed Rooney's sentiments by adding: 'I am used to defending my goal net against some of the best players in the world, but for some children, being able to sleep under a life-saving mosquito net can mean the last line of defence from this deadly disease.

'I have always been a huge fan of Unicef's work so it's really amazing that through our Foundation we can help make a difference to the lives of some of the world's most vulnerable children.'

Unicef UK Executive Director David Bull said: 'The simplest way to keep children safe from malaria is to ensure that they sleep under a mosquito net, but many are still living without this basic life-saving need. 

'The faces of the England football team are some of the most recognisable in the country so it is great to have them on board to help us raise awareness to tackle malaria and protect all those children in danger.'

Since its inception, the EFF has raised over £3.5million, provided over 150 player appearances, produced three national advertising campaigns and created exclusive EFF events.
