Hanging on the wall of their $1.3 million Bayshore Boulevard mansion is an oversized painted portrait of Jill Kelley and her surgeon husband Scott.

The ostentatious gold-framed commission no doubt adorned the wall during one of the Florida socialite's parties she famously hosted as an unpaid, unofficial social liaison for U.S. Central Command.

But appearances can be deceptive and the couple portrayed smiling widely have been sued for $4.1m of 
debts and are, as we found out this month, at the centre of the biggest 
sex scandal to rock the U.S. in living memory.

Opulent: A painting of Scott and Jill Kelley hangs inside their Bayshore Boulevard residence

Jill Kelley, a 37-year-old Florida housewife, unveiled the David 
Petraeus sex scandal when she contacted the FBI about harassing emails 
from his mistress Paula Broadwell.  

After Kelley contacted the
FBI, agents launched a massive in-depth investigation into who was 
sending the emails because they shared this detailed information that 
was not publicly available.

The catty emails, which told Kelley to 'back off' from Petraeus, were sent to Kelley from several fake email addresses.

In order to find who had confidential
information about Petraeus' whereabouts, the FBI obtained an 
administrative subpoena, and traced them back to Broadwell.

In the course of the investigation, they also unearthed emails indicating the affair between Broadwell and Petraeus, leading to his resignation earlier his month.

At
her glamorous home the lawns are perfectly manicured - the residence has six 
bedrooms and four bathrooms for the hundreds of military guests who used
to attend parties there.

A closer look, however, and you notice that the paint is peeling on the outside and wooden chairs at all rather too well worn.

Mrs Kelley boasted about serving dinner to Petraeus and his wife Holly in 2007.

The general and his wife, Holly, were pictured next to the Kelleys and Mrs Kelley's twin sister Natalie Khawam.

Each year Jill and her husband host a 
party on their extensive manicured front lawn to celebrate the 
Gasparilla Festival in Tampa.

In 2010 General Petraeus and his wife Holly attended the pirate themed festival staged at the Scott's home.

General Petraeus arrived with a 28 
motorcycle escort and mingled with more than 200 guests who dined on 
crab cakes and lamb chops.

At this year's Gasparilla festival, 
where pirate themed floats are driven through Tampa, the Kelley's hosted
military officers from 60 nations to a coalition appreciation party.

Tight security surrounded the Kelley's home during the event.

One
neighbour complained that it resulted in the street running alongside 
the Kelley's red and white painted mansion being closed off to traffic 
for the day.

'You soon 
know when Jill is having a party It's like having the president come to 
town as everything shuts down. There is security everywhere and you 
cannot move,' said one neighour.

Mrs Kelley, who said she has known 
General Petraeus and his wife Holly for five years, has visited them in 
Washington DC. She is also reported to have been invited to a breakfast 
at the White House.

In recognistion of her work with officials at CENTCOM she was recently named as a honorary consulate general to South Korea.

Mrs Kelley, is said to regard General Pretaeus as being like a grandfather to her children, aged nine, seven and and six.

Mrs Kelley and her friends and family
maintain her relationship to the four-star general was never anything 
more than friendship.

'We
and our family have been friends with Gen Petraeus and his family for 
over five years. We respect his and his family's privacy and want the 
same for us and our three children,' the Kelleys said in statement on 
Sunday.

Military 
sources say that Mrs Kelley was frequently seen in Petraeus' company at 
social events held at Central Command headquarters.

Central Command oversees U.S. 
military operations across the Middle East -- including in Iraq and 
Afghanistan. Petraeus was promoted lead the command, based in Tampa, in 
October 2008 after successfully engineering and executing the surge 
strategy.

While in 
Tampa, he worked to reorganize Central Command from its original Cold 
War era footing to focusing more on counterinsurgency.

He left Tampa in June 2010 when President Barack Obama tapped him to lead a turnaround of the war in Afghanistan.  The Kelleys have lived in the Bayshore Boulevard mansion since 2006.

Dr Kelley is head of Esophageal Oncology and Surgery at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer and Research Institute in Tampa.

He pioneered minimally-invasive, hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery of the esophagus and other gastrointestinal malignancies.

Mrs
Kelley, who drives a black Lincoln Escalade SUV, has a twin sister 
Natalie, who is a Tampa lawyer who represents corporate whistle blowers.

The
sisters, who are from Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania, near 
Philadelphia, took part in 'Food Fight,' a culinary showdown for the 
Food Network channel in 2003.

Their Lebanese-American parents still reportedly own a restaurant in Philadelphia.
