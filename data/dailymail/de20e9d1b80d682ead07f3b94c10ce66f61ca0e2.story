West Ham hope to sign Ecuador World Cup forward Enner Valencia in the next 48 hours and if Saturday’s 2-2 draw at Stevenage was any guide, he cannot arrive too soon.

The Hammers needed goals from wingers Matt Jarvis and Stewart Downing to salvage a draw after League Two Stevenage went 2-0 up through Tom Pett and triallist Connor Calcutt.

West Ham have agreed a £12million fee with Valencia’s club, Pachuca.

And Hammers boss Sam Allardyce said: ‘We’re very close, but nothing is ever certain until they have actually signed.’

West Ham co-chairman David Sullivan says he wants to make at least three more signings, with Valencia likely to be the first of those.

Valencia scored three foals for Ecuador during the World Cup.
