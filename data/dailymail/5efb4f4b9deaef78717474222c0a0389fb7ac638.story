Nicole Maines changed her name from Wyatt in the fourth grade

Although born identical twin boys, Wyatt Maines had never felt the same as brother Jonas. While Jonas played with Spiderman and pirates, Wyatt preferred Barbie and tutus.

From a young age, Wyatt did not identify with the gender he was born into and with the help of incredibly supportive parents, Kelly and Wayne, began to live life as a girl. Wyatt became Nicole in the fourth grade and now takes hormones to stop male puberty.

Nicole, now aged 14, told the Boston Globe: 'I have always known I was a girl. I think what I’m aiming for is to undergo surgery to get a physical female body that matches up to my image of myself.'

My brother and I: Nicole and Jonas Maines, 14, were born as identical twin boys but Nicole (who changed her name from Wyatt) now lives as a girl with the full support of her family in southern Maine

It has been a long struggle for the 
Maines family, from southern Maine, to have their child accepted for who she is. Along the 
way they have faced legal battles, discrimination, bullying and have moved
 home. 

After Wyatt repeatedly denied he was a boy and started acting out, Mrs Maines began doing research 
on transgender children but there was little information to be found.

The Maines were fortunately put in touch
 with the Children’s Hospital Gender Management Services Clinic in 
Boston, opened in 2007 by endocrinologist Norman Spack and urologist 
David Diamond.

Mr Maines, a 53-year-old safety director at the University of Maine, told the Boston Globe: 'I didn’t understand it all, but I saw the weight lift off Kelly’s shoulders and a smile in Nicole’s eyes.

'That was it for me. There were tons of challenges for us after that, but I knew my daughter was going to be OK, medically.'

Identical: From an early age the twins showed distinct personalities with Jonas preferring pirates and Spiderman while Wyatt preferred Barbie and mermaids

The GeMS Clinic is the first of its kind
 in the U.S to focus on children and teenagers with gender identity 
issues. They have a multifaceted team including specialists in 
gynecology, urology, social work and psychiatry.

Using hormone therapies, the clinic 
halts puberty in transgender children, blocking the development of characteristics like breasts or facial hair, which can make the final steps to the other gender more painful and expensive.

'I believed in Nicole. She always knew who she was.'

In the fourth grade, Wyatt grew longer hair and started wearing more girly clothes and by fifth grade had her name legally changed to Nicole.

Mrs Maines, 50, who works in law enforcement, told the Boston Globe: I believed in Nicole. She always knew who she was.'

There were very few problems with classmates or their parents until one boy called Nicole a 'faggot' and objected to her using the female bathroom.

The boy's grandfather complained to the school board backed by the Christian Civic League of Maine.

The superintendent of schools then decided Nicole should use a staff bathroom causing the Maines to bring a discrimination case against the school.

Jonas also ended up getting into fights to defend his sister. After several incidents of prejudice and bullying the Maines moved to a more diverse community in the state with more liberal schools.

The Maines family spoke out to help fight the deep stigma against transgender youth.

By her side: The Maines' family (l-r) Jonas, Nicole, mother Kelly and father Wayne. They have fought many battles for Nicole but have fully supported her being transgender

The transgender portion of the population has been largely ignored and vastly under-serviced for many years. All too often transgender individuals are at greater risk of social rejection, sexual and physical violence.

The shame and rejection felt by some 
can lead to self-harming behaviours, increased drug use, homelessness, 
HIV/AIDS infection, depression and suicide.

The Youth Suicide 
Prevention Program states that 50 per cent of transgender youth will have had 
at least one suicide attempt by their 20th birthday while two-thirds said they felt unsafe at 
school.

There are arguments, in particular from the Christian right, about the morality of changing gender and some doctors consider young teens too immature to make such life-altering decisions.

Close bonds: The brother and sister whisper with each other as they tell their story at the family's home in southern Maine

However Dr Spack, 68, who has decades of experience working with transgender youth and adults told the Boston Globe: 'We’re talking about a population that has the highest rate of suicide attempts in the world, and it’s strongly linked to non-treatment, especially if they are rejected within their family for being who they think they are.'

The effect of the hormone injections are striking when looking at Jonas and Nicole - the first set of twins the clinic has seen.

Jonas is 5ft 6 inches and weighs 115 pounds, is going through puberty and has developed facial hair. Nicole is 5ft 1inch and 100 pounds.

Jonas told the Globe: 'I love having a sister. We have a very strong relationship.'

Nicole added: 'I would say my brother got lucky with me. Because we grew up with only 
boy neighbours, I developed a liking to shoot-’em-up and military video 
games. I could have come out a lot girlier.'
