George Zimmerman's original painting praising 'liberty and justice' sold on eBay today for an unbelievable $100,000.

The painting, which depicted a U.S. flag in shades of blue with the words 'God, One Nation, with Liberty and Justice for All', received 96 bids from 24 bidders.

The former neighborhood watch captain posted his work online
on Monday, less than a week after domestic abuse charges against him were 
dropped when his girlfriend Samantha Scheibe chose not to pursue them.

Zimmerman's attorney, Jayne Weintraub, said her client created the artwork himself and posted it for sale.

Weintraub says that, 'unfairly, he has not been gainfully employed of late and he's utilizing his talent to make some money.'

The winner's identity has not been revealed. They will receive the personally signed, 18-inch by 24-inch oil on 
canvas via expedited mail from Sanford, Florida at a shipping cost of 
$40.

‘First hand painted artwork by me, George Zimmerman,’ the Florida resident wrote in the eBay description.

'Whoever wins within the Continental United States, will receive this painting delivered by me personally. Your friend.'

Despite the firestorm that has surrounded the Sanford man since he was acquitted of charges he murdered unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in 2012, he even manages to joke about his situation.

‘I found a creative, way to express myself, my emotions and the symbols that represent my experiences,’ Zimmerman wrote. ‘My art work allows me to reflect, providing a therapeutic outlet and allows me to remain indoors :-)’

'My art work allows me to reflect, providing a therapeutic outlet and allows me to remain indoors :-)' joked Zimmerman on the eBay auction page. 'I hope you enjoy owning this piece as much as I enjoyed creating it. Your friend, George Zimmerman'

Zimmerman's most recent run-in with the law saw him facing charges of aggravated assault, battery and criminal mischief following a Nov. 18 confrontation at the central Florida house he shared with girlfriend Samantha Scheibe (pictured)

The
 auction began with a starting bid of just $50, but news reports quickly
 fueled a bidding fray that was well past $90,000.

The auction was under the eBay username theRealGeorgeZ and is listed with the subject 'America.'

Zimmerman ended his eBay description of the painting with a friendly flourish.

‘I hope you enjoy owning this piece as much as I enjoyed creating it,’ he writes. ‘Your friend, George Zimmerman.’
