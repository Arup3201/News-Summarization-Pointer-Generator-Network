PayPal has fired an executive after less than two months in the job over an ill-advised Twitter rant in which he cursed out colleagues and called them ‘useless.’

Rakesh ‘Rocky’ Agrawal bashed his new colleagues after the company hired him as director of strategy – and then he blamed it on not knowing how to use an Android phone.

The vitriolic, spelling error-riddled tweeting began around 1.00 a.m Saturday while he was out in New Orleans and ended with him saying he quit the firm.

PayPal, whose company headquarters are in San Jose, California, has sinced confirmed Agrawal's exit by tweeting the company had 'zero tolerance' for his behaviour.

Outspoken: PayPal director of strategy Rakesh Agrawal bashed colleagues over Twitter just after 1.00 a.m. Saturday morning

Beginning of the end: The weekend started innocently enough

Agrawal has been fired with the company explaining it had no tolerance for his behaviour.

PayPal's tweet read: Rakesh Agrawal is no longer with the company. Treat everyone with respect.

'No excuses. PayPal has zero tolerance.'

Rocky’s first victim was Christina Smedley, PayPal's vice president of global communications.

'Duck you Smedley you useless middle. manager,’ he tweeted. ‘Christina Smedley is a useless. Piece of s**t.’

He then incoherently called for the head of a previously unknown employee. 

‘People who should be fire from paypal Don Christmas a pool a kick.’

The tech industry veteran then claimed he could make Foursquare a $50billion company.

‘I can turn foursquare into a $50 bill OK n company let’s chat,’ he tweeted.

Take that!: Agrawal started his profane ranting by sticking up his middle finger

Not a fan: His ranting began against Christina Smedley

More vitriol: Rocky's ranting against Smedley required two tweets

Spelling error: It is not clear who he is talking about in this tweet, there is no employee at the firm with this name

Outspoken: Rocky claimed he could make mobile check-in giant Foursquare even bigger

Spell check is free: Only Agrawal knows what this incoherent Tweet was supposed to mean

Moving on: Agrawal claimed to have quit the firm last night

Agrawal then claimed he quit the firm shortly after.

‘Oh. I quit pay a tonight because of self at son and aortic and ah our and hill e a s th.

‘S**t if h uh net,’ he added.

The outspoken executive then woke up in the morning and claimed to be thirsty.

‘Hydrate.’

He then quickly deleted the offending tweets and publicly apologized to PayPal president David Marcus and vice president of growth and global strategy Stan Chudnovsky.

His mea culpa was followed by the following tweet.

‘Day one of my next adventure? I am so ducking tired.’

Rocky then claimed the messages were 
meant for a colleague and that he did not realize were tweets instead of
 direct messages – DMs are private.

Right after he woke up: Rocky appears to be dehydrated

The apology: Agrawal apologized to multiple PayPal executives shortly after deleting the offending tweets

The explanation: He blamed android's Twitter interface

Moving on: Agrawal wrapped up his reaction to his bizarre ranting by poking fun at himself

He also blamed his new Android phone, saying he did not know how to use it.

‘The twitter interface on android and gs5 is shockingly different from iPhone, said the first explanatory tweet.

‘Last night I was using a new phone that I bought because I wanted to test experiences on android. Those messages were meant for a colleague,’ said the second.

This is not the first time Rocky has been critical of the company.

Last year he wrote an op-ed for industry site VentureBeat calling its point-of-sale service allowing customers at cash registers to use PayPal to buy groceries a 'piece of s**t.'

Agrawal, according to his Twitter profile, is attending a jazz festival in New Orleans. 

Perhaps he overdid it Friday night.
