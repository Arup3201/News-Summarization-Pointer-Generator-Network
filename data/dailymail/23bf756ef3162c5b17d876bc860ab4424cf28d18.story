As the man who claimed the first British men's singles title for 77 years at Wimbledon, you'd think Andy Murray had won enough honours this year.

But the tennis ace triumphed over another net altogether: beating football, computer games and the Royal baby to become 2013's most-discussed event on Facebook.

Murray mania clocked in at number one in Britain, followed by Baroness Thatcher's death at number two and the UEFA Champions' League final at number three.

National pride: Andy Murray's win was the high point of a hot summer - and users took to Facebook to say so

Baroness Thatcher's death and funeral in St Paul's Cathedral, pictured, clocked in at number two, though not all comment was complimentary. While some praised the former PM's legacy online, others attacked it

Sport: Perhaps surprisingly considering both teams were German, the UEFA Champions' League final at Wembley stadium beat the birth of Prince George to third place. Pictured: Bonfim Dante fouls Marco Reus

The list sheds an interesting light on the topics that dominate British life, with some unexpected results.

Two of the top ten were blockbuster computer games, Call of Duty: Ghosts and Grand Theft Auto 5, while live politics featured only once, with the introduction of the so-called 'bedroom tax'.

Sport meanwhile dominated the list, taking four of the top ten spots including Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement from Manchester United and England's success in cricket at the Ashes.

Television featured only once, with The X Factor clocking in at number eight.

All the events could soon be challenged by the death of Nelson Mandela on Thursday, which drew interactions by more than 55 million people in the first day after it was announced.

Baby mania: The birth of Prince George ranked higher globally, at number three, than it did in Britain

National pastime: Sport dominated the top ten, with Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement at number five

Perhaps understandably with about 1.2 billion Roman Catholics in the world, the election of Pope Francis was the top event globally, followed by 'election' - referring to many different countries - 'Royal baby'.

Curiously enough, the news of Prince George of Cambridge coming into the world ranked higher globally, at number three, than it did in Britain, at number four.

The social network also released lists of the places where people 'check in' the most.

Unsurprisingly, the top ten in Britain was dominated by big sporting and music venues including The O2 arena in London, Wembley Stadium, the Westfield shopping centres and the theme parks Thorpe Park and Alton Towers.

But it was the most fundamental part of human nature which won the day. The most-added 'life event' to users' timelines was a new relationship, engagement or marriage, a Facebook spokesman said.

Global power: The sheer number of Catholics in the world helped put Pope Francis' election at number one

Scale: With its 20,000 seats, it's no surprise that London's O2 arena was the most checked-in location
