A Frenchman who was in contact with one of the Charlie Hebdo killers before the massacre has been arrested in Bulgaria while trying to enter Turkey.

Fritz-Joly Joachin, a French citizen of Haitian origin, was intercepted at a border checkpoint in  on January 1, a week before the Paris killing spree.

Public prosecutor Darina Slavova said the 29-year-old had been 'in contact several times' with Cherif Kouachi, one of the brothers behind the newspaper attack. 

The arrest came as French police said as many as six members of a terrorist cell involved in the attacks may still be at large, including a man seen driving a car registered to the widow of one of the gunmen.

The 29-year-old was arrested with a European warrant alleging he had abducted his three-year-old son and was likely to take him to Syria to be educated in the principles of radical Islam.

The child has now been returned to his mother.

A second European arrest warrant cited his possible association with one of the attackers and 'conspiracy in terrorism', a spokesman for the Haskovo regional prosecutor's office said.

The chief prosecutor's office in the Bulgarian capital Sofia confirmed that the second warrant was issued on the grounds that Joachin was part of a criminal group planning terrorist acts.

The man has agreed to be sent back to France and a Haskovo court will make a final decision on the extradition on Friday, one prosecutor said.

According to the initial arrest warrant, Joachin's wife told authorities on December 30 that he was likely to take their son to Syria, that he had converted to Islam 15 years ago and had become radicalised in recent years.  

Fritz-Joly claimed he was travelling with his son and girlfriend for a holiday in Istanbul. 

Cherif and Said Kouachi and their accomplice, Amedy Coulibaly, were killed Friday by police after a murderous spree at the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and a kosher supermarket. 

The three all claimed ties to Islamic extremists in the Middle East.  

Two police officials said authorities were searching the Paris area for the Mini Cooper registered to Hayat Boumeddiene, Coulibaly's widow. Turkish officials say she is now in Syria.

One of the police officials said the cell consisted of about 10 members, and that 'five or six could still be at large,' but he did not provide their names. 

The other official said the cell was made up of about eight people and included Boumeddiene.

France said it will mobilise 10,000 soldiers today and its defence minister said the country remained at risk of further attacks.

Details are emerging of the mystery man seen with France’s most wanted woman – Hayat Boumeddiene – entering Turkey before she fled to Syria.

Mehdi Belhoucine, a 23 year old French national was already known to the country’s security forces, but it’s now been revealed that his older brother was jailed for his part in sending fighters to the Pakistan-Afghanistan area.

Mohamed Belhoucine, according to Le Monde, regularly released jihadist propaganda films produced by As-Sahab, Al Qaeda’s media outlet.

The Prosecutor at his 2014 trial stressed ‘the depth of his convictions and his jihadist relay role of propaganda on the internet.’

Before being sent for training in Afghanistan, would be jihadists were shown the latest vidoes of fighting by Belhoucine in a safe apartment.

His younger brother, then 18 and an electronics student, was often there but according to one witness he ‘just played on his console.’

When interviewed by police on another occasion two years later, he allegedly made no secret of the fact that he felt ‘particularly concerned by the situation in Afghanistan and Iraq but also in Palestine, Somalia and Chechnya.’

He said: “ I thought about going to one of these countries but not necessarily to take up arms initially. The idea would be to be there with them, to help them perhaps in the form of humanitarian aid.

‘And perhaps, if pushed, then if asked, to take up arms.’

Until named by police as the man who accompanied the wife of the killer of a policewoman and hostages in the Jewish supermarket, Amedy Couliblay, on a flight from Madrid to Turkey, Belhoucine had faded from view.

Police in Turkey say that the slim, long haired man by Boumedienne’s side in a video released of her airport arrival, is Mahdi Belhoucine.

There are now suggestions that Couliblay may have first met the senior Belhoucine brother in jail where he underwent further radicalisation.
