Living in Leicester, Leeds and Norwich is enough to give you nightmares according to dream research.

Residents of these places reported having the most bad dreams, while people in Swansea, Hull and Nottingham had the most positive dreams.

The data was taken from an online tool called Jar of Dreams that scans tweets for dream-related keywords.

This tool then analyses those tweets for negative and positive words and emoticons, such as ‘good’, ‘happy’, ‘fun’ and ‘amazing’ or ‘bad’, ‘sad’ and ‘worst’.

According to Time4sleep.co.uk, which created the tool, half of positive dreams were dreamt by people living in Swansea. This dropped to 47 per cent in Hull and 39 per cent in Nottingham. 

People in Newcastle, Cardiff, Birmingham, London, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh also reported more positive than negative dreams.

Leicester (45 per cent)

Leeds (33 per cent)

Norwich (31 per cent)

Lincoln (30 per cent)

Aberdeen (29 per cent)

The most (45 per cent) of nightmares, or dreams labelled ‘bad and sad’ occurred in Leicester, followed by Leeds at 33 per cent and Norwich with 31 per cent.

Although 33 per cent of people who reported good dreams came from Aberdeen, 29 per cent of bad dreams also came from the Scottish town. 

The top 10 places for bad dreams was rounded off with Worcester, Sheffield, Manchester, Liverpool and York. The study was taken from a sample of 4,730 Twitter users in the UK.

The data was taken from an online tool called Jar of Dreams, pictured, that scans tweets for dream-related keywords. In the past eight days, 71 per cent of people on Twitter reported having good dreams, while 29 per cent had nightmares nationally

In the past eight days, 71 per cent of people on Twitter reported having good dreams, while 29 per cent had nightmares nationally.

Weird dreams were had by 9 per cent of Twitter users since last week.

Jonathan Warren, Director at Time4Sleep, said the tool provides a valuable insight into the nation’s sleep habits:

‘We spend a third of our lives asleep, and have finally been able to use technology to gain a fantastic insight into how the nation sleeps and dreams.

‘We thought it would be interesting to see the mood of people’s dreams every night, and how the content can change depending on their work, personal life or what’s been going on in the world that day.’
