Difficult decision: Staff at Adelaide Zoo yesterday put Greater down, their 83-year-old flamingo

It survived World War II and being set upon by a gang of youths but yesterday the world's oldest known flamingo died in Australia at the age of at least 83. 

'Greater' was put down by staff at Adelaide Zoo because its quality of life had deteriorated and it was 'complications associated with old age' and arthritis, the zoo said on its blog. 

They admitted the decision had been 'difficult'.

'Greater is best known for being the world's oldest flamingo and the last Greater Flamingo to have resided in Australia,' they added. 

Greater was brought to the zoo in 1933, although records are unclear about whether it came from Cairo or Hamburg Zoo.

It arrived as a mature adult but its gender and  exact year of birth are unknown.  

The bird, who was named after its species, had been a star attraction as it would confidently approach visitors.

Greater Flamingos, characterised by pale plumage and pink bills, have a life expectancy of between 40 and 60 years in captivity, but less in the wild. 

The zoo’s chief executive Elaine Bensted told The Australian newspaper staff had taken the decision after their octagenarian bird, who was already almost blind, took a turn for the worse this week.

She said there was no more treatment that would have improved Greater's life.

The zoo's veterinary team had already put Greater on a course of anti-inflammatory pain medication to ensure its comfort after its health started to deteriorate last year. 'Greater responded well to treatment and remarkably survived the cold winter,' Ms Bensted said. 

Prime: Greater had been a favourite at the zoo over the decades. It arrived in 1933 as an adult from either Germany or Egypt

Wily old bird: Greater stunned staff with its recovery from a vicious 2008 attack that left it with a fractured skull

Seniority: Great was the zoo's oldest resident

Perfect match: Greater and Chilly were described as 'a pair of grumpy old men'. Chilly is now the last flamingo in Australia

Winging it: Greater, with his striking red wing feathers, had a companion in Chilly. Staff will check up on Chilly to see how it is affected by its friend's death

The elderly bird, whose sex is unknown, had already beaten the odds to make a remarkable recovery after a vicious attack in 2008 that left it with a fractured skull. Four youths aged 17 to 19 were charged with the attack.  

The zoo said it may erect a memorial to Greater near the heritage-listed Flamingo Grotto, the zoo's oldest exhibit, which was built in 1885.

Those were the days: When Greater arrived the zoo was home to several flamingos but because of an import ban Greater had just one companion in his twilight years, Chilly the Chilean flamingo, now the last flamingo in Australia

The flamingo is survived by companion Chilly the Chilean flamingo, 65, which is said to be the last flamingo in Australia.

Zoo staff said they would keep a close eye on Chilly to see how Greater's death affects it.

The former head of South Australia's zoos, Chris West, said at the time of the attack that Greater and Chilly were 'like two grumpy old men but they will certainly miss each other if they are apart for any length of time'.

Chilly is the only remaining flamingo in the country. Although Adelaide Zoo used to be home to several, but the zoo has not been able to replace those which have died because there is now a moratorium on the importation of flamingos, which can carry a raft of avian diseases, into Australia.
