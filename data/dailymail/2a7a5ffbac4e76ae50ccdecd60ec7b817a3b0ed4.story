Two British women endured a terrifying four hours trapped under a tourist boat after it capsized in shark-infested waters near Cape Town.

Lynette Hartman, 55, and Bronwyn Armstrong were stuck under one of the two hulls and survived by breathing pockets of air.

Fellow tourist Peter Hyett, 64, Vale of Glamorgan, south Wales, died after the charter boat, which was carrying 40 people on a seal-spotting trip, overturned just after at 2pm on Saturday.

Rescued: Bronwyn Armstrong was stuck under one of the two hulls and survived by breathing pockets of air

The two British women were found clinging 
on beneath the boat by divers looking for bodies and rescuers communicated by tapping on the hull.

With the sea temperature at less than 
10C (50F), they would have been unlikely to survive for much longer than an 
hour if they had been in open water.

Police divers gave them breathing equipment and emergency scuba training before persuading them to remove their life jackets so they could swim down and clear of the 36ft hull.

Craig Lambinon, of the National Sea and Rescue Institute, said most of the passengers were rescued by nearby charter boats.

But he said the two women ‘had 
somehow become trapped when the boat flipped and had found an air pocket
 which they were using to breathe’, Mr Lambinon said.

‘They were freezing cold as they were wearing just their life jackets and normal clothes.

‘The teams found them but they were 
very scared and it took a long time to coax them to take off their life 
jackets and swim out.

‘The women had to be coached in the water in using the breathing equipment and were eventually freed at around 5.50pm.

‘It was obviously a terrifying ordeal for them, but they should now start to recover.’

Both women were treated for 
hypothermia and Miss Hartmann suffered damage to her eyes from diesel in
 the water getting behind her contact lenses.

Survivors — treated in Cape Town 
hospitals for hypothermia and shock — said the motorboat lost power and 
took on water before being swept on to rocks.

Mr Hyett was taken to shore, where he was pronounced dead.

The dead Briton's wife and daughter Suzanne, 63, and her daughter Helen, 37, from Bournemouth, survived the 
accident and were treated in hospital.

Last night after identifying the body Mrs Hyett  said: 'At the moment things are a bit raw. It’s been such a shock.'

City of Cape Town emergency services 
spokesman Wilfred Solomons-Johannes said the two women were ‘totally 
devastated – we are offering them all the care and help we can’.

The coast around Cape Town is also 
known for a large population of great white sharks.

A second man, South African tour guide John Roberts, also died in the water.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘We 
can confirm the death of a British national in this incident. Several 
British nationals were also hospitalised following the incident, most of
 whom have now been released.’

Alive: Rescuers help survivors after the accident, which took place off in the seaside town of Hout Bay

The motorised boat, called the 
Miroshga, capsized three miles out to sea as it carried tourists from 
the fishing port of Hout Bay to Duiker Island, known for its large seal 
colony.

The South African Maritime Safety Authority has launched an investigation into the accident.

Passenger Emma Tengskog, a Swedish tourist, said: ‘I was up on the roof. Suddenly I saw a lot of water inside the boat.

‘We drifted to the rocks, then there were a lot of waves coming. One big wave hit the boat and it flipped over.’

Fisherman Alfonso Wichman, whose boat 
was the first at the scene, said: ‘The first thing we saw was the boat 
capsized and an empty life raft, and then dozens of people thrashing in 
the waves.

‘It looked like a nightmare. We were especially concerned about the children and elderly.’

The website of tour operator Southern 
Ambition Marine Safaris says safety on the Miroshga, which runs regular 
whale, dolphin and seal-watching trips, ‘is of paramount importance’.

The Hyetts, who had both been married previously, had been on holiday with Mrs Hyett’s daughter Helen since October 1.

A family friend said last night: ‘This
 is such a shock. They were so happy and enjoying life together. Sue had
 beaten breast cancer just a few years ago and they were making the most
 of his retirement and the time they had together.

‘Peter was a fabulous person and they were a great, devoted couple.’

The couple had retired to the seaside 
town of Barry in the Vale of Glamorgan, where Mrs Hyett  had grown up, 
after living in the Bournemouth area. Mr Hyett was believed to have been
 in the RAF as a younger man.

The family had been ‘happy and 
relaxed’ in the days before the accident, according to a hotel worker 
who met them when they spent Thursday night in Swellendam, 140 miles 
east of Cape Town.

Renette Henrico, assistant manager at the Aan de Oever Guest House, said: ‘They were really relaxed, in the holiday vibe.’
