Actress Amber Heard has admitted she isn't phased by the scrutiny her love life has been under she it was revealed she's dating the hottest single man in Hollywood, Johnny Depp.

The 27-year-old held hands with her The Rum Diary co-star at the premiere of his most recent film, The Lone Ranger, and has been pictured with the actor and his two children from his previous long-term relationship with Vanessa Paradis.

'If I didn't want to be scrutinised, I would have just stayed in Texas,' she told net-a-porter.com's digital magazine The Edit.

She added philosophically that 'going into relationships is just as 
difficult as coming out of them. I have never been in the situation 
where the two have overlapped. I can't imagine how difficult that would 
be.' 

In the interview, the Paranoia star is candid about her past relationships - which she has had with both men and women - but said she did not want her sexuality to be labelled.

She explained: 'I 
have had relationships, successful relationships, with men, and I had a 
great relationship with a wonderful woman.

'I will never 
beg for an easy classification or label for that moment in my life, or 
assume to know what the future holds for me. I have always been and 
always will be just who I am and I will never fake anything for anyone.'

Amber revealed how her rise to fame came after she grew up 'in the middle of nowhere with nothing.'

She left home at the age of 16 'curious and hungry' with 'nothing to lose'. After enrolling in acting classes in Austin, Texas, she decided to pursue her acting career seriously.

'I remember my biggest hurdle was that I wasn't yet 18, and it caused some problems - getting a hotel room, for instance,' she said.

'I was on my own. I forged my parents' name to be on set, because I was a minor, but I was working as an adult, I forged a fake ID, too. They (her parents) did not react ideally, as you would expect, but they also couldn't stop me.'

She gained small parts in TV shows such as The O.C before breaking into films with roles in Pineapple Express, Zombieland and The Rum Diary.

Stepping out: The couple had a date in London after his recent Lone Ranger premiere

She has four films currently in the works including Three Days To Kill alongside Kevin Costner and Autobahn with Zac Efron. 

Speaking of her career progression, she said: 'I have been doing this as the only 
means to sustain myself for 11 years - my entire adult life. People have
been calling me an up-and-comer for 10 years. I 
would rather be called that than a flash in the pan.'
