Have you ever imagined sitting through a church service while munching on a Big Mac meal?

Well, a campaign group now hopes to make the idea a reality by introducing McDonald's in to the church. 

The 'McMass' group believes more people would visit church if they could combine their communion wafer and red wine with a burger and fries.

The McMass group wants to build McDonald's in churches as a way to 'capture modern audiences' 

The group, led by Paul Di Lucca, a creative director at the church branding agency Lux Dei design, want to raise $1million to build the first McDonald's church. 

They have set up a page on the IndieGoGo fundraising site, but have so far received just $104 in donations. 

Mr Di Lucca said it was time for Christianity to 'capture modern audiences' and saw the 'iconic' McDonald's brand as an ideal way to do so. 

He conceded that some people would think his master plan 'an insane idea'. 

The group hopes to raise funds by selling memorabilia, including T shirts with the hashtag #Feast4Jesus

The group believes that by introducing McDonald's in to the church it will attract people and boost finances 

'It's time or churches to engage with entrepreneurship. By combining a church and a McDonald's we can create a self-sustaining, community-engaged, popular church, and an unparalleled McDonald's restaurant', he writes on the group page. 

He continues: 'We've all had the experience of driving through a community and seeing beautiful, old, churches that are falling into disrepair. 

'Perhaps these churches suffer from low attendance, and are only used a few days a week - they may even be entirely vacant. 

'Churches need to financially support themselves, bring in public traffic and to re-assert their position as gathering places. 

'Church architecture is wonderful are often centrally located. However these attributes are wasted without an audience.

'We need to solve this problem soon or church communities as we know them will cease to exist. The McMass Project is helping churches keep pace in the modern world.'

The project group has said they are currently seeking a suitable church partner to work with and hope to raise funds by selling memorabilia, including T-shirts carrying the hashtag #Feast4Jesus.

The campaign group said McDonald's would help churches as they are profitable and draw constant crowd

The group believe that as an 'iconic' brand McDonald's could help target new audiences to attend church 

Unsurprisingly, the controversial idea was criticised by many church-goers, who took to the group's Facebook page to express their disgust. 

One user, David Falter wrote: 'Business and Church shouldn't be in the same sentence. Don't you remember reading the scripture about Jesus being upset with a temple for making it a place to sell and buy?'

Another said: 'I’m all for innovation and doing things outside of the box but this idea is just horrific. Why not support local stores that are healthy? Ones that have things like morals and principles? Things that should accompany churches?'
