The hunt is on: Facebook plans to expand its search abilities

Facebook is looking to tackle Google by making search a much more prominent part of it social network.

In words that may scare Google, Mark Zuckerberg said: 'Facebook is pretty uniquely positioned to answer the questions people have' - and plans to build more powerful search facilities as Facebook evolves.

The social network is already tweaking its search capabilities - with any search a user makes in the top bar now stored and displayed by Facebook.

Facebook said it will now log all searches made in Facebook, which users can then see by clicking on the Activity Log button.

The company stressed that any searches you make will not be visible to other users.

However the move may spark privacy concerns about what data the website giant keeps on users, and how they will use that data in order to prove search functionality.

In a statement, the company said: 'In addition to your other activity, you'll be able to 
see the searches you're making on Facebook.

'Just as you can choose to 
delete any of your posts, you can use the same inline control on 
Activity Log to remove any of your searches at any time.'

Facebook added: 'It's important 
to remember that no one else can see your Activity Log, including your 
search activity.

'You can expect to see your Activity Log updated with your search 
activity over the next few weeks. You can access this tool by going to 
the top of your profile, and going to Search from the activity sorter.'

The eponymous Facebook search bar could be one of the most powerful tools in Facebook's armory

Facebook added that you would be able to clear your search history.

It
 follows a statement made by founder Mark Zuckerberg at the TechCrunch 
Disrupt conference in San Francisco last week - his first public remarks
 since the company's IPO earlier this year.

He said: 'Facebook is pretty uniquely positioned to answer the questions people have.

'We have a team working on search.'

He added that Facebook handles one billion search queries a day 'without even trying', and added that Facebook would 'at some point' build a more powerful search engine.

Facebook is also believed to be working with Datalogix - a controversial data company calledÂ  tracks whether people who see adverts on the site end up shopping for those products in-store.

The company uses data from around 70million loyalty cards in the U.S.

Using this data, the company can see if someone purchased a product after seeing an advert online.

Brad Smallwood, head of measurement and insights at Facebook, said, in 70 per cent of cases, every marketing dollar spent on Facebook led to an additional three dollars in sales.

The company has adopted a controversial practice by having automatic access to every Facebook user's marketing details - for instance, what adverts they have seen.

Users must visit Datalogix's site to opt out.
