Jessica Simpson has banned cell phones and cameras at her wedding tomorrow - which is being organized by the same celebrity party planner who worked on her first wedding.

The blonde, 33, is set to tie the knot with long-time love Eric Johnson, 34, at the San Ysidro Ranch in Montecito, California, which today is a bustling hive of activity.

There are strict guidelines for guests who have been sent a lengthy email with Dos' and Don'ts before the wedding weekend, which kicks off tonight with a huge July 4 bash - theme 'Let's Celebrate the Red, White and Blue' - before the black-tie affair tomorrow at 4pm.

And the invite signs off with the message: 'We hope that this weekend leaves you with memories that will last a lifetime.'

I Do: Jessica Simpson and her long-time love Eric Johnson will tie the knot on Saturday in California at a rustic-chic wedding

Settling in: Ashlee Simpson and fiance Evan Ross grabbed a drink and explored the grounds on Thursday before the wedding

To stop any photos leaking ahead of Jessica and Eric's big money magazine deal, the invite reads: 'Please note that there will be no cell phones or cameras allowed at the wedding location. We kindly ask you to leave your cell phones and cameras in your hotel room or check them in upon arrival with our security team.  Security will be checking all guests upon arrival.'

And although guests - set to include Jessica's best pal Cacee Cobb and her husband actor Donald Faison - ARE allowed to bring phones and cameras to today's Independence Day celebration - they are limited as to what photos they can actually take.

The
 email states: 'On the 4th of July, guests will be allowed to have their
 phones and cameras. We look forward to sharing the photos and intimate 
moments from this day with our guests only. We kindly ask you to refrain
 from posting images or details on your social networking sites in order
 to respect and protect our privacy. '

Incredibly, invitees still do not officially know the location of of where pop singer turned clothing millionaire Jessica and former footballer player Eric will say their vows tomorrow.

Guests were told at which hotels to say at in the Santa Barbara area - and shuttles will be ferrying them to and from the unknown location.

Only on the journey will they learn their final destination.

While tonight's attire is 'upscale casual' - for men, 'anything from a button down to a suit', and a 'summer dress or equivalent' for women, on the wedding day, guests have been urged to wear 'gowns and tuxedos' for the event, which has been described as 'rustic-chic'.

Meanwhile, Jessica already has her 'Something Old' 
as wedding planner to the stars Mindy Weiss did her first wedding to 
Nick Lachey in October 2002.

And Mindy has also organized a farewell brunch for the newlyweds and their guests on Sunday, where they will be allowed to have their cell phones and cameras and give the happy couple a send-off.

Speaking about the wedding, Mindy said: 'I'm really excited about it.'

Lighting up: The couple were spotted puffing on cigarettes as they took in the luxurious estate

Getting ready: Golf carts, party supplies and shrubbery were delivered to San Ysidro ranch in Montecito, California, early on Thursday morning ahead of Jessica Simpson's wedding tomorrow

Jessica and former NFL player Eric began dating in 2010 after they were introduced to each other at a mutual friend's party.

They got engaged just five months after they started dating, but that was over four years ago

Wedding plans suffered a major delay due to the birth of their two children, Maxwell, two and Ace, 13 months.

Trucks
 carrying party supplies, furniture and shrubbery were spotted at the 
location on Thursday morning, just hours before Jessica's sister and 
bridesmaid, Ashlee, 29, arrived with her fiance Evan Ross, 25, in tow.

Jessica and Evan drove from Los Angeles on Thursday and were spotted relaxing in the grounds of the luxury estate.

There was no sign of Jessica, who no doubt was enjoying some relaxing time before the big day.

And guests are in for a treat, as Jessica previously told Today: ''It’ll definitely be extravagant. I don't do things small.'

This will be the second marriage for Jessica, who divorced Lachey in 2006.

The pair originally planned to wed in Italy but moved the nuptials to California in a bid to make it easier for guests to attend.

It has emerged that after starting to plan the wedding, Jessica and fiancé Eric realised it would be 'too much' to ask all their guests to fly overseas.

Careful: Jessica's pals carried a number of garment bags into the resort ahead of her wedding

They had initially set their hearts on marrying on the idyllic Italian isle of Capri, where they vacationed back in July 2010.

The couple had even visited the island last year to scout destinations, visiting  Augustus Gardens and La Fontelina.

Beautiful: The San Ysidro ranch is set in Montecito and has beautiful views of the surrounding countryside

Jessica has been working hard to lose weight before the big day and has amped up her usual workout to include six miles on the treadmill daily.

The Weight Watchers spokesmodel has stuck to her meal points and does squat-and-lunge sessions with fitness guru Harley Pasternak 'three to five times a week.'

Is that the dress? Garment bags were carried in to the estate by guests although Jessica's dress has been kept completely under wraps

Party time: Guests were treated to a BBQ on Thursday night ahead of the wedding
