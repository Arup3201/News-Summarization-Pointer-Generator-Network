The distraught wife of a sergeant major broke down as he was convicted of sexually assaulting a lesbian soldier, screaming: ‘You promised me you didn’t do it.’

Warrant officer Timothy Jones, 40, was yesterday found guilty of attacking the 21-year-old after a debauched party on Army barracks.

The father of two wept as the verdict was handed down before being confronted by his wife Stacey, 36, a charity fundraiser, who stood by him throughout the case.

She was not in court but waited to be told of the outcome in a room outside. Later, she could be heard screaming ‘no’ and ‘you promised me you didn’t do it’.

Jones, who served in Afghanistan, Iraq, Germany, Northern Ireland and Bosnia during a 23-year military career, faces prison when he is sentenced next month.

He assaulted the lesbian soldier after a 12-hour drinking session at Buckley Barracks in Hullavington, Wiltshire, in May last year.

Fuelled by vodka, port, whiskey, Jägermeister and beer, soldiers from 9 Theatre Logistic Regiment partied at a barbeque before seven continued drinking shots in the bedroom of the female private’s girlfriend.

There, they danced, undressed and Jones swung his top over his head and ‘snogged’ a young male soldier who was known to have suffered from psychological problems.

The female victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, also kissed her lover, a corporal with the regiment.

After telling the other males to leave the room, Jones locked the door and texted a friend: ‘I’m lying between two lesbians, what should I do LOL?’

The female private later woke up to find he had undressed her from the waist down and was sexually assaulting her. She was in pain and froze for five minutes before waking her girlfriend and breaking down in tears, telling her what Jones had done.

Bulford Military Court heard DNA matching Jones’s profile was recovered from the shorts the female private wore to sleep that night.

An expert witness said the DNA is believed to have come from his saliva and is 103million times more likely to have been from him than any other person.

Jones told officers during an initial military police interview that the girl’s arm or leg might have touched him during the night.

Four months later, he changed his story, claiming she got on top of him while he slept.

He insisted he was ‘shocked’ and ‘sickened’ by the allegation and initially accused her of honey- trapping him.

At court, he said he was just ‘clumsy’ and an ‘old fool’ but that he was not a ‘middle-aged pervert’.

After five hours of deliberation yesterday, a panel of five male soldiers found Jones guilty of one charge of assault by penetration.

As the verdict was announced, he shook violently and wept. He sat down and cradled his head in his hands while shouting: ‘I didn’t do it!’

Jones earlier told the court that being reported for sexual assault had ‘destroyed’ his family, adding: ‘My wife has gone through hell.’

Mrs Jones, who has attended much of the trial, has supported her husband since he was reported and cried throughout his evidence on Wednesday, at one point fleeing the court room in tears.

The couple, who have been married for seven years, have a daughter who turned four last week. Jones also has a teenage son from a previous relationship.

Jones joined the Army when he was 16, inspired by his grandfather who served in the military.

During the early years he was a driver, before being posted around the world, where he mentored young soldiers.

In April 2012, Jones was made sergeant major, in what he described as the ‘happiest day of my life’.

Yesterday, he signed the sex offenders’ register but was not remanded in custody. He will be sentenced on June 12.
