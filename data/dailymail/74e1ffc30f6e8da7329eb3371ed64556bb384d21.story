The auction of an alleged sex-tape starring Marilyn Monroe, John F. Kennedy and his brother Robert, will not go ahead.

The tape was supposedly seized by police in Tulare County, California after its owner, a former Hollywood bodyguard-turned-memorabilia collector defaulted on a debt to the courts.

However, the auction, which was due to take place today, has been cancelled after owner William Castleberry settled the $200,000 debt, Tulare County Sheriff's Department said.

Mr
 Castleberrry owed $200,000 for a previous court judgement against him, 
however someone covered his costs after the auction was announced, his attorneys told TMZ.

The
 gossip site reported that Mr Castleberry’s representatives do not know 
who paid the debt for him, but that his belongings, which include the 
8mm home movie, will be returned to him.

Last week, Mr Castleberry claimed to RadarOnline
 the 8 mm film shows Monroe and the Kennedy brothers engaging in 
intercourse, but says it was not made public out of respect for Marilyn Monroe's former husband, baseball player Joe DiMaggio.

'It’s real. I had it for years and I never released it out of respect for Joe DiMaggio… I’m just sick about it and I’m desperately trying to raise money to get it back,’ he told the site.

Castleberry, 56, said he lost the tape after lawyers demanded a $90,000 balloon payment while he was paying off a $200,000 judgement for selling a fake statue.

‘They
 demanded a $90,000 payment I couldn’t afford and that is when the 
sheriff came in and seized the sex tape and all of my other memorabilia I
 have been collecting my entire life,’ he told the site.

Attorney
 Ryan Sullivan added that he heard of the tape’s existence and even 
personally found an 8 mm canister while Castleberry’s house was 
ransacked by repo men.

‘I 
was able to locate a 8 mm film in a canister at the house, which was 
turned over to [authorities],’ said the lawyer, who is representing the 
plaintiffs ripped off by the phony statue.

Sullivan noted that he has not viewed the tape and cannot verify its contents.

‘I
 have no idea what is on the tape, it could be what Mr. Castleberry 
says, or it could be a Disney cartoon,’ said Sullivan. ‘The only way 
anyone will ever know is if they buy it and view it.’

Castleberry’s valuables was supposed to be auctioned off with a minimum bid of $200,000 for the whole collection, in order to cover his debt.

The family of private eye Fred Otash, hired by the troubled starlet to record her phone calls, admitted last year that he spied on JFK and Monroe during their illicit affair, and said he filmed the tape, according to RadarOnline.
