'I wanted to give her something to remember': Gary Davies, who has been jailed for eight years for using a kitchen knife to 'saw' his girlfriend's neck

A jealous student who used a kitchen knife to 'saw' a seven centimetre gash into his ex-girlfriend's neck after she ended their love affair was today jailed.

Gary Davies, 26, locked Robyn Clegg-Gibson, 19, in her bedroom at halls in Lancaster University, where he set about giving her 'something to remember'.

He only stopped the attack when a police officer broke down the door to witness the bloody scene as Davies sliced through his former lover's neck.

Miss Clegg-Gibson survived the ordeal but has been left suffering with post-traumatic stress disorder, insomnia and anxiety.

Davies was sentenced to eight years in prison at Preston Crown Court today after denying attempted murder but admitting wounding with intent and false imprisonment.

The court heard that he had attacked the teenager in the early hours of September 30 last year after she ended their two-month relationship during an argument on a night out.

After returning to Miss Clegg-Gibson’s home at Lancaster University, where the pair both studied, Davies dealt five blows with a serrated kitchen knife because he 'wanted to leave a scar', the court was told.

Giving evidence at a three-day trial, Davies, who was described as a 'demanding' boyfriend, said he had originally picked up a pair of scissors to scare her after becoming 'angry and upset'.

'I wanted to scare her but I didn’t think scissors were intimidating enough, then I saw the knife in the drawer,' he said.

'I wanted to give her something to remember not to mess with me.

'I was losing face as I saw it with her and her friends.

'The argument was trivial but it was still on my mind. I was worked up.

'I started thinking she was going to get away with this but I’m going to get in trouble.

'I was angry and upset and I wanted to leave a scar.

'I wanted to give her something to remember every time she looks in the mirror.

'I was just stabbing everywhere.'

Ordeal: Robyn Clegg-Gibson, 19, was left with a seven centimetre gash across her neck after the attack last September. She has been left suffering with post-traumatic stress disorder, insomnia and anxiety

'Curled up in a ball on the floor bleeding': Miss Clegg-Davies was only rescued when a policeman broke in to the room to witness the bloody scene as Davies sliced through his former lover's neck with the kitchen knife

Following the break-up, Davies was let into the house to look for his keys, which he claimed he had lost during the night out.

He was asked to leave 'countless times' after Miss Clegg-Gibson became uncomfortable with him in her bedroom - but he refused.

As she phoned the police, Davies went 
into the kitchen and grabbed a knife, before returning to her bedroom 
and locking the door behind him.

Davies attacked the teenager in the early hours of last September 30 after she ended their relationship. He denied attempted murder, telling the court, 'I wanted to give her something to remember not to mess with me'

Threatening Miss Clegg-Gibson with the knife, he told her to ring the police again and tell them not to come to the address.

But a few minutes later, a police officer arrived outside and asked Davies to open the door, causing him to panic.

During the trial, Paul Cummings, prosecuting, said: 'He climbed on top of her and started to saw at her neck. She had her hand up and was trying to stop him.

'She was curled up in a ball on the floor bleeding and could feel the knife on her throat.'

Davies, who was also in his first year at university but lived in different student accommodation, was stopped when the police officer kicked down the door.

Trauma: Miss Clegg-Gibson, who told the jury during the trial that she thought she was going to die, has received counselling since the attack and is having more sessions starting next month to help her cope

Horror: Miss Clegg-Gibson's ex-boyfriend is now subject to a life-long restraining order telling him to stay away

Road to recovery: Miss Clegg-Gibson with a friend. She struggles to sleep and remains 'anxious and uneasy'

Miss Clegg-Gibson suffered a 7cm cut across her neck, which had cut deep into fatty tissue but had not severed a blood vessel or caused nerve damage.

She told the jury during the trial that she thought she was going to die and has received counselling since the attack. She is having more sessions starting next month to help her cope with her ordeal.

Following sessions over the Christmas period, her counsellor concluded that she is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, struggles to sleep and remains 'anxious and uneasy.'

A jury found Davies not guilty of attempted murder but yesterday he was jailed for the charges he admitted and has been given a life-long restraining order.
