The Obama administration began offering a $5 million reward in October for information leading to the capture of an al-Qaeda terrorist whom the George W. Bush administration had in custody but released from the Guantanamo Bay detention camp in 2006.

Ibrahim al-Rubaish, who has emerged as a spiritual leader of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), was captured by American troops in 2001 and spent five years at 'Gitmo.'

Less than two years after leaving the prison camp along with 16 other men, al-Rubaish rejoined al-Qaeda in Yemen, leaving his wife and three children to fend for themselves.

By 2009 the Jamestown Foundation, a terror-tracking think tank, identified him as AQAP's 'Mufti,' or chief religious authority. Al-Rubaish has a college degree in Islamic shariah law.

According to the Middle East Media Research Institute, Al-Rubaish called for open holy war against Americans in 2013, saying: 'It is my duty to spur the Muslims to kill the Americans, to get them out of the Muslims' land.'

Ibrahim al-Rubaish was let go from Gitmo in 2006 along with 16 other prisoners, and quickly returned to al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula – becoming its Mufti, or spiritual leader

Former President George W. Bush was under pressure in 2006 to release prisoners from Guantanamo, and did so, but his spokesman doesn't want to weigh in about al-Rubaish

Pictured in 2002, the Guantanamo Bay military detention camp in Cuba became a repository for the worst terrorists captured after the 9/11 attacks in 2001

Bush's Defense Department released him into a Saudi rehabilitation program designed to reintegrate jihadis into society. Sources describe the program's intent as similar to gang interventions in the U.S. penitentiaries – but taking place far outside prison walls. 

The Obama State Department issued a statement on Dec. 18 designating al-Rubaish as 'a senior leader of AQAP.

'He serves as a senior advisor for AQAP operational planning and is involved in the planning of attacks, an agency spokesperson said, noting that al-Rubaish 'has made public statements, including one in August 2014 where he called on Muslims to wage war against the United States.' 

The Saudi government, too, lists him among its 'most wanted' fugitive terrorists – a tacit admission that its rehab program's focus on religious re-education and social interaction with non-terrorists isn't always effective.

Judicial Watch, a center-right research organization known for collecting documents via Freedom of Information Act requests, first publicized on Monday the disconnect between the terrorist's release and his resurgence as an al-Qaeda leader.

Despite the return of several high-level former Guantanamo detainees to the terror battlefield, the administration has placed a premium on releasing more prisoners. Obama has pledged to close the detention camp.

A spokesman for former President Bush told DailyMail.com that he 'respectfully decline[d]' to comment on his own administration's Gitmo releases. 

'President Bush does not want to second-guess the President,' the spokesman said.

In an interview on Tuesday, Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton said al-Rubaish's post-Gitmo life as an al-Qaeda leader is 'a dramatic illustration of the danger of releasing these terrorists.'

'The recidivism rate is dangerously high, and to release terrorists in the middle of ongoing wars in Afghanistan, the Middle East, is reckless,' he said.

Fitton blamed 'pressure from the media, from Congress and from allies abroad' in 2006 for the Bush administration's streak of prisoner 'repatriations.'  

'George Bush did some good things in the war against terrorism. He did not adequately defend GITMO,' Fitton said.

Al-Rubaish has a college degree in Islamist shariah law and called for Muslims to kill Americans just last year

The 2001 terror attacks on America spurred Bush to action but later generated pressure which ultimately led him to relent on promises that Gitmo detainees would stay put. He and former first lady Laura Bush are shown in 2006 laying a wreath on the fifth anniversary of the attacks, just months after Al-Rubaish's release

'We know for a fact that the Saudi program that received a lot of transfers during the Bush years, had a recidivism rate of about 20 per cent.'

He conceded that the Obama administration's latest numbers show that after 2009 just 6.8 per cent of Guantanamo alumni re-engaged in hostilities. 

'But they now have a very narrow and not reassuring definition of what constitutes re-engagement,' he insisted.

'Now if you leave GITMO and call all your friends and tell them to start committing terrorism, that doesn't count.' 

Lt. Col. Myles Caggins, the Defense Department's spokesman for detainee policy, told Fox News that more than 90 percent of detainees transferred out of Guantanamo during the Obama administration 'have resumed quiet lives in various countries.'

In recent years the federal government paid more than $125 million in reward money to approximately 85 individuals who provided useful information that either led to terrorist captures or prevented international terror attacks.
