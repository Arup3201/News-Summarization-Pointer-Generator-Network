Bill Shorten has delivered his traditional Christmas message to the nation but his 'singsongy' speech didn't sit well with everyone due to poor quality and supposed 'insincerity'. 

The opposition leader was filmed in front of a Christmas tree in a parliamentary office  and a version was uploaded to the Australian Labor Party's YouTube account on Tuesday.

An echo in the background, noise from someone in the room and his at times high pitched voice has been mocked by viewers since it appeared online.

Mr Shorten started off saying he was personally looking forward to relaxing with family and discovering a 'whole new supply of jokes and zingers from the Christmas crackers'.

On a more sombre note, he then paid tribute to Australian soldiers across the world, along with emergency services personnel working at Christmas to keep the rest of the country safe. 

'And then there's heroes who don't wear a uniform - Australians working unsociable hours to make ends meet and to make our community a better place,' he said. 

'Perhaps we could all try and do something to bring a little bit of Christmas cheer into their lives, to dedicate ourselves to making their 2015 better than 2014.'

The opposition leader's delivery drew criticism from viewers who claim Mr Shorten's at times high-pitched voice proved he was being 'insincere'

But it wasn't the content of his speech that drew criticism - it was his delivery. 

'Oh dear. A singsongy insincere speech unfortunately Bill. Please, we want the real YOU, not your speech delivery practice!!' one user posted on the YouTube video. 

'He just needs a morning Scotch to perk him up some... and some good comedy might eventuate, I miss Keating schooling the Libs!'

Another wrote: 'Worth about 7.5 out of 10 on the sincerity scale I reckon. You're trying way too hard to be sincere Bill. Have a word with the spin doctors, speech writers and PR people. You have a little bit of work to do in my worthless opinion'.

Tony Abbott's message, which was also took place in front of a Christmas tree, was a much higher quality and appeared to have professional lighting for filming

Tony Abbott's message, which was also took place in front of a Christmas tree, was a much higher quality and appeared to have professional lighting for filming. 

The prime minister, alongside his wife Margie, paid tribute to families spending Christmas apart and those grieving for relatives in his annual message.

'This year, we are thinking of those families who have lost loved ones,' he said on Wednesday. 

'The last fortnight has been a heartbreaking time for our country.

'The thoughts and prayers of everyone are with those who are grieving this Christmas.'
