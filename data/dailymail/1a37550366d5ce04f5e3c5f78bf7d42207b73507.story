A married father of three who used an alias account on a dating app has been accused of raping a woman who he met while on a date.

Devin Richard Hartman, 40, of Mableton, Georgia used the name 'Zach Anderson' on an OkCupid account, and met up in June with a 26-year-old woman who he met on the app.

The woman reported having six beers while with him at a bar before later waking up on her doorstep without her keys, cell phone or underwear, and believes she was also drugged.

An exam conducted the day after they met determined she had been sexually assaulted, and Hartman was charged with rape and aggravated sodomy on Monday.  

While she was at Grady Memorial Hospital where she had the exam, drugs were not found in her system, however, police said drugs could have been out of her system by the time of the screening, according to the AJC. 

The woman and Hartman met on June 20 at TAP bar in Midtown Atlanta, and she was under the impression that she was meeting with Zach Anderson.

The woman told investigators she had drinks with Hartman before her date dropped her off at her car. 

She later blacked out and woke up on the doorstep of her Brookhaven home.

The next day, she went to Grady Memorial Hospital where she took an exam that determined she had been sexually assaulted.

Police were able to link Hartman to the alleged assault through phone records and DNA evidence, according to My Fox Atlanta. He was arrested on March 2 and is currently being in held in the Fulton County jail.

Lt. Celeste Murphy said there are details regarding the investigation that have led them to believe the assault possibly happened in one of their vehicles, according to WSB-TV.

'What led to closure of this investigation was that we had a courageous victim that did come forward in a timely fashion,' she said. 

Hartman reportedly had hundreds of interactions with women on the OkCupid app while using the alias, and police are now seeking other potential victims who may have had meetings with him.

There are no other allegations of sexual assault so far, according to police, and Hartman is set to appear in court on April 6 for a bond hearing.
