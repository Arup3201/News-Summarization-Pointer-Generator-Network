Julia Tapper lost her fiancée, Marine Lance Corporal Matthew R. Rodriguez, when he was killed in Afghanistan last year, and so she was always sure to hold on tight to the personal poem she wrote for him as a way of remembering her fallen solider, which was found in his helmet when he lost his life in the line of duty.

Now, tragedy has struck again for Miss Tapper, as a thief broke into her truck in broad daylight this weekend, stealing a purse that contained not only her treasured poem, but also LCpl Rodriguez's iPhone, which was filled with personal photos and videos of the couple, including their engagement video.

LCpl Rodriguez was just 19-years-old when he died.

The truck, which had belonged to LCpl Rodriguez, was parked in the lot behind the restaurant Miss Tapper works at in New Bedford, Massachusetts on Sunday afternoon when somebody broke the driver's side window and took her purse.

The break-in happened sometime between 11am and 4pm. 

She is not looking for her purse back and does not care if the thief is caught or charged, she just wants back those few things she has to remember the man she loved.

'I would do anything to have it back - just that stuff. Keep the purse. It wasn't even that nice,' Miss Tapper told MyFoxBoston.com.

'If ever there is a tomorrow

When we are not together

There is something you must remember...'

This is how the poem began that Julia Tapper wrote for her fiancé, Lance Corporal Matthew R. Rodriguez, before he was deployed to Afghanistan last fall. He carried it with him everywhere, and it was found in his helmet when he was killed while serving his country, less than three months after he arrived overseas.

'We had a huge future ahead of us. We wanted to do so much, and travel. He couldn't wait to start a family and I couldn't wait to start a family.' 

'I just hope somebody could just drop it off if they still have it, or write a note where they threw it.' 

Both the phone and poem are priceless to Miss Tapper, a way of always keeping part of LCpl Rodriguez, who was killed by an improvised explosive device on December 11, 2013, with her. His death came just two and a half months after he was first deployed.

'It was with him on his person when he was killed in action. You can replicate the poem but not the one he had on him when he was killed serving his country,' said Lisa Rodriguez, Matthew's mother.

'[Julia] lost the love of her life, and all the plans she had for her life revolved around my son,' she added. 'He loved her very much, and our family was better with her in it.'

LCpl Rodriguez, an accomplished baseball and hockey player, enlisted in the Marine Corps on August 20, 2012, shortly after graduating from Greater New Bedford Regional Vocational Technical High School. His father, Rod, had also served in the Corps.

“I just remember him always saying he wanted to do what his dad did — to be a Marine,” high school classmate Ian Soares told The Boston Globe.

It was after he finished boot camp that LCpl Rodriguez proposed to Miss Tapper.

He was described by friends as being devoted and loyal to a fault, and loved being an uncle, being a United States Marine, and his truck.

That 2001 GMC pick-up is now one of the only things Miss Tapper has left to remember her beloved.

'Every time I sit in it, it's just like an instant calmer,' she says.

Anyone who may have any information about the theft is urged to contact the New Bedford police.
