Surfers took to the waves in their droves yesterday despite warnings to keep out of the water because of dangerous conditions.

Authorities issued warnings about waves pounding the central California coast that left a swimmer missing and caused a marijuana smuggling boat to crash onto a beach.

Lifeguards conducted dozens of rescues and the massive surf also caused some damage to the Ocean Beach and San Clemente piers.

A high surf advisory was in effect until 5pm Friday after high tide and a winter storm off New Zealand combined to bring waves of up to 10-feet high pounding beaches from San Luis Obispo to San Diego.

The powerful surf probably forced a smuggling boat to crash on a Southern California beach where more than 500lb of marijuana washed ashore, authorities said yesterday.

California State Parks rangers found the abandoned boat split in half on rocks near Point Mugu northwest of Malibu.

Waves reaching 6 to 9ft and 'probably a lot of misjudgment by the cartel operating the boat' led to the crash, said Lindsey Templeton, a superintendent for the park system.

'Obviously they didn't check the surf or they risked it anyway,' he said.

Authorities warned swimmers and surfers to be careful because of high waves and strong rip currents that hit Central and Southern California through the day.

The Coast Guard suspended its search for a missing body-boarder after a fruitless overnight hunt that covered 78 square miles of ocean.

Jowayne Binford, 24, of Long Beach, was with three friends when he disappeared on Wednesday evening about 200 yards off the Surfside area of Huntington Beach.

Rip currents are strong channels of water flowing out to sea that quickly exhaust swimmers who struggle against them. Authorities recommend that swimmers caught swim parallel to the shoreline until they are out of the current.

'We could tell yesterday the waves were getting a lot bigger and the current was getting strong. The yellow (warning) flags were waving,' said Rhonda Selmanson, who has lived in a seaside home at Sunset Beach for three years.

To the delight of surfers, occasional 20-foot waves slammed into the Wedge, a popular body-surfing spot at Newport Beach in Orange County.
