Ed Miliband yesterday promised to increase the education budget every year – and echoed Tony Blair’s landmark 1997 election pledge to keep primary class sizes to a maximum of 30.

Mr Miliband told an audience at his old secondary school that if he wins office in May, spending on education will benefit from a ‘real terms’ increase every year of the next Parliament.

He accused David Cameron of planning to inflict ‘big cuts in spending’ which would ‘short change our children’s future’ if he is elected for a second term.

Labour leader Ed Miliband promised to create thousands of new school places in England to cap class sizes for five, six and seven year olds

But the Labour leader’s promises were already unravelling last night as the Institute for Fiscal Studies think-tank suggested that the Labour and Tory plans came to virtually the same amount of money, with the Conservatives potentially spending even more. 

Mr Miliband announced he would put £180million a year into capping class sizes at 30 pupils for five to seven year-olds.

Mr Blair, in his five-point pledge card for the 1997 election, had promised to cap class sizes at 30, and laws to ban classes bigger than this were enacted in 2001. 

But by 2006 it emerged that nearly 30,000 pupils in 910 infant classes were being taught in groups larger than the legal limit, although Labour claimed at the time that the number of pupils taught in oversized groups had fallen by 477,000 between 1997 and 2006.

Mr Miliband has blamed the Coalition for allowing the number of young primary school pupils in classes of more than 30 to treble from 31,265 to 93,345 in four years. 

Exceptions are only meant to be permitted in special circumstances such as to allow twins to be in the same class, or Armed Forces children to get a place at their local school.

Mr Miliband said that to take account of these exceptions, Labour would ban class sizes of more than 30 for any longer than 12 months.

He said the 30-pupil cap would be delivered by halting the creation of new free schools in areas where there are already state schools for children to attend.

The Labour leader, speaking at Haverstock School in North London, said education ‘is the passport to success in life’, adding: ‘The next Labour government will protect the overall education budget. Rising budgets, protected in real terms, every year.’ 

The move is part of Labour's plan for education in England, including the appointment of new local 'directors of standards' to drive up schools' performance

He won praise from teachers’ unions, but the Conservatives claimed that their spending plans, outlined by Mr Cameron last week, would actually involve spending more over the next five years.

The Prime Minister said he would keep the amount of funding per pupil – around £4,200 a year in primary school and £5,300 for secondary pupils – the same for the period.

This amounts to a real-terms cut per pupil, because it takes no account of rising inflation. 

But the schools budget will go up because the number of schoolchildren aged between five and 15 will rise by 7 per cent in the next five years.

The Conservatives say this means they will spend £204.62billion on schools in the next Parliament, while Labour would spend slightly less at £204.03billion.

A spokesman for the Institute for Fiscal Studies said the policies ‘present different risks. If inflation is higher than expected then a cash freeze per pupil could be less generous. 

If the number of pupils increases by much more than expected, then it would be the other way around’.

The IFS said the Tories have only promised to protect schools at age five to 16, not early years or sixth form, giving Labour flexibility to spend more in these areas.
