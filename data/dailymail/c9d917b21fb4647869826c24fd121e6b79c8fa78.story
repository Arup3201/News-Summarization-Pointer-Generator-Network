When Brendan Rodgers had finished, it became clear that he had splattered a few egos across the four walls of the visitors’ dressing room at St Jakob Park.

‘Soft’ he labelled Liverpool's players after they failed to show a response to a goal scored by Basle’s evergreen striker Marco Strellar in the 52nd minute. It is impossible to disagree.

Rodgers had every right to tear into them because he expected something vastly different to this when his summer spending soared beyond £100m.

Where has their crisp passing game gone? What happened to the attitude that took them to within two points of winning the Barclays Premier League title? Bring it back, quick.

Ratings by Neil Ashton in Switzerland

While we are here, there is also the unfortunate footnote to Liverpool’s fourth defeat and the moment when Mario Balotelli undermined the authority of his manager by refusing to acknowledge Liverpool’s travelling fans. You could hear Rodgers whistling at him amid the bedlam in the stands. 

‘I don’t know if he came back out,’ added Rodgers, but it was clear that Balotelli was already showered and sitting alone on the team bus.

It was unacceptable, an affront to the couple of thousand or more Liverpool supporters who made the trip to Switzerland to watch their team on a Champions League night. They deserve better.

Liverpool’s players have to give it to them because the stellar names in this squad should be showing signs that they are equipped for the twin challenge of domestic and European football. As yet they are not.

Dejan Lovren, Javier Manquillo, Mario Balotelli, Lazar Markovic, Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert should be loving life at a club who finished runners-up in the Premier League last season.

‘I’m not happy with the intensity,’ admitted Rodgers and there isn’t a soul who watched that performance who could possibly disagree.

Jose Enrique, who returned to the team for the Capital One Cup tie against Middlesbrough last week, was dreadful.

Twice he failed to read the passes of Steven Gerrard, allowing one to roll under his foot and then bizarrely kicking the ball at Ahmed Hamoudi with an attempted pass.

For this team to be given the runaround by Streller - who was exceptional - Geoffrey Serey Die, Breel Embolo, Ahmed Hamoudi and the rest of the gang at Paulo Sousa’s disposal is unacceptable.

You only have to witness the celebrations when Swedish referee ended the agony for Liverpool four minutes into stoppage time to know that. This is another famous victory for Basle.

Wince, then, because Carlo Ancelotti’s rampant team - who beat Basle 5-1 and - are up next at Anfield. After that, it is on to the Bernabeu for the return. 

Liverpool need a crash course in winning football matches, or else this season could soon turn into catch up.

They were beaten here when Streller, Basle’s hard-working captain, was first to react to Mignolet’s failure to clear Martin Skrtel’s misdirected clearance.

This one couldn’t possibly be pinned on the Liverpool goalkeeper, but nevertheless Streller gobbled up the chance to put Basle into the lead. They never once looked like losing it.

At times, especially in the first half, Liverpool approached this game like a one-off. Every chip they had seemed to be on red.

With victory secured in their opening group game, there was no need to pile forward in search of more glory.

Balotelli had started well, unaware of the criticism from Jamie Carragher - ‘I can’t help the way I feel about him’ - in the Sky Sports studio. Others will share his view now. 

He started well enough here, ducking and diving between the role of target man and genuine goal threat until Basle’s defence got to grips with him.

His cute little touches on the spin, angling the ball into the path of the onrushing figures of Raheem Sterling or Markovic in the opening minutes should given him the confidence to make this his night.

Little Sterling was busting a gut, punished for offside when he eventually rolled the ball into the net after two minutes and later booked for a foul in the first half.

His lunge on substitute Derlis Gonzalez at the start of the second half could easily have been a penalty. 

Liverpool gave the ball away too cheaply here, surrendering possession on the halfway line when they should have been trying to take the sting out of the game.

Sousa’s side has a good record against English opposition, raising themselves in recent years to record impressive wins against Manchester United, Chelsea and Tottenham in European competition.

Mignolet made a couple of decent first half saves, first from Mohamed Elneny’s curling shot from the edge of the area and then with his feet to stop Serey Die.

At times there was a look of panic about this Liverpool team at times, uncertain in their approach work.

Any more of this and the writing really will be on the dressing room wall.
