Sir Dave Brailsford likened it to the ‘initial jabs of a boxing match’; a moment when the main contenders in this year’s Tour de France flexed their muscles for the first time.

That moment arrived on the steepest gradient the riders will encounter during this entire three-week race.

It came on the 33 per cent incline of Jenkin Road in Sheffield; a residential street which has handrails for pedestrians who struggle with the severe gradient and which must have burned out more than a few clutches.

As the most serious threat to 
Britain’s Chris Froome, Alberto Contador was determined to make the 
800-metre ascent — some five kilometres from the finish — look as easy 
as possible.

Rising out
 of the saddle and dancing on the pedals in that distinctive rocking 
style, the Spaniard glanced over one shoulder and then the other as if 
to say to Froome ‘Where are you? How you finding the pace?’

Froome’s
 response was to deliver one of those trademark bursts he uses to 
greatest effect on the slopes of the Alps and the Pyrenees.

A sudden acceleration that propels him off the front of the peloton and crushes those left in his wake.

Only
 Froome was not trying to put any time on his rivals, or win this stage.
 Not least because it is far too soon to be defending the yellow jersey.

No,
 he simply wanted to show his rivals, much as he did on a similar ramp 
on the second stage in Corsica last year, that he could open up a gap on
 them at will.

He pulled
 a few metres clear and then eased off the gas as he passed over the 
summit, enabling the leading contenders to regroup.

Vincenzo
 Nibali — perhaps third favourite this year having won the Giro D’Italia
 in 2013 — then attacked on the run in to Sheffield to snatch the stage 
and take yellow with a two-second lead.

In
 truth, most of the field could have taken yellow off Marcel Kittel, the German finishing the punishing 201km stage from York 
racecourse almost 20 minutes down.

‘I
 think what we saw was more psychological than anything at this stage of
 the game,’ said Team Sky principal Brailsford of that Jenkin Road 
ascent.

‘It’s only 
stage two so it’s like the initial jabs of a boxing match. Chris wasn’t 
having a go. It wasn’t an attack. The fact that Nibali is in yellow 
works for us. They have to defend it now.

‘Nibali
 is a bike racer. That’s why people like his style. He saw his 
opportunity and he seized it. It was great to see. Good luck to him. 
We’re not unhappy about it because it’s only two seconds.’

Froome declined the opportunity to discuss his performance in the context of his rivals.

He
 did make the valid point that going over the summit of Jenkin Road 
first gave him a clear view of the tricky descent that followed. 

But
 Geraint Thomas led Froome into the final climbs of the day, shielding 
his team leader against a stiff wind when required, and could see what 
was happening come that last, nasty rise. 

‘It was great racing and on Jenkin Road all the GC (general category) guys tested each other out,’ he said.

‘Everyone wanted to be at the front and when one person eased up another one had a go. It was just having little digs.’  

Once again they raced against the backdrop of some stunning Yorkshire scenery, benefiting from back-to-back sunny days.

With nine category climbs to test the best and make sprinters like Kittel suffer, the stage drew yet more astonishing numbers.

The
 organisers claimed some two million spectators lined Yorkshire’s roads 
on Saturday and by Sunday night Christian Prudhomme, the race director, 
was estimating that five million had turned out over the entire 
weekend. 

‘It was a 
tough stage today,’ said Froome. ‘Undulating all day with a big fight 
for position. But the crowds out there were incredible.

'The
 support we’ve had from Yorkshire has really been out of this world. At 
times today I had goosebumps all over me. It was massive.’

After
 leaving York a seven-man breakaway was formed with Cyril Lemoine 
acquiring enough points over the climbs to secure the  Polka Dot jersey 
come the end of the day.

They
 rolled past a cornfield that had been transformed into a huge 
advertising hoarding for Emmer- dale’s chief sponsors, and struggled 
over the Cote de Blubberhouses before rolling up Cragg Vale — a gentle 
climb but the longest  continuous ascent in the country at 5km.

In
 all, there was 3,000m of climbing on Sunday but no ascent looked 
prettier than the cobbles of Haworth village; once the home of the 
Bronte sisters.

A crowd
 of 60,000 turned Holme Moss into something resembling an open air rock 
concert. ‘Holme Moss was incredible,’ said Thomas.

Holmfirth, otherwise known as home to the beloved characters from Last of the Summer Wine, looked pretty damn splendid, too.

It
 was close to there that Richie Porte was involved in a relatively minor
 crash but Froome’s chief lieutenant did well to recover from the two 
minutes he lost waiting for a new bike.

In the end he finished safely two places behind Froome.

‘With
 around 35km to go it was really steep, up and down and the Garmin team 
put the hammer down so there were only 20 guys left,’ said Thomas. ‘But 
Chris and Richie came through in good shape and that was all that 
mattered.’

Froome 
agreed. ‘It was more about staying out of trouble,’ he said, before 
joining his colleagues on the team bus for the journey to Cambridge for Monday’s stage into London.

‘All the main contenders were putting in a few moves. It was really just a case of making sure we didn’t lose any time.’

And letting the main contenders know he can hurt them whenever the mood takes him.
