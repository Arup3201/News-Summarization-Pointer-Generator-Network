The NFL is conducting an investigation to determine if the team used artificial crowd noise at home games during the last two seasons.

'I think what we've done in 2013 and 2014 was wrong,' Blank said. 'Anything that affects the competitive balance and fairness on the field, we're opposed to, as a league, as a club and as an owner.'

Blank described the investigation as 'obviously embarrassing.'

The owner said he expects the NFL to report its findings in the coming weeks, according to Sports Illustrated.

If the team is found to have pumped fake crowd noise into the Georgia Dome  while the opposing team huddled, trying to call a play, the Falcons could be fined or lose a draft pick.

Blank told WSB-TV that he hopes it's the former rather than the latter.

'We've gotten some information from the league but until we read the full report and until they publish their findings, we can't be totally clear,' Blank said, according to WSB-TV.

'We've talked to a lot of people and we've cooperated and we'll be anxious to read the report.'

'This felt like the right fit from the beginning,' Quinn said, 'and I want to thank [owner Arthur Blank] for his resolve as this was an extended and complicated process.'
