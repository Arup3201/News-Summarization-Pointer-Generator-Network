Australia's men's basketball team have had their world cup campaign turned on its head after they were accused of deliberately losing to Angola.

The third-round match against their less-fancied rivals took a stunning turn  late in the third quarter when the Boomers seemingly gave up hope - letting a 15-point lead slip out of reach - to go down by 91-83.

The stunning eight-point loss puts the Boomers in a position to avoid playing America in the world cup quarter final and many believe this was incentive enough for the team to 'tank' against Angola.

Boomers coach Andrej Lemanis said suggestions of tanking were ridiculous and defended Australia as a nation that competes in the interest of fair play.

'We always, as Australians, compete the right way,' he said.   

When asked whether he accepted that some Australians would view the loss with an air of scepticism, Lemanis said: 'People will make up their own minds.'

'There's always going to be speculators. I can't control what people think.' 

The Boomers were chasing a fourth straight victory for the first time in World Cup history, and for most of the match were cruising before the wheels fell off.

Guard Chris Goulding shot a team-high 22 points as the Boomers opened up a 15-point buffer.

It was also an opportunity to see highly-rated No.5 NBA draft pick Dante Exum in action, and the 19-year-old didn't disappoint - scoring 12 points and handing out six assists in his 31 minutes on court.

Despite fielding a second string team Australia was still the heavily backed favourites at $1.17

But an Angolan charge, led by dynamic young star Yanick Moreira's outstanding 38-point display, started midway through the third quarter and they cut the lead to just two at the final break.

The onslaught continued thereafter as Australia carelessly gave up the ball, committing 18 turnovers, and played lacklustre defence as the clock wound down in the eight-point loss - prompting the tanking calls.

Sports betting agency Sportsbet.com.au refunded $125,500 in bets placed on the Boomers to win the match in light of the allegations.

The side was an unbackable $1.17 to win with Angola the $5.20 outsiders.

'Punters bet on the Aussies in good faith not knowing they would be resting a few of their guns and giving their reserves a go, so we think it's only fair that they get their money back to enjoy over the weekend,'  the agency's Shaun Anderson said.

Former Boomer Shane Heal defended the tactics and said Australia were well within their right to want the best chance of winning a maiden medal. 

'[It is] un Australian not to give yourself the best chance to medal,' he wrote on Twitter.

'No medals given on pool placings. Pathway to final 4 is the key.' 

'There's still games to be played that will determine the outcome of the pool.

When pressed about  allegations of premeditated tanking tactics post match, Lemanis responded:   

'Nobody likes losing. (The loss) doesn't guarantee us third spot

He said the team had 'no control over that game.' 'That was always the case coming in.' 

Securing third spot would mean Australia would avoid a quarter-final show down against America and conveniently put them in a position to challenge for a maiden medal at the tournament. 

Former Australian basketball great Shane Heal said  if tanking was on the agenda, it was something that he supported in an effort for the Boomers to win a maiden world cup medal.

'[It is] un Australian not to give yourself the best chance to medal,' he wrote on Twitter.

'No medals given on pool placings. Pathway to final 4 is the key.'

But most shared a different view to Heal on social media - with one Twitter user comparing the match to Australia's infamous underarm bowling scandal.

The strategy employed by the then captain Greg Chappel gave New Zealand no hope of winning when his brother Trevor bowled an underarm ball on the final play of the match.

If the Boomers finish third they will play either Lithuania or New Zealand in the quarter-finals.
