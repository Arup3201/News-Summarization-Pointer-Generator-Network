Eugenie Bouchard's strong record in Grand Slam tournaments continued at the Australian Open on Wednesday when she beat Kiki Bertens of Holland 6-0 6-3 to advance to the third round.

The seventh-seeded Bouchard won the match in 54 minutes. Two of Bertens' three game wins came on breaks of Bouchard's serve, including when the Canadian was first serving for the match. 

Canadian Bouchard admitted in her on-court interview that she lost focus a little in the second set after breezing through the first in a mere 23 minutes.

She said: 'I'm glad I was finally able to hold my serve - and hold me serve at the end.

'It's fun to play here at night, it's a special atmosphere.'

After advancing to the semi-finals last year in her first appearance at Melbourne Park, Bouchard improved to a record of 7-1 in Australia. 

The losing finalist at last year's Wimbledon tournament, Bouchard has 25 wins and seven losses in majors. She is playing in just her eighth Grand Slam event.
