Brazil legend Ronaldo appears to be trying to keep everybody happy after revealing that his ultimate team contains three Argentines, two Real Madrid heroes, two ex-Barcelona stars and a couple of Luis Enrique's current squad.

Speaking to Spanish newspaper Mundo Deportivo, the 38-year-old, who also enjoyed a spell at the Nou Camp, picked just two of his compatriots in his all-time dream team.

Opting for a fashionable 3-4-3 diamond formation, Ronaldo chose Athletic Bilbao legend Jose Angel Iribar in goal. The former Spain No 1 made 466 appearances for the Basque side, helping them to Copa del Rey triumphs in 1969 and 1973.

The Brazilian's back- three consists of his former international team-mate Cafu, ex-West Germany captain Franz Beckenbauer and AC Milan favourite Paolo Maldini.

Ronaldo played alongside Cafu for Brazil for 12 years and enjoyed a season with Maldini at the San Siro in 2007-08. Former Bayern Munich defender Beckenbauer makes the team after winning four Bundesliga titles and the 1974 World Cup.

Ronaldo's midfield is dominated by former Barcelona and Real Madrid greats, although he reserves a spot for former Spain midfielder Xavi, who is still representing the Catalan club.

Argentina hero Diego Maradona and Johan Cruyff, both of whom pulled on the famous blue and red shirt, are given spots on either wing in Ronaldo's XI.

France World Cup winner Zinedine Zidane, who played alongside Ronaldo at the Bernabeu between 2002 and 2006, is placed in an attacking midfield role behind a deadly three-man attack.

The ex-Inter Milan forward opts for another Argentine, Lionel Messi, wide on the right, Real Madrid legend Alfredo di Stefano through the middle and Brazil great Pele on the left.

It's no surprise to see Pele, undoubtedly one of Ronaldo's heroes, in the side, while he will have been made well aware of Di Stefano's goal-scoring achievements in the Spanish capital.

But there's no place for Real's current Ronaldo, Cristiano, despite his extraordinary goal-scoring form for Los Blancos since joining them from Manchester United in 2009.

The Portuguese star is La Liga's top scorer with 25 goals in just 14 games this season but he misses out to Messi, who will also be looking to beat him to the Ballon d'Or in January.
