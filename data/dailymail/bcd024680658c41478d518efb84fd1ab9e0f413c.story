Arsenal midfielder Mathieu Flamini has wasted no time in letting Cesc Fabregas know of Arsenal's latest bit of silverware following their Community Shield success over Manchester City on Sunday.

The 30-year-old took to his official Instagram account to express his delight at Arsenal's second trophy in just four months as he posted a photo of fellow midfielder Tomas Rosicky and himself with the shield after the game - making sure he tagged the former Gunners skipper in the process. 

In what can only be described as playful banter from Flamini, Fabregas will no doubt see the funny side of it as he prepares for the Premier League season with new team Chelsea.

Euphoria: The Gunners earned their second piece of silverware in just four months on Sunday

The Spaniard signed for the west Londoners for £27m earlier this summer, after his former side make it clear they weren't in the market for him.

The 27-year-old spent eight years at the Gunners before departing for Barcelona three years ago, but he has now returned to England's top flight as a Chelsea player.

The Gunners begin their Premier League campaign at home to Crystal Palace this weekend, while Chelsea travel to newly-promoted Burnley for their opening game in a week's time.
