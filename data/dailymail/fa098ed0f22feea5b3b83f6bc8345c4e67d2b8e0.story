For years, it has been used as a metaphor for a never-ending job.

Now the Forth Rail Bridge could soon be recognised for more prestigious reasons than simply the continual need to keep re-painting it.

The bridge, described by some Scots as the eighth wonder of the world, has been invited to prepare a formal bid for World Heritage Status, which would place it alongside such landmarks as the Taj Mahal and the Great Wall of China.

Never-ending... at least until last Christmas: The paint job was started in 1883 when the bridge was built and continually needed re-coating due to the elements. It was finally finished in December (above) thanks to some super-strong paint

The crossing was included on a shortlist submitted to Unesco - the body which awards the honour - earlier this year.

An independent expert group has now recommended that the Forth Rail Bridge bid should go forward.

The bridge, which spans the Firth of Forth, became famous because the task of painting the structure was an endless one.

It was finally completed last December thanks to a new super-tough paint and it shouldn’t need doing again for 25 years.

Work in progress: The rail crossing in 1889. Construction took eight years to complete at a cost of £3.2million, around £235million today

Officials have been invited to prepare a formal nomination, which could go forward in 2014, with Unesco then expected to make a final decision on heritage status in June 2015.

Heritage Minister John Penrose described the crossing, which was completed in 1890 and carries about 200 trains a day, as a 'strong contender'.

If successful, it would be the sixth World Heritage Site in Scotland.

Scottish Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop said: 'The Forth Bridge is a Scottish icon that is recognised the world over.

'We are extremely excited that we have the opportunity to make the case for the bridge being inscribed as Scotland’s sixth World Heritage Site.

'To have the bridge inscribed as a Unesco World Heritage Site would be a tremendous accolade for the bridge itself, for the local communities and for Scotland.

'This nomination has the potential to be a celebration of our country’s incredible engineering ingenuity and pedigree, and I wish the team working on it all the best.'

The nomination will be overseen by the Forth Bridges Forum, which includes representatives from Historic Scotland, the Scottish Government agency charged with safeguarding the country’s historic environment, and bridge owners Network Rail, among others.

David Simpson, route managing director for Network Rail Scotland, described the crossing as 'one of the most recognisable bridges anywhere in the world'.

He added: 'The bridge has become a source of pride and a symbol of Scotland’s resilience and ingenuity but, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is first and foremost a working structure which still carries over 200 trains a day.

'This nomination should be regarded as a further tribute to the thousands of men who have contributed to building, maintaining and restoring the structure over the last 130 years.'

The Forth Rail Bridge is 2.5 kilometres (1.55 miles) long and was built with about 54,000 tonnes of steel and an estimated 6.5 million rivets.

Work started on it in 1882 and the project, which took eight years to complete, cost £3.2 million - equivalent to £235 million today.

Scottish Secretary Michael Moore hailed the structure as 'an iconic symbol of Scotland which is instantly recognised the world over'.

He also described the bridge as a 'huge feat of Scottish engineering skill' and said: 'It was nominated for Unesco World Heritage Status by the UK Government last year and the fact it has topped the list and can now take its bid forward is good news for Scotland.'

Gorham’s Cave Complex in Gibraltar - four sea caves lying at the base of the 426-metre high Rock of Gibraltar - has also been invited to prepare a nomination for World Heritage Status.

This could go forward in 2015, with a decision from Unesco then expected the following year.

Mr Penrose said: 'The UK’s heritage is unique, diverse and world-class.

'Nomination to Unesco for World Heritage Status is incredibly rewarding, but the process is pretty tough and success is by no means guaranteed.

'Both the Forth Bridge and Gorham’s Cave are strong contenders, so I wish them all the best.'

The current World Heritage Sites in Scotland are the Antonine Wall, St Kilda, New Lanark, the Heart of Neolithic Orkney and Edinburgh Old and New towns.

Antonine WallBuilt during the years following 142 AD on the orders of the Emperor Antoninus Pius, the wall was once the Roman Empire's most northen frontier in Britain.

The structure survived for a generation before being abandoned in the 160s in favour of a return to Hadrian's Wall.

It stretched for nearly 60km from Bo’ness on the River Forth to Old Kilpatrick on the River Clyde.St KildaThe archipelago, which is the remotest part of the British Isles, lies 66Km west of Benbecula in Scotland's Outer Hebrides.

People had lived there since prehistoric times, but the last islanders asked to be evacuated in 1930 because life on the remote archipelago had become too difficult, mainly as a result of tourism and World War I.

Edinburgh Old and New townsThese were made a World Heritage site in 1995 in recognition of their unique character.

The New town is considered a masterpiece is city planning. New LanarkThe 18th century restored cotton mill village on the banks of the River Clyde in Southern Scotland was inscribed by UNESCO in 2001.

It was created as a cotton-spinning village and was transformed under the management of Robert Owen, who improved conditions and facilities for the workers.

The Heart of Neolithic OrkneyThe group of Neolithic monuments on Orkney consists of a large chambered tomb (Maes Howe), two ceremonial stone circles (the Stones of Stenness and the Ring of Brodgar) and a settlement (Skara Brae), together with a number of unexcavated burial, ceremonial and settlement sites.

The group constitutes a major prehistoric cultural landscape which gives a graphic depiction of life in this remote archipelago in the far north of Scotland some 5,000 years ago.
