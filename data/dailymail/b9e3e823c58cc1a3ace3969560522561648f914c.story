A paragliding pensioner was left dangling 60m (200 feet) above the ground for three hours when he collided with a cable car wire.

Too high to be reached by ladder, he eventually had to cut himself free and lower himself down under guidance from rescuers.

The high drama played out in the Swiss Alps and began when 74-year-old Martin Bumgarner was blown off course in strong winds and became entangled in the support wire of a cable car at Wolfenschiessen, a village in the canton of Nidwalden in Switzerland.

Perilous: Martin Bumgarner was blown off course in strong winds and became entangled in the support wire of a cable car at Wolfenschiessen

Extreme danger: Mr Bumgarner was too high up to be rescued by ladder

Happy ending: Rescuers slid Mr Bumgarner a knife, rope and harness and in the end he was able to lower himself down

He would have fallen to a certain death if his parachute had come free.

Fortunately, there was a happy ending, but it was agonisingly touch and go for a while.

Mountain rescue boss Josef Odermatt said: 'Firemen did manage to put up a rescue cushion but it was always touch and go whether it would actually catch the man if he fell. He managed to get a shoe free and throw that down and based on where that landed was where the cushion was positioned, but again with the wind and other factors it was still very risky.'

Firemen then managed to get the rescue vehicle below the hanging paraglider and put up a ladder but it fell short and so that plan had to be abandoned as well.

In the end rescuers slid a radio, rope, harness and a very sharp knife along the wire to Mr Bumgarner in a small bag.

They then talked him through putting the harness on and cutting himself free from the parachute so that he could rescue himself.
