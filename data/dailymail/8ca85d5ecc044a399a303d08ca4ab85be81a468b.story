The excitement is mounting as Apple’s eagerly awaited iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus handsets go on sale tomorrow.

The queues outside Apple stores around the world are growing as fans line up to be the first to own the new smartphones.

People with prime spots outside these shops could also earn money for being so keen - with one place in New York already being sold for $2,500 (£1,500).

Almost there: Apple's eagerly awaited iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus handsets go on sale tomorrow. But this hasn't stopped fans queuing up outside Apple shops around the world so they can be among the first to own the new smartphones. This photo was taken of fans in Tokyo earlier today

Depaul UK, a national youth homelessness charity, is hoping to raise money by offering its place in the queue to the highest bidder.

Volunteers from Depaul UK have been queuing at the Apple Store in Oxford Circus since Wednesday for the new iPhone, which goes on sale tomorrow.

iPhone fans can search ‘Depaul spot 4 sale’ on eBay and bid for Depaul’s queue place, which will be sold off to the highest bidder.

All the money will go towards helping young people off the streets.

In Tokyo and Sydney, groups are camped outside in relatively balmy weather, while in London, tents were positioned outside the Apple Store on Regent Street.

Zoltan Wiettchen, 24, of Plaistow, east London, said he was first in the queue at the Regent's Street store and had been reserving a spot for his girlfriend.

'My girlfriend is over there sleeping in the first tent in the queue,' he said. 'I set up camp on September 8th at night.

'My girlfriend really wants a phone. We're expecting a lot of people to turn up today, over a thousand.'

He said he had been disturbed by revellers over the weekend, adding: 'I've had drunk people kicking the tent and pulling me out to take pictures while I sleep.

'Sometimes I wake up and the tent is open.'

Ethan Martin, 23, also in the queue, said: 'I have only been here since Wednesday and it's been okay.

Dedicated: Apple fans, some who have been there since Tuesday this week, queue outside the Apple store in the Bullring Shopping Centre in Birmingham, England

The first bite: Apple gadget fans queue outside the Apple store in Regent Street in London. One even decided to bring a blow-up armchair

'We wanted to beat the record, which had been 18 days,' Brian Ceballo, who arrived at Apple's NYC flagship on Sunday to wait, told CNBC.

One couple - Moon Ray, 25 and Jason, 29, were among seven people in new York queuing up a week ago.

They travelled over 1,000 miles (1,609km) from Jackson, Mississippi and arrived in New York on September 1 to find that they were not first in the queue, because cousins and New Yorkers Joseph Cruz and Brian Ceballo had beaten them to it.

The Mississippi couple paid $2,500 (£1,500) to swap places with the cousins.

Cosy queuing: A handful of fans have been queuing outside the firm's Fifth Avenue store since  September 3, when the phones were still a rumour. This means they will have been camping out for over two weeks

The wait is on: People with prime spots outside shops could earn money for their patience and some plan on selling their places in the queue for up to £1,000. Here, tents are pitched outside Apple's flagship store on London's Regent Street

Finally unveiled: Apple showed off two handsets last week as well as a smartwatch called Apple Watch. The iPhone 6 (pictured left) has a 4.7-inch screen, curved edges and will be available in dark black and gold, while the iPhone 6 Plus (right) has a 5.5-inch screen and 185 per cent more pixels than the 5S

Waiting with a friend: The iPhone 6 will start at $199 on a two-year contract for 16GB, $299 for 64GB and $399 for 128GB, while the iPhone 6 Plus starts at $299 for 16GB, $399 for 64GB and $499 for 128GB.

Selling out? While some people camping out 10 days before release are genuine fans, waiting to get their hands on the handset, others hope to sell their place in line. One person camped out in London (store pictured right) is hoping to get £1,000 for their efforts - which could buy them a couple of handsets at a later date

A couple who travelled more than 1,000 miles to stand in line outside the Apple store on Fifth Avenue, New York, have paid $2,500 (£1,500) to be first in line.

Moon Ray 25, and her husband Jason, 29 travelled from Jackson, Mississippi on September 1 to discover there was already a queue outside the shop.

Cousins Joseph Cruz and Brian Ceballo from Statten Island, New York had beaten them to it by one day – but happily accepted the money to switch places.

‘We take turns going to the bathroom and washing and working out at the gym nearby,’ Ms Moon said

‘We only sleep a couple of hours a night - I brought a tent but cried when they told me I couldn’t use it.’

Joseph, who was third in line last week, is a veteran at waiting in line for Apple product, having camped out for new releases before.

Ms Moon said: ‘People passing by say all sorts of things to us - they think we’re crazy.’

One of the tents is being manned by Task Rabbit, an online company that outsources household errands, after being paid by a client to queue up on their behalf.

Uma Subramanian of the firm, said: ‘We’re taking it in turns to man the tent for a client who requested our services online. I cannot say how much he paid us or who he is, because that’s confidential, but our workers charge between £10 and £20 an hour for whatever activity they have been paid to do.’

Apple unveiled its latest smartphone last week alongside its much hyped Apple Watch. The iPhone 6 has a 4.7-inch screen, curved edges and will be available in dark black and gold, while the iPhone 6 Plus has a 5.5-inch screen and 185 per cent more pixels than the 5S.

The iPhone 6 will start at $199 on a two-year contract for 16GB, $299 for 64GB and $399 for 128GB, while the iPhone 6 Plus starts at $299 for 16GB, $399 for 64GB and $499 for 128GB.

The iPhone 6 is 6.9mm and the iPhone 6 Plus is 7.1mm thick, compared to 7.6mm on the 5S. Both devices have Retina HD displays.

Both handsets feature the new Apple A8 64-bit chip, an 8MP camera and iOS 8 software, among a host of other features.
