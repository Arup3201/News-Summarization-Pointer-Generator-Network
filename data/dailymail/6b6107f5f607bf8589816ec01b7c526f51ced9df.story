A Spanish actress was caught faking her illustrious career by editing her face onto pictures of other celebrities before sharing them with her 22,000 Instagram followers.  

Anna Allen, 32, deleted her account after it was discovered that she had posted fake photos of herself supposedly attending this year's Oscars. According to Spanish outlets, she even gave an interview following the ceremony, claiming that she had spoken with host Neil Patrick Harris 'for a good while'.

But that was only a small part of Anna's Oscar-worthy social media performance.

Great lie: Spanish actress Anna Allen, 32, edited this image to make it look like she was posing on the red carpet at this year's Oscars

Prior to the event, Anna had taken and cropped Lupita Nyong’o's snapshot of her invitation to the 87th annual Academy Awards and posed it as her own. 

And for last year's Oscars, she superimposed her face onto one female attendee's body, although her deception had seemingly gone unnoticed.

In addition to her fake awards show appearances, Anna has edited photos to make it look as though she was guest starring on certain television series.

Stolen snapshots: Anna's posted a photo of her invitation to the Oscars, which was actually a cropped version of the picture that Lupita Nyong’o had shared on her Instagram account 

Imitation game: When Lupita shared this photo of her Academy Awards invitation, she wrote: 'It's official; I'm invited to the Oscars'

Anna claimed to be on set of The Big Bang Theory after she shared a photo of herself with the cast, but her followers were actually seeing her face on actress Summer Glau's body.

She did the same thing with actress Romola Garai's image in order to make it look like she was the one who starred alongside Jonny Lee Miller in the 2009 BBC mini-series Emma.

But what what may be the most shocking is how many photos Anna had taken from actress Sophia Bush and treated as her own.

She reposted numerous snapshots from Sophia's Instagram account, including pictures of the Chicago P.D. actress's shoes, work set and her travels.

For one of the stolen photos, she even rewrote Sophia's picture caption, which read: 'Touchdown. Momentary sunning in my Balenciaga boots before the big day ahead.'

While most celebrities are accused of Photoshopping their physical features for their Instagram photos, this may be the first time an actress has created an entire career based on the magic of picture editing.

Anna has since shut down her social media accounts, but that didn't stop her from becoming an Internet meme.

Online commenters have shared photos of Anna's face superimposed into other improbable situations, including scenes from Titanic and Ellen DeGeneres' A-list selfie from last year's Oscars.

Take words: She also copied Sophia's caption and posed it as her own 

Big joke: Even though Anna has shut down her social media accounts after her deception was discovered, she has still inspired numerous Internet memes, including this 'invite' to the Oscars from 'Meryl Skreeps'

Another Twitter user, superimposed Anna's face onto Leonardo DiCaprio's in this scene from Titanic
