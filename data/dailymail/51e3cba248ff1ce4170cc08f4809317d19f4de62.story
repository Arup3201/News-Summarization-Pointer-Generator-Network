Robin van Persie will miss Holland's final Group B game against Chile after picking up a second booking during the 3-2 victory over Australia on Wednesday.

The Dutch striker was shown a yellow card following a tussle with Australia defender Matthew Spiranovic in the 47th minute.

And Van Persie was fortunate not to see red after a rash challenge of Crystal Palace's Mile Jedinak, which prompted a furious response from Australia's players.

Van Persie, who was booked in the opening game against Spain for a late foul on Pedro, was replaced by substitute Jeremain Lens in the 87th minute.

He was booed off the pitch by the Socceroos contingent in Porto Alegre, probably as much for scoring his side's second goal as for his two rash challenges.
