A suspected drink driver has been publicly shamed by police who published a picture of his car after he drove off the road and plunged into a canal.

Giles Bond, 24, was rescued after he managed to climb out onto the roof as his vehicle started to sink into the murky water.

Afterwards the motorist suffered further embarrassment when officers in Cheshire tweeted a picture with the title: 'Drink driver finds himself in the drink', and added that his car 'wasn't a Morris Marina'.

Shamed: An alleged drink driver had to be rescued after plunging into this canal in an incident publicised by police on Twitter

The post led to responses like: 'It looks like he is in deep water' and was he driving a 'Renault Lagoon-a?'

Police and two fire crews were called to the scene at Sanbach Canal in Hall Lane, Ettiley Heath, in Cheshire on Sunday.

Firefighters used a canal boat to reach Bond, from Hassall, Cheshire, before taking him back to the canal tow path.

Officers then arrested him and he has since been charged with drink driving.

A Cheshire Fire and Rescue spokesperson said: 'We have water vessels in Warrington and Chester because that is where they are primarily used.

'But on this occasion firefighters took the decision to commandeer a canal boat to cross the water and rescue the man, as time was a factor.'

Bond is due to appear at Macclesfield Magistrates Court, in Cheshire, on April 10.
