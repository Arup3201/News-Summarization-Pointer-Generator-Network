The Duchess of Cambridge attended her first red carpet event since becoming a mother this evening.

31-year-old Kate beamed as she accompanied husband William to the Tusk foundation gala dinner at The Royal Society in London.

She wore a glittering floor-length Jenny Packham dress covered in sequins with her brunette hair carefully curled over her shoulders and simple, pretty make-up.

Kate finished the look with sparkling stiletto heels and diamond jewellery.

William, who wore smart black tie, is a patron of the Tusk charity, and expected to make a speech at the end of the awards ceremony which will be hosted by journalist Kate Silverton.

Tonight's awards aim to celebrate outstanding achievement in the field of African conservation, recognising the achievements of individuals who are ensuring the future of Africa and bringing the challenges faced by the continent to a global audience.

Natural beauty: The Duchess wore her hair loose around her shoulders, with understated make-up save for her dramatic smoky eyes

Important occasion: William is patron of the Tusk Foundation, and the couple's appearance at the gala dinner is their first since moving to London

Just last month, Kate made her first 
public appearance since the birth of Prince George when she attended the
Anglesey ultra-marathon with William.

Back
in her skinny jeans just five weeks after having her son on July 22, 
Kate looked sensational - without the slightest sign of baby fatigue - 
in a green tweed hacking jacket, Zara top and J Brand jeans.

Then,
Prince William had revealed that Kate was bearing the brunt of the 
night duties - and that their son was proving to be quite a nocturnal 
little fellow. 

Perfect in Packham: Kate's sleeveless gown flattered her already-slender post-baby body. The high neck and draped back added another layer of dimension and drama

Careful: She was sure to slightly pull up the front of the Packham gown to avoid disaster as she took the stairs in the floor length gown and towering heels

Finishing touches: The Duchess completed her look with her favourite size 38 1/2 silver snakeskin platform sandals by Jimmy Choo

Dapper: The Duke of Cambridge made sure his tie was straight and his jacket buttoned before he and his wife hit the red carpet

Despite that,
the Duchess appeared remarkably bright-eyed as she chatted with 
well-wishers from the island, thanking them for their hospitality and 
the kindness and warmth they had shown the couple during their time on 
Anglesey.

The Duchess 
revealed that her mother, Carole, - or granny as she called her - had 
come up to babysit, and told locals that he was 'sleeping well'. 'But I 
know these things suddenly change,' she added.

She mentioned during the visit she was keen to get 'back into shape' after the birth.

Tonight's outing marks the start of a new role for William as he begins a new life outside the military.

Kensington Palace today announced that
Prince William has completed his final duties as a search and rescue 
helicopter pilot with the RAF.

The
Duke of Cambridge is now looking to expand his charity work, 
particularly in the field of conservation and endangered species, making
tonight's event all the more significant.

William,
who carried out his last operational shift on Tuesday, is to continue 
to carry out royal engagements but is not expected to increase his 
number of public duties.

No doubt that the couple are looking forward to having a lie in with William done serving - if baby George will comply

The Duchess appeared to enjoy her night out after her time at home - but was no doubt looking forward to seeing the baby back at home

Sources have said the prince is in a 'transitional' year and is considering options for his 'public service'.

The two are making final arrangements for their move into Kensington Palace, which will become their London base after leaving Anglesey.

The couple, who went to live with Kate's parents, Michael and
Carole Middleton, at their £4.8 million mansion in Bucklebury, 
Berkshire after the birth of Prince George, are to say goodbye to the island that has been William's home for three years, or two for Kate.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge got a fit of the giggles as they officially started the Ultra Marathon at the Breakwater Country Park in Holyhead

A source told MailOnline: 'Initially the Duchess
wasn't going to attend but she was also keen for the chance to thank 
the people of Anglesey herself for the warmth and hospitality they have 
shown her and the Duke.'
