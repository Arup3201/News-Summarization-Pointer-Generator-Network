For two years, cerebral palsy sufferer Ben Baddeley dreamt of the life-changing operation that would one day let him play football with his little brother.

Then, after the nine-year-old had endured gruelling preparation for the surgery, his dream was shattered by the NHS cancelling the operation just weeks before it was due.

His mother Amy had to break the news to him after receiving a letter from Queen’s Medical Centre in Nottingham which blamed the cancellation on cuts which had made the £20,000 surgery ‘unfundable’ by the NHS.

‘When I told him, he was completely devastated,’ Mrs Baddeley said. ‘He loves football. He just wanted to kick a ball with his brother without being in agony.’

Ben had already taught himself to walk, but his disability means it is painful for him and over time his mobility will deteriorate, leaving him wheelchair-bound and unable to play with brother Josh, five.

Mrs Baddeley, 29, added: ‘For the past two years, we’ve been told by doctors that Ben was on the list for the operation and we had to prepare for the surgery. When I received that letter I felt like I had let my little boy down.

‘It’s a particular blow to us that the
 NHS would cut back on operations, which could give children like Ben a 
brighter future, while still shelling out for people’s gastric bands and
 boob jobs.’

The family from
 Silverdale in Staffordshire have been helping Ben prepare for the 
operation since 2012, and now plan to take legal action against 
Nottingham University Hospitals Trust for cancelling at such short 
notice.

Ahead of the 
surgery, Ben had already undergone an hour-long MRI scan under general 
anaesthetic and had stopped his regular Botox injections which help ease
 his muscle stiffness.

When families were made aware of the cuts earlier this year, the NHS promised to honour any operations that had been given a date.

Ben’s pre-operation baclofen procedure, which helps with muscle spasms, had been booked but because his final surgery had not been scheduled, the trust cancelled the first procedure – leaving the family to foot the bill for both that and the main operation on the nerves in his spine.

Mrs Baddeley and her husband Gary, a 37-year-old welder, now need to raise £11,400 for the operation to be done privately.

James Hunter, clinical director for the musculoskeletal directorate at Nottingham University Hospitals, said: ‘We have been in contact with parents of children referred to NUH to inform them we will not be proceeding with any further pre-operative tests.

‘It would be unfair on these children and their families for us to continue a process which may not result in surgery.’

Around 5,400 gastric bypasses and 1,300 gastric band procedures are performed by the NHS each year, while in 2012 it spent £3.5million on 790 breast implant operations.
