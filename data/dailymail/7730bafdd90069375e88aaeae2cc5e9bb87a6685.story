It's every Nintendo fan's dream come true - a real-life go kart that Super Mario himself would be proud to race through Bowser's Castle.

American gadget guru Ali Kermani, 34, has come up with a vehicle that not only goes forwards, but sideways and backwards.

'Crazy Cart' even allows drivers to spin and skid around corners thanks to a special control handle to help it 'drift' just like Mario and friends in the hit computer game Mario Kart.

But despite its runaway success, when Ali first came up with the idea, everybody called him crazy... so that's exactly what he called the fledgeling invention.

The high-school dropout came up with the brainchild while working as a skating equipment salesman from the back of his car almost a decade ago.

But when he took his idea to UCLA’s Anderson School of Management a decade ago, recruiters were incensed to hear he hoped to use his time there to develop the
 Crazy Cart.

'It was like something from a movie,' he told Bloomberg Business Week. 'She stood up and slammed her hand on the table. "If you think you’re coming to UCLA Anderson with a go-kart and being successful, then you have no idea what you’re in for."

'I told her, "If you think your opinion of my 
chances of being successful is going to stop my idea from being a 
success, you have no idea who you’re sitting across the table from."'

Luckily, though, his outburst paid off and the recruiter was so impressed by his passion that she not only accepted him on the course but secured a $20,000 grant to develop the project over the summer between his first and second year.

And as this 'ride guide' video shows, it has 360-degree steering and a drift bar for managing spins, drifts, and cornering.

It also has two driving modes: 'go-kart mode' for normal driving, and 'crazy cart mode' for drifting.

Manufacturer Razor previously made a smaller version for children, but has now decided to manufacture an adult one.

Initial
 prototypes hit problems, the firm found, as they would not fit through 
doors, but a new slightly slimmer model is now on sale.

Kermani, along with the development team at Razor USA, worked on the Crazy Cart for nine years until it hit stores in the U.S., Canada and Australia in 2013.

'The Crazy Cart’s success is an amazing 
metaphor for the incredible ride we've experienced since we first 
introduced the original Razor kick scooter to America,' said Razor’s 
Founder and President, Carlton Calvin. 'Razor’s goal is to find 
innovative ride-ons with break-out appeal, and the Crazy Cart is 
absolutely living up to our hopes as one of the hottest products in our 
13-year history.'
