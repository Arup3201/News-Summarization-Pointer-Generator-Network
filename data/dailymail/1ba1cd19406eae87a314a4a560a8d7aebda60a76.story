Prime Minister Tony Abbott has come under fire from Irish leaders  who dubbed his St Patrick's Day video message 'patrionising'.

Mr Abbott said St Patrick's Day is a 'great day for the Irish...and anyone else who wants to come to a party', and that it is the 'one day of the year when it's good to be green,' in the video posted to the Liberal Party's YouTube page. 

'This is the love of  life and good humour the Irish have given Australia,' he continued. 

'As you can see, I've got my green tie on for the occasion.' Tony Abbott has come under fire for his 'patronising' St Patrick's Day message 

'It has been said that the English made the laws, the Scots made the money and the Irish made the songs,' Mr Abbott says in the video

'It has been said that the English made the laws, the Scots made the money and the Irish made the songs.' 

An Irish businessman in Australia said the Prime Minister's message is 'patronising', according to the Irish Times.

'I would have hoped for a more business-focussed message in a video that was designed for business functions,' he said. 

'There are so many good stories of Irish people in business in Australia, Mr Abbott's lack of awareness of any of that is astonishing.' 

The video was supplied to both the Irish Australian Chamber of Commerce and the Lansdowne Club to be played during St Patrick's Day celebrations, but reportedly neither party will show it.

The Lansdowne Club said it was unable to find space on the day's schedule to show the 70-second video.

The video was supplied to both the Irish Australian Chamber of Commerce and the Lansdowne Club to be played during St Patrick's Day celebrations, but reportedly neither party will show it.

Irish Australian Chamber of Commerce Chief Executive Barry Corr said the video was 'a generic St Patrick's Day message' and 'on that basis it is not part of the event'.

More than 2000 people are expected to attend sold-out events at the Irish Australian Chamber of Commerce in Melbourne and the Lansdowne Club in Sydney.

Mr Abbott concluded the video message by apologising for not being able to attend celebrations, and not being able to 'share a Guinness or two, or even three'.

St Patrick's Day is March 17.
