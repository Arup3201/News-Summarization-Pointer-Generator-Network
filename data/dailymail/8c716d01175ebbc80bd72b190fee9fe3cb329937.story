Actors from privileged backgrounds dominate film and television, the chair of BAFTA Anne Morrison (above) has claimed

Actors from privileged backgrounds dominate film and television, the chair of BAFTA has claimed.

Anne Morrison said more should be done to ensure underprivileged actors can crack the industry.

Ms Morrison, the second woman to take the chair post, is particularly concerned that films will start to reflect just one demographic, as 'supremely talented' students from poorer backgrounds are missing out.

Speaking to the Evening Standard, she said: 'We want a truly diverse industry, we want to hear stories from everybody. 

'We should celebrate all people who succeed, privileged or not, but we do need to intervene and help those whose talents would otherwise be lost to us.'

The spat over whether the arts world is dominated by privileged people started after a Labour MP criticised the number of posh actors and musicians in Britain.

Chris Bryant, shadow minister for the arts, referred specifically to boarding school stars such as singer James Blunt and Oscar-winner Eddie Redmayne in his rant.

Mr Bryant, who attended the £20,000-a-year Cheltenham College, said that 'their ilk' were creating a 'cultural drought'.

The remarks sparked a furious response from Harrow-educated Blunt, who retorted by calling Mr Bryant a 'prejudiced wazzock' and blamed him for using the 'politics of jealousy' to win votes.

In a letter to the MP, the You're Beautiful singer said: 'I happened to go to a boarding school. No one helped me at boarding school to get into the music business.

'I bought my first guitar with money I saved from holiday jobs (sandwich packing!).'

But Mr Bryant hit back at the pop star's online attack and criticised him further for being 'so blooming precious'.

Other actors have since weighed in on the row.

Benedict Cumberbatch raised eyebrows when he said that he was considering moving to the US because he was fed up with being 'castigated' for his public school background.

And Laurence Fox, who also attended Harrow, came out in support of Blunt and said: ‘It’s a relief to come out. I’m a posh British man. And proud.’  

But Julie Walters, who was awarded a full grant to study at Manchester Polytechnic, said that working-class children were not represented in the industry.

'It's really sad. I think it means that we're going to get loads more middle-class drama,' she told the Guardian Weekend magazine at the end of January. 

The You're Beautiful singer reignited the row with Mr Bryant less than a week later on Twitter and told the MP to give people 'a ladder, not a bow and arrow'

Dame Judi Dench (left) and Julie Walters (right) have also weighed in on the debate, both supporting the idea that not enough is done to get working class actors into the industry 

Dame Judi Dench similarly claimed last year that acting had become elitist, citing that young people could not afford to attend drama school or go to the theatre anymore.  

The Oscar-award winning star, who attended the private Mount School in York where fees cost £8,700 a year, blamed financial barriers to training for the problem.

Ms Morrison's comments come just a week after the Oscars and at the same time BAFTA launched its annual scholarship scheme.

The scheme is described on the BAFTA website as 'scholarships to UK students in need of financial assistance to take a post-graduate course related to a career in film, television or games'. 

Students will be awarded £10,000 so they can take up a course and will also be given a personal mentor and access to BAFTA events throughout the year.
